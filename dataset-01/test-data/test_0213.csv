1,"Probably really great, but...",Just received the CD ROM in the mail and opened it up to put in my disk drive and... it didn't work. Reason - because my computer is a Mac (Apple). On the product description it lists the many systems that it is compatible with including Macs (listed 2nd after Linux). Unfortunately this is not entirely true. I suppose if I install bootcamp and buy Windows Vista (or the like) I would be able to open the program.Just a warning to Mac users about this problem. I have an older version that worked only on OS 9 classic but I don't have classic anymore. My little son was so disappointed when the program wouldn't work on our Mac computer. Still looking for a compatible version. Hope they come out with universal new version soon.
3,Kid's review,"Pretty program but a bit frustrating.Why, because:1. There is only ONE step back UNDO which can ruin your work if you've almost finished it, and accidentally tap twice on your tablet.2. Slides cannot be removed from slide show once you have put them in.3. There is only ONE ZOOM level.4. The more you re-size an image the more blurred it gets.5. No layers, you have to be really good at merging images.6. Tools have limited sizing, the smallest size of the Paint brush is too large to fill in a regular sized gap.7. Fill tool doesn't recognize gray, only sharp black lines, so you may have to redraw imported images, or color-me images."
2,Not what I expected,"When something says 'white' I sort of expect to get something close to the colour white. I ordered three of these plates but they are closer to beige. They also have an odd matte finish that made them seem cheaply. However, they are large plates and at this price, probably good for entertaining if you need quite a few. The large ones would be good for holiday meals - those times when you really need extra serving pieces that you don't use the rest of the year."
2,Too much general information,I wasn't sure what audience author was trying to target as I read this book. The author tries to simplify too much information that takes entire college courses to understand such as space planning and color. This book is too complicated and dry for the home owner wishing to find information about decorating and is too basic for an interior designer.
1,Cloth Velcro backing came off foam pad,"I used this pad for about one hour each day on two different days about 10 days apart. I switched from the Cleaner Wax on Day 1 to the Ultimate Compound on Day 2, as the Cleaner Wax was not removing much of the oxidization on my RV. It appeared that the glue holding the Velcro cloth to the foam pad had melted."
2,I would not buy it..,My three-year-old daughter received this toy as a gift for Christmas. She likes to play with it and scare me and her father. As a parent I am concerned with the sharp claws on its hands and feet. His tail also has sharp points on it. This is not for the younger child. It does not do much and I don't feel you get get your monies worth out of this toy.
1,Ignorant,"This once popular book was written fifty years ago, and is not only hopelessly outdated, but was never ""indated"" in the first place. I remember as a gay college freshman sitting in a class near a girl with the paperback edition of this book. She started pointing at the various males and counting to six. I ducked. The only thing I remember about the contents is the absurdity of Stearn saying that gay men seemed to die young, and he could prove this by saying that he never saw any older men in gay bars."
4,general information about cars,"discussions such as ticket jeopardy , four prices of a new car,when and how to buy cars........little technical information, however, if a woman is on her own and has no knowledge of how to buy a car this would be a good book to read."
5,Kirk is Back.....and he aint playin',You know how you felt when you got a hold of Fred Hammonds Pages of Life ...in 1996'? Well this joint is a bround breaker like that. Every Choir will be singing everything on this CD (even 911 for the pastors)for years to come. This is absolutely his BEST work. He has really matured as a person and an as an artist. Everything Kirk does after this will be compared to this CD. This is a must have for evey collection.......
3,Disappointed,"I give the album 3 stars because any album glorifying the Lord deserves that much. HOWEVER...I am really disappointed that Kirk bowed to the wishes of traditional church folk and made an album that totally catered to them. The purpose of the Gospel is to feed the hungry (those who don't know Christ). His earlier albums perfectly balanced the purpose of ministering to the world while give the saved and satisfied ones some music to enjoy as well. Kirk took a lot of heat from church folks for incorporating hip-hop into his music but, in the midst of their mockery, many folks heard the message of Jesus in a language they could understand thanks to songs like ""Stomp!"". This album feeds those who are already presumably full with little to no attention to his earlier, more evangelistic message.I hope and pray that Kirk returns to his former style of music for his next album."
5,He's Back!...,"This album is very good!! I wasn't impressed with Kirk's album's that came out after the Nu Nation Project CD, because he was focusing a lot on himself and not on God, but this CD is totally different. It's all about God and not about him. As a matter of fact, the name of the CD, The Rebirth of Kirk Franklin, suits what the album is all about. The songs on this album will touch your heart and will encourage you. I especially like the song, ""Hosanna"" and ""Brighter Day"". Both of those songs are very creative and get you dancing on your feet! Kirk has great writing and music talent that's like none other, and if he keeps his mind on God and goes by the leading of the Holy Spirit, God will take him to another level and he will be able to touch many lives through music. Congratulations Kirk on this album!"
4,Kirk CD,"The CD itself is great. But the CD arrived with a huge crack across the front of the case. Dont know if it left the shipper that way or if it happened in transit, but I had to get a different case for it."
5,THE BEST EVER IT ROCK!!!!!!!,"this game rock it about solving thing and it cool some of it is hard to do in the game. you should buy this game, because you can duel with someone and get a new card if you beat a computer and it fun for a real long time you should try it once you try it you never gonna get tire of it"
4,Great Game,"I think the game is great. The most funnest part of the game is that your able to commbine to make 100's of diffrent monsters,magics and traps. Is entertaining and I don't care how bad people think of the game is, this is a really fun game and Yu-Gi-Oh fans should try it for them selves.This game ROCKS!"
4,Its great i just cant give it 5 stars,This game is great but theres one thing i dont like about it you have no idea what makes what with fusion and your opponent does trust me i have this game. DO NOT FACE HEISHIN WITHOUT THE MOST POWERFUL CARDS YOU CAN FIND! He has a dragon type monster that can kill a blue-eyes ULTIMATE DRAGON!!!!!! and going into battle with Seto ancient egypt is easier with knowledge of good fusions or powerful cards in your deck or even better both.
4,Yu-Gi-Oh Best game ever,"well i took me awhile to find it but i got at a little place called target,Well i was so excited i started to play and u auto matically get beat by some preist it dont matter though cus now your yugi playing againsit all the characters from the game then its back to egypt.all in all this game has great game play and fairly good animation but the best part is the card combinations."
4,Handsome home addition,"We considered many options for a nightlight in a prominent location in our home. The others were as expensive but made of plastic components that were ghastly up close. This piece is all glass and metal, and evokes an understated tastefulness. We're very happy with it. We'd have given it 5-stars, but the one caveat is that being flat, it cannot adorn the other sides of the nightlight, or filter the otherwise strong direct light. Other than that, though, our family is very happy with the purchase."
1,"If you loved or even liked Crude please, please, PLEASE read the following.","First of all, what is happening to those people in Ecuador is nothing short of tragic. No human being should be made to endure such conditions. That being said please, please, PLEASE go and read the following document from the Southern District Court of New York: 11 Civ. 0691 (LAK) [just type in the citation at google, you do not need access to a legal database to view this document]. If you do not have a particular talent for reading court papers then at least go see the outtake clips at [...]"
2,Cut in half for the love of. . .,"It could have been better if it had been cut more then it already had been done. The basic premise and satire of the novel was a good one but it was overly done and trying to make his point about the town jumped around at times too much, as if he wanted to expose the small town for its bad nature but yet love the town for its simpleton ways. There were some good Characters, Carol was not completely the great heroine nor was she the evil incarnate, and Miles was good as well, the others were one sided more than these two as Lewis was trying to hard for an expose."
4,Lewis' Carol.,"A great novel written about 90 years ago that still resonates today.This indictment of small-town life, and more importantly of small-minded people, is written in Lewis' very dense prose style, which can be a bit off-putting for a modern reader, yet is quite rewarding in its detailed and moving portrait of a woman (Carol Kennicott), driven to despair and at times apathy over her fate as a former big-city girl now trapped in a small, lifeless, unimaginative village."
4,classic tale of an idealist in a small town,"In this classic novel, newlywed Carol Kennicott moves from a city to the small town her doctor husband calls home and must struggle to survive a social and cultural environment she finds oppressive. College-educated and ambitious, she is frustrated with the town's lack of artistic and cultural endeavors and her attempts to raise local standards are met with disapproval.""Main Street""'s strongest point is its humor: through dialogue and description, Lewis paints a detailed picture of Carol and her neighbors - their thoughts, plans, manipulations and foibles, particularly those they all have in common. The book is both powerful and frustrating, since the issue it raises (how to fulfill any but the meanest aspirations in the context of the trivial daily lives most people live) is still applicable, and since the book offers little in the way of solution."
3,Sad,I have only played this game once and let me tell you that some baseball games on gbc are better than this one.
2,"Same Old, Same Old","I'm afraid I have to agree with the two star review below. The problem with this collection is that it is just more of the same old same old that RCA has been releasing for years. Of the 16 tracks here, all but 3 or 4 are already available on many, many, MANY other collections and so we are left being asked to pay some 12 bucks for a handful of songs. Why won't RCA either release all of Dolly's older albums or at least give us a comprehensive compilation of that period instead of repackaging the same songs over and over and over and over and over........."
2,caution: only listen to this with decaf,"I've owned this set for two years now and have really tried to get into it. Initially it sounds beautifully recorded and fast paced, but after 15 minutes I surrender. The recording sounds bright with very little emotion. Well played, but no soul. If you want to hear how completely different the same music can sound, listen to the Cleveland Quartet doing Beethoven. I have bought a number of the Emersons CDs and sadly the pattern in my opinion is much the same - exceptional musicans displaying how well they can perform. I actually think their ""fast/in your face"" style would be engaging in a live performance, but I've yet to hear an Emerson CD that I'd call a first recommendation."
1,The One Star Rating is Too High,"There should be a ""0"" or ""Bomb"" rating available. This is truly one of the most lackluster books I have ever read. Or one of the least luster-equipped. It is luster-challenged; however you want to put it.It looks as if Mr. Idle thought very carefully about theories of comedy and then used a pub napkin to sketch out a plot to wrap around the theories.Very disappointing."
3,Something different,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. Although I can't say that I entirely agree with the author's theories on comedy (assuming they are actually his in reality) I found the book to be a good read simply in itself. I must admit, however, that there were times that I found myself reading past some of the more involved explanations of how comedy and comedians work. If you're just after an adventure then this is not for you, but if you'd like some insights into how the mind of one of the world's better comedians works then read on."
4,"What's with all the obtuseness, here, reviewers?,","Eric Idle has written a very entertaining book. Plot twists at the end? Come-on. As far as I can tell, there was no plot twist, maybe I'm just stupid. But look, the narrator get's more and more opportunistic/careerist throughout, did you expect that he wouldn't get his comeuppance? The whole Carlton/Comus/Wallace plot was straining to a denoument. And it was a very perfect denoument at that. What do you want? BTW 'Comus' was the Latin god of comedy, was he not? I really see a movie in this: I see Max von Sydow as Keppler, Tammy Faye Baker as Wooley, Peter O'toole as Charles Jay Brown, Catherine Zeta Jones as Katy Wallace, and two relative unknowns as the two comics. David Bowie has to be Carlton, of course. The comic theory spottily presented has many unattributed references to Desmond Morris, maybe others. All of which Eric Idle would deny, of course."
3,He may want to stick to sketch comedy...,"Probably a good read for any Idle or Python fans who want to complete the canon, but for most other sci-fi lovers, ""The Road to Mars"" is a merely passable novel. The characters are not really vivid, things are not terribly well-explained, and Idle's glib and self-deprecating references to Python and himself lack the spark that fans have come to associate with this group of guys.""The Road to Mars"" is not a bad book, but neither is it a good one. If you must, wait for the paperback."
3,The Road To Mars is hilarious,"This ""post-modem"" novel is about an android who works for a couple of comedians from the 22nd century traveling the outer vaudeville circuit of the solar system. This book made me laugh: not the generalized laugh of ""Ha-ha, that's funny!"" but the laugh of implausibility. Of ""hee-hee"" like I used to do watching Monty Python's Flying Circus. It wasn't until I'd finished that I looked at the author's picture on the flyleaf & recognized who Eric Idle was, realized why I'd chuckled at the improbability of the plot as it thickened."
1,embarassingly ordinary,"as a huge fan of his other work, and of humourous scifi in general, i can hardly begin to tell you how disappointed i was with this book. his editor seems to have decided that it would be too hard to edit the manuscript into any kind of reasonable shape, and has instead relied on the author's fame to sell the book and win the readers. Some funny jokes, sure, and some well researched history, cool... but jeez, this was the classic celebrity's first novel in all its horror!"
4,"After a bumpy start, the books is funny and suspenseful.","When I first began to read the book, I was expected more silly humor along the lines of ""Monty Python"". Mr. Idle, and the rest of the world have matured a bit though. Nevertheless, as I settled into the novel, I truly enjoyed it. Carlton, the Bowie-class robot, is truly the hero of the novel in his attempt to define what comedy is, and save his human masters from terrorists. I can picture this as a movie, as Mr. Idle has referred to in his interview, but the book is a good, easy read. If you like Douglas Adams, then you will like ""The Road to Mars""."
2,Too small to be considered acurate,"I bought this as a gag gift for my dad. When he got it, it was way too short, only coming up to about his knees. I was disappointed in the height, but otherwise, the product was as described. It is not a ""sex doll"", which is what I wanted. Also, it doesn't stay inflated for more than an hour or so, and he is constantly blowing her up, which is a pain. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are a short person who only wants to hang her up somewhere or keep on a chair or sofa. And keep your lungs full of air while you're at it."
2,not very durable,"after 2 uses, the felt backing fell off making it useless on the Velcro backing plate. Re-gluing isn't my favorite pastime with new products."
2,Sturdy Case Many Degsign Flaws,"Has a lip around the screen that makes it difficult to use onscreen keyboard. Drops signal and therefore battery life significantly. Very sturdy and felt my phone would be safe in my pocket while working in the phone abusive environment i work in. I ended up switching back to my broken otter-box commuter until i could get a new one, because i had no signal most of the time."
2,Confused,"There were no instructions for this game, and it advertised coming with cards that were not in the box. I was very embarrassed when my niece and nephew tried to play it over Christmas!"
3,Stick with the first one,"I'd have to say that Gentry Lee should have never talked with Arthur C. Clarke. Mr. Clarke is a phenominal author who is the KING of sci-fi. Gentry Lee is a 2 bit smut peddler who loves violence and sex. Come on..Richard Wakefield was one of the greatest characters I have ever read about and he was destroyed so stupidly. For such an intelligent man, don't you think he would have known the humans would of killed him? Humans have this thing called ""self-preservation"" where you try to stay alive. The only cool thing about this book was the Octospider society. They had a very interesting biology and culture. Read Randezvous with Rama, and just imagine the rest. Trust me, what you create will be 100X better than what Mr. Lee can come up with."
5,Way to go Amazon,Have been waiting for this book series to come out in the Kindle edition. I love my physical books but it's great to be able to take all my favorite books where ever I go.....thank you amazon and keep getting all books into Kindle editions.
2,A dissapointing ending to a magnificent series,Once I started with Rendezvous with Rama I simply could not stop. I stayed awake all night reading these magnificent books. I cried when humanity destroyed the (*****) and I rejoyced when Richard saved the last remaining (***). The series was a roller coaster ride of emotions for me. Arthur C Clarke aptly illistrates just how evil humanity can be and yet how compassionate we can be also. The Rama Series would be the best series I have ever read and I give the series a 10 out of 10 overall. However I think the meaning of life portrayed in the ending was a major let down considering the great potential the series held out as it unfolded.
1,"Boredom, Enforced","Shallow, one-dimensional characters, an artifically convoluted plot that never satisfactorily resolves, and bombastic writing of the sort best edited with a shredder. What more could one ask for? Why, sententious spiritual pretensions, of course!This is the sort of reading that makes you think longingly of scrubbing the bathtub grout with bleach and a baby toothbrush. I look at my stack of Rama books as I would five empty Pringle's cans - with a combination of nausea and self loathing.Clark should be spanked, Lee caned, and the publisher fined."
5,thoroughly indulging,"I read through this book in a day, you can't put it down every chapter ends with a cliff hanger. I must say that the Rama series is one of the best multi book series I have read in a long long time. A definite read for a sci-fi reader."
3,Rama - a funny experiment(of future and present),"......no,no,no it is a nightmare.....then i woke up.....oh oh oh aha the review....So,the book is like a coin it all depends on a way you turn the books contetext.But its a wonderfull mix of future and present humanity.Its a summer kind reading if you need a book to get rid of boredom and just have a space adventure run for it!"
5,"Awesome, but kick Gentry Lee","Gee, Mr Lee, why don't you kill arthur c clarkes work even more ? You can really tell what parts A.C.C wrote, and what Gentry Lee wrote. Lee is bad, and Clarke is good. Anyway, this book is quite good."
2,A terrible disappointment...,"""Rendezvous With Rama"" is one of my favorite books. I can easily believe it could be real while reading it, and the size of the space vehicle along with the clear descriptions of the weather inside, the view from one side to the other and countless other such things makes the book (at least for me) unique.I felt each book after the first got weaker, and by the time I got to this ending book of the series, I finished it ONLY because I had read the others.From reading other reviews here, many people, or at least quite a few, felt as I do. The story went on too long and eventually got ruined."
1,Has Arthur C Clark lost all of his talent?,"Please, God, don't read this book... sorry, I forgot that God was a petty, self-serving egotist who would happily destroy our universe if we fail to dedicate ourselves to mindless worship.Rendezvous with Rama was a classic, breath-taking work that allowed your mind to wander and wonder through a marvelous adventure. Each of the sequels got progressively worse until you find yourself wondering if Clarke's advanced age finally got him fearing his own mortality. The emotions left at the conclusion of this book were anger and disappointment."
3,The music clips are not helpful,"I am positive that this CD has more potential but if the sound clips are just about the beginning Taksim rhythm, then it's bad. I need to here more than just taksim, I need the beat."
3,IT band Wrap,Good item but did not fix my IT band problem. The best fix it go to the physical therapy.
2,works but lacks comfort and won't stay in place,"I purchased this IT band to use during long distance hikes. First, I tested it by walking around my home. However, when I removed it, a rash had formed on my leg under the band. This surprised me, but I assumed that I had wrapped it too tight. On my hike (25 miles), the band would not stay in place (obviously, I was sweating). I tried several adjustments, but eventually gave up and it slid down close to my knee cap. At the end of the hike, I saw that it had rubbed a sore on my leg (about an inch long). So, in the area of comfort and staying in place, it fails on both accounts. The product description specifically says that the band is comfortable and stays in place. This was not the case with me.Nevertheless, the band held my IT band in place, so I'll rate the item with two stars. I'm returning the unit to Amazon."
3,It worked for a while...,It worked until the weather got warm. Then I started sweating while running and the band will not stay in place no matter how tightly I make it. I have to stop every few minutes to pull it back up. I have no idea how to remedy this???
4,IT band problems fixed,"It really helped me run, hike, and be active. Lessened the pain, but there is no magic cure for IT band syndrome. This just helps but does not fix the problem!"
2,lliotibial Band.,Band is well made but did not help with the problem I am having which is pain down the left front ofmy left leg. Stretching seems to help the most.
3,Latex alert,"I loved it until I broke out in a perfect band around my knee 24 hours later. I'm allergic to latex, so if you have any allergies to it, DO NOT order this!! I wish this was stated in description."
3,Geils without Wolf,"This is an album the remaining members of the J. Geils Band made after Peter Wolf left. This is more of their late-period poppy hooky ""Angel is a Centerfold"" type stuff. Seth Justman and Stephen Bladd fill in as well as they can for Peter Wolf. Some of the tunes are actually catchy, and the album makes for pleasant enough listening, but basically this project was a pointless fiasco.It's not as big a fiasco as those albums the Doors made after Jim Morrison died. It's almost as good as the album the Sex Pistols made without Johnny Rotten. Happily in this case, Peter Wolf is still alive, as are the other members of the Band, and over 20 years have gone by with no reunion, but maybe someday..."
1,Racial Slurs?,"It is ridiculous to consider Song of the South a movie that causes Racial Slurs. More people loved Uncle Remis than ever loved Shaft in his pimp clothes. Why don't they ban that piece of crap movie. Besides, they were people like Uncle Remis and Aunt Jemima - was Butterfly McQueen a cartoon? If it is okay to rewrite history because some people are uncomfortable about the way their ancestors behaved, I guess that would make a great case for the history revisionists who want to publish books saying 10 million people didn't die in concentration camps under Nazi Germany. Hey, Aryans have feelings too; and that racial stereotype is alot more ugly than a sweet old man telling wonderful stories."
1,Caution,"I bought this tape because the search engine brought it up when I asked for ""Song Of The South"". It is just a tape of sing-a-long children songs which includes Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah from Song Of The South. A good tape if that is what you really wanted."
5,Mark Baldwin at his best!,"""Shades of Light"" quickly moved to the top of my ""most favorite CD"" list -and my list includes a little bit of everything. This is a spiritually inspired, warm and gutsy expression of ""art from the heart""! Baldwin once again delivers to the listener a contemplative and encouraging ""road trip"" for the mind. Baldwin's mastery with a guitar is matched only by his industry-proven expertise as an arranger and producer; you won't find a better recording of music! I so appreciate Baldwin's committment to expressing his own unique, unfiltered and unequaled ""groove"" in every project he's involved in, no matter where his name shows up in the credits. Light acoustic-style jazz with a kick has never sounded this good. The only problem I find with ""Shades of Light"" is that it leaves me hungry for ""Shades of Light 2""!"
3,Not worth the money,Yeah it helps to keep the camera steady but it is worth $300.00?Not in my opinion.It looks more like a $80.00 item.
5,"Easy to apply, good protection",This is easy to apply and it offers easily 6+ months of good protection. Since it is an easy on product it doesn't offer much cleaning power by design.
2,Worked...,The first time I used this it was fine but there needs to be a warning label that it isn't safe for dishwasher use. I have a hot water dishwasher that has no heating elements and this tray still warped to the point that I cannot use it again.
5,A beautiful chapbook by one of America's best young writers,"The folks at sunnyoutside have produced another beautiful chapbook with sharp artwork and text printed on the nicest paper my hands have ever touched. Mine arrived in the mail today, and I couldn't be happier. Each part of it is made or assembled by hand.The story is a fun romp through the desert. If you haven't read this author's other work -- Leaving Disneyland or In the Shadows of the Sun -- I recommend picking them up while you're here at Amazon."
3,"Exciting, BUT...",Why do all of these Star Trek author keep coming up with new races of the Federation. In this book they just look like Deltans with lines on their heads. How cheesy!
3,Well written but...,"I found it hard to put Black for Remembrance down because each chapter ended with a cliffhanger that left me wondering what would happen next. However, the book is not as suspenseful as it could be because some of the suspects get killed."
1,Too much down-time,"My Watchdog has been available as a viable back-up 10 percent of the time I've had it. I bought this as a back-up system, and I have experienced the same problems with the battery maintenance. Mine has not been in an ""available"" status for quite some time. Just before hurricane Irene I serviced the system to get it back up and on-line, unsuccessfully. The ""BATTERY"" alarm is still beeping, as I type, even after cleaning the terminals and filling-up with distilled. I likely need more acid, and this is such a pain in the rear end."
2,Did not last so long....,"A lot of people really liked this bag and I loved it when it was first purchased. But after about 6 months of use it got thrown away. It does not hold it's shape very well. Things would fall out of it when it was sat down and since it got dirty so easily I felt like I was forever washing it and that made it worse. The changing pad fell apart after 3 months, my zipper came off my mommy bag shortly there after, and we had to switch to some thing less frilly and more practical."
3,"A respectable, but somewhat unfulfilling, biography","I enjoy reading biographies immensely and I have to say that as far as biographies go, this one was disappointing. There was hardly any new information on George W. Bush in this book. More importantly, there was no real analysis of the main character. The author never really seeks to understand or explore his subject. I really hope that another biography of ""The First Son"" comes out soon. There is much room for improvement."
2,mildly cheese flavored packing peanuts,"Not at all a ""healthy"" snack, though better than some. I was disappointed by the mild cheese flavor, preferring more cheddar flavor. The texture is truly much like Styrofoam packing peanuts. I just don't understand what all the fuss is about. They're just ""OK""."
1,Aged cheddar gives me sinus infection,"Tastes great, addictive but I always get a sore throat and I am coughing up a lot of mucus within 24 hours of eating it. The aged cheddar flavr"
5,My kids love them and so do my nephews!!!!!!,My kids are addicted to this stuff. They take in there lunch instead of chips. This past summer all the kids at the pool called me the snack lady. I would load up the snack bag and all the kids would fight over the bags of pirate booty. I got my best friend to buy it when I started giving it to her boys. All they have to do is see the bag and they get excited. These are very yummy without all the unwanted chemicals and food additives. I 100 % recommend this to anyone. I am a Pirate Booty Pusher!
3,From a vet student,"Pros: It is easy to read, not incredibly boring, when it provides good information, it does so in an easy to understand way.Cons: Contradictory information, the steps are not well organized, sometimes you cut through muscle you later find out you should have saved."
4,Excellent Handel Program,"This is a wonderfully varied and well-thought-out recital of Handel's music for mezzo-soprano (or the castrato voice, in the case of many of these arias). The orchestral pieces are short but well-chosen, the playing is excellent, and Sarah Connolly is wonderful singer. Not the sublime territory of Lorraine Hunt or David Daniels, but close. Her performance of ""Scherza Infida"" from Ariodante is one of the best I've heard. The real treat on this recording is the monumental accompanied recitative from Hercules, ""Where shall I fly?"" a remarkably modern-sounding piece that deconstructs baroque musical conventions to a fare-thee-well. Highly recommended."
1,Great Movie! Terrible DVD!,"First off, this particular DVD is not uncut even though they list it as 76 minutes on both the box and DVD - it actually has a running time of 56 minutes. The picture quality is just okay, very fuzzy. The audio and video are out-of-sync by a good 2-3 seconds, which makes it unwatchable.There are some really nice DVD transfers of Roy & Dale's movies out there, this is not one of them."
4,Earth & Sun & Moon meets Redneck Wonderland,"Another solid Oils album. I've been a fan since Diesel and Dust and have all their stuff. I'd rate this one toward the top of the heap. If you liked Earth & Sun & Moon, this one is more aggressive, but not nearly as aggressive as Redneck Wonderland (their masterpiece if you ask me). They've still got it."
4,"An odd assortment of ""Love???"" songs...but it's still good!","This is one incredibly diverse collection cd of songs that are about ""love""....hmmm....well,be that as it may,these are the top singers and musicians of our times and each track is well performed and well recorded.Special mention,though, must go to track 20,""Pur Ti Miro"" by Claudio Monteverdi.Dana Blanchard and Sylvia McNair melt me with their rendition of this famous Renaissance love song.Their voices are perfect complements to each others. I don't understand the placing of the Scarlatti ""Pastorale"" Sonata, though, in this collection.Highly recommended for the price and quality."
5,wonderful products + customer service.,"Great products and amazing customer service. Will order again!Cucina products are wonderful and not only do they have a wonderful scent, they look beautiful in our office kitchen countertop!"
3,Do you like to feel good?,"Yeah...it may be ""corny"". But this cd is full of the wonderful bass of Roger Wittaker. Just don't expect a lot of meaningful lyrics. Just fun to listen to."
3,Disappointed,Had one of these over thirty years ago for my two boys. The main frame of this item was broken when it arrived. Was flimsy compared to the original one we had. Cost of returning ranged from over $20 USPS to over $40 UPS. Amazon issued a UPS pick up. Haven't heard from Amazon yet what thery will refund on shipping. Orginally was told $7.90. Only time will tell. Was not happy as this was to be a birthday gift for my granddaughter
2,Didn't work in Michigan,"My bird bath (in mid Michigan)is very busy, I have to add water and clean it daily. I thought why not try this attraction? Amazon sent it in double time as usual. After placeing it in the bird bath I noticed the water level didn't chang for two days. I then removed the unit and changed the water in the b.b., and within 2 minutes it was full of birds again. I'll try it again next spring."
3,Mediocre Angelina,"This is one of the many Angelina books which is still in the collection of childhood books which my Mother refuses to part with, despite the fact that they are all close to falling apart due to the numerous readings by my sisters and I. In my opinion, Angelina Ballerina has great watercolor like illustrations. However it lacks a certain sense of suspense and adventure which I always saw as essential characteristics of a great children's book."
2,Not That Great,"Some of the descriptive parts were nicely done, and the Kunan information was interesting. But as a story, it seriously lacked a driving plot with a good resolution. It just ended, flat. I don't get all the hype."
5,Broken A/p/r/i/l - An Appreciation,"This is a book you must read. It gives you a convincing picture of a completely alien culture and way of life, and death. From the opening lines it draws you deep into the deadful world of the Kanun, the ancient rituals which govern vendetta in Albania. It leads you through the corrupting influence which greedy men have had on a set of unofficial laws which, I believe must have been originally merciful in nature, set up to regulate the mass revenge killings endemic in ancient Albania. Blood money is paid to a powerful war-lord after each killing. He employs a factor to gather this money, and the factor is tormented by the problem of how to increase his lord's income from this practice so that he (the factor) can retain his position in the lord's household. Shudderingly horrifying!"
1,Semi-Pro DVD,This is one of the worst movies I have ever tried to watch. I would recommed no one spend their money on this one.
2,Not bad,The only reason I bought Semi-Pro is because Will Ferrell play's in it. I like Will Ferrell's movies. I never saw Semi-Pro before I received this movie. This first time I saw it I thought it sucked. I just finished watching Semi-Pro and I guess it's not that bad. My fav part is when they are playing the game and one guy on the team wants to fight. As soon as they are in commercial Will say's everybody hit someone and everyone starts to fight. That is my fav. part of the movie.
1,Hard to read. Hard to follow.,"I enjoy fictional books that use Biblical themes as a basis. This book was written using a biblical theme but not from a biblical perspective. The lead character was far from a biblical hero. But my biggest complaint was - I wasn't sure who was speaking during the dialogue portions or who they were speaking to. Many times the characters would be in a group and the author used ""he said"" or ""she said."" Who's speaking to whom? I dunno. I don't want to be unkind but I'm not interested in finding out what happens in the sequel."
4,Manual temperature adjustment relief,The Hunter 44550 was a very easy item to install; the wire labels makes even a novice installer feel confident. It took me roughly 15 minutes to complete the whole installation and maybe another 10 minutes to follow the daily programming instructions.We just got therefore I cannot say if the projected savings is true. But it definitely beats the manual adjustment one has to do with regular thermostat. No need to worry about forgetting.
1,Heating control is not accurate. Weekend schedule is not really adjustable.,Heating control is not accurate. It turns heating off at about +3 degree even though I set accuracy to +/-1. I guess the problem is the temporature sensor is not very sensitive. Weekend schedule is not really adjustable. It just drops off two middle schedules of your weekday schedule. I replaced it with Honeywell RTH230B. RTH230B is in the same price range as Robertsaw 9600 and overcomes the two problems above.
3,Difficulty rating: higher than the original!,"This is a fun way to test your family's knowledge of Bible trivia, but it's definitely more difficult than the original Scattergories. The cards aren't quite as durable either (hence my rating). My 12yo asks to play it to prove how smart she is; the optional rule of using any word that fits the category (not having to begin with letter rolled on the die) helps my 10yo. Overall, fun and educational."
2,"Very basic. If you are in HR, you could write this book","This book is about as basic as you can get. I would recommend it for someone who has never done any recruiting of any kind. If you are currently in recruiting and looking for new ideas, skip it."
5,Worked great on two cars,"I used this on two cars, and it made a real difference. Unless you're really careless, and don't follow directions, you won't wreck your finish. Soft pressure, with proper lubrication will visibly improve your finish. You can hear the difference running your hand over the polished and unpolished surfaces.Wax goes on easier and buffs off easier. I know because I only did half of my car, and based on that did my wife's entire car. The clayed surfaces of my car were 100% easier to wax, even with synthetic ""wax"" (Zaino, Megs Techwax, etc.)My wife's car had all kinds of little black spots in the paint from the factory in the lower panels. This took them out, and the final buffed surface felt like oil on glass.Highly recommend MILD (blue one) for a new car. Amazing how much better the paint looks.Do not use this every time you wash, except maybe on wheels for brake dust (use the aggressive red one). Get a good surface, use a good polish, and maintain."
5,love the shoes,These shoes are stylish and comfortable. They were exactly what I was looking for. The fit was excellent and the price a great deal.
4,very comfortable!,This is my second Birkenstock in my life and I do not want to wear any sandals other than this one.
2,they're comfy and durable but...,These shoes are great if you want to walk for years in them and they're so durable you could wear them every day but the problem here is that they last for a long time. This is the problem. They are shoes that are hard to pair with anything that isn't almost floor length and their bulkiness means that you have to wear flowing or wide-legged bottoms. They are a little pricey for what they are and the only real market they are suitable for is retirees. A shoe that is difficult to wear and uncomfortable for many buyers. Don't buy them unless you're sure you can wear them every day
5,Birkenstock Gizeh Birko-Flor Thong,"I was very happy with my purchase of a pair of silver birkenstocks. They arrived earlier then stated which was a bonus and are very very comfortable, worth every dollar."
2,"Durable, but not Comfortable","This shoe feels hard and tough so it won't fall apart anytime soon, but the sandal is not comfortable. For the price, I suppose I could have gotten much worse. If I could turn back the clock, I would have purchased a more expensive Birkenstock sandal and received one that is more comfortable. Not every Birenstock is made the same."
5,The perfect sandal,"I love these sandals,they are the most comfortable I have ever tried. I can walk all day in them right out of the box.They are attractive,exceptional quality of course.They arrived promptly from amazon,I am so pleased with them I will order a second pairThankyou Birkenstock,thankyou Amazon"
1,Disappointed,"This is the second pair of Birkenstocks I purchase. My first were great, comfortable and lasted a long time until they got stolen.It only took a few months for the front and sit clips to rust. The clips of my first pair were plastic while those of this pair were not. I emailed Birkenstock twice to see if they could be fixed. Never heard back from them and ended up throwing them away.I still purchased a third pair. They are not rusting but the black color on the front and side clips are is pealing off.Unfortunately that will be the last pair of Birkenstock I'll own."
1,"Horrible, just horrible",The author put no effort into this book. You get the feeling that it's a real rush job. Read the biography by Navarro and Frasher. It's the real deal!
5,IDoS,"I bought the book for a friend of mine, he liked the book very much. The book has information about submarines from WWI to the present day. I liked the book very much. This book is very informative you will find information from attack submarines to ballistis missiles submarines, diesel submarines, nuclear powered submarines. P. Corti."
3,vaguely heroic,"The average American doesn't know the name Harvey Pekar, the star of ""American Splendor,"" but the drawings of his comics are very recognizeable as the style of cartoonist Robert Crumb, the ""keep on truckin'"" guy. ""Splendor"" is the story of an average guy and his efforts to give meaning to a mundane life by translating it into comic form. The film uses an interesting technique of interspersing footage of the real life Pekar and the people in his life, which is successful since he is such a colorful character. The movie flows along well until the major conflict which dulled the experience for me."
2,Great movie about being a nobody,"I like this movie because I knew the Pekar story and the characters are perfectly cast. Pekars ""average joe"" world comes to life thanks to the screenplay using Pekars best comic work as it's source material. It's not the great american movie but it's not so far from that either."
5,American Splendor,"A well written, and acted movie. Paul Giamotti at his best as the comic book writer Harvey Pekar. Well worth the price."
1,"Dull, humdrum movie","Imagine your most boring acquaintance. The one you hide from to avoid tiresome stories about his/her humdrum existence. Then imagine a movie about said acquaintance, and you will have captured the essence of American Splendor. You will get to watch amazing scenes about a boring job, a lonely life, and secondary characters with nothing to say. Plus, the Pekar has a very annoying voice. At least they could have added a gratuitous shower scene. Avoid this movie"
4,"OK - if you don't have a MP3 player, this will do!","Guess this product is sort of superceeded by iPod's and other MP3 players, but if you have an old minidisc player and want extra capacity along with compatibility with your old MD's, this is the way to go. In the end it is now just another gadget in my drawer of toys, with very infrequent use. Sound is in my opinion better than mp3 format files, but limited storage 1G is still too small."
1,Buyer Beware,"This book that introduced the famous Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms for homology theory was published by Princeton University Press in 1952, not ""a reproduction of a book published before 1923."" as claimed here. Worse this is not even a usable reproduction of the book but was clumsily produced by using OCR software resulting in an unusable text. By contrast the original book is readily available second-hand often for a lower price."
1,boring and inexact,"the recipies in this book are plain and uninspired. they are also inexact. in the recipie for Tuna Noolde Casarole it calls for a bag of pasta. What type of pasta? How big a bag. I put a 1 lb bag of egg noodles in and tried to put it in the recomended size container, didn't fit. The sauce is also not nearly enough for the quantity (if you use 1 lb of egg noodles)."
1,"Don't bother, it's full of mistakes","It's not that I'm quibbling with Weber's answers, but his analytical section is awful. Some of Weber's answers violate the conditional rules he sets out. Other times, he'll say something like ""The answer is (E), Inga lives in apartment 211 or 214."" Check back to the original question and it says ""(D) Inga lives in apartment 211 or 214"". What's with that?Some of Weber's tips on solving analytical problems are useful, but his own questions are horrible. I scored a 760 on the GRE analytical when it was new and there were no books about it, so it's not like I can't figure this stuff out. Weber's questions make no sense and frequently have incorrect, or multiple correct answers. I haven't really tried the quantitative or verbal sections, so I won't comment on them."
1,Complete waste of money,This was the worst GRE book I've studied from. I bought a Barrons book as well as one published by ETS which were a lot more helpful. The math and analytical sections had tons of errors and many of the problems seen in the analytical section didn't parallel the actual test. Even a one star is too high of a rating for this book.
3,Cleaning could be more effective,Purchased it to remove light weathering stains from old but still glossy paint that has been stored outside for several months. I had been maintained using a Wash/Wax All In One product. The cleaner lightened the stains but did not remove them. There was no further increase in gloss over the Wash/Wax All product. Meguiar's recommended a more agressive cleaning compound.
2,Disappointed,[ASIN: 1583881565 FWD Firetrucks 1914-1963 Photo Archive]I ordered this book for an adult w/ development disabilities. He cannot read but LOVES firetrucks. The color pic on the coverlead me to believe the photos inside would also be color. What a disappointment to see the entire book is black & white!
5,Dawn is jealous,"Mrs. Pike wants Dawnto help prepare Margo and Claire for the Little Miss Stoneybrooke Contest. And Dawn wants her charges to win. the only trouble is Kristy, Claudia, Mary Anne are helping Karen, Myriah and Charlotte enter the contest too! And nobody's sure where the competition is fiercer: at the pegeant or at the baby sitters club?"
2,Nothing High Performance about this book!,"If you're expecting an introduction to Borland C++ Builder than this books for you. However if you're looking for a book with real insight into the product, don't waste your time or money on this one. It covers all the basics but that's it."
2,"Reasonable intro.... NOT ""High Performance""","If you're looking for in-depth advanced information on Borland C++ Builder, skip this book.It seems to be a reasonable introduction, but that's it.""High Performance""? I don't think so."
5,"If your shopping, then this one is a must","...Yup, there is history and fluff, but you can skip past those parts if you want. The author explains in detail, all the stuff that might come up when shoppinig and has correct recomendations as to what is okay and when you should keep looking."
1,You think kids like this sort of thing?,The story was a bit boring. Good thing bees were in abundance cause at least that made sense with all the 'zzzzzz' coming from my kids.Why can't children's authors get it right and be like Dr Seuss or 'Walter the Farting Dog'. Now those are books to let kids be kids!
5,Excellent resource book!,I purchased this book after starting a low carb lifestyle a year ago. This has been a TREMENDOUS resource book I've used over and over. The chapters are--1: The History and Origins of Low-Carb Diets2: Why Low-Carb Diets Work3: Seventeen Low-Carb Diets and What They Can Do For You4: Supplements and Diet Drugs5: The Five Biggest Myths About Low-Carb Diets6: Frequently Asked Questions7: Tricks of the Trade: The Top 50+ Tips for Making Low-Carb Work for You8: Controlled-Carbohydrate Eating: Putting Together Your ProgramThere is a great resource section at the end with tons of websites and materials for further readingI can honestly say this has been one of the best purchases I made when I decided to adopt a low carb lifestyle. You will NOT be sorry for investing in this book!
1,Worthless Drivel,"I felt that this book was a complete waste of my money, and I became of the opnion that the writers lacks even the slightest grasp on the subject on which he writes and it is clear that they they lack any kind of formal technical training on WiFi Network security, or for that matter on electronics in general. This book doesn't even raise itself to being worthy of being read by a script kiddy, and it just endless drivel. All the reader gains from this book is material he would have downloaded for free on hundreds of websites ten years back. The material in the book is a solid ten years out of date, either the authors got stuck in a time warp, or spent a little too much time of the Federal Witness Protection Program. In the case of this book the infromation is watered down to increase the page count. Much like much of other M.L. Shannon's works the material is not unique or original, and is just drivel and of no value."
3,Great story but it starts something terrible.,The Ark in Space was a good idea but it started Genesis of the Daleks which is terrible. Many people think it is good but look at it this way Davros is a human being with half his body in half a pepper pot and a piece of leftover rubber around his face. END
2,Right idea. Wrong approach.,"The authors speak of real problems, but address them ineffectively. By peddling generalizations of the white race, they perpetuate the victim/victimizer dichotomy which divides instead of uniting. Further, the boundary between victim and victimizer is drawn rigidly along racial lines. They fail to recognize that any progress has been made in the decades since the civil war toward a more loving, color blind society. This truly dishonors the memory of those whose blood and tears watered the garden from which African Americans now harvest financial and educational opportunities as well as self worth. A better discussion, in my opinion, can be found in Joel Kovel's book by the same title."
2,lots of typos,"This book has lots of great photos. It also seems to have a lot of information, but there are so many editing problems that I am reluctant to trust its technical and historical information.While I was reading it, I found typesetting issues, and many spelling errors. I was trying to enjoy it, not proofread it, so I'm sure careful scrutiny would uncover even more. Page 191 has at least nine errors! They include: ""thier"" instead of ""their"", ""their"" instead of ""there"" (twice!), ""ver"" instead of ""very"", and ""nublear ant-aircraft"" instead of ""nuclear anti-aircraft"".I really wanted to like this book, but the errors are so numerous and distracting, that I ultimately have to consider it a defective product. If only they had used a spell-checker and a proofreader, this could have been a five-star book. As it stands, it is merely a photo album with some captions might be correct."
1,NOT KBCO,This listing is really misleading as the disc has nothing to do with KBCO. This is not a KBCO Studio C release in any means. The songs were recorded at The Boulder Theatre. Don't be fooled like I was.
2,still looking for good tamale recipes,"I've had this book for years (a gift) and have finally made my first tamales. I used the plain masa dough recipe with my own filling. I doubled the recipe, as it hardly seems worth the effort to make a single recipe and end up with only 8 tamales. After steaming for 40 minutes (a few minutes longer than suggested), and cooling a bit I tried one. The masa dough tasted and felt way too oily, and the texture is just not right. I will be looking for a more traditional recipe source and trying again."
2,I thought this was a traditional tamale cookbook,"I was so excited to receive my new cookbook. Then I started reading and looking over the recipes. I thought this cookbook would list different types of traditional tamale receipes, not a bunch of fusion tamale receipes. I might try a few of the recipes, but I am definately not keeping this cookbook. It will be sold or regifted."
5,Great imitations,I'm a wedding planner/decorator and use these all the time when I want to add economical elegance to a dining experience. They're so much like the realthing. Hope they consider doing them in gold tone as well as the silver. They're resilient and affordable and can be tossed or recycled to use again. I highly recommend them for parties and wedding receptions.
2,Same old Rhetoric,"It would appear as though I am in the minority as the previous reviews all seem to tout this book as the go-to guide for for anyone with an interest in real estate investing. I have my doubts that Randel's sophisticated guide to making money in the real estate business will leave any serious Investor scratching his head asking ""Why didn't I think of that?"" For someone who is so internationally acclaimed I found it odd that in my 34+ years in the real estate business I have never once heard of him, but then I have never lectured at Harvard either.While I have no doubt there are a select few that may be able to glean some useful information from Randel's book, I'm afraid the ""Priceless Lessons"" that the book description provides are little more than common sense. Spend the extra 2 cents and pick up a copy of Real Estate Investing for Dummies."
1,Not suitable for children,"Our family has been delighted to view My Neighbor Totoro many times over the years. I purchased this video for my 8 year old son's Christmas stocking and was horrified to hear that the first word spoken was son of a b_____. Woman are referred to as ""broads"" and these are some of the less offensive utterings during this film. I found it neither entertaining nor suitable for a child 9, 10 or 12 for that matter.I am not a prude, but this film"
3,The Castle of Cagliostro,"I have been looking forward to the DVD release of this movie for some time. The original dubbed version on VHS was a treat and had a charm all of its own. However while the DVD release has the same animation, a redone script has been included. While the new script may be more faithful the the original Japanese version, I find the original dubbed script to be more entertaining. I would only buy this if you MUST have this on DVD as the new script changes the feel and atmosphere of the characters. A disapointment."
3,Hold On,This film seems to be a quickie made to cash in the `British Pop Invasion'.Harmless fun but not up to the quality of À Hard days Night' or `Help'. Songs are far better than the story but as a souvenir of this era it is worth adding to your library.The film is in 2.35:1 (correct format) not 1.77:1 in your product description.Transfer is very good and trailer is included.
2,A Must To Avoid Indeed,"About a dozen years ago PBS broadcast a British Invasion reunion special from some dreary hotel-casino in who-knows-where. Highlights included Eric Burdon without the Animals and the Foundations. It was Peter Noone going solo who brought down the house with a spine tingling rendition of ""There's a Kind of a Hush"". What does all this have to with ""Hold On!"" you may ask? Nothing but I thought I'd say something nice before I slammed this turkey. Noone and his mates are amicable geezers but that can't save this stink bomb. The story is pure bubble gum. It's as though it was written in crayon. The songs are mediocre save ""Leaning on a Lamp Post"". It's as though the film was shot quickly and haphazardly designed to cash in on the band's popularity before they fell out of favor. It should come as no surprise that this enterprise was produced by Sam Katzman, teen exploitation extraordinaire. Oh, well. Better luck next time, boys."
5,This Is NOT Duran Duran (Thank God),"While Andy Taylor was best known as the guitarist for Duran Duran, Thunder takes on a harder edge sound. I came across a single called ""When The Rain Comes Down"" from the Miami Vice II sound track that was just terrific. I bought the cassette ""Thunder"" in the 80's and played it until the writing on each side wore off.""Thunder"" was released before the age of the ridiculous Hair Band Heavy Metal Era (or whatever that particular time was called).Every song on the CD is solid, filled with creative guitar licks and satisfying lyrics.Much more than you would expect from Duran Duran...."
5,wonderful,"these are the coolest little bowls I've ever seen. I bought them for my mom for Christmas last year, and they are extrememly useful. I got them in tangerine, which is a very bright, sunny, orange color. We use them for everything from cereal to candy and nut dishes. I highly recommend these bowls."
1,Greeting Card Factory Deluxe V 6.0,"Buyer beware....if you have other Nova products such as Scrapbook Factory or an earlier version of this product, you cannot load it without taking out the other products. Tech support advised me that I needed to take out Scrapbook Factory. They didn't know if I would be able to re-load it????? Also, on the support website be wary if you go into msconfig to disable software if you are having a problem loading this program. This program has really created issues on my computer and I can't even use it, unless I want to remove Scrapbook Factory. As far as product review, I own the product but unfortunately can't use it!!"
3,Meguiar Bulk Quick Detailer,Thicker than the retail small size sold at auto supply store. Needed to be diluted so as not to clog the sprayer. But works well.
5,"Fun, fun, FUN!","Fun, Fun, FUN! As soon as this package arrived in the mail, it was ripped open and put in for play! Our family was highly impressed with the graphics, broad range of questions & topics for many age levels, easy use, and we found this game to be a-d-d-i-c-t-i-v-e!Not only does my entire family recommend this game, we highly suggest that you fill up your bowls full of popcorn or your favorite snack! Why? Because- Once you start playing this, you will not want to stop!"
2,A shop vac with a bag...,"Pros:1. Sucks up leaves and deposits them in a bag.2. Easy to put together.3. It's so small that the swath it cuts will make your neighbors laugh, which is said to add to good health.4. They hit the under-200 dollar market sweet-spot.Cons:1. Doesn't suck up anything else.2. Nozzle is small enough to make you wonder if you should bother getting it out of the garage or just get the rake and save your back and the electric bill.3. Motor is powerful enough to suck up leaves, but not powerful enough to suck up more than a few at a time. If several get stuck in the nozzle you'll spend more time picking them out and hand-feeding them back into the unit than you would had you just put them in the trash by hand.God bless them for trying, but this item is just a joke. It's better to spend 160 bux on a 20 gallon shop vac and just suck your leaves up with it instead of wasting your time and money on this offering."
3,Jeremy Sumpter Fans,"It is definitely a teenage chick flick, not a great storyline, quite predictable, but those girls who absolutely adore Jeremy Sumpter, will probably love it just because he's in it. :)"
5,Beautiful Boots,"People have been complimenting these boots, ever since I slipped them onto my lucky feet.They are very comfortable to wear and easy to put on with the side zipper.I like that fact that they are an updated partial lace up and the upper side buckles look great.If you are between sizes, go up not down, as they are a perfect fit."
4,Great book to start with,"I found it a great book to get acquainted with some british history, so I do not understand all the problems mentioned by other readers.The facts and the names seem all to be there, and it has some parts that explain the different part of society: economics, justice and so on in every period.My advice is to buy it and read it."
5,What a man,"What a life he went through. I only hope he is being looked after now & can still smile. He's been there, done that & I'm sure sold a few T-Shirts. A Truly amazing story & I'm sure Denzel Washington was knocked back as well. I can't wait to read Lazarus & the Hurricane. What could have been for Rubin was spoiled by some awful, awful people. I hope you can still smile Rubin !"
4,Brilliant and Touching,Obviously no one can write his story better than Rubin himself. This story is both and inspiring story of a man who has never stopped fighting and a terrifying reality check into the American judicial system. This book is filled with an anger that is only kept in check by the author's own love and compassion.The reader whould of course keep in mind this is an autobiography and therefore is skewed to the writer's point of view and emotional state.
2,Egregious proofing,"So, I have the HC of this book and am shocked by the sloppy proofing in this book right from the start. In the Preface, line 3, there is the number 2453 (instead of 1453) and I daresay this slip-up has been reproduced in the Paperback version as well. Then, grammar-wise, I caught the following right away. In the first page of the Introduction, ""to the two might civilizations"" must read ""to the two mighty civilizations"". Line 5 of Chapter 1, ""of stately and solemn ceremonial,"" must read ""of stately and solemn ceremonies,"".Anyway, a book this highly rated disappointed me right at the start and makes me wonder if there are idiots who are just paid to parrot praises at the Wall Street Journal and the likes, since they seem to have missed what a casual reader like me picked up. Makes me wonder what factual inaccuracies plague the book, but that is the subject of another review once I am done reading the book!"
4,An excellent sugar substitute with a low glycemic index.,"I bought this one and the dark variety. They are both very good; kind of a gentle sweetening agent, not in your face sweet like white sugar.I preferred the dark type as it seemed to have more flavor, but this one's taste is probably better for most baking recipes, as it would impart a less assertive note.No trouble using agave in all my recipes both sweet and savory, like that little bit of sweeteness one wants in a Thai dish, for example."
2,"OK - Good for encouragement, short on practical advice.","As a single father raising two children, I was looking for and expected a lot more specific and practical helpful advice. Its an easy read, but I estimate this book to be approximately 90% ""encouragement"".I think this is a book the author would have liked to have available when in this same circumstance, but it may be better categorized for most people as a 'spiritualistic' guide than a plain survival guide. Author does a good job covering the need to take care of yourself while taking care of a family and to get help when needed.I do NOT recommend it to men needing specific help with problems.I DO recommend it to men looking for encouragement and fundamental Christian Bible passages to help you through problems."
5,An excellent accordionist,"He is one of the best accordion players in the world. I, highly, recommend that people buy that compact disc."
1,Ye Olde Steaming Crocke,"Buyers beware! This book touts the long disproved belief that autism is an emotional disturbance, which is a crock. The interpretations have nothing to do with autism or the experiences of people with autism. Autism is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory processing and integration and affects communication. The condition varies among the indivuals who have it.Although interesting, do not, repeat, do not take this as gospel. It is rife with fallacies and the holes poked into the discredited misperceptions are big enough to drive fleets of trucks through. Read scholarly first person accounts such as the books by Edgar Schneider; Marc Fleisher; Temple Grandin and Donna Williams instead."
5,Major Improvement,"This album is way better than Billy Talent's first, This Suffering, Red Flag, and Where is The Line are the best songs."
3,Price is for one - not three like the picture,"I just received this item and thought, as the picture showed, there would be three - not one - so guess will not be able to share. Was hoping I could use two at a time on my back - keep pressure balanced on either side at the same time. Oh well. Have not had a chance to use it yet but looks promising."
5,This is a must read book!,"I have enjoyed reading Zoe Daniel's books for some time now, but the books that caught my interest was the year of the cat trilogy. It was well written and it kept m attention and I like that in a book. It is very rare for me to find a book that gets me involvesd with the characters. Daniels gave his character real characteristcs with out straying aeway from the interestin part of the story. I strongly suggest that everyone should read this book and continue by reading the last two books of the trilogy."
2,Entry Level,"I've given this book 2 star. 1 because it just is not overly useful & is quite prescriptive. The 2nd star because, the title is bang on - It really is UML book for Tech-oriented BA's.Given the content, this really could have been written with 1/10th of the content, paper & cost.This will have some value for tech-heads wanting to write ""something up"" in a structured (template-prescribed) manner, but if you have any remote BA experience you will not be satisfied will shelling out for this book. It seemed to have interesting self-bias that I couldn't put my finger. I tried using the format & approach in this book for role I had a few years ago that demanded exactly the approach outlined in this book. I spent more time of trying to extract the practicality of it, than I did in actually writing my spec... which was after realised I was wasting my time.Summary: Good to techies to entry level analysis only."
5,Neat Ideas,"At first I didn't enjoy the book. However, the more I read it the more I find neat little things (pearls!!?!). I find that I can dive in anywhere and just get lost there. I'm just a programmer and not a computer scientist. I very much appreciate the ideas I'm finding here."
4,Beautiful Shimmer,"This stuff leaves a golden shimmer that enhances a tan beautifully. I love that it has monoi oil in it also. I just wish that the sprayer continued to work beyond the first use. The 1st time I used it, it sprayed a fine mist that was perfect. Towards the end of that use, it quit working completely. I will try to find another bottle to transfer the product into as I love the product, just wish the product packaging worked as it was intended to."
3,Unexpected,"I picked up this book for the Medieval story not realizing it was a Romance novel. Overall it was well written - good plot, good character development (if you can get past the 'twas and other language that went against the tone of the book). I did find the word Vixen used in a Medieval book hard to swallow and the lack of barriers particularly for someone raped a little unbelievable. But I really enjoyed the interaction between the characters and the strength of woman's character."
5,Best wires for your car!,"These are great wires, OEM quality. I bought premium wires from Napa before and they did not work great, the ""premium"" quality was not there. These work great on my 2000 Saturn SL1. I wish I got them before the other ones. I have been using Denso wires for years on other cars and they have never disappointed me, always extremely happy with them."
5,Gift quality,I filled these with homemade goodies for Xmas and was quite pleased with the quality. The gifts were well received.
4,Outburst Bible Edition,I bought this for my brother and sister-in-law to start their own collection of crazy board games. :)
3,Small and lightweight mask,"I've written reviews on a number of these masks (read all my reviews to find them.) This one is good if you want something very small and lightweight. It doesn't do a good job of sealing out light, however. I improved mine by making a scissors cut halfway up the nose. This allowed the mask to separate a little and settle down onto my face, blocking out more light.Incidentally, this is exactly the same mask (except for color) as the 'Sweet Dreams' mask sold here. Pick the cheaper of the two."
3,Competent enough episode,"Le Carré chooses a context he worked in for years (British Public School) to solve a murder. The formula of a mildly quirky detective has become such a popular one - how many TV shows work this way? - and if you're after another workable episode, sure.I was more giving it a go having only read one other of his books: his poignant, dark and striking The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. George Smiley is a different bird entirely - not trying to soar or kick, just to entertain. Somehow I didn't find Smiley as engaging as I suspect I was supposed to, so I could take or leave it."
2,Labeling is wrong,"This is obviously a compilation of other recordings. I purchased it for someone else who was interested in one particular song. The quality of the recording is ok, but the list of songs and track numbers on the CD case doesn't match the way the songs appear on the CD. It makes it harder for someone to find the song she wants to play."
1,Don't get it,I do not understand all the adulation and high reviews this grill has received. My experience is that it cooks unevenly and is a nightmare to clean up.
1,Bland recipes...lots of them.,"I cooked about a dozen things from here and none of them were very good. The main reason was that they were all quite bland. This surprised me because I've done a good amount of Chinese, Thai, and Indian cooking and have three of Jaffrey's other cookbooks, all of which have a number of terrific and dynamic dishes. I suppose if I'd actually bought the book from a bookstore, rather than sight-unseen from Amazon, and really given it a good pre-purchse browsing, I might have held off purchasing it. I've cooked long enough and with enough variety to be able to read a recipe and have a good feel for how it will taste. While I've only cooked around a dozen of the recipes in the book, I've skimmed it cover to cover, and honestly, the things I cooked looked to be among the best recipes in the thing. Most of these recipes are just..meh..."
3,World Vegetarian,"A lot of recipes from her other books included here. I wanted new recipes , so a little disppointed in that ."
3,difficult to use,"My difficulty with this book is not in the recipes but in the organization of the recipes. This book is organized by ingredient, not by type of dish (appetizer, main course, side dish, dessert) or by country of origin. All recipes, wether Mexican appetizer, Persian side dish or Italian entree, are lumped together in the same chapter (if their main ingredient is the same).While I bought this book because I love ethnic cuisines, I cannot pick up this book and make a whole Indonesian or Mexican ( or any ethnic cuisine) dinner from it, the recipes aren't organized that way. Neither can I consult this book if, for instance, I need an Indian appetizer or a Spanish side dish (the dishes aren't labeled as such). If I happen to have a cabbage sitting around, and I don't care if I use it in a appetizer or main course, then this book is fine."
5,Worth every minute,As good as Season 1 and right up there with the best of British produced TV series. It spoils you for the drivel we endure with most of the U.S. series of this genre
2,Disappointing after watching the Swedish production,"We watched ""Faceless Killers"" last night. If I'd not seen the original Swedish Wallander, I might give this three stars. I was drawn into the characters, the relationships and Swedish culture much more in the original than in this BBC version. I couldn't wait to watch the next episode and I was never disappointed. The BBC version leaves me a bit flat and although I'll probably watch the next two, I could live without them too.If you like this one, I think you'll love the orginal series."
2,Histomap,"John Sparks's concept and depiction of the rise and fall of peoples and nations is brilliant. This particular offering is not the original Rand McNally version of the Histomap. Although the graphic representation is the same, the colors are not as vibrate and the document is not laminated. For the price, it should be both laminated and as brightly covered as the original."
3,Not a Map- Not what I expected,"This is not a map. I expected an actual map with points of History listed in the different geographical locations. Instead, this is a chart with the years and what happened. Granted, it is full of information, but with the ""HistoMap"" I actually expected a map. If you're looking for a map, keep looking. If you're looking for a chart, this is it."
3,All the hits.. but not the originals!,"This reworking of the brothers Tavares Greatest Hits collection is pretty complete subtracting Free Ride(a remake of Edgar Winter's hit wich became a minor hit for Tavares). They added a few new tracks that were hits for other artists Like Imagination's disco hit Just An Illusion and Leo Sayer's When I Need You. The bonus here is the inclusion of their last ""Quiet Storm"" early 80's hit A Penny For Your Thoughts. But as I said, none of these are the original versions! Penny's original version is hard to get these days!"
3,Stiff wires...,I only gave this item 3 stars because the wires were so stiff. I'm not going to cut into them to find out but they feel like solid core wires rather than woven wire. On the other hand the alligator clips seem to be fairly high quality as the teeth all match properly and the spring seems solid and the plastic covers are adequate. The banana plugs work fine too. It's just the type of wire they used that I'm disappointed in.
4,Just what I needed,"I don't understand why meters don't come with these. It seems like every time I use my meter I need a way to clip the leads to what I am testing. THese work great on my Sperry, Fluke meters. A great addition to any meter. Pretty standard fitting."
2,ok not great,I wasn't real excited about this book after I got into it. It was good but nothing special.The story takes place in 999 just before the turn of the millennium. In other words Y1k. There are all the doomsday believers who think that the world will end with the coming year. There are also those who believe that the new century is a time for new beginnings. Rafael Leonhart is one of those people. He is apart of a leggend that states that the land of Alderich will change hands and no longer belong to the Rune. So to help insure that this does happen Rafael takes Serath Rune hostage. She is the granddaughter of the Ruling Rune. The only problem is that Serath's grandfather has no love for her at all. This puts a crimp in Rafael's plans but what effects those plans even more is his growing attraction and feelings for his hostage. She is feared by many but he knows that she is not what she appears to be.It was a good book not a great one but a good one.
2,a total rip for the price,"the mold of the Jason head looks great, the rest is garbage. the covering mask is cheap super thin plastic that doesn't even fit to the mask underneath it. the hair is stuck on the head with ugly looking blobs from a glue gun. I ended up just using the head as a decoration instead of a costume part. Over all this is just poorly made junk."
4,Good escapist swords and sorcery fantasy,"This third volume in the Eternal Champion cycle is a nice escapist swords and sorcery plot set in a distant-future-post-apocalyptic Europe which is slowly being taken over by the Dark Empire of Granbretan. There is plenty of over-the-top swordsmanship and heavy use of Deus Ex Machina, but within Moorcock's framework of the eternal champion and the cosmic balance/runestaff I think it works. The narration was for the most part less cynical and preachy in this storyline than in the first two Eternal Champion volumes, which for me made the reading experience more enjoyable."
5,Good reference,"If you are curious about the Jehovahs Witnesses and their beliefs, this is a handy little book to pick up. It's plainly written an easy to understand about their fundemental beliefs."
1,watchtower jehovah witnesses,from what i have been toldall material from the watchtower or jehovah witnesses organization are not to be soldthey put this in (almost) every one of their materialsthe materials are all freeand can be found as amongst other PDF on their respective websites (e.g. [...])
4,Slicer knife,"The slicer is good quality and balanced. I would have preferred a little more weight and a little different edge, but am satisfied."
2,to hard to play,"i am 31 I can't figure it out, none of my friends or family members could either. this game isn't very good.. don't waste your money.. your choice really"
4,Gin Rummy Game,"This gin rummy game is fun and convenient to take on trips to keep kids entertained, and also to teach them how to play the game with a deck of cards."
1,Frontier Quick Draw Electronic Target Shooting Set,"While this toy looks great fun to play with it has many faulty issues, you shoot and nothing happens, they have to engineer this toy a tad better."
3,You aim BELOW the cans..,"The cans sit on a plastic log that has little slits under each can. You have to aim at the SLIT, not the can, which makes it pretty hard to hit. The boys seem to like it anyway...It's a simple set-up, and can easily go from room to room. I would probably buy it again."
4,"Sure, They're Fine","The trick here is that you couldn't put them together for the price, so they're fine.There's been a design change, apparently. The meter-end banana plug connectors are no longer piggyback-style. There is a hole in them that will accept another banana plug, but modern meter lead plugs/jacks are shrouded, so you can't piggyback anyway.The banana plugs are an open split style, so they can be squeezed down or pried open to fit nearly any meter jack. It's probably best to do this gradually, 2 or 3 small adjustments are better than one large.The banana plug wire end is screw clamped, easily repaired. The alligator clip end is crimped, repair would need soldering.The whole assembly is perfectly fine, but it's not robust. Maybe better suited to bench work than field work. One reviewer noted that the alligator clamp jaws soon lose alignment. Yep, that's what happens with these small alligator clamps. The big ones too, as far as I know."
5,No Problems.,They work well and are durable. An easy five stars.*The Alligator clips were a bit strong. hopefully the springs will loosen up a bit after use.
1,This book offers nothing!,From whichever perspective you look at it - this books offers absolutely nothing. I wish I could get my $$ back!
3,Inexpensive Shower Arm,"What you pay is what you get. Flimsy arm due to thin metal. Shallow threads do not give you the impression or confidence of a quality product. For the cheap price (at fraction of Grohe, Hansgrohe or Kohler), that's all you can expect. Not designed to get on/off multiple times; otherwise it looks good and hopefully it will last for awhile even it is on the filmsy side.BTW, make sure not to over torque or bump it. It will twist out of shape easily. I learned the hardway. Just use lots of teflon tape for alignment (trial and error)."
5,Still fun after all these years.,"It's fun, it's silly; it's a heartfelt homage to 50's creature features that works well. I've watched it a few times over the years and it remains a fun distraction."
2,"Rent it, don't buy it.","I paid 99 cents to rent this movie. If I had paid more for it I would have been extremly upset. It was a cute movie to rent, but I wouldn't recommend buying it."
1,Bad movie,"Watching this movie I realize they producers didn't took it for seriously. And when people stay in the shopping mall to protect of the spiders, that idea reminded me ""Dawn of the dead"", of George A. Romero. It's the same idea. Bad acting and bad script. Don't waste time."
3,The spiders made it a cute movie.,"I had very low expectations when I watched this movie for the first time, clearly expecting the worst. To my surprise it was actually quite entertaining. The overall plot was quite cheesy but they did a good job with the spiders. Though if your expecting realistic spiders.... ummm let me put it this way... I distinctly heard one of the spiders say ""Woohoo party"" when they were stampeding through the mines chasing townfolk.The movie is good for a laugh."
4,lol,"The title of this movie says it all. it's supposed to be horror, and huge spiders certainly are creepy as all get-out, but this movie has a lighter note than the likes of 'Arachnophobia' and can be really funny in some parts - it's campy horror that's really entertaining."
5,cool movie,i saw this movie it was real cool it had action and thrills i think it was entertaining one of the best spider movies i seen thats my views on this movie thanks.
1,Beware of Bluray sets having problems.,"There's a lot of people out there having issues with these Bluray sets. A lot of people have missing discs, others (like myself) have all the discs, but the Blurays won't play. In my set it's disc 3 that won't play. Excellent show, but this is a place to rate these specific sets and my opinion is if you're thinking of buying them, wait... there's too many problems with them now. EDIT: It seems my disc 5 won't play either. Discs 1 ,2 and 4 play fine, discs 3 and 5 don't play at all. New Sony Bluray playerwith the latest firmware updates and still won;t play those specific discs."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Don't do it! I was not paying attention and thought that this was the 1st episode and what I got was 7 minutes of ""what I loved the most about this set was..."". This is not worth 2 bucks. You'd be better off buying a cup of coffee for your coworker or something like that."
1,i would have loved it ..but,i never recived it not sure what happened pre-ordered but it never showed up i am not sure if it was ever released
1,Missing Disc 3!,"I pre-ordered the item from amazon (who as far as I can tell did a wonderful job), and selected the fastest shipping so that I would receive the product on the release date 2/19. I opened the new sealed disc set, and disc 3 of the blu-ray was not there! This has never happened to me before. The packing leaflets were also bent, and the DVD's were visibly dirty. I have no idea what happened. HBO or whoever takes care of their packaging their box sets completely messed this one up.As for the show, I haven't seen it yet, but I have read the books, and loved them. I won't watch the show until I get the complete box set that I paid for."
1,Blu-ray did not play,"Blu-ray version would not play. The specific error is, ""This Disc can not be played."" Other Blu-ray movies play just fine but not GoTs2. Problem with the DRM? My Blu-ray player is from 2010. Maybe it requires an update but I don't have the motivation so I returned this Blu-ray boxset.Long story short: open the cardboard shipping box in a way that you can reuse it in case you find yourself returning the boxset"
3,Biggest Fan but Incredibly Disappointed,"I am a HUGE fan of the first season of Game of Thrones, as well as the entire book series. I waited almost 2 years to order this as I no longer got HBO. I have watched season one at least, and not kidding, 50 times since I bought it. I recommend it to EVERYONE, gushing about the amazing story lines and characters and the genius of George R R Martin as a writer.HOWEVER, season 2 SUCKED. Not nearly the depth of the first season, and even the actors that stayed are not as true to life. The story line is choppy, with soooo many IMPORTANT scenes missing from the books as well as adding long, boring scenes that weren't in them and make no lasting impression. Leaving out important secondary characters and missing whole scenes that I feel were necessary to the the tale was a mistake. That kept this season from being as full and rich and complete as the first.Sorely disappointed. If I could send a movie back because I didn't like it, I would."
5,blu ray GOT season 2,the number of digital options besides uv was nice. the blue ray and quality of the series speak for themselves.
3,Ok To Spend some extra time. Soft porn is ok needs better Plot.,"The Series, is OK to spend some extra time! the Soft Porn is a mixture of sadism and masochism what ever happened to just good old fashion sex?I do enjoy that the show has a few great actors Peter Dinklage for one does a great Job.King Of Thrones is OK for Adults! The plot needs to be better and Sex is good but Sex is sex stop mixing it with Violence no reason too really. Then let the Kings Wench with good looking wenches and the battle fields be bloody.IMHO"
5,Drool,Great book series & the did an awsome job on the TV series. I cut my cable so I was thrill to get this super cheap. Can't wait till it arrives.
5,Love It!,"I love this series. Well written, excellent acting and directing, interesting story lines, lots of action. Great show. Can't wait for season 3."
3,Guide to Wyoming Fishing,Book was delivered on time and in good shape. The book was a recommendation form another site and it does have relevant information in it although the information is basic and not very in depth but for obtaining basic information on new areas to fish it is sufficient.
1,So Many Characters,So many characters - so little action - find a better way to spend your book dollars. This trilogy uses many pages to say nothing and what is said is so confusing that it is more a puzzle than a novel.
4,So you tried Game of Thrones and were a little disappointed?,"That was my reaction but I liked the story just well enough to pick up the second one.So glad that I did. The story becomes much more action packed, fast paced and full of surprises. The first book developed the characters for us and this one really gets into the story at a fast pace.The element of surprise is used well in this book and this is a massive improvement over the 1st book in many ways.Martin still has the issue with throwing in too many minor characters and muddling the book up with names that make it a bit confusing in parts.Overall though excellent writing. On to Storm of Swords."
5,This Book Was Great!!,I loved this book. George R. R. Martin is a wonderful writerand I have enjoyed both his books. This one was even better than thelast book. It was interesting and kept me reading until the end.
5,A Must Read for Fantasy Fanatics,"Both books are absolutely wonderful pieces of work. Great blend of plot and action, without a whole lot of phoney baloney magic. The lack of easily identifiable villains and heros makes this series even more enjoyable to read than Jordan and Goodkind. It is my greatest hope that Martin takes some cues from Feist and wraps this series up within the next 1 or 2 volumes. No fan of fantasy needs to pick up another unfinished 10 volume saga. Keep up the good work Mr. Martin!"
3,Deciding whether to buy the 3rd book or not.,"Not as fresh as the first book. Less interesting characters, more words spent describing wardrobe than personality. Within the plot itself, too much ""deux ex machina"". Still, two books into it, I will end up buying the next one... guess that is how series work."
2,A Clash of Kings,Great book but not what i thought i ordered. I ended up paying more for the book than i would in the store. I tried to get help from bookworm but they never followed up. I will not order from them again!
3,Disappointment...,"The first book was probably the most enjoyable fantasy/fiction story I have ever read. The sequel, however, is not of the same quality. While the characters were interesting previously, they now often act with little intelligence. As for the 'brutalization of women', the reader needs to remember that women in these environments WERE treated in this manner. The authors treatment is not excessive but realistic. Pretending it did not happen won't change the past, unfortunately."
4,Great book,"Just slightly less compelling than the first book. Great characters, complex story, and Tyrion is absolutely fantastic in this book. Highly recommended."
5,What A Ride!,This second book was just as good as the first! New character point of views make it a bit different. The story continues perfectly.
5,So addicting it's sick!,"So addicting it's sick! This really does sum it up. All I've read so far, and currently read, are amazing. Just when you think you know where it's going the rug is ripped right out from under you, time and time again.I only hope my own books develop into something so great.Shelia WeissAuthor of The Hunted[...]"
3,A Clash of Kings: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two,"A rich story with intriguing characters. Sometimes hard to follow because of the number of characters introduced, but hard to put down because of the intricate plot."
4,One Step Down,"Slight slippage, perhaps a matter of sophomore success, perhaps of alliance with television. Still, the first book was real; the second slides into magic. I'm now reading the third, and it is weak. More to go, and never read a review without understanding the reviewer. To now, though, a good start seems to be fading."
4,"Characters, more characters and a gripping tale","The strength of this second book is in the way a varied cast of characters is woven into a well told tale, and could justify 4.5 stars. As with the first book, the writing is a bit uneven, but the story engine keeps on keeping on, and I frankly didn't care all that much. If I want deep literary value I'll go read Faulkner. I agree with other reviewers who mentioned Tyrion as a favorite character, and who is a good example of Martin's remarkable talent for creating characters who are appealing and in a peculiar way, realistic for a fantasy novel."
4,"Good read, but a bit slower than Book 1","It was good, yes. Good in the manner that GRRM makes everything he touches into an epic saga of love, war, and grim circumstances. This novel was somewhat slower than the first volume; it covers a lot more politics. We are allowed a more intimate view of serveral characters (refreshingly, not all the perspectives are reprisals of the first novel), but some of it seems rather dry and forced.If you enjoyed the first novel, DO read this one, too. It's worth the hours (and hours and hours) you'll invest in it... to get to the next book, in which the storyline picks up considerably."
3,Way too much death and a very grim book,"This book is the second in the Song of Ice and Fire series.My hubby enjoyed the first book.He asked for the second one, and I delivered it to his majesty.Unfortunately, according to him, it was just way over the topwith death and violence for him.A very heavy book that left him feeling very somber and downhearted.Having warned him about the pros and cons of this book.....he got what he asked for.I realize just about everyone enjoyed this book.Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.My hubby says right now, he needs a little lighter book.I am getting him part three of ""The Golden Compass""called ""The Amber Spyglass"".To those who can't take an honest review-raspberries to you all!!Little babies!"
3,Clash of Kings,All fine. I just didn't realise that the book came without a dust cover. Not a problem as such but I cant remember it being mentioned in the item description.
2,Totally Confused,"After watching the HBO series I bought this book because I couldn't wait. I've found some things similar, but some things are confusing, which has left me totally confused."
4,A very good read!,"I am an avid fantasy/scifi reader, and I am very impressed with this book. I tore through it like the pages were on fire. Although Martin's book is fantasy, it contains traces of historical references (the deposed family remided me an awful lot of the British Stuarts...) The characters were deep, and the story was very good. My favorite fantasy writers are Margret Weiss and Tracy Hickman of 'Dragonlance' fame, and Glen Cook, author of the ""Black Company"" series. I did not ever think that a series would top either one of these, but if Martin keeps up at hsi current skills, I will be wrong!"
4,Couldn't Put it Down,"Book two of The Song of Fire & Ice picks up where the first book stops; Westeros is not the same place anymore. Both the King and his hand have been killed, and several people proclaim themselves as Kings. Fighting erupts amongst the warring sides, and the story continues with different characters' perspectives shedding light on the many events that happen.After the first book ended, I thought, well I will NOT get attached to any characters, since everyone seems to get killed! I hope though, that Arya Stark and Jon Snow will not meet their end in this series. This was such a fast paced book, utterly gripping - I'm actually reading the fourth now, but am behind with my reviews."
4,A Clash Of Kings,Good ........what it says on the tin............and they will not let me be monosyllabic and submit so I have to write rubbish before I press the submit button!
2,Poor execution,"I'm sorry to say that I'm less than satisfied - the story is fine (so far), but the book itself leaves much to be desired (especially for such an expensive paperback). The paper is only a step above newsprint, there were pre-production top-to-bottom creases in many of the pages that disrupted the printing (and now break up the text on both sides), and the size of the type varies from line to line (this may not change the story, but it can be distracting). If/when I purchase the third installment, I'll definitely be looking for a different publisher."
2,"Slow paced, picks up at the end","The second instalment of A Song of Ice and Fire is much slower paced than the first book. The story plods along with very little action and little progression in the story. The only two character stories that held my attention was that of Tyrion and Arya. Both these characters had meaningful story lines and their chapters were a welcome respite from the mundane lives of the other inhabitants. Jon Snow also had a very interesting chapters but sadly there were too few of those. After slogging through three-quarters of the book, suddenly the action picks up and the entire story becomes lively and interesting, finally climaxing with the long awaited battles, whose preparations comprised the bulk of the first 75% of the book. The final quarter is an absorbing read, reminiscent of the first book. I will continue reading the saga and hope the remainder is more in the vein of a Game of Thrones than a Clash of Kings which was tedious to say the least."
4,A Clash Of Kings Preview,"I saw Martin speak at the Worldcon in early August. He said that the pub date for the Harper CollinsUK edition was November of this year, and in January 99 from Bantam US. So I have to wonder if this pub date is correct, or did Bantam move it back? Either way, this second novel is well worth the wait! There is also a new novella, called The Hedge Knight"", set 100 years before AGoT, that is being published in the new anthology ""Legends"" from Tor. I've heard some of ACoK read by Martin, and it's full of beautiful writing and compelling characters, and a story that turns and twists and excites the imagination."
4,A lot of story building,"A few heavy parts in this book, an epic climatic battle, (that was poorly done on HBO compared to the book) and a lot of story & character building. I enjoyed it because it sets up storm of swords very well."
5,A rich story,"The author paints a good picture. I could easily see all of it happening in my mind, similar to the Wheel of Time, but darker."
4,Satisfied,The product came exactly as expecting. I am completely satisfied with this purchase. Well worth the price I paid for it
2,boring with moments of brilliance,"I have a few friends, the opinions of which I value, who really like these books, which is why I waded through the second. However, I found it rather like the first: too dark, way too many characters, and kind of boring, interspersed with scenes of riveting brilliance. I'm glad there is a TV show. I do not plan to keep reading this series."
3,A Solid Read,"An exciting follow up that shows real promise of blooming into a great fantasy series. The plot moves along at a steady clip, but doesn't skip any of the in-depth character development that we saw in the first book. The book is a clasic tale of war and intrigue between kings. This series shows real promise of a great story.The books only major downfall is it's very crude and gratuitous look at sexuality. Although, it adds a little realism it isn't neccessary that is why it's called fantasy. Most of the adult insights are as important and deep as the shower scene in the Porky's movie."
3,Stopped reading at the end of book 2,"Got drawn in to read the books from the TV series, but really found it too slow almost like reading about the politics of a fantasy realm, also very violent. Interesting to a point, but not enough to keep reading."
4,Still a Strong Series,"The second installment shows the first signs of sprawl. A lot is happening and there seem to be major players who needed more introduction while some plot points seem extraneous. Just when you start to enjoy one point of view, the chapter ends and you're on to something that you don't care about. Then you cycle through a bunch of characters before hopefully returning to a favorite only to be pulled away again. It's a hallmark of this series that at times annoys and at times works really well.The overall story though is strong enough to keep you going."
2,Soap Opera,"I enjoyed the first book, well written with a lot of action and interesting characters. The second book opens to so many characters (and each chapter goes from character to character) and so many story views I found it frustrating. While he can write, I only got 3/4 of the way through this book, to much a soap opera, too many characters lines, and frankly too slow to endure."
4,Overall very well done,"I picked up the first of this series of books directly after finishing Tolkiens immortal trilogy as well as the Silmarillion. I was hoping to find something as engrossing and exciting as Tolkien's masterpiece but unfortunately I was dissapointed. However, I did persevere and finished the first, and now I am glad to say after having finishing the second that it was well worth the time spent and I can't wait for the third to come out on paperback (so I'm cheap). Mr. Martin paints an extremely elaborate picture that I feel could occupy atleast 5 more books, and to that I say ""Bring 'em on"". Though he does get a little caught up in the details (does he love food or what?), overall the books are very entertaining and worth the time spent reading their 800+ pages. They may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy good fantasy you may want to pick these books up."
4,A Solid Second Part,"A Clash of Kings picks up where a Game of Thrones left off. If you really enjoyed the first book in the series, then you should by all means continue to the second. If you did not enjoy the first one, you shouldn't expect the second to be any different.Okay, that being said, Martin begins to create the framework for where he wants the rest of the series to go in A Clash of Kings. There is plenty of action, but there is also a lot of important plot development that will eventually pay off (if not in this book then in one of the later ones)."
5,Great book!,I very much enjoyed this! I am loving Roy Dotrice's voices. He keeps me engaged. This has been great for my commute!
2,not the same as the original :[,"I bought this DVD thinking it would be the same material as my sister and i watched back in the 90's. Yes, some stories/ songs are the same (If Moon Was Cookie, Counting Sheep, Dancing to Sleep) but my favorites are missing! There's no more King Puppet with ""I Have A Problem"" where his crown falls under his bed and only the littlest girl can reach it, and the ""Everybody Sleeps"" song is way different too; why change a good thing? beats me. this new one is a downgrade and although it's still cute to watch with my boyfriend as we fall asleep, I miss the good old video I used to watch. I guess i'll have to break out the VCR to see that one.."
3,Useful... but not without flaws,"I'll start by saying that I've never used the magnifying glass on this third hand tool. I don't use this guy much unless I need to tension or hold wires for soldering. It's useful, but it still has some major flaws.For one thing, it's base (or at least the base on my unit) is not completely flat, so it rocks around on my table. Also, I find the little alligator clips at the end keep coming off, although I can easily remedy this by pushing them back in and tightening them. The whole arm is also a little stiffer than I would like it to be, and not very flexible either. And of course, I found a similar model to this (made by Velleman) at my local Fry's Electronics for $5."
2,"seems solid, but overall unimpressive","I got this to make soldering easier, and while it helps, there's still room for improvementThe base is neither wide enough nor heavy enough, as the unit keeps falling over.The magnifying glass had some scratches on the lens when I received the product, they're small and don't really get in the way, but I think it's unacceptable to ship a product in that condition.the joints come loose very quickly after I tighten themIf you want a cheap magnifier/holder get this, but don't expect it to be perfect."
3,This is XACTO?,"I'm just gonna sum it up real quick.. I've used Xacto knives for years, they are great.. well depending on which one you get. Thinking Xacto as name brand I went ahead and purchased this tool from Amazon.com. Was not expecting a whole lot, but as far as this goes.. no Xacto logo, the coating on the base is pretty crappy and the cheap alligator clips are the worst. They are made from thin steel, they barely hold anything and always get loose. I mean I could of got the same thing of eb y from china and even save a few bucks.. but thought by getting Xacto I would be getting a bit more.. that is no longer the case. Xacto is by far not what it was 10 years ago."
3,Good for the price - sensitivity could be better,"I use headphones for workouts and tend to go through them. For the price, these have very good sound and sturdy construction. My only issue is their less than great sensitivity. That is, my MP3 player, which runs eight hours with sensitive headphones, has its battery drain in about four hours with these. And I need to max out the player volume control sometimes."
2,Has not improved with age,"Granted ""Killer's Payoff"" was written nearly 45 years ago, but even forgetting the goofy then-hip dialog and arcane police proceedures, this is still not among the better 87th Precinct novels. The story is fairly mundane for the series and features Detective Cotton Hawes out on a libido rampage. This is obnoxios enough in and of itself, but at the end, McBain uses the old ""talking killer"" cliche, only here he multiplies it by three. Bottom line is that these novels are better the more plausile they are. This one contains enough implausibilities to make it hardly worthwhile."
4,Life of Apartheid,"This collection of short stories tells about the pain of living under the system of apartheid, from all points of view. Some of these stories are about black people who have to live as inferiors for their entire lives, while others are about white people who realize what kind of system this really is. No matter what side the speaker of the story is on, all of the stories tell of realization and pain and they exhibit over and over again what a bad way to live apartheid was.I liked that each story was slightly different--some were about the rich, others about the poor, and every author had a different theme and a different purpose. I didn't feel like I was reading the same thing over and over. I tend to not like short stories, though, because they don't have the time to develop the characters to the extent I'd like. I'm always left wondering what happened to the characters after each story ends."

2,"Well drawn, but not my thing","The subject matter isn't nearly as varied as the Amazon review suggests; the majority of it is vampires and vampire-related activities. It is very well drawn, though. Bottom line, I tore out 4 pictures that I thought were especially sexy or good for art reference and threw away the rest.If you like vampires, this book is for you."
3,"Easy to read, but it compromises the text in some areas","The New Living Translation of the Bible is loved by many for its readability, yet it does have it's problems. While it is more faithful to the text than its predecessor, there are areas where the translators speculate regarding the true text. This is fine on occasion, but there are areas where the NLT actually stretches the text. For instance, in the narrative of Jacob and Leah, Leah's biggest fault was that she had ""pretty eyes."" While the meaning of this phrase is difficult in Hebrew, the meaning is clearly NOT the one set forth in the NLT. On the whole, it tends to be faithful to the Greek and Hebrew while being easy to read. Would recommend this for those unfamiliar with the Bible."
1,Holy Bible: New Living Translation (maybe),The book has been on order now for over one month and I just received an up-date that it will take again over another month before I might receive it. So I really can not review the book. But I would like to add that I probably could have hand printeda Bible by the time they will send it to me. I will not use a four letter word here because I don't want the sky to cloud up as I would like to live at least a few more years.
3,So-So translation,"After reviewing what I consider more accurate, mainstream bibles like the NAB and the NJB (both Catholic though I am not), I have to say I am somewhat disappointed in the New Living Translation. In some areas it doesn't really deserve to be called a ""translation"" but rather, ""a paraphrase.""It's good point is that it is easy to read and it's wording in a few places are beneficial. However, if you are looking for a translation that sticks as close to the original Hebrew/Greek text as possible, this is not it. I do keep it around for reference but when I want to be confident about what the original manuscripts actually say, you won't catch me pulling this one out."
1,This book is nothing but fluff!,"There is very little new or useful information in this book other than an explanation of why calcium is thought to be important for weight loss. You could get the same information by just reading a milk carton! The tone of the book reads as though it was written for 3rd graders... nice title though, it suckered me!"
2,"PROVOCATIVE TITLE, NOT MUCH ELSE","This is a BOOK review, not my political stance. My intent is to help potential buyers decide if this book is worth their time/money.Ian Wright's detour into political polemics (he is a children's book writer in general) is quite endearing but unfortunately a little sentimentalistic and egregiously one-sided. The title, which is what made me spend on this book, is pretty much the only enticing thing you'll find here. I wonder if Wright was trying to pull off a Michael Moore effort?I have nothing againts cavillars, indeed it is even interesting at times to read highly opinionated counter-intuitive takes on matters that impact the world, not just US. But if you are serious about pithy issues such as the propriety of war and its modes, you may be better off with the well-researched tomes of Bob Kagan, Noam Chomsky, or Farid Zakaria."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,This book did not cover enough topics.It seemed to be restricted to the point where it seemed to be written in A OLD FASHIONED WAY THAT it over looked today problems.
4,Getting better!,"When I read The Green Rider I was rather disappointed, the book was too long and not really interesting and I had the impression I had already read it before. Several times. I skipped large parts of it and still managed not to lose any of the storyline. It's not that the book was awfully bad, it's just that it wasn't really interesting for the most part. Until the end that is.It's like writers get paid by the page or something, more and more of them seem to be writing huge books about nothing these days.So I picked up the sequel and started reading not expecting much.Who could've known this is a series in which the second part is better than the first?? That sort of thing happens almost never.Suddenly the story is original and interesting and dinamic and there's a development in the relationship between Karigan and the king. It was really titillating. Mentally I mean :-)Can't wait for the third part. I hope the trend of getting better continues."
4,Good addition to the game,this expansion is a good addition to the Catan game. It adds a useful element of depth and strategy that was previously missing.
3,JH,"The River tile ads another dimension to any of the Settlers of Catan games. We have only used it a few times, but find it to make the original games more exciting."
5,The management book.,"If you don't manage with respect to systems, variation, theory or psychology than you are not managing. Dr. Deming shows the way in a challenging manner."
5,"A must read for anyone who thinks about productivity or ""life-hacking""","This book is the absolute classic on normalizing and then improving the systems one works with or manages.It is written in a rather particular style that takes a hundred pages or so to get used to, but then it becomes endearing and memorable.The only frustration with the book is, having worked in industry, there are a lot of times I have heard someone reference ""quality control"" or ""quality management"" or even some of the specific terms in the book, but few people have actually read or understood it. Its terminology has entered the buzzword-o-sphere, but its ideas have not.Also, there are some ideas it contains that are vaguely dehumanizing and anti-environmental (though to be fair, the author is at those points criticizing the lack of systematic sensibility in most pro-human pro-environment government programs - he is anti-regulation in part because regulatory bodies are usually themselves irregularly run, funded, or enforced.)"
5,Masterful,"This is greek music at its peak. No other greek artist performs, sings, creates, and expresses the greek spirit like George Dalaras. He is a national treasure. His pathos, and genuine flow of talent is definetly exhibited in this wonderful cd."
1,Terrible quality,"A word of advice, STAY AWAY from this DVD for the quality is so poor it's not even worth watching if they gave it way for free. Hopefully someone will remaster this wonderful version of Dickens adaptation of Nicholas Nickleby. Until then, I give this DVD a zero rating."
1,Nicholas Nickelby rating,"Quality of DVD was poor.....when we got through two thirds of the picture it was scrambled...it subsequently corrected itself but we lost the continuity of the story. Please replace DVD. I have already requested a replacement and have not heard anything. Thank you, Suzette Sullivan"
2,Poor Editing,"The movie is very good and the acting excellent. However, this is the most poorly edited film I've seen. Sequences have been cut wholesale, for seemingly no good reason, which make much of the story unintelligible. Don't buy this version."
2,Not the best - sorry,"Well, fellow UFOers, this isn't a great book, unfortunately. Although there was a lot of information in it, the book jumped around a lot making it hard to follow. On the other hand, I did learn a few new things, so I'll call it ""worth the price I paid"" but I wouldn't recommend it. I would say that it might be good for someone just getting into UFOlogy, to learn some basics, some old news about Roswell (I guess it's all old news about now, isn't it :)If it were better written and stayed on topic from paragraph to paragraph it could be good, but it doesn't do that. Most of the pictures were hard to see, too.Certainly isn't Amazon's fault, though."
3,some questionable words used,"Be aware that this book uses the word 'hate' a few times and also refers to Mrs. Wishy Washy as 'mean' old lady...its a good fun story, and I still read it to my daughter, but I edit the choices of words along the way...she has the rest of her life to find out what hate is...a two year old doesn't need to know now."
5,Among the most profound and moving in the language,"This selection of the most important of Donne's poems complemented by critical articles that provide insight into the techniques and meanings of one of the most intellectually challenging of the great English poets is first -rate.Donne's greatness as a poet is in part in his making passionate argument of ideas, in his fusing the world of sense and idea in startling combinations. His poems of Love and of Death are among the most profound and moving in the language."
2,Poor Editing or Poor Editorial Choices,"""Donald Dickson's John Donne's Poetry is the best text of Donne now available. It is scrupulously edited, and equally useful for students and for scholars."" --Harold BloomHarold Bloom is wrong. Period.If you, as a reader, value Donne's own editorial punctuation - his indications as to how the meter of the poem should be read - don't buy this book. Dickson is inconsistent. He notes some of Donne's indications while he ignores others. What's worse, he gives the reader no indication that he is doing so. I strongly recommend Patride's edition of Donne's Complete English Poems. For a clear discussion of this, feel free to check out my post on ""Batter my Heart"" at my blog ""PoemShape"".You will also find a link to Patride's edition (also at Amazon)."
2,Not impressed,"think product is old, light splotchy spots on all pictures. would not recommend purchase of this product due to result."
1,one of two Cartridges did not work,"Unfortunately, one of the two cartridges did not work as the printer did not recognize it as having toner or ink. An error message was generated that a new cartridge was required. My opinion is that the cartridge was old and dried out. Wasted the cost of two cartridges."
2,kodak ph40,printed about 10 to 15 photos with both cartridges and they both went dry.Its no wonder why this product is hard to find
1,Not enough cartridge ink for the number of pages,"It is very disappointing to have 40 pages of paper and only be able to print a little over half that number with the cartridge that comes with it. I now have three unopened packages of paper that I have no cartridge for. I think we should be able to buy just the cartridge when we need to. It sure would be nice. That is why I am only rating one star. Otherwise, it would have been a five.... Thanks, Marsha"
1,Less than expected,Unfortunately the ink in this package ran out very early. After speaking with Kodak I learned that this is a normal occurrence and they don't guarantee that you will get to use all of the photo paper.

1,"Series: 5 stars, Paramount Studios: ZERO STARS!!!!!!","After purchasing ALL NINE SEASONS of this set separately, I am very disappointed that Paramount would do this. You mean that just to get the extras disc, I have to spend HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS MORE?? I just have two words for Paramount: NO WAY!!!! Most true MI Fans will already have the series, and that is just too much to spend to ""double dip"". If you are a big fan, and have not yet purchased the series, I would say buy each season separately. you'll save a whole lot of cash! Not worth it just for the extra DVD and fancy packaging! SHAME ON YOU PARAMOUNT!!!!"
5,Mission Imposible,"This is a very good show, team work, planing a execution great, unfortunaly the new version of Mission Impossible (Tom Cruise) is a Bat copy of James Bond."
5,Explosive Package!!! Must Buy!!!,"This package is WAY COOL and a great tribute to the epic series that started it all! I grew up watching this show with my Dad and have been looking to get all the seasons in one box and here it is. The package quality is high end, the episodes are remastered, and well worth the money. A must buy for any M:I fan!!!"
4,The Acid - Alkaline Diet,I am a true believer in balancing your health and restoring the pH levels in the body. This book is easy to read and gives a good understanding of the importance of creating homeostasis for the body to function at optimum levels.
1,How does he know that,"The author makes a lot of clear statements about what is acidifying and what is alkalizing. However, some of what he says is the exact opposite of other sources of information I've found. Unlike the other sources, Vasey never ever (as far as I could tell) explained how he knew what he said was true. He never mentioned doing any testing on the foods (as far as I could tell). He never mentioned any sources of his information. We are just suppose to assume he is a font of all wisdom on this subject for no reason that I could understand. I believe it was Bertrand Russell who said that insight untested is no guarantee of the truth. As he never explained his source of knowledge on this, I don't trust him."
4,Easy to use...,"Adobe Photoshop took me a while to get used to when I first got it, but learning to use Premiere was a lot easier though I'm still learning. I would use it more often if it didn't take up so much RAM. After I upgraded my OS to Windows XP, I've used Windows Movie Maker for my basic video editing needs. Recommended only if you're in need of professionalism."
3,Just another book on how to use Cisco routers,Nothing special about this book. It teaches you how to setup various routing protocols on Cisco routers. But it doesn't teach you much about routing itself. Many other books do the same at much lower price. I guess it is good book for reference purposes for Cisco users but not helpful at all for non-Cisco users in any way.I also used GNS3 open source network simulator in our collage lab along with this book.
4,"Unique, useful, insightful book. NOT a checklist, though","This book was useful to me. I realized that I was mourning a move two moves ago! :-) Explains a lot of the emotional stuff we go through as part of a move that we may not be expecting, may not understand, other may not be prepared to support us through. This book isn't a ""how-to"" checklist type of book. It was unique look at moving, how to decide whether to move, steps you can take to make the move smooth and derail any possible emotional upsets. Well worth the price."
5,what women don't know and men won't tell you,"This is a very good book. But then, I love anything written by Michele Hammond Mckinney. I learn so much from her books. I think the advice she gives can also apply to friendships as well as intimate relationships. This book coupled with the ""He's Just Not That Into You"", book, would arm a woman with everything she needs to know to pick the right man or friend."
5,wise word. great insight,This is a must read for ladies. Insightful. I love this book. At times we tend to forget our name.
3,Fun read,"Robert Macomber writes about an era and in places very rarely touched by American Fiction. This book was a little ""round and round"" at times but was a fun read."
4,"OK for teachers, great for everyone else.","This book is excellent for anyone interested in the basics internet technology. It is pitched at teachers, but actually I felt that most of the recommended teaching practices were impractical. I used to teach at a laptop school, and I wouldn't be able to implement most of them there, let alone at a school with only a computer lap. However, teachers can use these techniques to stay up to date in their subject area and to learn about new teaching practices. That alone makes this book worthwhile."
3,Great All-around trimmer until...,"This is my 2nd Fiskars trimmer in about 15+ years. I didn't hesitate buying a Fiskars replacement. I accidently dropped the thing and lost the orange blade unit. I inserted the replacement blade and it just does not cut the same; not even making contact without several swipes. By that time, I'm not getting a clean edge. The blade unit can only go into the track in one way so I don't get why it's not cutting. Time to look for another more sturdy model..."
2,Not the best,"This trimmer cuts well, however there are not enough measurement marks. If you are trimming a 4*6 picture down to a 4*3 picture you have the guide at the bottom, but nothing in the middle to make sure you really have it lined up straight. I found I had to really pay attention to the bottom edge of the photo holding it securly against the edge. If you had one that wasn't a straight edge guessing is the only option."
3,Review of this movie,"Actions were not good that I had expected. This was a C-rank movie. If you like (or love) female action movies, I recommend to watch other movies (for example, Xena Warrior Princess series, Dark Angel, Tomb Layder, etc)."
2,Not that impressed,I have a 1 GHz + system that is a little over 1 years old and I am using W98. I liked the Disk Minder (comparable to ScanDisk) feature which performed well (I think) and fast on my 19 Mb hard drive.However two other features turned me off. Crash Guard did not work at all and Discover Pro repeatedly froze my system and forced me to power down whether I tried to run it from an installation on the hard drive or from the CD ROM.All in all I found nothing exceptional about this product.
3,Decent exam guideline,"To prepare for the BW certification test I recommend reading this book. To start working as a BW consultant I recommend reading other books as well. Many subjects are only briefly mentioned, because the author judges they are not important for the exam."
4,Concise & easy to read,"If you are new to BW and looking for a brief, but yet detailed overview, this book will help you grasp the bigger picture of BW. The practice tests at the end of chapters makes sure you are really understanding the concepts and terminology. The ""Note"" and ""SAP Restriction"" symbols thru the book draws your attention to key points. If ""Mastering the SAP Business Information Warehouse"" drowns you in detail -- this will be a breath of fresh air! Great resource for training people new to BW and it's concepts."
5,My son's favorite movie!,"My son is 21 months old and this is his favorite movie by far! He's not really into cartoons, but instead prefers animal documentaries. We literally watch this movie every day (we watch it on Netflix with instant streaming). Even though we have Netflix, I'm getting a copy of the DVD so we can have it with us when we travel. He gets so excited when we turn it on and calls it the ""roar"". I pretty much have the thing memorized at this point. If I have to watch something over & over, this is much better than cartoons! And unlike a lot of other animal documentaries, it doesn't show animals killing or eating other animals that much. I prefer not to watch that kind of stuff. It mainly shows scientists tracking down tigers in the wild to gain information on them and then the second part of it focuses on a Russian scientist who keeps 2 tigers in a large enclosure. It's a little old (I think it was produced in the 90's?), but if you're into tigers, this is your movie!"
5,Terrific Raw Blues/Rock Music,"Love this album, it is fantastic. Begin with the first song Torch and you will feel the raw edginess of this album. But you're just getting started from song three If I Leave This World Tommorrow (a blues masterpiece) to the end of the album a true blessing for any Christian or for any blues fan period. This is as good of an album as I have purchased. Love the songs #5 Whisper,#7 Winter Sun, #9 Do Lord and #11 In The Soul OF A Man. These four plus the previous #3 mentioned are my favorites but I seldom skip songs on this album all tracks very worthy of play and talk about playing his band is great also , excellant bass and terrific guitar work with special guest Dave Beegle on tracks 10-12. Buy this album, listen and enjoy."
4,incredibal one,"When I found this book in the library and did not find it the next day(it just had been checked out), I know I need to get one myself. I need to take the Toefl Test again, since my last Toefl score expired. The 30 days' step by step preparation save me a lot of trouble , and I don't even worry about what should I study within the short period of time. If you are kind of familir with what's going on in the Toefl Test, just buy it."
5,2005: The Year Of Kreator,"German thrash/speed metal legends Kreator have already kicked off 2005 with their new album Enemy Of God, and thus far, it's the best new album I've listened to this year. This album has it all, wonderfully written lyrics, ear piercing vocals, killer guitar riffs, shredding solos, thunderous double bass drum assaults, you name it. There's even a bonus video too, and it kicks ass. No pansy ass Linkin Park or A.F.I here, this is the real deal. My favorite songs are Enemy Of God, Impossible Brutality, Dystopia, Suicide Terrorist, World Anarchy, Murder Fantasies, heck the whole album is great. 2005 is definately going to be another great year for true and pure heavy metal, buy Kreator's Enemy Of God now and prepare to be beaten senseless.Be sure to check out upcoming albums from Slayer (I hope it comes out this year), Judas Priest and among others. STAY METAL."
2,Save your money,"With 11 years of weight training for football and lacrosse I've come across and tried numerous different programs. I also review about three different books/programs a year. Each program's success was a direct result of the individual effort put into it. Just as in his strength book ""Power to the People,"" Pavel really does not present any new information or 'breakthroughs.' Pavel could have compressed the book and also eliminated the final half-dozen or so pages of ads for his other books and products. The principles presented do work, but again, the cost of the book will lead to some disappointment with the value of the information given."
5,Where has this guy been all my life?,"My mother always said better late than never. This probably best describes how little I really knew about stretching and how much I learned from this book. Easy reading, to the point,and best of all effective. The amount of time saved getting the flexibility you want and need makes the book one of the best investments you can make as an athlete."
3,Good,"Straight dope on stretching. I didn't care for the way the subject matter was treated and it's light on human anatomy but the techniques to push beyond your previous stretching limits are backed up in other research I've read on the subject, so I believe it can help you increase your flexibility if that's your goal."
2,Don`t buy,"As all Povel books this is as well expensive compared to the info. Also don`t forget if you are old enough and/or your ligaments not flexible enough(from born or if you did not start stretching your legs from a very young age) you never won`t be able to stretch your legs as seen on pictures in this book. But you can stretch to a degree and it is fine for you, no problem."
4,Notable attempt at capturing salient points from larger work,"Harwell does a good job of pulling together and redacting DS Freeman's epic VII Volume (actually VI - he died before publishing the 7th) account of George Washington's life. I often find myself wishing he would annotate, at least on a chapter basis, which volumes of the larger work he is pulling his info from.A basic understanding of the extreme hardships early Americans (Colonists) went through can be gathered through this book, and this understanding should be required basic knowledge in all schools. The birth of this nation, was founded on some of the most remarkable physically, financially, emotionally and seemingly impossible acheivements by a few who had the courage to see the delivery through. Freeman captured these trials and victories in marvelous detail."
4,good if you don't have time to read the unabridged version,"Douglas Southall Freeman's unabridged Washington biography would be the best thing for serious students of American history. It is one of the best Washington biographies and the author won a Pulitzer Prize.Richard Harwell has done a good job with this abridgement for people who don't have time for the full work.I notice that some reviewers think this work is ""dry,"" however the original is also dry, and more so! But both versions are full of important information.The introduction and afterward contain some useful biographical information about Freeman and were written by Michael Kammen and Dumas Malone, also Pulitzer Prize winners.John Christmas, author of ""Democracy Society"""
1,flag flying at half mast,"I am a big Flag and Bloomfield fan, so imagine my disappointment when I bought and listened to this piece of garbage. Sound quality is poor to fair, and the band sounds like it phoned in their performance, much like the show I saw during their reunion tour in the mid-70s.For a glimpse of this band firing on all cylinders, check out the Monterey Pop DVD or Best of the Flag, which has 2 bonus live tracks from Monterey."
3,"My daughter enjoyed it, BUT",It fell apart. I honestly can't tell you anything about what the book is about. I am only commenting on the books condition. It only took about a week and all the pages starting coming unglued. She is 9 years old and is gentle with her books.She rates the book as 5 stars.
5,The Waiting Has Ended!,"Arigato! I have just recently started reading the Manga Version of Sailor Moon. If any of you watch the series on TV then you will LOVE this! First off they keep Chibi-Usa's name as CHIBI-MOON not Mini! If that's the case then it HAS to be good, right? I won't spoil it for those that haven't read it but let's just say that the manga is all that and much MUCH more then the Anime! There are alot of things in the Manga, Which I personally like better, that aren't even IN the anime! Even is you haven't ever seen Sailor Moon in your life then I recomend this to you! But you should most likely read the rest of the series so that you don't get confussed! ~_~"
5,Excellent product,Can't say enough about this great hand soap. It smells divine and washes off cleanly -- not a ton of lather. Perfect for the kitchen but I also use it in my bathrooms. Hope they never discontinue this one!
1,"packaging ""stinks""","The cucina hand wash refill was packaged with a dvd series. Why??? The cucina leaked and entire package was soaked. I was shorted hand wash refill and had a mess to clean up. Yes, the dvd packaging was also soaked. Thank goodness the dvds were not ruined. These were gifts, so I felt bad about the ""stink"" of the hand wash refill on the dvd package. Hopefully this will not happen to anyone else. Concerned"
4,Great low key indie comedy,"Roger Dodger is a great low key indie film about a boy yearning to become a man. Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) seeks out his uncle Roger (Campbell Scott) in order to bring an alpha male role model into his life. Eisenberg's portrayal hints at future success, with subtleties and nuances of a veteran actor even this early in his career. Scott beautifully develops an inherently flawed character who perceives himself as exactly what Nick needs, but discovers that he isn't even serving his own best interest with his actions and behaviors.As long as you can handle some heavy dialogue and some dark humor, Roger Dodger shouldn't disappoint."
5,Perfect.,"I couldn't get into their earlier work, because I prefer heavy music. Not to say it wasn't good, but I just can't get into it. I am happy they chose this direction, because they do it well. I also had the pleasure of watching them live, which was also something they do very well. This album is mixed well (Fascination Street Studios), written well, and there is no filler material. So its well! I am a big fan of all kinds of metal, but usually not power metal. However, this album is heavy and edgy. It has symphonic elements that I'm fond of."
2,Very basic. Expensive.,"I had a $10 coupon and there was free shipping so I thought I would take a chance. There are so many better books like ""Literary Agents: What They Do, How They Do It, and How to Find and Work with the Right One for You, Revised and Expanded by Michael Larsen"" and ""Agents Directory 2004: 2004 (Agents Directory, 2004) by Rachel Vater"" and ""2004 Writer's Market by Kathryn S. Brogan"". These are serious books on how to get published. This book, I should say pamphlet since it is so short, has very little and very basic information on how to get published. You could obtain the information on writing for free on the internet. The price of this booklet is way out of proportion to any value you will receive."
2,Enterprise D versus the powerful ancient Artifact.,"Powerful Artifacts threatening a Strek Trek crew is a typical scenario. This is the first STTNG novel that deals with the scenario, not entirely successfully.Not one of the stand-out novels in the series."
2,"No instruction, just moves.",The moves on this video are really cute however there is no instruction. It's only pure dancing so your child will have to watch it over and over and memorize by sight only.
4,Warm Socks,Item arrived on time and packaging was fine. I have used item several time and they keep my feet warm.I will be buying more from shipper.My feet get cold easy since having chemo and recommend to anyone that gets cold feet.Nice made product and fits well!
3,Ok ipod speaker system w/alarm,"This unit does not have a radio, but it is ok if all you need is a speaker system with an alarm. The extra sounds are ok, but don't need them. Nice unit size to not take up my night stand space. Really enjoy lighted big numbers with adjustable light. Line in allows ipod or other input device to be out of harms way as I fumble around for snooze button."
4,A Must Read For All Yoga Beginner's,"This book has helped me begin a lifetime of Yoga practice. Not to follow the trend (if there is one) but for my health, for I suffer from migraines caused by stress and anxiety. And to think I am only 20 years old, and feel like I am 40. So far my health has changed for the better. I didn't have a clue about Yoga until I read the book, and now I feel like a smarty-pants. Only one complaint about this book...not enough pictures."
5,All time great -classic book on Yoga,"This book by James Hewitt is a classic book. I studied it in late 1960's and then again came to it a few years ago in Palo Alto library. Along with B K S Iyengar's ""light on Yoga"" and Swami Vishnudevananda's ""complete Illustrated Book of Yoga"" , this complete book is comprehensive and lucidly written and well illustrated. While the other two are written by Indian masters, James's book is for western readers by a Englishman in simple style, with less Sanskrit terms.In the 1960's and later, this book introduced yoga to millions of readers in UK and elsewhere.It has been used as an instruction manual in many certification courses. If you are a Yoga instructor, you must refer to this book as part of instruction .I wish the book is reprinted with better illustrations ,especially for use of yoga instructors."
2,"overly long, rambling, supposition","As with the previous reviewer here i had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately i found this the most irritating biography i have ever read. There is way too much padding and repetition from chapter to chapter. This book is at least 100 pages too long. chapters go off at tangents that have nothing at all to do with Nick. The interesting parts are contemporary recollections of old school and college friends where we get to know that Nick was a normal teenager and university guy. Interviews with joe boyd, robert kirby, and brian wells give us more insight into his method (or lack of it) in the studio. However, what should be made aware is that nothing from John Martyn or most importantly Gabrielle Drake means he relies a lot on old interviews to gain a perspective. This is like an overly long 6th form essay (well researched but poorly written)"
5,t h e p i n k m o o n i s o n i t s w a y,"I wish Nick had lived to see the following he has today. I think he was one of the greatest musicians of all time, and I think the book pays tribute to the man he was. This book captures what Nick was, and I think it is one of the best biographies ever written. I heard Nicks' music a long time ago, and I learned a lot about him, but there was so much more I wanted to know, and this book tells everything. I read the book in one sitting and when I was done I couldn't stop thinking about him. I have always loved Nick, but after reading the book, I see that there is much more to him than I ever thought. I wish there were more books on Nick. I think most people would love his music, and love reading about him. I gave the book five stars. It is a classic."
2,overrated,"A real disappointment, as I had heard such good things about the film. Rather dull overall, lacking a spark; also a bit dated"
2,Princess of Burundi is no jewel,"The Princess of Burundi was a rather dull and plodding police procedural.None of the characters were particularly compelling or well drawn. The detectives seemed pale imitations of other Swedish police characters and all possessed a ""sameness"" that made it hard to distinguish one from the other. As for the plot, plodding: no real mystery at all."
1,A piece of garbage.......,"Purchased this for my 7 year olds room. Minute we put it up and put her clothes in it, KABOOM, started falling apart. Contacted the company and they gave me the only hard time. They refunded me $18.33, 10% of the purchase order. They refused to help me in any other way. DO NOT BUY FROM SOUTH SHORE..... EXPENSIVE AND THEY ONLY SELL CHEAP CRAP!!!!!!!!"
2,Horrible Quality!!,"Despite the negative reviews I read about this product, I ordered it anyway from BabyAge through Amazon's website. First, when the product came in, the flimsy box was torn up and had a six inch hole in one of the corners. The ""wood"" pieces were barely painted and had streaks in it that showed the ""wood"" underneath in random places. It looked like someone had given it a thin coat of paint and then went back in random places and put a second coat. Had the whole thing had a second coat of paint it would have looked decent. At that point we boxed the product back up and had to pay 70 dollars to ship it back to the company. I was afraid I wouldn't get my money back since the seller says items must be unopened and in original condition (which wasn't how it was shipped to me in the first place), but I did. I decided to order the four drawer south shore dresser instead and am very pleased with it."
3,its ok,"hard to put together, ok quality.. I suppose better than many..but still just average quality"
1,You get what you pay for,"Although there isn't a thing wrong with the content of the book, the publishing and editing format that was adopted in order to save money is atrocious. This particular publisher uses an insturment to scan the original book, and then prints what it reads 'as is'. I had not necessarily bought this edition for it's cost, but after I received it and looked back through the other options I had, I only saved two dollars. This is a book I intended on having on my bookshelf for generations to come. I have learned my lesson and will keep an eye out for these 'making books affordable' publishers."
1,Don't pull out more than 15 feet!,"I bought this reel for my garage, it worked well for about a month and then I pulled the cord out to about 25 feet and the spring broke. I emailed the company looking for a fix, and never got a response. I really would have liked to give a better review, but the company's non response results in this product going to the garbage."
3,"Not the best. . .but not the worst, either","I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who say Susan is changing. I attribute some of her scatterbrained behavior in this book to mother-of-the-bride nerves, but she's actually been less flighty in earlier books during events that were far more traumatic than this (The 40th Birthday Body, for example). But let's be honest--she's a Baby Boomer and Boomers are portrayed in our culture as self-absorbed and pre-occupied with not aging. So Susan's a little flawed. I do hope that in future stories, she'll get some of her true detective sense back, and start enjoying this stage of life she's entering as the children are growing up and leaving home."
4,"Slow Start, but worth the wait","Since I like both the authors I decidec to pick up this book. Despite a somewhat slow beginning, this was an excellent book. The wonderfully thoughtout alien that is just not a human in an alien suit is a William H. Keith hallmark. Delightful Alien aliens make this book a keeper. The advanced technology is not used as a crutch to cover a lack of story. This book gets better the second time around, and I found things that I missed the first go 'round. While somewhat implausable, the suspension of disbelief is complete, and you find yourself identifying with the various aliens in this hilarious romp through Hollywood's darker side. Well worth the price."
3,"Interesting, Funny.","I really liked this book, it has some interesting takes on Sci-Fi and television, and how others would view/judge us from our Television output."
4,A good supplement,"This book is a very good guide to the secondary issues of project management. The author goes into detail on topics such as managing complexity, extending projects to include operations and support, building teams with borrowed resources, resource estimation and a variety of other topics. The topics are valid, the writing is clear, but the writing style is very verbose. On the one hand, the topics are relevant only for project management professionals, but the writing style is for beginning project managers. This is a good book to read after to get your PMP certification."
2,Lassie Come Home DVD,"Bought this DVD for my grandchildren,thinking of Lassie as ""timeless""-unfortunately much of the background story of War[WW2] is not relevant to 5-6 year olds.Also discovered that the DVD code was incompatible with my player,so had to get my son -fortunately savvy re these things- to enter my area code into my unit,after which there was no problem.Personally I enjoyed the nostalgic elements and the scenery but think the modern generation would find it boring."
4,Lassie movies,Three Lassie movies on one DVD. I saw them all growing up andit was well worth it for a trip back down memory lane.Very wholesome family fare.
3,Twist and shout,"'Twelve Red Herrings' bears the trademark of 'twist in the tale' and 'a quiver full of arrows'- common of Jeffrey Archer. But perhaps a little too much. 'one man's meat' was especially disappointing as nothing really comes out of the story, and in fact for all the twelve twisting herrings, nothing really came out of it at all, except for the fact that the reader would be ridiculed if he or she should try to predict the endings, some of which are totally unthinkable, and unthinkable indeed, because you would probably have to meditate over and over to get WHY or HOW it should happened. This book leaves too much for the reader to ponder. Not for those looking for before-bedtime entertainment. A practice of his personal style that is quite untunable to."
4,"Good, But Pricey","This toy is pretty dang sweet, it is just to much money ya know. I can Hardly afford it, I mean I have only fifty dollars (I spend all of my money, thats why I dont have alot)I mean I dont really want to use it all on a G.I. Joe because I am going to buy an X-Box 360 ya know wat im sayin?"
5,great throwback show,this was great show and still is. it was a present to my friend and we watch these dvd all the time. Transformers is definitely a classic.
3,Buy Second Edition,"I own Wheatley's Collectable Glass Shoes, second edition, a wonderful book for glass and china shoe collectors. I love the color photos and descriptions and lay-out. I bought the first edition hoping that it would contain pictures of shoes that were not kept for the second edition. After comparing the books, I find that the second edition is far better. I hope this wonderful author and collector creates a third edition. The prices listed are wildly inflated compared to what I have observed being paid on Ebay."
3,clarence the cross eyed lion,i got this tape because i so enjoyed the tv series dakari. it is about the adventures of a cross eyed lion who lives in a nature preserve run by a vet. the quality of the film was poor.
1,Very Dissapointed,"While the pictures in ""The Jewel Box Garden"" are great and may provide the reader with some inspiration, the author's condescending and judgemental text is pedestrian and fails to provide the reader with any original ideas regarding how to think about and plan a great place in a small space."
5,A must for all ELO fans,"My 10 and six year old sons love ELO, thanks to my old records, cassettes and CDs. Now we can listen to one of ELO's best efforts. We think Latitude 88 is good. I'd give it a 8 out of 10. Now we're good for a few years until we wear out this CD and need a replacement CD! Any serious fan must buy this and let the younger generation hear ELO!"
2,Sellout Time,"When this album came out before Christmas 1977, I was waiting with baited breath. After the strong performances on ""Eldorado"", ""Face The Music"" and ""A New World Record"", I was expecting great things from this talented band.What a disappointment!It was apparent by the end of the first side that ELO had traded in what was left of their progressive leanings for commercial success. By the time I was done listening to ""Sweet Talkin' Woman"", I knew the direction had changed. The rest of the album made it clear that they were interested in a more general sound, and while they would experiment with some styles, the synth-heavy sound was around to stay in the hope of filling the album with potential singles.Mission accomplished."
4,Great packaging but don't sell your old ZGK 35530 CD just yet!,"I'm glad Jeff Lynne re-released this album. It's one of my favorites. The details are great with the bonus tracks.But....I compared it to the Joe Gastwirt remastered version and the sound of Joe's version is fuller, bigger, warmer and clearer. This is important of a recording to mess with. I wish it was in 5.1 (The Whale). Joe Gastwirt's remastered versionOut of the Blue"
3,"Turgid, but informative","Edward Bulwer-Lytton (""It was a dark and stormy night...), move over! If you can stomach Claiborne Young's cutesy, ""irrepressible little-old me"" writing style, this guide offers a wealth of detailed and useful information, as do his many other guides. The cringe factor is less prevalent in the navigational sections of the book, which I find the most concise and useful."
4,Cruising guide,"Good information but a bit out o date, yet useful. What more can I say, it's a good book. but nees updating!"
2,Amplifier,"Hello, me being a guitarist and a 14 year old, this really isn't what you should get, first, its really expensive for only 10 watts, for that much you can get at most 30 watts at your local music store, which I personally think would be good for a begginner, because they could change the volume well, have more effects, and you learn alot more about music on bigger amps! Second, it just does not give you enough options, and its not great quality, you want to buy a good sounding and durable amp if your willing to spend at least $70-80 without tax, this way you or your child won't sound muffled, distorted or have maybe unwanted feedback or radio signals."
1,"Used to have one of these in my shop for setting up guitars, no more...","This amp is SO bad. I used to have one knocking around in my shop for when I set up a guitar, just for intonation and tuning. It was so bad I couldn't even use it for that. Just take your $45 and go to a pawn shop, or used music store and buy anything else. Anything..."
2,"it was okay, but not great","this was a modern retelling of the story of the three fates of greek/roman lore. the fates had modern names and modern tools. the play centers on the three ladies deciding whether or not to cut some guy's thread of life. they do, and then he pleads with them, etc. etc.the language was not very believable, they talked like valley girls and didn't seem deep or very interesting.if you're looking for information on the Fates, don't get this book. if you're looking for a play to put on in high school, this would probably be okay."
5,American-made vs. American-owned?,"This book is an eye-opener for those who think that buying American is just a matter of looking on the label. Simmermaker's book is chock full of information about how we can support companies that are American-owned even when we are forced to buy foreign-labeled goods.How Americans Can Buy American, now in its third edition, is the premier book on practical economic patriotism. It is obvious that Mr. Simmermaker has a fierce and passionate zeal for the economic promotion of his native land.This book goes beyond merely compiling lists of American-made goods and services. Simmermaker has dug deep to find out, in cases where there are no American-made products, which foreign-made goods are made by American-owned companies.In a time when more and more items are made exclusively overseas, this additional research proves valuable to those who want to support our nation's domestic economy even when they are forced to buy an item manufactured overseas."
4,Great Interest,"This book is well written and a must read for all who want to support American industries. I have recommended this book to family, friends, and members of Congress. Although we have been product label readers for a long time, our eyes have been further opened to purchasing wisely."
2,Do Not Allow Book Title To Mislead You!,"[[ASIN:0980118808 How Americans Can Buy American: The Power of Consumer Patriotism - Third Edition] ]Initially my husband & I were thrilled to run across this book because we mistakenly thought it would be a great source for locating products made solely in America. This is not the case. Although some of the products listed in this book are made domestically, many are imports. We are very disappointed with this book & feel as though we were misled by the title. Unfortunately, we would not recommend it for anyone hoping to find a vast source of products which are solely made in the USA."
3,Not as impressed as the other reviewers,"This book is based in fact and has a nice timeline on the migration era. But I did find myself questioning the author in several places --Is the western defense industry a manifestation of the battle ax culture? (if so, where do other defense industries come from?)Were berserkers manipulated into frenzy by politically astute leaders whose sole aim was to exploit them for personal gain? (Many historic records indicate otherwise and Dr. Metzner offers no documentation to back up many of his opinions.)Do the Elder Gods reach from the past with messages of conservation and environmentalism? (gimme a break, some ideas do evolve over time)While the migration era timeline is an excellent resource, the author seems more influenced by Viet Nam era propaganda than his is by actual knowledge of early culture. For that I recommend reading authors such as Tacitus, Paul Bauschatz, Michael Enright and Stephen Pollington."
3,mentholatum review,"I have been putting this stuff under my nostrils before bed since 1967 and you can't buy it in a store anymore, so I was happy to find it online."
2,it could be so much more user friendly!,"Parts of this book, especially chapter 10 and 11, are written in nearly pure mathematical formulas with very limited explanation. The worst part is that many of those problems are fairly simply if you understand it. The algorithms that are the main part of chapter 11 could be explained in a much easier way. Instead of trying to decipher them yourself, which may take hours, speak to someone that knows the subject and you will be surprised how easy all this really is.I think the author decided that since this book is designed for Comp Science majors it must be written in an EXTREMELY concise way which made parts of it also extremely hard to understand. Too bad, because it really did not have to be that way."
4,Good,Good book that explains Database Management Systems and how they work. Would recommend also picking up a book on SQL and/or Oracle.
1,"Complete waste of paper, poorly written book.","I had to buy this book for my graduate level course, and what a waste of money and paper. The authors of this book are completely out of touch with current database technologies in the market. This book contains superfluous and invalid assumptions, and topics. Not only the materials are not correct, but the format it is presented, is very confusing and useless. I could not rate this book less than 1, otherwise I would. If your instructor is asking to buy this book for any classes, just drop the course."
2,For the mathematically inclined ONLY,This was our textbook for intro to databases (3rd year class). I don't think I learned a thing from it... If you have a really great mathematical mind and you think in terms of sets and relations then it might be your thing. I now have a decent practical understanding of databases but every time I go back to this text as a reference it still makes no sense at all. </p>It is pretty complete... but it is highly unlikely you could actually learn anything from it.</p>
2,Not for the novice,"Luckily I bought this book at a book fair and it did not cost too much. I am currently doing my graduate course in IT and thought this book would help. Unfortunately it is extremely time consuming to read because of the complicated writing style of the author(s), the text is littered with mathematical equations and complicated wording. It may be fine for the professionals but beginners could find a book that is a lot easier to understand."
1,I feel dumber now...,"This book is required for my database class; I wish it weren't. The sentence structure is absolutely atrocious. Whatever happened to publishers checking for complete sentences??? Because of the poor sentences, I loose focus and do other things (like write this review).Surprisingly, this is not the most frustrating part of the book. Why do I need flip hundreds of pages backward to learn a topic or do a problem? The authors rely on you spending more time flipping the pages of their book than actually reading it (this may be intentional since the writing itself is poor).If you don't have to get this book I wouldn't. Otherwise I feel sorry for you and wish you keep your sanity..."
4,Good Theory Book,"I found the book to be excellent complementary material for the examination I was preparing to take. The book is well-organized, thorough, and extensive on theory although a bit light on the practical aspects of databases. I purchased this book because Excelsior College recommended it as a study aid for the ICCP Data Resources certification examination. Nevertheless, if you are preparing for the ICCP exam you will still have to buy the Bird review or similar because of the way the exams are set up."
5,Very good alligator clips.,"I'm very pleased with the build quality of these. Not only are the crimped, but they are sottred as well. Good quality and i expect them to last a long time. Very pleased customer."
2,Had to look online for what I wanted to do,"I thought this would be a good book to learn Photoshop with because it came from the software maker. Unfortuately this was not the case. By following the book's instructions, I was not able to add a simple border to an image. I ended up doing a Google search from which I found the instructions on an online forum. As it turned out the Adobe book had left out a step of how to select the image. (You can't just click on the image) So, as a result of this missing step, the menu item I needed was grayed out so I couldn't add the border. Also, the pictures in the book are not in color, they are black & white only. This makes it difficult to figure out which tool bar icon they are trying to get you to go to.I just bought another Photoshop book because this one is useless."
3,Don't Buy It Without the CD,"If you buy used, be sure the CD is included as it is essential to following the lessons. I am ordering a second copy, new, so I will have the CD."
1,"we can only hope this is the ""final""one","this is one of those bottom of the rock ""slasher"" movies of the 80's. the story rips off every other slasher movie out and doesn't even do that well. not scary or funny just a waste of time and disc space. save your money."
5,Excellent Sleep Mask - Great Price Too,"These are a great value - we've seen inferior products for two and three times this price. I know it's only a sleep mask but hey, it gets the job done.Pros:- effective light blocking- perhaps the lightest feeling sleep mask I've had - feather light - hardly notice them- comfortable- no seams- adjustable and velcro so there's no pressure and you hardly know you're wearing them- it's been my experience that light blocking is never 100% but these are the best I've tried so there it is. In my opinion, it's hard to achieve 100% - that's kind of a function of face structure and luck - you'd probably need a custom built mask or one that's so large it would be like a hood and uncomfortable in my opinion.My wife recommended these and I think she is right - these are winners!"
3,Good but falling apart,"I've had this sleep mask for a while now. I recognize the fact that it lets light in around the nose as others have commented, but I'll deal with that as it seems a common complaint to all of the designs. In general, it works great. BUT, it's really falling apart, and I've had it less than 6 months and I don't use it all the time. I suppose a little fabric glue can cure my ills, and a bit of sewing the velcro back on. Guess items from Sri Lanka are of the same quality as items from China."
1,Not impressed,"First of all this product is identical to the ""Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask"" by Dream Essentials, except the Sweet Dreams mask costs less. I ordered both, and they are identical.Second, the Velcro closure on the back of the head-strap forms an uncomfortable 'bump' on the back of my head that makes it almost impossible to sleep with this mask on.Third, the mask does leak some light in around the nose, but I am more upset about the 1st two points. I didn't want two of the same mask, particularly when the 2nd one cost me more than the first.Do not buy this mask under any circumstances. If you want it, do an Amazon search for ""Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask"" instead, it is the same thing for less money."
1,"Not aware of the meaning behind what is a ""region 2"" DVD","Although, I really enjoy the movie, ""Foreign Correspondent"" I didn't realize when I ordered it that the signification ""region 2"" pertained to DVD players OUTSIDE the U.S. and Canada. Only ""region 1"" discs can be played in the U.S. I would suggest when ordering any DVD, one should note that distinction. So without that knowledge, I received an unplayable DVD. Live and learn!"
3,Not user-friendly for casual users,I'm not sure if this works -- or if it's just too hard to figure out. I am an adult and don't have alot of time to sit and work with this thing. My husband and I have yet to get it hooked up to the t.v. like it's supposed to be. Our son just plays it like a guitar...which I probably could've gotten cheaper than this. Not a complete loss -- but disappointing.
2,Fisher Price I can Play Guitar,We are having a lot of problems with this item. I think that the wire to it is faulty. We have to jiggly it around a lot to get it to connect to the TV & sometimes it will not connect.
4,Diamond in the Rough,"This is the typical novel you come to expect from Jackie. Lifestyles of the rich and truly spoiled. This novel focuses on the lives of the 3 Diamond brothers (Max, Chris and Jett) who try to make something out of their lives despite the fact that their father, Red tries to sabotage them at every turn. I think that I have read all of Jackie's novels and never come across someone so despicable as Red Diamond.I also enjoyed the Birdy Marvel/Rocky storyline. You do not have to be a genius to figure out that it seems very familiar to the Britney Spears/Kevin Federline FIASCO. Reading about Birdy made me see how Britney could have gotten herself in all the mess that she is involved in. Jackie was that convincing.Can't wait to see who she writes about next, maybe Brad and Angelina???"
4,lovers and players,"i absolutely love this book, this again is another good book from jackie collins!!!!!!"
2,not her best work by far,"I have always loved Jackie Collins and anticipate all of her book releases. I was so excited to get this book, but am very disappointed in it. I just could not get into this book. I didn't even read all of it. I didn't find the characters interesting at all and was just bored with all of it. I will still read whatever she puts out, I just hope it is better than this next time."
4,Best available,"I am an ex pro audio installer. I can say these are the best component set of anything I have ever put in. The amount of bass is better than many three way component sets, it sounds like 8"" subs. Also the power handling and shear output volumn is incredible. The sound quality is also high performance. Yes, the crosssovers are massive, put together they are the size of a small amp, so you need to plan on making room. The tweets come with three different mounting options and everything you need to mount them. The main speakers are massive although mount depth is not much more than a low end counterpart, just check the mount depth specs first if you are concerned. I remeber back when this set was bringing around $500 and for the price now you can not beat it. You will not be sorry."
4,Great Book!,"I think this book is very interesting! Emily,Jessup and their family go to Scotland. They are going to visit Castle Keep. The castle belonged to one of their relatives. After the family returned back to Canada they brought a desk containing the boggart. When they got home many strange things happened. If you want to know who the boggart is you will have to read this book. I would recommed this book to kids who like interesting and exciting stories!"
2,...,"I know what it's like to be cast out because of appearance. Everyone experiences it at some point. I related very much to Heather in the beginning.Unfortunately, I don't know anyone who's been judged and teased to be as dramatic as her. All she does is weep. Literally, every other page ends with something like ""...and she wept."" She was so rude to Damien, not firm or strong, just rude and loud and argumentative. Everything was a such a big deal.The sentence that bothered me the most was, ""She pressed the back of her hand to her forehead.""What is this, a play? Who puts the back of their hand to their forehead? Unless they're checking for a fever.Then again, this WAS written more than a decade ago. James has written much better since this."
3,Iraq For Sale,"I saw this show on The History Channel and made it a mission to get this on DVD. What this DVD shows is how the Americans are being treated, both military and civilian. IT IS DISGUSTING. All the wasted tax money I saw in the show made me SICK. A lot of the money President Bush wants and got I feel is going to made the subcontractors richer at the cost of American lives. The money needs to stop going there. They don't need more to waste. Definitely recommend this DVD to see where your tax money is going."
2,"Take that rap, please...","This is a standard, more or less, Jet Li vehicle which emphasizes his incredible speed and fluidity of motion. The script is no stranger than most, the casting is excellent and the action is phenomenal (especially the warehouse/construction site brawl). The fatal flaw with this film is the soundtrack, not the tpe of music, but the volume. It is so loud it overpowers the sound effects and the pieces that have been chosen's rhythyms don't mesh with the action on screen. It makes the fight sequences feel out of sync. If the soundtrack is scrubbed and replaced with rap songs with a more appropriate beat and mixed so that the sound effects could be heard, I'd give this movie two more stars."
4,Classic Jet-Li,If you like Jet-Li you are sure to like this movie. Some people may have a problem with the voice overs. Even Jet-Li is voiced over; he obviously did not speak very good English at the time. Fast paced action with some superb coreography.
4,"Slick Action, averge plot","I had to watch this movie twice before I could fully appreciate the quick edited fight scenes and wire acrobatics. Jet Li is a awsome presence to action films. One of the best action dudes ever. This one makes the fight sences in the Matrix look corny, but also by choreographer Ping."
3,"Excellent Action, cheezy plot","Black Mask is a must have for any Martial Arts enthusiast. In the tradition of Chineese film making the plot is cheezy by Western standards. The asians just have a different sense of humor and romantic involvement than westerners.As you watch the film I am sure you will question how the stunts were performed. I would also like to point out the graphic violence that sometimes seemed to go beyond what I have seen in other movies of this ilk.Excellent action, filmography, special effects, and apparently real physical feats are so great this movie is set apart from any other movie I have seen. The writing is very transparent and plot is, well, 12th grade.If you are a male between 12-22 and into martial arts, this is a five star movie. Younger than 12 I would advise parental permission. I am 40, into martial arts, and found the movie to be a good purchase."
2,"stop the rap music, please","Just because someone might be a fan of martial arts movies, doesn't mean they want to listen to an hour and a half of backround rap music. I would rather have seen the original Hong Kong version of this movie because the American distributor made a joke out of this. Every scene is punctuated by rap or hip hop. So if you don't like that kind of music, this movie is hard to watch, which is a shame cause it's a pretty cool movie."
3,a beat them up.,if you go into this film expecting nothing more than a heap of fighting and stunts then you will probobly enjoy it. like most full on martial arts films the plots are weak and the characters are not often that strong. overall the same can be said about black mask. but as eye candy goes there are worse. if you like jet li or martial art movies then you will probobly enjoy this. just don't expect a casablanca.
3,"Good movie to buy, but this price is a bit too much","Just finished watching the DVD. G rateful to amazon.com for shipping it to Japan, but the price is a bit too much for this(still cheaper then going out on a Saturday night in Tokyo). In all honesty it is not a bad movie, plenty of action, awesome sound in 5.1 surround and good visual effects. Makes you wonder if any other country will ever come closer to Hollywood for action flicks. Rent it or buy at a lower price (sorry amazon.com)"
1,Jet Li Exploited,"I am a huge fan of Jet Li and am disgusted from this movie. Jet Li has so much talent and could do so much better. If you are not a Jet Li fan you may find this movie greatly entertaining, If you are a Jet Li fan you will be nearly sick. There is one good fight scene and it is very short. If you follow Jet Li movies you probably characterize him as some sort of super being. It is quite amusing to see Jet Li preform acrobatic confrontations against people weaker than him and several near equals in a film. In this movie every opponent is a super being. Basically its Jet Li starting a stunt only to be countered by a fifty year old man on wires. The mere sight of a old man kick off a wall, fly twenty feet on wires to kick an immobile Jet Li in the head made me wince. If you want some good martial arts movies buy The Enforcer, and Fist of Legend."
2,MATRIX was ALOT better!,"I'm so sorry I spent the $'s on this garbage movie. Some of the fighting scenes are OK, it made me laugh a couple of times, but it plain sucks. For now and on, when someone tells me a movie is good, I'm going to rent it first BEFORE i buy.I'm sorry, but this movie didn't live up to all the hype."
4,Tough as nails,"Carhartt never let's you down on quality, tough as nails, true to size fit, I have washed mine at the car wash twice so far and they hold up, comfortable and room in all the right places"
5,Awesome winter overalls!,"I agree with all the other reviewers. These overalls are warm, well made/tough, wind and water resistant, and very reasonably priced. Note: sizes seem a bit on the small side, I wear 38x30 jeans and got 44x30 overalls. After 1 wash they shrunk a waist size but I can still wear jeans and 3 top layers underneath - its a bit snug now but still comfortable. Length didn't seem to change much which is good. You will probably want to size up 8 inches if you want to wear bulkier stuff underneath. Washing and softening them is a good idea, they are quite stiff to start with."
5,love them,"I bought them for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves them! He works outside and they keep him warm and dry all day long. The delivery was very fast, it was ordered last minute and they gave me a delivery date of 12/26/10 and they arrived 12/23/10! I will definitely be ordering more product from them."
3,Very hard to fit,"The quality of this item is very good, the reason I rated it 3 stars is because it is very hard to size these correctly. I've just ordered my third pair, hopefully these will be right. I went to the carhartt website and ordered as they suggested, the first pair was too large, the second too small, I hope the third will be just right. I would suggest you try these on in a store first to get the right size. Amazon's return policy and quick shipping has been top notch, the only thing is I have to return and re-order rather than return for an exchange.Edit: Well the third pair did not fit me like I would have liked, but it will have to do. Try these on before you buy."
4,Exactly What You Want,"No other book out there can provide you with as much information on National Harvester as this reference does. It is organized very well, so one can find exactly what he wants, from a general idea to great details. A history lesson in one complete book, you'll find whatever you need in here."
5,Better than Walmart,"$10 for .6 square feet of wrapping paper from Target? Yeah, bunch of crap. I decided I was tired of being screwed by Target, so we ordered this instead. It's a lot thicker than wrapping paper, making it tougher to wrap stuff with, but at least it doesn't tear as easily. Expect to store it, because this will last you for a decade."
4,Did what is is supposed to do,"Smooth, sturdy, thick enough, decent price for amount of paper. Nothing exciting about wrapping paper so not much to say about it. It did the job."
3,it's huge!,"I didn't read carefully before ordering. I wanted plain brown paper for gift wrapping. I got a huge roll of brown paper which is too large to keep in the house for gift wrap, but is perfect for spreading on the floor and letting a bunch of kindergarteners scribble on it. So that's who I'm giving it to! (It would get 5 stars for that.)"
1,Gigantor web site missing?,I have just purchesed the book and can't connect to the web site. I also can't email the author at the above address. Does anyone have a clue what happened to Don Gaspar?
5,20 Guage Stranded Wire Test Clips,"The ten 14"" test leads have small 1"" clips that open to about 1/4"" wide. The clips are enclosed by a tight insulation cover. The clips are soldered onto the wire which is definitely a plus in quality. The wire is 20 gauge stranded rated at 600 volt. You receive two-each of the following colors: green, blue, red, white and black. I believe that these clips will be very useful in medium to light electrical work."
5,Great Value,"This bundle is a great value and has made trouble shooting much faster, safer, and best of all much less frustrating. Wires are good quality for my low voltage needs and couldn't find a better value..."
3,meh,"It was ok. the tubes for drinking are very skinny and create a lot of foam when trying to get liquid to go through...also, the helmet just has a sticker on it..."
5,Must have tool,"Great tool for tight spaces, all the bits I will ever need. eliminates running to the store for a bit. Ratchet worked well however does not fit in the case."
4,Nice kit.,"I purchased this kit recently when I needed an assortment of torx bits.I was quite pleased when I saw the vast assortment of bits that come with the kit. Everything is nicely laid out and the included ratchet handle is very nice.It would have been nice to have a conventional screwdriver handle included, but I can live without it.My only complaint is about the case. It seems very nicely made, but if you don't use the thin foam insert that comes in the case, many of the bits spill out into the case."
1,I do not receive my order.,"I did not receive my order, and I want my money back. They told me do something. I tried, but it did not work and I still did not get my money back."
1,Book is outdated,Lonely Planet was outdated. The maps are unreadable even if you have great eyesight like me. Get the free guide from the Seattle Tourism. It is way better.
4,Fun!,Just reading the history about Seattle is enjoyable before you arrive. I thought the suggestions on what to do and how to save were great. With little time to spare we had loads of fun using the book as our guide. Enjoy!
1,nightmares!!,"After reading this book to my five year old he woke up with nightmares. The book shows a kids ""proving"" to his friends that he can be around peanuts, with dire consequences. To my kid, who has lived through anaphylactic reactions, this brought up many unpleasant memories. Parents of young kids BEWARE."
3,Good introductory book,"This is a very short book that serves as a good introcutory book about the life of Charles Darqwin and his importance to science. However, if you want to dig deep into the mand an its achievements, you'll have to read a whole lotta more...Anyway, this book completely attends its pourpose: a brief biography that will make you wanna know more."
3,I received a different type than what I ordered,I ordered the dolphin or shark one and received a shipwreck instead. Didn't want to return it so I have kept it and hoping my granddaughter will still like it.
3,An Unusual Perspective on the American Revolution,"Who Comes to King's Mountain is a rare book, for it portrays the conflicting emotions of the Ulster Scots or Scots Irish settlers of the Appalachians over the coming of the Revolutionary War.The details are authentic and fascinating, but I couldn't give it a higher review because the writing is somewhat wooden and may lose YA readers."
5,A Perfect Blend,"I found this book to be a perfect blend of history and romance. While I agree that the idea of a 13 year old girl being sold into slavery is completely repulsive by today's standards it wasn't uncommon for girls this age to be married and expecting thier first child back in the era that the book is set in. I thought the characters were well thought out, the women were strong and intellegent and in fact the relationship between the four main women in the harem very well may have overshadowed the romance between Cyra an Selim. If you aren't much into history this book is probably not what you'd want to pluck from the shelves first, however if you like a well written story with lots of good history, definately pick this one."
4,Excellent start,"I liked this book and have been following the cycles in my strength training for quite some time. The principle of irradiation is interesting and I've since eliminated the idea of isolation and replaced it with emphasis. I like how this book teaches a practitioner to become strong without adding any mass. I would only give the book 4 stars because it is a start and not a one stop source for developing strength. For the price of the book, it should be. I have made significant gains on this program but have reached plateaus and I also find that when I abandon this training, my progress is quickly lost. I think the author purposely holds back information in his books so that he can later publish new books containing the missing information and make more money. This is no way to do business. All this aside, this is a great start to strength training but the book does have its limitations."
5,Worth the Investment,"I have been intelligently training and with weights reading related materials for 15 years-- both to gain strength and size and perform better in sports. I still learned a great deal in this book which was also easy to read.This book was especially helpful in implementing a lifestyle workout program that I could implement without being burned out. Before this program, I would lift a lot of weight in the gym but go home and struggle carrying the groceries in because my program left me weak and depleted for days. Now I am invigorated by my workout and stronger with FUNCTIONAL, real world strength because of Power to the People.I also saw IMMEDIATE results in the gym. This book is appropriate for all levels--beginner, intermediate, and advanced."
2,"Factual, but not worth the money","There are other, more comprehensive books on powerlifting out there, for less money. This book focuses on the deadlift and the ""floor press"", which a bench press on the floor. Yes, you lay on the floor, have someone hand you the bar, lower it until your elbows touch the ground, then press it back up. Nothing but a dangerous partial range bench press. The shoulder press involves pressing a barbell with one hand, by holding it in the middle. This makes it very unweildy, and unsafe especially for your wrist. The good info, on powerlifting fundamentals and periodization, are covered in better detail in many other and less expensive books."
2,"Lots of Money for so ""Little Information""","There are plenty of good ""reads"" out there that you want to read for much cheaper of a price. If you are a ""seasoned"" veteran of the iron game and think you may find some kind of ""russian secret"" in Tsatsouline's book, you are sadly mistaken! After reading the likes of McRobert, Dreschler, Bryzki, and Zatsiorsky (who Tsatsouline quotes in this book), this comrade is a ""joker"". Tsatsouline recommends two exercises in his book, one of them is a common exercise and the other is (not saying it won't work) a little ridiculous! I would recommend this book only to the beginner due to the fact that you have tremendous potential and will respond to ""any"" type of training (just get off the couch). They say that the spice of life is ""variety"", well wait til you try his workout(el boro! ). Save your money on this one, you can buy two quality books from the authors from above for the price of this garbage."
1,Wish I Could Give This Minus Stars,"Well, the good news is that it was only $2.99. The bad news is it is overpriced. The characters are shallow cliches, from the whiny, bride-to-be sister to the beautiful, too-hip friend to the unbelievably ridiculous parents. In fact, there is not a single person in the entire book who is likable or even remotely like anyone I would want in my orbit. I forced myself to finish it because I did not like the idea of just throwing away even $3, but that is my problem. You get what you pay for. I realize that there are far more positive reviews of this book than negative. But i just thought it was awful."
2,A Total Waste of Time...,"While the premise of the book is a new one, one that could have been quite interesting and entertaining, it sadly fell short of my expectations. The story needed more character and plot development. The more I read, the more cynical the tone of the book became. Disappointing read. Would not recommend it...move on to other worthwhile pursuits."
3,I don't know...,"Unlike usually it took me a long time to get through this book. The cover, the title, even the premise has so much potential and even the story line throughout isn't bad at all. It's just... Charlie and her friends were never very well developed. I never really felt for Charlie, for her plight. To me, the best developed character was Drew and he was only secondary. The entire book was just kind of blah. I followed it, but I never really got passionate about it.Unlike Emily Giffin's books this one just didn't pull me in. The story was good but the characterization never pulled me in, it seemed like nothing big ever happened. And there were some really cliche tacky lines/dialogue here and there. Not bad just nothing special, nothing I'd re read unless I wanted to reevaluate my opinion.Read it, sure, but don't be surprised if it's just a little whatever. I prefer Emily Giffin's books."
2,Did anyone proofread this?,"The story itself was ok, but I am shocked at the many mistakes and typos I came across in the Kindle version of this novel. There were ""1""s instead of the letter I, misspelled words, missing punctuation, horrible spacing, and even a random number 7 in the middle of a word. Maybe I'm a little more aware of things like this because I'm a teacher, but I think the mistakes are too obvious for anyone to ignore. This was my first Kindle book. Can I expect more mistakes like this in future novels?"
2,A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY,"I bought the book because it had some good reviews, however, the book is so predictable and boring. I couldn't get past the first chapter without yawning. It's a failed attempt at copying "" the devil wears prada"" so don't waste your $ and move on to a better book."
3,Entertaining concept,"I thought the concept for this book- The life of an assistant for a famous actor, would be lots of fun to read. Instead, the focus was the main character's angst about a lack of a love life, or what men thought about her. Though I enjoyed the book, a little more character development for her friends and boss would have flavored the story for me.I did enjoy the sage advice Grunenfelder delivers in the form of advice from the main character in the story to her future great-grand niece. So much of it was spot on, and made me smile.In all, was still enough to keep me interested, but not enough to call this a great book."
1,Larousse book from abookarama,"This dictionary was advertised as used, but like new. In fact, the spine was broken, the hard cover was bent and curled, and also scratched. I've attempted to contact Abookarama several times by phone and e-mail, but only have gotten a recording promising to call me back, which they have not done. For this I paid more than double for the same book in pristine condition through Amazon. I want to negotiate a new price or return it, but can't get the company to respond. I'm grateful for this purchese review opportunity."
2,"Good stories to start, but not the place for penis enlargement ads","The book starts out great. It has interesting stories and is interesting reading, HOWEVER, I did not expect or appreciate the advertisements throughout the book for the author's dating service, penis enlargement program, plans for building a shed, and many, many, many more. I might understand it from a free book, but not one that I paid for. I really think the main purpose was not to sell a book, but rather to sell an avenue to advertisements for the plethora of his other products and schemes.It does have interesting ER stories."
1,A disgrace to profession,"This is without a doubt the worst book I have read about emergency departments. The author comes across as a jerk and a disgrace to the profession. I don't know which is worse, his writing ability or his outlook on life. His rants about the poor are ugly and embarrasing. We all work under difficult conditions in emergency medicine, it comes with the territory. But if Pezzi wants to view his patients as animals, he ought to go into veterinary medicine. The donkeys would at least feel at home with him. Don't waste your money."
1,Vice City,"Vice city is an early GTA game that is set in the 80's. First of all, the controlls on this game are really bad. you can't aim the gun, it aims for you and it sometimes aims at the wrong person. All the buildings look the same and you get lost very easily. The missions are borring and frusterating espeacially when your character will not hit or shoot the person you want him to kill. Their is also no diversity of vehicles. Buy the Vice city stories, I found the controlls to be easier and I was able to complete the game, however the two best GTA games are san andreas and GTA IV (the new one)."
5,The best game i have ever seen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Perfect ! I know only to say that. The image graphics is perfect.Sound: Perfect . Gameplay: Perfect. I wanted to rate it 999999999999999999999999 stars.
5,GET IT NOW!!!,"If you still haven't played this game and fumbling around through reviews to decide whether to buy it or not, pay close attention to what I'm about to say: BUY IT!Most of the reviews here are true and that this is one of the best video games ever invented.To the rest of reviewers who are dissapointed that this game is just like GTA 3, I got only one thing to say to you: If it ain't broken, why fix it? GTA 3 was great, then why change it in GTA VC???And to the guy who edited Hillary's car to beat him in a race: SHAME ON YOU!!! Tommy Vercetti and I are very dissapointed..."
3,fun game that should be much better,"I don't know if the point-to-point timed missions just translate poorly to the PC version of GTA VC, but I found myself repeatedly playing through not fun elements of this thing that the programmers set as bars to opening up more options in the city. (The RC helicopter mission, boring to begin with, is virtually impossible on PC.)I enjoy a lot about this game, but the virtually exact port of the PS2 version to PC should have been tweaked a bit."
1,No Multiplayer. ...,"Don't buy this game. No multiplayer. What a slap in the PC community's face! ...It's the going to be the same ...game. Oh wait, better graphics (well, duh), and I can play my own MP3s. $hit, sign me up. That's worth 50 bones."
4,An interesting collection,"This book is an interesting collection of essays by authors who choose particular aspects of the Bible or of historical attitudes toward sexuality in the Bible. Some of the writers are quite well known and respected. The articles, as in all edited books, are mixed in the quality of their writing, but all offer interesting takes on the place of LGBTQ people within the spiritual makeup of humanity."
4,Give me the Word,"I have not read this book, but all I have heard is good things. My colleague Gil recommended it. It is about the Bible and Queer Theory."
1,Very Disappointed! :(,"My son got this for his second christmas. He was 20 months old. The springs on this horse were so stiff he couldnt do anything with it. You are supposed to push downwards with your weight and it ""inches"" forward. He couldnt do it at all. The only play he ever got out of it was climbing on and off it a few times. The sound maker (located at the horses face) fell out shortly after getting it also, and wouldnt stay in place. Sold it at a fleamarket for a couple dollars."
1,"Not a Marx original, rather a cheaply & poorly made knock-off","Was so excited to find this for my daughter. We had had one as children. Couldn't loosen it enough for her to bounce (she's around 30lbs, 2 years old) but she still liked sitting on it and pulling it around. We had to put it in bed with her (her new ""best friend""). On the 2ND day , the bolt and screw attaching the spring came off. Easy to fix ""if"" you could reach it. It's now sitting in a box , torso, legs , and head, awaiting jigsaw surgery. Save your money!"
3,Worth reading but just barely,"This collection of 6 stories was my first encounter with Miss Hildegarde Withers and John J Malone either solo or paired as in these stories. I was disappointed, but perhaps they do better in novel-length works. The plots range from fair to good. Characters are so-so. The dialog at times is excellent. Each story runs 24-29 pages, longer than my personal liking. Book has both an Introduction (by Ellery Queen) and a Preface (by Stuart Palmer) -- why?"
1,Ridiculous - Like watching a train wreck,This has to be one of the most worthless shows I have ever seen! It is like watching a train wreck. It is disturbing to see what adults will do to their children for a few minutes of fame.
3,sensa - nice pen,"Bought this pen because of the hype about the revolutionary gel.It was a nice novelty and received quite a few comments about it when it was borrowed.I liked it at first. It had a nice feel, but I ended up squeezing it too much that became uncomfortable. I believe that if the gel was a bit harder, it would have prevented that feeling of the pen being too skinny.The other gripe is the buildup of gunk at the tip when not in use. Almost every time I decide to use the pen, I have to find a scrap piece of paper to wipe the gunk off so it would not go on the paper I was writing on.Nice pen, but I think I will stick to the Rotring.If there was a pressurized refill that did not have this build up, the rating would definitely get 4 stars"
5,A Great Classic Western,This is one of the best Western TV shows ever made. It's very well acted and very true to how life would of been back in those days. It's always very exciting to watch. For anyone that likes Westerns this is a must have!
2,Ugliest Projects,"Although I found the instructions OK, I have never seen a book with such ugly projects, especially when there are some very nice pictures in the gallery that do not look too difficult. Every since the Carol Wilcox Wells books have come out, the bar has risen. Authors be aware!"
2,I must agree.......,this book is not worth purchasing for more than $2. The projects are boring and the gallery is small. I would also have liked to see some of the gallery pieces matched with a technique in a project.
1,Bacardi:The Hidden War,"Another Hit-Piece on the Cuban Exile Community(Like Cuba Confidential) people who are more pre-disposed to a Tyrant than a Democracy,and who through Manipulation and Revisionist History write books,Ocean Press which wrote a book on ""The mob"" in Cuba seems to be one of those pushing for the same aims as the murderous godless regime on the island,If you want to read a ""Balanced"" book on the story of Bacardi both behind the scenes as well as a bit of corporate History,Read Tom Gjelten(NPR of all places.) Bacardi and The Long Fight For Cuba A Biography of a cause,2008,Viking ISBN 978-0-670-01978-6. Now if your An Anti-Cuban Zealot knock yourself out reading this and other e x c r e m e n t."
4,Came recommended,Since reading New York dead I haven't any thing else int he Stuart woods collection. I really like this character.
3,Lacking the grabber,"Stuart Woods is and will remain one of my favorite authors; however, does his mind need to shift gears. ""Dirt"" seems to border on the paperback pulp fiction, gangster, police nickle novels of old. It's difficult to try to keep your attention on the content, when it bounces all over the pages. He always manages; however, to grab you enough toward the ending to keep you page turning and shaking your head and saying, ""well, I sure didn't see that coming. You need to read more than one of Woods novels to see where I'm coming from, but darned if you don't want to go to Amazon and purchase another one."
2,O.K Summer Read,"Woods has done better, no doubt, but it is still a fun, quick and engaging read, best suited for reading by the beach, pool or while otherwise engaged. I listened to the book on tape and found the narrator very good. Stone's ex-partner and his father-in-law the mob boss, are colorful but not believable, but neiter is Stone. Does he really have to have sex with every single female character in the book, including Dear Abby and the bad guys sister? What's with the Carrington/Barrington bit - kind of goofy. But anyone that picks up a Woods novel isn't looking for Shakespear are they? Its quick, fun and Stone, Carrington and the rest are generally likable characters. Not a tape for the kiddies!"
2,Not up to Stuart Woods quality,"I have read a couple of other books in this series and I was not impressed with this one. I kind of saw it coming from about halfway into the book. The ending was very anti-climactic and not up to the usual Barrington Stone quality. I think I'll continue in the series, but hope none of the others are like this."
4,Gets Better and Better,"Stuart Woods has quickly become one of my all-time favorite authors. After reading one of his novels, I decided to start at the beginning of his Stone Barrington series. I read ""New York Dead"" and then moved on to ""Dirt."" Woods does a great job of maintaining his character development of Stone, and Stone naturally grows into his role as a lawyer. I was not impressed with the book in the beginning, after several chapters the book got much better and went at a very fast pace. Definitely a good ending on this one too. I recommend this novel for anyone who likes series, but start at the beginning with ""New York Dead."""
2,Not happy with product,I love the look and color of the leaves but they are only 1 sided. What is seen from the other side of the window is white. That defeated the whole reason I purchased these. I wanted to display them in my windows so they could be seen from both the inside as well as the outside.
3,Bottom Seal,This is probably a good product but when I finally got around to opening the package I found that the included screws were too short for my door. I am not certain why this is but it is. I have purchased new longer screws and will see if they get the job done. The Seal was sent out promptly and other than being in two parts which I did not realize when ordering it was pretty much as advertised. The instructions that come with the product are weak which for the most part appears to be a common thing today.
1,Very disappointing,"I loved the original Blinx and coulnd't wait until Blinx 2 came out. I think I can sum up Blinx 2 with the following statement:Blinx 2 is the most confusing, incoherent pile of garbage ever foisted onto the gaming public.The story mode features a choppy story line that has you playing as the good guys one minute, then forces you over to the bad guys side for the next level. Game play features near-constant interruptions from the ""home base"", giving what is usually obvious and unnecessary advice.The views are hard to control and sometimes inadequate. Overall, this game was a huge disaapointment."
4,wonderful historical value,the sound is nasty but on this FRAU however where can u find CHRISTEL GOLTZ and ELEANOR STEBER.Incredible singing.Get it for the historical value as well as the fact that these singers were wonderful and not recorded very much.
3,Madam Zoltanne a Witch or Just Different,"Gallows hill by Lois Duncan was a mysterious book about a senior by the name of Sarah Zoltanne that is forced to move to a small town where the man of her mother's dreams lives, Ted. During her stay she meets a popular student named Eric that makes her cheeks rosy, and the daughter of Ted, Kyra, that puts the fury in her eyes. She also meets an over weight student, Charlie that turns out to be her shoulder to lean on. The suspicion starts when Eric uses his charm on Sarah and persuades her to be apart of the senior class carnival. She accepts the offer and turns into Madam Zoltanne. At the carnival Sarah used a glass paperweight as her crystal ball, and while she was telling fortunes cloudy visions appeared within the paperweight. Is she a witch, or just different? Read Gallows Hill by lois Duncan to find out what they did to her."
2,I didn't care much for this book.,"I have read all of Lois Duncan's books, on the cover of the paper back books. And this is one of my least favorite books. I thought that it was extremely boring and fell asleep in the middle of it. The plot was good and so were the intentions of the book. But still, it really bored me!"
5,Powerful,"As the first Lois Duncan novel I have read, this novel was brialliant with the writing and the way the author weaved in a powerful message. The book is about a high school girl named Sarah and how she overcomes many realistic things a girl must overcome and she learns a miraculous thing. The basic idea of the book is reincarnation (the theory of coming back to life with the same soul in a different body after you die). Mrs. Duncan does a fabulous job of weaving a fabulous subject with a most enthralling read.This is one novel that children,teens,and even adults would love. This is one of Mrs. Duncan's better novels and came out a true masterpiece. Buy and enjoy this novel for the ultimate reading experience that lies in your own desire. Enjoy this book and be sure to read more from the author.HAPPY READING"
4,"Another Innocent ""Witch""","Lois Duncan has done it again! She has written another amazing book that I could not put down. The new girl, Sara Zoltanne is asked to play the fortune teller in the school carnival, easy enough, right? Well not really. On the night of the carnival, Sarah is ready to go. She has her costume,booth,a crystal ball, and her soon to be stepsister as her source of information, What could go wrong? Everything's going well until she sees an actual vision in the ball. It's of the class clown Charlie Gorman being tripped and breaking his arm! Okay, not to worry, it's only my imagination she tells herself but when it actuakky happens, Sarah dosen't know what to think. This is the beginning of the end of Sarah's life as things get a whole lot worse before they get better."
1,Not Very Helpful,"I spent 3 months in Europe and can honestly say that I never used this book, not for lack of trying. In Germany, we needed to get gas and found how to ask what kind of gas the car required, however, no listing for the answers you might get to this question, i.e. ""diesel""! Some of the ""commonly"" used phrases, according to the authors, include ""I want to shake my dancing legs"" and ""I want to enjoy nature's calm"". Unless you frequently use these type of phrases, don't bother with this book."
1,"Frayed writing, needs polish","I found this book to be the perfect example of a book whose time has not yet come. Perhaps the had no other recourse than to go to a ""VANITY"" publisher. It needs editing, for the plot is convoluted and entangled in non-linear ways. The characters are soft and hollow. There is no ""fire"" here. It reads as if the writer merely typed it. A headless torso, says this observer. No sale."
1,Very Disappointing,"This book was an excellent idea, and the author seems to have had great access to the two main characters, Epstein and Ricciardi.But he blows it. The storytelling is really choppy. There are too many characters introduced - you have to keep turning back to remember who you're reading about. And he tries way too hard to turn routine events into memorable vignettes. He is not a good enough writer to pull it off, and the end result is this jumbled mess."
5,Great finish blade!,"I replaced an older Makita 12"" blade and would say that Dewalt is as good or better with the finish of the cut. Cuts right through various species of hardwoods and I like that. Very sharp excellent quality 80 tooth saw blade. I like the thin kerf, too. Recommended."
5,"FUN, Great choreo, not tricky to learn, TONS OF FUN!","Guillermo leads this fun 40 minute kickboxing routinein a nice open set with Asian styling. You won't need any equipment for this workout. The dvd also contains a 4 min kickboxing basics tutorial and a 10 min bonus martial arts drills segment.Guillermo does a fantastic job of really keeping things moving along, working up a great sweat, fun but NOT complicated or boring choreo, and his cuing is excellent.solid intermediate workout that is really appropriate for most all fitness levels- add some weighted gloves to amp up the intensity, or tone it down for a lighter day. Great cuing, great pace, lots of fun and the perfect balance of fun - not boring- not complex choreo."
2,BEWARE: These gloves run very SMALL,"I typically wear a medium & could barely get my hand in the glove. Go up one size, I need to return mine for a large (at least)."
3,"Good, decent usable set.","I brought one of these sets a few months ago, when they were available. Figured I would give my review after using this flatware.It looks good. Not expensive, or fancy, but nice. It washes good in the dishwasher, none of the pieces in my set have rusted or had any issues from the dishwasher.My only problem with this set, is that the Knives are too big length-wise. They are a half size bigger then normal, and don't even fit in my silverware draw. Otherwise this is a good economical set, if you can still get one."
4,Great bib!,These is a great item and I am very pleased with the purchase. They fit great and are perfect for a colder climate!
4,I like it,"The material can collect burrs which can be irritating. the overalls are very warm and comfortable, they fit well and hold up well"
5,Really good Crazy Horse,"If you love Neil Young with Crazy Horse, get this disk. It's Crazy Horse at it's grungiest. It's short but sweet. Nice companion to his solo live disk from same recently released collection...Why'd it take so long Neil? Just as the disc becomes a dying breed..."
2,con gusto a poco.....................,"esta edicion de los archivos realmente defrauda......es poco lo reflejado aqui.....la mitad de un gran concierto deja un gusto amargo, de obra incompleta...MUSICALMENTE es muy bueno.... pero........nada que ver con las series BOOTLEG de dylan, donde se advierte un gran respeto por el consumidor...una real obra de arte..en este caso, esta tan comentada edicion no deja de ser un fiasco, un ejemplo de egoismo e interes, por unas pocas canciones juntamos bastante dinerillo.....total los que amamos la musica del señor young podemos pagar cualquier precio por un souvenir asi..... creo que van por mal camino....esta presentacion de los archivos empezo muy pobre, muy poco digna en cuanto representa parte de un momento de la carrera de un musico exquisito...es tiempo de recapacitar y revisar las ediciones futuras..UN POCO DE RESPETO, POR FAVOR!!!!!!!!"
2,Great band but confused about the release.,"I gotta say this is amazing stuff, but I wish it was the whole show or at least enough to fill a CD, 43 minutes is kinda a ripoff. It's no wonder the record industry is sinking. I feel like ripping it and returning it. But what I find really disappointing and confusing is, on Neils site it says this is a DVD release w/photo montage of the show and that it is the 1st release from the archive series, the cover says this is release #2 not #1 and is only audio CD not DVD!!! I don't see any other version for sale. So as amazing as this band is, overall I gotta say this is a slap in the face for all of us old time fans who have been waiting for years to get our hands on this!!! Come on Neil- Give us a little more bang for our ever shrinking buck!!!!"
4,Good and Bad,"These are some well recorded performances that are a sizzling testament to the raw power of Neil when he plays with Crazy Horse. It's amazing that they sat in the can for this long. The package and the playing time smack of bargain bin though - 43 minutes? - C'mon! This is no bargain priced CD. The packaging and information is absolute bare-bones.Am I disappointed? You bet, but I'm a fool for Neil's early work, so I'll grudgingly buy the next one too. Hopefully, it'll be a better deal."
3,"Ok, paid my 23 bucks","This very short jam is ok by me, If you want a lot of material, this is not it. I wish I had downloaded this instead. Hard core fans will dig it. Enjoy America. Where is the rest of the show?"
2,"Crazy Horse? More like crazy ""Old Man""...","When I came across this new release in a record store, I was very surprised, to put it mildly. During the last Neil Young interview that I read, he said that the first Archives release would consist of 8 cd's full of great, old live shows including one showcasing ""Harvest"" in its entirety. So what's up with this rip-off?"
3,Bluprint - Foundation,"So smooth, it should be a yogurt drink. Foundation is Bluprint's first album, and it's warm and summery as July in Spain. There's some lovely strings and guitar on ""Mathis and Tetchner"" while ""Cross Park Soul"" adds some looped vocals for a wall-of-sound effect. It's all very... nice, which is to its detriment. The tracks are so mellow that the almost completely fade into the background; if you're looking for that sort of thing, say for coffee and biscuits after dinner, it's perfect. But the niceness doesn't achieve anything more than a jazzy ambience. It verges on the horror of ""lite jazz"" here and there, but a keen musical sensibility keeps it from completely succumbing. You can hear how easily a track like ""Answer Me"" could have gone wrong. Thankfully, it didn't, and the album as a whole doesn't."
1,it is just a poor cover,It is just a poor cover of Plumb's song ''Damaged'' (available from the ''Broken Palace'' soundtrack). It is a sad song on woman abuse. I hate it being turned into a cheesy dance song.
3,Choosing Up Sides,"I have strong reservations about this book. It is captivating, well written, a great story, but I think the cruelty is two heavy for the targeted audience. I don't like organized religion being lumped together as superstition for a group of readers who are not old enough to comprehend the many nuances of faith. I thought it was a great book for older readers but should be used with caution and lots of discussion for young readers."
5,The pros and cons of this book,"The con, first. I don't think this book should be used as a stand-alone guide. You should also buy one of those other fat books.The pro. This book builds your self-confidence, which I believe is the key to doing well on the exam. I've gone through about five different books, and none other has built my confidence more than this book. The authors' strategies are awesome. They show you the common pitfalls and traps to avoid. I loved it."
4,Another Winner From Cobra Verde,"Easy Listening is another winner from Cobra Verde. This band gets ""it"". What's ""it""? I haven't the foggiest idea. But you know ""it"" when you hear ""it"" and ""it"" is here, (as it is on all the other CV albums and most of J.P.'s Death of Samantha"" stuff as well). This Lp takes the best ""glam"" parts of their ""Nightlife"" Lp and mixes it with the harder rock crunch of their earlier releases, (Especially ""Vive Le Muerte""). Big rock guitars, melody, hooks, lyrically astute...Easy Listening is a can't miss."
5,A great lesser-known band,I've been a fan of Cobra Verde for a few years and have all of their previous CDs.This is their best one yet!There is not a bad song on it.Great guitar riffs and great lyrics! 100% solid! This CD gets my vote for one of the best rock recordings of the year.
1,Seriously? This is large?,"I purchased this for my small German Shepherd a month before Christmas. I was so excited for it to arrive because I really wanted to take pictures of him in this adorable outfit. I'd decided to order the ""large"" size because although he is a German Shepherd, he's probably the runt of the liter and I thought the XL costume may be too big, boy was I wrong. I took the outfit out of the package and was completely convinced that they'd sent me a small. The coat didn't even go halfway around him and I'm pretty sure the XL one would not have made a difference. The product page should really specify that when hey say ""large"" they really are talking about a large small breed dog! I was highly disappointed that we didn't get the product we expected."
5,Enlightening Movie of a true crime story,"The Onion Field is a true story by Joseph Wambaugh, a former policeman who knows of what he writes. The actors, especially James Woods actually looks like the killer he plays. Ted Danson is seen in his first major movie role, for only a short time, but an important character in the movie, which caused the LA Police Department to change it's rules about never ""giving up your weapon"" to anyone. It has a somewhat surprising ending, when you find out who is ""remembering"" the ordeal which is the basis of the theme of the movie, and how it affects his life. Joseph Wambaugh is at his best when he writes TRUE CRIME stories, such as this as well as ""The Blooding"", about the first time DNA was used to solve a case, which took place in England. He can hold you spell-bound."
3,"A uneven sometimes slow movie, but it's still good","I just saw this for the first time last week. I can now say I saw it; it's actually good, but often slow in spots, and hard to follow here and there. It's based on a true story of a LAPD officer murdered in cold blood, and his partner becomes a basket case because he didn't kill the suspects right after, and it leads him to mental breakdown where he's kicked off the force for shoplifting, and finally attempts suicide. Both roles were played rather well by John Savage who was nearing the end of his career, and Ted Danson before he became the bartender at Cheers. Also equally well performed was James Woods in his debut role as the murder suspect. It starts out slow, and picks up the pace, but unfortunately the ending I found rather weak. Still worth giving a look."
4,Sent the right Product!,"There was only one available from Amazon, so I had to find another vendor for a second brake drum. This one had an etched number on the edge and a balance weight welded on--This is correct. It is a good moderately priced brake drum, that does the job. The balance weight is important, because you can never get a wheel balanced to compensate for an imbalanced brae drum and your car will vibrate at speeds over 55 mph. I ordered the second one online from a well known vendor and got a brake drum in a Raybestos box with no balance weld and no numbers etched on the side. I knew right away that this brake drum was a knockoff probably from China. I called Raybestos to confirn this. Then I called the vendor and they offered so little resistance it made me beleive the vendor knew it was a knockoff, because they sent me a new one directly from Raybestos and did not even want to spend the money to have the knockoff returned. I have always got what was advertised from AMAZON."
2,A Word of Caution before purchasing this commentary,"I just recieved my copy of A Practical Commentary on Holy Scripture by Frederick Justus Knecht, and I was a bit disappointed. I was looking for a Commentary on each book of the Bible. This book is NOT a book by book commentary on Scripture. So, if that is what you're looking for, this is not the commentary for you.It is a more thematic approach on various subjects in both the Old and New Testaments; but it does not cover material from the writings of the Apostles, such a Paul, etc. It looks good as a Practical Thematic commentary.Just be sure what you're looking for before purchasing this one.-Fr Aidan Hix+"
3,About 16 Spots Shy Of A Hit,"Joe Public's success would be considered GREAT! for the brief time they were popular, but prior to all the 15 minutes of fame, they were doing back up vocals on Keith Sweat Albums. Their 1992 first release single, ""Live And Learn,"" hit a astonishing number 4 on the pop charts; listed number 39 for biggest hit of 1992, which most artist never break into to the top 100 spot. Their second release single was ""I Miss You,"" and it just missed the top 40, hitting number 55 on the pop charts in 92 and number 8 on the R&B charts. They followed up with ""Do You Every nite,"" and ""I've Been Watching You."""
5,Kentucky Christian,"A simple, and easy to read and understand, summary of the message of eternal salvation. This book explains why we are here and what we need to do to spend eternity with God."
5,"CD 'The Journey""",The Journey on CD came quickly and was just what I needed to read along with the book.
5,A really amazing book,"This was my first book on religion and it opened my eyes on faith, that its just not for sunday but its way to live your life, Mr Graham writes in such a fluid style that is so easy to read. Wonderful, superb book."
5,An excellent first novel,"This engrossing first novel is enveloping in it's tale of fear, dysfunction, family importance, forgiveness and redemption. The story flows effortlessly and sometimes uncomfortably into familiar life situations from McMillian, PA to Madacasgar. The characters are drawn convincingly and it easy to insert yourself into the shortcomings and solutions the characters face. If you read only the Prologue, you'll have a terrific read, but continue into this tale of passions and persuasions. Cherish the history and hope for a sequel."
3,Disappointed,"I've always looked forward to a new Susan Conant book - this was no exception. However, I was disappointed in its mediocrity.The the dogs were the best, the relationship with Buck great, the change in setting was interesting, , the plot was acceptable, Holly's memory loss was palatable, but the resulting relationship with Steve Delaney was unacceptable. It's okay to end relationships, but ....... This was not Ms. Conant's best work."
2,Creature Discomforts,"As a rule,I always love the books about Holly Winter,and her canine side kicks,Rowdy,and Kimi.I have read all of her books,and enjoyed everyone.Creature Discomforts,however,was a big disappointment.I really thought that it was long and drawn out more than it should have been.There were too many characters,not enough dog stuff,and Steve Delaney,has married a dog hating attorney.Holly was totally whimpy and out of character,the amnesia thing was hokey.I know you can do much better than this.I am a faithful fan,please don't disappoint me again. Bring back the Holly Winter we all know and love.Where was Kevin in this book? He was missed.Plus, Steve can't stay married to that dog hating person."
5,FOUR PAWS UP!,"SUSAN CONANT once again makes her characters and Alaskan Malamutes come alive as though all the two legged humans are sitting in your living room telling you their stories first hand, and the Malamutes are woo, wooing theirs! This book has a little different style of writing then Ms Conant usually does and keeps you riveted to the chair from the first page until the last! I highly recommend to any reader in love with dogs, no matter what breed, to settle in and enjoy a first rate reading experience!"
1,Writing in her sleep,I found this book to be very disappointing. Ms Conant and her heroine were both suffering from memory loss with this book. Not up to her usual standards
1,"POOR QUALITY, BREAKS",Minigrabber test leads broke within days of use. I used them to clamp on a wire 3 times and one of the leads snapped. Poor Quality item and I do not recommend.
1,Cheap junk,The metal clips in this test lead set are so soft they bent on the first use. I tried to save a couple of bucks and as usual it wasa mistake. Buy Ponoma and you will be much happier with the quality.
4,Banana to MiniGrabber Test Lead Set,I would have prefered this test lead set have silicone rubber insulation instead of plastic for greater flexability but it is what it is. These are a good set of test leads that work well and will serve their purpose for a long time.
2,not very useful,"The mini grabbers do not extend from the plastic sleeve very far, Makes it difficult to connect to a wire or terminal. Impossible to connect to some larger test points. Requires a lot of pressure to extend the tip so disconnecting creates too much pressure at the connection point. Very limited in usefulness. Would prefer the mini be a bigger mini."
2,"Good Concept, Cheap Construction leads to a Bad Unit","Product concept is good and simple. I like that you can plug other banana jacks into the back of the connector to piggy back another lead. Unfortunately on the one I got the minigrabber end came unsoldered almost immediately. Amazon offered a refund, but its not really worth the hassle for a cheap product. You get what you pay for."
5,Love this whole series,"Pathway Readers are the absolute best readers out there. Good, moral, Christian character enhancing stories. I use them with my children to read to me for homeschooling. I love them."
5,David Pogue Shines!,"The author takes you from the very basics, to the more complex subjects with ease and clarity. The writing is crisp, and very informative.I absolutely loved it, and what's more, I'm actually glad that Apple didn't include a manual with my new Mac, for David Pogue's writing is superb and in a league of its own!"
5,for my husbands old mac,He's older than Mac but he likes to tinker with old computers - this should help in his quest for old stuff.
3,Fair,"I disagree with a previous post claiming this book is a classic. It is not, but that doesn't make it a bad book either. To the contrary, I found this book provided good info on the various special operations forces it covered. I too was disappointed though to find Delta was not covered in this book. And the fact that the Pentagon still doesn't acknowledge them is a joke, everyone knows they exist, and there's plenty of pictures available of them and their gear so thats no excuse to exclude them. The author's portayal of those branches covered however was very good, making this book a mixed bag rating-wise."
5,Good Good Good,"Whaat a good one again.YOU just have to get all of her books if you enjoy reading of intrigue,family,love,connections ,just all the things that make our world a better place.She is super talented.I wish I could write like her.I'm author of Sharper Than A Two Edged Sword-It's my true story of a hard time in my life,can be found here on Amazon also.Nadia N.Rehmani"
2,No new information here,"The Play the World Strategy Guide is nothing more than a printed version of the Civlopedia, which is included with the game. The ""strategies"", if we call them that, can be summed by saying: ""win the game"". The manual reminds players to keep the end objective of winning in mind, but provides zero guidance on how to get there. Anyone with a week of playing experience could probably right a more insightful look into the game."
1,No microphone capability,"I was just about to order this tape recorder, when I noticed there is no way to plug in a microphone, which would make it worthless for me. If it has a mic jack, I sure can't see it in the photo, and there is no mention of one. Hard to believe they could leave something that essential off it. Glad I noticed it in time and saved the hassel of having to return it."
4,Good quality deck.,Razor sharp sound. Intuitive smooth opperating controls. Handsome face plate. The only draw back is that it does not produce output sound while recording.
2,"Interesting premise, poor excecution","I just couldn't really find it in me to really like this book. It has a good setup, with the ancient teachings of the sith beginning to trickle back into the galaxy, provoking an all-out war in the next volume, but way the characters are handled isn't very well done. Characters do things that just don't make sense. Ulic decides he must turn to the dark side to learn the secrets of the sith, but why? Considering that Ulic and his friends just defeated a Dark Lord much more powerful than the current threat, Ulic's decision isn't something the reader understands and symathizes with, it's simply a heavy handed plot device. A similar lackadasical approach to the characters and their decisions is taken throughout the story, with apprentices disobeying their masters for no good reason and overlooking basic options. The artwork is OK, but overall, I think Dark Lords of the Sith doesn't function well as a Star Wars story."
4,A DVD review,"This movie is definitely a sleeper. The DVD left a lot to be desired though. Some dust floaters mostly noticeable in scenes with a lot of sky. The sound was adequate although some of the dialogue seemed mumbled. The soundtrack was clear and bright. The 'making of' featurette was more like an extended trailer about 15 minutes long. Not much in terms of bonuses are included, no subtitles. The trailer showed short snippets of scenes that were cut and it would have been great to have them included in the features. I keep this DVD in my collection for the great cinematography and color."
2,Smells great but.....,I love love love the smell of soy milk and was very disappointed with his body butter. It is really not moisturizing and does not go on smooth at all. Very disappointed. This may be why they have one called body soufflé now.
2,Kind of boring...,"When I started the story is seemed slow and just got slower. Bud, or Buddy, is a bad tempered, horse racing, angry, young con artist who is asking for trouble. At least that is how I see him. The story is more like a series of events that kind of don't go together and you wonder what the whole point of the story WAS? It makes me wonder why a female author, B. M. Bower, is writing from the point of view of a male character? Why not the female point of view?Zane Grey this is not and, frankly, a bad Zane Grey is better than a good any other western author, including this one.DON'T waste money and TIME on this book. Too bad nobody else had a review on it before me, maybe I could have saved myself the read."
5,Amazing product bought from Amazon,"I first bought this product in Seattle after I had been bitten by mosquitoes .It was just amazing. It took the sting out immediately, and the swelling went down within an hour. I have used it on cold sores and it works, on irritated skin and it works....the list is endless. The only draw back is I can't buy it in the UK. I have to import it, at great expense from USA, but I am prepared to do this as it is such a wonderful product.Give it a try, you will be astonished at its uses."
5,Life changing!,"This book was exactly what I (a person who has these exact problems) was looking for. It has put into words what I could not, and showed me how to correct long-standing behaviors. It is well written, both for a lay-person like myself, or a therapist. Give it a read!!"
5,Multi-ethnic and educational three part essay about women,"This three part anthology of stories is diverse yet at the same time amazingly connected as are women of all walks of life worldwide. The author's outlook and uncanny knowledge of women shows both stark candor and renewed hope for our future as females.Mama Creole: Excellent descriptive language - really gives the flavor of the story. An encouraging example of a strong and loving-kind woman for our troubled times.Triple Threat: A total change of pace - lots of surprises!Gendercide: A look into this troubling phenomenon of gendercide. Insightful, clearly a part of the author's experience. Frankly written with passion and compassion.An overall superb and entertaining book, yet very thought-provoking and at times even distressing. The author has succeeded in invoking the reader's deepest emotional response."
4,My Pyle Turntable,I have some problelms getting this to work as I expected it to. But it is coming along for me.
2,Disappointing buy,"I had high hopes for The Pyle PLTTB1 but was immediately disappointed from the very beginning. The turntable was unable to play a new record without getting stuck multiple times. I purchased this unit because of the adjustable tone arm and other features it offered. In the end, I shipped the unit back and purchased the Audio-Technica that was at a similar price point which worked well. I would not recommend the pyle."
2,In Black & White,"Disappointing. Not a single color photo in the entire book. While ""The 400 Story"" by Jim Scribbins has only a few color photos, it has an absolute wealth of information and is a better buy. The '400' fleet of the 40s and 50s had black roofs not green ones as so many think. You wouldn't know that from this book."
1,"Heavy duty Jar, Wrong size top for lid",I ordered this for my blender jar that broke. Got jar but wrong size lid top. Pretty much useless to me.
3,"OK, but Not Great","I bought this watch as a present... it came very fast. But, the battery was dead, and it looked used/a return (no wrap package). Otherwise, so far it works OK. But the seller I doubt very much..."
5,Ratt at their best.........,"This is Ratt's best album from the 80's. I had this tape back in the day, but I didn't really appreciate how good it was. I just gave it another listen, along with their other releases. This album is great. The songs here sound a lot like the ones from ""Out Of The Cellar"", but just more refined. It's like they knew what they were doing now. Ratt had found their sound and we going to perfect it. This is the result of that. There are no bad songs here. For example, I just made a Ratt 2-disc hits collection and I used eight songs from this album. That was the most from any Ratt album. ""You're In Love"", ""Never Use Love"", ""Lay It Down"", ""Give It All"", ""Closer To My Heart"", ""What You Give Is What You Get"", & ""Got Me On The Line"" are all excellent tunes. The rest are pretty good, as well. I don't give five stars to CD's that don't deserve it. Trust me......this one does. Buy it."
3,californation,It was sometimes blurry but other then that was good. I would recommend it to anyone who asked me if it was worth buying.
5,Great Show,"I really enjoy this show very funny, the cast is great and always leaves you wanting more. Can't wait to see the next season."
1,This show is losing its quality,The first two seasons were the best. This season was full of grown men acting like 20 something year olds parading around town with young beautiful women. All the while their one liners are getting old and tired. The one actress who seemed like the only grown up on this season was Karen. The story lines were weak silly and just plain boring at times. Stop while you're ahead and end this series so the fans will remember the good episodes.
1,Burns On Both Arms,"I like one of the previous reviewers received serious burns on both arms, also bled from one. Both arms are now medicated and wrapped with a sterile bandage."
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun!","This book is so great. It takes you through centuries and decades of fashion. Pictures are fantastic. Personally, I thought the paper a little grainy for good coloring, but still worth purchasing, and even re-purchasing! Since I use only colored pencils, the surface of the paper may not be an issue for you if you use different medium. Since there is only one picture per sheet of paper, it's easy to use paint, markers or watercolors as well. One other thing I don't like is that the explanatory note for each picture is on the back of that sheet--it would be nice if it were on the same page, or at least the facing page. Regardless of that trifling detail, this is a fun and exciting book to color. Buy it without hesitation!"
5,Relaxing....,I love love love these coloring books! My favorite thing about these books is that are good enough to frame when you done with the picture!Colored pencils work best on these books!!Relaxing coloring book for adults!!! I'm a mom of 2 and at the end of the day this is my escape...Recommend to all adults ...men and women!Please let me know if my review helped you in your purchase !
1,HORRIBLE! DO NOT GET!,"This is the [...] thing i've bought in my buying history!the only good thing about it is that it came with a jump!the engine was EXTREMLY LOUD!you have to have a really light car to do it, but it cannot be to light so you have to pick the perfect car.and it is boring! the preview i saw made it look so cool!to conclude, [...]"
1,This Item has been recalled and is illegal to sell or re-sell in the USA,"I thought it was a great sling. But since there has been a recall, it should not be sold from Amazon or craigslist or a garage sale even."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought the Hip Hammock when my child was 6 months old. I absolutely HATED this product. It is not user friendly and my child did not enjoy being in it at all. I'm not a large person, but I found out very quickly that it was not a comfortable fit and it put a lot of pressure on my neck. My best advice is to invest in a ""cheap"" compact stroller and use that. I find it much easier to put my child in and out of a stroller.The Hip Hammock is overpriced...don't buy it!!"
2,Buy an Ergo!!!!,This was not what I thought it would be- I should have done my research first and went straight for my Ergo--- which I love!
5,Love the Hip Hammock,"It's been an ongoing search for the right carrier, and it has ended here. My son is 81/2 months old, tall and thin and sprouted right out of the baby bjorn... but this hammock gives him freedom of upper body motion and myself a necessary break for my back. The only problem is that it's TOO compact to carry around and I left it at a restaurant! If it were bulkier I wouldn't have forgotten it! (LOL)It's easy to put on when unassisted, compact, lightweight, comfortable, unobtrusive in a crowd, safe, and comes in basic black... which accessorizes beautifully! Buy two and give one to a friend."
1,SO NOT WORTH IT!!!,I bought this for my 13 month old and she hated it and it dug into my collar bone. I am not a very tall person but my husband is a lot taller and he felt the smae way about it. I returned it 20 minutes after buying it. The store salesman said that about 30-40% of them have been returned.
3,Made in China,"My old Makita, which I absolutely love, was made in Japan and/or the USA. When my new Makita saw arrived, it was made in China. It is a really nice saw but some of it is cheap, like the handle grip on the top. I would not have ordered it if I had known where it was made just because I have not found the quality to be as good from China. There is too much cost cutting by executives seeking to boost their stock option bonus by shipping jobs and quality overseas plus I like products made by the USA or it's allies. Silly me."
3,I recognized some of the cast.....,"This film seemed pretty campy to me. Some of the acting appeared overdone. I just didn't much care for it, even though the period was a source of exhaustive study for me."
2,Christopher Plummer is just weird,"Terrible transfer, badly cut, chopped, savaged - a lot like Atahualpa himself, played by Christopher Plummer using some improbable modern invention of the high chirruping sounds of the ""ancient Incan language of the sun kings."" It's hard enough taking Chris for the Inca, let alone taking him seriously as a bird. Everyone walks about looking mildly amused and very theatrical. Too bad, because it's a brilliant play and could be wonderfully and powerfully filmed - or, not."
3,"Good price, heavy metal, hard for my fingers","Nice hunk of very heavy metal, but I found it nearly impossible to turn the valves, therefore it didn't work out for me. I don't want to keep a tool near the faucet or in my pocket to use the water."
4,Storm in a Rain Barrel by Anne Mather (Large Print Softcover),"Description from the book back cover:When her guardian and only relative, Great-Uncle Henry Farriday, died, Domine Grainger was rather daunted to learn that he had arranged for her to be looked after by the unknown James Mannering until she reached the age of eighteen. Still, that was only six months away, Domine consoled herself - not knowing that they were to be the most difficult six months of her life ..."
2,dim lignts,"The lights seem good, but there are even dimmer than the originals car came with.the colors are ok but the intensity is poor.I don't think there is much diferece between this ones 6000K intensity than the much cheaper version on the market."
1,not enough detail,"There are better north carolina atlas books that you can buy, don't chose this one pick another."
3,Too American in content,"Too American in content, and abit old while some of them cant even be termed 'classics'. However, all things considered, can be a good resource book for the genre"
1,"Read 2 Pages, Not edited, poorly written","I have only gotten through 2 pages and have encountered so many editing mistakes. It is written at a very low writing level. I will continue reading to see if the material is worth while, despite all the distractions.For example, a sentence that I ran into when I fist started reading was: ""I'll get in may car to go to a place that I work, which is about an hour away in the next state, and not consciously remember anything that transpired between the time I pulled out of my driveway and into the parking lot of my destination.""The sentence structure it very awkward to read and the ""may"" instead of ""my"" is something that editing would of caught. I got through a few pages and found so many of these.I tried to read more of this book but I don't think it has anything useful to offer. If you like to edit people's writing then go for it!I would recommend getting a different book."
3,Just A Correction,"George Martin wasn't the manager of the Beatles, he was their producer--big difference. The only bonafide ""group manager"" Fab Four ever had was Brian Epstein. But after the Beatles stopped performing live he really didn't have much to do, but the boys needed a business manager, so they ended up hiring the rather crooked Alan Kline. George Martin produced their recording sessions, and had nothing to do with the business of the Beatles.There really is not a very good Beatles documentary--it is yet to be produced. Both The Compleat and The Anthology are just historical chronologies that lack any real focus. The story of the Beatles is a lot deeper and far more interesting than has been told in either of these documentaries."
4,Electricity Backup,If the power goes out it is a nice back up for lights.Also the air compressor is great for the kids bikes.
5,Showed this classic to my kids...they loved it!,"Its amazing how this film holds its value in today's society. Although the cold war is history, the world is still torn with strife and war and the lessons of this old movie are as current as ever. The film is still fun to watch and will live on."
5,Best Sci-Fi movie ever,"This is a classic Sci-Fi space movie with a great sound track. The odd ""scary"" sounds were made with a Theramin, a special instrument made by the father of electronic music, Bob Moog. Bob designed the Mini Moog and other classic synthesizers. (He died recently but his legacy lives on)"
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though not as good as its reputation would indicate, TDtESS is asimple, effective story that overcomes sometimes-poor special effects (note the strings when Gort lifts Patricia Neal) and inane dialogue (Klaatu barada nikto) to deliver numerous effective scenes and a powerful message."
4,Great Movie,One of the all time classics. Everyone should see this movie at least once. The remake with Keaneu Reeves - not so great - but - this one is a classic that will stand the test of time.
5,There must be security for all or no one is secure,"This black and white classic from 56 years ago tells as much about our society even now as the CGI and monkey cam films of our current day and age.Klaatu (Michael Rennie) came to Earth with a simple message. Space travel makes the universe smaller and what one race does eventually harms everyone. So, Earthlings be peaceful--or else.Unfortunately, a soldier too quick on his trigger finger shoots him just as his space ship landed on the mall in Washington, DC. Klaatu escapes US military custody and goes out to evaluate humanity on his own.""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" shows earthlings at our best and worst. It's such a simple film, no color, very little in the way of effects, and yet the starkness has a strength and beauty we seldom depict in today's films. Great message, great film. I'm very glad to have the opportunity to see it."
4,Good Classic,This is another classic movie to add to our collection. We love these old movies to watch with a bowl of popcorn.
3,The cold war went on for about 40 years after this movie came out,"They are remaking this with the Matrix Messiah actor asKaltu, the alien. One really doubts that the warningwill have any more effect in the current age than itdid in the past? Peace is not a message that politiciansand general want to heed?We are literally cooking ourselves and our planetand no external alien message is going to wake us up?!"
1,WHY ARE THE WIRES STILL THERE?,This a review of the blue Ray disk....this is not about the movie per say. It is about chapter 81 when Patricia Neal is being carried to the saucer by Gort AND THE DAMN WIRES ARE STILL VISABLE!!!!! WHY???? WHY COULDN'T THEY GET RID OF HER WIRES? wHAT IS THE PROBLEM? IT RUINES THE ENTIRE MOVIE!!!! SHAME ON YOU PEOPLE FOR DOING THAT TO US!!!
5,Classic,It's one of the early greats and still holds up after all these years. A simple story but hits the nail on the head concerning mankinds paranoia.
2,"Oh, well, at least it was only $1.49","There were some redeeming qualities to this disc as far as cinema history(although not enough), and it was nice to see the young Ali McGraw(and a glimpse of Sharon Tate inThe Fearless Vampire Killers, or Pardon Me but Your Teeth Are in My Neck, but any reason why this was released escapes me, except as a fundraiser or ego stroke for Robert Evans. It's like some piece of dreck from the those serious journalists at the History Channel or A&E;, except it's told in the 1st person. Thank God that we didn't have to hear Evans spout off about being a victim and suffering from the ""disease"" of cocaine. It was about twice as long as was needed to get the point across."
4,Great doc. Totally worth owning,"Producer legend Robert Evans is the subject for and narrator in this wonderful documentary of the classic ""rise and fall"" variety. This is just a really vibrant and dynamic film, and really seemingly raises the bar for biography documentaries. Evans himself narrating is funny and self-recriminating about his past, and by the film's end, one really feels to have a better understanding of the time period as well as Bob Evans himself. The way the film plays with moving around still photos kinda spells out the entry of the flash/photoshop generation into film, and this is not such a bad thing, at least in this genre. Film fans will adore this, everyone else will really enjoy it. The extras feature some of Bob's acceptance speeches upon receiving lifetime achievement awards from various sources, and are well worth a look."
4,"Perfect for Beginners in Violin and other ""C"" instruments","This fake book has all of your favorite hymns in the key of ""C"", with easy-to-read large music notation, simplified chords and includes all of the verses for sing along. It is perfect for beginners and has a binding that will lay flat on the music stand. All the well-known verses (including multiple) are included under the notes. Finally, unlike other fakebooks that try to crowd several songs together in one page, or split them between pages, this book fits one song per page with large readable type."
4,great for varied hymns in a pinch,This book has been a lifesaver for playing at church. Easy hymns although not quite as full sounding as straight from the hymnal.
4,Gotta Gotta try a little tenderness...,"Ah, this is part of my lovely guilty pleasure group of 80s/Brat Pack movies. A little John Hughes is wonderful sometimes and makes for a great movie night... On to the review:I really, really want to give this 5 stars, but can't bring myself to do it. The plot is just too off for me. The whole rich/poor thing is an odd premise, and he asks her to prom after one date? Plus, the predictability of it all is so sickening. And Duckie... my poor poor Duckie.The acting in this movie is great for the most part. The supporting cast especially. Jon Cryer and Annie Potts made this movie. And if only James Spader didnt look 30, I would say he was perfectly cast as well. Ringwald and McCarthy did alright with their parts, not great, but not badly either. I also thought this script lacked something other John Hughes movies seemed to have. It just didnt grasp me as much. Basically, this is a good movie to watch on a movie night with the girls."
2,well at least it was Pretty in Pink,"so why tell us we would finally see Duckie get the girl & let us down again! this is not the Duckie version it is the why Mollie Ringwald did not want Duckie to be a love interest because she was not attracted to him explaination. Well, I still love Duckie & so does everyone else who clammerd to by this mistitled DVD!"
5,A great 80s movie,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I've watched it over and over again and am glad to have found it at Amazon to purchase it. It is well acted. I love the interactions between all the characters. ""Ducky"" is hilarious. ""Andy"" is real and ""Blane"" shows us that peers can influence us in a sometimes negative way. This is one movie that I'll never tire of watching. It lets you know that it doesn't matter if you have money. It's being happy that counts. It brings back a lot of memories. You won't go wrong by purchasing this movie. Enjoy!"
4,Pretty In Pink!,"I just saw this movie 4 the 1st time this weekend, I liked it a lot, it was on right after the movie sixteen candles, so it reminds me of that movie since the main girl is also in that movie too, anyway, this is a great movie. Its an older one about a girl who is poor and not very popular who has a popular rich guy crushing on her."
5,Great 80s movie,"I was a teenager in the 80s and like many kids of that era LOVED THIS MOVIE! It most definitely is a classic 80s movie! In any case I let my own kids watch it and they thought both the hair and clothes styles were old and funky, does that make ME Old and funky I sure hope not because those were some of the best years of my life! And that 80smusic, that was when music was music and not noise like it is today! In any case I LOVED THIS MOVIE but you'd really have to be from that 80sera to appreciate it!"
4,lower price,"I found this in a lower price in my town at 30.00, plus they had a bigger stock of it then anyone here on amazon"
4,Really enjoyable,Tony still has it. His CD is a wonderful compilation of songs and voices. Very positive.
2,Too Much Noise,Very noisy - should have more of the slow sexy type of music we love hearing from Tony Bennett.
5,Great Album,"I really enjoy the CD and find it relaxing and uplifting to listen to. Tony's voice just gets better with time. He has the biggest names as duet partners. Most songs are great the first time through, others had to ""grow on me"", but I enjoy them all except the one with Paul Mccartney. He just doesn't fit that kind of music. Enjoy the playfulness between Tony and his partners."
5,Duets: An American Classic,"I bought about a half dozen to give as Christmas gifts and everyone, without exception, loved this CD."
2,Duets,Disappointing. I gave it away to the same person I gave the Viva Duets CD to. I just couldn't get into it.
2,"just ok,","Tony Bennett is one of my all time favorite vocalists,but this collection is tired. there are a few folks on here who can carry a tune,but come on Tony Bennett doesn't need any help with his instrument. Tony Bennett is a Singer's Singer&he isn't matched on here at all. I understand the marketing&the mind set at putting this together,but nothing on here matches the richness that is found in Tony bennett's voice.if Tony Bennett didn't still bring it then I'd give this collection a solid One because it just ain't happening."
1,Big Disappointment,"I'm a big Tony Bennett fan, but this CD is a huge disappointment. Almost every duet pairing and song selection is uninspired. And the schmaltzy strings and most of the arrangements are just terrible. The whole thing seems like a poorly executed marketing project. The duet with Diana Krall is probably the best cut on the album."
5,Tony and friends,"The late,legendary Frank Sinatra did it,Elton John did it and now Tony Bennett does it. Here is a great collection of duets that even senior citizen fans will love(those who were fans of Bennett since his career began in 1952). Country fans will love the track with the Dixie Chicks,but it's not country style. The one with Billy Joel is nice,very similar to Joel's self-penned recording of BABY GRAND with the late Ray Charles. Joel's recording of Leonard Cohen's LIGHT AS THE BREEZE has a similar style also. There are other great songs featuring the moral support of EJ,Sir Paul McCartney,George Michael,James Taylor and others. The ""duet for one"" is a re-recording of Bennett's 1962 hit I LEFT MY HEART IN SAN FRANSISCO. Another reviewer mentioned that the track didn't need any human accompaniment. The other songs are great!"
5,Duets: An American Classic,"It was great to hear him sing with some of the greats. Tony is still doing pretty good, but I hope he knows when to quit. Some stars do not."
5,Great Music,"A wonderful Tony Bennett CD with great guest artists. Some may be slightly like a fish out of water, but still great music. The arrangements are beautiful and the orchestra is wonderful."
5,Niles VCS100R Volume Control,I have 4 of these volume controls installed and they work great. There's no humming or clicking when you change the volume up or down. Great product---will buy more for the house.
2,2 1/2 stars,"I liked the story, however, there were some issues I had with the theme of the book.Emily, Olivia's blind sister, is incredibly shallow. She goes on and on about how she wishes she knew what her admirer Andre looked like and that she hopes he's very handsome. She's blinded (no pun intended) by her hatred for the gypsy who killed her father, so much so that when she finds out Andre is a gypsy she tells him she hates him.Olivia was kind of weak, never telling Dominic that she doesn't fear him because he's a gypsy, but because he stirs desires within her she has no idea how to handle. She coddled Emily far too much, even if she was blind.The mystery came from nowhere. I don't even remember any mention of how the two main characters even know the villain. The last scene of Olivia and the two children being rescued was flat, and how he was captured was just incredulous.James has written way better than this. I think it could have been a good book, but the characters failed."
1,Way too small,"I was very disappointed when I saw the accessory. It is way too small. It just hold my cell phone, and a pen."
3,"""adjustable straps""","The quality of the tote bag is good but the ""adjustable straps"" are way too short for the arm of my Invacare power chair."
4,Good guide to the internal workings of a radio,"I am ham radio operator. It had been years since I had dabbled in building a radio so found this book. I built the radio as I went through the book. It helped me successfully transition from tubes to transistors and integrated circuits. Now I have a great radio and know how to troubleshoot it when it has problems. Armed with the technical and conceptual knowledge I gained from this book, it is easy to understand circuitry in other ham radio gear, making it possible for me to do my own repairs."
2,Ten Bucks,Why do so many of us need to spend ten bucks to be told to get off our butts?It's not that this book is worth less than that....that's not the point. If you are buying this book you already know what is in it.Put it down and get up and go out there.It's actually fun.
5,This is a book with substance,"I agree with most of the other reviewers below that this is a fantastic book. Often these types of books are pretty ""fluffy"" and don't help too much. I've been pleasantly surprised, however, as each section of this book has legitimately helpful information. I feel as though I've learned a lot and been reminded of a lot of things I once knew. I recommend the book to anyone who has a vague idea that his life isn't turning out like it should but isn't quite sure what to do about it. It will help you as you try to figure out what to do and give you the courage to do it."
2,What's Next? Shiny Happy People?,"I was so looking forward to this CD. I thought this band could do no wrong. Bright Lights and Antics are masterpieces, Our Love To Admire comes nowhere close. This Album sounds recycled and almost produced for the masses. It reminds me of when REM changed trains and headed for mass appeal. I wonder if Carlos D is going to appear on Sesame Street? Hopefully, this is just a bump in the road for this great band. I am looking forward to the next album. As for Our Love to admire, I am going to add it to the list of used discs for sale here on Amazon."
2,what direction are they going?,"i liked ''bright lights'' and i liked ''antics'' but, this release is just too much of a departure from the previous two. i beleive their ship is now taking on water. absolutely no upbeat songs, the songs just drag on and on, this release will probably have some sales riding the coattails of the first two but, the next release will definately be a hard sell.and the used bin is filling up pretty fast."
2,Disapointment,"This CD is like meeting a beautiful woman and finding out she's your sister. The fist song, Pioneer to the falls, is one of their best. Unfortunately, the rest of the CD simply does not live up to the first song's standard. I hope this is not a trend with Interpol. Each new album is not as good as the one it replaced. I once called this group a revelation. After this CD, I'm not so sure."
2,Booooorrrriiinnnngggg,"This album starts off very strong with the first song, Pioneer to the Falls. It is one of Interpol's best songs, but the rest of the album is pretty bad. It pains me to say that because Interpol has been one of my favorite bands for a number of years. This album is plain boring, and it shows that this band is stuck in neutral. They are not progression. At this point in their career they should be getting better, not worse. I would not recommend this album to a friend. I would go with Turn on the Bright Lights or Antics. I still hold out hope for a good album next time..."
1,A GOOD CD TO HELP YOU FALL ASLEEP AT NIGHT,"HOW CAN A PERSON PUT OUT A CD IN 2006 WITH ONLY 10 SONG'S ON IT.THAT'S WHAT THEY DID BACK IN 1986 IT IS JUST OVER 45 MINUTES.IF A CD HOLD'S 80 MINUTES FILL IT TO THE MAX AND GIVE PEOPLE THERE MONEY'S WORTH!.THIS CD BY BEYONCE IS ONE OF THE MOST BORING CD'S I HAVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.IT DOES HELP ME FALL ASLEEP AT NIGHT THOUGHT BECAUSE OF HOW BORING IT IS.BEYONCE IS A VERY TALENTED & BEAUTIFUL PERSON BUT SHE IS GOING FULL SPEED AHEAD.THAT MEANS SHE WILL THROW OUT ANYTHING TO MAKE SOME MORE $MONEY$ AND THAT'S WHAT THIS CD IS;SOMETHING TO MAKE SOME FAST CASH.THAT'S WHY IT ONLY TOOK HER TWO WEEK'S TO MAKE IT.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD JUST WATCH HER VIDEO'S ON MTV AND VH1 AND IT WILL DO YOU JUST FINE.{ROME,NEW YORK}"
3,"I give her an ""A"" for effort....","I don't feel that this was really a work of art, but I do commend her for being bold and taking music to another level. When you hear a song on the radio you can't get it mixed up with another beat, because all of her songs are very unique. I am a true Beyonce fan still I feel she could have done better. But my fave is ""Upgrade U."" She speaks a lot of real stuff in that song. All women w/ that #1 man should listen and really understand this song. It's not a put down but a boost up. He's already #1 but she wants him higher. That should be her next single and I'm sure she would get even more sales."
1,"B-DAY--Horrible... Appalling, Awful, Dreadful, Herrondous","I expected much better from Ms. Knowles, the POP princess. I refused to purchase this album after I listened to it for free at AOL music. I will not waste my money!!!"
3,It's O.K.,"Upgrade U is my favorite song from this album, simply because I do my cardio workouts listening to this song. Wasn't really feeling any of the other tracks they are o.k. in my opinion but I wouldn't say that they sting."
3,Beyonce CD,"Love her music, however some of the songs on this ""new"" CD had too much static and not very clear. Sounds like an old 45. Came with 2 CD's. The Spanish one sounds incredible, I was pleased with that one."
2,It's not my day,at first listen i didn't care this cd. after a few more time listening to it it grew on me at least the music her voice not so much. this cd is what i call semi-listenable because the music is fun but her voice is not she sounds like every song has to be a sung as if it's life or death and I know she can do better and has so if you need something to make you wonder why i did or doing what i am doing my listening to this will help how i don't know but it will distract you from your problem and ask what with her.
2,"Needs an ""Upgrade""","This album was a real let down from Dangerously in Love. You'd expect a more mature, grown sound, still without alienating her younger fan base. Yet instead we got remedial Destiny's Child lyrics circa ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" & ""Bugaboo"". Sure, you can dance to most of the tracks; great club beats. But for all that she is hyped up to be (the next Diana Ross), she needs an ""Upgrade"" HERSELF."
2,Disappointing,"I have to admit that I really like 'Deja Vu' - I know a lot of people hated the song/video but I think it grows on you after a bit. The rest of the album, well...you can tell that this was recorded in (what did she say?) 3 weeks? There's a serious lack of catchy songs that can be put out as singles. The best part of the album is at the end with the slower songs like 'Irreplaceable' and 'Listen' (which I'm sure is B's attempt at an Oscar nomination for 'Dreamgirls'). Her vocals are strong no doubt about it but the songs are lacking in creativity. And 'Ring the Alarm' is a weak song...has she gone mad? She really seems like a lunatic throughout the song. The performance on VMA for the song seems like a blatant take-off on 'Rhythm Nation' doesn't it? She might outsell Janet but Janet's new album is MUCH better than this one, sorry B..."
1,. . .,"From the description, I see that this is simply the Best Buy version of the B'Day Deluxe Edition. It doesn't have ""2 bonus tracks"" as it claims, it only has one. ""World Wide Woman"" is a hidden track after ""Listen"" on all the regular versions of the album, so it is not a bonus. The only real bonus track is ""First Time,"" which is the same song as ""My First Time"" from the bonus disc of Beyonce's Live At Wembley DVD. It's a b-side from her debut album. It was produced by The Neptunes, but it's really nothing special.The album is excellent. It is my favorite album of all time. But the point of this review is there really is no point in buying this if you already have B'Day Deluxe Edition. And it's absolutely pointless if you have the DVD I previously mentioned."
2,Refund,"Honestly this record was a disappointment. I was looking for a cd of good tracks and thats not what I got. Overall it wasnt Beyonce to me. I'm a fan but she was talking from someone else's voice and when its your cd, speak from your own voice. She shouldve spoken from her character's voice in the soundtrack to Dream Girls, not on her record."
3,AVERAGE SOME GOOD & BAD,"ALBUM IS MORE ENJOYABLE TO LISTEN THAN THE 1ST SOLO EFFORT. THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH JAY-Z ENOUGH. THAT'S WHY IT'S 3 STARS. BEYONCE IS A TALENTED SINGER BUT SHE HAS BETTER SONGS WITH DESTINY'S CHILD. HER VOICE IS NOT SUITED FOR SOLO WORK. ALL ARTIST HAVE BAD ALBUMS OR A BAD ALBUM AT SOME POINT, LOOK AT MADONNA, WHITNEY & MARIAH. SHE ONLY HUMAN AND YOU CAN'T PLEASE ALL YOUR FANS ALL THE TIME. I HONESTLY DO PREFER LETOYA'S ALBUM OVER THIS ONE."
1,I Should Have Known Looking at Her Hair.....,"that this album was gonna SUCK!!! AND IT DID! Glad I bought the bootleg and I can easily throw it out of the car. MESSAGE TO BEYONCE: We get the fact that you are with JayZ. Can you tell him that we are really waiting for him to retire for real tho. Dude is like 40 and you are 25? Guess you really are Dangerously in Love! You really are talented by yourself, and two others. Please boo, get back to singing real music....maybe your father could help out too...until then, the bootlegger will get my Beyonce dollars. Love you tho!"
1,Only one good song,"I absolutely loved Beyonce's debut album ""Dangerously In Love"" which had some great songs on it! In 2006 after a few years I anxiously waited for a comeback of miss Beyonce. I loved the then-new single ""Deja Vu"" featuring her now husband Jay-Z. That song aside, there are no good songs on this album besides the opening single ""Deja Vu."" Even ""Deja Vu"" sounds like a revamped version of her earlier hit ""Crazt In Love."" This album is just plain unoriginal. I like Beyonce and have been a fan of hers since the 90's but this is NOT my favorite album of her. I am hoping if she releases another album it will be much better. Sorry but I only give this one star."
1,Where's the melody,"Beautiful girl, lovely voice and all we get is this disc which is 90 percent of screaming scat / rapping or whatever this is.I tried to find hooks - songs like Deja Vu and Ring The Alram are basically the same phrase / beat over and over and over and over and zzzzzzzz....What's happened to finely crafted songs? I don't understand how lots of tough yelling and screaming (albeit somewhat melodically) counts as good music. One is fine but 8 tracks of it? Tiresome, uninteresting."
1,The real Beyoncé lost in the HYPE,"Okay Beyoncé, I admire your motivation and drive but to think you are serving the latino audience is absurd. Think about it... The writing is on the wall... GREED..... A talented singers but shame, shame I know Shakira inspires you but there is only one SHAKIRA that is able to crossover and succeed. Take a break and find yourself and your craft because you are lost...Where is Beyoncé??.. Stick with the original release."
2,b-day,"man ol' man. i expected more from her dis album. she has a great voice but dem beats she b singin on b wack as hell? only song i really like on this cd is ""kitty Kat""."
3,Have to be honest,I have to tell the truth. The only reason why i bought the CD because it was only 8 dollars at walmart and i know i am not the only one. If she made more than twenty songs for this album and she put on here her best ones than she must not have done that much work. One song that i do love on the album is the very last bonus song. She sings her heart out on that one. It sounds like an old whitney Houston ballad. Other than that the only songs i care for is ring the alarm and deja vu (which like a previous reviewer says it is a bootleg crazy in Love) if you can still find it for 8 dollars at Walmart i suggest you go get it if you a beyonce fan.
2,Disappointing,"I thought I would love this CD like I loved her 1st one... but alas, I don't. Its already OUT of playing rotation in my CD changer. There are a couple decent songs, but most of them are ""skipable"" unfortunately. I'm a big Beyonce fan but this CD didn't make the cut for me."
2,Dissapointed!!!,"I just knew that this album was gonna be as good as her first one, but I was totally proven wrong. Out of 10 songs, I liked 3. This album seemed rushed and it was just disappointing to think that she would put something out like this...."
2,A Bad 'B'Day' Party,"Bearable as one/fourth-cum-one/third Destiny's Child, where her sexual persona was in contrast to her love-of-Jesus, she has since morphed into public nuisance numero uno. Back and blander than ever, ironically, considering her histrionic vocal melisma. For all her unrestrained singing, and disregard, if you can, the visual swindle of everyone from Shakira to Mimi herself and-not-to-mention two puny cameos from b'friend Jay-Z, Beyonce struggles to sustain a cohesive course amongst the producers de trop, relying on their skill [or lack thereof] while forgoing all sense of her usual gift of melody. Not a `Crazy In Love' in the whole darned bunch. Though `Irreplaceable' comes close. My grade: C+"
3,Crossing Over,"I am not really a Beyonce fan, but I try to give everyone a fair shake. I listened to the cd twice and discussed it with strangers and I am not sure, but Beyonce must be doing her crossover thing on this one. Not sure that I like it, but not sure that I totally dislike it either. I am not into Pop music, but if I were I would love this cd. Where is Kelly Rowland?"
2,A Big Step Down from Dangerously In Love!!,I was excited about Deja Vu so I bought the CD that song and maybe one other song was the only ones I liked. The CD did not have enough songs and it was a pretty boring CD for me.
3,"Not her best, but not her worst either.","I have to admit, I was kind of disappointed in this album but that is my personal opinion. The production is SICK! (good), and her voice was on point, but I wasn't feeling the majority of the songs on her album. The album was also too short. Who wants to pay 12-14 dollars for 10 songs? Point blank, listen to the ENTIRE album, even if it's snippets before you purchase it. It's not typical Beyonce, I'm guessing this was ""Sasha's"" album. If you're looking for something new and different from Beyonce, then this is the album that you should purchase.---Pryncez"
4,My Post,"Big Beyonce' fan! Loved the cd and wish i knew that all these great songs were on here, would've bought it sooner!"
3,Okay :(,"This album is cool. After listening to it a couple of times it grew on me.I like Kitty Kat, Gettin' Bodied of course De Ja Vu. That's about it. I still love Beyonce though and can't wait for new projects!!"
2,SARAH IS THE DIVINE ONE AND REALLY THATS IT,"As much as I love Ms Reeves Sarah is just a cut above all of them, so anyone trying to attempt the songs the way sassy did them is gonna fall way way way short, especially on the first track. Sarah's final album was to my mind just fantastic the emotion that was evoked was exceptional and by far above anything else that I have listened to and let me tell you with a mega jazz vocal collection im talking from listening to the music, So just leave it there as far as Im concerned your version of obsession just goes nowhere. SOrry Ms Reeves but this album just does not cut it for me. Sarah is simple THE QUEEN........."
5,Flak Jacket in a Wal-Mart Parking Lot,What more do you need to know? The Onion takes us into their land of comedy that unfortunately is all too real.
1,Maximum Overdrive,"Leonard Maltin has it right, Maximum Overdrive is stupid and boring, at least. But I would go further, it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Teenagers may enjoy it though!"
3,I love Stephen King-- But the movie does not do his work any justice.,"Its almost always better to read the book than to watch a movie especially when it is something written by the master of horror, Stephen King.This movie is not one of the best representations of Stephen's writing, but it is still good to watch.3 stars."
4,Cheesy but entertaining,"Okay the concept is a little bit out there, but I loved this movie. It's cheesy, and the acting is stiff, but the silly story makes up for it. The special effects are decent for an 80's flick. You may have to suspend belief a bit to enjoy this but it's a definate saturday night and bored out of your mind movie."
2,I can't believe this is Stephen King!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I cant believe Stephen King could make such a piece of junk. The movie started out pretty good which is why it got 2 stars, but plummeted from thier. Instead of continuing the idea of Steamrolers crushing people and lawnmowers chasing people,they make it into attack of the killer Mack truck. It is also kind of funny that the shop owner has an RPG and m16's convieniently sitting in the back of his shop. I do not recomend this movie to anyone who doesnt want to waste two hours of thier day."
4,MAXIMUM OVERKILL!,"I had to see this film to the point where I had it memorized before I got bored with it. To anyone who critisizes it, don't think too much about it. Yes, there's gaps in logic, (like how there just happens to be a weapons collection conviently stowed away in the basement of the truckstop,) yes, the charecters could have been fleshed out more, but it's still a hell of a ride just for the humor, the action, and the violence. And the music. If you can't stand AC/DC, maybe you shouldn't bother, but otherwise check it out. I felt that the soundtrack really contributed to the adrenilen-pumping excitment. Stephen King in a cameo..., the bridge pile-up during the opening credits, and more. One complaint I have is Yearaldy Smith's charecter, who rivals Olive Oil for weakest female charecter ever created. She does nothing but scream and complain the whole time. If you don't mind this, however, then this is definetly worth seeing."
3,it's silly horror,"I remembered this movie way differently when I used to watch it back when it came out, then I got it and it seemed more silly now that I'm older lol. But I guess it's cuz I know trucks don't come to life."
3,"Agree or Disagree, It Is A Much-Needed Discussion","I don't agree with everything the author states in this book; however, Anonymous' opinions come from years of working in counterterroism for the CIA so we should take some time and really listen, really discuss what he has to say. Terrorism is by far the greatest threat to our nation, to the world, in the 21st century. More discourse, even from those who have a differing opinion, is needed. Having ears for only one side's opinions and theories will only put our nation in greater danger. So disagree if you like, but pick up this book and truly read it. You'll have a better understanding of terrorism for having done so."
4,Imperial Hubris,"Seems to be a well-researched and accurate account of why the Unites States is so despised among the Muslims of the world, and how we got there through the policies and actions of the Bush administrations in recent years, and the mistakes of years prior to that. Scary!"
2,"At best, fodder for critics of the establishment.","For all of it's clout, I frankly did not find this book very interesting or very convincing. Rather, it sounded like the author had a bone to pick with his former employers. Scheuer sounds more disenchanted than inspired, and I don't really find his arguments convincing."
4,Just What I Needed,I took it out of the box and it was up in running in less than 10 mins. Most of that time was spent waiting for it to index my music files. I did NOT follow the recommended guidelines of placing the various items far enough away from other devices (wireless router is next to the tranmitter) and it still works flawlessly.I am using it to stream music to a reciever in my basement that runs my outdoor speakers. I can sit on the deck and choose my music with the remote. Now if only Logitech made something that would bring me a drink!I noticed it uses a lot of memory so you may want to upgrade a bit. I am running a P4 3.0GHz with 2GB of RAM and it holds up well.
5,Logitech Wireless DJ Music System,"This unit was exceptionally easy to setup right out of the box. I have not had the problem with music dropouts except on rare occasions. Bear in mind, the mp3 format does not showcase the ""sonic realism"" of the original format (ie. ""wav"" files). All in all, I am very pleased with this unit and would buy it again and would recommend it."
5,Great product and highly recommended,I have used this now for sometime and cannot speak highly enough about it. I use it to connect to my PC and the big thing I like is the remote shows all your songs and you can scroll through them on-screen. Hence I really never need to go to my PC and can play any song or playlist from literally any room in the house.
1,Dont buy it,"I followed all the instructions carefully. It seemed to work fine for about two minutes and then the music started stuttering. My computer and the receiver are only about 30 feet apart. When I went on Logitech's own forum I found out that the company doesn't even support the thing anymore. According to one person the problem has to do with the receiver overheating and he was putting the thing next to a glass of cold water to get it to work. I followed the recommendations in the manual to improve the sound to no avail. It is too bad, because the remote control is quite slick. I sent mine back."
3,A different end,"Reading this book is like walking in circle around an undefined center. Each chapter is like a sudden pull toward this center looking through the eyes of each character telling the story in first person. In a chapter named after him, the author himself pops in to explain how he ended up writing this book. Finally, the 'creature' at the center of the 'circle' tells you how the overall story of looking for a perfect host makes sense (obviously, in its dedicated chapter). The genesis of the story is certainly original, however the supposed existence of such a creature is not as much."
4,"A dated, but engaging veiw of the shark","Although Cousteaus arn't marine biologists, the book does a fine job of describing their adventures underwater with sharks. Some of the stories depict courageous acts and an enthusiasm for underwater adventure that make the book engaging. There has been better and more scientific studies more recently on sharks of course, but this book is worth having in you library if you are interested in the subject. The illustrations by Jean-charles Roux are excellent. The photographs are good. This book is also certainly a history too: a history of the popularization of our excursion into the underwater world by the Custeaus. Not a five star because it is dated, but five star in most other respects.If you were to collect the whole collection I would think it would be quite a good set at that."
4,Military Review,"I got this light in Iraq and then brought it along for a second tour as well, it held up great. The lower power light on this gives you good battery life, however even on the highest setting this doesn't really compare to the pelican lights we were issued. I'd use this as a backup to my pelican/surefire or just to have on base as a ""garrison"" flashlight. Hope this helps."
4,Great light-expensive batteries.,"Really, this is a great light, entirely different from old flashlights in the way quartz movement watches were different from jeweled movement watches. The choice of two different types of light (LEDs for close-up work, Xenon for distance) makes this is a much better tool. Also, both types drain the batteries far less than the old, traditional incandescents did.The build is very good and the weight is just right. The major drawback here is the relatively pricey batteries. Not only do the cost a fair amount but they are somewhat hard to find.Nonetheless, this is a flashlight definitely worth having."
4,A lot of fun....,"I just finished watching the show from the 80's. I've always considered myself a big ZZ Top fan. As I recall, I saw them back in the 70's at the Tarrant County Convention Center in Ft. Worth and then again in Austin at the First Annual Rompin' Stompin' Barn Dance and Bar-B-Que (I forget what year that was). I saw them again in the late 90's in St. Louis. I just don't recall ever seeing Billy Gibbons this hopped up on so much 'natural' energy! :-D I wish I had seen them more back then!Edit: I just wanted to add, that in my opinion, their studio work is much better than this live stuff for the great sound nuances of the guitar riffs, but this is still a heck of an entertaining DVD."
3,"5 stars for 1980 disk, 2 stars for 2008 disk","here's my opinion...5 stars for the 1980 disk of the concert in Germany. Excellent sound quality and great live performance.2 stars for the 2008 disk, almost entirely of a concert in France which is annoying for the commentary excerpts and annoying in that the tracks really aren't that great. the Greatest Hits dvd of their hit music videos is better than this.$25.00 for one good dvd is up to you to decide if the price of one dvd is worth it. for the 1980 concert, maybe."
2,Not what I expected,"The band plays all the favorites but the sound and video quality isn't that good. I'm picky, so that is why I gave it 2 stars."
2,Lose that ridiculous dealership frame!,"Maybe the simplest, least expensive touch to add a finished look to your vehicle. If you prefer subtle, you'll be pleased.UPDATE 7/12 - I came back for a few more of these and found the price has increased 5x. Hard to be so enthused about these at $5-- Rating dropped."
3,just what I expected,Just wanted a little something for the license plate on our RV. Make it look much nicer than just the plate itself.
1,Don't Bother,"This book was soooo unrealistic. The only thing I enjoyed about it was ""Lizzie"" and Janet Catchpole"". The story seemed to focus more on Ben and not enough on Frankie. The chapters of Ben's dreams were terrible. The only reason I finished the book was to see the outcome of Frankie. I was so disappointed that there was not much said about Frankie or Lizzie in the end."
2,Hope its better than Daniels' DVD....,"Lets face it, TNA may be growing popular, and more people may be ordering Lockdown rather than WM22 [Ha Ha, I think not!!!!] but TNA does HORRIBLE DVD releases. Daniels' DVD did not do him justice, and Raven's DVD wasn't that good at all, poor choice of matches and they weren't even that good...Buy Bloodsport: ECW's Most Violent Matches instead of this. They are more brutal and much more exciting. Much more matches to see and World Wrestling Entertainment does a great job of putting on an actually good DVD release...So go on and order Lockdown folks, enjoy seeing a fake champ defend against the Goldberg of TNA and watch the ring collapse after Samoa Joe falls for the first time... Let other people see REAL wrestling and watch Bret Hart and Eddie Guerreroe inducted into the Hall of FameBy the way, if it's not WWE, It's not WRESTLING!!!!!"
5,"Awesome addition to your ""extreme"" DVD collection","Having already bought all the WWE made ECW DVDS, The Hardcore Homecoming boxset and TNA Hardcore Justice 2010 I was looking for something new to add to my ""extreme"" collection. TNA Best of the Bloodiest fit the bill perfectly. Almost every match features an ECW original and shows that TNA knows how to book a Hardcore match better than the current owners of the ECW name."
3,Something's Got to Give,"I enjoy seeing this film, but I don't know how it ends. It is an unfinished video as far as I know. I think it is sad that the movie is not complete because it is very funny to watch."
3,Can't open pen to replace cartridge. Please help.,"I would very much appreciate information on how to open this pen to replace the cartridge. It feels like twisting the middle section of the pen (to open and close the tip) beyond the where it naturally stops when the pen is open in order to unscrew it , will break it. Please advise."
5,Entre las matemáticas y la gestión empresarial,"De una manera muy agradable, los autores nos ofrecen un gran paquete de conocimientos matemáticos aplicables a los negocios. Con ejemplos claros y un diseño que facilita su lectura, este libro es una verdadera joya para quien desee ampliar el uso de herramientas matemáticas en la gestión empresarial. Desde toma de decisiones hasta PERT/CPM."
2,THE GAME'S AFOOT,"A 1982 tv movie has resurfaced, showing us that yes, Tom Hanks was a very young man when he was making his first movies and tv series. Sadly enough, this movie is dull and pretty uninvolving. It tells the story of four college students who play a game called Mazes and Monsters, which ultimately results in Hanks' losing his focus on what is and isn't real. There's no real suspense and the dialogue just panders along without any real crucial meat to it. Hanks shows a spark of what was to come, but even he can't rescue this one. Add a young Wendy Crewson (SANTA CLAUSE MOVIES, THE JOANNE KILBOURNE MYSTERIES), Chris Makepeace (MY BODYGUARD) and cames from some well known supporting players: Vera Miles, Anne Francis, Lloyd Bochner, Murray Hamilton, Peter Donat, Louise Sorel and Susan Strasberg, and you have a competent cast in a sorely developed storyline. Author Rona Jaffe's book may have been interesting, but this movie sure isn't."
4,Great book,"The book Scorpions by Walter Dean Meyers is a tremendous book that made me wonder about life in gangs. Jamal Hicks a character with a lot of life and attitude is trying to get his gang bound brother out of prision. As he goes along his journey of trying to find money for the appeal it makes the reader very excited,worried, and scared. Although the story is short and more to be desired, the characters are full of life and energy. I think that you should go out and read the book Scorpions because it is truly one of the greatest books I've ever read. I gave it four and half out of 5 stars."
5,"Scorpions a book review by Brittany, Nancy, Yaxayra","""The Scorpions don't have no fake guns,"" Jamal said.""You ain't no Scorpion""""I'm the leader of the Scorpions.""In the suspenceful book Scorpions by Walter Dean Myers, a young boy is presured into becoming the leader of a very violent gang after his brother Randy got arrested.After Jamal agrees to be the leader, he gets into several fights with a boy from his school and a couple of the members of the gang. Jamal's life is soon threatend when some of the gang members decide they don't want Jamal to run the gang.Walter Dean Myers explains what is happenning by using sensory images, vivid descriptions, and diolect. We would recomend this book to people 10 and up. Walter Dean Myers did a great job painting a picture in our heads,we could really see wats going on."
4,Gang-Related Novel,"I recommend this book. You read about the bad sides of gangs. If you like things about gangs, read this book. It's about this kid's struggle in a low-income neighborhood. In Jamal's house there's hardly any food. "" That chicken from Sunday and some potatoes."" That's to show that their mom isn't making a lot of money. Jamal's brother Randy wants Jamal to be the leader of the Scorpions. ""Take over the Scorpions."" Jamal is going to make a bad decision. I liked the book. I thought it was okay. I dislike reading, but it's something I'd read it again."
5,Andre's Review,ilike this book because it is about gangs n fighting.so when u see what happens 2 them and how they end up in jail and doing drugs and bad in school i think people should read it because it will show them what can happen too them if they dont do good in school.
4,Scorpions,"This was a very good book. This book deals with things that happen in real life, that's what makes it so good. It takes place in New York and is about a boy named Jamal. He is asked to lead his brother's gang because his brother is in jail. Jamal is not sure if he wants to lead his brothers gang. One of the reasons he is afraid is the fact that no one will listen to him because he is younger. The gang sells drugs on the streets. Jamal will do anything in his power to get his brother out of jail. But should Jamal sell drugs and go the easy way to get the money for his brothers appeal? Or does he do it the hard way and work for it? What will Jamal do? What decisions will he have to face down the road? Read the book and find out like I did."
2,VERY DEPRESSING,"If you are looking for a ""feel good"" book then this is NOT the book for you. I found it to be extremely depressing. Perhaps the most depressing thing is that so many have praised it for being so realistic and true to life. I hate to think that a life full of gangs, drugs, and violence is ""realism"" for so many young people. I would definitely not recommend this book for very young readers."
4,Is an exciting up to date book.,"The book Scorpions is an exciting book that deals with things that happen in real life. I like this book because it is an interesting book. It deals with gangs, school, and things that happen everywhere around the world. The main character is Jamal. Jamal is a twelve-year-old boy who is asked to take over the gang that his brother led, before he went to jail. Jamal is not sure about becoming the leader because he is only twelve. He also is not fond of being the leader because there are kids who are much older than he is so he fears that they would not listen to him. I like this book because there is never a time in the book that makes you want to put it down and stop reading. It also is like a mystery book. It is like a mystery book because when Jamal was a given a gun the author didn't say what happens to him with the gun. But the author does make you want to read more to find out what happens to Jamal and the gun. Overall this book is a good book."
4,The Scorpions,"Jamal is a twelve-year old boy that lives in a bad part of a city. He has an older brother who is in jail, a younger sister and his mother. There is a nearby gang named Scorpions. His brother was the leader until he was sent to jail. Jamal is now supposed to take over the Scorpions. Jamal has a hard time handling the gang. He does find a way to control it but some gang members do not want to listen to him. I really enjoyed this book. I think it had many interesting parts, and it would be a good book for young adults. This book somewhat compares to the Outsiders by S.E. Hinton, I think both books were great and I would definitely read them again."
4,Scorpions,"Scorpions Tim Roat Per. 3 4/30/01 My book is called the Scorpions, a book written by Walter Dean Meyers 1988. Its about a 13 year old boy named Jamal, who's older brother went to jail for murder. He was the leader of the gang called the scorpions. Since his older brother is locked up, his right hand man Mack is trying to get his little brother Jamal to run the gang. So he decides to do it so he can get the money to bail his brother out of jail. There is a lot of strong points in this book, such as, Jamal pulling a gun on one of his class mates in school, his brother gets stabbed while in jail, and one of Jamal's fellow gang members is trying to kill him. Personally I thought this was a really good book and I HATE to read. Everything is understandable, its not like other books where every other word you don't understand. So if your looking for a good easy book to read, I would suggest Scorpions."
3,Alright probally not one of the 50 best of 2005,These dudes are really strong rappers but the beats are pretty bad and boring. They got some bad beats with some bad quality in the volume.The Lyrics are nice and the guys who specialize in freestyling are good and they have nice Flows. This album will get a 3.5 out of 5 by me because of there borderline great lyrics but the structuring-beats-and replay are mere average at best. Next time they will hook up with some dope beats.Lyrics 8.5 Production 5 Replay 5 Entertainment 6.5
2,Some crucial points are no longer valid due to new regs.,"This would have been a very excellent book had publication been withheld until after the Taxpayers' Relief Act of 1998 had been signed into law. Mr. Bledsoe was aware there were going to be important changes and he provideded a form in the back of the book, that the reader can use to send for an update on the the new regulations. Unfortunately the turn arround time for the update is quite slow. As the book reads in its present form, some very important areas are no longer accurate and an unwary reader could be lured into making a mistake in choosing a Roth IRA."
1,Where was the editor when this book was published?,"Numerous grammatical errors, clumsy sentence structure and misused words detracted significantly from my enjoyment of this book. Maybe if the authors had bothered to look in a dictionary before using some of those words... The plot and characterization was OK, but nothing spectacular. The end result? Don't waste your time."
5,Simply Great Music!,I just love this concert footage. It answers all the questions that I had about the artists motivations after listening to and loving the studio album. I have a connection to racing and the tune Speedway At Nazareth is the best racing song I have ever heard. Mark Knopfler is superb and I wonder if John Prine wrote the song Angel From Montgomery about Emmylou Harris. Great stuff!
3,your opinion needed.,"Hello to all. I will try and explain this situation as brief as I can. If a person goes into surgery because of a cause that Is not known by hospital testing or by the surgeon, and the patient being asleep. During this surgery cancer or a tumor Is dicovered which Is malignant by Imediate testing. Who In this situation should be In charge of treatment type, the Doctor or the patient.The patient Is unaware of the discovery of cancer during surgery, should not the patient be told of their condition or should the surgeon procede to remove the tumor that was found. I guess this comes down to a persons right to make their own choices In the way to treat their own body. I thank you very much for your time and wish you a very good day, Saki."
2,Too sweet,"I had hoped this book would be a resource for Life Celebration Services, but the poems are over the top, syrup-y sweet. Not much of a resource for my use."
2,Nothing New,"If you know nothing about diet and exercise, this book may enlighten you some. But if you know anything at all, this is monotonous. There appears to be some good recipes, but I haven't tried any yet. All it says is eat well, exercise, and make time for yourself - don't need 130 plus pages for that."
4,I Love This Book,"I happened across this book in a second-hand store not knowing what to expect. After trying several of the recipes I am hooked. They are very simple, inexpensive, and tasty! There are also ideas on how to deal with particular ailments and the recipes are grouped accordingly."
5,Excellent Flashlight,"This an excellent flashlight. It is perfectly sized and balanced for most applications, particularly if you've become accustomed to a 3, 4 or 5 D-cell light as I have. And after you get used to the bright white light produced by the 6 LEDs, the supposedly higher lumen rating of the xenon bulb pales by comparison. Granted, batteries are not included, but this is a minor issue. Get a package of Duracells or, better yet NIMH batteries and you're all set. You'll have no regrets."
4,Serves a niche very well,"Let's admit it: not everyone is ready for HDTV yet. We thought we were, but after dragging home a 34"" widescreen HD set and running analog cable through it, we were disappointed with the picture. All we wanted was a good set to replace an LCD front projector that was too clunky and noisy to watch DVDs and LDs on anymore. This set gets used 99% of the time as an everyday beater and in the few days since we exchanged the HD set, it does very well -- not as many PIP or POP options as the one we took back, but good enough for someone who'd never had it before. The V-compression 16:9 mode is very effective for DVDs and provides an excellent picture with a 480i DVD player. Haven't watched a laser disc yet, but should be better that the lousy job of upconverting that the HD set was trying to do. Beware -- better have a nice, strong TV stand to put it on. It's a heavy sucker!"
2,Cablebox too high for my room and harder to tune and picture unsharp,Listen I'm telling you that I don't recommend this TV because I have Cablevision and its hard to navigate through channels. I'm not really saying its unsharp but it is sharp (which I'm saying is that I like LCD Plasma HDTV better because it is the right sight for my eyes and I can't see without glasses). Even my Dad will say that this TV is garbage and he plans to get a new LCD Plasma HDTV. Sony knows better than this and it ain't stupid. This doesn't meet the standards as it should be. Period.
1,Lousy remaster,"Sound quality is poor, distant, lacking any stage or presence. Also dissapointed with the version of Poinciana, mostly guitar by soemone I never heard of, and was not mentioned in the liner notes. Overall, a miss sonically and in the packaging."
5,Nice combs,"I don't actually use these for fleas. My cats are indoor only so we rarely get fleas. I use the flea comb for my short haired kitty's dandruff. We're working on eliminating the dandruff entirely, but the comb works great for removing the flakes. The tips are rounded so I don't worry about damage to her skin and she seems to like the feel. I use the larger comb, the fine comb, on her as well just to brush. It also works excellently on the stomach and under-arms of my long-haired Maine Coon. Most combs aren't small enough to comb where his front legs meet his torso. He isn't prone to matting, but if he was to mat that would be the place.The combs are nice to hold, easy to grip, and the container is convenient.I have used the flea comb for fleas on my sister's cat. It worked well, combed out the little bloodsuckers and kept them trapped until I could brush them off into some soapy water. It's better than many flea combs I've used, and no worse than any other."
5,Great flick and score by John Barry!,"I remember seeing this film in the theatre in Hong Kong when it first came out back in 1976, I was only 10 and it was marvelous!!! Getting the record years later [which I still have] and just the other day the re-release of the soundtrack from Silver Age Classics. It's such a memorable score!I also just saw the new 2005 Peter Jackson's King Kong last night, the CGI was superb, I especially liked the t-rex bit... but I gotta say, with the dinasaur scene, it really isn't much compared to this 1976 classic. I loved this version from beginning to end. The music worked superbly!!! The whole package just works - for me!"
2,KING KONG,"I didn't really like this movie as much as the original. It lacked the charm of the original, but the story was okay. I liked how they updated everything. The expeditiion was to search for oil instead of a movie, and they used the twin towers instead of the Empire State Building. The best part was the sexy Jessica Lange, who looked really hot in that sacrifical outfit."
1,Good Luck Getting It,"This is a review of the DVD. While I like this version of the movie more than most, good luck actually getting it. I've ordered it twice, and both times they've sent me the Faye Wray version, even though the order clearly stated Jeff Bridges and all is in order. Amazon needs better fulfillment partners and quality control or they are going to go the same way as the Atari."
1,BURN THIS MOVIE!!,"Zero stars actually! I won't waste much effort and space on detailing all the reasons why this movie should be destroyed but I must say it is an INSULT to the original. When this movie came out I was a kid and I remember wanting to like it, even to the point of defending it. After several years I saw it again and had to admit what even as a kid I had known deep down inside; this is a truly awful film. Rick Baker's ape suit is pretty good given the technology of the day. Jessica Lange, Jeff Bridges and Charles Grodin are all fine actors but in each case this film is the stain on their resume. Many of the customer reviews here say ""don't listen to the critics."" Well, don't listen to those people! The critics in this case are right. There is good reason for any true lover of the original to revile this mess of a movie. I say burn it and let's pretend it never existed."
2,Dissapointing,"No doubt this movie appeared to the best till i watched the original 1933 classic.I cant believe how De laurantiis could dare to make a movie like this, killing the original concept.Even the size and structure of the ape is not proportinate.would have done much better.One logic question - If the 30 ft plus ape can climb the world trade center, how can a 30 ft fort prevent it to cross the wall?"
3,king kong,i never recieved this product still wating for this to come in .let me know whats going on please cant rate something when it was never recieved
3,"A Fun, Cute Classic!","I thought this movie was pretty good. Of course there wasn't anything cute about the monkey but the story itself was cute. You see how the ape kidnaps the lady and falls madly in love with her, smashing and killing anything and everything that gets in his way. Being that I was only 5 years old when the remake premiered at theatres, I didn't realize this version had come from an original until around '87 or 88', after watching the 1933 version on television one late Friday night."
1,...remake,It's rather amazing that Jessica Lange ever worked as anactress after starring in this turkey of an ape movie. They basicallyripped apart the story by just having Kong living alone on the island.Only one large fight with a giant snake and no dinosaurs in sight. ... Unbelievabe love story between Lange and Bridges (no chemistry there) and Kong climbing the World Trade Center lacked the excitement that the 1933 Kong's climb to the Empire State Building had. ... Watch the 1933 King Kong instead... END
5,Not many re-makes have turned out this good !,"A very good movie with some tongue-in-cheek humor. I have always enjoyed this movie, and would highly reccomend it to all."
1,Waste of time,"This movie is just a waste of time. I was hoping it'd be an updated version of the 1933 classic. Maybe tweak it or fine-tune some of the weak points. But instead they threw out all the stuff that made the original Kong so great (the tight plot, the cool special effects, the eerie music, the psychotic dinosaurs, and so on) and made it contemporary. The new plot is just weird, the music isn't that great, the special effects are worse than Godzilla, and there aren't any dinosaurs, save a paper-mache snake that shows up for maybe half a minute. Throwing in swears DOESN'T make the movie any more sophisticated! Ugh.And for the record, most of Kong's scenes WERE done by a rubber suit. The giant robot Kong was only used in a few scenes."
1,a movie at its worst,this is 1 of the worst movies ever made i urge u if u have taste dont buy this buy the 1933 origanal in videothis version is not only bad its insulting to any true kong fan and as a film stutent i can honestly say i could have made a better film the kong looks better in the original the acting is better the effects may not be as good in the 1933 version but the stop motion is amazing people still cant belive thats a puppetif you want fun exitment and drama watch the origanal if you want to waste a couple of hours of your life and your money watch this
3,A look at the not so distance future a tame mad max,"The idea was good the concept was better, but the film fails to deliver.There is no need for an R rating as you could fall asleep half way through.the weapons look what they are - plastic.The weapons don't sound as a gun should when fired, all together if you are bored and want to have a few beers and only watch a movie every five minutes, then this is the film for you.Start it half way and you won't miss anything."
4,impressive combo,It's impressive that there is a car radio that can combine both the cd and cassette players in a package small and feature laden enough to fit in the space of a single media player
5,Pyle PLCDCS90M,The product was great. I loved this product because it has a combination of everything. The sound was great and the system was not hard to learn.
5,Good Read.,"Being from the Baton Rouge area, I had to read this book. It told soooo much more than was on the local news and made you feel as if you were on the scene. The book came timely and in good condition."
5,A wonderful tool I use Every Day!,"This is a wonderful little toolbox full of great ideas of how to improve your life on a daily basis and begin to live a life that is happy, joyous and free.Highly recommend."
4,informative and critical,"I enjoyed this book. As a casual listener to Pink Floyd, I would like to know sometimes what they were trying to do (Which obviously means they weren't too successful). also, this book give the history of the songs ... the production details and goings on the band to put the songs into a historic perspective. I give it a thumbs up."
5,The best case for 30GB Zune,I researched multiple cases before going for this one. This is the best. The slots are positioned perfectly. You can use your Zune fully without having to take your Zune out of the case.
5,Good Product,"Good quality product. The only draw back, if there is one, is the cover over the center control is kinda thick and if your not carefull you'll push the wrong part. It's not a huge deal it's probably just my thick fingers."
2,"Nice looking, not very useful.","The case itself looks nice on the outside, but once you put your Zune in it and open it up, you'll regret ever buying it. The plastic screen protector is so foggy and smudged that you're lucky if you can see anything through it. If you leave your Zune in it, the stitching around the center control leaves smudges and indentations around it. Mine is also falling apart. Be smart, stick to the fabric cover that came with the Zune. Don't buy DLO products, they're expensive cheaply made products."
5,Ghostfreak Toy,I am very fond of this figure as I have been trying to find it for my son since he first saw Ben 10. That is why I bought 2 of him. One to open and one to keep sealed.
1,NOT what is pictured,"I ordered the cannister that was pictured as the 20"" retro kit with houseing. What I recevied was an adapter, ie. the middle of the dust collector that accepts the bottom bag and the top cannister. I have NOT received the cannister fileter. I'm trying to figure out if this is a two part shipment or if the catalog listing is just wrong. In either event, what I thought I was buying based on the picture and description is NOT what I received."
1,Broke After Little Use,"I purchased this unit to help understand soil PH on my property. I used it on four different dates over the course of two years. I keep it safe, in its original packaging, stored in my home office. It was never dropped or abused. I was always careful in handling it. I keep it clean and dry.On my last attempt to use it, it failed to record any PH reading other than 7.0. Later lab tests indicated that the soils were very acidic.From my experience, product reliability is not good."
2,This is not a book. It is a laminated card.,"This is a single page, plastic laminate card. It has small hand-colored pictures and limited notations on about 100, primarily intertidal or shallow water, species. Notations give size of the critter and where it might be found, in very small type."
5,Nice,"I like two modes of operations. It is very bright, excellent workmanship. It feels nice in a hand."
2,Here's another 2 big ones 4 Olympus.,"1. This is my second recorder from Olympus that I've experienced with half or no aural output to head/ear phones!2. no continuous playback function like on the wonderful Sony icd-sx25.I would give it one star, but it didn't blow up in my face or anything like that; but @ this rate it's obviously not a superstar-i product!Sincerely yours."
3,Worth the money but not outstanding.,"The transfer is fine on the DVD, but the lack of widescreen holds the movie back. Not bad but not outstanding."
2,Extreme Prejudice-DVD Edition,"One of my all time favorite Walter Hill movies gets botched on DVD. If ever a movie deserved to be in the widescreen format,this is it! The movie is cropped horribly! Also no 5.1 sound,only mediocre stereo. Artisan should do Hill fans a favor andre-release it in widescreen. Buyer beware!"
4,an exciting thriller,"I really enjoyed Donna Anders' thrillers, and was looking for another author who wrote suspenseful, scary books I could curl up on the couch with on a cold rainy evening. Most of the thrillers written from a female point of view seem to be thinly disguised romance novels and the heroines are helpless twits, but happily I have now discovered Wendy Corsi Staub. I have read several of her books and they are all good and scary, with female characters I can respect and relate to. ""Lullaby and Goodnight"" is about Peyton, a thirty-nine year old woman living in Manhattan, with a successful career but no relationship and a ticking biological clock. She decides to become artifically inseminated (she is not pregnant by a former lover, as an earlier reviewer wrote). She becomes friends with another single mother-to-be in a support group. When her new friend disappears, strange and frightening things start happening to Peyton. You will be kept on the edge of your seat up to the last page."
5,The Comprehensive Collection of Bennion's Essays,"Someone once said that the essay was *the* essential form of Mormon writing because it so nearly matched our tradition of testimony-bearing and Nephi's standard of ""glorying in plainness."" This book is the essential collection of Lowell Bennion's work, stretching from his earliest contributions to published church manuals to late in his life (though he managed to complete several small books in his old age after this was assembled.) Every page is a feast for those who would like to reconcile the best of LDS teachings with the best of the world's humane wisdom. Common sense was Bennion's guiding light, as he struggled to search out what the Holy Spirit made manifest in the turbulent world. This edition was published by Deseret Book (as were most of Bennion's earlier books.) It's a shame it's out of print. A new generation needs it very badly."
2,Better Books Out There,"Time would be better spent reading the Limits to Growth ed.2004 and/or Collapse by Jared Diamond.Very little original material exists in this book. It is mostly a regurgitation of basic theories mixed with a great deal of personal emotion and theory from the author. If you must, read the book for the basic messages, ignore the rest."
2,Buy a better quality step - you will be glad you did,"This stupid piece of junk keeps falling apart. Grant you, it is my boys making it fall apart and not the dogs, but it is really so poorly put together that I can't emphasize enough that a better step is the way to go. When my boys aren't destroying it, my puppy is tearing off the ""carpeting"" that is on each step.I have an all carpet, really solid staircase for the dogs in my bedroom. It is so much better, although heavier.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. It is overpriced and useless."
2,Great while it lasts,"I purchased this item specifically for its claims of long-lasting light off a single pair of D batteries. My most recent experience is that the advertised battery life of 80 hours for the 5 LED setting was reduced to about 5 hours in ~15 Deg F temperatures. I got the light for use in overnight trail running where I didn't want to have to carry spare batteries, and was nearly left out in the dark. I've heard other complaints about the 3-way switches giving out, so that may be what's wrong as well. I'm hoping to be able to return it.On the plus side, it does make a nice amount of light, although I don't really see any difference between the 10 LED's and 1 xenon bulb to be honest."
5,A fine presentation highly recommended for any collection catering to early learning professionals,"The second updated edition of PATHWAYS TO COMPETENCE: ENCOURAGING HEALTHY SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN YOUNG CHILDREN covers all social-emotional aspects of young kids and is a 'must' for early childhood professionals. From understanding what emotional milestone kids should reach at different age levels to updated exercises and activities to sharpen parenting skills, many major child-rearing theories converge on a fine presentation highly recommended for any collection catering to early learning professionals."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Photos indicate a large unit sturdily built like my 15yr old shredder. Not so, the parts do not fit together, the hopper is only 15 inches across and would hold only a small amount of leaves. The black hopper attachment is a flimsy piece of plastic, Guess where this was made! I am hoping to return mine. Customer service at Flowtron recommended using oil to get the upper and lower units in place! When that didn't work, they offered to send another top unit as there have been alignment problems."
5,great leaf shredder,I shred leaves to use throughout the year to add to the compost pile. It reduces the amount about 10-fold and decomposes much more quickly than whole leaves. I used a Flowtron for well over 5 yrs without a problem and did need to replace it this fall.
4,Works as expected,"I had a Leaf-Eater years ago but sold it when I didn't need it anymore. I was happy with the product back then and am happy with it now. I am careful to sort out obvious twigs as I load it, but some slip by with no problem. It does seem to only shred at one setting. I did not notice a change in particle size when I slid the lever. No problem since the size that it does shred is perfect for my garden mulch. I'm very happy with this product. We have 6 maple trees and a couple of oak trees in our yard, so this item is very needed."
2,probably great for leaves,"i bought this in hopes of shredding straw.... nope, it won't do it. guess i'll keep looking."
3,leaf mulcher review,"Semi-OK. Does not work well at all if leaves are even somewhat wet, in my opinion. Delivery etc. were fine"
5,Exactly as advertised,"I was recently asked to make tongue and groove flooring to match oak treads, risers, skirts, and cap on a stairway that I was building. The customer did not want comercially available flooring, and insisted on custom made flooring for 2 landings. After a short period of adjusting the router table, each board came out as close to perfect as I could hope for. A little sanding and perfection. All that I could ask for. As for shipping problems that others have encountered, mine arrived undamaged, but one of the pieces was loose inside the factory packaging."
5,Clever,Very delightful and charming movie that takes to the literal extreme what Woody Allen has been doing throughout his film-making career: investigating Woody Allen.
1,Struggling to be positive about this one,"I felt like I was watching an amateur production of a minor, and long-forgotten play. I couldn't quite make up my mind if the cast were just incompetent, or the script was letting them down very badly. Probably both. Some of Helen Hunt's lines fell so flat I cringed for her. The interaction between her and Woody was possibly the least convincing bit of acting I've seen in a long time. I'm amazed he dare release it.Worse, the plot is utterly peurile and full of holes you could drive a truck through. And it isn't funny, except for a couple of minor gags.It makes ""Small Time Crooks"" look like a masterpiece."
2,the movie cannot withstand the passage of time,"I want to clarify that I like Oscar Wilde's form of humor and cynicism.I have studied the Importance of Being Ernest when in High School and saw the movie during a class trip. I also saw the play at a later stage of life. Out of nostalgia, and for sentimental reasons, I bought the video when it became available. Well, it was a reality check for me. Granted that the Importance of Being Ernest was a farce, the lines still remained amusing and clever. However, the production was very stagey, the acting too pretentious for a movie, especially in the role of Gwendoline. The movie lacks the naturalism and spontaniety of a movie, and it lacks the dramatic effect, the immediacy and intimacy of a stage work. One can't help feeling that the movie creaks of old age!! So, Oscar Wilde fan, go see the play, go read the play, but avoid the movie, unless you want to relive your more innocent and impressionable youthful days."
1,Low quality,"Very low quality. BNC connector is OK, but both of the alligator clips are misaligned and don't want to close all of the way."
1,Dreadful film transfer,"MGM, the DVD distributor for The Four Feathers, should be ashamed of the shoddy treatment they have given to this magnificent film. Known for its rich early Technicolor photography, many shots in The Four Feathers are out of register and of inferior color quality. The print is also scratched and worn. The only money invested seems to be in the glossy new packaging, without a penny to the movie inside. If a film this great wasn't worthy of restoring you have to wonder what is. If this is your first time watching this wonderful film, stay away from this DVD; if you've seen and loved it before you'll shriek in horror."
2,Vampiric Erotica ?? NOT !,"I guess I should have read the reviews better. This book is not Erotic as I thought it should be. [...]. I did of course read every page. These stories are not the sexy, romantic, love you forever type. They are dark and depraved. I of course bought the next book and will update it when I get the stomach to read it. I am at least prepared for this type book."
2,"What I expected, except for customer service","I ordered 4 drip pans, received 1 in one shipment, 2 in another, still missing the 3rd. Their own paperwork validated this. Called customer service, they assured me they'd ship it immediately, still no shipment."
2,Motor does not last,"I purchased this to help mulch the large amount of pine needles I get in my yard each year. It did a great job mulching. And I loved using the pine needle mulch in my flower beds. It got used only 2-3 times in the summer, but for extended time periods (takes about a half day to clear up all the pine needles). I think I was pretty reasonable about not overloading, and pine needles are very light, but the motor burned out after only a year and half (after warranty had expired). That really is not a good return for what the product cost."
1,Garbage!,The motor died the 2nd time I used it. Buy a blower/mulcher or mower/mulcher instead. This is a complete waste of money!
1,Dangerous.,Jams easily. Clearing the jam could cost you a finger. Not an efficient piece of equipment.
4,Great Product,"Our area is heavily wooded with oaks and, therefore , produces lots of leaves. This is an efficient and clean way to get rid of them.The product is a little bulky to move around and the strings have to be changed often and that is awkward."
2,Shreds leafs only and not twigs,I purchased this before I knew what is really required for my lawn. I have a wooded lawn where I have plenty of leaves and twigs falling from Spring to Winter.This product uses replaceable plastic strings to shred the leaves and they are NOT effective when they hit a twig. The plastic strings just disintegrate and are gone within a few minutes if your pile has a couple of twigs.Now I am in the market for a shredder/mulcher which can handle twigs and leaves.
1,Don's Opinions,JUNK Just like the other one star reviews.The motor won't last more than one year.Buy a WORK WG430 It has a much better motor.
4,upgrade the strings right away,"One of my old llamas has a chewing problem, which requires I cut up his grass hay into short pieces. I have used the LE-900 leaf shredder regularly for this purpose for well over a year. In other words, it has seen a lot of use. The most frequent complaint I see in the reviews is the short string life. Just like a new car that comes with inexpensive OEM tires, this shredder comes with cheap strings. My suggestion is to put them aside from the beginning and buy a spool of premium string. I've been using Husqvarna Titanium .095 string, which lasts much longer and cuts faster too. My biggest complaint is with the hub that holds the strings. It's made of plastic and held on with a nylon nut. Both should be metal. These parts wear out too quickly. They haven't been replaced yet, but will soon need to be."
2,For a One Season Solution,"I bought this leaf shredder in 2003 Spring and used it for about 10 or 15 bags of leaves. It works pretty well, but is difficultto set up, the stand works loose with just a little use and has to be continually tightened. Parts are difficult to reorder.You have to send a check, the manufacturer does not accept anycredit cards so it sometimes takes 2 weeks to get trimmer line and parts that break. I have already had to replace the spool which holds the cutter line. I have not been able to find any dealer who carries the parts online."
4,Leaf Shredder - Revisited,"The Flowtron LE-900 is working great. It is almost a carbon copy of one from Sears that my wife and I wore out last year after several years of faithful service.The only difference I noted in the two was that I had to assemble the ""funnel"" on the LE-900.We hope this one gives the same long service as did the Sears version.ECR"
2,Light Use Only,"Pros:*Can go where the leaves are (ie, in a flower bed where you can mulch and spread right in place)*Makes a fine textured mulch which looks nice in beds and quickly decomposes in compost piles.BIG CON:*Not for a yard with lots of leaves (we have 12 large hardwoods and smaller trees like dogwoods, too). Though we mulch and bag most of the leaves on the grass with a bagger/mower, this unit did not last well even w/ just the leaves in the flower beds. It just stopped running, period.For lots of leaves, either get a heavy, large, and expensive unit, or just keep raking, mowing, bagging, and moving the leaves as you mulch them....and get good exercise, too!"
4,Better than mowing,"Although this product is a bit delicate, it does a job on leaves, shredding them down to a fine mulch. This ""weed-wacker"" in a drum reduced all the leaves in my compost pile to useable mulch for my beds this fall and I'll use it to reduce this year's leaves into more manageable particles for composting this year. Just put it over a garbage can and you can easily transport mulch to any part of your yard. It does put a lot into the air, so protect your eyes."
4,Makes a manly noise,"this is a great machine--instead of having dozens (if not hundreds) of bags of leaves to get rid of, i just have a little pile of leaf-bits in the back of my yard.The only problems are that in about 1.5 hours of use is that i have had to replace the cutting cords. Fortunately: (1) Flowtron sent about 2-dozen extra and (2) it takes less than a minute to replace them.Another issue is the pair of black plastic pieces that make the 'mouth'. i could never get them to seat properly in the red part of the machine and within an hour their clips broke apart that hold them together--thank goodness for duct tape.also, it doesn't like sticks, but i knew that from the promotional literature.all-in-all i like it because i don't have to bag leaves now!"
4,Works well,It works as advertised and reduces the amount of bags of leaves. It's dusty and a little noisy but that's standard for any mulcher. It won't handle sticks so you have to stop it periodically to remove a stick that gets in there but other than that I am happy with it.
5,Works for me,I have ~ 25 trees in my yard. I use a blower to pile leaves and then shred with this. Makes the job quick and easy. Sticks and limbs are put aside for campfires or trash bundles. The mulch is a 30:1 reduction. Very nice. The shredder stores well with the feeder side pointed down. If you have a lot of leaves this is a good solution.
5,Mulching is fun !,"My husband has been ""playing"" with this mulcher for days. It works great. He has mulched everything in the yard ! Great product."
1,Great Idea; Poor Execution,"Purchased the Leaf Mulcher in 2004. Having a small yard, I estimate I ran the machine a maximum of 25 hours. This past winter, it began making an awful racket and refused to run anymore. Upon examination, I found the motor shaft turns in a sleeve bearing. How CHEAP AND JUNKY!!!!!! The sleeve bearing nearest the spinner head had worn considerably, allowing such a wobble as to destroy the motor. I did like shredding the leaves, as they make good mulch for the garden. However, it was a real pain to use. Even the smallest oak twigs could break the line. The funnel never fit together very well. The stand was flimsy and the knobs would not stay tightened. With some improvements, such as high quality motor bearings and the ability to use larger cutting line,Flowtron would have a great product. Unfortunately, after years of people complaining, the company has not seen fit to engineer any improvements into the product."
4,Good buy for the price,"This is a quite satisfactory light duty shredder. It is not difficult to assemble. I gave it quite a workout, and stalled it a few times, but on the whole it worked quite well on a lot of leaves, mostly maple and oak, and the occasional twig. I recommend using the heaviest allowable string. Because it must be connected to an electrical source, the leaves must be brought to it, something of a problem on a large place such as we have."
4,Flowtron Leaf Shredder,"This product worked better tnan I had anticipated in reducing dry leaves to managable mulch.The only problem that I encountered was with the circuit breaker on the unit tripping when I fed the hopper too fast and continuously. This problem was resolved by slowing down the feeding process, making sure all leaves were mulched before more were added."
2,Patient Teaching Made Incredibly Easy! (Made Incredibly Easy) by Springhouse [Paperback],"Information is very childlike in nature and very superfical. The book is used and apparently was purchased in a liquidation sale with a ""Sold As Is"" price sticker of 1.89. That would have been a good price -- not the one I have paid. The book does not meet my needs for patient teaching in Home Health at all."
5,"Great Service, Great Product",Although it has been a while since I made this purchase I do remember that I was well pleased with the prompt delivery and the excellent condition of the DVD upon its arrival.
2,Not so good,"The audio on this DVD was interrupted. It got better as the movie progressed but as so much of the movie is conversation, it definately hurt the viewing pleasure."
5,Great blade,"This is the best rip blade for 4/4 or less stock I have ever used. Though not as fast as the LM72, it isn't supposed to be, and it is much faster and more efficient than using a combo blade. The edges never need a run through the joiner--in fact, I like the edge better. Quiet and smooth. I will change to it for just a single rip. I do, however, like the red one better."
2,Power to the people short version.,"This album is Power to the people repackaged without the new studio tracks and without the solo's, leaving the live tracks. It's the short version released in 2006.Your better of getting the full real Power to the people album.I still gave it 2 stars because it's Poison."
5,"Hey, audiophile with fine ears, listen¡¡","I'm always finding great recordings to make perform my speakers BW Nautilus and all my fine equipment. In addition I don't want just a high resolution sound: I want also a good singer, good ballads, etc.Ok, this one of the best recordings I ever heard. It's a real example of SACD multi-ch. All sounds are in the right place.Don't forget my advise: try this one."
5,he Grapes of Wrath,"What a Great movie, one of the best. Authentic to the core! I was brought up knowing all about the depression and the okies. My parents as well as grandparents, aunts, uncles, to name a few. All came from Oklahoma to California during the depression. They lived this movie, in every sense of the word. My Mama loved watching this, even though she cried throughout it. The okies were tough, strong and proud folks. As Jane Darwell so aptly put it "" were the people and the people keepa agoin"" A true American classic!"
2,"Skip The Movie, Read The Book","Steinbeck's novel is a must read for anyone interested in American history, especially that of the 20th Century. The book is well crafted with fully developed characters and a strong story line. The movie skips important developmental information, assumes unreasonable knowledge on behalf of the viewer, and distorts the story line. If you have read the book you will be very disappointed in the movie. If you have not read the book you will be confused by leaps in logic throughout the movie."
1,Disgrace to Steinbeck,"John Steinbecks book is the most beautiful book ever written and this movie is an abomination. It is completly different from the book and if someone really wants to know the story, READ THE BOOK!!!!!!"
3,scary movie 0,"reading too much material on our economic future I see this as a deja vu for surviving this decade, deep sympathies evoked only when one can relate and I can only see this migrant path of seeking food and discrimination that perhaps this depression only ekes a sliver of what is to come... a testament to fortitude and just a dance could set minds flowing with abundance I doubt this will be the case in the near term, we will prolly look back and see how wonderful their lives were... no one had credit cards and hence significantly less debt, the assistance programs were more abundant and the global debt was negligible vs today, so hold on to ur tophats lads... wonder what Steinbeck would write today?"
2,Grapes review,I didn't think the story followed the book very well. It concentrated on Tom and Ma Joad and most of the othercharacters were either not well acted or nearly non-existent. The preacher acted as though he was mentallydeficient. I much prefer the play and the book!
3,A pretty good trip,A trippy psychedelic go-go dancing murder movie. The dialogue scenes were pretty fun to watch - wish there were more of them.One drawback was the frequency and length of the topless go-go dancing scenes. At least 4 of them seemed to last 5-10 minutes.I actually liked the theme song (it was constantly played). The color and video looked very high quality.
4,Love him or hate him,"You either love Richard Laymon or hate him. There is no in between. He has such a unique style and story telling ability. He is one of a kind. I have read many of his books and he never disappoints. Creepy, haunting, erotic, suspenseful once you start a Laymon book you can't put it down. Even though this book is over 500 pages it like all of his books are a very fast read."
2,None,completely over hyped. went for the shock factor only. just another man torturing women. something I would expect from jack ketchum.
1,Lame Laymon strikes again!,"This is my 3rd, and LAST, attempt to punish myself into trying to read a Richard Laymon (yawn) 'story'. His VERY JUVENILE perception of women and their various body parts makes me worry he is really, truly a sex starved little boy in a mans body. My LORD- what adult thinks the way he does ? Sure, women can be sexy and hot, but he always, in EVERY book I've stumbled through of his, writes as if he is a horny little 14 year old who has NO idea of how women really think or react. I can hardly believe he was married! Or that Dean Koontz was a best friend of his....but dont waste your money on his writing, the story lines on the back always are catching (duh- someone ELSE writes that!) and you will find yourself thinking,,hmm, maybe this sounds like a unique story! But his writing is childish and never, ever do the characters use common sense. Its very disturbing to me that he developed a following of readers! What must they be like, truly, deep inside???"
1,Wish I could give it 0 stars...,"This was an absolutely dreadful novel. It should have been rejected by the publishers. The characters are completely inconsistent; their motivations for their behavior are non-existent. It's as though Ms. Bradford started writing, had no earthly idea where the story was going, and just randomly pulled plot elements out of a hat. Why in the WORLD did she decide to turn Stevie's father-in-law into a rapist? What purpose did that serve in the story? And what about Gideon's ""stalker"" ex-girlfriend? What was THAT all about? I kept thinking she would be the one to hurt Chloe, but instead we get the deranged ex-husband of a minor character in the book, whom we never knew had an ex-husband in the first place. And that Nigel...who is he--Jekyll and Hyde? I could go on and on and on...Don't even think of bothering to read this book unless you just want an example of what NOT to do if you're considering writing a novel yourself."
5,The Power Of Romance,Barbara Taylor Bradford's fans will love this story about precious jewels and precious relationships!
1,Very Unimaginative--Time Waster,I was very disappointed with this book. The characters were not very well developed and I felt that the author spent more time describing the character's opulent surroundings rather than put any thought into the plot or the characters' personalities. I kept thinking it would get better but it didn't.
4,A NICE BOOK FROM A VERY PROLIFIC AUTHOR,"For lovers of romantic books, this is a very nice piece. Barbara Taylor Bradford is not a perfect author. But then nobody's perfect, so why would I want perfection from her? But let's go back to the subject: this book is about lost, hate, vingeance, and obviously, love and how we learn from these feelings.The plot itself is not very cool. Barbara has a way of telling the story that sometimes make the reader wonder why he/she is still reading the book. But what's worth with her is exactly this: the up and downs of the book and the good sensation you get after reading her books.Personally, I found this to be one of her best books. After reading it, you don't regret and, to the credit of Barbara - and to her cash also - you want to read another. Then you become a frequent reader of hers without realize it. Isn't that wonderful? :)Marco Aurelio - contact: deankoontzfan@hotmail.com"
2,Very slow and hard to get into,This was the first Barbara Taylor Bradford book I have read and I was very disappointed.
1,"COMING FROM BRADFORD, PURE DRIVVLE","Woman of Substance was one of the classic novels of our time. On a par with Gone With the Wind.Power of a Woman, in my opinion, was only published because Bradford had previously written a great classic novel. ""Power"" is dialog burdened with no character development and details to fill the pages to earn the advance i.e., the clean apron to be murdered in. Since Woman of Substance I have looked forward to a Bradford book, but this was not in keeping ith the quality of her previous work."
3,Just an Ordinary Book,"This book is just like any other survival story you see out there. There is always a guy who crashes on an island, finds a friend, and then somehow gets off the island. For it to be a good book, it has to have some type of twist to it."
1,Does not run!!!,It has never run. The motor just humms.I could have spent much less money but thought I was buying a superior item. My mistake!!!
5,Best product out there!,Before I got this product my suits were being destroyed by chlorine within a month. I swim 4-6 times a week and my suits last about 3 mths. now since I've been using this product.
3,Fun and cute but not durable,"My eighteen month old loves this placemat. It's cute and fun. But the color is already chipping off even though I haven't used anything more abrasive than a dish rag and liquid dish soap to clean it, and it scratches easily from her utensils. Also, it would be nicer if there were something on the back to keep it from sliding around so easily."
1,CANNOT PLAY MINE,I ORDERED THIS DVD AND CANNOT PLAY IT IN THE USA. COMPLETELY WORTHLESS TO ME DUE TO REGIONAL CODING. ZERO STARS.
1,Replacement Part Found,"I too have had a bad experience with this blender. The blade stuck just as it has for everyone else. However, it seems that Westinghouse must have bought Letrix or something because they have this same blender. You can order the replacement part through Westinghouse or Salton who is their parent co. Just ask for the blade assembly replacement for the Intelliblend W2000. It cost me $5.30 and at least I don't have to buy a new blender at the moment. This review is mainly for those of us unfortunate enough to have already purchased this blender. To anyone looking to buy it, DON'T."
2,lectrix is a terrible company,my blender lasted about a year before the teeth on the bottom of the blender broke. i've been trying to get a replacement for over 6 months now with no response from the company. the piece must cost less than $1. i told them i'd pay $10 and i still don't get a response. i bought a new blender to replace it.
4,Decent book for Western audiences,"This book brings awareness for some that there has been a shift in intercultural ministry that has been happening (and is continuing to happen) globally. As other reviewers have noted, this book is accessible and carries an appropriate excitement in describing what God is doing on a global scale. Escobar provides an introductory glimpse at the biblical basis for missions and practical implications.Having been published in 2003, some of the information is starting to show its age. I hope there will be a revision in light of the sixth Lausanne Conference that happened last year in 2011, reflecting more current global missions."
4,/,"Escobar's book gives views which allows for being aware of what people think, believe and understand."
1,very disappointed,"I tried loading the games 5 disks, one to four went ok...then 5 wouldn't load....so I sent back....now I can't get the first 4 disk stuff off my computer......I don't know if this was just a quirk or the usual experience.....poor quality control"
5,My favorite game of all time,"This game has everything--great humor and dialogue, fun action sequences, a good storyline with unpredictable (relatively)twists. It was fun for the family and we still quote the game today. We've owned it for 3 years and played it through many times. I wish there would be a follow on, because the characters were great."
5,adjustable weights,My husband was looking for an adjustable weight set that included individual weights for both ankles and that went up to 10 lbs. each. These fit the bill.
3,No Garth Brooks,"Very disappointed that the Garth Brooks version of To make you feel my love is not included. It was on the original tape cartridge version. O.K., Trisha Yearwoods version is nice, but when one thinks this particular soundtrack--well, where is Garth Brooks?"
5,"Sweet movie,even sweeter music.",I can watch this movie over and over and now I listen to the music over and over. All the music is great on this cd. Very comforting lovely music.
2,Searching for peace and greater knowledge of the unknown.,"This is a story of a person departing from their faith at a very young age and later exploring other belief systems and being confused and overwhelmed spiritually in the process. The events move mainly through the dark side of spiritual experiences and leaving the person feeling empty and alone. She finally reached a belief system that worked for her in reaching spiritual peace. The story continues with her sharing her solution as ""the way"" for the utlimate answer. It deals with obsessions and isolation in the experiences and in the solution. A good read for those in the Psychological field."
3,Camera bag for Nikon D300,"I got the bag in good time and good condition. It was a bit smaller than I imagined it to be. Not quite the 5 lenses it was advertised to be (unless very small and short lenses). I had trouble fitting a D300 camera, SB flash, 18-200 lens and a f1.8 50mm lens. It was a very tight fit. Zippers are a bit tight as well. Overall, seems like construction though."
1,Not Enough Bag for Camera & Accessories,"Unfortunately when I tried to fit all parts into this bag, I had a lot leftover that wouldn't fit. My inventory includes:Nikon D4018-135 lens70-300 lensNikon SB flash lightKodak point n shootcharger for AA batteriesNikon remotelens hoodsmanualsI won't say that I couldn't fit my items inside, because I could get in the camera and lenses. But if I'd wanted to tote my stock lens, 18-55, there would have been no room. I also keep my 18-135 on my camera. When I pull my camera out of its little hammock space, the lens gets caught and is pulled out at length. Doesn't feel very safe.But my main issue was having nowhere to store my manuals, which are always very important to have on hand.So after fiddling with the bag a bit, working on random item combinations, I decided that it just wasn't going to work out and returned the item to Amazon. It's not a bad bag in general, just a bad one for me. Perhaps the next buyer will be a better match."
3,Difficult reading,If the repetition of praise for Allah was deleted this book would be about 1/5th its size. A hard read!!
2,Qur'an,"The book is in good shape, The content is very complicated containing thousands of orders, do's and don's, seemingly dealing in all subjects. I have no idea of how muslims can make head or tail of if. I was just curious and will try to read it a bit more."
1,Upsetting,"I really tried to go into this book with an open mind. I'm not a christian nor do I claim any religion, however, I do like to read and research each religion just for the sake of knowledge. I feel badly and almost embarrassed to say that I couldn't even make it past the first 100 pages in this book. The hatred of women and the condoning of barbaric slaughter simply because someone doesn't believe what this book says is a bit much for me. I really wanted to learn alot from this book. I understand there are extremists and moderates of the religion and such. But the way I see if is if the book itself wasn't so violent then there wouldn't be a need to label an extremist or a moderate, there would just be muslims. Good luck with your read."
2,None,There is nothing particarly interesting or new to be found in this extremely limited account of Shakespeare's life and times. It was't even proofread carefully enough to correct an egregious sentence fragment. Not worth even $.99.
2,The Angry Young Man,"when i first started reading poetry, stuff like this used to impress me to no end. then as i read different kinds of stuff, i realized poetry was more than just attacking ""the man,"" and telling people how much you hate america. medina's shtick gets old quick and i didn't bother to finish the book. i'm not a card carrying republican, but i've got other issues to deal with in my life...."
5,Awesome,The truth about Mr. Jackson finally comes out in Mr. Timmerman's outstanding and well-documented book which exposes Jesse Jackson for the disgusting me-firster that he is. A must read.
5,Shakedown puts it all in perspective-now I know,"I have always wondered how a guy like Jesse Jackson makes a living. Now I know. A follow-up would be why the media and politicians let him get away with these tactics. Great reading, well documented facts, and is detailed enough to make the point and leave it to the reader to deal with the facts as he/she wishes.It has been said that politics is legalized crime. Shakedown shows the politics of Jesse Jackson."
4,Just What I Thought...,"Only now it's confirmed... from Jackson's own mouth!He's a sleazy scavenger of human misery who has strong-armed his way to the forefront of black politics.I feel sorry for his victims; naive black citizens who really believe that Jesse Jackson has their best interests at heart.I feel anger because of the political, judicial and social kowtowing that has allowed someone this amoral and greedy to operate his criminal enterprises for so long.Shame on you Jesse."
1,Much longer than it needed to be.,"The amount of research that went into this book is extraordinary but I found myself reading page after page of minutiae expecting a blockbuster conclusion only to be repeatedly let down by the relative insignificance of the material. This book could have been much better (and much, much shorter) if it focused upon the important matters. I suffered through the first half of the book and ultimately decided to give up on it."
4,I passed,"This book really did help me prepare for the CLEP despite being outdated. Some of the information it gives you about the test is wrong - it is now better to guess at the answers than to leave them blank. I used other online resources to study also, but this book was great to have. I studied for several hours, once or twice a week, over the course of 2 month. I got the last 6 credits I needed to graduate, and got my diploma in the mail last week. :)"
3,Good review book,"I purchased this book to review high school mathematics after being out of high school for over 10 years. It was a wonderful way to refresh my memory. Since I have no intention of taking the CLEP exam, I cannot vouch for its effectiveness for CLEP preparation but I can honestly say that if you are unsure of your level of mathematics aptitude or require a quick review this book is excellent. However, if you are looking for in depth explanations and need to be taught these concepts for the first time, it is not suited to this purpose. It is an excellent skeletal review book."
3,Just Another Dust Collector,"While this is a cute little beanie - it's not really a fun to play with. It's been sitting on the shelf looking cute, but that's about it. If you're looking to have a nice little addition to a gift basket, it's a nice little finishing touch."
3,Epson ELPHB550,The item recieved was not as pictured. I have not mounted the projector yet and am debating on doing so as the mount shipped is rather ugly. The mount shipped while still having the EPSON ELPHB550 part number looks nothing like the item shown in the sale. Also note the mount is ugly beige in color (like a really old computer).
2,Disappointing.,"Most of the cases described in this book were decades old and previously published elsewhere. The author's main contribution was to categorize synopses of numerous ufo encounters. I didn't find any new conclusions or insights. And, by the way, if Richard F. Haines, Ph.D. happens to read this: ""I think therefore I am"" is generally attributed to Descartes -- not Plato."
5,I have used these for many yers,"and they have never let me down! My ears use to ache after every flight. No more! they still stop up slightly, but not as bad as the days before I discovered these."
2,"Ok, here goes....","First off, I would like to say that my heart goes out to Jenifer and I did tear up at certain times, especially the end. But I am reviewing a book, so here goes...like other readers I really could've done without the family flashbacks, I just didn't care. I really wanted this book to focus on her diagnosis and more how she dealt with the fact that she was going to die. However, I found that this book focused on other people in her life A LOT...her sisters, friends, and honestly I just wanted to hear from her and how she was feeling. I just skimmed through most of the book to get to the end."
5,Still thinking about this book,"This book made me laugh and broke my heart simultaneously. From it, I learned how a terrifying disease - ALS - can be tackled with humor, vigor and, most importantly, the enduring love of three incredible sisters."
4,Works fine for me!,"Just picked this up recently and find that it works fine with my Audiovox CDM9500. I wanted something small, push to talk (even works well for voice dialing), cheap, and did not require shoving a foreign object into my ear canal. The volume could be a little higher in the earpiece, but the mic works fine and it is comfortable to wear. Under normal conditions (walking, sitting in the car) it works fine. It will fall out if you jog or whip your head back and forth violently, but who does that when talking on the phone?"
1,"wow, so lame","first of all...i truly don't recommend buying this book. It really doesn't help at all for most parts. Sure it got all the items and stuff but most of it, it doesn't tell you how to get them and the walk through are so lame....geeshFor those wishes to buy the book..all i can say is good luck getting your money worth"
3,Cisco Firewall ASA-5505,Good unit when working. Packed up for no reason after about a week. Called Cisco and they did not have Amazon as an authorized re-seller so no support was offered.Contacted Amazon and they replaced it the next day.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON,"The product failed after only 8 months of operation.Called Cisco. They refuse to support the product and will not even talk to the customer because it was purchased through Amazon.Called Amazon. They are currently giving me the run around.Very unhappy customer!For all the satisfaction this product will bring you, you may as well flush your $300+ down the toilet!"
2,"2 stars for the acting, Movie was DUMB","the acting was not bad, the very very end was pretty good , but, the rest of the movie sucked and was pretty boring. How these people rated it 4/5 stars i wont ever understand. This is another movie i brought and sold with in days. The idea of the story is not bad but this kid is talking to the devil through a computer. I dont know the movie just sucked , IMO atleast. What i would advise anyone to do is rent it b4 you buy it or find it used for like 6$ so if you dont like it atleast you only spent $6 instead of 15 or 20 $."
2,Coolpix5700 Faulty Flash Problem,"Cons: My husband and I purchased the 5700 in September 2002, making our decision only after reading all the ""glowing"" reviews on this ""overly priced"" camera. Now, don't get me wrong, the picture quality is great, however, one would think the internal flash would last a bit longer than six-months! I tried everything to restore it to the manufacturer setting - nothing worked! We ended up having to purchase a disposal camera to take indoor shots of our sons wedding in Alaska, which will probaby be a once in a lifetime trip for us! As for the batteries, better buy extra and get the charger for your cigarette lighter while your at it. You never know where you might be when your battery goes dead and you miss that all to awesome shot!Pros: Good photo qualityBottom line: Buy anything else but the 5700!"
1,dead pixels,"I bought this camera brand new and after a week I realized that when I take pictures, in some spots there are dead pixels that are very obvious to the naked eye. Gradually over time, more pixels are getting defective."
1,bad camera from a company like nikon,"Used the camera for abt 2 years, without any problem, was very happy..and suddenly there was no picture/image shown in the lcd or the view finder.. like the lense cap is on or something,, while the camera is on.. it just shows the menu settings. but does not show any image.someone told me , i might have tried to take the battery out while keeping the camera in ""ON"" position.. this might damage the circuit..I cant believe it, i mean so many people can do that either un-knowingly or just by mistake or in a hurry/rush ..if this is a real cause of the problem i am having , then this is utterly riduculous.. and i cant expect this from a company like nikon.. i waited for almost 2 years to buy a good camera, and when i finally had money i bought this one .."
3,a dollar,I found these emory boards a couple days later at the dollar store for a dollar. a dollar. that's it.
3,Fine but not wonderful,"The watch is good and for 75 box I recomended the phurchase, but you can see tehe same watch in a regular store for 115 box so you dont have really the discount the say in the web. The ligh is almost to see the watch in the dark, because during the day you can't see anything (i see perfectly every other things)"
4,Pulsar Watch,"Pretty nice watch, looks and feels good. Also the price was pretty good compared with department stores."
3,"Nice Watch, Battery Sucks","I got this watch because 1) It is a pulsar, 2) because it looks nice, and 3) because it seemed to have some brains behind the looks. Well, the Pulsar brand has lost some luster because I found this watch to be less than impressive in the brains department, and I have never, ever had a watch with such a poor battery life.If I knew at the time of purchase how bad the battery was, I would out right not purchase it again. I have about 12 watches, all of which are older than this watch.. all of whom have older batteries than this watch, yet the battery on this watch has died twice. Awesome."
3,Some Pop Music History...,"I'll agree with most of the reviewers here that Thicke's got a good voice, and that ""When I Get You Alone"" is a decent song. It's danceable, funky, and well-produced.On the other hand, people who like this song should go back and listen to Walter Murphy's ""A Fifth of Beethoven"" from the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. ""When I Get You Alone"" samples that song, not Beethoven (directly at least). You can actually play both songs at once and they are pretty much exactly the same. You can sing Thicke's words over top of the Murphy song and it works perfectly. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this, but it's simply not as original as some might think."
2,Just buy the single & save money!,"Save yourself some money and just buy the single of ""When I get You Alone"" if you were thinking of buying this cd.I think the lyrics to all the rest of the songs are boring, unimaginative and the music is not very catchy either."
3,Cool and Fun,"Overall I thought it was a fun album with cool sound. Some of his lyrics, though, can be silly sometimes."
5,Thanks Amazon,"a great source of history, i need to find out more and more of these types of books and video materials as history is really a great learning tool for me, Thanks amazon, you're doing a good job."
2,The Binding,"The binding of this book is absolutely unacceptable for one being sold for more than $100. Inside a hardcover, SEPARATELY CUTTED pages (no 64-page blocks!) are united by some sort of glue. This book will start to disintagrate to a pile of leafs after few days of reading. That is not the book for which one pays >$100."
1,Save Your Money,This DVD is a huge disappointment. The video is pathetic and the audio is nothing compared to the CD. I could not take it and switched it off during the 3rd song. I am glad I have the CD to enjoy.
2,lame!,"thank god i didnt pay money for these...crappy adhesive. probably better than nothing, but will fall off by themselves with a few bumps."
5,An excellent concert recording microphone,"I use this, along with a home-built preamp and a Sony MiniDisc deck, to tape live concerts of my band and others. It does a very good job. The microphone has low self noise, a good stereo image, and excellent frequency response. Since it's single point stereo, it's easy to set up."
2,Poor Representation,"My initial exposure to Nir Maman was through youtube. He appeared to be very talented and his video represented what I thought were excerpts from his DVD series. They were not. The DVD series is a very poor representation of Maman's abilities and I think his teaching skills. The information was sub standard at best. He is a very knowledgeable instructor and had the opportunity to truly represent these skills. In this DVD series he did neither. I am uncertain if this is the classic ""marketing scheme"" of showing ""sort of"" Krav Maga or IDF techniques, all the while knowingly giving very convoluted information and not staying true to really putting the information out there. ""Krav Maga"" is the new buzz word and it appears that this is a money maker and not a true representation of the system. Krav Maga is a very effective and well thought out program. These DVD's do not show how good the system or how effective the IDF and Israeli methods are. Very disappointed."
3,Not in depth enough and no really unifying thread,"I think the authors were writing this to be used as a textbook for a business class. There was no message beyond Hello Kitty is sucessful. Yeah, I figured that out from the title. Additionally, many details were repeated in multiple chapters. Overall there was no unifying thread from the authors. They didn't tell us their interpretation of why Hello Kitty was successful or how it came to be in their opinion. It was interesting but not earth shattering."
4,A must read for any hello kitty lover,"Im a huge hello kitty fan. This book is an excellent insite to not only the booming success of hello kitty, but japanese pop culture in general."
2,Please distinguish between 1st and 2nd edition,This listing does not distinguish between 1995 and 2002 editions. There are important improvements in the 2002 edition. Please help!
1,"There are good surprises, and there are bad surprises...","Call me homophobic if you will, but I was entirely grossed out by ""the big surprise"" of this film. Oh, it started out OK, but I seriously can't recommend this one to anybody, unless you find yourself attracted to transvestites --- in which case this flick is for you!!!"
3,OK,"I had been hearing about this movie for years and couldn't find it anywhere to rent. Finally, I just bought it. I don't know what all the fuss was about. It's an ok movie. I may trade it in somewhere along with 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag."
1,dvd is annoying,This DVD starts with a super noisey sound effect's demo. This was really annoying. The movie was pretty much down hill from there.On Par with other movies which have promotional materials mentioning Oscar nominations; Very boring.
5,The best British movie in the 90's.,"Not enough great things can be said about 'The Crying Game'-Neil Jordan's mastepiece. The whole movie is incredibly beautiful from start to finish. (I regretted missing this movie in the theater dismissing this as 'gender bender flick.') Honestly, I can compare 'The Crying Game' to 'Vertigo.' Just think it takes more than 20 years for mass (including most moronic critics) to appreciate 'Vertigo.'"
3,"Great movie, bad presentation on DVD","This is truly a great film. However, you have to view it with distracting shimmerings and other irritations here. Did no one take a look at this DVD before releasing it? If not for the widescreen, I'd prefer my VHS."
5,"""THRILLING AND HAUNTING FROM START TO FINISH!""","This edge-of-your-seat chilling romantic thriller became a huge hit on the Big Screen. A breathtaking Masterpiece that entertains from start to finish. Jaye Davidson is Stunning, Acting Performance of cast was Superb, and the story is Intoxicating! Irish Terrorists take a hostage as the drama begins, then becomes intense throughout. Action-Packed, Mesmerizing, sizzling, and enjoyable. A Must-own film for thriller lovers. Highly Recommended!"
4,Almost Great,"Well, like other BET productions, this one has very nice video and DTS audio. Video still suffers from occasional shots of a completely dark crowd. Audio gripes include lame sounding saxaphone (D. Matthews Band - Live from Central Park is reference standard)My main disappointment is that Keiko doesn't play the REAL PIANO on more tracks. I think about 5 tracks have real piano. It is very well recorded and beautiful sounding. Unfortunately all the other tracks feature electronic synth piano which pales in comparison.Highlight is the gentleman playing the oriental flute. Wonderfully recorded. Fabulous control over the instrument.Overall 4/5 due to the sax recording quality and the lack of more tracks with the majestic sounding real piano."
1,A disappointing and cliche-ridden suspense novel,"This is a book that started out promising to be an interesting read, but quickly degenerated into one of those ""I know I'm wasting my time, but maybe something interesting will happen in the next chapter"" books. I was especially disappointed in the ending, where the conclusion became a promo for Hoag's sequel novel. I'll pass on the sequel. The characters were cliches of characters from bad TV series: The tough but tender-hearted cop with a secret in his past, the tough but vulnerable female cop who falls for the tough but tender-hearted cop, etc. Hoag tries to spice it up with some mild sex scenes, but in the end you wonder what these two cops see in each other -- with as many hang-ups and pieces of emotional baggage they're carrying, it's a wonder they're able to function"
2,Not so good,"I too kept thinking ""I'll keep reading, maybe something exciting will happen"". The book was way too long and I really felt taken when I reached the end only to find you have to buy another book to find out the details of what really happened"
3,"Had me, then lost me!","Night Sins by Tami Hoag is a suspenseful as well as a typical novel. The beginning is a twisted mass of information that finally (half way into the book!) comes to a common point that ends in the dissapointment of finding you have to purchase the sequal book to find any closure. Not a good move by Ms. Hoag. She had me hooked half way through, but now has lost me as a follower of her writing by pulling this stunt; good writer, bad technique"
3,A quick read but disappointing ending,I was able to read the book in an afternoon but i was confused and disappointed with the ending.
3,Way to abridged - in the audio version,"Let me start by saying that had this book been a longer version or even an unabridged story I might have given it a 4 or 5. My problem is that with the abridgement it was way to abridged. I felt like I was missing half of the story! Though the narrator did a good job with the information they had.Meet Megan O'Malley the newest Criminal Apprehension Agent in northern MN, and the first woman ever in this position, which seems to be an uphill battle for the start. On her first day in Deerlake not only does she meet the Sheriff in his underwear but also she is drawn into a kidnapping before she has even finished dinner.The story that issues is a fast paced and thrilling suspenseful story that I might have to go buy the book for to see what I missed with the abridgement."
1,didnt receive,"I never received my order. 3 weeks later, it was cancelled because the 9 books I ordered couldnt be delivered by the persons I ordered from.So,I have no idea how the book is, or the other 8!"
1,Boring and contrived,"This is a book that should not be set aside lightly. It should be thrown ... with great force. I bought this book while on vacation, just looking for a little mindless escape. I had just finished reading the latest from Jeffrey Deaver, so I was in the mood for another good mystery. This one isn't. The characters are cardboard, the romance is corny and contrived, and the plot - such as it is - just plods on. I kept thinking that it would get better if I just kept going a little bit further, but found myself skipping whole paragraphs until I finally gave up after 116 pages. That's when I turned to the Amazon reviews and my suspicions were confirmed. And to think that there's a sequel that's even slower than this!"
2,"Good story, but too long and now forced to buy another book!","Book had a fair story with ""red herrings"" thrown to the reader that were never picked up by the characters. Too much description and what the characters were thinking and not enough action. I was disappointed that to find out really what happened I need to buy another book. If I had known this in the beginning perhaps I would have bought them both. I will buy the second book just to see if my conclusions are correct or if the author succeded in finding a way to twist the plot"
2,I think this book was not good at all.,This book had no action whatsoever. All the book was was talking. This book would be good for people who don`t like action at all. The only part good in the book was at the very last pages. If I had a choice I would not read that book agian. It would probably be good for girls.
4,Harsh,"This book is a love story about a towny who falls in love with a fancy pancy richy girl. He uses his grandfather to impress her but learns of a twisted story his grandfather hides in his past. This is a very thrilling and mushy book. It can haunt with the events, or it can please you in its love story. Either way it is pretty good. I will not give it 5 stars because of some of the events and the mention of Holocaust. It can be scary. I was required to read this in 7th grade and I enjoyed it along with 75% of my class whereas the other 25% hated it."
2,YUCK,God shoot those poor things!!! The director absolutely SCREWED THE TURTLES UP!!! They look so much like frogs!!!!!! The animatronics make me cry!!!! The voices kill me literally!!!! Splinter I want to SHOOT because he's so horrible in this movie! The only reason I didn't give this a 1 star is because of Yoshi (he's so adorable!) and Casey Jones and the four Japanese dudes. April was somebody I wanted to just slaughter with a mace. Has anyone noticed that she changes personality in all three?? Nope. Don't like NT 3. But the ninja/karate moves are pretty cool. Either than that....put this thing out of its misory.
5,STILL FUNNY!,THIS MOVIE IS NOT SO BAD AS EVERYONE SAID IT WAS. IT'S A GREAT MOVIE WHICH HAS EVERYTHING AND IS'NT AS BORING AS THE FIRST TWO. IT'S A GREAT MOVIE!
5,a classic,i love this comic movie one i am into super hero movies and comic books. when i was young this was popular. there was even a TV show from the 80's to the 90's. in this movie they got to go back in time to ancient japan. to fix the wrong going on.
3,"Handy, but some of the shelves don't fit","Easy install, and good use of space. My only complaint is that a few of the shelves didn't fit. One of them in particular was a good 2"" wider than it needed to be in order to fit in the corner. It was impossible to use that shelf without pulling the wire cutters out."
5,Get it,Had a great time watching this classic also got the newer version. Both should be in your collections despite the fact they are the same story they were done 40 years apart and different enough to not loose your interest.
4,Good resource,"It's a good resource, wish there were some forms to use for gathering info and presenting it to executives."
2,This thing is loud!!!,"If you have an apartment and are concerned at all about disturbing your neighbors during early hours, you may not want to buy this gadget ... it's VERY LOUD!! The 10 seconds or so of beeping prior to the spraying is nearly as loud as an alarm clock, and the spray action motor itself is definitely about as loud as your typical kitchen blender. The jury is still out on its ability to clean."
2,Disappointed,"It didn't hold on true porcelian, only on a form of other materials. I let it dry overnight as directed, also tried it a second time on clean peaces of porcelian. I was truly disappointed."
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS,"First, I want to say that I do not put up many comments on Amazon, but this seller deserves a whopper. My son opened this present on Christmas morning. The box had been damaged on each corner when I recieved it, but I was hopeful about it being only cosmetic. Nope. He opened it up and the can of dried bugs was crushed and the label torn off, like it got CHEWED. When we tried to put batteries in and realized that the batteries in the remote were leaking from sitting too long. Needless to say, this is a hunk of junk...even if it did originally work it was an embarassing gift to give. This must had been returned and sold again."
2,Not the best,"This DVD was just very dull. I got it for my son when he was a little over 1 1/2 years old and he never watched more than a few minutes of it at a time. Naturally babies don't focus for long, but he will sit and watch several minutes of Dora and other shows like that which are designed to hold a child's attention.Honestly I also found the DVD quite boring and never watched the entire thing either. I also tried to play it for my 4 year old nephew and he hated it."
5,This book has been a LIFE SAVER,"I am a graduate student, and my master's thesis/experiment is on prosocial behavior. I can't even imagine how many painful hours of random Google Scholar and PsychInfo searches this book has saved me. The authors literally did hundreds of hours of work FOR me; I feel like I should send them an envelope full of cash... I won't... but I should."
3,Not so mini,The clips are pretty big so you can't get them into a lot of areas you would typically use a mini-clip for. The wires are pretty thick too. This is less problematic. They are OK but now what I expected.
2,Very cheap,Wow! These really are cheap junk. Unfortuntely the only good mini-grabber test leads I can find cost $44 for ten of them.I should have known better. Now I will have to order the better ones anyway and either waste my time returning these or wasted my money and throw them in my junk pile.
2,Lonely Planet Panama,"After I bought this book I borrowed the Moon guidebook to Panama from the library. By the time I was finished with both, the Lonely Planet guide was black in the margins and index from all the stuff that was left out. The writer seems unaware of Chagres National Park, the main ferry landing to go to Bocas Islands, how to get around without a car, and so on."
5,Love it!,It's unfortunate not more people view Austin City Limits program. Not all their videos are readily available and I was thrilled to find this one. A terrific concert and this live Billy video is certainly one of his best. Worth every penny.
5,More,"This was great a great Video performance Idol at his best even at 58 he kicks some serious A**Give ME MORE, MORE, MORE"
2,Could be better!,"This blu ray have good image quality, but not so good in sound quality. The Billy Idol voice's sounds not so good. About the tracks, only have 3 musics that I like, it's missing the better ones from Billy Idol (e.g. sweet sixteen, rock this city, etc...) It's also a small concert for a blu ray disc (only 70 minutes of music)."
3,Fade?,I was really disappointed that Fade was not included on the CD. That was one of their biggest hits. Perhaps the band doesn't like that track as much. It would have been a stronger effort with Fade.
2,shake your money maker richard better than rebellion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this is a better more compact book than rebellion i just about gave up on this series after reading the tripe in the previous novel as a bsg fan this is more closer to what i expect however once again we have misspelled words and paragraphs that meander abit if i have to read he cried one more time in any book well at least my door now has a paper weight i feel sorry for those who paid $23.95 for rebellion us dollars as well i at least got it used thank the lords of kobol this is a better effort and as an adult reading this i dont feel like im five again please get better editors or at least someone who is literate!!!!!! there is alot of potential in this series and with this book i hope it starts to head in the right direction a quick read as well rebellion i had to grind my teeth a day of my life wasted which i will never get back a better effort hope the rest of the novels improve as well.
2,Song from the Forest: My Life Among the Ba-Benjelle Pygmies,"As a source of information on this group pygmies and their music this book is worth plowing through to almost the end.While Louis Sarno does not have a captivating style of writing, the book does provide a unique perspective of one man's journey in Central Africa to find the Ba-benjelle pygmies and their music.The sections on the dances, hunting, bees and duikers, etc. are interesting enough to keep one reading. The section on his love/obsession for Ngbali alternatly leaves you wishing he would succeed,scream exploitation and wondering if he really thought he wasn't being used. It is at this point, one wants to skip the last 40 or so pages.The bottom line is make the effort to discover his journey and then go buy the music. You will be glad you did."
2,Shabby Feathers,"I ordered these for my two year old son to wear on a parade float with the theme of ""Little Angels."" The wings are rigid construction and they fit him well, unfortunately they arrived with about one third of the feathers badly frayed. A couple of feathers are missing the tips as if they have been chewed on. I am very disappointed with the quality of the feathers."
3,Used it to take Infant pictures,"I used this to take baby pictures, and it worked. It looks and feels fragile, but other than that it does the trick."
1,Look elsewhere!,"These wings DO NOT look like the picture. They are simply cardboard arches with feathers stuck on, they are not shaped like the picture but rather straight up/down from top to bottom not flared as shown. They have to elastic loops in the center for the kids to put their arms through and they continuously slide down their arms. My 3 yr old hated these and took them off half way through trick or treating. For the price I thought they would be a little better construction."
5,A classic comedy,"My husband and I love this movie! Bad language, so it is not for the youngsters in your home. This is truly one of the funniest, kick back movies around with a great turn of events."
4,My favorite comedy movie,This is my favorite comedy movie of all time. Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei are hilarious. You will laugh from begining to end.The only reason why I don't give this DVD a 5 star is becaues of the movie previews. Cmon if I buy a dvd I want to go directly to the movie and features not to see a bunch of movie previews that I don't care about.
5,My Cousin Vinny,This is the funniest movie I've ever seen. This is definitely my favorite comedy movie.
2,average could have been better,this film would have been really good if it weren't for the two films in one.who thought of putting Ralph Macchio in a film? Joe Pesci&Marisa Tomei have chemistry and that saves the film.if the film had have focused on them it would have been a must have.but overall it's average.
5,Very funny,I highly recommend this movie you will laugh again and again every time watching it it has a little drama and lots of funny parts I was laughing my head off
3,"Great movie!!!, however I wish I could wash their mouths out with soap","This movie is so clever and funny. We love the story. However I couldn't give it five stars because of the language. It really was unnecessary to the story and without it my whole family could have enjoyed it. And yes I lived in Philly, I know that's how they talk, but the story didn't have to imitate real life there. And most decent Italians will watch their mouths when kids or others they don't want to offend are around: ""Yo! Watch your mouth!"" ""You kiss your mother with that mouth?"" are things I heard there all the time. It's about respect. They could have pretended kids were watching when they made this movie - and then maybe kids could have been!"
2,"Don't, don't, don't take this advice...","... unless you're an addled headed twit from WeHo or Chelsea. And it's 1990. And even then it's bad advice. The free sample was great fun, reminding me of misspent days gone by. But then I bought it and it rapidly went downhill. On the other hand, if you take any of this seriously, you'll end up end up in therapy for relationship and sex issues which will probably be good in the long run and in rehab for your drinking and eventually AA which, I hear, is an excellent place to meet great guys."
4,"Intriguing, well acted but must like deep psychological films","This is a fine movie for those who are sensitive or can deal with astra-physical images. A somewhat happily married woman with a domineering coldinsenstive husbsnd and lovely kids suffers from MS. Her husband lets 3 academy students live in one br and is demanding that they study. One falls behind. The lady, seeking to find more meaning in her life starts tutoring him on the side. This relieves her depression. But after this is stopped, she suffers an unknown illness. Countless tests show nothing.HerMD suggests one risky option. The husband coldly refuses but later, after seeing some sensitivity as his wife slips away in a coma, goes along.She is in between life and death. If you enjoy this review, watch the movie. If not, stop and go to other fare."
3,Basic lock for a decent price.,"Contrary to other reviews my locks internals are pretty rough. It took a bit of effort to get the key in the first few times and unlocking was quite ""clunky"" before I broke out the oil. It feels solid and looks decent but having done a bit of research it seems to be a fairly easy lock to pick. I bought this to keep prying eyes out of my ammunition and am confident it will fulfill that roll but I wouldn't trust it with anything really valuable."
2,Not what i had hoped for,I had hoped this product would improve or eliminate some of my spider veins..it did not.
4,Highly Recommend This!,"I would have given Five Stars if this came in Black, to match my monitor and most monitors in the market now. But I recommend this to everyone! So easy to attach even to my flat screen monitor. I had such a hard time finding this 19 inch size, and I travel between Asia and the US. I finally had to shop online and this is the best deal I found. For the price, I am so happy...and most of all, my eye-strain and headache is gone from my computer use."
5,Exactly what I've been looking for.....,"This book will be perfect for my 9 yr old and I to use as we discuss her next few years. It is so clear and written at a level she will surely understand. I have read MANY MANY books but they all mesh this topic in along with topics which are too old for a 9 yr old. However three of her friends have already started so she needs to be informed now.As everyone has mentioned the text and drawings are very clear. I was afraid I would have to sketch things out for her - but not now since it's all here. The more teenage topic is quickly referenced on two separate pages in this book - but if she asks I will just say it's for a later discussion. I will be using this book along with Nancy Rue's ""The Body Book, It's a God Thing"". Both of these books are very well suited for a 9 yr old.I passed on ""The Care and Keeping of You"" and ""Ready, Set, Grow"" for adding in too much information that young girls don't need at ages 9 or 10."
4,Great Book for Pre Teen Girls,I bought this book for my daughter when she was 11 right after her first period. She was very happy to have it and carried it around for days reading and re-reading it. She shared it with several of her classmates and one even kept it all summer. She happily got it back (in a very used state) and is referencing it again. I tried to prepare her for the changes but this book covered things I forgot (which she was quick to point out). I recommend this for any parent who wants their daughter to have a clear and concise guide of what to expect with puberty.
2,Eco-disaster book which struck me as unduly pesimistic,I read this as a required reading at high school and am interested in rereading it as I think futurologistists do not have their predictions tested.
5,Zip Pip Kaboodle!,"I am 3 years old and I LOVE this book. I can't believe that all my friends don't have this book. It is my favorite book to give at birthday parties. My mother appreciates the beautiful illustrations, especially the slumbering moon."
4,Better than studio recordings,"It somehow has been quite hard for me to listen to, say, 15 Free songs in a row. Don't know why but there are not too many studio versions of their best songs that I really enjoy. Other songs usually just pass by and I barely notice them. However, most bands of the 70s were a sight to see (and hear) during their live shows. Turns out Free were exactly that way. I have to say that I keep returning to this album time after time and still find it great. Would recommend this instead of any other ""regular"" album. Most of the songs on this album sound different, more interesting and stronger than the original studio versions."
1,Did she read the book?,"Wagner-Martin's guide to The Poisonwood Bible was a disappointment. I had read the novel and I bought Wagner-Martin's book hoping to catch points that I had missed and get a better understanding of the book. Wagner-Martin did bring out some parts of the novel that I had missed and for that I am grateful. But she also got some parts of the book absolutely wrong. Most importantly, she mis-identified the village witch doctor and the person who put a snake in the chicken house which killed the youngest daughter. The fact Wagner-Martin gets confused over the plot seriously undermines her ability to guide any reader through an absolutely wonderful novel."
1,Motor died within first hour of operation,"I took a chance, ordering this compressor from Amazon. Price was right and I _thought_ Campbell Hausfeld was a quality brand. The process of ordering from Amazon was straight forward. But the compressor was damaged when delivered. An air filter was crushed. Amazon doesn't handle part replacements, so I had the choice of shipping it back to them for a replacement (300lb compressor on a pallet) or they would refund me the cost of purchasing the replacement air filter. I chose that, but then after running the compressor for less than an hour, the electric motor blew up. It makes a horendous screetching noise when running. But unfortunately since it's past 30 days, I have to deal with the manufacturer (no credit for the time spent waiting for the damaged filter element, which prevented the unit from being run). All in all, I'm receiving fairly poor service on what appears to be total junk.lesson learned, should've gone to a local tool supplier."
3,Awkward Mechanically,"Although this camera takes excellent pictures, I find it mechanically awkward to use. The left half of the camera must be pivoted forward from top to straight ahead in order to find the subject in the lens. Also the flash is located on that left pivotal half, so one must be careful to not be placing fingers on top of the flash when taking a picture. For quickness in shooting ""unreinactable"" pictures these mechanics are frustrating. Anyone with lack of dexterity may find this camera a problem as I do. I would suggest that anyone buying this as a gift be certain the receiver goes along! These mechanics may be uncomfortable to them--This is not user friendly for one who just wants to ""point and shoot"". For this price I would like to see it more user friendly and less mechanical!"
2,Huge shutter lag,"The shutter lag is too great for me to efficiently use this camera. Nikon support's solution is to prefocus, by pressing the shutter release button half way. I found this to be inadequate, as it means I can't take any spontaneous photos (I tried, the object is always out of the frame)."
1,Awful movie,"This is the worst movie that I have seen in many years.Dark, depressing and totally pointless."
4,My son loves Wally,My Son adores these books and keeps him entertained for long periods. I recommend this for parents looking for an activity for their kids. 4 stars from me.
4,Awesome thing!,"i LIKE books. and i like finding Waldo because Waldo is awesome, and so are books. AWESOME!! very ridiculuously cool and stuff"
4,My 3-year old's favorite.,"Entertaining for both children and adults. This book is full of visual puns and amusing drawings like a flying Ace (of spades) and a human snowball. Long after we've found Waldo everywhere, we're still seeing something new and surprising. This is a great (but slightly bulky) book to keep kids entertained on long trips."
4,john wayne gives the marines air support,"typical world war two aviation yarn starring the duke as the tough as nails squadron commander. good supporting cast. a plus for the film is the fact that its shot in color, a rarity for this type of film at the time. if you like john wayne and ww2, you'll like flying leathernecks"
5,Great Value!,This is a great value. I own a childrens clothing boutique. I sew all the items myself & use a lot of elastic. The elastic is great quality. The shipping was fast as well. I will definately order again.
3,Not as good as some of her others,"I like Marcy Stewart, based on reading Charity's Gambit, and My Lord Footman. Those were, in my estimation, 4 star books. However, this one didn't please me in the same way. I never really got into the characters or grew to care for them. I felt that too much time was spent on dealing with the ""mystery"" of who the baby was, and all that. The romance wasn't developed fully enough. I wish more time had been spent showing how the hero and heroine grew to care for each other. There wasn't anything terrible wrong with this book, but I just found it didn't hold my attention, and although I have kept the other books I mentioned, I discarded this one. A light read--not bad, but ""nothing to write home about!"""
5,A superb ending,"Worth it just for the ""surprise"" ending of the last episode of Season 3. The production of the Season 3 DVDs are among the highest quality I have encountered. In my humble opinion, the boys & girls down at Mainframe Entertainment should have just let the series end here. The two ""Season 4"" movies are sub-par and unnecessary (again, IMHO)."
2,Mostly fluff,"Most of this book is an overblown discussion of Kegel exercises, that could have been reduced to no more than a chapter. Other books give this topic better treatment, too. Too much motivational nonsense, and not enough substance."
5,Beautiful brushstrokes are what have drawn me to this art,I've enjoyed this style and admired it for many years and look forward to painting more in this style. The book is well laid out and I love the step by step instructions and pictures. I gave this rating also because of the quality of the pages and color. Thank you
2,No Subtitles!!!,"This is a GREAT FILM!!! So why did they fail to add subtitles to the Region 1 DVD (maybe another Region has English subtitles?) What a shame, because the English dubbing is serviceable, but not great. Dubbing is always generally going to be inferior to subtitles, though both options should be available. The DVD only has the original German language (no subs) and English (dubbed. The film deserves a 5 out of 5, but the DVD gets a 2 for lack of subtitles. And for lack of any background info on the movie or the true story it is based on. It was based on the ""Stern"" book, ""Christiane F. - wir kinder vom bahnhof zoo"", transcripted and edited from tape recordings by Kai Hermann & Horst Rieck. There should have been an effort to give more background extras since this film is a GREAT German film, a standout, and I would have loved to have seen more on it. But I can't recommend the DVD - I would wait for a re-issue WITH SUBTITLES."
4,Harrowing ordeal,"...as any good movie that explores the world of drug addiction should be. Quite graphic in its depiction of the consequences of drug addiction, and the heartbreaking, and seemingly unbreakable, bonds involved. Just when you think someone is about to break free, they get sucked back in. Very sad, and frustrating.About as searingly graphic, if not more, as ""Requiem for a Dream"", another excellent movie that should convince anyone who watches it to avoid the scourge that is drugs. Another movie you wouldn't want to watch too frequently, due to its gruesome honesty and the fact that the images are burned into your brain.Excellent soundtrack from David Bowie, including live concert footage. Most of the songs are from his ""Heroes"" album, which was written and recorded in West Berlin, and conveys the feelings that living in West Berlin evoked in Bowie. Ideal soundtrack then for Christiane F, being set in West Berlin."
1,Waste of money.,"I can't put my finger on it, but this book was a failure with my kids. It didn't inspire them to brush their teeth, and they weren't particularly interested in it. Not much work went into writing it. I would spend my money on something else. I wish I had because it's in the trash now. Especially don't get it if you have a young child because it will get ripped and broken VERY easily."
5,Excellent Headphones,"By far the best choice for in-ear headphones for live performance, these make anything sound fantastic."
1,Vintage clips but quality is disappointing!,Vintage clips but video quality is disappointing on an HDTV!Vintage clips but video quality is disappointing on an HDTV!Vintage clips but video quality is disappointing on an HDTV!Vintage clips but video quality is disappointing on an HDTV!Charles
3,Grab the brass ring (book),"This is a good general review, lavishly illustrated, of the history of the American carousel, biographical details of the most well-known carousel animal sculptors and manufacturers and the numbers of carousels as of the publication date 1990. The author is associated with the National Carousel Association, which naturally promotes."
1,Can I give this book zero stars?,"This book sucked, pure and simple. I thought it might be good, but I couldn't get into the weird style of writing. A few parts made me laugh, like when the ""My Secret Agent Man"" she wished for actually turned up, and was named My Secret Agent Man. The rest of the book was hard to follow and pointless, but I do have to give the author credit for dealing with stuff like homosexuality, broken families, etc. If you like quirky teen books, then go for it, but I personally hated this book."
2,"Guess I'm not ""sophisticated"" enough","The reviewers can rave about Block's magical prose all they like, but I just didn't like the book. Maybe I'm just too long past my teens, but I found no warmth in the relationships here. It all seems to be trying too hard. Providing fiction for different readers shouldn't mean we have to pander."
5,BEST BOOK EVER,"This is truly the best book ever, all of the characters are amazing, and their passion for life is infectious. Very meaningful, and sad, and happy all at the same time. If you haven't read this, you should."
3,Wonderful Weetzie,"I think I want to marry her. Ok, so really I just want to go out for coffee and share our writing. I want to incorporate some of her magic into my writings. I love it.I posted about reading Necklace of Kisses a while back. Well, when I finished that, I checked out some more Block books from the public library. First, I read Weetzie Bat. I wasn't quite as impressed with it. The beginning felt too quick. No story development. But, gradually, that improved, and I found myself loving Weetzie. I do not, however, see this as a young adult novel. It is very adult. As all of Block's books have been, so far. I love them, and they may be written on the reading level of a teenager, but they are not what I would call teen material. A little too heavy on sex and drugs, etc..."
1,Disappointed,The singer(s)does not do justice for the lyrics. It was grating to the ears. Save your money for the originals.
5,Excellent Anaerobic Bike Workout,"This is now one my favorite anaerobic Spinverals workout, followed by 34.0, 29.0 and 33.0. Using the Spinervals for indoor training has made a huge improvement in my biking ability. I definitely get a better anaerobic workout riding inside on a trainer than riding outside. The Spinervals series have been awesome, I got a free video from Coach Troy at a Sports Expo and now I have bought 7 others to mix up between anaerobic and aerobic days (especially during mid-west winter months)."
3,Not the complete version.,My 9 year old daughter asked it for Santa. She said is not the full version. I watched a few chapters and it was true.
3,Boring,Possibly one of the most boring books on the planet akin to watching pain dry or grass grow. Painful painful read
4,Good enough!,"I needed it for a class of mine in college. I am satisfied with it due to its low, low price. A bit messy here and there but no worries."
5,Great Discipleship Tool,"On January 1, many members of our congregation began reading through the Daily Walk Bible. This has literally kept us ""on the same page"" as we use this great discipleship tool. The translation (New Living Testament)is easily read and the notes and overview at the beginning of each day bring greater insight to the scriptures."
1,the worst yoga video ever !,"Yoga for Life, is without a doubt one of the worst yoga videos I have every had the displeasure of watching. Actually I couldn't watch the entire video, only about 30 minutes of it, because it was just too painful. As a matter of fact, I am throwing my copy in the trash right now! Don't waste your money. I have attended yoga classes for over 5 years, and for the past year attend 2 classes each week. I've never seen yoga this bad before. Thankyou."
1,No thank you,I was drawn to this book by the references to the Cornish coast and Daphne duMaurier as I have always loved her books. But thanks to a free sample and Nora's 1* review I was saved from what would have been a painful read (plus I saved $9.79 for a better book).
4,Fascinating story,"I got this book while it was a free promotional Kindle book. The reviews looked pretty good, so I took a chance on yet another unfamiliar author.I found the story to be quite captivating. I like historical fiction, and this book gives it an interesting twist. It is neither completely modern, nor completely historical. The concept of how the family history is accessed is intriguing, and on an intuitive level, seems plausible.Things I liked are: The author doesn't go into elaborate descriptive prose, yet there is enough description to create a picture in your mind's eye. The protagonists gain insight and grow; the antagonists are not so despicable that you come away hating them, but you wouldn't want them for close associates, either. In other words, even the ""villains"" are balanced and human. In my view, the exception is Collis Trevelyan, whose ambitions set the entire tragedy in motion.A very enjoyable read."
1,Do not waste your time/money,"Does not work as SF, Fantasy or Romance. All of which she tried to do but missed the mark widely."
1,Cottage by the Sea,"This had the potential for a good, gripping bodice-ripping beach read, but failed the mark miserably. One gets the impression that the (American) author wrote this with a book entitled ""English Witticisms"", or ""How Nannies Used to Speak Proper English"" glued to her side. Awful, mawkish characters, appalling dialogue and gobs full of miss-the-mark attempts at depicting the English upper classes make it a painful read. She constantly references the wonderful Daphne du Maurier - you'd do much better reading one of hers instead."
3,So so book,"This book wasn't all bad...it was a pretty good ""summer"" read. I rate what I read by how eagerly I read it and how quickly I finish...took me almost a week to read this one. Wasn't bad enough to quit reading, nor good enough to be ""can't put it down."" Characters were stereotypical, but time travel was interesting."
5,An enjoyable read!,"I just finished reading ""A Cottage by the Sea"" on my Kindle. This was a very enjoyable read that kept my interest from beginning to end. I'm anxious to read other books by Ciji Ware."
1,Ink Comes Off!!!,"We bought these for our 11 month old twins that LOVE music. However, after a few days, we noticed both of them were covered in black ink and could not figure out where it was coming from. We then discovered that it was the ink on their egg shakers! Who knows what is in the ink and they have been eating it for a couple of days now. :-( Very disappointed..."
3,These aren't baby rattles.,"I don't understand the other reviews here. ""My kids scraped the ink off and ate it,"" ""My baby got bored with these.""These aren't baby rattles. They're percussion instruments. They're good percussion instruments that kids can play with, sure. But I'm in a band and was looking for shakers to use at shows. I also teach music to elementary-school aged children, and they're great for some interactive group lessons for young kids.But they're not a toy for infants and toddlers. Nor do they claim to be.I typically use a nicer shaker for recording, but these are easy to throw into a bag, brightly colored so you won't have to dig around for them, and they sound fine.One of the other reviews complained that they're ""sharp"" sounding and slow, but it just depends on how you hold them."
5,A big hit with my 15 month old,My son LOVES these things!! He was shaking them and running around with them most of today - very cute and a lot of fun.
2,Ghost?,"I really like H.R.F.Keating, and can hardly believe he wrote this book. I couldn't even finish it. ""Doctor Smellyfeet""? ""Mr. Man""? Was that supposed to be funny? The ""Stop the Rot"" campaign? This one had to be to see if we were paying attention. Ugh!"
4,Fear of adulthood?,"Well, this book certainly has the right ingredients to make readers pay attention: adultery, murder, fear, suspense, mystery, families, youth and a clever balancing of a sophisticated ironical approach to tales of (true) crime and fear with all the suspense and thrill of the genre. Kate Byrne is a young school teacher playing at having an affair with one of her student's father. Wonderful depiction of her mixed emotions both as the other woman and as a woman still very close to childhood, and the suspense is masterfully built up and twisted throughout the novel. I'm looking forward to her next book already!"
1,Excruciating,"God, this book was dreadful, or maybe I just don't get this type of writing? Another reviewer has mentioned Margaret Atwood, but I have to say trying to get through her Blind Assassins was like pulling teeth, and I found the same with this book. By the end I was really hoping Kate would get killed just so she would SHUT UP!"
1,digital display failures,"this is the second sharp microwave i've had and with both, the digital display failed after brief episodes without power. unfortunately, the failed part costs as much as a new microwave. the first microwave we threw out. the second is still under warranty and will be fixed. sharp's authorized service center advised me that this 'happens a lot with sharps' and told me that they currently had seven more in the shop for the same problem. in fact, the part is on back order and i'm waiting for it before my oven can be serviced! sharp denies a problem! i find it hard to believe that they are unaware of huge orders for this 'board' that controls the digital display. my advise is to stay away from sharp microwaves until sharp fixes this obvious problem."
4,Good Microwave,Works good so far. Seems kind of expensive for the quality but is the only option I could find for the very specific opening that we had in our cabinets.
5,Great CD-ROM! Just like the computer test,I searched a great deal to find a nice review guide and this is definitely worth it. It times you and the computer tests (there are 3 tests in it) are just like the DAT I took. It helped me a lot. -Mark
5,Excellent Prep for the DAT,"I bought this CD about a month before taking the DAT. I didnt actully use it until a week before the test. The tests are harder here but worth taking for practice. Reviewing what you got wrong is key! I saw several exact duplicates of some O-Chem questions on the real test. Don't be discouraged if you score low on the practice tests. I consistently scored in the mid-teens on the practice tests, but scored a 25 overall on the real exam. The graphics for the PAT were poor this year on the actual DAT. There isn't much you can do about that. I also recommend taking a Kaplan course. They have so many resources that no one ever gets through them all. It is expensive, but it is worth it to get the score you want. Plus if you score high enough on the test, they will hire you to teach the DAT prep course, and they pay very, very well."
1,it sucks,IT SUCKS not worth the money not nearly enough practice tests i regret buying this i would not get this agian
3,science questions too easy,took my DAT this past week and this did not improve my score. The General Science questions in the tests were much easier than the actual DAT. Perhaps the questions were old. Reading Comp was good
4,A bit bland for a carnivore,"I just ordered the 12 pack of Amy's Minestrone Soup untasted, and I have to admit that I found it a bit bland for my taste. I love Amy's refried beans and chili, but I found this soup to be a bit tasteless. I had to add pepper and shaved parmigiano cheese to jazz it up a bit. That said, I'm a happy carnivore so my expectations for a vegetarian, organic soup was perhaps a bit too high. It was fine for everyday, but not particularly interesting soup."
3,Works fine.. charges a bit too fast?,"The battery seems to be working fine. It charged in about 90 mins instead of the normal 150 it used to take the original battery on my Dimage A2. Tho, it hasn't given me any problems yet.. so I guess it's all good.. I'm a lil skeptical about its full charge capabilities since it charged up so fast.. but seriously.. i doubt that going to be a big problem even if it is less than the specified 1500maH..all in one, cheap and effective purchase if it lasts :)"
5,Le Nozze de Figaro,"This is a superb recording made in the 70s. Herman Frey is fabulous as are the others, but he is phenomenal. I also plan to order his ""Barber of Seville,"" which I saw on PBS in the 70s."
2,This production shows a misunderstanding of opera,"Until I saw this production of Le Nozze di Figaro, I was a fan of Ponnelle. However the separation of acting and singing in this production is totally at odds with my understanding of the art form of opera. I cannot believe that any of the great cast felt comfortable with this arrangement. Imagine a movie of a well-beloved symphony where the musicians without their instruments expressed in their gestures and postures the mood of the music that was playing somewhere in the background - comical!!!"
2,Dreams Interpreted,I think this is more for someone who is actually studying psychology and dreams as method of treatment. The book is very complex and too deep for the average person who is just looking for dream interpretations. I downloaded it on my Kindle and fell asleep just trying to find the dream interpretations. Would not recommend for someone who is not studying this as a course.
2,glad it was a freebie,"this book is outdated and stupid. freud used dream interpretation in a meaninful way. they are a window into the subconscious.they can help when seeing a therapist.dreams are not funny,they should not be made light of."
4,Size is fantastic!,This item was purchased for our office and it looks great - we have had many many comments on it. It is lighter weight than I expected but that has been a plus also. Would like it even better if the hands were not so flimsy. Am worried someone will walk past it and catch on them and break them. Otherwise we do like it.
2,Basic and Boring,"The information in this book is accurate and presented clearly, but the techniques and recipes are extremely basic and boring. I won't need to refer to it for reference and thus won't be keeping my copy. Incidentally, no guidelines or plans are given for anything like the stone stove shown in the cover photo. Since that's such an attractive set-up, I think it's misleading to not include info on it in the book."
3,"doesn't have GREEN tea in it, only Jasmine","I thought this was Jasmine Green Tea because what a whacko I am, I actually believed what the title said. What I got was Jasmine Tea. No Green Tea in it. In the ingredients list it states Jasmine Tea as the only ingredient. Am I missing something here, or is the tea?"
5,Spectacular photos of Mount Everest and descriptions of the first ascent attempts and all significant climbs since,"Originally published in 1997, this book was republished in 2007, with 36 pages added with updates for the climbs from 1995 to 2006, including even more spectacular photos.This is an excellent coffee-table type book with spectacular photos and some good information. The book contains a detailed history of the discovery of the mountain by Sir George Everest, the attempts to climb Everest over the years from Mallory to Hillary, and the significant climbs since then."
5,Great DVD - camera angles very helpful,"This is a very good DVD for beginners - camera angles view as you the beader would be looking at the beading. Good close up shots. Some very good design ideas (at least for someone like me who doesn't get many ""brilliant"" ideas on my own."
3,OVERRATED!!!!!,"So my wife goes on and on about Elfen Lied so i get all hyped up to see it. Wow how bored was I? I had to force myself to finish volume 2. The extra hands are sooooo gay. The concept of the movie was bland. I did like some of the characters though; they were cute, like the lil doggie and the homeless girl.And Kuato is Gay, have you guys not noticed LOL"
5,Best Anime Created Ever,"The first thing I suggest is that you buy this movie. Be patient with the first episode. There is a lot of blood and nudity. However, the story line is excellent. This is the equivalent of a book that is a page turner. There are some gaping holes in the beggining that will be cleared up. There is another volume as well that is to be released. The opening song, is gorgeous. The movie is beautiful, Every person that I know that has watched it, has loved it male or female."
5,For anime lovers that like a lil bit of everything.,"Elfen Lied is truly an interesting series. It has the nudity, dark humor, violence, and creativity we all crave from a good show. At times there were moments where I wanted to slap a character, but overall the storyline was awesome."
2,Cute but glib--and wrong!,"This is an error-ridden, foolish little book that is just fine for casual consumption but is a terrible place for anyone serious about history to try to learn anything. I write Victorian-set novels, and I really think that books like these are a major problem with my genre as they fool would-be writers into believing that they actually have actually done ""research.""*sighs*Read through George Eliot, Trollope, Austen, Dickens, the Eyres, and Thackeray. Then read articles from popular newspapers and real histories of the period. And then collect fashion plate images and discriptions. Buy copies of Mrs. Beeton and Mayhew. THEN you will have done some research about the 19th c."
3,Good reference book for the 'Pride and Prejudice' ilk,"If you like reading books set in late 18th or any part of 19th Century England (Trollope, Austen, Dickens, etc.), this book is a very good reference. Indeed, almost half of it is a glossary. I'm not sure all the literary citations are accurate, but that is not the point. If you find yourself in the middle of a thickish plot and it seems important to know why a barrister is referring to the Lincolns Inn or whether a Bishop outranks a Duke or whether a guinea is worth more than a crown or what a beadle is and why he would rat someone out, this book will do the trick."
3,"Interesting, but uncited information (sometimes wrong!)","An interesting book, but the author doesn't tell us where any of the information comes from. I don't know how many inaccuracies crept in, but I was more than startled when he explained that a mangle - the hand-cranked squeezer that was used for removing excess water before hanging up your hand-washed laundry - was in fact used after IRONING to make your clothing super flat. I don't think so....."
3,"Fine, but too encyclopedic to be a cohesive read","I really enjoy older British literature, and I thought this book would be a good way to get a handle on cultural things I might be less familiar with. It was definitely detailed, but the writing was stiff, and it was too dry to read for any length of time. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
5,BEST OF ALL !! YOU WON'T REGRET.,I don't know why some others didn't like this series. I watched them a lot on WWII topic. And this is the one give you a quick picture to what was happened before and during the war till 1943. It's great for people who are not deeply familiar with the topic. It has an excellent graphics presentation. It is easy to understand the sequence in the war. It becomes my favorite movie of all.
3,overall good film,"this film series was made during the war, so #1 it's fairly factual, but #2 it's politically incorrect....basically this film was made to boost national morale, so it's your typical ""US is pure good and Germany/Japan is evil incarnate"". overall I'd definitely recommend this film, a must for any WWII fan."
4,"Not a work of fiction, but still good","Dos Passos is always good, so Brazil on the Move is good, too. If you're looking for a detailed nonfiction book on Brazil, this one is great. And if you're not particularly interested in Brazil, you'll at least feel a confident knowledge on the subject. It's hard to find this title, though, so if you get your hands on it by any chance, you should definitely appreciate the opportunity to read it."
5,Dictionary of Symbols (Norton Paperback),This book gave me the exact information I was looking for. I incorporate symbology in my paintings and this book gives just the amount of information and design to accomplish my aims.
4,Historical Analysis and Overview,"The authors do a very nice job of investigating and compiling records from military and civilian sources and then provide an entertaining account of Submarine Espionage from it's infancy at the close of WWII, through the cold war, to present. It is understandably vague when dealing with current information as not much has been declassified or otherwise made available. The authors could have been a little more careful pointing out the timeline. I found it very interesting to note the shifts toward an increase in politician involvement in military decision making. Which also seemed to be increasingly self serving. Decisions, policies, procedures etc have increasingly shifted toward use of the military for 'political capital' on both the national and international fields. If you like military history and strategy, READ this one."
5,Interesting piece of the puzzle in the history of cold war,"We may never know to what extend everything in the book is correct, maybe sometimes a bit of imagination was added to the reality, but in any case the book provides extremely interesting point of view on recent history. The book correctly mentions bravery and challenges of rank and file seamen, who sometimes had limited idea about wider implications of their actions, despite taking enormous risks for their country."
2,"Much ado about nothing, or at least about very little.","Perhaps I am jaded by 26 years as an intelligence professional but this book seems to be one good magazine article's worth of material stretched into a book. The author's describe several items of some passing value but mainly what they do is rehash a litany of information readily available in open source material. This is simply one of those books that promises much and delivers very little. I would suggest that the interested reader can find out more by using a good search engine and investing an hour or so at the computer. I must report, having been on the inside, that if the complete story could be told, it would be much more interesting and provacative."
3,A good read.,I just finished this book and found it to be good but not excellent. The research seems to be pretty good. There's enough live action and just a little of the political behind-the-scenes stuff. If you're into this kind of thing you'll probably enjoy it. If you're very critical then you might not.
5,Outstanding reading,"This book has all kinds of interesting accounts of american missions in the 1950's to the 1990's. Clearly written, a must have for any military buff."
2,"Emphasis is on ""blind""","Beyond the iteration of a series of very interesting and important events in the Cold War, the authors fail to capture the flavor of personal stories in those events, with some exceptions. In the first 150 pages there are no less than ten examples of the lack of comprehension of the way submariners speak and behave at their duties. Some of the quotes are simply not the way submarine sailors speak, especially those attributed the Navy chiefs.From a submariner, 1957-77"
2,Pretty Good Sea Stories - Too Much Journalist Gibberish,"This book starts out with some pretty good sea stories with only small hits of the ""Monday Morning Quarterbacking"" that journalists are famous for. The last half of the book was like swimming with concrete overshoes.Journalists love to interject themselves and opinions into the events of the past as if the writer really has some value besides the telling of a story. People who actually made history and had to actually make decisions are routinely second guessed (usually after they died and are unable to defend themselves). The opinions by the authors are often insulting and self-serving. The dropping of the holy grail ""Woodward"" is unnecessary and obviously ticket-punching by the authors."
2,Informational but not emotional,"Lots of drama here that usually doesn't break through the author's writing...when it does, it's a great ride, but much of the time I feel like I'm reading countless newspaper articles. The hour-long PBS special on submarines does the trick."
2,A Tour Album,"This was very dissapointing. I expected a reality based novel, but it turned out to be a highly expanded tour book of sorts for the USN Submariners. A forced attempt at dropping as many names as possible so that they may take their due place on stage. Obvious bait for Hollywood.Lacks depth or any serious literary skill. Feels like one long newspaper interview. Especially lacking was mention of the moral aspects of having one's finger on the trigger of a doom's day machine. Hard to believe this never occupied any of the thoughts of the men and women manning these marvels of technology and dispensers of indiscriminant destruction. So little mention was actually made of the real hero that enabled these brave men to navigate with such ease in the endless oceans of our planet: 20th Century science and engineering."
5,Excellent overview of Cold War submarine operations,"This book is well-written and authoritative. Information about Cold War submarine incidents was ""compartmentalized"" -- only those immediately involved in a particular situation were allowed to know what happened. As a result, it's unlikely many former submariners are in a position to verify more than about 10% of the book from their own experience. Most of us weren't told what went on with the other boats. That's true in my case.Having said all that, what I did already know of in this book from my own Navy tour is accurately depicted in this book and the other stuff seems very credible."
5,A great view into the life down-under!,"In October 1996 I had the privilege to spend a day on the USS Tucson - SSN 770, one of America's newest attack subs. We sailed out of San Diego 40 miles and dove to 200 feet where we practiced simulated torpedo launches followed by some ""angles & dangles"". We spent nine hours getting a feel of what this crew did - the pride and commitment obvious. Were these authors along too? Yah, a torpedo rack is one place to lay out a mattress, but it also makes great place to stow a barbecue grill made from a 55-gallon drum! (I was told for use topside as one floats through the Panama Canal). And yes, there were three flavors of bug juice. Blind Man's Bluff was a great read - I finished it in two or three sittings. It certainly reinforced and expanded my brief view of what these guys do. We finished the trip by closing down the Horse and Cow, but after reading this book I think I should have bought another round!"
3,Fine book - but disappointing,"I have had this book on my Wish list for quite a long time. So, when I finally went on vacation, I took this as my number one book. As soon as we hit the beach I tore into it. And what did I find? A book that never actually went beyond stories I had already heard.I am a little surprised that the authors did ""extensive"" research as I have seen / heard most of these same stories many times before on PBS TV, Discovery Channel, History Channel, etc.The interviews were by far the best part.In short, if you have not heard a lot of submarine stories before, then you will love this book. If you are a junkie of the espionage / spy genre on TV (real TV folks, not made up stuff) then skip this book.I give this book 3 stars only because I was hoping for more."
5,Run silent run deep,I enjoyed this book because my son was in the Navy and one of the boats mentioned in the book my son served on. I have it in hard cover.
3,Only the tip of the iceberg...,"From an ex-bubblehead, it is quite apparent that Sontag and the Drew's did their homework. The book is well researched, unfortunately, they were apparently captivated by and spent all together too much time dwelling on the ""special projects"" boats.There was not enough effort expended in understanding the very special culture of the submarine force on both sides of the cold war. But then, I suppose this would be a book unto itself, and certainly not as 'sexy' as Blind Man's Bluff.Spending time in the submarine force leaves an absolutely indelible mark on the psyche. Even 20 years removed from the force, I still dream frequently about the time spent there."
2,A book with three authors but no editor,"After reading the book itself, it was gratifying to read comments by actual submariners and find that the writing really WAS on target. Not having any experience with subs I had to depend on my knowledge of peripheral details to decide whether I could rely on all the information I couldn't verify.For example, I found the reference to ""180 degrees north longitude"" pretty disturbing. And someone who states that 13 feet of water has the same ""molecular weight"" as a foot of lead...well, I know what they're driving at, but it left me wondering how much of what I couldn't verify was worth believing. And so forth.Other commenters have mentioned the somewhat unfocused, here-and-there nature of the writing. I still want to read about and more deeply appreciate what submariners have done on my behalf, but from other authors."
3,"Very good, but....","AE 6 is a revolution from 5.5, and I've only had it two days. This book is very well written and presented, and the examples and the project it has you create give a really good overview of the program.BUT... Sadly, it barely touches on any of the amazing new capabilities of the program and is therefore pretty much redundant for experienced users. Far more useful and informative are the help files within the program itself - tutorials and examples of the new functions. I'd recommend this for new users only."
3,too many gaps,"I found this book extremely frustrating to follow.The structure is fine in that you 'build' a project continuously but I had problems with the files on the cd and ended up having to figure out a lot of things by myself. For example, why isn't the very first file that you import the length of the composition? It's VERY frustrating to be following instructions precisely and to have the very first exercise not function because of a technical error, that, as far as I can tell, is largely because an important first step in building a comp has been ommited from the book.Ultimately, I am moving on from this book because I feel I'm wasting so much time trying to 'fill in the gaps' by myself."
3,so-so intro,"This book is so-so intro to After Effects. I liked the fact that all chapters are centered around a single project. However, the book won't teach you much more than what you can learn by looking at the help files or a manual or the free tutorials on Adobe's website. Creating Motion Graphics from Chris & Trish Meyer is head and shoulders above this book."
2,Not good,"Seems this book ""Classroom in a book"" have very strange structure.Every part of book depends from other and if you didn't made previous (just couldn't or found not enough information to do it) - you can't normally make the rest of exercises.That is also not very nice in this book - that very much the same information how to open file, for example. And it's a bit irritating.And such useless information takes a good part of a book. Sometimes not enough screenshots to show important moments, but there are other screenshots, that are unimportant.This book is ok. Would give it 2,5 stars if it would be possible."
3,An oldie but a goodie,"Written reletively soon after the period of focus. His views are somewhat myopic, yet his narrative style makes reading easy and fun. Good if you want the facts in story form. A classic."
2,Software old fashioned,"The people who had send me this gave great service, but to comment on the product; the pictures and box looks pretty, but the software is very old fashioned. I would not recommend."
3,It was OK.,Better than their last album. More produced with more solid themes. I would definatly pick this album up for nothing else but the track 'Worlds Apart'.
3,A step back,"Source Tags & Codes was so bombastic and it showcased the sound that sets TOD apart from other bands. I know good bands move forward and I suppose TOD has. This new CD doesn't come close to Source Tags & Codes, but it isn't a bad CD. Some of the edge is gone; this CD is too ""clean."" I heard some of these songs done live in Dallas, and they sounded better in the raw. TOD rocks, make no mistake. Just don't expect too much from this one and you'll be satisfied."
2,"Really, really mediocre","This isn't a horrible album. In fact, it's probably better than 95 percent of new albums released. What is dissappointing is how bad it is for a Trail of Dead album. You can pick of any of their other recording, anyone of them, and you'll have a much better sound. This one is overproduced and underwhelming. Before it was like they couldn't contain their energy and outrage. Now it's like they have to muster it up from a youth and talent long forgotten.There are a couple of good songs. But the album as a whole kinda sucks. It's like someone took Trail of Dead songs and then handed them over to Quincy Jones, Brian Eno and Phil Spector for re-working. The result is confusing and unfocused. Like it could have been something great, but some huge accident happened in the recording studio day after day."
1,These guys are terrible,"I guess anyone else who's heard of these guys love them, according to previous reviews. I have to listen to this cr*!@p at work.The singing is terrible, lyrics retarded, and don't even think about musicianship. It's all very blah, these guys play like they don't even care about the music they're playing."
5,Best so far?,"It might be slightly better than So Divided (but not much difference). Lots of strong, powerful rhythm. Anthems mix with melodies. Emotion stays strong. This band needs a lot more recognition! I know they've moved around, but I still like to think of them as a NW band."
1,Don't Do It!,"I had an earlier model (R1500). It literally fell apart. The control panel went and had to be replaced, then the door started to crack, now the control panel is not working again, and the start button fell off. Piece of junk!"
5,"great, love it.","bought these for my brother. i'm always hesitant about buying shoes online, but turns out i had no problem with em. got exactly what i expected. love em :))"
4,A Fun Action-Comedy !,"I rated this a ""4"" because my criteriain judging a movie are adjusted to itsgenre; and as an action-comedy I felt itapproached a Harrison Ford type comedy,which I rate as ""5""Acting was realistic, photography great,and we even got a bit of sermonizing(how a fighter's discipline works againsthis ability to be confidential about hisfeelings).Deborah Maria Moore was a nice bit offrosting on the cake.If you're not jaded as a movie critic,and like light comedy and air force actionsee this one!"
5,another excellent cd by the pumpkins,this is an excellent cd full of old songs corgan and gang wrote i admit that its not as good as MCIS and SD but its one of the greatest cds ever put together
3,Not bad....,"This CD is by no means perfect--arguably their weakest--but it contains a few brilliant gems. If you want a Smashing collection of B-sides, get The Aeoroplane Flies High...Pisces pales by comparison. I'm getting this disc because it's Pumpkins and has some excellent songs that make it worthwhile. :)"
3,"Good for a ""B-Sides"" album","This is a strange album. When I first bought it, I was blown away by songs like ""Frail & Bedazzled"", ""Plume"", ""Pissant"", and ""Hello Kitty Kat"". Oddly enough, I got sick of this album really fast. I don't know why. Looking back on this album...it was good...but B-Sides are B-Sides none the less. Overall it's good for a B-Sides album and I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you like Siamese Dream, a lot of these songs sound like the ones on that album because many were B-Sides of the singles from that album. If you really want the best Smashing Pumpkins album, get Siamese Dream."
3,Sharp Microwave R-530EW,"The Sharp microwave is a fine product. It is easy to use, attractive in appearance, easy to clean, and usually well made. My particular experience is not typical. I had the misfortune to get one with a loose plate over the magnetron tube, and it buzzes when turned on. Contact with the company was competent, and required me to take it to a nearby city to have it looked at. I will do so when I can find someone to help me. Meantime, I have learned that the buzzing is not harmful, just irksome. I have used Sharp microwaves before and always found them excellent."
2,cheap cheap and cheap.,"The toy gun shoots suction cup darts.. that is if you figure out the you have to not pull the trigger back... but instead make it go down...if that sounds dumb, you ought to see this piece of junk.. most of the items in the kit are down right terrible."
4,BALLAD OF THE ROUND BALL deserves serious listening.,I agree with the folk above. This is a great modern album -- it's almost 1986 retro computer music. Very very swish. (I do think his ltd. ed. STORY OF THE HEAVENS album is his peak though). Can't wait to hear some new stuff from this fella. Where can he go now?
3,A really twisted sequel to The Sentinel.,"More or less picking up where The Sentinel ended, The Guardian: Sentinel 2 has a married couple move into the still haunted apartment complex built upon the rubble of the demolished brownstone from the previous story. While knowing who the sentinel is and what she is there for robs the story of the first's rich vein of suspense and mood, author Jeffrey Konvitz compensates by throwing some stunning curve balls in the story's latter half. While nowhere near as compelling, not to mention frightening and seemingly confusing, as the first novel was, The Guardian nonetheless offers an entertaingly twisted story that almost satisfies. Almost because the book reads like the middle part of a trilogy that never materialized, oh well it's still worth hunting down."
3,Not bad,"For an hour long documentary this is not bad, it is not great either. The actor portraying Lewis - Anton Rogers is very good. The story is not great. The facts are there, but they have been cut and pasted to fit into the time frame and the goal of the writer/director/producer, etc. Small facts that are not quite true are given, which may lead one to believe things about Lewis which were not true. However, this is TV and only an hour. It is worth a watch, rent it, check your library, do not buy unless you are getting a great deal. Two very good documentaries are The Life of C.S. Lewis by Day of Discovery - www.dod.org and C.S. Lewis: The Dreamer of Narnia - comes with The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe extended edition DVD."
4,Good movie,"I surprisingly liked the movie, I thought it might be dry but it was done really well. A little over the top with demonizing corporations but still a good movie. I may even change some of my eating habits now."
2,so.......,"How else do you feed 310 million Americans without charging $50 for a 5 lb bag of potato's? Cattle naturally were grass eaters yes but why assume corn does not serve man's modern needs. Man was created to walk or run do we give up driving, flying, riding bicycles etc..etc..I thought. Individually I might consider organic for better health but can appreciate our need for these process efficencies.I thought the scene with the field processing of organic small farm chickens especially funny. Imagine how much chicken would cost our 310 million citizens if thats how all our chickens were raised and processed. Sad to say I think we really have no choice, Food, Inc is here to stay. Did I mention 1.3 BILLION Chineese?"
5,Must See TV,"I, like many people, have been leaning toward preferring organic and natural. I'm not sure if my principles were weak or what, but I found my dedication toward this way of eating fading over time; I often thought, ""well, what's the point, almost everything in our environment is toxic anyway...there's no point in even trying to eat healthy."" However, this film revitalized my interest. It was refreshingly disturbing at times, in terms of the treatment of animals and the food corporation's treatment of farmers and workers. I only wish there was a booster dose available every so often, just in case I lose my determination to do better for my own body and our society as a whole."
5,A real eye opening movie,"Everyone should see the movie to get educated about how the food industry has turned from farming and harvest,to factory corp. A must see."
4,Good but too preachy and a bit too glib,"A better documentary is The Future of Food.Still, I applaud the existence of this documentary, to capture those audiences that will never read the book versions."
5,Eye opening,Makes you think. Backs up some wild claims. Another reason illegal immigration will never go away as long as corporations need cheap labor.
5,Must Watch !!,This Should Be Mandatory Viewing In school. Stop putting celebrities on pedestals and pay attention. They are poisoning us for population control. Eat locally and know where your seeds are coming from.
5,Great movie and Amazon is awesome,Amazon gets stuff to you so quick when you order it from their warehouse. Great movie! It will change the way you think of what you eat forever.
5,Only buy if you are interested in better health,"This movie is eye opening and revealing to anyone who wants to know from where their food comes. I do. Many do not. Most of my family does not. I understand. But like Oprah says, ""When you know better, you do better."" This is why many do not want to know. But that attitude is what is killing us and our children. Although, you may not want to know for your own person, what about our kids? What are you teaching your own child? Nothing is as important as what we put in our bodies for nourishment. So, what is your excuse now?"
4,"FOOD, inc.","I only wish more people would get this message and start watching their diets. Very informative. We really need to watch what we are feeding our children. We are a very loud voice to the commercial food industry when we refuse to BUY foods that are not good for us.I don't have a problem eating meat, however, there should also be a respect for their giving life to us and there should be value placed on the way and the amount of foods we take from animals. A big part of turning this thing around and not abusing our power is properly educating our children and living as a example."
4,A great reflection,"A great look into the corruption of the food industry. I wish it was more in depth, but a good documentary none the less."
3,good movie. BUT...,"great movie, watched it a couple times before and i decided to buy it for my own home. problem- i bought this delighted thinking it had subtitles in Spanish as it says above in the description. nope. nothing. NADA. please correct the description. now im stuck with a movie my family finds boring because they dont understand, when i would have liked them to view and take in the important aspects the movie brings to the table."
5,disturbing,"Food, Inc is a good movie for anyone interested in the food industry. It is a little disturbing. It does open up your eyes."
5,"Food, Inc.","""Open up your eyes and ears and ye are influenced"" and oh man are they! America, we are capable of finding a better way to treat the animals that sustain us. This is the ONE CD that belongs on all library shelves to teach our children how NOT to proceed in the world of animal husbandry and agriculture."
5,Amazingly Informative!,This was an amazing movie. I absolutely love it and I have made changes to my diet and what I buy at the grocery stores. I hope everyone gets to watch it some time soon because the future is now and our bodies are important to us.
1,Not fond of the Amazon video experience,"I would much rather watch my videos on whatever media I have invested my money in to purchase instead of being locked down to my desktop. This is the only movie purchase I will ever make through Amazon's video system. I own a Mac and was not allowed the priviledge of actually downloading the video to my iPad. ""Food"" was ok. It would have been awesome on my own terms, but on Amazon's terms it was merely ok."
5,A must see!,I think everyone should watch this film. It is well done and super informative. You'll never see the industry the same way and hopefully we all make changes after watching it.
5,Should be required viewing for everyone,"This movie is a must-see for all Americans who care about their health and their country, which should be all of us. Eye-opening info on big Agribusiness and their practices."
5,Eye opening,"This was so eye opening that I shared it with my entire staff.My thoughts after viewing this are buy local,regional, and seasonal.This is a must view for all especially those working with familieswith health concerns such as childhood obesity and diabetes.What mayseem to be healthy choices may be harming us."
5,This is a good video that introduces the unfairness in the food industry from grain to meat.,"It's sad to see that people who are trying to keep the integrity of food are being bought/sued/driven out of their purpose by large businesses that have no interest in selling low processed, healthy food. The food industry is a business, but they should make consumer health a priority."
1,"Food, Inc",I grew up on a livestock farm and spent my career in the food industry. There are needed changes we can all agree to - eg. we need to eat fewer calories and eat more fruits and vegetables. Let's work on those and other areas of agreement rather than trashing a whole industry.
5,Completely changed the way I eat.,This documentary really opened my eyes to the disgusting things that happen in the food industry. I am very careful about where I buy my food and what foods I buy. I think EVERY single American should watch this documentary.
5,You must see Food Inc.,"Food Inc. is a great documentary about agribusiness in America. The film traces the negative effects of the way these companies do business from your plate all the way back to the factory farms and petri dishes. Authors Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser are among the people shedding light on the corporate controlled American food industry. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is important to see how your food gets to your table."
3,An unrealistic waste of time.,"This novel is about a group of gifted children attending the Academy. The Academy is actually a mansion transformed into a school; it's connected to the nearby university. The psychology students at the university study these gifted children without them knowing it. Josh, who is exceptionally gifted, is suspicious when people start disappearing. He gets very worried when he finds his good friend, Amy's, body wash up on shore of the pacific coast. What is going on? John Saul is a gifted (no pun intended) writer, and although the characters are life like, the plot is not. The plot if not realistic, but it is very logical. I found this book to not be very worthwhile. I would not recommend this book for anyone 15 and younger because of the greusomeness and the fact that it's dealing with children's bodies being mutilated."
1,Hand Me the Aspirin,"Picture is adequate and some features are slightly better than that, but the television makes buzzing noises of varying pitches and volumes even with the sound all the way down. It seems that certain colors in the picture (I'm guessing white) cause the noises. When watching TNT with the rotating promo graphics over the bottom and right of the screen it sounds like a construction crew at work. Get it together Samsung."
1,NOT the Bag in the Picture,"I ordered these from B&M; Housewares without understanding the fine print. Despite the picture of the Eureka bag, this is a Eureka SL ""Style"" bag that is made by another company called Enviro Care Technologies. Is it the same as the Eureka bags I have been using? The bag is made of a different material. The cardboard top that attaches to the hose has a peel off tape while the Eureka don't have any tape. Better? Worse? I'm not sure. Deceptive? Definitely. Why not put a picture of the bags they are selling which are not even called ""Eureka SL Style"" bags-- the package calls them ""Electrolux* Sanitaire* Style SL"" and lists some model numbers.I went online to save time and get the same bags I've been using. They should put a picture of the bags they are selling."
4,Rising above...,"Marumari has never been one to dismiss in the super saturated world of IDM. Taking more inspiration from classic video game score composers than from ""last weeks favorite"" electronica release, The Wolves Hollow is an incredible statement filled with sweeping obscure melody soundscapes and soothing beats that compliment rather than dominate. The album flows in an unpredictable but elegant manner, kissing the foreheads of dub, ambient, hip-hop and trance. Although the sci-fi wolf fable suggested in the liner notes and track titles seems more an afterthought that a compositional theme... It does introduce a light sense of playfulness which reminds me that Marumari is much more humble than one would expect from an artist with his talent. If The Wolves Hollow lacks in perfection, it merely does so in promise of what's to come from Marumari down the road. I'll be waiting anxiously."
5,Beautiful and practical,"I love watches and have bought many over the years, but this is by far my favorite. It has all the features that I wanted -- an attractive, unique face; wearable for both work and casual; second sweep hand; inconspicuous calendar window; and a secure clasp.I have a larger-than-standard wrist (about 7-3/4 in.) and this fits perfectly. Smaller wrists may need to remove a link or two."
4,"Natural Health Bible for Dogs & Cats : Your A-Z Guide to Over 200 Conditions, Herbs, Vitamins, and Supplements","This book is very informative. I coud hardly put it down. The author describe the herbs and their uses, but, howver, the author does not give the dosage of herbs for animals base on their weight."
4,Time for a replacement,This is the third identical convected microwave same modle oven I have purchased because it was worn out. I use it for every meal plus snacks and they last me about 8 years. I check other convected microwaves each time its worn out and always go back to the same one as there is nothing any better out there.
2,not a good product..,"After a two week wait for site to store, I went to pick it up. Got it home and plugged it in. Wanting a cup of tea, put a cup of water in. Three minutes later, cold water."
4,Sharp microwave convection oven,"This is the third one of these units that I have had through the years. I love it. It does virtually everything that I need to do with a traditional oven, only it is easier. In fact, if I redo my kitchen, I will have two of these units and no traditional oven. Great for baking, turkeys, sauces, the list goes on and on (including defrosting tv dinners and reheating stuff).My only wish for this oven is that they would offer the temperature probe that was available on my older model. Great for jams, jellies, sauces. They come out perfect every time!"
1,Will not ever buy another SHARP micro-convection,"bought on 12/2/2005on 10/10/09 inside light stoped and then turntable wouldnt run. machine would no longer run. took it in and was told the door switch was out. that cost 92.00 to fix.1/20/2011 same problem with door switch. cost another 92.00 to fix. only got 15 months since the last repair.2/27/2011 same problem with door switch, never have found what is causing the problem. the service center contacted sharp tech but said they were no help and they would try talking with the engineering dept. it is now 4/6/2011 and i havent heard anything back from themi would not recomend buying this product to anyone. i did talk with sharp myself and they were not friendly at all and acted like it was my problem not theirs.the first sharp micro conv i bought lasted over 25 years, i guess they had more pride in their products back then. now i guess they want to sell and dont care.hope this report will be helpful to you, buy another brand."
1,Planned obsolescence,"First, the turntable stopped working. Next, it would not come up to the proper temperature setting. When I used a higher setting, it would shut off completely. Lastly, the metal turntable was slightly off center and barely impacted the oven inner glass. It caused a micro fracture in the glass. I was watching it and the micro fracture began to ignite. The glass shattered. This product has too many problems in store for the buyer."
5,It's a keeper,"It is made by SHARP, there is nothing more to say. There products are the best money can buy."
5,Excellent convection Microwave!!,"We bought the same model 10 years ago, and used it daily (multiple times). The older one still works fine for microwave and basic convection. but it would shut off when trying to Preheat for broiling. We still use it as a backup microwave/convection. Bought this one, identical to the first. If we get another 10 years out of this one, it will be as good as the first one we bought!"
5,"Still made, but cheaper material","We felt fortunate to be able to find this to replace our old unit that had given us great service for years. :) Not surprisingly, the newer item is built cheaper than our old model. The door catch and the open latch are really cheap feeling plastic. However the internal workings are still great. The vendor for this, out of New Jersey were great to work with. Thanks Amazon."
4,Sharp R-930CS,Nice and roomy. Great selection of auto-cook functions. Clock numerals too fine and small for reading from a distance.
4,"Sharp R-930AW 1-1/2-Cubic-Foot 900-Watt Convection Microwave, White (","This is a very good product. One of the best features is the 150 degree setting for keeping food warm. The only thing I would add is a 200 degree setting. I had three other Shape Microwave Convection ovens one lasted 7 years, one lasted 10 years, and the last one only lasted 5 years."
3,Seems to be working sort of,"My wife wanted these. I personally don't think she needed anything as she really doesn't have appreciable lines or wrinkles, but as with most folks, the problem looks more severe to her than it does to me (or anyone else I think). Anyway, she's been using it for a few weeks now and she reports that she thinks it is helping some. Not a lot, but some. So there you have it."
4,I like this,This pad is great and really smoothes out the chest skin. I sometimes find it uncomfortable to sleep in because I am a restless sidesleeper. I wish these were made for the face like a mask because I really think they smooth and plump fine lines. You can wear it for a few hours before going out and you will still see results although not permanent without regular wear.
3,mediocre product,"I tried this and it did seem to work, however, the pad no longer sticks to me and it has only been 2 weeks since I started using it. I would highly recommend this if it either came with replacement pads or if it did stay adhesive longer. I'm currently looking for a replacement."
3,STAR WARS BUILD YOUR OWN LIGHTSABER,"MY SON AND I HAVE GREATLY ENJOYED THIS TOY. YOU CAN BUILD HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT LIGHSABERS NO 1 IS THE SAME YOU CAN HAVE A JEDI SABER OR A SITH THE CHOICE IS YOURS TO MAKE YOU CAN EVEN MAKE A DOUBLE BLADED SABER LIKE DARTH MAUL YOU HAVE 3 CRYSTALS TO CHOOSE FROM RED, GREEN, AND BLUE THESE MAKE UP THE SABER SOUNDS YO ALSO HAVE 3 DIFFERENT COLORS TO MAKE THE BLADE RED, GREEN, OR BLUE SO MY SON AND I HAVE HAD ALOT OF FUN WITH IT."
4,A socio-religious narrative of a medieval S. France town,"Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie's book, Montaillou is an informative look at a medieval village in Southern France. Its writing style is similar to Bibbey in its ability to place the reader inside a historical period and see it from the perspective of the people involved. It is an objective, though intimate look at the hypocrisy of clergy and the excesses to which they were involved. Stake-burning and the debauching of virgins were an ever-present threat, as well as cuckholded husbands terrified to reveal the priests responsible. A smooth, flowing narrative, it is a must-read for anyone interested in medieval European society, and captures the attention of the reader from start to finish."
2,Introduction to Social Work & Social Welfare: Critical Thinking Perspectives,"I received the item in the required limit, however, within one week of this course the binding and completely fallen apart. Sadly it seems you get what you pay for. Wasn't a very good deal after all."
3,"Fair, but not moving","I loved Julie Roberts debut CD. I still listen to it on a monthly basis & I've had it for quite some time. However, the new CD is average entertainment. There are a few really good songs but I find myself bored in between. I find it hard to keep my concentration during the whole CD."
3,Great Voice! Not so great songs.,"First off, Julie has one of the best new voices in country music. I could listen to her sing just about anything, but the songs on this CD are very boring, and kind of depressing. I don't think it is as good as her first album, but she has such a good voice, that I would recommend this album. I just wish she would have picked songs that were a little more uplifting."
2,1 song 2 stars,The Peace Maker(the song) is the only reason why I give this 2 stars dont get this pleaseP.S. I like Tony Touch but not this.
4,"A Must Read, but Read this First","This book is a great prelude to the Narnia series, since it was written after the original series. It is about a girl and her friend who stumble upon an opening to a new world (its way more complex than this). The reason I only LIKED this book was because, like with most beginning stories, the introduction is boring. The intro on this one seems to be a little longer. I thought the book was very interesting once it got to the point.If 'The Hobbit' by J.R.R. Tolkein was unexistant, than this prelude would have gotten 5 stars. But, since it is in existance, then it gets its 4 stars for 'liked it' but not 'fantastic'. If you like fantasy, then 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' is the superior line. But don't take me wrong, the Chronicals of Narnia are Fantastic. (and of course Harry Potter) :)"
3,Wonder what it sounds like?,"Gosh, ALL these Brokeback CD's sound interesting. If there were some samples I could listen to I might actually buy one..."
4,good reading for science fiction fans of all ages.,"i have enjoyed these books several times, several years apart. good reading that i enjoyed."
3,FLAKEY,"Library Journal says this is ""Gellhorn's anthology of articles"" I don't think so. None read like articles written during their particular time period. None read like articles any organization would pay money for.All read like shes writing them from memory after the fact. Some, way after the fact.Her writing is such... so lacking in substance that you feel she is making it up. It doesn't feel genuine.I've also read 'Travels with Myself and Another' and wasn't impressed."
