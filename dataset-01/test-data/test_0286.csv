2,Ambition To Meaning ReMarketed as The Shift!,"I ordered this film (Ambition To Meaning) from Hay House. I liked it so much I ordered another copy for my friend. My problem with ""The Shift"" is that it is the same exact film repackaged as a ""new film"". I too got an email from Hay House promoting this new Wayne Dyer film. When I logged onto the Hay House site and took a look at ""The Shift"" I realized that it wasn't new. I was disappointed with Hay House for sending me an email presenting this film as new and also because I had already purchased two copies of the original from them. This review is not to stop anyone from purchasing ""The Shift"". It is very good. I don't have any idea who was responsible for the name change and repackaging but I think it was a dumb decision because it ""reeks of corporate greed""! And it reflects badly on everyone who was involved."
2,Just Okay,"The Shift isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one. I watched it as soon as it arrived from Amazon, but I haven't had any desire to watch it again. He's a little easier to understand in this movie, unlike his seminars which I find incomprehensible at times and more like infomercials for his other books. I feel as though he has so much wisdom to impart, yet he can't seem to get it out of him. It's like he's speaking in math, or riddles, and I often wish he'd just cut to the chase and help people for once, instead of touching the tip of the iceberg while hawking his other books."
5,The Shift Movie,Sit back and enjoy this incredibly uplifting and inspirational movie. The Shift puts life in perspective for those looking for the deeper meaning of life which generally comes in the mid-life season. I caught bits and pieces of it on the OWN network on Super Soul Sunday and couldnt wait until I could sit back and relax with it in my own home. The Shift is time and money well spent.I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.
3,CArol - An Opinion,"I expected some lyrics, so to that extent I was disappointed. However the music is relaxing and I enjoy listening to it. If you know the Carols, it would be quite suitable as accompaniment for a singalong."
5,From Casual to Discerning Listener -- It Satisfies!,"Sit back, close your eyes, and lose yourself in this richly textured production by Gian Tornatore and his talented ensemble. It is a pleasure throughout. The variety of mood and style ranges from the opening sinuous line that slides through brooding harmonies, to the bowed bass performance of the classical Chopin Prelude in C minor, to the final cut, a playful and creative arrangement of the Miles Davis standard Nardis. The bass player, drummer, and keyboardist maintain an exquisitely balanced musical conversation over which Gian Tornatore's lyrical sax swoops, hops, sings, and swings. The improvisations of all the performers display sophistication, intelligence, and style. Complex and masterful rhythmic transitions lie in wait to surprise and delight you. This is a CD that will satisfy the most discerning jazz aficionado as well as the more casual listener. I look forward to hearing more from these young artists!"
4,"Pretty Good Interpretations, OVERALL","1) Behind the Sun : Pretty good, but they made it a little harder 2)Savior: One of only two Californication covers, its pretty good. Like the real one. 3)POE Power of Equality is good, but the cover sucks, as they turn it into a metal song with an awful singer4)Sexy Mexican Maid Cool version5)Under The Bridge Sweet jazzy cover its sweet the rest are okay or worse, except 8)Scar Tissue its a great jazz/orchestra type song its sweet you gotta hear itMe and My Friends is CRAP"
5,Carsontastic,"Hereeee's a word or two about a great product and wonderful service from the seller. I didn't see Johnny's show when it aired, so everything is new and wonderful to me. Recommended"
3,Could Be Disappointing,"Since this has not yet been released it is hard to say whether it will be good or not. However, one hopes the producers have learned from the very disappointing ""Heeere's Johnny - The Definitive DVD Collection"", which I purchased last year and found myself unsatisfied with afterward. The format of that collection failed to entertain me; I filed it away and don't care to watch it ever again. It was mostly clips, and seemed not to flow well at all. Plus there was a lot of material that just wasn't all that great.I know there has been a challenge finding some of the episodes from way back when, so hopefully this time some other material is included, not the same stuff that Carson Entertainment has been recycling for years."
2,Can't even spare a full show opening?,"I love Johnny Carson. I can understand truncating the shows, and I can live with the horrible fade-outs in mid interview, but, couldn't they at least give us the complete show open? Would it have killed them? We have to have a horrible fade in as Ed is saying 'and now, here's Johnny?'i find the editing and fade ins and outs to be very amateurish."
2,Disappointed,"Bought this for my husb who is (was) a huge tonight show fan .. we both were very disappointed in this box set .. whoever put it together chose boring episodes, and apparently the worst of guests .. the only episode so far that we saw that we liked was with rodney dangerfield..Sorry, Carson fans, which we are as well, but this to me was a complete waste of $90."
4,Great Little Book,"My 4 1/2 yr old daughter was due for an x-ray and ultrasound appointment at the hospital for a routine protocol procedure to rule out a pathology ... and as it was her first appointment for any kind of scan / x-ray, I wanted to explain the procedure, how it works, that she had to lie still and what it looked like afterwards. This book provides copies of real x-rays and has a simple story line which makes it easy to understand & reassuring to children ... and takes away the anxiety of ""the unkown"". I found it a very useful little book and she was amazed at the black & white x-rays depciting real life cases."
4,Didn't work for me,"After doing some research I had my wife buy this for me for Christmas. I followed the directions, but unfortunately this compass didn't work for my car (2001 Toyota Camry). I've always wanted a compass for my car, but my last 2 cars didn't allow any compass to work. No matter where I put the compass in my car it always registers southeast. When I get out of the car the compass immediately points in the right direction. So I guess it's just the combination of the metals in my car that don't allow compasses to work. That's nothing wrong with the compass (hence the 4 star rating I gave), it's just having cars that don't like compasses."
1,Unit doesn't work,"What a disappointment. After working for about 30 seconds, this unit has never again worked. I purchased it through an Amazon seller, and received some technical advice that didn't make any difference. I'm hopeful I can return it and get my money back. (Even the tech support said it's not easy to set this up.)"
3,"Not great, but not that bad","The book is not as bad as the previous reviewer states. True, Jack Davis deserves a much larger book. Reproduction on the color items as wash balck and white is not good, but the repro for the black and white art is very good. And the paper quality and binding are good. It's not what it could have been but not a disaster either."
3,Simple discussion of obeying parents,"A friend loaned this book to us. My 3-year-old likes it, and it has made some difference in his attitude and actions, so I decided to buy it."
3,"Fun, but falls apart","I agree with the other reviews...my 3 year old son loves this toy, but it constantly falls apart and gets frustrating!! the design could have been better being 3 stories tall and the weight of the dinosaurs head makes it difficult to play with. All in all, my son still loves it...especially the cool sound effects!"
5,"Jimmy and Anthony's Review ( 5yr, 3yr )",Trex mountain is good. It is great and I like it so much and I just founda rubber band. ha ha ha - really. I waga wewa wo.
4,Not bad for what it is,"I am not trying to be negative or write a negative review, but my 4 & 5 year old son has very little interest in this nor any of the imaginex systems. I am not sure if they just simply leave too much for the imagination or if he is just the odd one!!! I would recommend that you first evaluate your child and be sure that they really like imaginary play before purchasing a lot in this line. Maybe, like my son, they would rather be playing with sports or live animals or other large motor skills things. Children are all so different!"
1,T Rex Mountain - waste of money,"I bought this for my then 3 year old son and it was recently thrown away because it would not stay together. It was difficult to put together initially, and did not stay together for him to even play with. It ended up in a drawer and he played with the dinosaurs separately. My recommendation would be to stay away from it. It is definitely not worth it."
4,A Great Addition to the Imaginext Lineup!,"We have been a fan of Imaginext for about 2 years since we purchased some of the now discontinued city sets for our son. He started his Imaginext ""collection"" at age 7 and at age 9 still enjoys building and reconfiguring the sets. I recently purchased the T Rex mountain since he is a science and dinosaur fan. He loves it! He combined it with his Rockslide Ridge and Coast Guard set to make a ""Jurassic Theme Park."" This toy really sparks some good creative play. I do not agree with the age range on the box--it may be a bit difficult for a 4 year old to put together without help-but for the 6 to 9 age group, it provides a great opportunity for constructive, creative play. The set is colorful and has some neat ""special effects."""
4,My son's 4th birthday present,"My son just received this toy for his fourth birthday and loves it. I was a little apprehensive to buy it with all of the negative feedback I read about it falling apart. However, every time he saw it he made sure I knew that this was what he wanted. I am so happy we bought this for him. It does not fall apart nearly as easy as I thought and read that it would. The little pieces do come off quite easily however my son can put them back on himself. It does not bother him at all. Overall I think this toy is great and would be good for any little boy that loves dinosaurs."
2,Most frustrating toy my son has owned!,"My son is obsessed with the Imaginext dinosaurs and has almost everyone in the collection. The T-Rex mountain was a gift for his 3 year old birthday and PERHAPS it's just oo old for him. But I'm way older than the age range and I can't stand this item. Like previous reviewers say, it's made SO poorly. I couldn't even figure out how to put it together. My husband had to. Then, once it's together, it falls apart at the drop of a hat. And you can imagine what happens when a young boy actually plays ""dinosaur"" on it. So, once it's apart, I can't even figure out how to put it back together again. I'm almost to the point of throwing it away because all it does is clutter up our play room. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.My one positive remark is that my son does like how the ""skeleton"" swallows up the little men and they're trapped in the cage."
3,Not very sturdy,"I have to agree with other reviews, lots of little pieces and the three levels don't stay together very well. You would think the pegs would lock together a little better than they do. My son loves dinosaurs and this toy. Just wish it was a little more stable. I'm kind of surprised FisherPrice hasn't figures out a better way to assemble this."
5,The Venus Fix - Book 3,"The Venus Fix is book 3 in M.J. Rose's trilogy. Having read the first two in this series, book 3 did not disappoint. Early on in the book I thought I had figured out who the killer was. As the book progressed there were several prospects. Without giving away any spoilers I will just say I loved the twist and certainly didn't see it coming. Just like Ms. Rose's other two books this can also be read as a standalone. Even though the author provides enough history about her characters and how they have come to be where they currently are I would still recommend reading the first two books prior to The Venus Fix.Series orderThe Halo Effect (MIRA)The Delilah Complex (MIRA)The Venus Fix: A Dr. Morgan Snow Novel (Butterfield Institute, Book 3)"
1,RGSDSEDGS,a book that is very very good if you have very small mind.great support for manbear who will make cartman the nextVP.
3,SPARTACUS,One of the best movies of all times. I bought HD DVD Player and not Bluray because of Spartacus. I was not satisfied with the picture quality. I expected a movie theater like experience. It was not. The sound quality was also poor.
3,pretty good classic...,"This is a great movie which even today stands the test against time. While it isn't quite up to par with Gladiator, it does hold its own as a classic tale of the rebellious slave gladiator who stands against the Roman Empire. I recomend this movie to most, but watch this first before you watch Gladiator. You will see art only gets better with time."
1,Boring,Boring ... but Spartacus: Blood and Sand - Gods of the Arena - Vengence from Starz/Encore Five Stars *****This video of Spartacus isn't worth your time or money.
4,kubriks only true story film,"the story is about a slave revolt in ancient times.i wonder if the people spartacus represented get free stuff in that country still like the slaves families here do.probably not.americas the only country stupid enough to care about such nonsense.its a little violent for kids but this is 1960s violence so its not so bad.stanley kubrik directs so you know its a great one.those interested in history or just good old fighting will enjoy this one the most.it is,like i said ,true.the chicks are all dirty and poor.the main character is a slave after all.another great film by stanley kubrik!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Spartacus,"This rousing epic was disowned by Kubrick after a contentious, difficult production, but ""Spartacus"" still offers grand-scale entertainment, thanks to bold, sure-handed direction and a powerhouse cast. The brawny, clench-jawed Douglas shines in his signature role, while Olivier is suitably poisonous as the cold-blooded Crassus. Other notables include the rotund Peter Ustinov providing comic relief as a cowardly slave-trader, and Charles Laughton, who lends gravitas as a senior Roman senator. If you're craving generous portions of spectacle and sweep, here's your movie."
2,Truly for the beginner,"If you ARE NOT serious about playing the Soprano sax, or your child wants to learn how to play, this will be perfect for them. Otherwise, the intermediate or professional player should STAY AWAY. This horn's tone quality is horrible. Maybe I should have tried a different mouthpiece. Maybe I would have gotten a better tone out of this. I can't even use this as a back up. it really does sound rather bad in my opinion. But... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!"
3,"Basic, beginners text","This book is a good place to start learning about digital electronics and microprocessors. I was a little disappointed with it, in that the text wasn't as ""deep"" as I would have liked. I'd say this would be a great text for a high school based introductory course on microprocessors and digital electronics."
5,The BEST Strategy Game,This is a great strategy game. Make governments to raise commerce or military strength. I can play this game for hours every day. It is very hard to beat. Games are usually 1:30 long. I strongly reccomend this game.
4,A Great Missionary/Doctor Story,"This is a great little story of a missionary who was arrested as the Communists took over China. When he was arrested the Communist could not find one local person to testify anything against Wallace's character. When you read this book, you will see why."
5,Highly Recommend!,"This is an EXCELLENT book no matter whether you're a resident, fellow, or attending. The outline format makes it easier to locate the high-yield facts you're searching for. I especially like the first chapter in which they go over molecular diagnostics (we can always brush up on that), the GI chapter, Gyne chapter, and the Derm chapter. The second edition is even better with numerous color pictures. I am currently a resident and this book is on my roster of texts to entirely read before the boards. Highly recommend!"
4,Differential Diagnosis in Surgical Pathology,"Very good book, concise and clear, with great colour pictures and very actual. Although I miss the the first edition's diagnostic algorithms."
2,"Poor Audio, No Call Transfer","These phones look great. But one had poor audio, with callers saying I sounded like I was in a cave. The other sounded OK, but had a lag between when you pushed the answer button and when you could actually talk. Also, you can't tell someone to pick up the extension if the call is for them. Only one phone can be on at one time. The three selectable ring tones are all poor. I returned these phones."
1,Nice Color but Utterly Silly,"If overall score was based on the cinematography or transfer of the movie to DVD this would rate high. But the story is utterly silly. Silly too is the acting (it is clear only one actor here speaks English). It is sad when actors need money so badly that they will do something like this. If you buy this it won't be long before you put it on an internet auction advertised as ""viewed once."""
4,Great service,This was a good movie was in great shape. I came in the time promised with no problems. Thank you
2,"highly regarded director, hope this isn't his best","a major dissappointment, boring, vapid, turgid, etc etc... planet is all mist and people keep dissappearing in and out of it, but unfortunately this isn't 'atmospheric' as the other reviews say, just as gripping as watching paint dry.And as for that ending... silly is not the word.many people admire this director, that was the biggest dissappointment for me, i hope that the next mario bava film i see is a damn sight better than this one... reptilicus is still worst of this batch of midnight movies though."
4,Surprisingly great,"Such atmosphere, such texture, great costumes, fluid camerawork, and a fog-machine that's stuck on setting #9.... it all adds-up to one great curio.As a fan of Bava's other films, I was apprehensive about this one, but now realize how class (and very influential) it is.The picture is sharp,the colours are vivid, the sound is very good---- Recommended."
1,"If you freeze it, it will crack = not worth it!","I love the space saving aspect of these. But, after they've been used in the freezer, they crack very easily. I wouldn't recommend them and wish I hadn't bought them."
4,Difficult Material Masterfully Done,"It is interesting how the few people in this world that understand the human condition show their empathy. It is delightful when such persons write books, such as MD Cummings. The Whipped Pups of Bitterbrush is a wonderful story of love, family, growth and justice. Dealing with abuse can be hard, and anyone who reads this book will realize it even more deeply. It also shows a particularly disgusting business to be even more repulsive. One thing I was impressed with was how the author dealth with harsh and difficult material while still keeping the book clean for almost all ages."
5,Excellent Writing of a Difficult Topic,"Abuse is a difficult topic to be handled in the literary world. M.D. Cummings has supplied readers with an intriguing, interesting and triumphant story with his book Whipped Pups of Bitterbrush. It crosses the gap from children's literature into adult literature that is missed by many authors. The characters of Whipped Pups of Bitterbrush give all hope who have ever been or are in the terrible grasp of abuse. This well written book also gives the reader a much needed chance to smile, even though the topic is real and dramatic. I recommend this book very highly. I especially appreciate the theme, because it is what I had to do with my life, and that is, Abuse Stops With Me."
3,"Beautiful scenery, horrible acting, predictable.","Normally I don't go against the curve so much on reviews of movies, but I just watched this and man..it's so long, so predictable and boring. The acting is less than good with the main character trying so hard to act in-love and act like she's 20...but it just fell flat for me. The squealing and giggling never rang true, the love story was sooooo predictable. I just can't see why anyone would love the story itself. Not to mention, she's a cheat, a liar...he's leaving his daughter alone with his mom even though he's away enough (as a reporter) already.Aside from that, it's totally worth seeing if you want to see Italy. That is what got me to watch it and kept me watching. If you want to enjoy the camera work and the scenery, it's worth a look. If you don't mind predictable storylines and lame acting, go for it :)"
1,I wouldn't bother watching for free...,"Where do I start? This was bad on so many levels. First off, the storywas, well, boring. I don't mean because it lacked action - of course it was alove story which we always enjoy more than any action flick, but this one was just blah. The characters were not likable. We (my wife and I) couldn't empathize with them at all. The acting was mediocre and stiff. The cinematography was amateurish withlots of harsh back lighting, even during intimate moments that youwould expect to be soft and gentle. The story was entirely and oh sopredictable with, again, amateurish aspects that rendered it entirelyunrealistic, and worst of all was the sound track. The dialog wasdifficult to hear and understand to begin with but they overlaid aCONSTANT musical score that was too loud and mostly out of place and rendered the dialog even more difficult to hear.I definitely don't recommend it."
1,Poor description,"It was unclear that this was women's. All of the other women's sizes say women's while none of the men's sizes say anything. This said nothing, so I assumed it was men's large, but it was women's large. Not helpful."
1,Warning: Could be a ticking bomb,"While I had this product it seems to work great, I used it on flights, road trips and about anytime I needed an extra couple hours of gaming. Then one night while I had it charging I woke up startled after hearing a loud pop. It turns out one of the batteries in this thing exploded, leaving a large black powder stain on my desk (it cleaned up pretty easily) and throwing small pieces of plastic all over my room (some of them went ~11 feet where they were stopped by my door!). I'm just glad nothing in my room was broken and the psp-charger wasn't damaged. I don't want to even imagine what might have happened had this thing exploded in my laptop bag, or even worse in my pocket! I've now just decided to stick with sony branded batteries and trying to make it to save points before doing a battery swap."
5,Forever Changed My Life,"I received this book as a gift years ago during an intense and exciting season of pursuing the depths of God. I loved the book and prayed the prayers of impartation in the book with a careful diligance. Little did I know, it lead to a similar experience as Gary's, which forever changed my life. I highly recommend this book as it is truly power packed for those who hunger and thirst to know God in the deepest way possible."
5,BRING THIS CREAMER BACK!!!! VERY VERY MISSED!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OMG! My sister Introduce Me To This Creamer While On Vacation. And Fell In Love With It. Now, Please Tell Me Why You Decide To Discontinue It. WHY WHY WHY WHY!!!!!!!!!!!! BRING IT BACK IT IS GREATLY GREATLY MISSED.......................... :("
1,not one of larry the cable guys better albums !,I had one of his other christmas albums considered it to be better!this one is just a lot of red neck filth !!!
3,Its Larry but not exactly what you would expect.,"I bought this CD and high high expectations, an they were quickly dashed. A comedy album without a crowd just isn't right. That and the content was to short. The CD case shows a total playtime of thirty-six minutes for twenty six bits. Many bits less than a minute long. Some of this was due to not having to wait for crowd reaction. Some of the bits were to short and still it seemed like the CD would never end.Did I hate it? No. Some bits were funny and some bits were just gross. In the end it is OK but Not Larry at his best.Language is strong and not for children."
1,Drunk guy goes into a recording studio,"Drunk guy goes into a recording studio was probably the working title for this CD. It's just terrible. Not terrible like funny, just terrible. Just listening to the previews for this CD lowered my opinion of LCG. Stick to the Blue Collar Comedy Tour or similar."
3,If you can ignore the racism and anti-semitism,"Written in 1919, ""Why Joan"" is a rather predictable and tame love story. If you can ignore the racism and anti-semitism that some characters display, it's not bad, especially for free.Joan Darcy is a motherless 19-year-old girl whose bon vivant father marries an entirely unsuitable woman for her money. Will Joan ignore her scruples and marry a man she doesn't love just to escape from her floozy of a stepmother?"
4,"Funny, funny script","I read this book, a stage play, because I'm going to be directing it this spring at my local Playhouse. Dr. David Mortimore is about to deliver the Ponsonby Lecture, a prestigious address that will almost certainly propel his career into the stratosphere. On the day of the lecture, however, a nurse he had a dalliance with 18 years ago shows up with a teenage son he never knew existed. David and his sidekick Hubert begin piling lie on top of lie to protect his career, and things spiral completely out of control. The script is funny as heck (which is why I wanted to direct it), and a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to working with the snappy dialogue and bits of physical comedy that Cooney provides us. And let's face it, any time you can throw in a little cross-dressing, it's going to generate plenty of laughs."
5,"""Man's life as commentary to abstruse / Unfinishd poem...""","I loved it. The poem, the prose, the structure, the story, the comedy, the irony - the book delivered it all.The ostensible subject of the book is a poem by a fictional poet John Shade with hilarious commentaries/footnotes by his supposed close friend Charles Kinbote.If you're not liking the set-up already, please stay away; it gets better.Kinbote hilariously and almost willingly misunderstands and misinterprets the poem to mean something entirely different and basically hi-jacks the literary commentary, goes off on tremendous tangents, and chronicles his own life in the footnotes thereby making John Shade's observation in his poem true:Man's life as commentary to abstruseUnfinished poem. Note for further use. (p. 67)Thus Pale Fire is about Charles Kinbote's life as commentary to an abstruse and unfinished poem by John Shade.Beautiful.No need to make fool of myself for adding more comments to an abstruse yet finished work."
2,Useful solely as a historical reference,"From what I had read concerning this book and other works of Hildegarde's, I had assumed that it would be useful for one interested in herbal medicine. Though I fondly smiled at remedies involving unicorn horn, and at cautions about avoiding the meat of the gryphon, I was very disappointed that there were no useful ideas, for all that I respect the skill of the medieval herbalists. Entries are merely Hildegard's description of a plant or animal and its humours."
3,Translation,"My husband and I are enjoying reading this book. Since Hildegard has been made a Doctor of the Catholic Church, we've been exploring her writings and music. Our complaint is that the translation of this book doesn't well reflect the deep faith of St. Hildegard: she believed in Jesus and much of what she wrote was the fruit of prayer and study. This book translates the parts speaking of her faith rather stumblingly. We look forward to a more informed translation of this and her other books."
5,Love it!! `,I am a single mom of a baby girl and need all the help I can get so having baby right next to me at night is perfect. I can use this for storage after she grows out of it. She is 3 months now and still has a while before she'll move up to a crib. The ONLY downfall is that it's a pain in the rear to lock the sides into place. I have to use all my strength and put it up against something to lock the sides into place.
4,Definately worth it but challenging to transition,"I only have a few warnings with the Mini Co-sleeper. It is much harder to fold up than one would hope. I have to flip it upside down to get the bottom bars to fold completely. It is also very hard for me to put the one side up and down, my husband and I have both struggled to do it. The last of my complaints are the sheets. I've found cradle size sheets are the closest. You can order the right ones from Arm's Reach if you want to pay 15 dollars each plus shipping.On a more positive note, the storage space at the bottom is a plus, baby can use it for longer than a small bassinett and nothing beats the convenience of having your baby close to your bed but not in your bed at first."
3,"Nice, but not needed...",This was a nice thing to have but definitely not neccessary. We bought it because we lived in a tiny apartment with one bedroom and figured the co-sleeper would last longer than a bassinet. We couldn't fit a crib in the bedroom once the baby got too big for the bassinet. The co-sleeper turned out to be nice because our son refused to sleep in the bassinet away from us! He would cry and cry until we put him in bed with us or in the co-sleeper. I agree with most of the other reviews. The co-sleeper is difficult to break down. We basically had to leave it where it was because everytime we tried to fold it up it would get stuck and take forever to fix.
4,Recommended,"Not the Rez Band. Not a collaboration with D. Mansfield - just older straight-ahead ""worship music"". Definitely recommended."
2,NOT FOR FLOORS!!!,"Bought this for my entry way tile, got it home, read the instructions on the back and learned that it's nor recommended for floors. To be honest, I wouldn't use it on my counter tops either. It leaves a residue."
4,Great CD Collection,These 3 CDs are a great addition to my music collection. I would recommend them to anyone who loves clasical music.
4,Great Narrative of Ancient Sites,"Secrets of Archaeology is an excellent video narrative of many ancient sites. A nice overview of the history is given while the sites are shown in good detail. However, I was hoping for something that would show and talk more about the actual excavations and findings at these sites. To me the little things, like beads, pots, tools, etc. that are unearthed are more telling and often more interesting than the general histories."
3,Red enamel pitcher,"The pitcher was exactly what I had wanted but it arrived with a chip in the rim. In all fairness, I did not complain to the seller to see if the situation could be rectified because I needed the pitcher before such a transaction could be sought. If there had been no imperfections I would have rated the transaction 5 stars."
5,"For once, they get it right","No live or alt versions of your favorite songs, no dance remixes; nothing but the best as greatest hits albums should be. Too many times, record companies or artists try to be creative and end up messing up the whole concept of greatest hits album. All 8 number 1 hits are on this CD with album favorites thrown in to make up the 13 tracks. Sure, Creed had several B-side and compilation songs that could have added up to 20 more minutes of music including some of the beautifully done acoustic tracks. Regardless, this may be the first hits CD that I am able to listen to all the way thru without getting bored or skipping a lot of undesired tracks.I say Bravo to Wind-up records. I believe this Wind-up's first attempt at a greatest hits and that's good to know for all of your Evanescence fans out there.. if they don't break up before releasing a few more CDs."
1,knock-offs,how lame can a band be? first they copy the same sound as one of the best grunge bands ever...and then they release a greatest hits compilation almost the exact tyme pearl jam released theirs...i totally agree w/ the other person on this...pearl jam released rvm and it is by far the best album released this year....once again pearl jam came out first like always..and who would buy a greatest hits cd of a band totally broken up?? they couldn't last half as long as pearl jam...i'm suprised they did this i'll admit....being that they don't have 1 single greatest hit.....
3,3 1/2 Stars,"Finally the Creed Craze is at the end, since I believe they were one of the most over-rated rock bands EVER, yet even with their cockiness, and some really bad ballads, there is some good rock music here. Creed wrote some good songs, but still over-rated in my book. This is somewhat the best of the bunch, and most of the tracks are pretty enjoyable, but junk like Arms Wide Open and other sissy ballads, really take away from the band, so I can only give it 3 1/2 stars, cause the some of the other tracks are that bad"
1,Worst Band Ever Times Infinity,Giving Creed a Greatest Hits album is like giving Adolf Hitler a Humanitarian award. This band is the antithesis of all that is great.
1,IS SCOTT STAPP ERASING MY REVIEWS!,"I think that I have written my third review of this horrible band so I hope that this one is a charm! It's possible that these guys might be the biggest reason for the downfall of good rock music period! EVERYTHING about this band from the music to their attitude wreaked of arogance. And they along with their label sold this turd to the american public, and to top it off people ate it up! Well since this band is no-more I will not waste my time or yours with anymore about this group of half-wits.............On to review Stapps solo record, wish me luck!"
1,Creed had hits????,Creed had hits? Did Scott Crap ever spit out that golf ball? The disc sure would make a nice coaster.
4,Great compilation,"This compilation rocks...from song 1 till' the last one. There's a few songs that I don't like, but it has more than 5 major hits that make it worth it."
4,Cycling USA west coast,Interesting guide book. The routes are well explained and detailed enough to not let you worry about getting lost. Well worth the money
2,Buried in logistics -- where's the war?,"If you are writing about the Falklands War, this would be an important source book for details on some aspects. But if you want to know about the war, pick another book. Michael Clapp was Commodore (permanent rank was Captain) of the amphibious assault force, the naval officer in overall command of getting the marines a soldiers ashore along with their supplies. His book, written with a colleague, is a numbing and intensive description of logistical matters liberally strewn with incomprehensible acronyms. Much muted complaining about bad communications and fuzzy organization. It's a wonder the Argentines lost! Events outside his immediate concern get little notice. Sinking of the Belgrano and its consequences merits a mere dismissal as left wing whining. There is no sense of humanity here at all. Still, one has to give credit for the enormous logistical task successfully completed at such a distance from home base. But it's easy to put down."
5,miracle metal,"I don't know what the folks at Calphalon make thir pans from, but this stuff is a modern miracle. The 5-quart sauce pan is as advertised: sears meat as well or better than a black iron pan I used to own, gets hot and stays hot at low energy settings, and cleans up like a dream. Wish everything I owned worked like this pan."
5,worked great - haven't had a problem,"I chose these because I was using them for CDs to sell. the cheap ones you buy at staples are not as dependable. I've been happy with these.when i print on the CD itself, it looks good."
4,Works Well.,"We have only used a small amount so far, in Our FOODSAVER V2840, for some broccoli that holds a lot of water and makes for a tough job to get to seal. The rolls worked as good if not better than the Foodsaver trademark rolls (0 failures on 6 bags). The only reason that I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is that I like to use a fair amount to give My honest opinion of the product. Check back later for an update. If they continue to work as well, I will be moving it up to 5 stars."
3,The French Army in Microcosm,"This academic study focuses on Rochambeau's expeditionary corps sent to America in 1778; the first half deals with the war in America and the second half with the impact of the French Revolution on the units when they returned to France. It is apparent that the corps was a hand-picked force by the standard of the day, and it performed well in America. Unfortunately, Scott does not spend much time detailing the French combat performance at Yorktown. Back in France, the units stuck together better than most during the Revolution, but eventually blended into the melting pot. No maps."
1,It's all hype,"I've seen the video for this song and nothing about the song, or video clicked with me. I must admit that the video doesn't help the song at all it just accentuates how superficial the production quality of it is and how cookie cutter and faceless the treatment of subject matter is given. In no sense is Fefe Dobson an original, or even interesting artist at this time. What's surprising is how popular she is(the video nearly made TRL). She's not even a passive triple threat like Britney and doesn't possess a distintive voice. Good luck in another profession."
5,Love it,"I love both of the songs. At first i didn't really like Bye-Bye Boyfriend, but after listening to it a few times i really started to like it. I can't wait for Fefe's Album to come out"
2,Joe arroyo la Voz Colombia,A love joe arroyo music but this cd to me is less then a was surprise this one the only track on this cd smokes is the tune La Voz that's about it for this cd
5,Hope this toy is still available when I have kids!,"I bought this toy for my niece for her first b-day five years ago. It remained one of her favorites for a long, long time. She is turning five in two months and she still talks about it. She did a ""big girl"" thing recently and bequeathed it to another sweet baby friend of the family. I think she still wishes she had it but she bravely says it is a baby toy and she is a ""big girl"".I have another niece who is turning 1 in a month and I have bought this toy for her. I know she will love it, too. As far as the less than 5 star ratings listed for this toy, the fact that it has no on/ off switch is really not that big a deal. It only sounds off when you're actively playing with it. It is a great toy and I can only hope I can still find it when my husband and I have our own babies.Don't let this deter to you. There is so much to do with this toy. Every animal makes a sounds, plays a song, something. Hours of fun!!"
4,trips for trips,Step by step how to set up a or any home office or business. Would be useful for any home business. Great ideas. Worth reading.
5,Best. Album. Ever.,"I love it. Go Montreal! Very, very catchy songs.Fav songs:All Men Fear Women...: The title is so true. So are the lyrics.Too Much Attitude: Great lyrics and trumpit.Holiday: ""Holiday... Away from you! Holiday... Away from you!""Surfin' in Tofino: Real, real catchy.Life of the Party: Awesome brass on this track.All the other songs.The CD rules, buy it now. Check out Planet Smasher's ""Mighty"" as well."
5,Finally a good source for poppy seeds,"My grandma made the best poppy seed buns when I was a kid, but in the USA I was forced to buy the poppy seeds in a tiny glass jar for $4.98 and they were always stale. Finally I found some for a reasonable price and good quality to boot. Thanks to Bob's Red Mill for making it possible again to share grandma's recipe with my kids."
4,Novak/Trijicon Glock sights,"Good price on the sights from Amazon. Nice sights. Not as bright as SIG sights, but good. Front sight a breeze to install. Did not come with any blue loctite so you will need to purchase some for the front screw. Rear sight took a lot of patience. Had to spend some time slowly filing the rear sight to get it to fit. Very tight. If you don't have a sight pusher and ability to fit a sight yourself, you will need to get a gunsmith to install it. This was on a new Glock 30SF."
5,Really great record,I really have to say that this is a record that any modern jazz record collector should run out and buy. Ronnie Cuber plays baritone sax and i really have to say that he plays wonderfully. I have not heard a bari sax player that I like this well since Pepper Adams in his heyday. Tom Harrell is really a joyful trumpet player. The rythm section is right on.I had never heard of De Graaf. He is a Belgian piano player and I will be looking for his records in the future. This is really one of the best contemporary jazz records that I have heard in a very long time.
5,"The best recording of ""Panama"" I've ever heard","I really love this album for its recording of ""Panama"" which is my favourite jazz recording ever. I listen to it several times a week. The track features several extended solos, all of which are magnificent but my absolute favourite is Ian Wheeler's clarinet solo - my favourite clarinet solo of all time. Every time I listen to it, the pulse and sheer inventiveness of the playing take my breath away. Enjoy!"
1,A slanted view on a marriage,"The author made several comments that were maddening to me. One was ""Firearms are commonplace in the USA"" when referring to William on a ranch for vacation. Firearms are not commonplace in the US. I don't own a gun, no one I know owns a gun.That is an unfair comment.The author also explains that with her affair, Diana didn't take seriously her marriage vows, yet in the paragraph above, Charles and Camilla have arranged to spend Sunday's together. Double standard? Or is it an author kissing up to the next monarch and going after someone who can't defend herself. The author writes that she had had discussions with Diana, I am sure where ever Diana is now, she regrets ever speaking with this woman.Don't waste your money as I did. I am done purchasing anything by this author."
4,It changed my life.,"Is good book for non-English reader desiring introduction to American culture. Mister Backman has encapsulated brilliantly dynamic of American culture. Havel found this book useful in bringing down the oppressive communist regime in my native country, Czech Republic."
1,Dead on arrival,This is a a second Skagen watch we are having problem with in the last 6 months. It appears Skagen is no longer using quality control for its products. Beware!
2,"Nice Watch, Weak Band","My wife bought me this watch 2 years ago. I have enjoyed the sleek fit and comfort, but have had nothing but problems with the band. I must admit, I am probably pretty hard on my watches, but I have had to replace the band 3 times now (at $25 a pop). What happens is if you kink the band in any way, the wires that make them up will start to fail leaving you with sharp edges that catch on your shirts, and anyone within arm shot of you. I have not been able to find another band that will fit this watch. Too bad because it really is a nice looking piece."
1,bad handle design - ripped open in 14 months,Bought this flute case 14 months ago. The way the handle is designed causes it to rip the cover. I won't buy another like this one.
4,College life simplified,"I love this, bought it for my Amy(flute's name) and she and the case fit perfectly and I've never felt safer about the case I had her in"
5,Great Movie -- For Adults and Kids,"This is a great movie, both for adults and kids. I bought this primarily for myself, since I love chess, but also for my wife. We have seen it many times and enjoy it time. If you thought chess was only for braniacs, this movie will show you otherwise. It is very much a sport. In fact, many very good athletes who also play chess will tell you that a chess tournament is physically more draining than many sport competitions. I would certainly agree.The tournament play is realistic as is the jaunts to chess clubs in Manhattan and Washington Square, which I visit as often as I can when we go to New York City. The stress, fun, elation, effort, exhaustion, sound and everything about the tournaments are great. The ""moral of the story"" is the greatest part, though (no, I won't mention it here).The sound is fantastic. The cinematography is accurate and great. The editing is very good. The transfer to DVD is very good.Definitely a movie to have available for guests."
5,Inspiring & Awesome,"Great movie, shows a different angle on how people learn differently. Not too long and not too short- just a very well made movie that really inspires one."
1,What's On It?????????,"After desperatley searching the net trying to find out exactally what was on the cd, I came across a review on Amazon.co.uk by John Hunter From London UK. Basically all the CD is, is a way to get cash out of fans pockets and into someoneelses hands that has nothing to do with the band Evanescence.If in doubt i recomend that you check out Johns review on www.amazon.co.uk. And all I can say is Thank you John, now I know not to make the same mistake you did."
1,ugly,This was the worst book i have ever read i am a little more stupid now after wasting my time with this worthless hack
5,The best of the worst!,"Not being a fan of underground comics at all, I was a little hesitant to even open this book. Within seconds though, I found someone else out there was equally as twisted and full of angst as myself - and funny as ever. This is a 'best-of' type collection of some fantastic and well-contrived comics with a strong and bitter dark sarcasm throughout. Touching on many modern American social issues, this guy Clowes hits the nail on the head every time with his twisted insight into the human condition. No household is complete without this work."
5,Excellent!,"I first heard this group on Christianrock.net, and the song was ""1*0*1"". I was a fan instantly. I finally bought this CD after several months... It's great! The music is great, the lyrics are wonderful, and the group is just great! 1*0*1 is still my favorite song on the CD, but ""Look What You've Done"" and ""Joy"" are both very good. If you like alternative Christian music, you'll love this CD. I can't wait til the next CD comes out (according to their website, it should be in the fall of 2003)."
4,flash backs,"Anybody remember The Police way back when? Very similar sound but with a positive message. Pay attention to 101 and What Have You Done, by far the best songs on the album. Enjoy!"
1,Not worth the dime!,"The TuneBox for iPod Shuffle is just not worth the time and the dime we paid for it. The sound is weak and terrible, I guess you get what you pay for. There are other speakers out there for the Shuffle, and even though they might cost a bit more, the sound quality is much better. Take a look at the Sonic Impact, about twice the cost as the TuneBox but, it will give you 5X the sound quality. Do not waste your time on this cheap piece of plastic; it is just not worth your time and disappointment."
2,"Dumb, dumb, dumb","I will watch anything in which my favorite actress, Drew Barrymore, appears. But this movie is for Drew fans only. The plot is hopelessly lame, telling of the nefarious influence of bad girl Drew on an improbably wealthy Beverly Hills family. There is almost no plot, little of value in the way of character development, and it is pretentious throughout. And unless you're watching the movie when you're about to drop off to sleep, you might find yourself laughing at quite a bit of it. However, the acting on the part of the two principals, Sylvie (Sara Gilbert) and Ivy (Drew), is good--and for that I'll give one star.The other star I give just for the inspired casting of Drew in the Ivy role. Her classical beauty contrasts nicely with the vixen she is recreating. And Drew is in nearly every scene--an added bonus. But why does she continue, even to the present day, to make movies unworthy of her basically serious and intelligent disposition?Bubba"
4,about this movie Poison Ivy.....,"Cooper, in the first place, should npot allowed Ivy into the house which in the end cause the death of her mother(Ivy pushed her down from balcony at the master bedroom). Ivy also have some [love] related scene with cooper's father during the story and Cooper killed Ivy by pushing her down at the same place, what Ivy had done to cooper's mother at the end of the story....."
4,Bad Girl,"I just watched ""Poison Ivy"" recently, and after all these years, it still stands the test of time as being a great film. Drew Barrymore gives an intense performance, I love her character in this, and I will go as far as saying this is my favourite performance by her (if not her best?). I love the haunting score with the whole saxophone thing playing whenever something naughty is about to take place. It gives ""Poison Ivy"" sort of a campy, ""red shoe diaries"" type of feel. The stroy is also interesting and gripping, and you really want to know what Ivy is going to do next. Drew Barrymore has come a long way, and ""Poison Ivy"" was the film that launced her mature career to a great start. Footnote: I saw Leo Di Caprio's name in the credits, but don't remember seeing him in the movie, strange....."
3,It's contagious,"Depressed girl's best friend starts moving in on her life, sleeping with her father, and killing her mother. Not much on plot or substance, but the cast takes whatever they can work with and makes an unforgettable dramatic thriller that disappoints only the simple people. Fans of Leonardo Di Caprio will not be pleased with his bit part in the film."
5,Ingenious,"This is a delightful book and it is ingenious. A person can adventure through a variety of realities, all elicited by the story. It's as thought-provoking and inspiring as it is heartwarming (it makes me cry). Each time I read The Golden Frog, my experience is expanded, I have new insights, and I understand things more deeply.The concepts for personal growth offered in this book are subtle, but more powerful than any therapy I've run across. And, I've been a counselor for over 20 years. A fun book, and one that invites reflection, The Golden Frog receives my highest recommendation."
4,Old-timey patriotism,"Several US states are the subjects of RED, WHITE & BLUEGRASS; two other songs celebrate the flag, and a third, an entire region. This collection is jam-packed with high-energy pickin' and foot stompin' good times.All of the tracks on RED, WHITE & BLUEGRASS feature finely talented musicians-- its really good traveling music. I'm most partial to the faster-paced tunes here, especially ""Alabama Jubilee,"" ""Peach Pickin' Time In Georgia"" and ""Pennsylvania Polka."" A thoroughly enjoyable album.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 41:02"
2,To big,This visor clip was listed to be bought with the Cobra ESD7400 radar detector but it doesn't fit that detector.
1,Not a usefull item. can damage your visor too,"I bought this to use with my Escort 9500ix . Using this will mask many of top function keys. Also it can scratch the visor & lining of the car above the visor. Furthermore it blocked the GPS function of the detector, making its use worthless. I threw it away."
1,Doesn't work at all,If there was another angle on the metal to mount it facing out of the vehicle it would work well but it just isnt practical
1,Not using it!,When you insert the clip into the RD. Then try to install or hook onto your visor. I crushess the buttons and it makes the screen of the RD not visible. Good try but not useful. Sorry!
2,for intellectual helots only,"If your idea of a good documentary is having some fairly good-looking chick (for academic standards--let's be real)with a british accent self-consciouly jump around a few ruins wearing colorful blouses and tight jeans, well then, you've found what you're looking for. Otherwise stay away. Apart from a short scene that dealt with Cinadon's conspiracy in 398 BC, there was virtually nothing of interest here. It's pablum."
3,What else would you expect?,"Worth the cash, but still only thin rubbish fabric and foam. The concept and design are great, and you can't beat the price. At the end of the day, though, you get what you pay for."
2,Listed size is a full size too small,Great shoe but realize that their sizes run very small. Get a minimum of a half size larger probably a full size is better.
3,A very casual shoe,"If you are looking for a dress shoe this is not it. After taking a single step, the crease of the shoe turned a light tan to white (the same effect as a big layer of wax on the shoe). This immediately changed the shoe from the brand new dress look, to an old jeans on the weekend look. I was looking for a pair of dress shoes, so I had to send these back."
2,Gimmee a Break!,"Despite an excess of characters, there isn't even one normal person in the book. There was one possible, but then you have to ask the question: What's wrong with him that he hangs out with all these whackos? The protagonist is the worst; I can't believe anyone could care about her, or what she does, or why. The flaccid and obscure preamble should have warned me. No one does anything remotely believable from start to finish."
3,Okay book,To me Kathy Mallory series are hit or miss and this is the latter one.The book did not keep me going and I had hard time finish reading it.
5,Savored every page of this book,"I was thrilled to find a new Kathy Mallory novel in the bookstore late last year. I immediately grabbed it and gave it to my husband. ""This is a Christmas present for me!"" And so it was.Couldn't put this one down at all -- I love the intricacies and characters in all of the Kathy Mallory novels. This one, in particular, kept me guessing until the end, and actually made me cry. Excellent, excellent book.When is the next one coming out? Can't wait!"
5,Great resource for the 20-30 something crowd,"Written in her warm, inimitable style, THE MONEY BOOK FOR THE YOUNG, FABULOUS & BROKE is an essential resource for the young twenty to thirty something crowd. Suze Orman has a firm grasp on this generations' financial troubles, and her upbeat and straightforward advice is clear and right on target."
4,Almost a perfect guide!,"This book was almost a perfect guide for me, except it didn't provide any help for what to do with your student loans once your in the mess of private loans i.e. Sallie Mae, who won't allow you to consolodate and don't lower their payments significantly for the young broke graduate."
4,Suze Orman Money Book,Some of it was easy and obvious but there were some things in there that were helpful. A good read for someone who is bad with money and pretty clueless.
4,Was on back order took a long time to get ot me,"This item was on back order and it took over a month to get to me, but it cam in good condition have not been able to read it yet."
4,SUZE DOES IT AGAIN,AWESOME BOOK!!! Suze is unbelievable in her knowledge of several financial areas. Organized and thorough. Touches on all subjects that should be of importance to Young people. Suze backs up her reputation as an expert once again!!! GREAT BOOK!!!
5,"The money book for the young,fabulous & broke",Excellent book- I will give it as a gift for our daughter atChristmas.
1,It's for the WAY young.,"I just found that a good portion of the book was aimed at those who are not yet off to college, or just stepping into that age bracket. Also, the info is a bit dated, as she even states 2004. SOOOOO much has changed in our economy since then, that it was hard to say if it would still apply. And a large portion of the book is dedicated to student loans, the other to car and home purchases, all things I have already made. I am not old, but not near that young either (27). The retirement savings may be helpful but............... I do think she is great but would go with another one of her books if you're past the 22 mark, lol."
2,shallow,"The title says it all - this is shallow meandering for a ""fabulous"" audience. Ormand is indeed popular on PBS, now that the network specializes in mindless pap, and pop. Ormand makes one good point; time is on the side of her audience, but there's not much substance in this book to ensure that these fabulous folks will enjoy a fabulous retirement on their fabulous lanais sipping their fabulous lattes. Said audience should get their advice from serious professionals, not from the financial equivalent of Daniel O'Donnell."
5,Suze Orman Book is awesomo!!,"A very simple, clear and concise book, it will give you the fundamentals for better financial education and financial habits."
3,For readers in their teens and 20's...,"I'm in my 30's and I've decided I'm just a little too old for this book - at least for the first half of it. Much of it didn't apply to me anymore *sniff*...But the second half contained helpful hints that I can use, about investing, explaining what the heck a Roth IRA is, etc, and helping me figure out how much life insurance we'd need if we have a child.I would recommend this book very HIGHLY as a gift for anyone in their late teens and 20's. The format is geared toward the young. It's easy on the eyes and easy to hold. The chapters remind me of web pages. There's lots of color and lots of boxes and summaries for the 'quick attention spans' among us.The only negative I can list is that it came out in 2007, before the economy really got bad, so some of the advice is a little outdated. (Although she does talk about the economic problems in 2002 and 2003!)"
4,Just Buy It,Most people my age aren't thinking of their financial future but for the ones that want to start a plan....buy this book! You probably won't be able to do everything she recommends but it's a good reference for when you're ready!
5,AMAZING CD!!!,"I am so thrilled that VAEDA - STATE OF NATURE is finally here. It has been long overdue but well worth the wait!The entire cd is incredible and I cannot stop playing it.I've seen this band live and their talent and passion are undeniable. This cd is exceptional and the live show even better!Each song on this cd is better than the next but some of my favorite's are ALL FOR YOU, BATTLE SONG, BITE MY TONGUE, JESUS RIDES THE SUBWAY, IMPERIAL AND CACOPHONY.I cannot wait to see what they do next!"
3,Entertaining Covers,"I actually didn't realize until later that most of these songs are covers by another artist. Perhaps it makes a difference that I'm not intimately familiar with the originals, but I rather enjoyed listening to the CD. Besides which, for a dollar, it's a great deal."
5,pleased,Purchased as a gift because you can't really find the blue granite ware in the stores except for the basic camping gear. Recipient loved it.
1,Book does NOT Deliver on the Promise,"If your are seriously interested in learning ""How to Attract, Manage and Retain Human Capital"" I would not spend time reading/skimming this book. It is a skin-deep look at the topic, and other than the notion that people are not ""human resources to be consumed"" but ""human capital to invest in"" there is little of note in this book. I heartily agree with the reviewer who notes that the book reads like a homework assignment written by accountants. If you are looking for sage advice on how to ""Attract, Manage and Retain"" (and Inspire) people to/in your organization, then I suggest you read biographies of great leaders, good literature, or books written by professionals in the field of organizational development and psychology. Books by folks like Peter Block, Steven Covey, or Peter Senge are much more useful and practical."
2,"Nice design. Subpar materials. Poor, poor warranty service.","I love the design of this watch. It looks even better that what you see on screen. The thinness is very cool.However, my band is starting to come apart after only four uses. I am very careful with my things and do not abuse them. I would expect a metal band to last a long time, but this one is coming apart on one side where it's welded to the bracket that holds the pin to the case.I called Skagen in NV and they said ""sorry, we only warrant the movement, not the band."" After pointing out that I expected the band to last more that four days, the lady transferred me to someone's voicemail in order to get rid of me. Classy, Skagen.This watch is great if you only plan to use it occasionally. Otherwise, look for something more sturdy. Other Skagen watches I own have worked great, but not this one."
1,Crystal Cracked with Cold...Band Clasp is Cheap/ Falls Apart,"First time I tried to put on the watch, I had to bend the tab to get the band to clasp properly. Then the adjustment piece came loose while wearing and off came the watch. Put it all back together, it worked for a couple of weeks until it again needed adjustment. It is an ongoing problem.Today I went outside. The crystal broke spontaneously as soon as the cold air hit the face.The watch looks nice, but it is poorly made. My advice would be to stay away from Skagen until they change the band clasp system and correct their crystal breakage problems."
5,"Great Product, Fast Shipping","The watch is wonderful! Original Packageing, Brand new, not a scratch on it (until I bumped a brick wall the other day and put one there myself). This was the best price I found after searching for this watch every day for 2 weeks straight. I was very satisfied with this purchase and I would recommend to anyone interested in a Skagen to look to Amazon before ever paying the $120+ that department stores charge for these awesome watches."
5,my grandson,I bought the pop-onz for my grandson who will be 2 years oldin July. He absolutely loves it. He loves to turn it on andthen stop it to hear the sound it makes while he holds theturntable. While its on he puts the pieces on and watches howthey go around. I would recommend the toy without any hestatation. Thank you for making such a wonderful product.Joan Levy
5,Terrific book,"This is a terrific book and a gold mine of info for anyone wanting to know more about Energy, especially how to experience it. I am a professional masseuse and this is a must-have book for all healers!"
4,Mastery of Awareness,"Mastery of Awareness is a new read to me. I look forward to reading the book, I am sure there is valuable information to be gleaned.Betty Murray"
3,"Fiesta plates-stick with a size, or a label","The plate is fine, it shipped on time and arrived in 1 piece, it turns out that it didn't match the rest of the set though. Apparently they make different size plates in different colors and they don't match up. This plate was smaller than the one that I was trying to replace and now just sits in the cupboard odd man out. In short watch the sizes when trying to buy one of these and measure carefully."
2,There are better options,"This is a re-release of the RCA complete Caruso set from the late 1980's. The transfers were made in the late 1970's at the dawn of the digital era and were state of the art for that time. But in cleaning up the surface noise these old digital transfers seriously flatten out the sound of Caruso's voice.I would suggest that people interested in Caruso check out the complete Caruso series on Naxos with new digital restorations by the great sound engineer/artist Ward Marston. (The Complete Recordings of Carusoand also on single discs). On the Naxos CD's the voice is preserved in a much more natural and subtle sound while all of the other noises are eliminated as much as possible. It's much more satisfying and true to the original recordings than these old RCA transfers. It's a little more expensive, but you should have the best available. It's only fair to Caruso."
1,Use as a last resort,I am a teacher and have tried using multiplication rock in class. Most of the songs are not very catchy sounding and my students had a difficult time memorizing the facts. It is not worth the money and I found that pairing stories to facts is more effective than this cd. Only buy it if nothing else is working for your child or class.
4,good book,it got me out of trouble on sum repairs of my old IHC truck. it helped out on fixing a generator problem.
1,"Good idea, but never worked...","Couldn't get it to charge from AC or the sun, so I returned it and got a $40 USB battery that works like a charm. Once this product is perfected I'll probably try it again, but it's just not ready."
1,Good Concept,"Just got this product as a gift and I thought it was a great concept. Sadly, it doesn't work. Tried charging my blackberry with around 6 hours of direct sunlight on my hotel balcony in Guam. I couldn't think of a more opportune setting to use this product and I couldn't get a charge."
4,Very Effective At Stopping Colds In Their Tracks,"After having heard commercials for Cold-Eeze on WOR-AM Radio in New York by Joan Hamburg years ago, I finally decided to give this cold remedy a chance. I had virtually no success with competing product Airborne, so what did I have to lose? For the several times I have taken Cold-Eeze (including this week, when I have come down with a virus at my Indianapolis home), Cold-Eeze has made me feel much better than when I first got sick, though I probably should have started taking Cold-Eeze right at the outset. I have tried both the honey lemon and strawberry cream flavors; the strawberry is a refreshing change of pace from the plain Jane honey lemon. I would definitely recommend Cold-Eeze as the fastest way to end a cold."
2,Quick dry?,These towels are advertised to be great for quick-drying hair both on pets and people. We tried it on our dog and on my medium length hair. It certainly was not a better towel than our regular bath towels. I don't recommend them at all.
3,An Okay First Effort,"In Kanar's first book, a medical thriller called The J Factor, he has created an interesting and imaginative plot that will hold your interest. However, there really aren't very many surprises for a book almost 400 pages long and it ends with with some subplots being resolved too abruptly. The suspense would have been more intense if The J Factor was 50-100 pages shorter. Kanar is an author with a lot of potential, and I'm looking forward to his next book. The J Factor is a book that is worth reading but don't rush to put it at the top of your ""To Be Read"" list."
3,Harry Potter Collection,"So far, I haven't been able to get the Sorcerers Stone to install, but The Chamber of Secrets installed but wont let me get to the Gold cards and I'm not sure why. I've tried in two different games. NOT GOOD! VERY FRUSTRATING.But the ordering part and the delivery part were handled very professionally"
1,Crap,The rotor blade is made of some kind of plastic and broke after install....everyone should go for the pumps with steel/metal rotor baldes
1,Not the same as the Picture,"Don't buy... total waste as the picture and the review said ""Metal Impeller"". When product arrived it was PLASTIC. Total False Advertising. Wasted my time having to send it back and now I have to buy another.This is PLASTIC and not like the picture. Also the reviewer who said it was Metal must have had another product, so who wants to take a chance???"
4,Rare book that shows HOW leaders made decisions...,"Most 'leadership' and business books are theortical. Johnson's book actually adds some entertianment value to it's leadership ""how to"" since it encompasses indivdidual stories from leaders who have faced challenges. It is like 19 mini-novels in one book.My favorite was the story of how a man took a stand risking certain bankruptcy to make all car dealerships ban odometer roll-backs.I don't know why the new book - TL2 isn't out on Amazon. As good as the first is, Transparent Leader 2 is even more amazing."
4,Thrilling,"Carolyn Keene shows her talent with the writing of this book. Nancy surprises Ned with a visit to his basketball tournament, but Nancy was the one to be surprised when she found Ned kissing a redhead cheerleader! The cheerleader later disappears, and Nancy is worries if she finds her, and solves the case, she'll be the one to bring the two together! Great reading material."
5,GENIUS JAZZ PIANO TRIO PERFORMANCE,"THIS IS ONE OF THE SPECIAL JAZZ PERFORMANCES EVER RECORDED. GARNER WAS A MAGICIAN AND THIS WAS ONE OF HIS SPECIAL MOMENTS. IF YOU SEEK MUSIC THAT MAKES YOU SMILE AND NOD IN RECOGNITION OF SOMETHING SPECIAL, TRY THIS. THE ONLY GLITCH IS THE TECHNICAL MEDIOCRITY OF THE RECORDING.THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DISCS THAT DEMANDS REMASTERING WITH THE BEST OF MODERN RECORDING TECHNOLOGY. IT IS THAT SPECIAL. THOSE WITH THE ABILITY TO DO SO, OWE IT TO MUSIC TO REMASTER THIS SPECIAL PERFORMANCE BY ONE OF THE SPECIAL JAZZ GENIUSES OF ALL TIME."
3,Stoped working and would like to know what my options are,I love this watch but recently it stoped working. Changed battery but it was not it. I would like to know what my options are?
5,"Mother, if in Heaven there are no apples, I don't want to go","This book takes you back to Christel's childhood in war-torn Germany. She captivates your attention in telling her story. The short chapters make it easy to pick up the book and read for a short period of time, as often as you like. Even though she shares the hardships of growing up, it is in a loving setting. Her sense of humor keeps it interesting."
1,I don't even think I'm going to finish it.,"This type of book is right up my alley. I'm a Francophile. It normally doesn't take much quaint Frenchyness to please me, but somehow this book completely lacks it. I just read over some of the low-scoring reviews and feel I have permission to not even finish it. It's just boring! The first several evenings of reading the book, my impression was, ""she's not a very good writer."" I doubted myself, ""she's a successful writer, how can this be?"" I don't know. Here's how I'd sum it up: her stories don't transport one to France. I really don't care about how ""luxurious"" it feels walking on the in-floor heating in her house. The most interesting thing about this book (I bought a used copy) was the business cards and boarding pass (not for a flight to France, sadly) that fell from it's pages. TryFrom Here, You Can't See Paris: Seasons of a French Village and Its Restaurantby Michael S. Sanders, instead."
1,She should have stayed at home,"I'm afraid I really disliked this book - I felt that the author was very negative about the majority of French people that she met, and seemed to find more to criticise than to praise. It seemed that a lot of the problems she encountered were generated by her own lack of tact and understanding . I wonder why she moved to live in France when she disapproved of so much. (And I didn't find her recipes very authentic - I have never been served the sort of things she cooks in any restaurant in France, thank goodness)."
4,Delicieux,"Being a Francophile of the highest order I devoured Susan Herrmann Loomis' book avariciously. She captures the joys and pitfalls of living and working in Normandy with charm, wit and delicious recipes. Susan - please write some more; as a writer Ms Loomis encapsulates all that I aspire to food and travel - is there more to life?"
4,Charming memoir-a little dated,"This is a charming memoir of the author/foodwriter's time spent in France. She ventures from her cooking class at the famed La Varenne in Paris to a small village in France. After falling in love with France, French cuisine and making friends in and out of Paris, she eventually returns to France with her husband and child. They lovingly restore a historic home in the center of town of a small village. If you are a foodie and a Francophile, you will enjoy this memoir as it evokes the way of life in a small French town, the friendliness, the bureaucracy, the beauty. It is a bit dated but that is ok. A smattering of recipes is always an added bonus!"
3,Enjoyed living in France,"I enjoyed reading this book and livng in France vicariously through this book. The writing isn't that great, but the experiences were entertaining."
1,Clones,Anyone who really listens to metal will agree with this statement: Put this band to sleep ASAP. They are clones of the industry and themselves.I had such high hopes for them after their first album. I will not buy another CD from them until they stop trying so hard.This is watered down metal at its finest. They don't know if they want to be on high rotation on MTV or be metal. Oh the HORROR of my beloved metal. This scene is dying from all the clones. There should be only ONE Killswitch Engage not fifty.
5,GREATALBUM!!!!!,"I have come to the realization that to just listen to a cd is totally different than going to see them. Diecast is GREAT and Paul is also. I have never listened to this kind of music before, but going to see any band live will change your mind. I think they are Great and hope they continue for a long time. Thanks"
3,Good-Looking,"This is an attractive and slim watch. The only problems I had is that the gold plated is wearing off (after 1 yr), and I caught the mesh band on an object and it distorted and now snags clothing."
2,dissapointed,"I am a big Jane's Addiction fan, but when I got this DVD home and started watching I was a bit dissapointed in the performing. Vocal wasn't powerful enough and music on ""Jane Says"" was missing the cool instrument (unsure of what it's called) I am used to hearing."
4,"story line was good, easily be considered as ""A Classic""","It's one of those movies easily considered a classic such as ""Scarface"" or ""The Godfather""...but I personally found the beginning little long and drugout. Overall the storyline is great, filled with great actors and characters were believable."
1,What's all the fuss?,"I don't know what film Dave Woosey was watching, but if it's the same film (or file?)that I watched then I don't know what all the fuss is about. This film was the most boring film ever. I would much rather watch Bugsey Malone (the musical) it's more true to life."
1,"Great movie, [crummy] DVD","Lacking in special features, even the print index for the 2 discs is incorrect. The sound options are also limited. This looks like some rush job that will eventually be re-released as a special edition somewhere down the road."
2,So Melodramatic I couldn't wait for it to end.,I was excited to see this because it was about the Jewish gangster era. I guess they acted just like any other gangsters of that area so it didn't really matter if they were Jewish or not and seeing Robert DeNiro and the rest spouting Jewish sayings seemed silly.It was a very long movie that went back and forth in time and it was so blah and melodramatic that I'm sorry to say I couldn't wait for it to end. I didn't care about any of them by the end.
2,Dont beleive the hype,"Ok this movie takes you on a journey. Movies ofcourse do, but this is just not worth it. Its a fair story but it just doesnt have enough to justify its length.I would not recommend it."
4,a classic,"his is an epic, episodic tale of the lives of a small group of New York City Jewish gangsters spanning over 40 years. The movie centers on David 'Noodles' Aaronson (Robert De Niro) and his lifelong partners in crime, Max (James Woods), Cockeye (William Forsythe) and Patsy (James Hayden) and their friends, who all grew up in New York's Lower East Side in the 1920s-1930s. In the late 1960s, an elderly Noodles returns to New York after many years in hiding to look into the past.Told mostly in flashbacks and flash-forwards, this film is a classic that has us discover great actors, including Jennifer Connelly and Brian Bloom. It features a great cast, like Danny Aiello and Joe Pesci.One of the masterpieces in film history worth watching.If you have 4 hours to spare, take your time to watch it. It's worth it - at least once in your lifetime - for the cinematography, the acting, the music, and the directing."
5,great movie,I have seen the movie years ago and i thought it was an excellant movie. I had a copy of the movie but i misplaced it so i had to order another one.
1,wrong format,i never got to watch it tried it on 3 dvd players it was wrong format threw it in trash
1,Cracked CD,"I saw the review left by G. Waggoner before I purchased the book and was kind of worried. Well, my worries were justified. I received the book and the CD was cracked. I then got the replacement and the CD was also cracked. I will now think twice before ordering any books which are supplemented with a CD from Amazon."
4,King of the Jungle,"Tarzan lacks the sparkle and polish of Disney's The Lion King, when it strays from the animated film. But this cd has its good points. The music that does recall the film is absolutely inspired. This is another one of those cds your munchkins can listen to as you run your errands. Mom and dad won't mind either because the songs are that feel-good. If you're tired of your hard core gangster rap, and your country crooning, buy this little gem which is guaranteed to brighten your day and make you feel oh-so positive about life. I recommend this CD for everyone who's stuck in a rut or ho-humming it along, and wants to try something different. Guess what? It works like a charm. I've got people who normally would be embarrassed to be caught dead with a Disney cd, handing me back my copy at work, thanking me. I should be charging these people. But seeing the smile this item puts on their faces is compensation enough. A must-have palliative, but musical enthusiasts might find it so-so."
2,A wonderful fiasco,"It' curious how an interesting history can be not well told by a modern music. In some cases the music go to the hand with the story, but not in this CD, in which we say the music that it is not for the story. I didn't ejoyed with that CD"
2,Boring,"Boring on disc...not a true musical theatre score at all! Not Disney's best effort, but it will be a cash cow.Visually interesting on stage, but not enough to make for the extra-slim story line. Kids will love it."
1,Forgettable,"Don't be fooled, this does not even come close to other musical works of disney such as beauty and the beast. I can't believe people actually rated that they like this! It must be because they must never heard the original music recording of the animated movie. The songs here are cheap imitations of good songs in a good score. The score is just all around bland. True the lyrics aren't clever but that might have been overlooked if it had at least a good score behind them but no....P.S. Tarzan sounds like a woman"
1,Disappointed,"Thought I would get a new edition as I was so inspired by an edition used in the 1980s. Sadly, it is now watered down and average....all that is left are few beautiful poems. I found the text from the 1980s full of wonderful pieces of art, music, history...great examples of 'communication'....this text is 'corporatized' and therefore 'boring.' In it's infancy, this book was life-changing and full of color and sweeping dimension....sadly it has aged and has gotten 'stiff.' Anybody want my copy?"
4,Buying this for class? Consider this:,"Do not buy this version of the book if you want this for a college class. If you need the workbook to go along with it, but the ""Cengage Advantage Books"" version, which has the workbook inline with every chapter, which is a HUGE money saver. The workbook itself costs more than the Cengage book. The only difference in books is that the paperback version is not printed in color; but is that really worth your money?Cengage Advantage Books: Looking Out, Looking In"
2,Not good for kids,"I purchased two x-small sizes for my twin 10 year old kids. Both packs fit well and were quite light even if they did have limited space. But on our first backpacking trip one daughter started complaining about chafing on her back at mile 4. Even after lightening her load, I had to take her pack at mile 5. It was on mile 3 of our second trip that the other daughter started having the same problem. I had a good friend tell me, 'Always get external frame packs for kids.' That's good advice. We've now replaced these Gregory packs with external frame packs from Outdoor Products and the chafing has come to an end."
4,small,"I purchased this watch for my hubby as a birthday present and was a little disappointed. It is a beautiful watch and visually, looks like the picture. I was aware that it was slim, which was what i was looking for but the watch face is alot smaller than expected, about the size of a bigger faced woman's watch. I think the picture of the arm with the watch is kind of deceiving. I would say it's about the size of a 50 cent piece. other than that detail, it was as described and is beautiful. my hubby said he liked it but not sure if he was just telling me that or not."
1,Poor product not worth your time.,"I love the thin design of this watch and it is easy to read at a glance. The real issue is the time tested issue with thin watches, what I am saying is they simply don't hold the time well. I have had the watch only a few days and it seems to loose apron 5 minutes per day this is a big issue since you would loose 35 minutes a week so this watch gets a F rating from me the simple task of telling time is simply to much for this pice. I love the look and the thin design is wonderful it is like wearing air on your wrist.it is made from a wonderful titanium and the rounded face is great at reducing glare. in the end I must say this is not worth the money or time to even glance twice at this time pice. I would return it if I could because it simply cant do the job it was created to do. 0 of 10 RatingSkagen Men's 233LTMN Titanium Black Mesh Watch"
5,Even good for nudists,"This watch is so light and thin but so good-looking that even my husband, who doesn't like watches weighing him down, wears it every day. After three months I don't see any wearing away of the band and the face seems to really resist scratching, because it still looks perfect."
2,the clasp was inferior,i purchased this watch for my husband august 22nd we recieved it on the 26th of august.we liked it the clasp did not close at first then the next day my husband tried the watch again and pressed hard on the clasp we went to church and later breakfast and my husband realized that the watch was missing from his wrist..the clasp was not right it did not engage as it should..Meanwhile I have sent a total of 7 emails to amazon on this issue and also have put a claim against Imperial watches as per instruction on my amazon account..the only emails I got were to send the watch back and Fedex Address slips...which as you can surmise is totally redundant since the watch is gone..I have asked in my claim which you must have in your files for a replacement with a better clasp or a refund....I await your reply edith carballada
3,Beautiful-but.,"No Doubt this is a beautiful looking watch. The blue catches sunlight and the size of the watch will work with most wrists. The one major problem with this Skagen is the mesh band. The clasp is not designed well. They could have had a much more simple and effective clasp for this watch. If buying Skagen, I would go with the leather or metal band. Within two days, this fell off my wrist twice. A little more thought on a better mesh band would solves this problem."
5,SKAGEN,"I received the watch very quickly, in perfect condition and it is great looking. Very good value."
3,Beautiful but...,"I loved the appearance of this watch. But, didn't like the clasp on the band. More importantly, specs stated it had luminous hands--it didn't."
4,Skagen Watch,My husband really likes this watch and likes the thinness of it. He said he needs to use it longer to give it more than 4 stars. He has owned it for about a month. No problems.
5,Skagen,"An excellent example of Danish design and quality. Easily adjustable band, classic good looks - not ostentatious. Reasonable price, very reasonable considering the quality"
4,Wonderful Watch,It is difficult to see what the watch looks like in any pictures. The bezel is black and just like the wrist band but does have a very reflective shine. It does not look green like in some of the pictures (gun metal). The best part about the watch is how light it feels on the wrist. The clasp on this watch slightly giggles/clicks when my wrist moves... which is why I had to give it a 4/5
3,goood looking watch,Just a few things! the color of the dial is more black then blue.not like the picture!! the clasp is very flimsey.hard to adjust.Its a good looking watch but for every day use I don't know.seems like it would not take much abuse..
3,"Nice watch, awkward strap fastener",This is a sleek and good looking watch but the strap fastener design is awful. If you can put up with this then the watch is very nice.
4,Great Watch,"I have been using this watch every day since I got it and I really like it. What's there to say about watches really? I guess I would like to share a couple of things I was surprised about -1) It's thin! - I mean I knew it was thin but when I actually got it, I was a bit taken aback. It's Swatch Skins thin.2) The clip is a bit fiddly - It's a bit tough (for me anyway) to clip it properly. I'm still not sure if I am doing it right.But really, I like this watch a lot and if you're wanting a nice thin watch of this design, I highly recommend it!"
5,Excellent Treatment of a Tough Subject,"I bought this book in 1996 when I was a CS graduate student. The course text was the traditional ""dragon book"" which is a complete nigthmare to understand. I read this book in hopes of better understanding how compilers and interpreters are implemented and to this day I feel like I hit the jackpot.The book focuses primarily on the practical implementation of language interpreters and compilers and includes the code (C++) for a full featured Pascal interpreter (not just a minimal implementation that interprets a few statements). The author walks the reader through each class virtually line by line and presents the material in a way that any intermediate level C++ developer can easily understand.Notwithstanding the pragmatic focus of this book, it also provides excellent treatment of the theory of compiler design. While it is at least 5 years old, I still keep this book in my library."
4,Highly informative,"I recommend this to anyone wishing to understand the human mind. Rita Carter's book contains the most up to date research on how it functions under varying conditions. Her descriptions are clear and concise as she illustrates the different parts of the brain and how they seem to function. While brain research is still in its infancy, Mapping the Mind will offer the reader insights that may be helpful to their understanding."
2,falls apart,"My toddler LOVES taking this toy apart. Sadly, that's not why we purchased it!!! Thing is, it falls apart so easily, it becomes more of a parts toy that can go in and out of the toy box, rather than being at all useful as an actual toy garage. For the price, we expected so much more.On a bright note, he really does love the cars. He can push them around individually but loves to connect the magnets and make train sounds while rolling them around."
2,Comes apart very easily.,"It's a great looking toy but the parts don't snap together they rest in place, had I known that, I would have passed on this one. I returned it. I was spending a good part of my day putting it back together over and over again. It also should come with a helocopter for the helocopter pad but doesn't so the kids put the cars up there, it's confusing..."
3,Too many typos,"There were way too many misspelled words, nothing that couldn't be figured out. But it was distracting for my reading."
3,Only okay,"Got it free and the book description sounded interesting. Started out okay, but did not really ""flesh out"" the characters enough.It was just interesting enough to keep me reading...but definitely not a page-turner. Had to get far into the book in orderto find out background on the main character. Over all the book was worth the ""free"" price. I was hoping to find a newauthor for me to read. I usually read the biggie authors for mysteries."
3,silent joe review,"Typical Parker novel, though not his best. Well worth the cost of admission. Somewhat surprised at the amount of punctuation errors and lack of punctuation when needed. Was this just a copy from the printed page, or some sort of Kindle problem?"
4,Enjoyable,"I'm enjoying the story, but I've yet to run across a book with so many typos. Feint instead of faint, fee instead of the. It's quite distracting."
2,"Good from afar, far from good","I have read several books written by Parker and have generally enjoyed his work. This coupled with the rave reviews had my expectations set high. On the surface the main character is unique but as you get deeper he really proved to be bland, boring and a bit unrealistic. The plot is nothing special and the love interest and action scenes just seemed farfetched. As one reviewer mentioned, once you get past the fact that the main character is physically flawed and scared, there is little else of interest."
2,Silent Joe Should Have Stayed Mum,"One of the worst books I've read through in a long, long time. If it got 43 5 star reviews all I can guess is that the author has a huge extended family to write them for him. In the past year and a half I've read a lot of free Kindle books and this had the sloppiest formatting of any I've come across. There must have been more than ONE HUNDRED missing periods, commas and quotation marks. Talk about slopping spellcheck? Time after time the reader comes across things that look like the jokes one sees about how auto correct screws things up. Even for free this book wasn't worth it."
5,A different point of view,"I found this book to be both well written and intriguing. i believe that the hero has Aspergers, judging from the way that he thinks and speaks. His soul is clean, even though he's had to do some despicable deeds. His adoptive father raised him well, and explained how life works as he was growing up. I'd recommend this book to those who like a book that offers more than thrills, one that makes you think, too."
2,"Beautiful design, but basically junk","I looked at a lot of these watches and the designs are really superb! However, like other reviewers have pointed out, the black on the band scratches easily. Also, mine arrived DOA. I took it to a watch repair place and had them check the battery. I was a bit suprised to see MADE IN CHINA stamped on the inside. They had to replace the movement. I am disappointed."
2,No go.,"The watch is handsome like many Skagen watches but the clasp is delicate, weak and breakable and it lacks a ""second"" hand, again, like many skagen watches."
3,Nice looking Dress Watch,"I really like the look of this watch. I'm having trouble with the clasp not staying closed, but other than that, it's perfect."
1,It might be a good watch if I could actually get it to stay on my arm.,This is the second Skagen mesh band watch I have had to return because of problems with the bracelet clasp. It is difficult to lock and then comes apart.
5,Great Commentary,this video is awesome!!! a must see and a perfect item to any sports fan's collection...the insight and history of the rivalry are presented very well!!!
1,Very Disappointed,My Husband is a big fan of Larry Bird so when I foung this DVD was excited about it. Got it in in a timely fashion if was just the interview itself that was disappointing. Alot of cussing had to fast forward through some of the parts. My husband wound up going to bed. Sure don't want children watching it. If you don't like to set and listen to harsh cuss words don't buy this.
1,The Problem,"The problem Socrides faces is that he never is able to explain in a creditable way why homosexualty needs curing. Instead, most of his assertions can also be used to support a view that homophobia has a negative impact on the life of normal homosexuality.Why not try curing left-handedness, red hair, or some other normal variation in human life? I am sure we can find some excuse for asserting that these characteristics somehow damage those who possess them."
3,When the Mob Ran Vegas,"OK Book, helped by the fact that I am interested in Las Vegas gossip. Lots of interesting anecdotes experienced by the author. Good for a read on the flight to LV."
4,Very Comprehensive,"This book is considered by many to be THE reference for knots. Most professional Navy Boatswains Mates I know own this book and use it regularly. Although the instructions can be difficult to follow for the beginner, there is enough material to keep the decorative knot-tier going for a long time. The background material is interesting as well. An invaluable reference for the professional seaman or boy scout."
1,Disappointed/cheap quality,"I purchased this TC to go along with a Sigma 150-500mm. First off I noticed there was movement in the construction of the TC, there is a seam where the TC was put together and it had lots of flex. This is not my first multiplier and I have never seen such a condition. I returned it for a refund. Also I was disappointed to find out this TC doesn't offer the auto focus feature to work when mated with 150-500mm lens. This is the way it is designed, not a defect. IMO I will spend an extra $250 and go with a Nikon TC. I tried a Nikon 1.4xTC and the auto focus feature worked when hooked up with my Sigma 150-500mm lens, but costs almost $500. I will say in all my years buying from Amazon this was my first return ever, and their return policy was stellar. I like Amazon with how there return policy is handled."
4,good but could be better.,This teleconverter fulfills all claims except the AF compatibility.image quality stays good. my only harp is that for the price AF could be maintained a little better. I have used it with a Sigma 300F4 lens and the AF really hunts.
2,Check Compatibility First,This teleconverter was not compatible with any of my three lenses. Within the Sigma telecoverter documentation it clearly stated what lenses it could be used with but there is no such documentation available on Amazon.com.
1,Does not fit any of my nikon lenses,I just got this teleconverter yesterday...Could not wait to try it out...For some reason it does not fit all the lenses mentioned which I own :(I will have to send it back which is a great disappointment. Do any of the previous reviewers know why this could be?
2,Does NOT fit the Sigma 70-300mm lens,"I have purchased 2 seperate ones assuming that the 1st one was defective. Although it says Nikon mount, the teleconverter fitted my Nikon D5000 camera but the other end did not fit my Sigma 70-300mm DG lens (Nikon Mount). It also did not attach to my Nikon 18-55mm DX lens. Apparantly this teleconverter is for a Nikon mount on ene side and a different lens type on the other."
3,Good For Young,"This is a fine read for very young readers, 9 to 12. Beyond that, the child is more likely to put it down."
1,"Not journalism, Not honest","Rather than address individually the many blatant misrepresentations Pilger promotes in ""The New Rulers of the World,"" I encourage readers to independently verify his claims.For example, Pilger cites Professor Rokke (a US army physicist ""responsible for cleaning up Kuwait"" after the Gulf War) as claiming that the use of depleted uranium is ""a form of nuclear warfare,"" while attempting to argue that depleted uranium is the cause for an apparently disturbing increase in cancer rates among the Iraqi population in Basra. Unfortunately, these claims have absolutely no basis in reality, and a quick trip to the World Heath Organization's Website quickly confirms this...That Pilger would so blatantly lie and distort the facts in a fanatical attempt to impose his ideological view on his readership is, at the very least, a form of journalistic malpractice. Remember dear readers: Although governments do lie, so, unfortunately, do journalists."
2,Disappointed,"I've got this shoe in black patent. I trusted the brand, but this particular style is so hard that it made blisters on my feet the first time I wore it. The material looks kind of cheap too."
5,Wonderful for all ages!,"This is a fantastic toy! I bought it for my 2 year old for Christmas and it is still the only toy he will play with! He even carries the four trains in his backpack everywhere! It is extremely durable, fun, creative and even my 5 year old twins like it!"
3,Broken!!!,Along with the numerous other reviews we have had nothing but problems with this and 2 other different trains with remotes. Trains begin to slow down as if it were a battery issue. Not a battery issue. Keep replacing batteries hoping it will fix itself but now after reading all the other bad reviews I will begin contacting Fisher Price for some possible remedy.
4,Way Cool!,"This is one of the most fun toys we have. I bought it for my 3-year-old son but it's a favorite of all of my kids (7 1/2-year-old daughter, 6-year-old daughter, 3-year-old son, 1 1/2-year-old son). The concept of using the power of the train to make the railroad-side items work is very creative. And it's great that everything can be hand-pushed or cranked in case you don't want to use the batteries or they run down. The remote is so easy! We love everything about it and can't wait to get more parts. It's a great family-fun toy!"
5,The other America indeed,"Nice mix of anecdote and historical background on life in inner city America. Excellent insight into the everyday difficulties faced by families and some of the root causes. This book, though almost 20 years old, still has a message that needs to be heard."
4,"The way all remakes should be, as good as the original!","Like Tom and Nicole in ""Eyes Wide Shut"", Alec and Kim do a fantastic job and play the roles made famous by Mcqueen and Mcgraw Brilliantly. This fresh, vibrant remake takes it a bit further than the original due to modern-day censors, (in Australia this film was given an R rating)which gives the film a very gritty feel. But the film belongs to star couple Alec and Kim who both do some of there best work ever. (the Getaway is Kim's best along with L.A Confidential and it's Alec's best along with the Hunt for Red October) On whole, I like it better than the original because of its harsh realism, its brilliant cast, which also includes James Woods and Micheal Madsen, and really because Kim is sooo Good looking."
4,Very good,"It is a fun movie and the scenes between them are extremely hot. The Alec/Kim sandwich is so shocking revealing that you're like---WOW. Its a fun movie, and sometimes movies are simply meant to be fun."
1,Pretty boy Alec Baldwin ruins the film,"This is a movie that did not need to be remade- the definitive version is with Steve McQueen and Sam Peckinpah. That version was gritty, hard- edged...This version has all the edginess of the latest Vogue. I have yet to see a movie Alec Baldwin has not tainted in some way..."
1,What a stupid movie.,"This is a poor remake of a classic. I could barely sit through the thing. The action scenes are good, yet unbelievable. The sex seens with Alec and Kim are done well. Otherwise, the movie sucks. The basic plot is poorly laid out and therefore vaguely interesting, but the subplots are ridiculous. Alec Baldwin does a crummy job of portraying the tough guy in this movie - he comes off arrogant and smug more than anything else. Kim Basinger is great in her role, but overshadowed by the rest of the poor acting and stupid subplots that surround her. Jennifer Tilly does a good job in an idiotic role. If you want to see Kim Basinger naked, borrow this movie from someone else. Bottom line - don't waste your money on it - you'll be mad at yourself if you do. Only a complete idiot could enjoy this crummy film."
1,what is das efx anyways?,"I don't know what these two 'musicians' were thinking when they put out this album. It's horrible. I am still wondering why I bought this in the first place. If you want real rap, then check out N.W.A. I can't stand to listen to a single song of theirs."
3,oriental scrutiny,"Beautiful watch---the sparklies instead of numbers actually make it easier to figure out what time it is with poor eyesight, and the mesh band is comfortable and sleek. I'm afraid to wear it out of the house, however, because the parts that make the watchband stay together fly apart without provocation, and I end up on hands and knees, with glasses, trying to collect it all from where it is playing hide-and-seek on the oriental carpet."
1,truly disappointing,"I am truly disappointed with the poor quality of this watch,even though it cost $100.00. I bought it 2 months ago and already the one pointer has broken.As it is more than 2 months I can return the watch at my own cost and have 1/2 of the original price refunded and bear the cost of return fees to a country outside USA.Not sure I would waste my money on such a poor performance product again"
5,This watch stood out for its elegant design and function,My wife is one of those people with a small wrist. There was additional capacity to make the band fit a smaller wrist after it was adjusted to fit hers. She has continued to wear it and likes the visibility of the analog display.
1,Waste of money,Very disappointed with this item. Very little content about German paratroops. It's more like a general history of WW2. The first DVD had almost no footage of paratroops and the second one was only a little better. They were even showing pictures of regular German infantry and calling them paratroopers. I would NOT recommend buying this to anyone. You can get more info and more pictures in a book. And there are historical DVDs about German paratroops that have a lot more content than this.
4,Wow a Portuguese Gay Movie...,"As a Portuguese guy it was interesting to find a gay Portuguese movie....it is strange but also interesting. A young ""Lisboeta"" falling for some one he cannot have....i think it's happened to all of us atleast once. His fettish is a bit out there...but hey to each-his-own."
2,O Fantasma,"Normally, I have a higher tolerance for ""art-house"" movies than most people, but ""O Fantasma"" was just too bizarre. And let's face it, folks: this is just a fancy, high-class porn -- a really messed-up one at that. It's just one sexually explicit scene after another without much of a story or dialogues, and what starts off as a weird, disturbing movie eventually becomes downright creepy. And what's up with the last 15 minutes of the film? I just found myself uttering ""what the...?"" over and over again. Also, much has been made of the fact that the movie is almost entirely filmed at night, but I found that rather annoying. It was like looking through a series of under-exposed photographs and my eyes are still hurting from squinting so much. It was ""intriguing"" though, to say the least. I'll give it that much."
2,not so hot,"The cover is by far the best art in this book... There are some other good ones inside, but most are incredibly poorly drawn and not very erotic at all; why they bothered putting a hard cover on such an amateurish effort is beyond me. Even the ones that are well drawn mostly just look like normal women with wings added as an afterthought. Bottom line, I'll snip out a few pictures to keep as art reference and throw away the rest."
1,Pornography with wings,"I don't know I expected when I ordered the hardbound edition of this book, but was certainly surprised to find it is merely Playboy centerfolds (or what I think a Playboy centerfold might look like, as I have never seen one) with wings!Threw the book into the dumpter. So much for ""art""!"
2,LOL!!!! A tribute to Clay LOL!!!! :D,"I was browsing in amazon for a good tribute album and i found this... a string quartet tribute to a guy who was SECOND in a poor COMMERCIAL competition judged by teenagers around USA!!! i just can't stop to laugh... I accept that this guy have a good voice, but nothing else, he just have one mediocre record!...After this album, ANYONE will deserve a tribute....I haven't heard the cd (i don't think i will) but i will give my vote and give you one recommendation based on this: LISTEN THE PREVIEWS BEFORE GET THIS CDS AND THINK IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN 40 OR 50 MINUTES OF THIS!!"
3,Nice Watch,"The watch is very nice and looks exactly like the picture - perfect for a ""dressy"" or business casual watch. The only issue with it (why I rated it 3 starts instead of 5) is that after a few wears, and without dropping it or anything, my fiance took the watch out to find that it had a completely cracked face. According to the Skagen website, the cost to replace the crystal is ~$30, which is half the cost of what I paid for it. We are going to call to see if there is anything they will do for us, but I question the overall quality of the watch if this could happen without dropping/banging the watch on anything."
3,"Really Fun, kind of nerve jangling band better live","where you can really enjoy Eddie's stage antics. While this CD has some really fun songs like 'Modern Art', 'Good Weekend' and 'My Little Brother' other songs are just grating like '18,000 Lira'. This band definitely has a unique sound and like I said are really fun live."
2,Very basic-some inaccuracies,"This is an Ok place to start if you really know nothing. That said there are some areas where the advice is poor, if not downright incorrect. (Using two mics to record speech and then ""blending"" them in the edit will cause the audio to be out-of-phase i.e. unlistenable)"
5,Delightful story to share with children,"This is my favorite book from my childhood. I teach English as a Second Language and always take this book in during Halloween to read to my students. They always enjoy it and it helps them learn some of the vocabulary associated with that holiday. As to the people who have worked very hard to find any racist thread running through this precious book...What nonsense! The title refers to the main character's clothing and to the transformation that takes place in her heart and demeanor. You are in such a hurry to be offended, much like the old black witch herself, that you've completely missed the point of the story. Try correcting your own ignorance before accusing others of that particular fault.If you're looking for a delightful book with a good story that teaches a lesson at the same time, try this one."
5,Memories! It was a favorite of my son and I got it for him to read with his son.,great story and recipe for blueberry pancakes...Read and bake together. My son remembered the title after all the years small wonder after reading it over and over as a boy.
4,Important topic that shouldn't be forgotten,"This movie shows the horrors of the early HIV outbreak in graphic detail and features many cameos. More and more, HIV/AIDS is being viewed as a chronic health condition even though it can still be a deadly disease. The main character in this movie (Mathew Modine) is outstanding and his drive to identify the cause of AIDS is inspiring. It was also really interesting to see all of the political issues involved in the process of identifying HIV--the scientific community squabbling over credit, President Reagan ignoring the plight of gay men, San Fran shutting down the bath houses, etc. I think the movie is still relevant today because HIV is now a world-wide crisis and it seems that little progress has been made in many developing countries. Also, it is important to remember the victims of the eighties and early nineties before better meds were created."
2,Great - if you're a pre-teen.,"These sunglasses look beautiful in the photo, however the description fails to mention that the frames are small - very small. I don't have a big head (at least in size ;-) ) and these sunglasses were very, very tight. I don't believe that those with an average size head will find these comfortable. I've purchased Chanel sunglasses in the past, and never had a problem with fit or comfort.Unfortunately, they've been returned, hence the low rating. The quality was what you'd expect of Chanel and the amount you're spending. If they had been the proper size, they would have been lovely sunglasses."
1,Please Do Not Waste Your Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This CD is such a waste of time. If you are a true OUTKAST fan back to the days of Southernplayalisticadilakfunkymisick (you know what I mean) then you will be highly offended. This is a mockery of great music. Please do not support such blatant nonsense.
1,The packing of the object is completely different from the picture,"The packing is simple and crude,different the picture.Use feel not good.I will not recommend it to anyone."
3,21st Century Poco,"If not for a few dead spots, this could have been a great record. Poco's first new album in over a decade also has some great moments. Rusty Young breaks out his mandolin and pedal steel on quite a few tracks, and the amazing harmony vocals that herald the return of prodigal drummed George Grantham brought back many memories of the great Poco albums of the 1970's. This album is by no means a disappointment and I would encourage any Poco fan to pick it up. A little more Paul Cotten and a little more vocal energy from Rusty Young could have made this a 4 or 5 start record."
4,from the mixed up files of mrs basil e frankweiler,"this book is a classic... it is clever and adventurous, and other kids who love mysteries will enjoy this..."
4,A decent book worth reading,"This book is a pretty good book. This book is amusing, and it is also entertaining. It is a good use of time. I think that there are more slightly better quality books. This book was cool because in parts there are a lot of exquisite actions such as where they sleep in the museum, what they try to discover, and how they basically live their lives as they ran away from home. While just now as i'm in 6th grade, my friends and I have had a lot of fun reading this book."
5,A Perfectly Perfect Book,"This is a book about a girl who plans the best runaway. She doesn't want to get to dirty, so she runs away to an art museum. She doesn't want to be lonely, so she brings her brother with. Along the way, they cross paths with a very intriguing mystery. . . ."
4,A book about two runaway kids,"I enjoyed this book because I liked to see what it was like not to have so much money. I also enjoyed it because they lived in an art museum after they had run away from home. In the museum's room they were hiding in, they were concealed from the museum guards. I especially enjoyed this book because you never knew what would happen. It was also really strange and a bit funny because there was smartalick talk in it. Claudia and Jamie were always snide to each other. I also really loved the book because it stays on one subject and doesn't go from one subject to something totally different. It was easy to follow. I totally enoyed reading it because it was a good length for subjects. These reasons are why I've really enjoyed this book."
2,Boring book,"This book is boring. A girl runs away ( I don't know why ) but she has to live in a museum and sleep on a fancy bed (because she is spoiled, I guess). So she becomes obsessed by this statue and does not want to go home. This book is prissy. I am sorry I picked this book to read for school."
1,Didn't like it at all. Newberry winner? Why?,"I didn't find the writing style or the plot very engaging. It dragged on and on, and I didn't find the conclusion very satisfying.Aside from not enjoying the story, why would I want to hand my child a book about two children that run away? The children are unrealistic and are also rude to adults and each other. They cheat and lie. Their actions have no consequences. There are so many other more engaging children's books that also have moral story lines. This one is not on our family's ""must read"" list."
3,Paper not easy to flip over,I ordered this book for my daughter. This paperback printing had papers cut in different sizes (not evenly cut) and thus not easy to flip pages and read. Felt it was a low end printing quality.
1,POOP,"I hated this book!!!!!!! It was pointless, It only incourages peoplw to run away for the sake of adventure!"
2,Only read this book if you have nothing else better to read,This is a book with a poor plot and bad ending. The whole story comes in at the last two chapters. So these two kids go to the Met what kind of story is that. Reading this book is like reading 156 pages of;fjkkdfjkjfdkjfddslkjfdjskkdgjkfgdhfhgjfgdhgddhhdfjfdjdfk jfdjkdjfjdfshjfdhdfjdfhdfjkfhdjkdfshfhds fdjkjfhsdflhbgdfj dfsjhfdhj. Did you enjoy that I did not think so. This is why you should not read this book there is no good plot. So buy this book if you want to waste money and have nothing better to read.
5,"This book is funny, well written and adventurous",This is a great book. The author seems to have a great understanding of kids and siblings. There is not one boring part. It's also very original. I've never read a story with a plot like this one. This is one of my favorite books.
4,A fasinating mystery!!!!!!!!!!,This is a book on a boy and a girl who run away to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. While there there they find a beautiful scupture named ANGEL. Its past owner was Mrs. Basil E Frankwieler. She is the only person who knows the answer to the unsolved mysery.
1,don't bother!,"sampled it on itunes. major mistake to buy the thing unless you like variety in the completely non-focused form because that is what you'll get here.it might be nice to hear the wonderful ms. orso sing actual lyrics as opposed to the vocalise we've come to associate with her due to her numerous collaborations with ennio morricone & other italian film composers. but what we end up with here as a tacky grab bag which finds edda singing virtually everything from italian opera classics to a medley of ""new york new york,"" ""summertime"" & ""cabaret"" in which she unsuccessfully tries to belt out in some sort of razzmatazz manner.if you enjoy edda dell orso, best to stick with truly good albums like ""samba para ti"" from the 60s on which she collaborates with guitarist bruno battista d'amario."
4,Not quite a masterpiece,"...but still a good read! I've always liked the works of Poe. This book was a little hard to follow and the names were a bit long but I enjoyed it. If you have any interest in Poe, you should read this book!"
3,Functional but not very water resistant,I bought this watch for my son. He loves all the gadgets. Howeverafter a week of camping in the rain the watch has condensation on theinside. It's supposed to be water resistant to 30m so this seems tobe a defect.All other functions seem to work as advertised. We still need to hikeup a mountain to test the altimeter.
3,Bad first impression,"Other than the good price, I am not impressed by this set, right out of the box. The 1-inch, which is the one I would use most, is considerably out of square. The 3/4"" is a bit out of square (still more than it should be), with an end that is also a bit scalloped. The 1/4"" has the handle twisted relative to the blade, so that it is not as natural to use.I expected to have to sharpen them (and I need to) when new, but the out of square is just unacceptable."
5,Good product,A lot less expensive than buying directly from Nokia or T Mobile. Works as intended flawlessly. Sf Planet delivered in two business days.
2,Works but...,"... I wanted to have this cable to be able to upgrade the Firmware of my phone, but somehow this does not work. It should work as of Nokia, but doesn't.... still good for a quick sync as Infrared is slower than USB."
5,victor manuelle the best,i think that victor manuelle is one of the best salsa artist his songs have great meaning to them and they are soo danceable. he is even better in concert. i would never miss him if he ever came back to houston.
5,Money back guarantee,This book literally changed the way I look at things. Ignore the movie - read this book. Then consider the fact that it was written in the early 1900's. That sound was you reading the last page and having your mind blown away.
1,No Quality Control,"I cannot review the ball itself, because I could not inflate it. The hose that came with the pump had a hole in it. This was not a hidden little leak. It was a clearly visible molding defect. It would be so simple to test the hoses before they ship them. Instead, the manufacturer wasted my time, lost my business, and possibly yours too. Why should you have to do their quality control for them?"
2,Self-involved couple make for poor reading...,"Just finished this book and was greatly disappointed. Rubin is exactly the kind of self-involved, arrogent charcter that I dread running into while hiking.Furthere, are we supposed to feel sympathy for this wife? The longest these two are apart is six weeks yet she manages to pout, faint and cry hysterically due to the ""stress"" of being seperated from her husband. Anyone who has a parent or spouse in the military, foreign service or on a mission or has been in a long distance relationship will find her inability to deal with life on her own for short periods of time tiresome and pathetic.In the meantime, Rubin dishes out just enough guilt so that we don't ""blame"" him for his spouses hysteria, yet obviously doesn't care enough about her to get off the trail.This is more a tale of a very unhealthy marriage than of a journey on a beaten path. Less melodrama and more focus on the trail itself would have helped."
4,Great guide book!,"This book is REALLY good. Though it doesn't list but 50 ideas, it's great for information on the science fair project ""process"". Her book is divided into two parts. Part I is the process on how to organize and present your project. How to research for it, how to set up your display, where to categorize your project and so forth. Part II has project ideas with details on how to do it. She basically says to choose a topic, ask yourself ""I wonder..."". Her 50 ""I wonder"" ideas are in Part II.While her ideas are good, I would've liked to have seen more variety, or a good list of ""I wonder..."" questions without all the details. Just to jump start more ideas. Like a list of 100 questions to ask yourself or something similar. The 50 ideas are great, but it needs more. A good list of questions would've made this book a 5 star.If you're looking for a guide on how to DO a project, this book is for you."
5,Sweet memories of early science teaching!,"Thanks so much Kansasdiscountbooks (Randy Hall)! I started science teaching in 1963 and the ""Electricity By The Drop"" created many an INQUIRY SESSION from then until I retired in 1992. I built mine by attaching 2 aluminum measuring cups to a sheet of plexiglass (by the handles). A bottomless plastic bottle fed a system of IV tubing plumbing with dripping water. What fun and amazed 7th - Seniors !!! Many thanks Randy for making it possible for my nephew and grandson to use this book in their science teaching, too."
1,You can do better,"There are suggestions in this book that I think are unsafe and unproven. As a dermatologist myself I think you can do much better with ""Looking good at any age"" by Amy Newburger. She is a dermatologist who really knows her business and the TRUTH about the cosmetic industry and skin care."
5,Mystery of Love is the greatest Mystery of all,This is sweet and simple in what it set out to do. Answers are attempted throughout but never finalized because love is never finalized.BIG IDEA: Love is being ultimately present with the person or thing and growing together for the sake of growth.OTHER IDEA: Education should be a 3 part process to help an individual:1) discover their uniqueness2) harness and grow their uniqueness3) share their uniquenesstill next time...Tom
5,Why don't we teach this in our schools?,"This book has been in my library for years. I have given copies for gifts many times, I wish I knew how many. The information in this book is so very important for everyone and written in such a way that it can be easily read and understood by everyone. Should be required reading in every high school and university.I have read other Buscaglia books and found them all to be well written and filled with beneficial content.Thanks for the opportunity to review a winner."
5,Dense action. Non-stop adventure. Natural aliens.,"This is a remarkable book. The first 90+ pages are non-stop action. The most continuously exciting ""opening"" of any sci-fi book I've every read! The science is solid and detailed. The good guys and alien are deep and believeable. The battle scenes are specific and real. With this one book David Weber has replaced Arthur Clarke as my favorite sci-fi author. (Sorry, Artie.) I can't wait to start his other stories."
5,"Solid, exciting adventure from the creator of ""Dahak""","I found it hard to believe that the author of the last three ""Honor Harrington"" novels could finally pry himself loose long enough to write a readable, exciting story. This one starts with a jolt of adrenalin in the first few sentences and never lets up, right up to one of the most moving endings I have ever read. I've been through this one three times, and enjoyed it every time."
4,Star rocks!,Just picked up the CD by accident. First track--the ultimate soundtrack to a seductive striptease. A really creative effort.
5,Beating to Our Own Drum!,"I bought this for my daughter in England as a surprise gift. From the moment we put it on, she loved it! Almost every day she asks for the ""Bop Book"" and I happily oblige. It's a wonderful book and CD to get your preschooler away from the t.v. and into some exercise!"
1,"Outdated, complicated projects put a damper on Donna's book.","I was very excited when I ordered this book. However, the excitment did not last for long. The projects seem to be unoriginal and so out dated that I can't imagine today's children would be entertained. Some projects also require hard to find materials. The book was a good concept but was poorly executed by the author. For fun easy to do arts and crafts for the family try one of the following books: MudWorks, Disney's Family Fun Crafts, The Ultimate Book of Kid Concoctions (my favorite) or Kids' Crazy Arts and Crafts."
2,Not True White,"Although this particular shawl was 4 times more expensive than other similar ones currently on Amazon - I ordered it for my wedding because it came in white where others came in cream or ivory. To my disapointment it was not white - but cream. I could have saved quite a bit of money ordering the ""Pashmina Cashmere Shawl / Wrap (Size 78""x28"") - 42 Vibrant Colors."" This Basile shawl also provides very little warmth as it is very thin, at one point my thumb went through the fabric. Had I planned ahead further I would have returned the item and purchased a different one."
2,Pages out of order!!!!,"While I enjoyed the contents of this book, it was very frustrating to read because the book's pages were out of order. Apparently there was a glitch of some sort in the manufacturing process. Made it an unpleasurable experience. :("
4,Gladiator GarageWorks can be a bit spendy but work well.,"I have a ton of Gladiator GarageWorks' items throughout my garage including the huge standup cabinets, 13 wall cabinets and numerous styles of hangers. It looks and works great. I definitely would recommend Gladiator items, especially when they can be found on clearance or on sale."
2,Jimi Plays Berkeley Rehash,"Right off the bat the cover isn't even a shot of Jimi At Berkeley and its all downhill after that. I have several close up slides of the second show that could have been used. Why the estate passes on their vault of Hendrix filmed material and releases this is beyond me. Bring out the Royal Albert Hall, Atlanta Pop, Stockholm 69, PLEASE. This latest release will not win too many fans. The estate has had 20 odd years to ""get it together"" and except for the box sets along with Isle of Wight and Woodstock, has failed miserably. Come on McDermott you were once a collector and fan. What Up?"
3,Very Disappointing!,"Very disappointing! There isn't much (significant) difference (for most music fans except for fanatics or collectors) to buy another copy (of Jimi Plays Berkeley), if you already have the older version that came out in DVD or even VHS. The exploitation of Jimi Hendrix and his fans continues! At the very least, I would have liked to have seen the whole Jimi Hendrix performance of ""Machine Gun"" and ""Hear My Train A'Comin'"" without the insertions or substitutions documenting the history or context, not to mention the full first and second shows of the whole Berkeley concert."
5,I have heard it all now...,"Hendrix, an overrated musician? I have heard it all now. You got to be kidding me..."
3,good not great.,"i ran away from home to see this film when it came out.i enjoyed it but,be prepared for a Jimi Hendrix short subject as it were."
2,Get ready for the worst camera man EVER.!,"The music is great, but whoever filmed this was obviously high on crack or something. Shaky camera, zooming in way to close on Jimi's face.I found myself getting very frustrated when Jimi was playing one of his cool riffs an the friggin camera man was zoomed in on amplifiers and other equipment, or was 3 inches from Jimi's face.If the cameraman would of just zoomed out a little and just left it the heck alone, it would of been a great DVD. Instead it's just a frustrating DVD to watch."
1,I'm Glad I Evaluated this Book First,"This is a very poorly written book, and I found much of it to be completely useless. I decided to check out other people's reviews on this book to see if anyone else felt the same way. I sent it back immediately."
2,Mechanic advised against use,I purchased these as parts for a new exhaust/header system but my mechanic advised against their use (due to the slots) because they can be easily misaligned at installation or become misaligned with daily use.They seem well made but I ended up using flanges with precise holes for the bolts.
3,hands free sheetrock holder,"for a retired person this does come in real handy. however, with just a bit of thought I could have made one myself."
3,Disappointing,"Having read all of the previous books in this series, I must admit that I have been one of those complaining that, in every book, Lori Shephard meets some handsome man and must fight tooth & nail against the temptation of having a fling with him. Well, that almost happens in this book, but a friendship develops instead. The problem is that the character that would normally tempt her was not fleshed out enough; in fact, that is the problem with most of the characters in this book - most are stereotypical.I also had two problems with this entry: one, Lori suspects someone of doing the mischieviousness that is impossible. Any regular reader of this series knows the person she suspects would never do anything like the crimes in the book. And two, the manner in which the culprit manages to get away with his/her 'crimes' for so long is slightly ridiculous.Not for sure if I will be picking up the next book in the series or not."
3,Aunt Dimity Takes a Nosedive,"I love Aunt Dimity and couldn't wait to read the latest. The size of the volume alone should have been a red flag. The Dimity books have never been what you would consider 'heavy reading' but all were well crafted, with memorable characters and an excellent sense of place. This is all missing. Everyone is a cardboard cutout; I never felt any one of the characters' emotions -and with the issues dealt with in this book, there should have been many strongly felt feelings. Also, pressure from Lori's critics over her flirtatiousness has won out- there is nothing more than a motherly friendship between Lori and Simon, and even that feels shallow. But the worst offense, to me, is at the end when the plump red haired maid becomes the petit gray haired maid.....I was so busy blathering ""What...??!!"" to myself that the emotional climax evaporated completely. I hope Aunt Dimity's next outing will be more substantial."
2,I Haven't Read Ever the Book Like This!,"This book was awful, but in fact it was nice too. There was too much unrealistic parts and it wasn't scary. It was nice to read, but I don't think that you should buy this one. Borrow it from a friend or from library. This is good, but definitely not so good! I give this 2 stars!"
2,Acceptable Tony Hillerman Book film,"This book, in our opinion, is not as good as the three Tony Hillerman books produced later for PBS: A Thief of Time, Coyote Waits, and Skinwalkers. All four film were produced by Robert Redford. This film has good scenery, and a good Indian story, but the later three films had better acting, better character development, better scenery, and a more intimate closeness to Indian culture and traditions. Nevertheless, because we liked the latter three films so much, we were glad to find this film. We wish Robert Redford would produce some more in the series."
4,The Dark Wind,Lou Diamond Phillips does well in this movie based on a Tony Hillerman novel. The movie pretty well follows the story. I enjoyed it.
3,Got the video,"I video played fine, no issues. Not the greatest Lou Diamond movie, but I am a fan of the genre and love Tony Hillerman. So it was worth the money."
5,BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED LEATHER BIBLE.,"I absolutely loved this bible. It's just what I wanted and needed. A bible that is Unique in style and in large print. It would make a great gift, as well."
1,"This Bible is Not Leather Bound as Described - it's ""Leather-Look""","Be careful. This Bible is not Leather Bound. It's ""leather-Look,"" kind of cheap-looking. I checked the ISBN and I received the correct item, but it's not leather, and it's not soft. I doubt it will hold up very well for very long."
5,Great Purchase!,I love having both translations side by side. I can use the Message for everyday reading and helping me grasp an idea and use the NASB for deeper study. Well worth the purchase price.
5,It's Such a Blessing!!!,"I recommend anyone that's a Christian, no matter if you are new or seasoned, to purchase this Bible! Not to say that any other Bible you choose isn't good, because all Bibles reveals God's message to us, but I found this one to be so helpful in my understanding of God's Word. The Message is a really good tool to summarize or help explain any verse that may be confusing. I read this Bible along with my NKJV Bible (the Extreme Word Bible just in case you wanted to know) everyday, and I enjoy every minute of it!! If you do purchase this Bible, I hope that it is a blessing to you as it is to me.Many Blessings to you and yours and Have a Wonderful Day! :-)"
1,disappointed,"We ordered this for Christmas. It arrived and had missing parts so it couldn't be put together. We contacted the company and they said they would ship the parts. IT IS NOW FEBRUARY 4!!! STILL NO PARTS, NO CORRESPONDENCE. I WILL NEVER DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN!"
5,drama,This is a great movie. Would recommend. It's sad to see how different religions can hurt young love and divide families. It will never change. Would buy from this seller again.
5,Great Product!,"Thisis a great product and you get a poerful steam, almost like you're in a spa. I love it, And the price is good too. Also, if you want more stam just add maybe half a teaspoon of salt and it will give you more steam.I use this while cleansing and exfoliating."
5,I love this product,"I bought this facial steamer because I was suddenly and unexplainably faced with skin ISSUES. It has helped immensely. I normally use it 2 to 3 times a week for about 20 minutes. It not only gives me the benefits of healthier skin, but I also like the idea of ... "" 20 minutes of ME time. """
4,Does give a baby skin!,"I think it works very well for what it says it's for.There is a smell at the beginning, but it does go away after a while. The smell is like any new plastic product.I steamed myself with it while watching a 40-minute show on TV, and I could feel my sweat from the steam coming down my jaw and neck. I don't really need to stay in a certain position to get the steam all over my face. And after I was done with it, my skin did feel very very soft and bouncy.It does its job well and right. Maybe I would like the cord to be a bit longer than it is?!And I do have one other thing like some other people do:In the instruction regarding how many pinches of salt, why don't they just use a standard measurement like 1/3 or 1/2 of teaspoon of salt, instead of how many pinches of salt and stresses again it's ""pinches"" not ""a lot."" That cracked me up a bit.So, yes, salt did help generate steam. (I have city water.)"
3,slightly dissapointed,"i have been looking forward to this album for monthes, and after listening to it today, i must say that i was dissapointed. many of the songs sounded similar to others on the album. and i know that bands change and evolve over time, but did it have to be such a drastic change? i miss the old switchfoot! i wish that they could have kept a little bit of their old sound around. although these are things i wish, the album has not turned me off to switchfoot entirely. i will continue to listen to this album with the sincere hope that it will grow on me over time. and i will buy the next switchfoot album, whenever that might be."
3,Makes You Want to Drink Your Sorrows Away,"Most of the songs have guitars strumming around the same volume level of the lyrics with a few songs letting them ring out without so much orchestration. Mostly, those few are the ones that I like because they have the strongest lyrics and you can hear it without needing to read along. However, the biggest problem I have with Switchfoot is there repetitive themes of pain and hopelessness. I have an extensive music collection with plenty of depressing songs in it, don't get me wrong, but I think an album needs more hope than just ""the shadow proves the sunshine"" (which is a good song but not enough to compensate for the rest of the gloomy album)."
5,"Thank you, Mr. Roughdale","It is, very simply a great, great album. Lots of cool beats and awesome rhythms. It is truly a great buy.And I agree with ""J. Roughdale"" and his statement. Switchfoot made a CD for the music... not a personal agenda."
3,...,"I agree with one of the previous reviewers complaining that the cd is Content/Copy Protected. I know I would personally never buy an album with that logo on it(new... i would buy a used copy of a CP cd). Especially since this cd is ""Content Protected"" which is much worse than your normal copy protection. (something that had been ""popular"" in Japan and has made it's way to the US)Now, When The Beautiful Letdown first released I viewed it as a pretty good album. Since then it has worn out it's welcome so I was fairly disappointed when I listened to this new cd and it sounded a lot like it. Nothing is Sound is better... though it still doesn't stand up to such great albums like The Legend of Chin and New Way To Be Human.While the *sound* is overall very similar to TBL, the songs themselves are performed a lot better. There are great little detail touches that really flesh the album out and gives it the creative touch that TBL lacked.I recommend the music on this album... just not the format."
1,Let me clarify,"I love Switchfoot, and have been a fan long before they went mainstream. I hate this disc only because of the way it's made-- neither of my computers will properly recognize the disc, and it won't let me put it on my mp3 player because of that. IT'S DRIVING ME MAD. So mad, in fact, that I almost smashed the disc to tiny, itsy bitsy little pieces.Good music though."
4,"Good sound, good lyrics","Pick up this disk, if you like Switchfoot's past work. Alt-rock, with good guitarwork and thoughtful lyrics."
5,Another Skagen,"Prompt service. Lovely watch as most Skagens are, and I already knew how to adjust the band and use the clasp since this wasn't my first. This one also inspired my husband to buy a similar Skagen watch. He's finally catching on to good Danish design."
5,Expressive and Impressive,"Carole Katchen understands the pastel artist and reflects her understanding in this book that goes from the basics of selecting and using pastels to the emotional needs of the artist. She has useful tips throughout. She has information and examples of negative painting, blending,scribbling, and stippling. There are refresher pages that emphasize the main points of each chapter. But, maybe the most important chapter is the last one, because it encourages the artist to be true to himself or herself and know that if art is done with courage, fun and dedication, it will glow with distinction."
3,Comfortable... while they lasted,"I bought these shoes about 8 or 9 months ago. They are really comfortable and look really nice. However, about a month ago I started to hear a clicking noise when I walked. Upon inspection I realized that the sole had worn through on the sides where it's supposed to give. A few weeks later I heard a swooshing sound. Apparently the airbag (the same one that makes them so comfortable) had popped and the air was swooshing out every time I stepped. All that said, they were really inexpensive as far as shoes go. So I guess 9 months isn't too bad."
5,Perfect Sugar Caddy,"I love this product. I am hoping to order another one for my office. I love the Fiesta Black! These are so classy and dress up any table. I highly recommend them. They are also made very well. Sturdy! Love, love, love, Fiesta!"
4,"Practical, Helpful & Achievable","This book couldn't have come at a better time. Just as I was embarking on a complete reorganization of my live/work space, this valuable, easy to read resource appeared, and enabled me to take a clearer look at my space challanges and how to solve them. In hindsight, I'm not sure what I would have done without it! It is chock full of the most practical suggestions, from how to deal with purging the stuff you really don't need, to cleaning up afterwards, to a number of storage tricks (many in the 'now why didn't I think of that catagory!) that have more than doubled my usable space. And there is much, much more to this book, such as tips for organizing the kitchen and bathroom and for locating important professional resources, that I haven't had need to utilize yet. This is going to be a permanent, indispensable resource!"
3,Had the potiential to be so much better!,"Overall, this book was OKAY....I liked the plot idea, but as another reader put it, the characters were somewhat shallow. I'm usually not one no nitpick, either, but, in one passage, a female snowy owl is described as being ""...smaller, slighter...."" Maybe it was just THAT particular owl, but in most cases, female raptors, owls included, are up to 25 percent larger. Anyway, maybe the second book of the series will be better, and like this one, I'll get it from the library."
4,"Not Frank Herbert, but still good","Some of the reviewers insist upon comparing Brian to his father. He isn't his father, let us leave it at that. However, the book is still good sci-fi. If you have read Frank's Dune books, you will enjoy this book because it dives back into the story that Frank didn't get to finish. If you like Sci-fi and you like the Dune universe you will like this book. There are no major perversions of the characters that Frank left us with at the end of his last book, which is nice, and the plot thickens as the book progresses. I got to a point where I couldn't put it down, but it took me a few pages to get back into the universe because it had been a couple of years since I read the last Dune book that Frank Herbert wrote. Bottom line: good sci-fi, but not Frank Herbert."
2,They shouldn't have bothered!!,"I have been excited about this book for quite some time, despite my reservations. I read the prequels and wished I hadn't bothered. I didn't even bother with the Butlerian Jihad prequels. But this I had to read because it was based on his outlines. This book was written for twelve year olds who have never even read a Dune book. I'm tired of people saying that Brian should be given a break. He is not a good writer period. I read this thing so fast because I didn't want to waste any more time than I had to ."
5,Hunters of DUNE,"Picks up clearly where Chapterhouse: DUNE left off. You felt the universe that Frank Herbert click into place, as well as the intermingling of the universi of Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson. Truly a wonderful book. I am counting down the days until the release of ""Sandworms""."
2,Disappointed,"I have been an avid fan of the Dune series since I first read Dune while I was in college about 30 years ago. I have eagerly awaited the release of each book in the series. I was totally disappointed with this installment. This book was a total bore to read and understand. Its plot line was uninteresting and I instead of enjoying it, I felt like I was reading it only out of dedication only. It has been a long time since I did homework, but reading this book seemed like I was doing it again. In the prologue the authors state that this book was written from original notes of Frank Herbert. If that is the case, then he should be glad he did not write this book himself."
3,We have to read this anyway.....,"I'm halfway through Hunters of Dune and I would recommend it (with a few caveats) to anyone who has invested time and energy reading the original books in the series. There is no doubt that Hunters of Dune reads like pulp and has none of the interior monologues or the prolonged intellectual sparring between characters that typified Frank Herbert's style, but to be fair the authors acknowledge as much in the preface - their concern is to provide closure to the story rather than to produce a Frank Herbert novel (which would be impossibly hard). On this dimension the book does admirably: the story moves quickly with little or no fat. It's actually a bit of a relief to not have to plough through pages of pretentious BS (which Frank Herbert was occasionally guilty of) waiting for the plot to advance. So the purists may complain, but everyone'll have to read this in the end if only because it's worth knowing what Frank Herbert's overall vision of the story was."
3,Nice to wear a watch for the daily use,"Very nice and light weight watch, I liked it. I wear everyday while going to office. Certainlly worthwhile for the amount I spent."
3,Slim Watch,"The style is real nice. But the battery doesn't work. It's either that, or it's short circuited. I had to spend ten dollars just to get it fixed. Right now it's working well. I think this company has to make sure the battery runs fine when it's shipped out. Otherwise, would be a great watch."
5,Love these bowls,Love these bowls - we now have 20 of them - oldest ones are 3 years old and never had a problem
1,Horrible,Rubber gets soft in dishwasher and smellsIts actually a good bowl. Just don't get the ones with rubber on the bottom
2,Bad smell,"The steel was fine, but after I peeled off the rubber protector there was this odd, sweet smell that felines avoided. Therefore, they--especially the younger one--stopped eating from the bowls."
1,My Bowls Cracked!,I bought 4 of these for my inside dogs. After 3 or 4 days of use they started to crack. We never took them outside or even put ice in them for the dogs. They just cracked! I paid alot for these at walmart - hopefully they will accept the return.
5,Great bowls for small pets,"These bowls are the perfect size for feeding my cats single-can servings of Innova. (For free feeding kibble and leaving out water, I use the 20 oz. size.) The Durapet bowls are easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher. They are unbreakable, stay put on solid-surfaces, and have no smell whatsoever. Why would anyone (as Yang reported) remove the plastic non-skid layer, anyway? My cats enjoy looking at their refection in the water bowl, and these bowls do not give them chin acne."
3,a whole lot of dead things,"Every dead thing is John Connolly's debut novel.I read his other book's first for some reason and, I liked the other books more. Every dead thing is the debut novel of Charlie {bird} Parker, the private investigator who not only know's every mob kingpin in every city in America but has gay hitmen for friend's. In this book there is more blood and death than most books written on world war two.The story line is confusing and the ending is no suprise."
3,EVERY DEAD THING,"BOOK INVOLVES 2 PLOTS. 1 PLOT IS ABOUT THE MOB AND THE OTHER PLOT INVOLVES A SERIAL KILLER. THESE STORY LINES WILL MERGE AS THE BOOK GOES ALONG. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS BOOK IS THE FACT THAT THE ALCOHOLIC COP, THE ALCOHOLIC EX-COP OR THE EX-ALCOHOLIC EX-COP ETC....HAVE BEEN DONE SO MANY TIMES BEFORE.AND MANY TIMES IT HAS BEEN DONE BETTER THAN THIS NOVEL."
1,A gory cliché,"Gangs in every city, painfully and boringly explained. Pitched warfare and lots of deaths all over the USA. Nobody else in America notices. They are only dead bodies. Girlfriend is so poorly charactirized she reads like tissue paper. She is useless in this story. Every one Bird meets is brutally killed but he doesn't seem to care. The trail of bodies he leaves behind are no big thing. He is only after ""THE TRAVELER""!! Clue in creepy music. The ending was ridiculous, the reasons for all this death and destruction was nonsense. If you must read this, don't buy it, get it from the library."
2,A most laborious read.,"I could easily just say ""ditto"" to Mr. Gonnella's review. There was some clever writing and witty dialog in the fist quarter of the book. Then it bogged down. Too many characters, too many flashbacks, too many subplots...just confusion. I did manage to read the entire book and it got slower as it came to a conclusion...just the opposite of what I look for in a thriller."
4,"Excellent, chilling read","I'll be looking for the next books from this author. I'd put him in the ranks with Michael Connelly, Sandford, and Harris (the earlier books). Connolly has some really beautiful writing in this book, a literary savor that gives dimension to a gruesome tale. Rich, atmospheric style and setting. Well drawn characters. Only 4 stars because I thought a tighter plot, with fewer characters, would have been more effective. The book could have used somewhat tighter writing in general (we don't need to visit the town house of the villain who has moved to the country plantation, however atmospheric). That's on it's own terms. Compared to the genre in general, it's a 5."
3,Too much of a good thing,"Connolly's mastery of dialogue and description is superb! This guy can really write... the main shortcoming is the plot: he throws everything but the kitchen sink into the mix (Mafia, KKK, ritual serial murder, voodoo, child molesters, Cajuns, etc., etc.). I was expecting space aliens to turn up next! After 250 pages of this your eyes sort of glaze over and you stop caring about whodunit. A good book to read if you have a quiet week at the beach with nothing to do and can keep track of the plot!"
3,A very convoluted novel,"There are moments of lyrical terror in this book, but overall I found it to be very hard to follow and to finish. Usually, with a ""thriller,"" I can't stop reading until the tale is finished, but this one, with basically two storylines that relate to one another only in the vaguest of ways, was 'way too complicated. Just as I was in the groove with one storyline, Connolly would pop another, with different characters, except for Bird Parker, a different crime, different clues, etc. etc. It made for tedious reading.Still, there is lots to like about this book: the air of menace you could cut with a knife, the sharp dialogue, and of the complex character of Charlie Bird Parker.I will certainly give John Connolly another whirl, but this one fell short for me."
2,So disappointed,This book started off well enough. Thought it would be shades of Silence of the Lambs. Nope. I ended up skimming the second half as it got so ridiculously convoluted. The author kept introducing new characters that were inconsequential. The story could have been told in 10 pages. Very disappointed. Granted this is his first book so maybe the writing has improved since this novel. I hate to give one star because I did skim to the end so I'll give it two stars.
2,Not enough to hold my attention..,"I would definately have to agree with one of the reviews already written. The opening of this thriller is superb, but after that the plot jumps around too much and there are too many characters introduced. I really couldn't get into this 'thriller' at all. By 1/4 into the book, I really didn't care who the Travelling Man was or what else he had done.If you are after brilliant thrillers, try Dennis Lehane or James Patterson ( I read 2 of their books in one sitting) while still trying to read Every Dead Thing, hoping it would get better..it didn't."
5,Awesome book,"I loved this book! I am always looking for new writers in the mystery/serial killer genre, and was just thrilled with Connolly's writing. As a long time fan of John Sandford's work, I was happy to find another writer I would put in that category. Some of the scenes were pretty gruesome and I figured out who the killer was prior to the book's ending, but these things only added to my enjoyment. I can't wait for another of Connolly's works to hit print. Excellent debut!"
4,Memorable beginning for Charlie Parker,"This book is the first in the Charlie Parker series. Chronicles Charlie's transition from drunk NYPD detective to the snarky, sober,hard nosed PI he becomes after the tragic murder of his wife and daughter. Charlie ""Bird"" Parker along with his friends, ex con Angel, assassin extraordinaire Louis, and Rachel help him hunt down The Traveling Man...the serial killer responsible for his wife and daughters murder. A great introduction to this series. A must read"
3,Entertaining,"This was not the first book of the series that i read (the first one was ""the reapers"") - so i know what level of tension will be achieved in the later books thus just giving 3 stars.sometimes the story seems to wander off, taking out some tension. the characters are strong, believable and you begin to care for them even if the story itself sometimes resembles many other in this genre.start with this one and keep in mind: it will get even better in the next books. ;-)"
4,John Connolly,"John Connolly is an incredible writer. This is his first novel and the place to start if you are going to read his work. His work is not for the squeamish, as he does not shy away from bad people doing bad things. But it is written with style, not in a crude way. Great author."
5,Works great and wonderful price!,"This is the same basic product sold by ThermoSpa for their hot tubs. It much less expensive, however, than the ThermoSpa comparable item. I've switched to Leisure Time for all my hot tub chemicals, and I'm saving a lot of money getting the same (or better) quality and quantity than I did with ThermoSpa. I'll continue using this product and have become a regular purchaser of it."
4,Runs small in size,"I ordered this in the XL size to use as a ""sleep top"" because I'm a 36E and need the shelf-bra to help keep my ""girls"" corralled at night. It's waaaay tight which gives a nice cleavage look, but I also struggle to get it on.The material is high quality. I've owned it for nine months, wear it every-other night (swap it out with another shelf-bra cami) and wash it 1-2 times a week (cold wash, line dry) and it's still like new.My only complaint is it runs small - - more like a sports cami, but if you're a 36E like me, you need way more than this level of support for sports!"
3,condition,"took a little longer to come compared to most of my other orders from amazon, but was in better condition then expected"
5,A mus buy for fusion jazz listeners!,"An innovative and dynamic work of art. Stanley combines the talents of many great jazz artists with his works to produce a sound that remains distinctive and original. I remember first purchasing this in the early 70s along with Return to Forever, Miles, Coltrane and others of his skill. The difference is the bridges and sequels within the melody. Truly amazing."
3,SmartCord,This is a quick and easy way to hard wire your Escort to keep wires hidden. The only thing you need to know is which wire to attach the clamp to in order to allow the detector to turn off when the car is off.
4,"Good item, difficult to install.","Though a ""must have"" for Passport Escort users, it is somewhat difficult to install by yourself."
5,Excellent addition to the Passport.,Works perfectly. Glad I bought it. For the best installation I recommend professsional installation. Mine is adjacent to my shifter & is super-convenient to use this way. It looks almost as if it's original equipment.
3,"One big flaw, but it works well","This items Achilles heel is the mount in which you use to attach it to your car's interior. It comes with Velcro which not only looks very cheap and unsightly, but I have already had it peel off once. What would have been nice was some sort of hard-mount option. Maybe I'll try to take it apart and see if I can attach it with a screw - still not my first choice. Escort should have thought ahead and included a clip or some other fastener for this purpose. Other than that, it works well considering it's nothing more than a mute switch and a hard-wire for your detector."
4,great for office wear,"This one is similar to its namesake,but softer and gentler.The violet notes are there but subtle. Good for daytime and office wear."
4,Nice but Small,"The label says Adult Standard, but it comes way short of that. The jacket fit my eldest son, who is a scant 115 pounds (at 5'10"") - needless to say he's narrow and thin. Didn't fit my husband, who it was intended for. He ended up using what he could and finding substitutes for the rest. BEST: the jacket was very stylish for a costume, detailed. Too bad it didn't fit. WORST: the blouse/shirt which was not much more than a napkin. If you can fit it, then it's a great costume. Just be wary of the size."
2,"Not a Great Book, but a start.","I am going to make this simple, but let me start by saying that I have a Business Degree in Finance, and I have an extensive knowledge in Money Management.IF YOU HAVE NO MONEY MANAGEMENT UNDERSTANDING: Read Below.If you have NO knowledge of money management, and it seems that you are always living paycheck to paycheck. PLEASE read this book or any personal finance book. Also if you haven't already, purchase ""Quicken 2007 Deluxe"" it will help identify where you're money is going each month, and assist you in planning for your future.IF YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF PERSONAL FINANCE: Read Below.Now if you have a base knowledge of financial management, and/or you are already using Quicken or another finance program, you are already on the right track. DON'T waste your time on this book; read something else, anything else.Hope this helps everyone."
5,Tactical and Practical,"As an Estate Planner with a well-established practice in San Francisco, I found Jean Chatzky's book to be enlightening. It is indeed ""tactical and practical"" and the perfect antidote for many of the folks I counsel. So many people are convinced money is the answer to all their ills. Far too many clients think they should over-insure for the wellfare of their children, as if money is a panacea.It's not what you have, it's what you do with it. I'll be buying copies for all my new clients.Well done, Jean!"
2,Not impressed.,"If you have the Beyond the Lighted Stage volume, you don't need this one. The format is the same, people talking about how great they are, themselves talking about the other two, etc... Not a lot of original footage of them actually working on those projects back in the day. Rush always kept the fans excited because they don't flood the market with themselves like DT does. I take this as a positive approach. This release is borderline flood. It's nice to see the band members in a documentary after a year or two of not hearing from them. It keeps things fresh when they come around."
2,"NO Mention of Camera Eye, Witch Hunt, Vital Signs, Tears...","NO Mention of Camera Eye, Witch Hunt, Vital Signs or Tears. WHAT???????Over 50 minutes of BONUS features and no mention of these great songs?? Why would the director not ask them to discuss these songs for at least 30 seconds?? Plus most of the time you see the trio jam it is to dubbed songs and not live. The Metallica and Pink Floyd Classic Albums shows band members playing LIVE but not here.I would have given this a one star review save for seeing Neil do a GREAT drum warm up on one of the bonus features.Buy ""Beyond The Lighted Stage"" instead. You learn about as much."
4,Good bag - but had to wash it a few times,"The bag is good but we had to wash it a half dozen times to get the shipping fumigant odor out of it. Otherwise, it is just what I wanted. It washed pretty easily alone, and I used a couple of bottles of hydrogent peroxide with baking soda, using scent-free detergent. Used a fan to dry it. The 10mm foam is thick enough. The 20mm would have been too thick to wash and dry."
5,Good guitar bag!,"Ordered this for my Jasmine by Takamine S34C NEX guitar and it fits it perfectly. The padding is decent, so no complaints here. The price was pretty on point. I like having the zipper compartment on the outside to store accessories. Perhaps a few built in slots would be nice, but seriously... no complaints!"
1,Aristocats,"I did not view this dvd immediately because I was waiting for a visit from my granddaughter. However, when I did attempt to watch it, it does not play. As a matter of fact, it has a problem loading. There is no action whatsoever. I would appreciate, very much, information regarding a replacement.Thank you for any help in this matter.Kathy Longdigitfrontrange@yahoo.com"
3,Cute but annoying,"My 2 year old daughter likes this movie and does watch it occasionally. The story is similar to that of ""Lady and the Tramp"", but where I can watch Tramp and Lady singing and romping around over and over and over again, I find duchess and her kittens all a little too sweet. The songs are OK, but they get annoying after a while. There are better movies out there."
5,The Aristocats..,This is a awesome movie. this is another great classic from disney. this is a great movie. i love disney films espicially the old ones. this is a great movie for the whole family. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
4,It's like the feline version of Lady and the Tramp!,"Another Collector's clasic to own.Wonderful, lots of action, adventures and love.beautiful animation and music. very funny too"
4,A Walt Disney Masterpiece The Aristocats,"The Aristocars is Disney's 20th full-length animated masterpiece.I saw this movie when I was 5 & liked it,but its never been my favorate.My favorates were from 1987-1996.But its still a great film for the family & I recommend this d.v.d."
3,"Gives Disney a bad name, which Disney isn't acostumed to","Baloo was such a huge Disney character, so taking Baloo's voice (Phil Harris) and putting it in the alley cat O'malley doesn't work; unless you've never seen ""The Jungle Book"". Dutchess, voiced by Gza Gza Gabor, is such a dull character; and as cute as the three kittens are, they come nowhere near to saving this movie. The plot has nothing to keep the audience interested. It's been said before: A butler who has given his service for so many years, gets passed up in the will for a familly of Aristocats. Never has a Disney movie made you feel so sorry for the bad guy. This film just doesn't work, and I'm glad I didn't buy it. However I gave it three stars because it is a child's film, and I must look from a child's perspective."
5,Very Goood.,"This VHS tape came in my mail perfectly, the movie came brand new and i was really excited! I would totally recommend this!"
1,Yikes!,"This is one of Disney's worst, almost as bad and annoying as Peter Pan. Don't get me wrong - I love Disney. But this is just awful. Slow storytelling, extraneous and unimportant scenes that add nothing...The main characters aren't bad, but many of them are just excuses to add a few more excruciatingly painful minutes onto the film. Whoever approved the release of this film in 1970 was obviously still suffering the effects of a rotten acid trip. Now I know why everyone warned me not to waste my money buying this one! Guess my faith in Disney's usual excellence and quality was ill-founded in this case. Wait for it on TV, but don't go and buy it unless you really like it. Otherwise, stick with Bambi or The Lion King if you want a great Disney critter movie."
2,Roller Coaster,"This book is a hard one to review. I loved reading the first 90% of it. The problem arose in that I was pretty sure about a third in that I knew who-done-it and was reading just because it was a very well crafted story with great character development. The problem was the end started feeling more and more rushed to me, and when I finally got there, felt it was a let-down for such a great build-up.Not a bad read, but I wouldn't rush out for it."
1,Didnt work,We tried to set the time when we received it and the hands started moving independently of each other. Returned the damn thing.
2,Worst NWA album,"I didn't like this EP album when it came out. It seems so slapped together. Straight Outta Compton and N---for Life are better albums than this hacked up effort. Dr. Dre's production is lousy here compared to his more superior efforts. They even attacked former member Ice Cube in their lyrics! How cold! MC Ren doesn't have his best lyrics and Eazy-E's sex-driven lines are overblown here. Only Just Don't Bite It is the best song here. The rest of the album is disjointed garbage! And compared to Ice Cube's solid 1990 debut album, this NWA album was weak. Cube outdid them at their own game that year."
2,100 Miles And Runnin,"NWA's first effort without Ice Cube set out to prove that the group was going to survive without its best rapper. While successful at this task, the group really comes with nothing new on this 4 song EP. Besides the title track, the only standout is Sa Prize Part 2 which is actually a sequel to F*** The Police. Unless you find this one very cheap, there really isn't enough material to make it worth purchasing."
4,Controlling the 1990's,"This EP brings back some good memories. Though clearly missing Ice Cube, Dre and co. were able to come up with some decent stuff. A good collectors item for old-schoolers."
1,Don't try to replace their watch bands,"I had the unfortunate experience of trying to replace a black leather band of my Skagen watch. I found no one in the SF Bay Area that could do so. I was directed to the Skagen Service and Repair department in Reno, NV. I placed my order ($30+) and never heard back from them. After countless telephone calls, I finally received a generic letter stating that the band was out of stock and might have to wait 90 days for its replacement. I was reluctant, but had no other choice to report them to the BBB. Within 3 days my replacement band was received! Furthermore, this watch was not from Denmark, but manufactured in China!"
3,Skagen Men's Black Titanium Watch,"About a month ago, I purchased this watch from Amazon way below cost...and I know why:The black stainless mesh band is already fading,the hardened crystal is already scratched,and the knob to adjust the date does not work.Other than that, the watch looks great!"
2,Looks cheap,"I got this Skagen online thinking that it looked like a nice, expensive watch as a reasonable price (as the reviews also pointed out). I was disappointed after receiving the watch however, as the mesh band looks like a cheap nylon band, even relatively close up. Although I like the idea of a smaller watch, the face looked very small on my wrist especially with the wide mesh band. I returned this watch for a refund and learned that you have to try before you buy."
2,It's ok.,"If you already own the Who's albums you don't need this set, most of the extra meterial is worthless talking, noises or nothing worth paying the asking price for."
5,best WHO starter kit,"This DVD is the best 2 1/2 hours of WHO tunes and interviews out there.Where the DVD ""Amazing Journey:The story of the Who"" failed by not showing the complete songs, this one does it right!Great song list, great footage, short interview clips inbetween songs, cant be beat!The second DVD in the box is said to be a ""limited edition"" and features the complete 1981 show in Germany with Kenny Jones on Drums, buy your copy now before they delete the second DVD.If you're a Who fan and just starting your collection, this one rocks and is probably the best!If you have all the DVD's already, this one has a few duplicates in it from previous DVD's, but still a gem!"
3,A Quick One While the Producer Was Away (apparently),"I own the laserdisc version and eagerly anticipated the DVD release. I am sad to say that it falls far below the standards we've come to expect from ""fully loaded"" DVDs. The video quality and sound, even given the quality of the original source masters, is far below what can be achieved with a proper remastering job. For a comparison with what COULD be achieved from an old Rock 'N' Roll movie, rent or buy the Criterion Collection's DVD release of ""Gimme Shelter""; it'll blow you away. Furthermore, although the packaging promises an ""eight-page booklet"", it is nowhere to be found. I'm glad I have the ""Thirty Years"" CD box set which came with very thorough and beautifully written reference material. That said, this collection of Moon-era (and dispensible Kenny Jones-era) live performances are sure to make wish you were: a) alive in the mid-seventies, and 2) at a Who concert. They were THAT good!"
1,Not quite what I expected,"I previously had a Motorola v300 for 2 years and unfortunately, the speaker went on it. So, I ordered this phone through T-Mobile. I only paid $50 for it which wasn't too bad.The only pro for this phone is the sleek design. It's very lightweight and so small.Otherwise, the phone is very primitive compared to my old phone. The menus are difficult to navigate through and the sound quality is terrible. It sounds like everyone is talking to you through a tin can. People have also told me that I sound like I'm very far away while talking to them. Isn't a phone's primary purpose just that? To be a phone? I was very disappointed and returned the phone a few days after I got it. I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend this phone to anyone."
4,A must for anybody wanting to learn the art of eyebrow design!,"I am a licensed esthetician & certified make up artist and always believe in expanding my knowledge in this field. This book is written in text book fashion, it really teaches the technician how to consult, correct, design & enhance their clients brows. The only thing is I wish was that they had more examples & images in color. It is a great book, as I said a great teaching tool."
4,Best Book on Delivering Streaming Audio on the Web!,"This is the best book on delivering audio over the Internet. The book reviews the three main system components required for streaming audio (encoder, server, and player) and discusses how they interact. The authors do an outstanding job of discussing the trade-offs of various streaming formats. Of particular value to anyone who wants to set-up their own Internet Radio station, it provides an excellent step-by-step walkthrough of configuring the software for three of the most popular audio streaming formats. It includes a CD-ROM with many audio examples, sound related software, and links to additional information. One word of warning -- the book was poorly edited and the editing errors are distracting at times (this cost the book a five star rating). Despite this, if you're thinking of establishing your own Internet Radio station, this is THE book to have!"
5,The best harmony ever!,"You really can't beat the Mills Brothers for harmony. They don't need much instrumental backup, but this disc has great arrangements where the instruments augment, rather than cover, the superb voices. They are like additional brothers. In the incomparable ""Glow Worm,"" the brothers show why they sold a million records--a much greater accomplishment then than now."
5,Five stars!,"On the basis of the two previous reviews, I ordered two sets (a total of four chairs) that arrived a day early. They are precisely what I wanted - non-rusting patio furniture that's *comfortable.* A high-end spa used similar chairs on their balconies and I've been looking for the last 1 1/2 years to duplicate the experience. As a matter of fact, I'm so pleased that I'm going to order an additional 2 chairs!"
4,"La Cie...good, but warranty is limited",We have over 20 LaCie drives and generally are pretty pleased with them. We've had 2 of the large capacity drives (ones that have 2 drives stripped together in a long case) go south on us in 2 years. Then we've had two also with connectors (power and firewire) get so loose they needed to be replaced.In all cases the 1 year warranty was out and therefore repair would have cost about as much as a new drive today. So out of 20 La Cie's we've had a 20% problem after 2 years. Beware of repeatedly pulling and inserting plugs in the back of these...after a while they will eventually work loose. I would also recommend not going for the stripped drives but stick with the smaller ones.
4,Decent Hard Drive - Last 2 Years,I have had this product for just 2 years and today it died. It has worked perfectly well with my Mac. I would only wish that the manufacturer could let the user replace the drive or replace the drive for us for a nominal fee.
4,good ideas and easy reading,"Rebecca Blank is an authority on what she is writing about. Further, her ideas are very good ones, similar to what other experts are saying. In addition, she is a very good writer and generally easy reading--no confusing statistics and graphs. Even though this is not a very recent book, it should be read by anyone interested in poverty in this country."
5,big hands? this is the grip,"total control for the guy with big hands. It is a large grip, so be aware. However, it is exactly what I was looking for."
2,Day Off the Dead Review,"Day Off the Dead is a collection of CGI animated clips and NOT a linear narrative. This is also NOT a stop-motion animation, contrary to how it was listed...maybe they'll change it after this review. Caveat emptor."
4,Delphi XM Signal Repeater,"It works as advertised. I would buy it again for the price paid. The unit I received did seem to have a slight problem at first, until I slid the slide switch back and forth several times -- then it worked OK."
3,Works,This product works for what I need it for But the XM company should have had a note on the box that you need to face the antenna to the South.
4,Nice product,This product does what it says - we were able to put our XM tuner in a more convenient location and keep the antennae near a south facing window. The product works as well as the signal you can get. When we sometimes lose a signal I think it has more to do with the antennae. I'd get this product again.
2,Worked as long as I never moved (!),"The best thing about this item for me was that it was ridiculously easy to set up. Really, there was almost no set up it's so simple. Negatives include the high cost. Further, the signal I got was no better than with the XM antenna included with my unit no matter where the Delphi antenna was placed. Worst of all, it only worked for me if I didn't move. Sounds bizarre I'm sure, but this got a decent signal if I sat in my family room and never moved. Soon as I stood up and started walking around, even into a room 20' away, the signal dropped out and became intermittent. Maybe metal in my body from past surgeries was affecting signal (?) In any case, a total disappointment in my home and glad good ole Amazon has a great return policy."
1,Tube does not fit my Whisper 20 model.,In the description it says that the tube will also fit 10-20 Whisper models. All LIES because it didn't fit at all! I was so happy because I looked everywhere and couldn't find this extension tube. When I saw it online I decided to spend the extra money to have it. Now I have a worthless $8.00 piece of plastic. Save your money if you don't have a 30 model!
4,Fun,"What a great movie! Sure, the production values are a bit lacking, but it's an indie. The story reminds some of us how silly adolescence was, and it's especially nostalgiac for anyone who has had a crush on a straight guy. The songs are very well sung, as well."
1,been there and done that....,"not interesting, not original, and certainly not entertaining unless you've been under a rock for the Last 25 years.Fame is much better and still a timeless story of Dancing, love and life.The Gay angle is weak and not done well at all. It's like an 11 year old gay male wrote it with his confused girl friend, mixed up and not interesting.Try again Kids!"
2,mMm... sucky,Great singing... Horrible acting... Weak story... I expected alot more because of all the reviews on the cover... Horribly disappointed... But hey... they can sing...
3,"Good for basic repairs, but not specific enough for me","Covers the basics well. Great for learning oil changes, and belt replacements. Overall, a good book if you never plan on modifying your car. However, if you want info on how to remove certian pieces of your car, if you want info on specific stuff, you won't find it here. A good basic manual, though."
3,It's okay but not great,"It's a detent starters, but if you know how to search on the web, you can find the Helms manual which is much better. The big flaw of Haynes is that if you don't know where to search for a part, the close-up won't help you locate it.It also won't help you troubleshoot soemthing. For that join a forum or club, and use the book as a reference to do the repair once troubleshooting is done.I used it for electrical and for such it's fine..."
2,low quality,"We actually bought this at a Children's Museum over a year ago. They had one on display and it looked to be great quality. We brought it home and quickly realized that the wheels are always coming misaligned. Every time we think we've figured out a way to keep them pointing straight, we are soon disappointed. The piece of fabric that attaches to the ""seat"" portion is so flimsy that not even a very small toy can sit there. The metal portion of the ""seat"" always comes undone, we were able to re-attach it the first 806 times, but somehow now neither myself nor my husband can get it re-attached in a way where the seat will stay propped open. Overall we are very disappointed. We bought it hoping for extra good quality, and instead it is very poor quality."
4,"Nice watch, but frustrated buying","I have ordered this watch and it will take 10 days to receive the watch. Once i open the package, they have send a womens watch. I emailed the customer service and they reordered the watch. Watch is very nice and having great look, but getting this item really frustrates me."
4,A Great All Weather Dog Boot,"We recently purchased a set of these from a local store only because our girl Blue needed them immediately. I'm not sure what all the negative reviews are about because Blue really likes them and we find them to be extra useful. Our street was recently resurfaced with gravel and Blue's paws were destroyed. These Muttluks did a fantastic job of protecting her feet and Blue did not mind them at all. They do need to be adjusted quite tightly at the start of her walk, but after that she can walk normally. Putting them on is not any harder than putting on her socks after treating her paws with Snout Soother. We have her stand up in between our legs and grab her paw, making sure to get all the pads in the boot, pull the boot up. The only thing we would change is to add another strap of velcro."
4,Great for urban dogs!,"After this terrible winter there has been so much salt and sand on the roads that my dog's feet were getting torn up--not to mention they were bringing all that muck into the house. I had been researching dog boots for some time and was a little leery of the leather bottoms on these--but for my dogs they are great! In general they stay on (though occasionally they fall off if I don't get them on properly)and the dogs don't mind wearing them. They do stay on in deeper snow which is great too. I took them out the other day in the middle of a rainstorm and their feet stayed dry and clean (yay for no muddy footprints!!).They protect their paws from all kinds of nasty things on the road and the younger dog likes them so much that when we put them on her, she starts to zoom everywhere. I think they make their feet feel pretty darn good. Overall very happy with this product!"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Its all 2-D extremely basic with pretty much no cool features. Save your money. Most good engineering programs cost much more, but are 15 times better. You're better off with an etch-a-sketch."
3,"A good, solid, interesting read","This book by Dee Henderson is a solid read. The main characters are enjoyable even though one of them of flawed and has some real problems. It is interesting how she weaves one character to get to know the other character which can be dangerous for her. As usual, after protracted problems and two main characters are able to get together. A good read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
1,Horrible,"This book was terrible! Characters I don't care about, unrealistic and horribly written plot, and the non stop preaching was unappreciated. This book is really Christian propaganda masqueraded as a thriller romance. If I wanted to read Bible passages I would have read...well the Bible."
1,Awful!,"This book was just awful! The only positive thing I can write about this book is that it was free for Kindle. First, it really should have been made more clear that this would be a VERY Christian-themed book. Not cool Amazon.As for the book itself - I can honestly say that it is one of the worst I have ever read. It is completely superficial and unrealistic. I actually hoped for main characters to be killed, just for something actually interesting to happen.And Adam - stalking is neither romantic nor heroic. You fail at life. I really wanted you to be shot."
4,Interesting story unfolds,"Dee Henderson is my favorite Christian author, and this is just the start of the series. This was my second read of this book, not something I do often. As always, the characters are strong and interesting. Sara has a story that keeps her out of the public eye, or anybody's eye for that matter. Due to events that happened as a child and continue to haunt her in adulthood, she lives a life sheltered from exposure to all people around her.At times, the time seems to rush ahead, not always seeming to connect. The actions of both Sara and Adam tend to make me question (or at least get aggravated with) the motivations for what they are doing. The other concern was the intensity that the antagonist focuses on Sara. It seems a bit over the top at times. Despite this, Dee Henderson still delivers the suspense that will keep your rooting for the couple throughout the book."
3,Book: Danger in the Shadows,"Good plot and interesting characters however overly wealthy. O'Malley must be a woman to fill so many pages with food and apparal also so much conversation had added nothing to the plot. I did appreciate the lack of obscenity, something so many writers are obsessed with. All writers have a problem of pedantry, so many pages of useless information. Publishers do want 250 pages. The book cam be entrtaining by skimming through the food and clothes pages.Lynn in Jacksonville OR"
5,Loved it! Great read!,Awesome book! It held my interest and I couldn't stop reading it! There was a good blend of suspense and romance! Perfect!
4,great series,"Although this was not my favorite out of the O'Malley series, it was a great book. It had suspense, but was not as intense as some of her others."
5,Suspenseful and spectacular,"I have never been disappointed by any books Dee Henderson has written, this book is no exception. It is a fast paced book based on murder and kidnapping and living in the aftermath. It is also a sweet love story and amazing love and support of a brother. I highly recommend this book!!"
3,Love Dee Hendersen but was a little disappointed,"The story is a good one. You will be captivated in the beginning of the book but after awhile it d r a g s o u t about Sara and her pain. I think explaining her pain and what she has to live out is important but I think it seemed to just fill in pages to make the story longer. Maybe it there were more flashbacks to things that happened as she grew up and how it affected her would have been more intriguing.I read all the O'Malley books and True Honor, True Courage and love them all."
2,The Shaddows are weak,"Hey the book was free, so I shouldn't complain. The writing quality was marginal. All the spiritual references were a bit over the top for me and I found it somewhat predictable. Good reading for Jr. High and HS age girls."
1,Couldn't Even Finish This One,"I tried. I really tried. But the lack of suspense, and the lack of character and plot development made this read less interesting than watching paint dry. I didn't pay for the Kindle version but I wasted my time hoping that, by halfway into the book, something would happen...a little heart-pumping suspense, a little heart-throbbing romance? But, alas, nothing more than prayers and bible verses and a little platonic cuddling. Yikes!I agree with the reviewers who wish to be alerted when a book falls into the category of Christian fiction. This is my first foray into that genre--and my last (if I can help it)."
5,Speechless!,I love to read mystery/romance and have often wondered if there was a book or books out there that were exceptionally written without foul language and sex. Here is one!! I didn't want to put it down. Danger in the Shadows kept me spellbound from page one with suspense. Particularly refreshing was the way the characters depended on God for strength and guidance. The scripture references provided the source for their faith and helped the reader understand the character's feelings and thoughts.
4,romance meets suspense,"so like dis story was kinda cool an dis iz coming from an advanced 12-yr old`s point of view.(by da way, im not like bad at english or anything but dis iz how i text so dis iz how i roll) will fate allow sara and adam 2 b together or is their luv simply not meant 2 b? read dis book an u`ll find out"
5,THE OTHER SIDE AND BACK: A PSYCHIC'S GUIDE TO OUR WORLD AND,"""THE OTHER SIDE AND BACK"" HAS BEEN A REVELATION FOR ME. EVERY SINCE CHILDHOOD,I KNEW THERE WAS AN ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER. AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I ALWAYS TOLD EVERYONE.I NOW KNOW IT'S MY SPIRIT GUIDE.THIS BOOK HAS ENHANCED MY BELIEFS IN THE HEREAFTER.I HAVE ALWAY KNOWN THAT I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE. SINCE READING THE BOOK I KNOW MY SPIRIT GUIDES NAME.I HAVE CONFIRMED MY LIFE THEMES.NEXT I WILL VISIT THE OTHER SIDE. THIS IS THE KIND OF BOOK THAT YOU READ OVER AND OVER.""SYLVIA BROWN"" TELLS IT ALL LIKE IT IS. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE READ BY ALL."
4,Excellent for believers,"Sylvia does give great advice, no doubt. And she does seem to know what she's talking about. But to me, she looses a little credibility when I hear she charges [$$$] per question to ask her Spirit Guide Francine something. I know she has to make a living too, but if she's really here to help people she wouldn't charge exorbitant fees for a reading.However, I am happy she exposes the tricks of true frauds and their techniques. She is so correct on the silliness of voodoo and curses, and how they do not exist.I hope with all my heart she's the real deal. I would love for everything she says to be true, but in the back of my mind I'll never really know for sure. When I see her on TV talking to someone about there dead loved one, she'll describe them as ""beautiful eyes, sharp features, oval shaped face, and a sweet smile"". That could be ANYONE. EVERYONE thinks their loved one is a beautiful person.In any case, it's a good book. I recommend it, see what you think."
4,Fascinating account of psychic power,"""The Other Side and Back"" is great. I've always found it darkly fascinating to discover how death and the meaning of life are interpreted in books. War novels like ""The Triumph and the Glory"" deal with death in a certain manner, such as presenting the value of life as something given up in sacrifice for a greater good. Thrillers use death as a plot device to sensationalize, while murder mysteries use it as the necessary precurser to solving the crime. Psychic books like ""The Other Side and Back"" approach the topic from another direction, exploring it in depth and presenting a theory to explain the meaning of life and other great mysteries of our existence. I love to compare the approaches! Get a copy of this one, it is very intriguing."
2,poorly written,"I personally thought Sylvia's first book ""Adventures of a psychic"" was far better written than her newest book. I was disappointed that this book didn't truly reflect the title's theme. Very little was written on angels and spirit guides, and only 1 page for tapping your psychic powers. I found it had more commonsensical advice which anyone could find in one of the ""Chicken soup for the soul"" books. In comparison to other authors and psychics such as George Edward and George Anderson, I believe their books are a better reflection of the other side. I consider myself a fan of Sylvia Browne's and I will continue to read her books, I just hope the next one is more reflective of the title."
2,Repetition,"This books seems to be a collection of smaller works all mashed together. Many sections are simply bullet point after bullet point. The name is misguided. A better title would be Sustainability ventures of business, government, and policy makers."

2,"Too much toplology, not enough user setup","Sorry Guys (Melissa & co.)...After pushing through this one cover to cover and then attempting a big project I felt rather let down.The book went to great lengths to discuss planning and network toplologies, as well as many repetetive discussions about the benefits of ICA protocols over RDP, not to mention endless pages explaining the difference between NetBIOS, IPX/SPX, TCP/IP etcetera.Many chapters repeated material already covered and while I did glean some insights into licensing and the diferences between Terminal Server and MetaFrame this was not the information you ultimately need when it comes to deploying the product.The main areas that are left out are user profile configurations, roaming profiles, group policies and application customisations and installations.Probably a good book for sales people who want to know what the product can do - but who don't have to actually make it do it.Only two stars from me.Svend Petersen,Sydney,Australia."
2,Skagen 430SSXD,The watch was purchased and given as a gift to a person that lives abroad. After 2 weeks of use the batery was dead. The person intalled a new batery and it worked fine.
4,"Beautiful Watch, Great Value!","This watch is HALF the price it sells for in the stores! It is very smooth to the touch, thin and a classy look. I love silver toned jewelry, so this is a great addition to my collection. The shipping time was also very impressive. My only issue is with the band. I have a very small wrist, so I expected to have links taken out. Once I had that done, the watch was too small. I had a link added back and now it's too big. I need to wear it further up my arm. Also, the trifold metal clasp is not curved enough to easily wrap around the wrist. The watch doesn't go in a smooth circle once fastened. (TIP: be sure your jeweler gives you the pins back along with the removed links for future use)"
3,Okay - Three Stars,"One of the best SVU thrillers I have read, although the ending was kind of disappointing."
4,Men's bracelet-surgical steel cable,Great shipping and communication from seller. Item is very elegant and unique. Makes a statement as I have had a lot of questions about it. Brings up a many conversations from people I would like to get to know better.
5,Peggy Holroyd's Insight into Indian music,Peggy Holroyde has deep insights into the soul of Hindustani Classical Music of North India.Her book provides an easy read for both the Indian and Western readers interested ingetting a flavor of Indian music as lay people.
1,avid walker-6 miles + per day,These boots are not for those who actually walk any distance. Two boots had holes in them with less than 40 miles walked. I walk on sidewalks and streets and wanted something to keep the salt from my dogs feet. Thsi is a poor choice to accomplish that.
5,Beautiful color,"My hair is silky smooth,the color very radiant.Oh, I love it so MUCH!!!Next time I will buy 3 tubes instead of two. My hair is long and thick, past my shoulders now.So I would recommend you should buy three.And I highly recommend this to everyone who wants beautiful, vibrant red hair!"
5,Great idea for a gift book!,"In publishing's new world of gift book gifting, STICK TO BUSH makes a great gift for the political season. Funny, witty bumperstickers, just a dollar each, if you total it up. A wonderfully designed and accomplished little non book with great potential to stir things up."
2,The point of a keychain without the front?!,"I got this keychain and after not even a month hanging on my schoolbag, the front emblem piece fell off! I never found the front part else I could have superglued it back on. I was very disappointed at the quality of what is a rather nice looking keychain."
2,not so great shipping,The shipping on this product was lacking. The price was steep and the way it was recieved was poor. When my package arrived it was in a box 4 sizes to big for the item with no protection arround the key chain. It was literally thrown in a box and shipped. Not what I expected for the money I paid.
5,Nice bag for mirrorless camera,"I was stuffing my Olympus OM-D into a small Case Logic bag that I previously used for the Panasonic GF1, and I wanted something a little more roomy. All the larger bags I have are Crumplers, which have a lot of padding, and for a small camera a lighter bag seemed more suitable. Domke was not a brand I had tried, but they seem well liked, mostly for their quality and minimal padding. The bag has worked out well for me, and the minimal padding is very adequate. (I noticed they also make this bag in a nylon version instead of their traditional canvas.)"
3,Wonderbrella,The umbrella is much to expensive for the quality. It is not very sturdy. The only benifit is the plastic covering. I would purchase one again but not for this price.
1,I Would Rather Swallow Fishing Hooks Than Read This Book Again,"This book absolutely sucked. The plot was poorly conceived and the characters were horrible. I would rather swallow a bunch of fishing hooks than read this awful book again. After I began reading this book I started to close it immediately, but then I figured I'd give it a chance. After I wasted my precious time reading these whole pasted pages of scrabble called a book, I literally set it a blaze. I walked down by the river with my gasoline canister and dropped a match on it. Please do not read this terrible book unless you are desperately searching for death. Simply speaking, I hated it!"
1,Rubbish,"Just garbage. Poor plot amateur writing skills; a 50 year old man writing a fantasy. I can't say how sorry I was to have paid to read this, and embarrassed to say I finished it."
3,Escort/Beltronics Power Cord,"There is nothing wrong with this product. However, this connector is identical to a standard phone connector. You could save a lot of money by using a old/cheap phone cord with only a very small amount of electrical proficiency required."
5,Great Watch,Great Watch. Easy to read. Comfortable band. Keeps perfect time. Great looking. Love it. Very glad I bought this watch.
2,"Glass scratch prone, strap breakable, battery difficult to change","Minor injury will scratch the ""crystal glass"". Band is prone to breakage without unusual use. I agree with difficulty in changing battery."
2,Not water resistant,"I purchased this watch about a year ago after losing my first Skagen watch that I really liked. My watch is only exposed to water when I wash my hands...I always remove it to shower or swim, but somehow water penetrated the watch and tiny droplets were visible inside against the glass. After disappering a couple of days later, I though my watch was fine, but now I'm noticing that it isn't keeping accurate time. It has slowed 10 minutes and I'm sure it isn't the battery. Nice looking watch but obviously not water resistant."
5,Sleek..,Love my new watch! It is very thin and comfortable. I get compliments every time I wear it..
2,Nice Watch - Poorly designed watch Band,"Very nice design and stylish. Long battery life. Band is very stylish but does have a tendency to fall apart and become sharp - and catch on shirts, etc. Band is not under warranty."
3,"Attractive and comfortable watch, but clasp is a hassle","This watch is modern and pretty without being flashy. The face is simple and elegant, and the mesh band is innovative and unique. It's also much more comfortable to wear than most watch bands because it's breathable (with holes) and has some elasticity that most watch bands lack. Unfortunately, the clasp is a big hassle to adjust. Even when following the included instructions, the clasp is much too difficult to get into the little indentations of the mesh band. If taking the watch on and off wasn't so time-consuming and frustrating, this just may have been the perfect watch :("
4,"A compelling, mythic evocation of the desert and the person","This book *is* about the Great Sonoran Desert. If you're a ""desert rat"" who loves the place, and can't explain to your friends why - or if you're the mystified friend of a desert rat - this book may give you the vision. Though it stumbles just a little at one point, trying to integrate one too many mythoi, the promises of the beginning are delivered in the end: the myths are intact yet uncaptive, and the people are much more-seeing and a bit wiser."
3,Great product when I got it to work,"The watch is great. It looks great and it is really light weight compaired to my Fossil watches. This is my first Skagen watch and I have already gotten a few compliments about it and I have only worn it a few times. My only complaint is that it didnt work when it came to my house!!!! I had to go spend 10$ to get a new battery!. I fell like i should get 10$ off my bill, but can't get everything offline to come to your house perfect."
3,"Nice an thin, but will randomly stop working for a bit (until tapped)","I like the way the watch looks, and it is really light and thin, which is great for my relatively thin wrist.Problem: on random occasions the watch stops working... this has already happened twice in 3 weeks, and I cannot figure out why it happens. Usually it works again after tapping on it. Maybe I slightly dislodge the screw? (can't see any change). It's a shame, because otherwise I really like it."
4,"Great watch, great price",I got this watch for my dad and he really likes it. It is $100 at department stores and I got it here on Amazon for only $55 and that included tax and shipping.The only problem I had was that the box it came in looked a little dirty and used.
2,Cheap Chinese watch.,"I bought this watch and a similar Skagen model in brown. The watch doesn't feel slim and elegant, it feels cheap. The band is ultra thin and glued not sewn, connected to the watch case by two small screws so I assume finding replacement bands will be a chore. I got the watches for around 55 dollars each and even at that price I feel like I got screwed. I own a Wenger, Seiko, Stuhrling, 2 Invictas, and have a Burett on the way. For the price I think Wenger (Swiss made), and Seiko are the way to go when it comes to quality at a reasonable price."
3,Partial review,"I'm not sure quite how to rate this book so for now, I'm giving it 3 stars. It was recommended to me by my brother-in-law, who is a police officer so I was curious. So far, I'd have to say that there is a lot of repetition in the book and it's fairly a simple concept which talks mostly about attitude. I'm sure some people would get a lot out of it as it is a reminder that your attitude can make or break your desired outcome in life. I'm actually in the middle of reading it, along with two other books, so I'll have to finish my review when I do complete the book. But for now, it's a 3!"
4,verbal judo,Very interesting presentation on improving one's social and communicative skills. Experienced marked improvement in personal relationships after reading this book.
5,Highly recommended!,"I had been anxiously awaiting the release of this book, ""Baby Hearts,"" as I had thoroughly enjoyed the authors' previous books, ""Baby Signs,"" and ""Baby Minds."" The book captivated me from the very beginning and is full of real-life examples of how babies/toddlers display their emotions to those around them. It provides parents with information they can use to nurture their children and work towards developing emotionally healthy adults. It is written in a clear and entertaining way and focuses on the different temperaments of children and how to address issues ie. temper tantrums, aggression and shyness. It also provides details regarding the research conducted with babies around the world. I found it difficult to put down and as a mom, some of the information, ie. the chapter on shame and guilt, really made me think. Highly recommended."
5,A novel noteworthy of praise,"CHASTITY INNOCENCE UNLEASHED is truly one of the best novels I reviewed. As a book reviewer of many fiction novels, I've read a lot of the best-selling fiction and none of it is better than this book. The characters are so vivid and real that the book is truly alive. Anyone who hasn''t read this novel is missing out on one of the greatest novels ever written. Sincerely, Devan"
4,SEE THIS ONE!,"For those of you who really love B-Movie style horrors, you are in for a good time here. This movie is truly one of the classics. What can be more entertaining and engrossing than giant ticks. Ticks that crawl under the skin of wayward youth in the woods. The acting is okay. The directing is slightly above average. The critters themselves are quite believable. Rent or buy this movie and sit back for a night of fun in ""The Movie Room""."
1,What went wrong..?,"Like most of the other reviewers, I have looked forward to the early-Spring releases of what HAD BEEN my favorite baseball sim/game, the ol' reliable High Heat Baseball. I'm not sure what 3DO was thinking, or even if they were, but this game is simply unacceptable on many counts. The lack of mouse support, as everyone has noted, stinks. The game is no longer smooth (in fact, I think that they have become steadily worse since the last Sammy Sosa edition in 2001). The reduction in mode-of-play options was not met with favor; simply put, this is the worst baseball game I have played on a computer. I have long had distaste for EA Sports baseball games, but I can't help but think that even EA would not release such an unpolished and dated game. Once you get past the decent visual stadium graphics, there is no gameplay value. I am sadly disappointed."
5,DLG (Dark Latin Groove)4-Ever,"DLG's latest cd ""Swing On"" is a great salsa remix cd. My favorite song ""La Soledad"" is very sweet. I enjoy listening to it. I also enjoy ""La Quiero A Morir"". Huey and James make a great team. They really know how to make you jam to their music. I recommend, all of you guys that enjoy salsa remix as much as I do, should buy this cd. I congratulate DLG for everything that they've accomplished in these past couple of years. I also wish you the best of luck in the future. Los Quiero Mucho!! Pamela Lopez"
5,Do they get better or what?,"DLG keeps it rocking with this release. I was happy to see them expand a bit with their sound-a welcome change from the ordinary Latin scene. They add something new, some sabor to their already amazing and unique sound. I became a fan by accident-I heard ""Muevete"" and fell in love. It's still my all time favorite. D L G is is on a roll and the new album is just as kick-a** as the previous 2. Good luck to them and I'm waiting on some tour dates!"
4,Good Debut,"Breed 77 are differant from all the other ""nu-metal"" bands out there but for the life of me I cant put my finger on why!maybe its because there from england but im not to sure,anyway there sound is original in a genre over-swamped in boring average metal,they sound differant and you'd know its them if they came on the radio(which can not be said for alot of bands)the lead singers voice is amazing and probably one of the best around.Stand out tracks are :""breaking the silence,Karma & Final prayer""There new album is due out shortly & ""la ultima hora"" is on it & it is an amazing song,one of the best of the year,so catch this bands debut album before they explode..."
4,Christmas gift for son,My son would watch these movies everytime they came on tv; so i thought this was a wonderful gift to get him as an adult. This product was delivered quickly and before christmas.
5,very content,"Just wanted to take time to write a few words on the product I purchased from this site. I am very satisfied. As far as the sound quality, I have not been able to crank up the volume, due to where I currently reside. But I can probably presume that I will be very satisfied with the quality. Overall I am very glad for the purchase. And the amount was totally awesome."
5,Bought for friend.,bought tis for a friend who kept on searchig every store and rental place for it glad you had it.
1,Digital Copy is Expired,Beware when buying this trilogy... If you bought this especially for the digital copy you will be extremely disappointed. It expired in 2011 and thre is no insert with the redemption code to even try and redeem it. Such a rip off
4,Back To The Future Review,"I like the films with some reservations on the the third one. Really enhanced & cleaned-up. Met my expectations on it. Having seen the films in syndacation & on DVD, I already knew what to expect story & plot-wise but going back in again & speaking character-wise, I noticed that the main character is basically this ""Master Of Ceremonies"" type. Although he's supposed to be the main character alongside the scientist, he influences the other characters as well & doesn't have direct influence on the plot. in the first one, his parents are the main characters & the third, the scientist gets the main character role. Going on to the plot of the 3 films, the first is the standard ""fix what you created"", the second took on a darker tone & the third is basically the first film all over again. Well, going back to what I said earlier, I like the films but a little iffy on the third."
2,No DTS on the USA Region 1 discs,"Shame on Universal and whoever produces these DVDs. DD is alright, but DTS is far superior. I'm mad that they'd include DTS with foreign releases of this disc and not the US version, especially after being told that the disc would include the superior audio track. I love the movie, but I'm protesting the DVD. I won't buy it."
1,umm.....,I got this and it was great but ever since I got it I've only watched #1 3 times #2 once #3 once. because it gets boring watching 2 + 3 again
4,Good but no perfect,"BD is excellent itself, nevertheless the digital copy can only be donwloaded once and It cannot be played in other Pc or laptop but the one it was donwloaded originally, that's crap."
5,Great! Ignore Packaging Reviews!,"Well for one, ignore all packaging reviews now because its been changed up. Picture and Audio; Looks great. The movies; Well, it' one of the best trilogies of all time. Plus, I got it for $15 when they had it on sale. My best Blu-Ray steal to date!"
3,Need Spanish Audio For Back To The Future For Region 1,"I've been looking for a region 1 dvd that has spanish audio for bck to the future that his compatible with region 1 dvd players and this version has almost every language except for spanish, i don't mind french, but i'd also like to watch it in spanish too. It be nice to actually have spanish a version of back to the future i'd latin american spanish. Hopefully someday when they make the newer version of the dvd to create the mistake they can also add a spanish audio to it too.I don't have it currenlty but i'm looking to get a back to the future dvd that actually has spanish audio with on it too."
3,Framing problems still exist in Dec 2004 shipments,"A warning: I just received a new copy Back to the Future trilogy from Amazon yesterday, and the DVDs I received still have the framing problem that causes the framing of the movie on the BTTF 2 and 3 DVDs to not match the framing on the theatrical release. For more information about the problem, do a web search on ""BTTF DVD framing fiasco"". It's possible to get replacements from Universal (information is given on the web page), but I'm disappointed that these defective DVDs are still in the retail pipeline."
1,Discs did not work,"I was hosting a Back to the Future Party and purchased the trilogy to show during the party. Unfortunately, NONE of the discs worked. Luckily, a friend had another set that we were able to use, but I was really disappointed that I had purchased a product that did not work."
4,Good but not the same as original release,"Is the DVD version the same as the original? I don't think so. There seems to be some changes that are different. For example I thought that the background music of 'Mr.Sandman' was sung by female voices on the original. On the DVD version, it is sung by male voices. Has anyone noticed any other discrepancies?"
5,Back to the Future Trilogy on Blu Ray....,"Back to the Future represents to me the ""Golden Years"" of 80's SciFi...With the Blu Ray it will reach, for sure, a level of richness in terms of all, picture, sound and extras...What i would suggest is for the studio to make a ""Limited Edition"" of 1500 or 3000 Box Sets, with glossy cartoon covers, post cards, film cell for parts 1,2 and 3, book with hard cover (with 200 pages...) like they did with E.T.I think the fans deserve that...My most luxurious edition is the Trilogy in Laserdisc, Muse Hi-Vision, each movie individually in a Box Set, like books with booklets, in 1080i HD, so having Blu Ray will be another progress..."
3,"First film = good, 2nd = fair, 3rd = bad","The first film was fun because of its' inventiveness but the second film was a wild brilliant ride but it was darker and disturbing. By the the third film, you were bored with the whole idea and it was just too silly to waste any time watching. Well, what the heck, watch them all in sequence but be sure your kids are older because the 2nd film is too upsetting for smaller kids."
5,Back to the future 25th anniversary edition.,It's great. And it was a very good price. I am very pleased withy this order. I recommend this to people who like sci fi because it is a great trilogy and looks amazing in blue ray
3,First one was the best,"Always felt the time difference between the first and second episodes were way too long, but I'm glad they came out. Thought number 2 was decent, but didn't like the wild west concept of number 3 at first, but it grew on me. Doc Brown is a great character and it's hard not to like Michael J Fox as Marty. Excellent supporting cast, great music and effects and the nostalgia of the 80's just made the movie work."
3,Back to the Future,"For the most part the set was in good condition. However, the first disc was scratched and was forced to order Back to the Future by itself."
1,Received 2002 version!! Not Widescreen!!,"I ordered the 2002 version when it originally came out and the discs 2 and 3 were Pan and Scan with black bars at the top and bottom to make it appear it was widescreen. I heard the 2005 version, like advertised on this page had the corrected 2 and 3 discs. I ordered from this description, what did I get? the 2002 version again, saying 2002 on all three discs!! With the same problem on discs 2 and 3. I went to the description page again, and then the Back to the Future Trilogy was under review. I went through the return process with a ""refund"" being my only option. Hopefully I get refunded the entire amount or the correct version this time."
4,Fine deal for 3 fun films,"I like shopping on Amazon...it's easy to find what I want, usually at a very fair price. It's also easy to order, with no hassels and no problems so far. This is a fine set of films, suitable for the whole family. It's nice that the shipping is the same as if it were one DVD. Very happy with this purchase"
5,Excellent DVD Package!,"This is one of the best DVD packages to come along. The misformatting problem, that has been previously discussed, is hardly a reason to rate this product down. Unless you are a technogeek with too much time on your hands, the misformatted scenes will not be noticed. I challenge anyone who has not been influenced my other web sites to identify scenes that are misformatted. It would be nearly impossible, and should play no role in you decision to buy this product. The extras are superb, featuring commentaries, a Q & A session, and behind the scenes footage. This is one of the best DVD packages ever released, and I highly recommend it to everyone."
5,Timeless movie trilogy,"Back tto the Future is a classic , a look back to the 50's, forward to . well . a few years from now. Micheal J. Fox is wonderful as is the rest of the cast. I had to have this set, as it never gets old to watch, compleatly entertaining, with a lesson to be learned from watching it. The Blue ray is a compleatly differant experiance to watch and be able to engage in the movie and mark your favorite places."
4,Great package ....,I love these movies and the DVDs are great loaded with extras like deleted footage and the outtakes are very funny!... I guess Bob Gale should've but the DTS track on the movies.
5,How To Get The Movies Out Of The Case!!!!,"Since everyone knows this set is awesome, they probably know the case is some strange puzzle. If you haven't figured it out, to take the movies out put your finger on the top of the disc and push down, this will push these tiny clips inside and then you can lift the disc out from the top."
4,Tabs broken on Case,"Love the BTF movies, and they look awesome on Blu-ray at 1080p. Problem is with the Case that holds the Blu-Ray movies. Two of the plastic tabs that hold the Blu Ray discs in place have already broken. It's a poor design, and you may want to hold off until they are released individually in standard Blu Ray cases.I bought some replacement cases to store the Discs in, but wish I had artwork to insert in the cases.Would be great if Universal Pictures offered standard Blu Ray replacement cases with artwork to solve this problem."
5,Not the Same Old Re-Hash,"My comment about the difference in the sequels to BTTF is this: the ideal sequel--in my book--is one that expands on the original story. Movies that repeat the same plot, same jokes, same gimmicks, miss the point of good storytelling.If you want the same story, or are obsessive enough to want to repeat the same experience, then watch that movie again.In any case, I really enjoyed all three of BTTF. We got to know the characters better and at deeper levels.I recall, while watching BTTF III in the theatre, feeling close to tears when the Mary Steenburgen character almost fell off the train.I guess the moral of the differing comments here, is that everyone sees movies from their own perspective."
4,"If you love this film, you'll love this package","Great collection, has almost everything you'd want to see.The only thing missing: interviews with 'Doc'. I mean, come on! You gotta have interviews with him if you want this to truly be a complete special edition.Still, great stuff, especially the making-of specials."
5,"5 Stars movie 1, forget the others","I can't believe so many people are whining about aspect ratios and editing in movies 2 and three when we shouldn't be getting them shoved down our throat in the first place.The real outrage here is that a 3-movie price is being charged for the first (and only worthwhile) movie. Either release them separately or charge a single DVD price for the lot. I've been looking forward to Back to the Future's release on DVD for some time, but I won't be forced to buy any additional movies which I don't want."
5,worth it,Usually anything is better on blu-ray but a classic like back to the future is more worth it than most movies.
2,Movies are good,The movies are great. I'm just upset how they arrived. The case is broken and every corner of the case has been squised The disc don't look used. I'm just mad they handled the case wrong.
3,COOL OLDIE,"Michael Fox was in his prime when this movies came out. After so many years, I still get kick of seeing this movie trio."
5,This is Heavy!,"It's out! It's out! The Back to the Future trilogy is finally out on DVD!!!! I'm so excited!!! I've loved this movie since I was itty bitty!!! It came out when I was a year old and I've been watching it for 17 years! Heck, Marty McFly was my first crush! You know you've seen a movie too many times when you can not only recite all the lines by heart, but also every note of music too! If you haven't seen this movie (do you live under a rock?), rent it, buy it, just do something and see it QUICK! It's a classic!"
1,Download codes missing from box,"This set comes with the download disks, but no download codes to access them. THere was no paper sheet with the codes in the box or codes printed anywhere. Emails to Universal went unanswered. Paid extra just for the digital copies. Will return. Disappointed customer.UPDATE: Amazon customer service was able to help me contact Universal and I did receive the download codes from them by email. I have not downloaded them yet, but will update once I have a chance."
3,BTTF is a good 3 disc DVD Set,"I enjoyed watching BTTF, I bought the wide screen version. Disc 1 & 2 were fine, but disc 3 had errors. I guess there is a production problem with them, and Feb. is a target date for the fixed DVD's. I might want to wait awhile before I ordered. But, the movie was great, great fun to see again after all these years."
1,Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Widescreen Editio,"Disappointing that Universal rush this product out without further TQM, in simply trying to beat that Christmas rush in hoping to make a few extra $$$. I would had rather waited then unknowningly bought a deceptive sub-standard product that advertised ""Widescreen"" only to find out that it is ""cropped."" Waste of time and effort for the many buyers, who will have to spend the extra $$$ to simply send both Disc 2 & 3 in simply getting the correct ""widescreen"" edition. It is also sad, that many other people who do not have Internet access or knowledge that the item they had bought is sub-standard and it is more unforgiving that that Universal still allow this current Wide-screen edition to be sold."
3,Not Closed Captioned as Stated,"For those of you that care if a DVD is truly closed captioned or not, beware this DVD set is not closed captioned. Amazon has listed this in error. Universal does not encode their DVD's with closed caption but in English they use ""captions"" which are actually subtitles. This is important information if you use a TV Guardian to filter out foul language."
2,Didn't disclose covers condition,Cover was in bad shape. Water damage and spots if dirt all over. Cd were ok inside.
2,Back to the future,"I bought this bluray for my husbands birthday and when he went to watch it, it started skipping and wouldn't play. It turned out that the blu ray was scratched and we can't watch it. Not happy at all."
3,Back to the future trilogy,"I gave the movie 3 stars because the third part was scratched. BUt I give Amazon 5 stars for their cutomer satisfaction, they sent me a brand new trilogy."
2,Not the Best Research,"I found myself filling in a lot of blanks. Romano could have done better research on a few of these movies. He does not include Cagney on Cagney as a source and it shows. In the autobiography, Cagney discusses several things he did to train for the movies, like how much weight he lost, life experience as a fighter, his trainers, and where he got his keen ability to move like a boxer. He lost 35 pounds for City for Conquest, and that's not in the book. I lost trust for the author as a careful researcher. If he did not bother to read a source as important as Cagney's autobiography, what else did he not do? And I don't think he's ever head of Terrible Joe Moran. Don't waste your time on this rushed to print gimmick book. The table of contents is the best part.If you must have this get it our of a bargain bin or hold out for a 2nd edition, with updates and revisions."
1,Waste of Money,"This product is a waste of money. After reading some of the positive reviews, I decided to waste $20+ on it to see if it will help. I used it on my mild acne for over a month and I didn't notice the smallest change or effectiveness. Don't buy this product. Waste of money and time."
1,Used to love this product.,"I used to love this product. Then about six months ago, La Roche Posay changed the formula. Now there is an ""anti-relapse"" ingredient which wasn't there before. The whole consistency of the product has changed, the way it works changed, and when you begin using it, it no longer effectively spot treats acne. I used to be able to use this product and get results within a day! Now, if I use this product, my acne gets worse. I wish La Roche Posay was still offering their original formula, which was so effective and smelled great."
4,Loving this so far,"Like many other reviewers, I've tried many products to treat my adult skin that breaks out (especially around the chin area). I received this about two weeks ago, and have been using it only at night before I go to bed. Typically, I find if I use a product like this twice a day my skin gets dry and flaky, so I limit to once a day. I am so impressed with this product! Instantly, my skin looks better - smoother, with the pores less visible. I've noticed that I am hardly breaking out anymore. Based on this I am going to buy another product from their line."
5,Great for teens with acne!!!,"This acne treatment works very well for my teenage daughter. We have tried other products, but this seems to work the best and is reasonably priced."
2,New Formula Doesn't Work :(,"It's sad for me to give Effaclar K two stars. I started using this product in 2007, and it kept my face perfectly clear until 2011. It was a miracle product! I would get compliments on my clear skin all the time. Then, in the fall of 2011, they changed the formula to add an ""Anti Relapse"" ingredient. When I used the new formula, I got more blackheads and I started breaking out again. The consistency of the formula has changed, and it simply doesn't work. I REALLY wish I could continue getting the old formula, and now I have to find a replacement for the product I used to love.If anyone has any suggestions for products that are similar to the old formula of Effaclar K, please let me know!"
4,A Good Read,"This is a book worth reading. The characters are believable, the setting is detailed and also believable, it is well-written and the story itself is interesting and exciting. I will recommend this book to all my reader friends and I am already searching out more by this author. Two thumbs up and a big thank you!"
4,Pretty Darn Good!,"Excellent story about Kelyn, who was raised by her mother and needs to search for her father - the Wolverine - in order to really find who she is. Since she's pretty handy in the wild as well as with self-defense, this sounds like a cinch...with the exception of a little curse placed by someone close to her... Loved it! Can't wait for the sequel."
1,don't buy this,bought one that leaked and bought another that leaked they are sun shades that are very expensive don't waste your money and nobody will take care of you the dealer or paha ha ha que
3,Didn't work for me :-/,"I thought this would end up being the best eye makeup remover EVER, based on reviews and research, but I was sadly disappointed. Maybe I just use a stronger mascara then it can handle. I end up working it around lashes in 18 different directions, then I wash my face and theres STILL mascara under my eyes. I think it's a waste of money for those who wear waterproof. It required more work and time then I wanted to commit, at the end of the day, when all I want to do is face plant into bed. I think ""Bare eyes"" and ""philosophy"" are pretty good removers. I'd suggest those instead. :)"
2,Library addition,"Perhaps I just didn't read the description close enough, but I didn't realize this was a library edition, with all the stickers, etc that it entails."
3,Have not purchased yet,I have only read the sample of this book. Price seems too high for a Kindle book. If I see it come down on price I will buy this book. So far the sample was good.
4,To Short,"I was disapointed as there could have been more to it.Having been around the racetrack myself.I knew a lot of female Exercise Riders,Grooms,and Trainers that were great in their jobs.I feel that women have just as much right as men as long as they qualify.I also feel that they should be paid for their accomplishement.It upsets me when I see men get paid more in some sports than men like Bowling,Tennis,Etc."
4,I Liked It****,My best friend loves this movie. I liked it. It has its funny parts. Good to watch once every few years. Better to rent than own in my opinion.
5,the best movie ever,it'll keep this short and sweet. blazin sadles is the funnyest movie on the planet!!!!! it's start to CRY IT'S SO FUNNY!!! it's my all time favorite movie i love so BUY IT!!!!!
2,It is what it is,"i watched it through once, but did not enjoy it. Pretty corny. Hard to review it. For those with a slightly warped sense of humor."
5,Mel Brooks film...says it all ;),Mel Brooks films are always funny! This one is no exception...the cast are fantastic. You can't go wrong with a Mel Brooks film if your looking for comedy. :)
5,"blazing saddles,excellent",This movie will keep you laughing and laughing no matter how many times you watch it.
5,"Super Excellent Blu-Ray...""N"" word Alert!!!!!!","Wow...I've seen it so many times on regular TV, I forgot about the many, many times the ""N"" word is used. Just letting you know if that kind of thing bothers you. To be fair...I did hear cracker once or twice.But if you get it, like most people do, then buy this if you ever liked the movie at all. The picture and sound is excellent.I love it when you find a Special Feature that is good, it's like finding a gem. Check out the pilot for Black Bart in the special features. It's a mid-70's attempt to put the character on a sitcom during primetime. Lou Gosset Jr. plays Bart. They continue the ""N"" word tradition that's for sure. But, for some reason it seems more unacceptable...watch it and you will see why, well, watch it and imagine it's on during primetime in 1975 and you will see why. But, it is quite entertaining and a good find.BUY THIS."
5,Irreverent and deliciously so!,"What a lot of people don't understand about this movie is that Richard Pryor was one of the principal script writers and he was intended to play the part of the Sheriff of Johnsonville. Unfortunately, the studio could not insure Pryor, so Cleavon Little was chosen for the lead instead. And once that is explained, I think everyone suddenly understands all the cursing. Coupled with Brooks's blatant disregard for common decency - and you have the gem that ""Blazing Saddles"" truly is. Harvey Korman is masterful as the dastardly Hedley Lamar, Slim Pickins is brilliant as his evil side-kick, Madeline Kahn shines in her 1st acting role - and Cleavon Little coupled with Gene Wilder makes this the ultimate kick in the rear for Buddy Westerns.If you want a good belly aching laugh ( The Fart Scene - or Kahn singing ""I'm Tired""), this is a fine addition to any video collection."
3,[...],"[...] Gene WIlder is usually superb, but in this film he acts bored and in a constant daze. I know [his character is] supposed to be an alcoholic, but his performance slows down the movie enough to leave you bored. Sure this movie has some funny scenes, but this is not a movie that can be watched over and over again and be praised as a classic. It deserves to be seen by everybody at least once, but that's about it."
1,Disappointing,"Perhaps it's understandable that a film 37 years after its release no longer is funny. Juvenile and unimpressive, unfortunately, and severely dated."
5,Pushing comedic boundaries that can't be pushed anymore.,"Mel Brooks' 1974 Blazing Saddles is a classic film in the making. The humor depicting stereotypes of white and blacks in this movie would stir quite a bit of controversy nowadays. The film should not be looked at as a racist film at all. If anything, they are making fun of stupid white racist hicks the most. Mel Brooks was definitely way ahead of his time, poking fun at a touchy subject, then and now. This film stars Mel Brooks, Madeline Kahn, Gene Wilder, and Slim Pickens, all delivering incredible performances. I first saw this movie when I was about 15. It seemed fresh a new then, as it does today as a 23 year old. Everybody should see this masterpiece of filmmaking in Mel Brooks filmography. You will definitely understand why this film is always in the top ten of those ""Top 100 Funniest Movies"" lists."
4,A More Crude Version of Men In Tights,"I've seen a few Mel Brooks movies, so I'm a bit familiar with his style. It's always silly, but in a way that works. Blazing Saddles is no exception. It's about as funny as Robin Hood Men in Tights, which is a good thing, but it's really nasty in a lot of places, especially with regards to racism. Still, Blazing Saddles probably does paint an accurate picture of how harsh racism was back in the late 1800's, even though I'm sure that's not what Mel Brooks was aiming for when he donned the jacket with ""GOV"" written on the back and crossed his eyes as he prepared for his small role here."
2,FROZE UP!,This movie was unwatchable. It seemingly 'rasterized' throughout and eventually just froze up. Will probably not purchase another movie from Amazon via Roku.
3,An early effort from one of the world's best,"Three stars is about right for this film. Kusturica has become a phenomenal director, and while some of his more familiar tropes are present here--the anti-hero, extreme zaniness, gypsy music, etc.--this film doesn't compare to his later films, especially Time of the Gypsies and Underground.That's not to say this is a bad movie; quite the contrary. It's just that Kusturica's later films are so good that this one seems disappointing by comparison.However, it's worth watching if for no other reason than the interview with Kusturica that's one of this dvd's extras. Kusturica tells about his filmmaking style, his ethos, and how he was influenced by studying at the Prague Film School, as well as by Hollywood pictures from the 1940s to the 1970s. It's very informative, and goes a long way toward helping one understand his later movies."
5,A Class Act !,"I loved the first album so much I had to get ""As Time Goes By"" I really never listen to Rod Stewart until The Great American Songbook. If you appreciate music from this era you will definitely enjoy this CD. The instrumentation is great, and the music is very relaxing. Rod adds a touch of class to these great american songs."
4,how one has adjusted,"Rod has always been ahead of the curve and now he has reinvented himself, singing all the old standards songs that have always pleased.Rod does it again an we thank him, enjoyed endless hours of soft and enjoyable sounds."
2,There are better performers doing these standards.,"I really don't like this CD. I love Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Diane Krall, Frank Sinatra, even Michael Buble at times, Louis Armstron, Fred Astaire, early Barbara Streisand, John Pizzerelli and the like. Rod Stewart comes up flat on these covers. Sorry."
4,A Mixed Bag,"I didn't enjoy this collection quite as much as Volume One, but it does have its strengths. The title track, ""As Time Goes By,"" sung as a duet with Queen Latifa, is probably the best rendition of this classic song that I have ever heard. On the other hand, the duet of ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"" (sung with Cher)is downright painful to listen to (and this is one of my favorite songs ever). I have long been a fan of both Rod Stewart AND the ""Great American Songbook,"" but his particular style only works on about half of the songs--but when it does work, the result is often a fresh, innovative, soulful interpretation of an old classic. Like its predecessor, this collection has strengths and weaknesses, but, on balance, I would much rather listen to Rod Stewart sing these great songs than to Frank Sinatra or Nat King Cole singing ""Maggie May"" or ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy."""
4,nice variety,"the earliest of the stories are set and were written around the victorian times. there's a lot of variety here: truckers, bikers, young students, threeways, army, glory hole, gladiators, s&m, pnp, even a fantasy/sci-fi story, a sherlock holmes story, and some cybersex. these stories may not have so much plot, but since they're excerpts from masquerade books it'll whet your appetite for the full novels these excerpts came from. recommended."
5,Fantastic under-priced oil,"I used this in my Camaro with a TH350 and noticed a HUGE improvement in shifting and smoothness over Pennzoil or other brand name Dexron oil. Recently I had to change the transmission oil on my 1998 Honda Civic with an automatic and read that this was OK to use as it is a ""Honda/Acura ATF-Z1 fluid (except in CVTs)"" as it says on the bottle. The Honda had a small slip issue in 1st to 2nd gear so I decided I might as well try this. After draining and refilling the transmission with 3 quarts I noticed NIGHT AND DAY difference. The slipping stopped immediately and I could barely feel the car jerk at all to shift. I drove for a day then drained and refilled with another 3 quarts of Valvoline Max Life and I have NEVER had such smooth shifts since I owned the car. I will be using this oil from now on. Highly recommended."
5,"A ""real life"" page turner","I read ""Never Give In, Never Give Up"" in two days. Carlana Stone Lawson's life story reads like a novel thanks to the beautiful writing of John Di Rienzo. Her gripping story is nothing short of heroic and affirms that we all have the capacity to thrive, not just survive, in the face of loss and adversity. Let her show you how it's done. You won't want to put it down."
4,An Expose' Review,"I always like to hear re-mixed or longer versions of familiar songs from artists CD/LPs. This CD has the songs I liked the most from this group and did a good job remixing some of the tracks. Overall, this CD is worth owning."
4,A Good Introduction To Black Inventors,"If you're looking for a brief review of some of the contributions of Black Inventors to American proseprity. ""Black Inventors Stars"" is an excellent source to get you started. It is geared towards a younger audience but would be a useful source for all ages. Simply because Black history is not taught in main stream education, you have to search it out. Consequently a lot of people are ignorant to the contribuitions of Blacks to American Society. And that includes not a few Black adults. So if you are looking for a brief synopis to gain knowledge yourself or an introduction of Black history to your children. I would say buy this book it is a good source for beginning knowledge, for any race, to learn how the inventions of black people have subsidized America."
4,Metal band - not the Seattle Celtic folk rock band by the same name,"Here are the tracks:1. Blind Me 4:592. Blackened Sea 4:423. Lies 4:024. Punish 6:175. Mask of Clowns 5:466. Plastic World 3:067. Tomorrow Never Knows 4:228. Won't Keep 3:41The CD is black with calligraphy style writing ""ockham's razor"".There's another band out there with the same name that released their own self titled album at about the same time this one was which was in 1996!"
1,Crappy service,"I bought this game for my grandson for Christmas, but Santa got him one also. Now Game Clasics tells me that I can't return it because it's past the 30 days. I will never buy another thing from those people. I'm out 57.00."
4,Swell album,"Very good album, love the music. Nice to be able to find anything on AMAZON!!! Received it in a timely fashion."
2,"IMO, not as good as Once","Well, I absolutely love the Once soundtrack. It's passionate, well-balanced and fun. The Swell Season album misses on all of these marks.They actually re-worked a few tracks from Once, and unfortunately, didn't improve them at all. I'd rather listen to the originals.And the new songs are almost all Glen singing, and just aren't very interesting.I bought this, listened to it twice, then simply gave it to my friend, who actually felt the same way about it.Stick to Once."
4,Glen Hansard The Swell Season,"Bought only because of cut #4 from movie ""Once"" and love the entire album. If you like Damien Rice, you'll like this."
4,"Good addition to ""Once"" cd","After seeing ""Once"", I immediately purchased the soundtrack. Soon I discovered this cd - it has some of the same tracks with slightly different arrangements and I enjoyed the other tracks immensely. If you liked ""Once"", you'll like this cd - there's a couple of tracks that just rip your heart out."
4,Not the 5 stars everyone was writing about but still good,There are still some great songs in here but some louder singing in a couple songs seem to break up and not mesh entirely well with what I would otherwise definitely call a beautiful hamonious work/effort. The strings and voices balance well in all the other songs that I would play during a nice dinner party (except during the louder couple of songs).
5,Buy this CD!!!!!,"Love Irish music, Indie bands or just want to explore a new sound? Buy this fabulous CD, with many songs from the low budget, highly entertaining Irish film Once."
4,Bedded by the Boss,"One of my favorite Miranda Lee's; the hero has depth that is not often seen in short contemporary romance, he is lovable, compassionate, strong, vibrant, and passionate. Jessie is vulnerable and but resilient, easily engaging my sympathy, and Emily is just an adorable child. I will give it 4.5"
3,This book badly needs a glossary,"I'm certain that a knowledgeable structural or mechanical engineer would find this book accessible and helpful. As a novice boatbuilder whose experience is limited to cedar-strip canoes, I found it completely baffling in both important senses. It did not explain to me how to transfer a boat plan to a form, and it did not explain how to construct the boat. Mostl;y, this is due to my unfamiliarity with the technical language and/or the fact that the author makes some pretty broad assumptions about the knowledge the reader has coming into the book.This is NOT a book for the novice boat-builder."
1,Worthless anit-history,"This book should be avoided by anyone wishing to learn about history. It is largely fiction, often deliberately misleading by misquoting historical sources. It is also nasty and insulting to anybody who has investigated actual history"
1,Dishonest writing,"If one is writing fiction, then one can freely tamper with the FACTS, BUT IF ONE IS writing history, or attempting to write history, it is an essential duty to remain honest. Instead, Loomis is dishonest, invents from whole cloth and deliberately alters quotations from source to make it appear to say the opposite of what they really are saying. As such, this book should be held up as an example of dishonest writing."
5,Excellent resource!,A great book for anyone associated with family's who live with Asperger Syndrome. Practical ideas are interwoven among interesting stories told from a first person perspective. This author knows how to hold the reader's attention and how to teach without preaching. I highly recommend this book. J.P.
5,Charming Book!,"This is a beautiful book. I love the whimsical twist in the story.The book is beautifully illustrated. I highly recommend this book. It is colorful, and easy to read."
3,"Nice, but a little confusing","I enjoyed the book. Nice story & the illustrations were lovely, but a little off regarding Biblical consistency. I felt it was a little confusing for my little ones."
1,Typesetting ruins a great book,"I love the hardcover version of this book and was really excited to see I could get it on the kindle. It was the first thing I ordered and was the first big disappointment.The typesetting for the math equations makes many of them essentially unreadable with characters overstriking other characters, super and subscripts far from the characters they are super or subscripting, etc..It appears to me that Amazon is probably using OCR technology that isn't handling this stuff well. Personally I think they should reimburse me for this poorly transcribed version of what is such a great book in the hardcover version although I'm not going to push it."
3,Very theory-heavy,"This book takes an interesting topic and makes it pretty boring. Additionally, much of the technology discussed is woefully out of date, as this book was published in 1991. I would not mind a newer edition if it could be made more pertinent to the state of science and technology in current society."
1,disappointing & mediocre,I found this book very disappointing. It's more a showcase for not very good painters than a useful source of information on composition techniques. I did not recognize any of the names from the fine work I've seen in the International Artist's magazine but rather ordinary & mediocre examples. Explanations were wordy & dogmatic rather than visually instructive.The material is not organized in any formal manner for a subject such as this...Generally disappointing in every respect.
5,Design & Composition Secrets,"A very useful and informative text. Many artists tend to ignore the Design aspect in Art to their loss. This text reveals how successful artists consider this critical aspect in the concept and planning stage of great works of Art. I have found this a very helpful book, and look forward to producing finer works of Art as a result."
4,Solid,"It was the perfect pot rack for our kitchen.Nice, solid and compact.We only had it a month or two before we sold the house. The buyers wanted it, we didn't let them have it.We have it boxed up and ready to install in the next house!"
2,POLITICS AND GUNSMr. Weir,"Mr Weir, while doing great work on the research end, has seemingly decided to use this important debate as yet another forum to advance socialist causes. The author uses both sides as ""Boogey Men"" and goes on to blame economic factors as the cause of all evil. I believe the author would have made his case better if he had concentrated more upon the spiritual, moral, and family decay that has occured over the last fourty years. Also, he may have wanted to review the ""Federalist Papers"" prior to writing his book. Thank You."
1,Biggest fraud,"Before, Dlink ANT24-1801 is stated as omni-directional antenna. Until recently, they had to change the declaration to a directional antenna. Why would I buy a $260 ant24-1801 if it just deliver the same performance as the ant24-1800 at half it's cost ($160). I don't get it.Anyway, I tested it side by side with a D-Link G800AP and this antenna vs. Linksys WRT54GS with its bundled 2 antenna. Result shows that Linksys signal was even better.I find THIS antenna to be unless."
2,Great until you try to use it,"Streets & Trips 2004 crashes every time I try to find a particular address. MDAC 2.8 and Jet 4.0 Service Pack 8 didn't fix anything. Nice software, Microsoft. What is it that you do again?"
2,Not what I hoped for,"Coming to Canada from Europe, I hoped that this would be similar to the excellent Autoroute products I had used there. The front end and user stuff is the same, and pretty decent. But the problem is the limited number of road/place ID's. Within a month of buying it (on the day it was released) I identified 4 locations that it couldn't find. And that isn't just roads, some towns and villages aren't there either. It also isn't smart enough to find 'Street' or 'Road' - it requires the abbreviation. Maybe it is better in USA, but for Canada it's a big disappointment."
5,Good Stuff Here,"Lost? Need a little direction in your life? Then this softy is for you. UI is easy, prints beautifully, creates html, emails pics, and works great with my laptop and USB GPS!Fantastic software. Highly recommended.[Much better than DeLorme]"
1,Microsoft Streets and Trips,"Beware purchasing Microsoft Streets and Trips programs. I received this software free along with my purchase in 2000 of a Dell portable computer. I grew to love MS Streets and Trips and used it for every trip I would take, to map the area I was going to. Then I upgraded to Windows XP and POOF! Streets and Trips software worked no more. When I called both Dell and Microsoft to find out why, I was told I needed to pay $30 for a one-time technical assistance session to fix the problem! What a complete and utter rip off! Next time I'll find some other software made by a company who isn't as error-prone and/or greedy."
2,Not up to standard,"Although this program is useful in many ways, it suffers from two major faults: (1) the road network is not up-to-date in terms of either locations or attributes, and (2) the routing algorithm used is very strange indeed. This may reflect very bad information on the difficulty of traversing specific links or else may be a significant software bug. I use the program frequently but it is certainly not state of the art!"
1,Disappointment,"I bought this product just for the pocket street as it doesn't make sense to take your lap in the car to look at maps and directions. Well was disappointing for 2 reasons:1- you have to cut the map yourself for instance I tried to put whole michigan on my PDA , it wouldn't let me , although I had enough memory on my iPAQ memory card. It let me put part of a map e.g. The Detroit area. The company should pre-divide the maps to larger parts that can be place on the PDA2- The GPS: I was happy that the pocket street worked on my GPS system, but was of not much us because it tells you where you are but you can't plan a route and doesn't tell you where to go. not much use.In short a disappointment. There are better systems for PDA and for planning your route."
2,Didn't Work,"I was disappointed by not being able to even try the software out. Every time I would try to find an address, the software would crash. I found this to be a common problem for all gererations of the software according to Microsoft's knowledge base. There is no patch to fix the problem that I could find, only a ""workaround"" which didn't work for me. Therefore, my ability to offer an informed rating is inhibited by my inability to even use the software."
1,Microsoft Streets & Trips 2004,This product is totally worthless for getting from point A to B. It does not begin to compare with the free sites on the internet. I haven't been pleased with any map yet that I have prepared. (One went 22 miles out of the way and took 30 minutes longer.) It's logic makes no sense to me whatsoever. Do not waste your money on this software.
2,301 COUNTRY CHRISTMAS QUILT BLOCKS,"Altho there are instuctions for several projects in which to use a number of the blocks in this book, most of the blocks are of many different sizes and would require re-sizing or adding borders, etc. to combine in a quilt project. This is true of the 12 days of christmas blocks. There are also several blocks labeled: ""create"" which I took to mean you drafted the design yourself from the small picture. Most applique patterns were not full sized, & have to be enlarged. I have used & enjoyed this author's patterns before, but was disappointed in this book."
5,good daily practice,This is a good warmup language practice book to use with students each day. It is easy to use and has plenty of activities reinforcing literacy.
3,CHERRY FALLS review,"When two teens are brutally killed, the small town of Cherry Falls starts to suspect that a serial killer is knocking off young, high school virgins. Oddball teen slasher/black comedy is typically familiar but a good cast, sharp script and stylish direction makes this a more entertaining effort than the modern genre fodder. Made for cable. American debut for Australian filmmaker Wright."
2,Lame,"At one point I said to my wife, if Emily's friend Charlie turns out to be ""X"" I'm really going to be pissed. Charlie was ""X"". Predictable. Bad. If you liked the movie Identity - the lamest thriller of all time - you will like this. Dakota's acting is incredible but the story and premise are just stupid. Terrible writing. Did a 10 year old write this piece of junk? People are actually getting paid real money to write this garbage? There's more mystery, tension, and suspense in what lies beneath all that mold in the vegetable drawer in my fridge than you will find here. What the heck happened to the DeNiro we once knew? Pathetic. Just pathetic."
2,"Move along folks, no story here...","After Dr. David Calloway's wife commits suicide, he and his daughter, Emily, move upstate where Emily finds a so-called imaginary friend named 'Charlie'. And that's what happens for 3/4 of the movie, almost 1 1/2 hours of nothing! It's sort of like wasting hours reading a novel when the one paragraph description on the back pretty much summed it all up."
5,Excellent Movie,"My mom rented this movie. I didn't see the beggining but I saw the middle. I'm watching the ending right now. So far, it's excellent. It scared me at some parts but most of the movie is not scary."
4,Just enough mystery,"I really liked this movie. As always, De Niro is great! I usually guess the ending very early into the movie, but this one caught me. I had a hard time playing the alternate endings. Great!"
2,"TRIED TO HIDE, BUT IT FOUND ME!","Sorry Charlie, but you failed at making a great thriller. Thats what I said after watching this movie. It is about a man and his doughter who just moved into a new house. But as they days go by, he notices that his daughter made a imaginary friend named Charlie. But Charlie isn't really nice. He kills innocent people and goes after Dakotta Fanning. But is he really made up, or is somebody hiding something?That is for you to find out. But it was a little to weird for my taste. If you like mysterious thrillers, then you will like this movie. But sadly, I didn't."
1,One of the worst of the year,"I saw this movie, because of the buzz over the shocking ending that supposedly was delivered as a seperate reel to movie theaters a day before it was released to keep the ending a secret. What a big waste. Deniro, and fanning are great actors, and i have no idea why they were in this film, or why this movie was even made. If you've seen secret window, or fight club, you've seen this movie. The ending takes forever, but it it so obvious. If you have half a brain, you can figure this movie out in the first 20 minutes. I figured it out, and unfortunately i was correct. Just a horrible, horrible waste. So obvious, and boring. Dont waste your time."
3,"I liked everything about it, except the movie","As a previous reviewer said, all the top-notch production values can't save a film with a bad script. I've always liked de Niro, and am endlessly impressed with the remarkable and intuitive Dakota Fanning. Famke Janssen is gorgeous as ever, and it's really good to see Elizabeth Shue & Amy Irving working again. I didn't hate this film as much as others, or the critics, but something just didn't connect. I'm thinking it's director John Polson's handling of Dakota's character. After all, when Charlie starts doing mean things, she should've made a few connections. The DVD is fine, with a terrific 2.40:1 widescreen, showing off some wonderful scenery, well photographed. Unfortunately, most everything takes place indoors. There's also 4 alternate endings, none of which would've made a difference in the long run. Once Charlie is unmasked, the film loses its momentum. Some nice extras, but overall, I'm glad a friend loaned it to me before I bought it."
4,Im confused!,"this was the most confusing movie ive ever seen! i didnt get the ending of who charlie really was until my older brother explained it to me.. but im still confused on parts of it...mayb its because ive never seen secret window which people say has the same plot, or its cuz i dont really kno much about people with split-personalities! i am still confused!!! i thot it was a great idea for a movie until the split-personality-confusingness came out!"
3,Not pleased with the movie...,"I was so disappointed in this movie. It was obvious who Charlie was and there was so many questions I still had at the end that made me mad. Such as what was up with the neighbor and why did both of them seem creepy for no reason? Why did everyone always tell her she was so beautiful? It got real annoying after a while because nothing came from that story line either. And it was obvious who Charlie was from the middle of the movie. I didn't like that I knew who he was. I just felt this movie was lacking in a story the actors and actresses were fine the story was weak. It tried to throw people off so it started story lines but never ended them--which is quite annoying leaving a movie going okay but why was this person doing this, etc. I was hoping for a good creepy movie but this movie did nothing for me and was a disappointment."
1,stupid!,Im a monster fan not a horror fan but i gave this a try but it stunk there was no Charlie dont watch this.
3,hide and seek,"It's an obvious film, who Charlie is, especially when people tell you before you get the chance to see it. It's kind of boring and slow to watch. It has it's moments and suspence but it's nothing to get worked up over. Dakota did a good job though so it's worth seeing her act."
3,HIDE AND SEEK (WIDESCREEN EDITION),"I THOUGHT THAT DAKOTA FANNING AND ROBERT DENIRO DID WELL WITHTHE MATERIAL. IT WAS NOT THE BEST SUSPENSE MOVIE I HAVE SEEN,AND I FELT THE PLOT WAS SOMEWHAT PREDICTABLE, BUT ALL IN ALLNOT A BAD MOVIE. I THINK IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH SEEING."
2,Surprising Ending? There's A Whole Load Full Of Similar Movies Like This.,"The actors are great, only problem is that the movie didn't ultilize their full potential. As in surprise ending, predicted it in the beginning and firmed my prediction after 30 minutes. Nowadays audience are harder to trick, more or less I suppose, because of the many movies out now. Most ideas that movies base themselves on, plots, settings, etc are already taken in past movies. Its very hard finding originals nowadays and still there's no definate originals even if they try. I'm already seeing a limit to songs as it is. Nowadays, people just remake songs over again to bring it back, other words? They're running out of ideas.I did sort of got scared in some parts, but again its just the surprise and not really anything else.You should watch this if you want to know whats it about etc, because its not a HORRIBLE and totally time wasting movie since they do have to great actors in there, its just not all that great. Enjoy."
4,Good thriller,"People need to get a grip! Everyone seems to complain about scary movies, never being satisfied. This is a good movie, boardering on great. Great plot twists, great performances. Just watch it!"
3,I'll keep this short but sweet.,"-Pretty good thriller that holds your attention for 90 minutes.-Dakota Fanning is excellent and looks better as a brunette. Sometimes you forget she is a child. If she were a character in Lolita, Humbert Humbert would label her a nymphet.-Elisabeth Shue is useless, and has horrible chemistry with DeNiro.-Famke Jansen is nice in this.-""What is up with the neighbors?"" A lot of people have asked this question, but isn't it obvious? They lost a daughter to cancer WHO LOOKED JUST LIKE Dakota Fanning's Emily.-The movie has been compared to Secret Window, but the characters aren't as over the top as Johnny Depp's and John Turturro's, and I find Hide and Seek to be better.-Once again, nothing stellar, but it's a nice entertaining movie to occupy 90 minutes of your time. Everytime it comes on cable, I always watch at least a portion of it."
4,Thriller NOT Horror Movie,"I read some of the reviews by people who are saying this is a sad attempt at a horror movie etc. First let me say this is NOT a horror movie. It is a thriller and a pretty good one at that.I watched this a couple of nights ago and really like this movie. The acting is top notch, I have a feeling if there were other actors here the movie may have been rather flat yet De Nero and Fanning bring this movie home.The story, while a little predictable has enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. I doubt you will be truly frighten with this movie, but you will no doubt become invested with the characters if you let yourself.The ending is fantastic and I think the director got it just right. In the DVD version there are 4 more alternate endings, but the one in the main film is the best in my opinion.All in all it's a good movie that doesn't require a lot of thinking, but will leave you satisfied at the end"
3,Fills in Blanks; Answers some Questions,"This book, of course, is part of the prequel to the Lahaye/Jenkins fictional series that is based on the biblical account of the world's end. As with the series, this is no work of literary genius, but it is thought provoking and may encourage the reader to pick up the Bible to see what's really in there. If you are not a Christian, you might not enjoy this, or any Left Behind related title, but I wouldn't discourage you from giving it a try. If you have an anti-Christian bent, this is not the book for you. Fans of the Left Behind Series will find answers to some lingering questions, and have some blanks filled in."
2,The Rising is a disappointment,"I really liked the Left Behind series and looked forward to reading the new prequel""The Rising"", but this book was definitely a disappointment for several reasons. The character development was slow and tedius, and by the time the book picked up the pace there was little interest in what happened to the characters. We are to assume that since this book takes places years before the Rapture that the timing is probably during the 1960's, but the characters have all the modern technology that exists now, such as the cell phone, computers, email,etc. It was distracting and odd that the authors would do this. I found Nicolae to be a totally ridiculous and unbelievable character, and in the end think that it would have been better to have left his childhood to our imagination."
2,A disappointing beginning to a disappointing conclusion...,"When I first began reading the Left Behind series, it was so rich with adventure, and really got me interested in the Bible and its teachings. Unfortunately, as time went on and the subsequent sequels released, I lost interest fairly quickly, but kept reading to find out what happened to the characters. The end of the series, 1/2 scripture 1/2 novel, was cheesy. But I figured since it was a prequel, it had a good shot of being pretty good. The writing was unprofessional and predictable (a family so religious it scares Rayford? go figure) and the character development actually had me disliking Rayford through most of the book. And the side-story of Nicolae's mother and Nicolae's birth and raising was really unnecessary. Overall, it felt like filler and now it's confirmed: they're going to milk as much wealth out of this series as they can, even if that means ruining it forever."
4,Il Barbiere,I really like Teresa Berganza but I wasn't wild about this particular production because it wasn't recorded live on a stage. It was more like a movie version ofIl Barbiere which I didn't know prior to purchasing the DVD. That aside it is still entertaining but if you are purchasing this to see the singers technique up close than beware because at times during the chorus scenes Berganza doesn't even look like she's singing but her voice is still heard in the ensemble. The only explanation I can think of is that they must have pre recorded many of the ensemble scenes so that the singers didn't have to sing the whole time only look as though they are singing. Order this if you don't care about those kind of things but I am a voice major and those sorts of things don't go by unnoticed.
2,Not useful for tourists,"First this book is rather large for travelling, but I picked it because it was the only one at the store that used English phonemes to show how to pronounce the words, which I need. The printing is very large, which can be useful, but I would have preferred smaller font and a smaller book. My biggest problem with this book is that it didn't have the words useful for travelling (such as reservation), which rendered it almost completely useless for me. It has an example sentence of how to use each word (I am no judge as to the correctness of these sentences), which probably would be useful for learning the language, but not to someone who just wanted to be able to get around Italy. If you are looking for a companion for travel, I've had good luck with the Cortina Dictionary Series (German and French). I definitely cannot recommend this book for travelling."
3,Transformers Make Chess Cool!,"My 13 year old son really enjoyed receiving the Transformers chess set for his birthday. My only disappointment was that the pieces were plastic rather than some sort of metal. It is neat that the pieces all have the traditional labels on their bottoms to help younger children learn the fundamentals of chess while having a cool & popular game to play. All-in-all, a good value for buyers."
3,Island View,"Surprising? I think not. A little ""Zappa-ish"", but also mostly inciteful and melancholy. Some say Mr. Yoho can't sing? The voice carries the lyric like peas and carrots. The horns/charts make it a perfect harmony. I might be biased-Knew Scott way back, or not so far back----his humor and sensitivity come through on this collection. One of the most productive and melodic cds I've listened to. A must for quirking, rollicking blusey/rnb."
2,Disappointed,"I didn't expect a Weed Eater or anything, but this trimmer can't even cut the fur between the pads on my dog's paws. Plus, it's noisy for the size, so she gets nervous whenever I turn the thing on, which doesn't happen with full-size clippers.On the other hand, it works well for trimming my around my sideburns..."
1,Too Old,The data in this book was too old for the newer areas we were traveling to. Many of the hotels and dog parks were not listed. They need a revised edition.
2,Disappointing,This one is not even close to his best and after reading everything he has put out with these characters this one leaves me a bit disapointed. The Prologue pretty much tells you what happens where you are going to end up once you get through the next 400 odd pages. Glitsky is hanging on to a desk job waiting for his pension and the partnership of Dismas and David Freeman is broken up.
3,What next?,"A good read, but the book makes you wonder what Lescroart can do next with his batch of characters. I'm betting the next book will feature new characters as this one would be hard to follow with just another story about Dismas and company."
3,Not the usual quality,"I really enjoy Mr. Lescroart's books so this one was a real disappointment. Hardy and Glitsky, normally full of character were just going through the motions in this book. Reading it was like walking through sludge instead of zipping through. Thats the problem with being excellent, good is not good enough."
2,A Disappointment,"Life was going well for Kent Anthony. He was happy married with a great son, and he had just finished the project of his career at work, which should earn him a multi-million dollar bonus. Out of the blue, his perfect world is slowly stripped away. While he goes about plotting his revenge, his mother-in-law Helen starts praying for his soul. But will her prayers be enough to reach Heaven?This book starts out very strong with some great writing, and I was quickly drawn into the story. However, part way through, it lost its way. After page 150, I had the basic plot figured out. Any surprises I figured out pages before they happened. And the climax was incredibly weak; it left me shaking my head instead of emotionally drawn in like I should have been.This book rates two stars because of it's great beginning. It's unfortunate that the rest of the book couldn't live up to the promise contained in those first pages."
4,A story that makes you think,"*Heaven's Wager* turns the account of Job on its ear to make the reader understand that we're all up against spiritual forces, regardless of who we are or who we believe in. Dekker takes us through the life of an unbelieving man who loses his wife, his son, and his fortune without at any moment making us feel the situation is overblown; instead you sympathize with a man who reacts in a human fashion, only to find in the end that his human frailties and failures mean little to a God who is desperate for his love."
3,Be careful of the company,"Full details are in the review below (it's long so I haven't copied it here. but in a nutshell, the wrong battery sent (supposedly larger but I get less runtime than promised), no responses to emails and inconsistent behavior of the battery all make me concerned for my investment if I have any kind of true failure.I definitely don't recommend BatteryGeek the company.Full reviews available at the blog on dragonseye.com"
4,"2009 Jim Collins book ""How the Mighty Fall"" is very similar","Both this 2004 Sydney Finkelstein book ""Why Smart Executives Fail"" and the 2009 Jim Collins book ""How The Mighty Fall: And Why Some Companies Never Give In"" carry a similar message, and even share several of the case studies.This 2004 Finkelstein book's chapters on ""Seven Habits of Spectacularly Unsuccessful People"" and the concluding ""How Smart Executives Learn"" are real gems. The 2007 Douglas Hubbard book ""How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business"" supplements the ""How Smart Executives Learn"" chapter by suggesting ways that top executives can be trained to more accurately assess risk.Jim Collin's table of ""Leadership Team Dynamics: On the Way Down versus On the Way Up"" is also particularly good.My conclusion would be that the (longer) Finkelstein book seems to include many more practical guidelines as to ways of fixing what is broken, rather than merely concentrating on how to detect what is broken."
3,"Fabulous movie, poor DVD quality.","5 stars for the movie which is phenomenal. 1 star for the DVD quality. The picture is quite blurry as if the transfer was done from a VHS recording of a TV showing. In spite of this, the viewing is still quite enjoyable due to the stunning visual qualities of the movie. I guess this DVD version is better than nothing. I found it available at moviesunlimited.com."
3,"Good, but I like the show better.","Like most reviewers, I saw the show first and decided to give the book a go. I usually don't read first person narratives or crime novels so I am somewhat biased against the style and genre. For most of the first half of the book, the first season of the show is remarkably similar. It's the second half of the book that is interesting and is different from the series. I won't give away any plot, but the differences might be worthwhile if you find yourself bored.I bought the second book at the same time as the first and am reading it now. I'm actually enjoying the second book a little more. Surprisingly, the second season of the show borrows a few ideas from the book. It's possible that the expectations I had for the first book or the knowledge of the plot spoiled it for me. Either way, it is a great concept and I love the show. Whether or not I continue the series depends largely on the second book.Overall, it's an easy, mostly enjoyable, read."
3,Meh....,"I have to applaud Jeff Lindsay for creating such an excellent character. There is a reason why a hit show has come out of this book. His creation of the character Dexter is the best thing that came out of these novels.However, each one seems to build painlessly slow with minimal plot development and it seems as though Mr. Lindsay got bored writing the book or realized he needed a paycheck and wraps everything up within the last 25 or so pages.I give him kudos for original characters. I'll probably still read the books, but I prefer Showtime's storytelling ability (and I NEVER say that)."
4,A Different Take on the Genre,"Dexter Morgan is no ordinary employee of the Miami Police Department. Yes, he comes to work every morning bearing breakfast for the staff, he lives in a normal apartment, and he even has a steady relationship with a woman. There is, however, a side to Dexter that none of his coworkers would ever expect. Dexter Morgan is a serial killer. In this novel by Jeff Lindsay, the reader is granted access to the mind of Miami's resident murderer. This inventive take on a serial killer is sure to delight readers, and have them rooting for the bad guy."
4,As Good as Sin,"An absorbing book of the specters of a sociopath's inner thinking. Portraying the inner thoughts of a ""sane person"" - should there be one - is hard enough, let alone do that for someone who is engulfed in darkness and emotionally frigidity. Having read this book, I unconsciously reviewed a mental list of the people I knew who might be Dexters-to-be around me!For the sake of argument if nothing more, one may claim that killing for ""justice"" is acceptable. Where does that put Dexter? The main reason Dexter kills is not to achieve justice, but to gain a bloody sense of satisfaction, and that disturbs me. The fact that I liked the book makes me uncomfortable. I'm afraid that little by little, we are idolizing the wrong figures for what we mistakingly perceive as the ""right reasons""."
5,Darkly Dreaming Dexter,"Great book, and an easy read, suprisingly different from the Showtime series."
1,So True that the Ending Ruins It,"Sure the book had some stereotypical characters, but it was breezy and a quick read and Dexter did have some interesting observations about people and life.But the ending WAS implausible. Almost a (excuse the pun) cop-out. Like the author was in a rush to end it.All along I was hoping the ending would be ~~~~~COULD BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER~~~~~ that Deborah knew about Dexter and was using her knowledge of her brother to set him up so that she could get a promotion.~~~~END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER~~~~ Did anyone else entertain this possibility?Maybe I should write this alternative ending."
4,Everything cool,The book was in good shape and I was promised it would arrive within 10-17 business days and it arrived in about 11... So all was fine however I wished it would have gotten here sooner.
1,Defective Paperback Edition! (Aug 2009 Mass Paperback),This August 2009 Mass Paperback edition(ISBN 978-0-307-47370-7) is actually missing pages 21 to 52!! Has extra pgs 293-324 in their place instead!! So weird and I'm sure that a lot of books could be affected. Returned my copy to Amazon and hoping for readable replacement.
2,Meh - Mostly Mediocre,"This is one of the rare cases where the TV show substantially outperforms the original material. I'm a fan of the Showtime series so I decided to pick up the book - bad idea. The writing is poor and the characterizations are thin to the point of transparency. Someone obviously saw the potential in this (admittedly, the concept of a serial killer preying on other serial killers is great) and turned it into a decent show, but the book was incredibly underwhelming. The show takes its time and fleshes out all the characters, while the book trots along at breakneck speed (and with twee prose) and wraps up unconvincingly. Ignore the book, watch the DVDs."
4,The Showtime Series is Better,"This book would probably be great had I not already seen the Dexter series on Showtime. The two are VERY similar. if you know what happens in the show, you will pretty much know what happens in the book. Also, I didn't find Dexter in the book to be as endearing as in the show. In the book, the character of Dexter is more one-dimensional. Michael C. Hall makes Dexter a very complex yet likeable character. In the book, Dexter is just cold and unrelateable. I probably won't read the next book in this series."
4,A Unique and Welcome Addition to the Mystery Genre,"Dexter is a charming, witty, attractive and successful blood splatter expert in Miami Florida. The perfect catch. Except he also happens to be a sociopath who occasionally veers off the road of sanity and dismembers someone. The plus side is that his victims are always the dregs of society; Child molesters, and monsters who prey on the innocent. So in devine retribution, Dexter preys on them. What makes this book stand out in a densely populted genre, is the voice of the charming and often hiliarious anti-hero. Showtime is developing this character for an original series starring 'Six Feet Under's' Michael C Hall, who just might be the perfect casting choice for this wonderfully witty and twisted character."
3,Darkly Dreaming Dexter,"Darkly Dreaming Dexter]]Great disappointment and over-priced on Kindle. It is a short story definitely should NOT be classified as a book. As a short story I would give it 3.5 stars, however I expected a book. Do not buy this on Kindle unless you have money to burn; it is not worth the price; buy it in used paperback books. I read ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"" in a couple of hours; it came to an end ~ I could not believe it. The 'very short story' was OK unless you have extra money to spend, or want it on Kindle; please buy this in used paperback. I will not buy another Dexter book - Jeff Lindsay, Author in Kindle. I may later much later pay used paperback 'Dexter' book by Jeff Lindsay.I truly hope you will read this and take it at face value ~~ it is a truthful evaluation."
5,Loved The Audiobook!,"What can I say that hasn't already been stating in the hundreds of other reviews? I really enjoyed the audiobook. Jeff Lindsay does his own reading, and does a wonderful job. You'd never know that narrating isn't his chosen profession. The book was entertaining and I was able to finish it in 1 day. I've watched the Showtime hit Dexter and also love that. So I'm not sure if that's why I loved the book so much. It makes it so much easier when you can put a face and personality to a book character. The book is just enough different from the show that it's still entertaining. Of course, I know the ""who done it"" already, but that didn't make a difference. I will be starting book 2 today!"
2,Entertaining but not Thrilling,"Darkly Dreaming Dexter is witty, entertaining, and at times outright hilarious. I enjoyed the humor, but the plot was predictable almost to the point of annoyance. I found the book to be more entertaining than mysterious."
3,Darkly Dreaming Dexter,"I am coming into these Dexter novels after having seen the HBO show, so I've already got an altered view of this series. I love the show and have heard great things about the novels. I can't say that I tried too hard to separate book from show, because it's hard. Jeff Lindsay has the hard task of making a serial killer into our protagonist, the hero, or anti-hero. Dexter is good and evil and book one is just barely scratching the surface. The tone was great, the pacing was pretty good, and it's interesting to be in Dexter's head. I like the side characters, though they weren't really prominent in this book since Dexter isn't really about the ancillary characters of his life. I enjoyed the story, but I wish I hadn't seen the show first because I knew what was going to happen, this book was really similar to Season 1 of Dexter. I think I'll continue with this series because I am interested to see what makes Dexter tick."
5,Love love love DEXTER!!!,i love the tv series and i extremely pysched bout reading the books. Yay!!!!! Books always give extra details. This is awesome!!!
5,True thriller,I began by watching the first 4 episodes of the series on Showtime and found it to be very entertaining. I decided that I would start the book series at the same time but why really happened is that I became obsessed and finished this book within 5 days. Dexter is such a complex character full of true insight on what it means to be a human. Nolan is to continue the series and once I am finished run a full Dexter the series marathon and see if it matches up to a good as the books. WAY TO GO JEFF LINDSAY!
5,Better than Expected,"I became addicted to the Dexter series on Showtime before I ever knew about these novels, but I am certainly glad I learned about the books so I could go back to square one. I was worried that I would already know the story too well and wouldn't enjoy reading this novel, but was I ever wrong. Even while making constant comparisons to the characters and plot of the tv show, I found Lindsay's book captivating and extremely well written. Even if gruesome murder mystery isn't typically your style, Dexter is really as likable as the review snip-its on the front of the book say. I am ordering the rest of the novels right now and already can't wait to see what happens next."
5,Pass the duct tape.,"This is the one that started it all. The first season of the hugely popular TV series was based on DDD. Will you like it if you love the series? Yea and perhaps nay. You'll like how delightfully warped and wonderfully hilarious Dexter is. You might be miffed that the secondary characters, so essential to the success of the TV version, receive short shrift in the novels. The books are all about the Big D. And in this instance, that's enough. It and the second book are the absolute best of the books to date. So if you're tempted to test the literary Dexter, by all means, DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER is right up your serial killer alley."
2,Bored out of my tree!!,"Okay - I have never not finished a book before sending a review - but what is up with this book?! This was reviewed in Time Magazine as a ""must read"". PLEASE! I was expecting a fabulous sinister dark scary delicious novel. I am instead finding silly childish writing that is boring me to tears. What happened? The only reason I am even giving it 2 stars at mid novel is that ""Dexter"" can be occasionally funny. Not sure if I will even finish this book.Man - what a disappointment."
4,Very Entertaining Read,"This book is very entertaining. Having watched the show first and going back and read the book, I can see how the show creators saw a robust character and ran with it. If you have not seen the show, it will be entertaining with a great amount of character development. If you have, you will notice the show is true to the book to a point and then takes a different direction. Either way, it will keep you guessing until the very end on what happens to Dexter."
5,Grabbing and filled with morbid curiosity,"This book grabs you from the beging and doesn't let go. It's a great escapist novel, with not much pandering towards methephor and symbolism, but still great! The only serial killer novel to grab me in a long time, the first I acctually think I would read again or read more off."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"Snarky Television show? Yes. Worthy of a quick read? Not so much.I picked Dexter up as an ""airplane book"" - i.e. a few hours of brainless reading. Unfortunately, the suspension of disbelief required to stick with this for a few hours was a bit too much. Dexter tries just a little too hard, and the jumps in logic are just a little too far to make this a book you want to follow."
5,a fan of both Dexters I love that they differ.,I watched this series before I read this book. I am a fan of both! I love the idea of Dexter. All the characters are amazing to get to know and fall in love with. Thank you Jeff Lindsay for being so creatively genius! And the books are different from the tv. Series but I love both. Its not a bad thing at all!
1,WORST EVER.,"I was so disappointed. I pounced on this book hungrily, couldn't WAIT to read it.My problems with it:Boring and repetitive. Barely a shell of the show, hardly a good read. I had to force myself through it. I honestly don't see why they decided to make this into a show, I guess it was a pretty good decision since the show is so freaking amazing but yeah, the book is riddled with poor writing that could have been fixed with a good editor. Words are used over and over again and gives the impression that the author has a really poor grasp on writing. It really seems like Deb blushes every other page, it disgusts me. The book plays on her sexuality in a way that just makes me feel like a huge creep. Things that were gasp-worthy in the show are diminished and played down in the novel. The ending was likewise poor, I felt that the people who adapted this for the show did a stellar job of cleaning up a messy novel. Would Never Read Again. Anyone want my copy?"
3,Delicious Chocolate,"The Emperors of Chocolate is a good book for the kind of person that really loves to eat it, and would be intrested in finding out how two small businesses that made candy became two large successful company's. The Forest Mars and the Milton Hersheys were two very successful business but each one thought differently. Forest Mars was always thinking about new ideas and taking advantage of that but Hersheys always thought the perfect everything, in other words he always thought aboutit as a utopia. I really enjoyed reading this book and others would say the same."
4,"Great, but getting dated...","There is no doubt that this is nothing short of a fantasic book. It's a very fast, fascinating read. It's especially interesting if you're interested in business, and some of the inside secrets of successful businesses. The other reviews on this board should be enough to convince anyone to buy this book.My only complaint? Since it was written in 1998, the business world has changed a lot. It would be very interesting to see how Hershey and Mars have handled the last four years, and that's not covered at all. This book is in need of an update, and it's disappointing that there seems to be none forthcoming.Like good chocolate, it leaves you wanting more..."
3,Chocolate,"I too read this book for my economics class. Who knew there was a battle between chocolate companies? My favorite part of the book was when they were talking about the chocolate rations in soldiers backpacks during the Gulf War and World War 2 and how they had to come up with chocolate that could withstand a high temperture. Too bad they cannot make chocolate like that for civilans.As much as I found the information intersting and I also found the book boring which is why I only gave it three stars. Maybe three was too generous. The secrets are intersting but the writing was dull.If you plan on reading this book, have a package of Hershey kisses by your side. You will need them."
5,As satisfying as your favorite chocolate indulgence,"Ranks with the great business books of the last twenty years. An in- depth history of the Mars and Hershey empires, the history of chocolate and the personalities that created these great companies. The sucesses and mistakes astound, the basic goodness of Milton Hershey, his benevolence to his workers and his town and his ultimate unhappiness in losing the love of his life at a young age gives a great feeling of a man and time. The arrogance, power hunger and rigidity of the Mars family will make you wince, and remind you of the worst boss you ever had (especially the one who pays 30-40% above the industry average). Absolutely fascinating, a book you can't put down."
3,My Review,The Emperors of Chocolate made my mouth water as i was reading it. It was very detailed and descriptive. The competition between the two companies was very dramatic and it captured my attention.
5,Engrossing and almost edible,"I read the reviews of this book in the NYT book review and agree with their evaluation. It was a good read (entertaining, well-paced, kept my attention) and fun, in spite of some of the business philosophy stuff. The biographies are fascinating (Milton Hershey in particular) as are the candy/chocolate development stories. Five stars from a non-business person."
4,For Jimenez....,The Emperors of chocolate really shows the history and corporate side of Hershey and mars. Before I read this book i didnt know very much about mars at all. I knew Hershey's for there trademark Chocolate bar but mars was a mystery. this book showed me why I didnt know much about mars. they are a secretive company. A very good book if you are into the rise of corporations.
2,An Insider View,"Please spare me the research aspects of all thats been written before. You understand little of the inside workings of Mars, especially the insights of Forrest Sr. This book contains the known cream, but little of the substantive ""meat"". Few will ever really know Mars, or how it works, and unfortunately this author is one of these. To know Mars, to work for the company, is to know the consumer, as the consumer is key to the success, Little new light is shed on the shadow known as Mars in this diatribe."
5,"Reads like a novel, but fact-filled and well researched.","Ms. Brenner's extensive research is brought together in a most delicious way in this story of the Mars and Hershey families and companies. The soap-opera of their lives, interwoven for years, and the mysteries of the chocolate world make for very interesting, easily-digested reading."
2,Whatttt???,"Pleaaassee. I can not rationalize why Francine Pascal would ressurrect the annoying William White. He is not terrifying, disturbing, or even disarming. He is lame. He is also dead. Period. I wish the thrillers had somewhat of a plot connection to the regular books, but they never do. You just have to ride them out. This book is preposterous, and not even entertaining. And there is a sequel. Oh boy. Anyway, I dont recommend this. I was disappointed the first time William White came back, now its just annoying. Surely the author can imagine a new antagonist, and a new set of circumstances. This book was very disappointing. I cant wait until March."
3,Almost good enough!,"The only problem with this press is that the plunger parts are not only fragile, they are not available for replacement (except the screen). I owned mine for two years, but only used it about 4-5 times/month and the plastic piece that holds the rubber seal, crumbled into pieces. To be labeled ""unbreakable"", it should really be built better.To extend the life, I would recommend to use only the larger grind and push down very, very slowly on the plunger. It's cheap, effective but not very durable."
2,Not worth the $,"Many other reviewers have stated that the plunger is poorly made. I totally agree. The first one we bought broke in less than 3 months. I called the company and they sent me a replacement for free. That one lasted only slightly longer, but wasn't used nearly as much...It was the plunger that broke both times. It is very poorly made plastic and it WILL break no matter what you do....find another press to buy..."
2,"BonJour Hugo 8-Cup Unbreakable French Press, Black","Nice idea but poorly executed. The press is difficult to use, coffee grains seep through the filter gasket and cleaning is almost impossible."
1,Filter assembly broke after light use,"The Bodum brand is more expensive, but in the end worth the extra cost.The french press itself was fine, but the build quality is fairly cheap. If you disassemble the filter head to clean out the screen you will notice that the screen itself and the housing are cheap and thin feeling.After using mine about twice a week for two months the filter assembly broke into about 5 pieces and now the press is basically useless. Good luck finding a replacement part on the BonJour website, and from the looks of other reviews here no one else has had any luck.Pay more for the Bodum and get what you pay for"
1,"Awful product, awful customer service","I bought this product approximately 2 months ago and the screen housing is already broken. I first attempted to email the manufacturer via their website, but the ""Send"" button was mysteriously disabled...from 2 different PCs! Imagine that!I then attempted to call the 800 number listed on their website, and each time I got to the last selection where I might get an actual person, their system hung up on me.I'll be replacing this product with a Bodum, which I should have purchased in the first place."
3,Doesn't fit in my microwave,I bought this so I could put it in the microwave. But it doesn't fit. Otherwise it's a nice French press.
4,BonJour Hugo,"Bought this to supplement a Stainless Steel unit we use from ""Next Day Gourmet"" (apparently no longer available). This one is obviously not quite as substantial but works fine for our needs. The top on the BonJour doesn't lock on like our other unit but other than that we're satisfied with the performance."
2,What a disapointment,"Makes great coffee some times. If one is not very careful, the coffee will shoot out the top when you press the plunger and scald the coffee maker! Even with the little tab turned to block the spout, has an unbreakable flask yet the inside press part just broke apart after one month. JUNK"
3,Works well,"This french press works very well and is unbreakable. It washes easily and holds enough coffee for the morning. The only downside for me was that it is plastic.""Therefore, Power does not in any way differ from Thought, they being One. From the things above is found Power, and from those below Thought."""
1,Very Breakable,"The unbreakable claim proved to be entirely unfounded. Through an ordering mishap we ended up with two presses. Although the press body undoubtedly withstands normal wear, the plastic press portion is made of very cheap plastic. The first one broke in the wash. I replaced it with the other one, thinking it was a fluke, and adopted the practice of swishing the press in the wash water instead of putting a cloth to it. This practice similarly place too much strain on the plastic retaining the screen, and the replacement broke within two weeks. The worst press I have ever had. I also suspect that the plastic leaches into the boiling water - but that's another post entirely. Do not buy this item."
1,breakable,Been using it for less than 2 months now and there is a leak from the bottom. The cost to ship the item back under warranty is just about as much as buying another one. not worth it
1,Read Reviews and believe!,"Yes, I read the reviews but I was not going to buy another Bodium and have that darn carafe break again. The one thing I have learn is not to review a product for at least a month. Here it is a month and one day and this prduct did exactly what other people said it did. The assembly cracked and fell apart. This product is not well made and will not hold up under normal usage. In other words it is a piece of junk!"
3,I have 2 in my house that are broken,"While the press stays together, it does a good job. But it is so cheaply made, that might not be for long. My last one, which broke today, lasted barely through two months.(Please note company quickly replaced my two broken French presses with four. That might have been a mistake, but I'm not complaining. They've got my business for life.)"
3,Not Unbreakable,"We have had many French Press coffee makers and always it was the glass that broke. We loved the idea of an unbreakable coffee press, but while the ""glass"" cup is living on, I have had to glue and re-glue the screan and press part. The ""press"" part of the French press is definately not UNBREAKABLE!"
1,This Product Won't Last,"I purchased this French Press May 13 2009, and the plastic frame for the screen has already broken into several pieces. I only got to use it for 6 weeks. I make coffee every day, but I took good care of it- cleaning after every use and ensuring proper storage. I think it must be that the plastic they use to make the frame simply can not hold up to the heat of the water when brewing and straining. It literally crumbled in my hands, I never even dropped it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you want your money's worth!"
2,Fell Apart in Less Than 30 Days,"Careful, occasional use and mine fell apart in the same way it did in the customer photo. I am buying a different press to replace it."
3,A decent french press for the money,"I bought this item primarily for frothing milk for espresso drinks. Unfortunately, it is a bit too big for individual portions so I ended up also buying a Bodum 3 cup French press. I like Bodum's designs much better.This one will probably end up languishing alone in the back of a cabinet somewhere, but it will be useful for entertaining."
1,shipped wrong item,I purchased this as a gift. A month later i find out they shipped a 4 cup press. They probably won't use it. Bummer!
3,"the ""unbreakable"" broke","Plastic press, cracked after 6 uses. Going to give them a chance to replace and see if maybe it was just a mfg defect. it made great coffee, and was very easy to clean."
1,Definitely Breakable + Poor Customer Service,"I had my press for a year until a rubber gasket on the plunger/screen assembly broke. I figured why not contact Bonjour to see if I could get a replacement lid & spindle. Their customer service wrote back and said in 7-10 days I'd have a new replacement press. What SERVICE, I thought! Fast forward 3+ weeks and nothing's arrived, nor is there a response when I try to ask for an update on this.Good at setting promises (""unbreakable French Press"", you will get a replacement unit).Bad on promise delivery (uh, breakable French Press, no replacement unit, no follow-up contact).I try to stay away from writing negative reviews, but this one really gets me. One star."
2,Plunger is crap,"Note that only the carafe is claimed to be unbreakable. The Bonjour plunger, on the other hand, disintegrated after fewer than a dozen uses. That is unacceptable.Until someone builds a more durable French Press, I have mated the surviving Bonjour carafe with one of my orphaned Bodum plungers."
1,Screen hold assembly broke,"Works ok as a coffee press. However, we only used about a dozen times when the part that holds the screen to the press broke apart. So, not quite unbreakable. The manufacture does not sell or offer replacement parts! What a waste."
1,"Misleading picture, clear glasses no Guinness Logo","The image posted in Amazon.com clearly shows a couple of classic tulip Guinness glasses (With Guinness Logo) but I received a couple of plain clear (No Logo) glasses. The point was the logo! thats what makes these glasses cool to use them in you home bar, huge disappointment, seller should inform you that they sell clear no logo glasses..."
3,A Mediocre Read,"The author is overdoing what was initially a good thing. The characters are poorly developed other than their now being older. There are quite a few chapters that appear to be merely fluff and to little to aid in the progression of the story. The plot line is all too familiar as Marlene gets into trouble, Lucy stays funky, Zak and Giancarlo get into their usual boyishpranks and Fearless Butch, like Mighty Mouse, arrives to save the day. The story just plods along without the direction that is usually expected in a really good read. The proofreading is not well done and the story travels far from would pass for reality."
4,Detailed and pretty interesting,"This book is incredibly informative. I often re-read sections because you cannot absorb all the information at once. Robinson's writing is clear, but sometimes the details (especially the history sections) are dry. I think of this as almost a text book but a readable text book with great pictures!"
3,Makes You Sweat,I like the simple exercises to tighten the tummy and booty. The naked ladies are actually pretty rigerous. The most I've seen women move in a long time. Good exercises.
2,Poor quality but good for a laugh,"I would have given this one star, but watching the one girl who can't do any of the exercises is pretty funny. She's completely inept, and I don't know how she got chosen. I guess she was willing to be filmed nude, so that was good enough. Otherwise, this video is (poor). The lighting is horrible and the camera angles are bad. Very amateurish. Definitely recommend Totally Nude Aerobics over this one. That video is much higher quality, has better looking women, and they all can do the exercises. The only problem (well, only a problem depending on how you look at it) with that one is that there are a lot of close-ups and no instruction, so if you're actually looking for an aerobics tape, you'll be out of luck. But I don't think the main audience is actually looking for an exercise video."
1,No redeeming social value,"This DVD is not an exercise video nor is it an erotic video The models or demonstrators, whichever you wish to call them, are not what you would call pleasing to the eyes. They are definitely not model material and not very good at demonstrating the exercises, this video was thrown together in an attempt make money with little or no effort at quality. I feel every cent I spent on this DVD was wasted. My reason for buying this DVD was for erotica and I was disappointed."
3,Fair,"A good insight in to living in Alaska, It did have a tendency to drag somewhat. Over all I would give it a fair rating."
2,Last Chapter saved it from 1 star,"This was one of the worst books I've read in the past 5 years. I was given this book and thought it would be tales about life in Haines, Alaska. The first chapter and last chapter were the only worthwhile chapters in the book IMO. Ive been to beautiful Haines and was hoping to read tales about the wildlife and natural beauty, instead I got a book about people dying. Death and the author's religious beliefs were too much for me. Again and again while reading this I thought why do I care? Imagine writing about 30 people that died in your town over the years and tell about how they died, what they did for a living, and then making a reference to God that is this entire book. I cannot believe that this was published. Alaska is not a main theme in this book and it could easily be set in any small town on the water in America. I can't recommend this, but if you ever have a chance to visit Haines jump on it."
4,True adventure,Thank you Heather for a fun read... I loved the obits... I read local obits for stories on people in my community... you gave us a real feel of people in a small community... It got me thinking how all communities have people with wonderful stories... You took hold of a wonderful opportunity to give all of us a true adventure in a place not many of us will ever visit.
2,"Haines, Alaska, R.I.P.","After finishing this book I felt like I had just watched an episode of ""Seventh Heaven"", something I don't particularly recommend. Heather Lende writes like a minister's wife: everyone is basically good and kind; don't make waves; make hubby feel like a man while he kills a billy-goat; the joy of small things, like smoking your own salmon, running marathons in between numerous pregnancies, adopting a Bulgarian orphan when things get slow......Everything is so wonderful in Haines, Alaska, I smacked my forehead in frustration---I coulda lived there! No alcoholism, no drugs, no despair, I don't think there's any cursing, either.I guess as an obituary writer Lende feels it is her job to clean up and sanitize the mess of life, but in book length?In fact, this account reads like one big obituary of a small town in Alaska-- a pleasant, uncontroversial bromide for the living."
5,"if you read this book, you won't forget heather lende's name","alaskan author heather lende's book, ""if you lived here, i'd know your name"" is everything a good read should be. one feels, after reading it, fully acquainted with the author, her family and the little town of haines, alaska, and all of the townspeople therein of whom she writes.she pulls out all the stops in the last chapter; tears were streaming down my cheeks. i will recommend this book to everyone i know and already have a list of folks i am going to pass my copy to.marilyn blumer"
4,"Good Durable bag for D70 + 18-70mm, but snug","Strong bag, durable with lots of pockets for extra batteries, cards, and remotes. The bag is slightly snug, and fits a D70 and a 18-70mm lens with some, but little wiggle room. Great bag to carry around for a light photographing trek out."
3,Great For Beginning Non Seirous Photographers,This bag was perfect until I bought more equipment for my camera than it soon couldn't fit everything I needed to bring to a shoot or on my travels. So I had to update my bag.
5,Great product,I bought this bag for my Fuji S6000fd. It fits perfectly. This is a tough little bag with a well thought out design.When a company is willing to put it's name on a zipper they mean for it to last.I wouldn't hesitate a second to recommend this bag or give it as a gift.
3,"Skim it for the ideas, skip the fiction","I particularly enjoyed straight essays such as ""Vehicles for Future Wars"", especially the section on the feasibility of vehicular evasion of orbital lasers. He's done the numbers, has a great argument I'd not heard. The discussion of the implications of increasing payload fraction was interesting, too.However, as much as I tried, I couldn't bring myself to finish the short stories. I read several, couldn't bring myself to finish the rest."
5,Quality and Flavour,"I'm not a tea snob, but I drink a lot of tea--this six pack lasts me about six months, and I get through a pound of English Breakfast each month--and I like a decent quality. Mostly, I don't like ""flavoured"" teas (can't handle Earl Grey), but this tea has a delicious smokey flavour that I really enjoy. Sometimes I cut it with 50% English Breakfast. Of course Taylor's is a respected upper mid range brand (not quite ""boutique"" but I wouldn't be willing to spend that much money on a tea for everyday drinking), so it shouldn't be any surprise that this one is good too."
2,SUPER HEAVY DUTY TARP,I used this tarp to cover a hot tub . The tub has an insulating foam cover and sits next to my house on a patio. It was exposed to the full sun for about 4-6 hours a day. I was hoping for at least a year of use out of a tarp of this weight. Within 6 months the tarp had started to flake apart and the seams started to separate.This may be a good tarp for some use but not for full exposure to the sun.
2,Mine broke too,"After a few months of use, the plastic holder for the metal filter on the press itself broke, very similar to the other reviewer's photos. Unbelievable."
1,JUNK!,"Piece of you-know-what. don't buy it. the entire screen/mesh mechanism on mine broke within a month of daily use. great that the carafe is unbreakable, but the rest breaks pretty easily. I laughed when I read the rest of the reviews! So true! Save yourself some time, spend $20 more and get a Bodum."
4,French Press,"Fast shipping; thought it would be a little bigger, but that was probably my fault rather than the sellers"
3,3-cup is misleading,"3 cup is misleading, I don't know what form of measurement this is, I could barely fit 1.5 cup. Am I using the wrong measure? but other than the size, since it's made of plastic, it's very hard to break, so if you are a clutz like I am, this is a perfect french press for you but I would buy a one size bigger..."
2,mislabeled product,"I ordered this product thinking this was as the description says; ""Bonjour Hugo 3-cup Unbreakable French Press"".Although I agree, it is indeed made of a durable plastic; the carafe can be barely called a single cup. I measured the actual amount of water it can hold, and I was able to get 12 ounces with a 1/4 inch to spare under the brim.This french press is in no way shape or form is a 3-cup french.I wish I didn't buy it, and / or I wish Amazon will offer me a real 3-cup french press that makes (3) 8-ounce cups of coffee."
1,"Breakable, Not Microwaveble",The bottom broke and the rubber boot almost melted when I first used it in microwave. They say its unbreakeable and microwaveable if lid and metal parts are removed. I followed the instruction and I ended up with a broken bottom.
2,"unbreakable carafe, breakable components","I've had mine for about a month and the ring around the screen on the plunger has already come off and doesn't appear to want to go back on. In general, I think the screen/plunger piece does not fit well and lets a lot of air (and grounds!) pass through the ring, no matter how slowly or carefully you press down the plunger.This may be okay for camping trips since the carafe seems very durable, but I do not recommend this for daily home or office use. In fact, this weekend I'll be shopping for a larger and less cheaply built glass coffee press in a brick-and-mortar store.This unit is also very small. If I fill it to capacity I can almost make enough coffee to fill my standard-sized coffee mug."
1,Lousy,"Through a gift ordering glitch I ended up with two of these. Within two weeks the plastic ring around the plunger broke, one while washing, the other while swishing in rinse water. Not worth the wasted resources."
2,3 Cups???,"This coffee press does what it is supposed to do, for the most part. You can make coffee with it, but I have concerns about the measuring device(s) used to get 3 Cups. When I opened the package, I couldn't imagine three cups of coffee came from such a tiny press. So, I measured the pour and only 1 cup of coffee came out (1 US cup = 236.588237 milliliters). Since it is a ""one cup at a time"" press, do I only get three full cups and then have to throw it away and order another? The instructions do not tell you how to obtain three cups of coffee from this press. The instructions outside say use 3 scoops of coffee grounds. The instructions inside say to use 1 scoop (per cup). I measured only one cup, but the box says 3 cups. Do I use old grounds to get my next two cups? Ew... So, how did the manufacturer get three cups?? I was expecting a press that made three cups of coffee in one brew."
3,Smaller Than 3 Cups,"This was advertised as a 3-cup press, but at four ounces per cup, each cup is tiny. I like one big mug of coffee in the morning, but the size of this thing wasn't enough to fill even that as it makes 12 ounces maximum. Although cute and compact with a good filtration system, I was expecting something a little bit bigger so I returned it for a bigger one. I was fairly well made and easily washable. Unless you like tiny cups of coffee and making them frequently, buy a bigger press."
2,Hugo 3-cup French Press Review,"This particular coffee making apparatus works well, and even makes a decent cup of joe. However, I was quite disappointed when I first opened the box to find a french press a little smaller than my 15 oz. coffee cup.Now, for a press that makes 1 cup, not the unit of measurement, it has its ups and downs. Ups being: you don't exactly need to share and if anyone wants a cup of their own they will have to make it themselves.Downs being: You only get one cup of coffee for your efforts."
1,A badly designed product. The company should be ashamed,Making the center plunger with plastic is just crazy. I bought two and they both deteriorated in 4 months using it once a day. I've finally gotten smart and am using the all metal Bodum press.
5,You need to know how to use it ...,"This is a well-made product, and especially great after I broke my third glass one!For those who complain about the size ... it does say pretty clearly in the description that this is three 4 oz. cups. The reason is that it's designed for making coffee in the French manner, which will produce much better coffee than you're used to. Here's how you do it:1. Put twice as many grounds in the container as you're used to. I usually use two Tbsp. coarse ground coffee per 8oz., so for this little one 3 Tbsp.2. Pour the hot water in, let steep for four minutes.3. Press, and pour your coffee.4. If you're a long-haul trucker or want hair on your back, drink it straight. Otherwise, cut it as much as 2:1 with hot milk (for a cafe au lait) or hot water.5. Laugh at all the schmucks who think you need to pay $4 for a cup of coffee.Incidentally, you can heat the milk by steaming it, although that's not technically an au lait."
1,unbreakble but breakable,"First I liked this press - good coffee, reasonable price.But in 3 weeks operation, the press itself has already broken. The plastic holder for mesh filter has broken...May be this pres is good for ones a year usage, but not for everyday..."
2,The others are right,"The plastic carafe is not a bad idea. Unbreakable. The taste of the coffee is also good (initially I was afraid of a taste of plastic in my coffee). But the filter retainer broke and fell apart after 3 month daily use, making this ""unbreakable"" product useless. Wont buy it again. In average my glass Bodums lasted much more than one year (before someone accidently dropped it)."
2,The carafe is unbreakable...,"...insofar as you'll break the plunger first. I've had this happen twice: once after a year and once after 3 months of daily use. It's also worth mentioning that the mesh is finer on the good glass/stainless steel variety of french press, meaning less sediment if that sort of thing bothers you."
3,Cracking Problem,"The unbreakabke container developed two very thin cracks near the bottom. I may have put it in the Microwave one time, but I doubt it. In any event, the item carries no Microwave warning. Other than that, I like the product and may get another, larger one. John Vogel.BonJour Hugo 3-Cup Unbreakable French Press, Black"
4,"Good, but overpriced","These are comfortable and stay that way. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't improve MY sex life, like some of the other reviewers claim, but, maybe that's just me. These will feel better as you forget how much you paid for them...."
5,OH MY DEAR!!!,"UPDATE: They were riding up way too much, went for the same ones in the boxer brief and I couldn't be happier.OH MY DEAR!!! I have been wearing lulu lemon underwear... don't judge, a friend who works for them gave me a $200 gift certificate... they are some seriously comfortable underwear. But after getting teased from girlfriends and best buds whenever they would see the lulu lemon label I knew it was time for a change. I thought the lulu lemons were the most comfortable thing ever, boy was I wrong... these are AMAZING. At $20 a pair they aren't cheap, but hey underwear usually last for a really long time. I'm a 31 waist, and ordered a medium... I should have gone with a small probably though and will be ordering that in the future. You will definitely love these!"
3,They don't really fit like they should,These underware are Kinda tight in places and kinda baggy in other places. It's not a great cut. But OK.
4,"Excellent fit, feel, appearance","One more customer, echoing same comments as previous buyers:-Shocked at price, but purchased based on customer reviews-Fantastic fit. Not droopy or saggy-Extremely comfortable, softer than cotton-Looks great, not like tighty whities-Four, not five stars, because durability is not proven yet"
2,"Not worth the price, not even close!","I've worn these trunks now several times and found them completely underwhelming in terms of fit, feel/comfort and construction compared to Hanes, as well as several off-brands picked-up at Target and Wal-Mart priced $20 less! And although I've only washed them a few times so far, based on the material thickness they seem less durable. The only way I would possibly ever consider paying this price again is if they last like 25 years... I'll let you know :-)..."
4,Not too sweaty...very comfortable.,"The problem with sandals that are closed toed is that they make your feet sweat, and when the sweat gets into the man-made material, it cause bacteria to grow and then the stench starts. It is the worst smell I have ever encountered and nothing would get it out of the sandals. I washed them, soaked them in vinegar, baking soda and anything else i knew would take out the smell and kill the bacteria. And my poor kids, every time they took off their shoes everyone would start making faces. I would wash their feet with soap and they would still smell. These sandals are a bit more open on its sides so i hope we will avoid the problem. so far so good....but they have only worn them 4 times and the real hot weather has not come yet. So we will see."
3,not going to take a chance on these,"The color was a bit more gray than it looked in the picture on my computer, where they had a more navy & gold look. They are just a little more dull than I expected. The main problem was that the straps caught in the plastic rings/buckles right where the velcro begins (where the straps become two layers thick) so when I tried to open them to make room to slide my son's foot in, I had to work the thick part through the rings. Over time, I am concerned this will cause the velcro to separate from the strap, especially when my son puts them on. He won't take the time to work the velcro through but will use brute force to get his feet in. I'm returning them before I find out for sure if this is going to be a problem. Other than that, they could have been decent shoes, but I'll never know for sure."
4,"Fabulous shoe, very comfy but makes feet smell","I bought these for my 7 yr old daughter - she loved them from the very start. They were so comfy that she would wear them instead of any other shoe. She would wear them day and night if she could, and that's what she did for a while. But then we noticed that her feet REALLY stink after wearing them. She does not have this problem with any other shoes or sandals. Tried washing the shoes, but it did not make a lot of difference. So she has now swapped to another pair of sandals, and her feet smell just fine. Also, after a few months the front bit (where the big toe goes) is starting to come apart. A little disappointing.Overall, still the most comfortable sandals she has ever owned, and she still loves them, but cannot wear them as often as she would like to."
4,Snug as a bug in my little rug,"I got the medium size over the large because I wanted a bag that would take up as little room in my range bag.I use it for a HK UPS 40 S&W full size and it is a tight fit but it fits.The inner lining is very padded so it will form fit around the pistol later but closing it now is not hard but another 1/2 inch in height for the gun it would be no good.I also have a Berreta PX4 9mm Full Size and that fits snug also.If you have any extended magazines for these ,the rug would be too small.The problem with the rug is it height not lenght.Hope this helps;nice rug for the price,if you own a handgun you should keep it in a rug to keep it nice.Update:I posted a couple of pictures to give you an idea of the size and how padded this rug is."
2,"Sound ok, but headphones too tight","I liked the quality of construction and materials and having the shorter attached cord for use with an iPod plus the extension for use with the amplifier was nice. Sound in the mid and upper registers was nice - smooth and spacious - but the lower register was muddy and reverberant. The biggest problem was the tightness of the headband. After 30 minutes, my ears hurt! I had read about this in other reviews, but since I have a small head I thought this would not be a problem. It was!"
2,weeds-season three,"Show is good, disk kept freezing on the third and forth disk. Clean my player but the problem continue."
5,Good fun great show great writing,"This is a great show that is good fun to watch, especially with others who don't take life so seriously. This is great writing season after season. I expect each season to become more developed as we get to know the characters (or it would be boring). If you love dark comedy, have a sophisticated sense of humor you will have a good time watching the whole series. To the rest, you need to lighten up! That is the point of satire after all...taking chunks of reality and putting them over the top for a good laugh."
1,Weeds Season 3,"We are somewhat disappointed, and need to return for another set. One of the discs(Disc 2)keeps coming up ""Bad Disc""... very frustrating!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Paid too much for this in October 2010!,"I like this brush I bought from Amazon on October 22, 2010, but I paid $77.60 for it and it is priced at $70.68 here. Why is that?"
1,"crass, jackass spumes about that of which he knows naught.",I didn't make it up- it's on the book jacket. Only a complete dunce would be blind to this tome's innumerable inconsistencies. Tripe. Pure and Simple. You are warned.
4,Not as one-sided as the previous review would make you believe,"The previous reviewer casually accuses McWhorter of being a cultural elitist, and to some extent that is the case. However, if you actually read the book with an open mind, instead of coming to it with prejudices about cultural relativity, you'll find that McWhorter's arguments are much more subtle than they're presented in the previous review, which boils the two positions down to either appreciating the western canon or appreciating all art and language.Personally, I found this to be a decent read that gave me a decent amount to think about. I'd rate it a 3.5."
5,Outstanding reference book on matte painting,"The Invisible Art by Craig Barron and Mark Cotta Vaz is without question the definitive reference text on the fascinating art form of matte painting. Lavishly illustrated with B&W and color photos, The Invisble Art chronicles the history and present digital technology of creating matte paintings for films ranging from the silent era, and up through present-day filmmaking. I could not put the book down, and read every word and feasted on every photo. This book is a must-have for anyone even remotely interested in film production, and how one can save millions of dollars in production costs by using matte paintings and/or hanging miniatures to expand the scope and spectacle of a film's art direction and set design. Film producers especially should read this book."
2,very dim,"I was under the impression this would be bright enough to help my wife if she needed a light on our car keys, it's small but, it's very dim. (Maybe I just got a bad one)."
5,"""Covert nose"" is brilliant.","I've had one of these little buggers on my keychain for about 7 years now. I've only had to change the batteries once. (I obviously don't use it a lot)I can tell you that the little ""covert"" nose shroud that wraps around the sides of the LED is a fantastic idea. I've got a Princeton Tec Impulse as well, (which is another good light, unlike the crappy fragile Pulsar), and using it, you see the bright light spilling from the side of the LED. It kinda ruins your night vision. The little shroud on this one keeps all of that light covered, yet doesn't obscure the light coming out the front at all. You only see what you're lighting up, not the light itself. Brilliant, wonderfully simple idea. Don't know why everybody doesn't do that.Other note, I really have ever only used two modes. Full-on, and the fast strobe, just to create that disco effect for laughs. P-)Great little light, very durable. The Photon with the ""covert nose"" is the one to get."
4,the best,"Oliver Mtukudzi takes you to places that other artist only dream of taking you to. I have three other cds from Oliver and they are all great, nhava is a very upbeat and uplifting album. Every track is a winner."
1,Worst Intro Econ Book in the World!!!,"First of all, this is really a poor text for students who are taking Intro Macro course. That guy doesnt explain and clarify those concepts well, and his examples are ambigious and annoying as well! To a college student, a concise text is more appreciated than a massive one, which contains many unnecessary sentences. Plus, his writing is so poor! He just wants to make it interesting, instead is really dry!I am so mad about my Econ prof who chose to use this text, Mankiw's Econ books are more preferable!"
1,Dreary snooze fest,"If you cannot sleep at night, here is the sleeping pill you were looking for. Besides its dreary nature - one who struggles with concepts as they relate to graphing will certainly be frustrated."
5,"To be used with the author's ""Persian Grammar.""","This book is not intended to be used by itself, but as an accompaniment to the author's ""Persian Grammar"" and it must be considered in this light. Students or reviewers who are unaware of this may be disappointed.Lambton's grammar is one of the two best currently available for Persian (the other is that of Thackston Wheeler). This vocabulary complements its exercises and readings."
3,Persian Vocabulary,"The strengths of this book are its phonetic notation, size and reasonable choice of vocabulary. It's a lot handier than bigger dictionaries, but unfortunately lacks many words one comes across in newspapers, poems, etc. It's certainly worth owning!"
1,Why bother?,"This book is entitled ""Persian Vocabulary,"" however ""Persian Wordlist"" would be a more appropriate title. I would much rather own a dictionary than this book. After having studied more languages than I can count and combing through books both valuable and worthless I believe that, at least for someone who learns languages the way that I do, this book would not help much. Why doesn't someone write a book with vocabulary learning techniques in mind? If the auther were to take a tenth of the vocabulary in this book and present it in an interesting, easy to learn format such a book would be well worth purchasing."
2,Pass on this one,"I must have ordered this thinking it was one of the Big 100 Colossal bars, which have all been fantastic. I haven't tried a flavor of those I haven't enjoyed. These are a poor substitute. The flavor is incredibly artificial and nowhere near either chocolate chip or graham cracker. Where it missed the mark, it landed somewhere between too salty and too sweet. The texture was another major sticking point for me. It somewhat resembled the feel of raw cookie dough, or perhaps more accurately, silly putty.Pass on the Big 100 line entirely and go straight to the Big 100 Colossal. They cost about the same, but you'll actually enjoy all 12, rather than eating the first two and leaving the rest in the break room at work."
4,Granddaughter likes it,I have a 5 year old granddaughter going through her Barbie phase. Bought her this movie as a gift and she likes it. Thus so do I. Her favorites however remain Barbie and The Three Musketeers and Barbie A Fashion Fairytale
1,DVD was not included in case.,"I got this video for my neice for Christmas however when she opened it and wanted to watch it right away, there was no dvd in the case. The case was empty leaving her and I extremely disappointed. Unfortunately, I do not know who to contact about this issue to recieve a replacement as I threw away the packaging material with the invoice. Any help would be appreciated."
3,Not Rated,"This is a good movie that my daughter enjoys and would love to share with her friends at preschool; unfortunately, this move is ""Not Rated"". Seems like a simple thing to do--too bad for Barbie, Artisan, and FHE :-("
3,Looks Better Than It Works,"i am quite dissapointed in this product. i have a motorola phone and most of the low-priced cell accessories out there are for nokias so i was quite happy to see that this would fit my cell phone. it was nothing like i expected. first of all, putting it in your ear is something that you have to practice at. i have had it for 2 days so far and i have yet to figure out how to put it in without it falling out (yes, im using the correct size and side). it never wants to stay in my ear. also the sound stinks. i have to turn the volume on my phone up and the sound still comes in a bit fuzzy and soft. i also dont like the little goofy-looking microphone extention. so...overall, had i known how this product really was, i NEVER would have gotten it. i guess sometimes its better to pay more money to get a better quality product."
1,DOESN'T WORK WITH NOKIA PHONES,"I don' t know how well it works, cause it doesn't work with Nokia phones. It doesn't say that anywhere on this page, but if you buy it, it says so on the box."
5,Good headset,I think this is a very good headset and it is very comfortable to use. I have had this headset for 3 years and I have no complaints about it.I saw in someone else's review that they criticized this headset b/c it is not compatible with Nokia phones. If this person had half a clue they would know that 2.5 mm jack headsets (the industry standard) is NOT supported by Nokia. This is not the manufacturer's fault that Nokia decided to be different from everyone else.
2,I don't like it.,"First of all, none of the included earpieces gave me a comfortable and stable fit. Secondly, the short boom mic is not good enough for use in my car, as the other party always has problems hearing me well. It has been relegated to someone's desk here at the office, and I haven't seen it get much use there either."
3,Too much violence this time,"This is the final volume of the Lonesome Dove trilogy, which actually spans the time between DEAD MAN'S WALK and LONESOME DOVE.Three blood-thirsty men - Buffalo Hump, his son Blue Duck, and the Black Vaquero - dominate the story: all three prey on and slaughter and torture whites who have moved into Texas just before the Civil War. McRae and Call and the Texas Rangers do what they can to stop them, but without much luck. The book is a bit too long and way too bloody and violent - one becomes numbed by it all. Missing are the fascinating characters and their sometimes loopy ways that McMurtry is so good at creating."
5,I wish the story would never end.....,"I can't get enough of August and Woodrow...and I love McMurtry's books, each and every one...Of course, Lonesome Dove ranks right up there with GWTW....."
4,"Very Good, I couldn't put it down.","The story picks up about 15 years after Dead Man's Walk and ends about 10 years before Lonesome Dove. Great story, great characters, but it just didn't have the great ending McMurtry usually delivers."
3,"Good, but......","I found this book to be interesting, but bland. I am very familiar with Texas and the rest of the Southwestern US, and I found the detail in the author's description very good, but i did not like the fact that he doesn't dwell into the characters deepluy enough. All conversations and plots seem to be pointless an meaningless. Everyone is just to Blase about everyting and everyone. This is the last book in the lonesome dove series, and frankly, I think this is the last one of the author's books I wll ever purchase again.AW"
1,The Holy Fire: the Story of the Fathers of the Eastern Church,"Out of the three chapters I read before giving up, only one was good. The author was way too wordy, and sometimes used inappropriate words, such as ""Pope of Antioch"". I definitely would not recommend it."
2,Its addicting,Bought it for girlfriend for Christmas... now I'm hooked. I thought it was gonna be some cheesy show.. I was wrong!!
5,I adore this show!,"I looooove Once Upon A Time, I watch the first season on TV and now I own it on DVD! XD I just love having my own copies of this *amazing* show!"
5,One of the best shows ever!,"Keep this one handy for rainy days. One of the best shows on TV, pulls the viewer in like Lost did a few years ago. Great writing, so enjoyable."
5,once upon a time,"what an excellent show. so entertaining, it keeps you wanting to see the next episode. such a different concept in television shows."
4,I'm hooked,"I'm usually not a big tv viewer, but I was downloading entertainment apps on my smartphone to see which ones I could see shows or movies without paying $$$, and abc's app had the season premier, a few of the initial shows, and the last few shows of the season. Just enough to get me hooked. It's fairy tales with a realistic twist told in the modern world, following a central few characters. I can't wait to see what happens next."
2,The conflict is artificial,"even though it is set in a fairytale genere, I feel like the relationships between the characters is fake and forced. Rumplstiltskin is genuine and believable evil. The others are tiresome. I wish they weren't. I wish I liked this show. It has everything going for it... and yet, it misses the authentic struggle to make it truly great. Merlin is an example of how silly premises can still hold real emotional value. Those characters are connecting in an authentic way. Maybe Once Upon A Time will get better in time. Merlin did."
5,Once Upon A Time Season 1 Box Set Review,"Amazing! I adore this series! (Which is saying something since I don't normally watch that much TV.) If you're a fan of some of the classic fairy tales, prepare to be surprised when the creators of Lost put an amazing spin on every faiy tale character you know (or don't know). A must buy. ^-^"
3,This is no Grimm!,"Grimm is just so much better. The Rumplestilskin character is good on here. and everybody is very well-acted. the evil queen is geat, Ginnifer Goodwin is gret, her daughter is great. the costumes and acting and quality are all great. It is just kind of boring. It makes me fall asleep and I really dont care about the plot and the characters, though i want to. I love Grimm, this show is very so so, and I put the dvd in when I have no other dvds, because I dont have cable or satellite, so I have no tv reception."
5,love the show,"Was very happy to get, missed the first few shows. Now everyone wants to barrow and watch over and over. Love it!"
5,Once Upon A Time,This was the perfect way to catch up on a series that is getting such rave reviews. The purchase was easy and downloaded instantly. Video was smooth and not jerky like some downloaded shows. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes sci-fi or fantasy shows.
5,Wonderful Show!,It's been so long since there has actually been a show that my Husband & I sit together to watch. When the end of the show comes to a close for the night we look at each other and say: OMG! I can't wait until next week to see what happens. Great show! I had to purchase the first season so we have it to watch over & over again. I can't wait until All of season 2 is available for purchasing.... Love it Love it Love it!!!!
4,Awesome!,"Looove this episode!! Only drawback was it was slow streaming, but that may have been my connection... overall best episode of the season!"
4,Buying it,I would rather buy it here then have to sit though the commercials. I think its worth the $1.99 or even $2.99 for HD.
2,Common sense. . .,"Here's the plan: 1. know what your children's homework is (communicate with their teachers) 2. stay on top of whether they're doing it 3. use a system of ""consequences"" (reward/punishment) to reinforce their study behaviors. OK---I just saved you $12.95! This book is only simple common sense; there is NOTHING innovative or helpful inside."
3,Problems,"I found that if you entered a wrong figure and went through the process of measuring body fat, that if you went back and corrected the wrong figure and remeasured you got the same answer as the first time unless you changed to a different memory. This is not how it should function, as I read the directions."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I bought this Analyzer for its size and that is all it has going for it. When first purchased it allowed me to enter my height in Feet and inches and my weight in pounds. However after a few days it randomly switched to Kg and cm. No matter what I try it will not switch back. That would be forgivable were it not for the gross inaccuracy of its overall performance. When I first used it I was told I had 26% body fat, later that same day I met with a trainer at my gym who, using calipers, measured my body fat at 15%. In short this thing sucks."
2,Doesn't fit 2 5/16 ball,Not even close to fitting a 2-5/16 ball. The design to hold the cover onto a ball seems flawed. The rubber is very thin...not sure it would last very long.
4,"Nice, light, girly scent",My sister bought this perfume a few years ago and I really liked it. It has a light girly scent that's not overpowering but I can still smell it throughout the day. I also really like Paris Hilton's perfume Siren. These two are my favorite
4,Just Me Paris Hilton,"The Just Me is a fresh and pleasant aroma, is also very affordable relative to other fragrances. Liked it better than the other two most expensive perfume to buy"
1,Not long last,"This spray i bought for my mother, and she is very upset that the bottle, the quality of the spary proves itself that it's noth but waste of money. This is fake ...i would rather suggest to pay more nd buy from macys....u won't regret"
5,Wonderful little book,This book is really cute - love all of the little pictures and descriptions. A fun short read. I bought it as a birthday gift for a huge dog lover and she absolutely adored it!
3,What happened to Audioslave?,"The movie features some great pieces by Audioslave, very prominently. Why were they left off the soundtrack, I'd like to know. The soundtrack is good, but I can't comprehend why the Audioslave songs were left off. Their fit was perfect."
1,Miami Vice Soundtrack,"This is the first time I have ordered a conpact disk from Amazon.com.I must say, I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the music on this CD. I originally had this sound track on tape and enjoyed it very much. However when I placed this CD in the player, I thought I had the wrong CD. The music was over-run with background noise. The quality and frequency range was the lowest I have ever heard on a compact disc. I am still looking for this, but will try to purchase it from a retail outlet where I can review it before purchasing. I will probably not be buying any music CD'S over the internet again."
1,Is it worth it?,"I got this CD for one song. Why it' even on the CD is unknown to me. The whole CD sucks except for this one song. I guess I got what I wanted, Thanks..........."
3,Incomplete Soundtrack,"Besides enjoying the movie, I especially liked the track with the first love scene of Sonny (Colin Farrell) and Isabella (Gong Li). I would replay my DVD just to hear that fabulous song (""Shape of Things to Come"" by Audioslave on ""Revelations"" CD). That song intensified the episode and enhanced the film. Omitting that track is similar to watching the DVD of the Ben-Hur procession of chariot riders and, after listening to the CD, feeling ripped off at not having that music included. I also did not care for the random listing of the tracks which did not follow the screenplay action. Michael Mann has a reputation for wanting close to perfection in his projects. He produced this CD; he could have done a better job."
2,Major Microphone problems,"I agree with a previous review, that the microphone on thesedevices are useless. I've had my EarBud for 10 days and the microphone has already stopped working."
1,Useless,"Earbud doesn't stay in ear, regardless of size ear gel used. Sound had background noise. I'm returning it."
5,"Gregg L. Friedman MD Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL","This is an excellent textbook which explores the topic of forensic psychiatry. You will learn both the medical and legal aspects of various cases. The book is well written and easy to read. It is a great book for any psychiatrist to have. By Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL"
3,just clearing the air,"i'll give it a 3 just to be fair. it's my cd, as it stands. i'm only writing because i'm a home musician who thinks it's not entirely cool to come onto these shops to bash albums that they haven't heard just to tear someone down. grow up. as for everyone else, you can draw your own conclusion or you can walk away. i don't particularly mind either way. take care"
1,Made both of my dogs sick,"I gave these to my two shih tzu's and they have been throwing up for the past two days. It was the only new item in their diets, so I know it is because of the treats. It seems I am not the only one with this problems according to the other reviews."
1,Dingo Munchy Stix made my dog very sick,"Please don't buy these for your dog. These have artificial colors and pork in them that is not listed on the product description online. These made my dog very ill. He had diarrhea and was throwing up for a week. I was very worried about him. This was the only change in his diet, I feed him all natural food with no artificial anything. I thought these were made of chicken & natural accourding to the online description but they are not."
5,50% more free!,"I just wanted to add that my order on March 11, 2007 came with 15 dingo stix per package, thats 50% more free, and they are still priced @ 1.25 with buy 3 get one free, a great deal and the dogs love everything dingo so far."
5,The finest hip hop lp of the 90's,Kool Keith flips madd skillz on this lp. Representing porn has to demand respect from all heads. All that other stuff that bites his style is madd toy. Go to the source kid and get this lp.
2,no variety what so ever...the beats get old real fast,"This album is sort of a let down. I dont think keith put much into this. Its beats get old after a while and soon u end up just turning it off. Now im a kool keith listener and i have all of his works but this is a real disapointment. I give the two stars to keiths lyrics which keep the record from fallin into the complete disaster catagory. Although, many of keiths fans do like this LP, i suggest u dont listen to the hype because believe me this is no gem. But if u are a keith fan u'll probablly end up buying it anyways."
2,The original version was better,"I saw this when it was on cable years ago before they edited and chopped it up. It was definitely not a kid's movie. However, it was much funnier. The editing on the VHS version is extremely poor. You can see the movie was spliced and just taped back together. I hope that the movie is released on DVD with the original version as an option. The original version gets 5 stars!!!!"
3,Easier To See Than Explain!,"I kind of liked this animated film, at least the first time. On the second viewing, this George Lucas-produced movie was a little slow for me. It's still a unique film.It is different from the rest simply because it gives you a combination of animation and black- and-white stills. It goes back and forth and sometimes on the same scene.The visuals aren't the only strange aspects. You also get a dash of zaniness in this comedy. You just don't know what crazy thing you are going to see next. There are so many unexplainable scenes that it's one of these films is better seen than explained!I really wish this would come out on DVD, as I don't have the VHS anymore and would like to see the film again."
2,Can You Say Typographical Errors?,"Wow! Just read through this manual! I can't believe how many typographical errors I found in this book. The author definitely needs to spend the money on having this book professionally edited before he goes through his second printing.The manual itself does have some useful information however most of it is a re-hash of information from other such books. Some even looks like it was copied directly from a FOIA government manual.I have been in the protection business for over 30 years and can say with all sincerety, that you should spend your money elsewhere."
5,Always a classic!,"I missed the original airing of Star Trek because I was only 3 or 4 at the time. I discovered the series in the late 70's and have enjoyed it ever since. I boxes of VHS tapes and converted them to Divx for my home server. Being able to stream them on the Kindle Fire or my TV in HD is great! They updated the shots of the Enterprise with CG images, but it doesn't distract from the original feel of the show."
3,"Pretty good, but issues","While I'm pleased to be able to complete the BluRay collection with season 3, I've been having troubles with the discs themselves. On several of the shows, the ""original"" effects appear to be missing - when I start the ""Original Effects"" version, it still has the enhanced effects.This may be my player, but if I press ""STOP"" and then try to resume with ""PLAY"", the disc starts over; it's very annoying, and doesn't do that on other discs.Not a huge problem, because the new effects are great, but I'm wondering if others have this problem as well."
4,not bad,This isnt a bad a season of star trek there some good ones some some real bad onesbut to see the new remaster of this series it is good to watch even its much better then the original version but imo...
2,DVD's features,"This is not a review about the Star Tract series they speak for themselves, But I read so little about the DVD's features that I thought something should be said.Pros- the new CG add a great deal to the visual and that is the only good thing I can say.Cons- there are no chapters / no scene selection options.At the end of each movie, you will see the main menu in which to select an episode, but not only visual display but a sound tract of the transporter that is twice the sound level as the prior movie, it is particularly annoying and repetitive! The programming holds open the main menu thereby preventing most DVD players from launching ""screen savor mode"" this resulted in an optic laser burn out on my changer player."
3,regular dvd does not have as much as reviews claim,"The remastered special effects are very good. The Blu ray version has far more features than the regular dvd version. But Amazon gives reviews for the blu ray version of this in the same product information screen as for the regular dvd version. This misleads people into believing that they will get all the same features no matter which version they purchase. This is not true. In order to avoid misleading people, amazon should not give people the reviews for the blu ray version when they ask for the reviews of the standard dvd version."
5,These ARE the voyages,"It's all about the original series - this is Star Trek, everything else - even good stuff like Next Gen or DS9 is basically good fan fiction!There are episodes among the classic 79 that don't work but this show is more than the sum of it's parts and I can't think of one show from the sixties, with the exception of the Twilight Zone, that is just as brilliant, insightful, and entertaining as Star Trek.The Blu-Rays are terrific and the price is amazing - it's taken many years for Paramount to do right by Star Trek fans, and these season sets have been well produced and very affordable - this is a must own for any Star Trek fan or anyone who enjoys classic TV."
2,Audio poor-Menus not user friendly,"As some reviews have indicated the audio sound quality is poor with intermittent sound drops in scenes. The menus are hard to navigate. There's no ""play all' choice. So there's alot of fumbling with menus and selections after each episode that is once you figure out how the menus function. The scenes, the costumes and the people are all beautiful in HD. The incredible amount of detail that is lost and unseen in this and many other episodes and movies in general for over decades and decades until HD in very sad. We're just now able to visualize what the real scenes and sets and costumes actually looked like. However, this does not override the overall poor performance of these discs."
3,The BEST of Star Trek VOL. 3?,"When reading the security label across the top of the Slim Line box. I noticed itread ""The (Best) of the original series (Vol).3"" The Best of, Vol. 3. I haventpurchased the set yet so I'm not sure. Is the the COMPLETE season 3. Don't Like theslim line box that doesnt match the first two sets at all. I'll remember Paramounthow you cheapened things up at the end of this series when you market ""THe Next Generation""in Blu Ray and wait to buy the compete set or at least matching ones when you offer the last season."
4,Great item!,"Pros:Lights up the page perfectly and evenlyDoesn't get hotBulbs don't seem to ever burn outKeeps light confined to page, thus being less disturbing anyone near by who may be trying to sleepCons:Plastic scratches rather easily, however the scratches aren't really noticeable when reading, only when holding the item up to a light.Verdict: Buy it if you want a light, convenient and reliable booklight."
2,"Great for the first week, then fragile and ineffective","A lot of the reviewers must have written in the first week that they got their LightWedge. It's a wonderful honeymoon -- the light is even, and the product is well-designed. After that honeymoon, though, the relationship falls apart. The LightWedge is EXTREMEMLY prone to scratches, and despite coddling it and keeping it in its case at all times, mine became so scratched as to be ususable after just a few weeks. It's a great idea, but until this product can withstand gentle, everyday use you should avoid it."
2,Squint City,I was really displeased with this product. It's horribly dim lighting and distorted lines across the page. The batteries are difficult to jam in also. I'm sending this back.
1,Lightwedge Reading Light,Very disappointed with this product. It leaves circular shadows on the book page. Would have returned it but my spouse threw packaging away before I tried it.
1,Way too dim,"I thought this was the solution to the problem of trying to do some late-night reading without disturbing my hubby. However, it turned out to be a major disappointment because it doesn't carry out the basic function of a reading light; ie, provide enough light to read by. The two lamps cast a light that is dim and streaky; the page is legible, but only with severe eye strain...Great idea, but needs more LIGHT!"
5,"book light , not room light","THis book light works well and doesn't light up the whole room. I have the paper back size and I am thinking about geting the larger size too, although the small size still works on larger books, you just have to move it down the page a little."
1,it was good while the batteries lasted,"I tried to change the batteries. Three were difficult to remove, and the 4th one - impossible. So it is useless to me"
3,"Great Froth, Fragile Glass","I have on hand several manual frothing devices. I like that steel frothers can be set directly on the stove top to warm the milk before plunging. Sometimes my burners are all in service and I reach for my BonJour glass Caffé Frother. I like that the glass allows me to see how I am doing with the milk but when I try to warm it up in the microwave first, I have had three of the glass beakers crack or break, even when warmed on low power settings. The description and Amazon review for this item, written by Garland Withers, claims that the device can be used in the microwave to warm the milk (without the steel plunger, of course). Perhaps this is an assumption on Wither's part but I can tell you that the beakers provided by BonJour crack when used in the microwave.The frothing screen is well designed and requires a minimal number of pumps to effectively froth the milk. If it weren't for the fragile glass, I would give this item five stars."
3,Major differences between 6th and 7th Edition!,"My 6th Edition arrived promptly and in excellent condition. Our course instructor had compared earlier editions when new one's were available in the past and noticed little difference. So, to save money, I bought the 6th Edition rather than the 7th and quickly found that there were some substantial changes that made it difficult to do a group study. Now, I see that new copies of the latest (7th) edition are available at a lower price than new copies of the 6th. Hopes this helps someone avoid this problem."
1,"Doesn't enhance laptop, no customer service","I had 512 in my laptop, and upgraded to 1 GB using this Kingston memory. I have not noticed any difference, and my laptop otherwise is as clean as possible, I do all the preventive and follow-up cleaning I should do.Anyway, my biggest beef is that I wrote to them over two weeks ago about this before posting my feedback - and I haven't heard a thing."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered the Minolta 80 Zoom camera and it was shipped to me and was OK. I then ordered one for a friend, however, it did not work. I returned it to the vendor who sent me another camera. This second one did not work. I returned it, indicating I did not want another one, that I wanted a refund. I did not get the refund from the vendor, so I called Amazon, who processed the credit for the return. The first camera I purchased did not take good pictures. I was very disappointed with the quality of the camera."
1,Heaven Can Wait,"It will not play on my TV, only my computer. A message comes up saying it won't play in this area or something to that effect. Not happy about that."
5,Bike Race Motivation poster,I bought this poster for my husband who is an avid bike rider. He loved it. It came quickly. All is good. Thanks
1,Don't buy this book - it's being advertised via spam!,"Received the following *UNSOLICITED* email from someone related to this book. I certainly didn't ask for information on this book, and I certainly don't appreciate folks wasting my time with their ads!Don't buy from spammers.

2,Fragile glass container,"This would be a great device if the glass were more rugged. You have to hold it up near the top to get the top to stay in place while you push the foam making plunger up and down. This led to the glass breaking on my second try.I was pleased that the company, 10th avenue kitchen I think, returned my money with no problems.I purchased another unit - that I like a lot. It is simple and generates lots of foamy milk for cappuccino or latte with no problem. It is the ""Aerolatte"". I can make myself a cappuccino as good or better than any coffee house. I love it."
3,Quest Study Bible Personal size,"I liked the bible but, the letters were too small and it seemed as if the page layout was too condensed. Other than that, I would recommend it"
1,"Was it a choice, this book would have gotten zero stars","This book was a disappointment at best. The entire story line was a Poe story mixed with your generic teenage drama. I was expecting an intriguing story, after hearing only good things about the author, but I was let down. The majority of the book was introducing the characters and setting, and when the action finally developed at the end of the book, the plot was insultingly simple. The long beginning leads you to think there will be a complex story line, but instead it develops the same as many other teenage drama books. Also, the book gives the appearance of being a book for older, high school aged teens, the language seems to be geared more towards younger, elementary school aged children. I am more than surprised that anyone could think Nixon is a great author, or that this book is a ""must read."""
1,Not my type of book,"I really did not like this book. I thought the main character was boring (and kind of annoying). The plot seemed unrealistic. I'm all for scary books about haunted houses, but some of the story just didn't make sense. It was very surreal. On the day they decide to look at the house, suddenly everyone shows up to buy the place... It's just weird. There are lots of plot mix-ups like this. Also, the heroine is fifteen, but the book seems to be written for fourth grade. It was so unchallenging that it got boring. I didn't find the scary parts scary at all (that may be because I've read much scarier stuff though). And the real story didn't start until over I'd finished over 100 pages, more than half the book. Those pages seemed to only be setting up the plot. That's a lot of the book to use as an introduction. I guess it's just not my type of book."
5,suspensful so scary if you read it at night you wont sleep,"the book is about a girls desprate attempt to stop her parents from moving into a haunted house and adopting a dozen ""unadoptable kids"" once you pick it up you wont be able to put it down. thrilling chilling and a good scare!!"
2,''MISLEAD'',"OK SO YOU WOULD THINK IT DOES EVERYTHING SPECIFIED IN THE COMPANY DESCRIPTON.NO!DOES NOT RECORD AND PLAYBACK AT 96 AT THE SAME TIME!I WANT MY FREAKING COINS BACK,LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZERS!NO GET IF TRYING TO RECORD AT 96.THANK ME LATER LANDSTOPFLOW."
2,Works as long as you do NOT USE HIBERNATE,"Great performance, never had an audio related problem, unless I put the computer into hibernate/sleep mode. In M-Audio's own fine print, which I had to search for, they say the device is NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK if you put your computer into hibernation/sleep. Your computer will not recognize it when you turn it back on.Then you have to fully restart your computer in order to hear sound... VERY ANNOYING.I've witnessed this behaviour on Mac's and PC's."
3,"Great Concept, not exactly working as expected","I did need to use their tech support to get this puppy rolling, and I have yet to figure out midi with it, but all in all, it's pretty simple and I have heard that it can record nicely. I've been averagely successful with it so far, so I give it 3 stars."
3,buyer beware,This piece of equipment does not work with mac's new lion. It only works with some older versions of both mac an pc systems. Do your research. I had to return the one I ordered. Thank goodness amazon was speed lighting at returning a refund.
3,Fast Track on slow track with Vista,"M-Audio Fast Track Pro is a nice piece of equipment, but it is not compatible with Windows Vista. M-Audio won't say if or when they will have new drivers available."
4,it's really funny if you watch more than once,"this movie makes no sense and bryan gordon must have been on acid when he made it. however, it is downright hilarious. watch it more than once and you will love it. the best scene is when jim's dad comes to wake him up and says ""jim get up. yo jim get up."" jennifer connelly is also gorgeous too and she makes the movie even better. check it out."
2,Ferris Bueller Works The Graveyard Shift At Target,"John Hughes must have had real confidence in his script that he had to dole it off to someone else to direct. This flick is lame to the extreme. The material is razor thin and even at 83 minutes it feels like an eternity. Frank Whaley, a genial young actor from the late Eighties and early Nineties whom I usually like,comes off as somewhat obnoxious. High points are a luscious young Jennifer Connelly who would be hot reading the phone book, William Forsythe as the redneck maintenance supervisor, and John Candy as the Target personnel director who almost hires Whaley as an executive instead of as a minimum wage clean-up boy. Candy wasn't always the most discriminating in choosing his parts but he was smart enough to take his name off the credits of this turkey. To quote Herman's Hermits a must to avoid."
4,Touch,"Touch's only album (1969) is both legendary AND a well-kept secret. One of the first progressive rock albums, ""Touch"" (the brainchild of 19 year old Don Gallucci) mixes rock, jazz, psychedelia, and classical music, with a restriant all too rare among similar bands.Tracks: We Feel Fine, Friendly Birds, Miss Teach, The Spiritual Death Of Howard Greer, Down At Circe's Place, Alesha And Others, Seventy-Five.(Renaissance #RCD1001. This release also includes three bonus tracks.)"
2,So-so sci-fi,Somewhat interesting story that could have used some major editing. Overall not bad but probably not worth the time.
1,Boring.,"I enjoyed the style and premise of the book but eventually just put it down and stopped reading it for one simple reason:The good guys always win, the bad guys always lose. This theme becomes so prevelent and predictable that the battles are literally the most boring parts of the book. All the bad guys get mowed down, one good guy gets shot in the arm, hooray for humanity, repeat for every fight. It's like every Stallone/Van Damme/Chuck Norris movie all rolled into one rather cheesy book. He did a lot of this in his Mission Earth books as well, but there it was intentional and funny, in Battlefield Earth it's serious to the point of just creating a ridiculous story.Maybe 1 star isn't being completely fair overall, but this one aspect was enough to make me stop reading, so I figure it's justified."
4,"Good, but could have been better","Battlefield Earth is not what you will expect.What I expected was 1000 pages of humans verses only Psychlos, with a final confrontation between the hero and the villain. What happened was that the Psychlos got defeated in the first half. Then humanity had to set up a new form of government, and then there is yet another threat. The problem is, that the Psychlo/human battles at the first half of the novel are more interesting than the rest of the book.However, of all the books that I have read, this is the one book that I would consider complete, with no possiblility of a sequel. Everything gets wrapped up. Read it at your library first before buying it. The author's writing is not the best. Also, I wish Terl was used more in the novel."
1,This one star is a dying one.,"I don't understand how any professional, honest reviewer gave this lump of nothing positive words. Please, please readers - you must understand that any five star review of this book contains more creativity than the story itself. If those are honest reviews, I'm curious about what other books they have read. One star for this scheisse is too generous. I think I read about 200 pages. The writing and characters were so empty; the white spaces between the words overwhelmed the words themselves. It was so bad it made me angry. I ripped it apart. Battlefield Earth, no, more like Bumblebee Enema."
1,Not worth the time.,"The only reason I gave this book one star is because there is no lower rating available. I would have to suspect that Scientologists have been enlisted to give this book favorable ratings in order to put the book in a good light. Hubbard's halting disjointed writing style may be tolerable for a 4th grader but not for anyone of any intelligence. Not only that but he just keeps going on and on and on with this horrible plot and shoddy character development. If you want to read something by a Sci-Fi writer of some note check out ""Ender's Game"" by Orson Scott Card. This awful narrative would have been better suited to a 6 or 7 page short story in a magazine with very low circulation."
1,THE WORST BOOK EVER?,"It could be. Honestly,one of the most mind-bogling slow and poorly paced plots,of all time. Some folks find it to contain adventure I found NONE it was real bad."
3,So-so sci-fi,"Battlefield Earth is fairly good most of the way through, starting with Jonnie Tyler's travails as a backward stone-age human captured by aliens who have conquered earth long ago. Jonnie's struggle to escape slavery and lead a revolt against the aliens is the best part of the book, covering the first half to 2/3rd's of the book, where the book reaches an action packed climax. However, the last part of the book gets very tedious and complicated, with lots of financial intrigue that gets rather boring. I hope the movie version sticks to the action and leaves out the last part of the book."
1,Why?!!,I wanted this to be good. The end is absurd and boring. It is so shallow. I read through the whole thing hoping something would redeem it. What a waste!!! Read Dune instead.
1,What a poor read and wasted purchase,"I am a fan of sci-fi and fantasy; they are the genres I enjoy most when reading for entertainment. This novel, however, is the first novel that I stopped reading. L. Ron ""Lord Xenu"" Hubbard couldn't come up with better character names than Jonnie Goodboy, Pattie, Chrissie, Limper (who had a bad leg, of course), and an alien named Zzt (I prefer Yyz thank you very much Neil Peart). This book was 1,000+ pages of one-dimensional simplistic drivel. Spare yourself and read Heinlein if you want to read a classic sci fi novel. I'd suggest The Red Planet and Starship Troopers (nothing like the movie)."
5,Fantastic,"Well written, and so much better then the movie. A remake is in order then maybe the movie could be as good as the book."
3,well,well what the book was ok. I am not a big fan of science fiction but the book was ok. the book took awile to pick up but when it did it was good.
3,Enjoyable read,"It's over 1,500 pages so it takes plenty of time to read it. I liked the story but have to agree with some other reviewers who thought that less pages would have done the same trick. The twists in the run-up to the plot are quite good, esp. the in the last couple of hundred pages when an planetary bank gets involved, and the main characters have to face an absurd, surreal situation about the finer points of intergalactic financing and their beloved home planet, but I think I should leave it that before I give away too much."
2,"Fair, but not good.","Complete brain candy. That's not necessarily a bad thing. This book is great if you've got lots of time to kill and don't want something that makes you think too hard. Probably the hardest thing about this book is keeping your place in it. Like all of Hubbard's books that I've read it could have been a third as long and still told the same story. Complete space opera, but if that's what you're into then it's worth getting. If you want something more substantial or meaningful try 'Doc' Smith. ; )"
4,One of the Top 5 Best SCI-FI Novels of all time,"Its been 10+ years since I consumed this novel. I found it to be very entertaining. True, It does get second-gradish at times, but the overall experience is well worth the time."
1,"It wouldn't fit, then it broke","I lost my generic earbud headset and bought the Jabra EarWrap as a replacement, with high hopes. The unit appears to blend form and function, offering the convenience of a compact hands-free headset with a boom mike for increased outbound audio quality.The reality of the headset was very disappointing. I was unable to secure the headset to my ear in a way that prevented it from flopping around my face with the slightest head movement. I eventually achieved almost satisfactory results by giving the flexible ear attachment hook a good squeeze (it's pliable) each time I put on the headset. This worked until the attachment hook snapped near its base. I returned the headset to my local retailer who reported that the broken ear hook was a recurring problem with this headset design."
1,worst pharmacy text ever written,"I have never read such lousy writing and ideas in a textbook before. Their extensive use of acronyms (TLC, AFB, ARB, NIUTCHM) is ungodly. The case histories are totally unbelievable. These writers couldn't be further removed from the real world of patient care.Complete waste of money!"
3,An ok deal,I bought this camera with the idea in mind of just taking average pics of friends and what not and it did it's job. It's fairly simple to use both with taking pics and uploading on to your computer. But if you're looking for spectacular quality you might want to spend a little more dough.
1,Defective product,"I bought this camera from J&R Music. It took 3 bussiness days for J&R to ship the camera. After all the camera is defective, not sealed in original manufacture package( so either it is a return or refurbished product)."
4,Takes Fine Pix...,"I have the 2600 model, which looks and functions somewhat the same... It certainly isn't the coolest looking thing around and is kinda bulky (like me). But still, the price and image quality is fantastic. And like it's name, it really does take some Fine Pix."
4,Red-Eye,This camera is so easy to use and takes great pics. The only problem is the red-eye. We've always had this problem with our blue-eyed son. I can't count the number of snapshots that leave him looking like some sort of cute demon!His red-eye problem is worse than ever with this camera. We took some shots at his brothers party the other day and he looks positively frightening! It (the red-eye monster) even affected my brown-eyed husband and daughter(we've never encountered problems there before). Any suggestions are appreciated!
1,Screen went blue,This camera was great the first 3 times that I used it. The next time I went to use it the screen was blue with lines and it only takes photos about every 10 times you press the button. A real crime since the camera was easy to set up and the menu's were very intuitive....
5,best camera i have ever owned,I have had different digital cameras in my time but this camera far exceeds any camera i had before. I have even paid 1000 dollars for a professional digital camera before and it still wasn't as good as this camera. And for the price that amazon.com is selling it for is rarely even heard of. So the bottom line is take my advice and buy this camera you won't be sorry.
2,Inevitable Surprises,"Good current trend analysis. Personal political bias reflected. Technical errors: Thinks methane is a fuel - it is not, Thinks is clean - actually causes more pollution to make than gasoline causes when burned. No conclusions on trends, only vague thoughts and recommends positive thinking."
1,Not Functioning on XP well,"The games are probably as great as when I used to play them... But I can't figure out how to make the graphics well on my computer. Maybe it is not XP compatable, but there was no mention of this on the purchase listing."
1,The Worst Experience Ever,"I booted up my Mac off the CD containing the software, as was recommended. After the software scanned my disk and, uh, 'repaired' it, I was unable to get back into my operating system and the screen came up the dreaded big Question Mark. After having the guy at the Apple Store fiddle with my computer, I used Disk Warrior (which I now know is a much better product) and had the fellow at Apple reinstall OS X; the whole thing took 3 hours, I was able to retreive some information, but most of my system needed to be reconfigured and much was lost. I called Symantec for help ($29.95 per call) and they couldn't help me. I had to pay someone hundreds of dollars to fix my computer. Avoid this product!!"
3,reasonably interesting ramblings on colour in film,"Bellantoni's book is interesting, a nice light read on colour in film. It is nothing in comparsion to Bruce Block's 'The Visual Story' which explains colour, whereas this book is just a series of examples. It's both the author's interpretation and she's interviewed a number of DOP's etc of note. I'm not trying to say this book is of no value (it has good interviews, great colour stills and covers a lot of films), but I feel a more accurate review is required on this book given the other reviews are clearly written by Bellantoni's New York and LA friends. The back of the book says please review this book online, which indicates the publishers know the value of these reviews, and therefore seek to send out a few themselves."
3,Not agin.,I wish the pieces were bigger to actually play with. A little disappointed. The stands don't work we'll either. I wouldn't recommend this as a gift.
4,Good for the price,"This gazebo is for temporary use, but looks great. I left it set up outside for a week and it finally fell over (was not staked into the ground) but no poles bent or anything. Caused a small tear in the top of the canopy, but still completely functional. Creates nice big shaded space. Not to bad to set up either, even though it does take at least two people."
1,"Rain Catcher, not Gazebo","Loved the size of the gazebo for the price....I saw that it had a warranty. So I purchased it. The first rain we had, which lasted about ten minutes, caused the roof to collapse in. There is a design flaw that lets rain get caught on the roof and in 10 minutes you have about 20 gallons of water on the roof that can now double as a giant bird bath.I am in the process of trying to get a refund, but other customers have posted that they are being denied the warranty.I wish I could paste the picture of the giant bird bath that I took."
3,Difficult to set up,"This is definitely a 2-person job.The instructions don't talk about one component -- a fabric strip about 6 inches wide that is angled, but basically a large circle. It has hooks at the angles, which correspond to the vertical supports. It seems intended to go round the outside, but is too short to do so. And too long to go round on the inside."
2,Saturnalia,"Saturnalia is a boring, but exciting in its own little way. Its characters are very fascinating. The characters I liked were William, Malcolm, the Curries, and Madam Phipp. William is a Narraganset Native American. He was very smart and had a good memory. Malcolm was funny. He was a lady's man, always trying to please women. The Curries are William's English family. They treat William with great respect. Last, but not least is Madam Phipp. She is not easily tricked. The style is excellent. It could change people thoughts really smoothly even though it is kind of confusing. The setting was okay. It let you know what time it was, the weather, and the place. The theme isn't really that clear. I rate this book a 2. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading historical fiction."
2,Saturnalia,"After reading this book, I found that I did not particulary like it. That may be because I am not a very big historical fiction fan, or maybe because I did not click with it. In othere words, I thought that this book was not of interest and would advise people not to read it unless they enjoy historical fiction very, very much.The story is about an Indian, not a Native American, named William. He is an apprentice in a printing shop. Saturnalia is an old holiday celebrated by his masters. During this time, the serving people trade places with their masters.Also, the revenge the tithingman is trying to place apon William. Another character is a man who is lovesick and wants to win the heart of of a widowed woman. He tells his apprentice Malcolm to deliver gifts to her, but Malcolm gives the better ones to a heartless serving maid."
3,um......snoozefest...until the end,"Well, I had to read Saturnalia in my Language Arts class, and frankly, it was an ok book. I don't despise it, but it wasn't cathing and exciting. After reading the book, I found out barely anything on what Saturnalia is, infact only 2-3 pages were devoted to this topic, even though it's the book's namesake. That was one of the things that threw me off. The book didn't get the least bit exciting until the lastpart of chapter 6, and chapter 7, and even then it was't all that suspenseful. The book was funny though, hysterically. I loved the parts with Malcolm and Mr. Hogwood, they were comical..... Overall this book was ok, but it could have been better."
1,Another Springer Verlag Flop,"Whenever I see Springer Verlage at the bottom of a book's picture in Amazon, I immediately dismiss it - regardless of the the quality of the average customer review. These texts are excessively (and unnecessarily) mathematical; they rarely impart any intuition (if at all). I thought this book might be the exception but it was not."
2,Non-Technical Interviews of People in the Field,I was hoping this book would be a technical discussion about robotic interstellar travel. I was disappointed to discover that it was largely a non-technical series of interviews of people working in the fields of interstellar space flight. I was hoping to get a real understanding of the energy required to attain relativistic velocities but I was disappointed. I also wanted to learn a lot more about ion propulsion but this was only lightly touched on. There was not a single illustration or graph in this book. I also did not follow the logic of the topics covered; it was as if the author just assembled chapters based on the people he was able to get interviews with.
5,Dance Diva Remixes and Rarities,"This is an excellent CD for fans and collectors to buy the songs are cool,the sound quality is excellent."
4,"Complex, moody and lovely","As someone who lives in one of the states portrayed in the book this was a very interesting read.The book is well written and multi-layered. It has a brooding tone which at first was ""off-putting"" but then I see how it fits with the characters portrayed. This is a book equally about people and place, you can not separate the two. Its a book about snippets of life, not a full novel about everyone. I found myself wanting to know more about the people he Mosher talked to.I would have liked a map and more details on the route."
3,Lakota,"This is a Native American book about the Lakota culture. I found it interesting and it had a good plot. I question the theme of the conflict between the Indians and the White man. It will be interesting to read the books that will follow. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
3,Hmmmmm . . .,"While I bought this knowing it could be ghetto, I didn't realize it could also be good. The routine is literally 3 minutes long but somehow they manage to stretch it out for 30 minutes. The same thing over and over and over and over and over .. .you get the picture. I did feel the burn the next day so perhaps it's mistakenly good for you . . .but the production quality is poor and the white guy who is part of the yoga warm up and cool down . . .nowhere to be found during the hip hop dance routine. Strange."
2,Lost Potential,"The game play for Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb is very poor. As others have said, there is no save option in this game, and the exit and loading screens are very confusing and unnecessary. The camera panning is horrible. You have to move the mouse and the keys to control the character and it takes a lot of getting used to. Although the sound and graphics is excellent, and I had some fun with the fighting, it's too much of a hassle to control the character.I will echo what someone else said about the tram sequence being one of the most pointless in PC gaming history."
2,Adequate but others better.,"The book is done in a really cheap font, which aggravates me. I tried some of its principles with my problem teen. It didn't work for me, and I prefer the sounder, more professional advice of ""Get Out of My Life, but First Could You Drive Me & Cheryl to the Mall: A Parent's Guide to the New Teenager"" at: [...]"
3,Tight fit... Bad Bocal storage,"Tight fit for the bassoon. Had to force it a little at first. Hate where the bocals are stored. love the outer bag, very large pocket and strap."
3,I was expecting something different,This movie was a little harder to get into and I still haven't watched the whole thing. Some of it is just a little too silly.
4,A Useful Supplement,"Nicholas Brown at the University of London has given us a dictionary of the 10,000 words he believes are the most common in Russian. The interesting twist is that the first part of the dictionary is sorted, as the subtitle says, ""in frequency order"". From the most common word meaning, ""and"" to the 10,000th most common meaning, ""furious,raging, fervent"", he outlines a method for expanding your Russian vocabulary. This book could prove to be a useful tool in deciding to memorize particular words.A helpful alphabetical listing follows the frequency list.I think this volume is best used by a second or third year student of colege Russian.This book is also available in paperback."
1,Way Overpriced!,"This is a well researched and scientifically compiled word list...but that is all it is. If you really want to increase your vocabulary you would be better served by a dictionary with example sentences or something like 5000 Russian Words which have all the necessary inflections. At this price, this book is a waste of money."
3,Good for mini camping,Purchased as a Christmas present but ended up keeping it. Have not had the opportunity to use them yet but it appears to be good quality. Handy handles for easy transport to and from. Size of the pots and pan are a bit small for any heavy duty large cooking though. Perfect for one or two people type of cooking at the most. I will use it as additional cookware. Stores neatly together with a mesh bag.
5,Best beginners book around!,"I've had an aquarium for over 4 years. A week after I got my aquarium I was lost so I bought this book. It helped alot. I learned how to choose fish, how to clean the tank, anatomy, breeding, setting up the tank and way more. If this book hadn't been around my aquarium wouldn't be around. I highly recomend this book to any beginners. It's a great book!"
3,it tastes fine,"It's not the best tasting whey protein, but it doesn't taste bad either. It's fine in my book. I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 5 because these bastards don't tell us how much creatine is in it, which pisses me off."
3,"It's a Marlfox review, what's left to say?","Marlfox is definetely one of the better Redwall books. This novel still uses Redwall cleshes, but has several suprising twists. I'll try not to give anything away, but a character from a previous book plays a major part. The book was fairly easy to follow considering the amount of perspectives. Brian Jaques used wonderful detail, but the villains could have been smarter. For example, one of the main villains makes a very stupid mistake ending with lethal consequences. Some other characters desperately needed more background and expansion.(One of the first characters mentioned included!) Overall this book gets: 3&1/2 out of 5 stars."
5,Outstanding Read !!!!!!!!,"Marlfox is a brilliant book written by a great author. I have every Redwall book except fo two of them. This book is a must read and if you haven't already read it, read it! If you have read it, Read it again!!!!!!!!!"
5,Marlfox by Brian Jacques,"Anyone who can read will love this action-packed part of the famed REDWALL series. This great novel contains a story in which the inhabitants of Redwall abbey are forced to fight to protect thier way of life from an army of foxes and rats aiming to both rob them blind AND kill any survivors of the battle. Two generations split up as one group of warriors defends the abbey and thier children set out on a journey of revenge and to prove themselves worthy of respect. Friends stand side by side on the battlefield and at the same time pull pranks at the dinner table in this life-like story containing action, comedy, and a bit of drama."
5,RIVETING!,"The book Marlfox is about a group of mystical foxes who travelto Redwall Abbey in hopes of plundering and taking over. Their planis to take their treasure back to Castle Marl for their evil and greedy mother. Can the simple country folk of Redwall survive this vicious attack? What I really like about this book is the fact that the plot twists around and has you thinking one thing but something totaly different occurs. I also like how the author goes onto such detail describing the great feasts that Redwall often has. This is a wonderful book with deliteful characters, I give it a full five stars. I would recommend this tale to people of any age who love adventure and comedy."
2,It's getting old Mr. Jaques...,"I could stomach Pearls of Lutra. The Long Patrol was so-so at best. By the time I hit Marlfox, I was sick to death of the same plot...you've got the rhyme, the evil and horrible vermin, the cute but annoying Dibbun, the brave hero with Martin's sword(who is NEVER a female), and the Zen master abbot/abbess. I've heard that *Legend of Luke* is much better, but it'll take a lot more to get me to read it than Mossflower or The Bell Maker."
5,Great product,"I bought it for a friend as a gift and he was very happy with the product, was able to try it out in Hawaii.To prevent water entering the mouth, it has two valves, at the mouth level and at the top of the snorkel tube.I could see him going completely underwater for brief but multiple times and I was expecting he'll blow water in the next second, but he could breath normally without interruptions.The mask fits perfectly the face, without allowing water to enter, even if adjusted kind of loose on the head.The product is of high quality, highly recommended."
2,Monotonous,"After looking at the back of the DVD and reading 'Rump', I thought this film would be a knock off of Nutty (professor Clump). I was wrong. This was an amateur production with the ENTIRE film taking place at the dinner table. Yes...the entire film. I was expecting at some point the audience would see the scientist (main character)at work, play or doing a love scene. But no, all we see is dialogue, dialogue, dialogue. The discussions at the table (which are with the main characters family) range from healthcare, science and relationships. There are some funny jokes made from one family member but overall the film remains a the same pace. A bore."
1,Garbage!... Stan Lerner's A bomb on black family...,"Stan... Yes, you have successfully imparted the most horrific stereotypes imaginable against black family... Nothing short of a propagandist A bomb! I don't fully know your motives, but you can't call this transparent mockery art!... This film is simply hateful propaganda worse than that of the early 20th century depictions of black ""life""... I am surprised no-one else has voiced their utter offense to the garbage he portrays as ""family""..."
2,Production quality wipes away the smile,"This hilarious little booklet contains the funniest Non-sequitur comic strips containing the ""What She Said/What He Heard"" theme. Unfortunately, it is so cheaply produced on poor quality paper that I wouldn't recommend it as a gift to anyone but a real fan of the genre. What a shame the production values weren't as high as the comic value."
4,Blue Hawaii,This was given to a friend's dad that was enamored with Hawaii when he got to Hawaii from asia back 50 years ago. He liked watching it again just as much as he did 50 years ago.
4,A fun movie,"This is one of Elvis' best movies, in my opinion. It's fun, lighthearted, and with some pretty good songs in it. Definitely a worthwhile addition to my movie collection."
4,Cute movie,"Might be a typical Elvis movie, but since we had just come back from Hawaii, and saw what the Royal Palms resort looks like today, we really enjoyed this movie."
5,Elvis' Blue Hawaii,Fabulous nostalgia! Too bad the Coco Palms Resort was never re-built after Iniki. I had chills walking around at the Resort - Elvis' ghost was everywhere!
4,Wonderful Postcard,"I re-watched this just before going to Maui last November on my first trip to Hawaii. The story may not be much, but the scenery is ""spot on"" and this is a nostalgia trip for the ""older Hawaii"" of the 50's. What a great postcard, and Elvis thrown in, doing his 60's Elvis thing, with more style and good grace than later films would exhibit. He seemed to enjoy himself and you'll enjoy the music."
4,"Saw this at the neighborhood movie house, hows that for a","blast from the past? I was 10 and I thought how handsome Elvis was, and how blue the sky in Hawaii was. The Technicolor is terrific. Just like a Doris Day film. No real plot but you just can't beat Hawaii for sheer beauty. Pure fun, no calories. Enjoy!"
4,Blue Hawaii is a classic,"If you love Hawaii and were lucky enough or young enough to visit there in the 1960's or even 70's, you will enjoy this campy Elvis movie that was somewhere between his early days and when the movies started to become a bit much if bad. Hawaii used to actually look like this and the movie was really filmed there! If you look up Blue Hawaii on Google you can get the history of the filming there. I give this DVD to first time visitors to Hawaii so that they know what it kind of used to be."
4,Toshiba USB Mini Optical Mouse,"Like the size, it fits my hand well. Would like a longer cord, it does not reach the back of my PC. Is great as a portable mouse. I would rate it 4 stars."
3,Exciting and informative but not very believable,I'll probably become a vegetarian because of this book. I found it very exciting and I learned a lot about the meat industry but I had a very hard time accepting the way the parents behaved after losing their only daughter. If the author had made that more realistic it would have been a more believable read.
3,Enthralling script. Lousy ending.,The scenario and research behind the plot was excellent. I was held in its grasp until the end. That was so disappointing. I guess I was to use my imagination at that point.
1,In the trash,"Cook has written some good books and that's why I bought this one - loyalty. I felt betrayed, ripped off and angry. A great topic, which could have been a great novel, was ruined by an author who could not possibly care about his readers. I kept waiting for something really interesting to happen. As the book drew to its end, I became worried and then suspicous. I couldn't believe what was happening - the story ended with many questions unanswered. It was as if the phone rang while the book was being written and the author just stopped. I will never buy another Robin Cook book. I considered giving this book to someone I didn't like, but I couldn't bring myself to do to anyone what Cook did to me. I threw it in the trash and NOT the recycling bin!"
3,Dr. Cook's traditional medical thriller on a rampage,"This is not the book for one with a weak stomach. Dr. Cook takes us inside the personal struggle of a grieving father trying to uncover the contamination problems in the meat industry after his daughters horrifying bout with the e-coli virus. While those of us that are familiar with Dr. Cook's highly cusading medical thrillers are not as phased by this novels particular vehement (almost hatred) of managed care, those who are not as prepared for it might be stunned out of their ability to ""suspend their disbelief"" and may even find it hard to read through. If you can get past the ranting and raving and the fact that the main character is wholely unlikable in the first part of the book, this is a page turning, emotion renching book that will have you thinking in no time that you might actually like to become a vegitarian!"
3,Nothing too significant for my 1st RC novel,"Although the action was fast paced & continuous, I found the plot in general quite predictable & with a bit of loopholes. It was interesting to note though the effects of mergers/buyouts on the healthcare sector & the resuting power struggle within by remaining staff against 'new management'. How it affected their service & how the patients suffered from such 'politics'. That is very real.What I found quite unrealistic was Kim's decision to work underground in the slaughter house with the intention of obtaining some important papers as evidence of QC failure. This may be an act of desparation but which I found quite out of line for the character.In general, the book was a good weekend read. (This review pertains to Reader's Digest abridged version of the novel.)"
3,Great topic...Disappointing ending.,"Come on Robin...You can do better!!!I've been a long-time fan of Robin Cook and have always been pleased with his writing style. I was VERY disappointed with the way this book was written. The ending of this book was EXTREMELY disappointing...almost like he just wanted to finish the book to get it out of the way. Does this mean there will be a ""Toxin-Part 2""?The only good thing that came out of this book is that I will never be able to enjoy a charbroiled cheeseburger again!"
3,"Frightening, yet incomplete!","There is, without a doubt, that I have become more aware of the things (red meat, especially) that I now eat after having read the book, 'TOXIN.' Even though much of the contents which Dr. Cook wrote was 'indigestiable', the book certainly has made its impact; in getting the people to aware the things that they eat. However, the ONE thing which I dislike about the book; its so-so ending. I believe that there are many other ways which Dr. Cook could have end this book, but it just so happens that the one which he chose was perhaps not the one which many hoped that it would be."
1,"stilted dialogue, an irritating main character,","and unconvincing situations made this book a chore to read. As an avid reader with a love of medical thrillers, i found this book to be unbelievable, not in the story it tried to tell, but in its writing. The main character, a heart surgeon named Kim, was combative and completely unlikeable. He and his ex-wife entered into long dialogues in the midst of a great tragedy involving their young daughter that i found unrealistic. He repeatedly resorted to physical violence with his colleagues and anyone who opposed him, refusing to listen to characters who seemed infinitely more reasonable. Even as a parent, i could muster little sympathy for this raging maniac. I actually found myself exclaiming out loud, ""Oh come on, now!"" at one point. This book now resides in my trash can."
5,"""Toxin"" is exciting, suspensful and thought-provoking.","This book is a blend of edge-of-your-seat excitement and heart-rending tragedy. ""Toxin"" is emotionally gripping and thought-provoking. For me, it has also been life-changing. I have not touched meat since reading this wonderful, fascinating story. I highly recommend this intelligent, exciting, fascinating thriller."
2,Weak stomachs beware,"Robin Cook did a great job of trying to make all of us vegetarians but the story fell short. The main character is so obnoxious! His daughter shows him her hamburger is uncooked and he is so unconcerned he tells her to eat it anyway. She gets sick and he tells her she is going skating anyway. He takes her to the emergency room and DEMANDS special treatment ahead of priority patients. He knows more about what should be done than doctor workings in their specialty. He is so out of control it is ridiculous. Robin Cook doesn't like the way medical care is going in this country or the way our government agencies are in bed with the people they are supposed to monitor. He brings this out loud and clear, but it would have been nice to have had some decent characters to go along with his soap box."
2,E-coli and the Doctor,"This book is about an crazed, but loving, doctor, who is willing to risk everything to put a meat processing company out of business, due to the death of his daughter. He is the target of a hitman, and is fleeing for his life. His ex-wife joins him in his little escapade.This book is good, in that it builds suspense really well. The authors choice of words, and how he describes the environment is undescribable. He makes you feel as if you are the Doctor at the slaughter house.Overall, the book doesn't appeal to me much. It has a very ubrupt ending, and doesn't allow the reader to fully appreciate the end. The author could have done a better job with that. Also, the book assumes a lot. It assumes that the reader knows about the different groups incharge of inspecting meat.I would recommend this book to those looking for a new type of sci-fi."
1,"Disturbing subject, horrid writing","A compelling subject to be sure - I may never go to Burger King again. Too bad the writing is so sophomoric - at times I felt like I was watching a 3rd rate soap opera. As for the ending, Dr. Cook must have had a golf date he couldn't miss - it makes Patricia Cornwell look like Jane Austin."
2,Terrible Ending,"The story and the plot is great, but the ending screwed up the whole thing. Like the other 2 books i have read by Mr.Cook, it makes me wonder if Mr.Cook had run out of time or idea at the end. The book just end at the begining of the climax. I was very disappointed when i reach the end."
4,Toxin by Robin Cook,"Fortunately all of us are not alike. I really enjoy Robin Cook's books because I like medical mysteries. I found the book very enjoyable to listen to while traveling, even though the other people discredited it greatly. Now that I've read the synopsis it makes me want to listen to it again before I sell it."
1,"Start on one topic, shift to another, don't complete either",Cook starts two different stories tied trogether with a tragedy. Enter a meltdown by the lead character. Grow tired of writing and stop before you finish either story. There is a faint reference to some sort of resolution at the end of the story but no clear determination as to what the story ending is. A bad book of a good story.
4,Toxin,"I enjoyed Dr. Robin Cook's book, Toxin, for many reasons. It is the best medical science thriller ive read in a long time, it always kept me hooked and I couldnt put it down. I hope he writes a sequel, mostly because the ending was sub-par. But other than that the book would be very hard to improve on. Excellent read!"
2,Well researched and informative but clearly rushed to print.,"Well researched and informative subject matter. However, the fiction surrounding the technical and graphic descriptions of the e coli bacteria and the meat industry is forced and predictable. Good for a quick read on a rainy weekend but not much more."
3,A missed opportunity,"Toxin provided Cook with a multitude of opportunities for the fright he likes to engender with the American medical landscape, but instead he goes so far over the top that it's too unbelievable to even produce unease much less fright. Taking on E coli and the American meat packing industry provided him with easy targets, but he elected to make a top-notch heart surgeon and turn him into a Jekyll and Hyde. While arrogance among doctors might be believable, the undisciplined and impulsive Dr. Kim Reggis was not believable at all. His actions his life's tragedy were even more unbelievable. The book was plotted well, however, so it was a pretty quick read, but the total implausibility of his main characters' actions robbed it of any punch it may have had."
1,Annoying ending (or lack of)!,"The doctor was such an unlikeable person. I couldn't even imagine that a surgeon could be such an uncontrollable idiot. And, the ending....where is it? Where'd they go, what happened?? It was my first Robin Cook novel and last."
1,The worst Robin Cook effort yet,"I have been reading Robin Cook for many years, some good, some fair but this is the first one that was so poor I couldn't finish it.I found the actions of the main character so over-the-top as to be cartoonish. 1/3 of the way into the book, there is very little story developed. As other reviewers have pointed out this seems to be more of an attack on the meat industry than anything approaching quality fiction."
3,"A good plot, but too much info for the weak at heart.....","This book has a great storyline, and plot to it. It's a wonderful book, until the part where Dr. Kim goes to work at the slaughterhouse. Robin Cook does a wonderful job displaying ever single little detail of what happens in slaughterhouses......... Too much information for those who are weak at heart, or have weak stomachs. It will definitely make you think twice before eating meat again.Overall, Cook did an excellent job writing the book. It was very intersting, and a page turner. But, just a little too many details."
4,"Cook Has a New Fan With 'Toxin""","Wow! 'Toxin' was the first medical thriller I had ever read, and I am happy to say that it won't be my last. Robin Cook has not only turned me into a fan with this book, but also into a vegetarian!I was handed this book by my friend (who also happens to be a vet) during vacation. I had finished it after three days - it was THAT riveting and impossible to put down. Cook really delves into the truths about meat processing in the US, and what can go wrong.After the E-coli breakout in my home town of Atlanta a couple years ago (during which several children died), this story really kicked me in the pants. Cook draws the reader in, and never lets up until all the secrets are out.If you enjoy the medical field and thrillers, then I would highly suggest this book. Although the ending is a little strange, it was still believable, and did not change my opinion of the story or the author."
5,Powerful Sound - Beautiful Vocals,"WOW! Powerful, powerful stuff. The band plays tight and determined and the lead vocals reveals a talent that will surpass the talented female singers you hear on the radio.It is clear to me that this band shines with talent. Annette has such a beautiful voice her sincerity rings through with the feelings she conveys through her songs. Mark Evangelista sets the bands power through his talent and finesse behind his drum kit. And the swirling guitars and the sound of determination in his playing reveals a lead guitarist to be reckoned with.Shut Up Marie's music is a force of sound that will make you want to turn it up! I highly recommend that one and all pick up a copy of DEMO. You will not be disappointed!"
5,Insider's view of Tokyo,"I loved this book even more than the author's first. The exciting story line pulled me through and I read it in 3 days. I thoroughly enjoyed the author's insider's view of Tokyo. Barry Eisler paints a believable picture of the intracacies of life in a big city that once seemed so foreign to me. I now have Tokyo on the top of my list of places to visit. I wonder what will happen next to the protagonist, John Rain?"
4,Great Adventure Tale Continues...,"Great writing, solid story, well developed characters, obviously well researched background and operational ""techniques"". I'll continue to read Eisler's Rain series."
5,Another great thriller from Barry Eisler!,"If your idea of a good read is The Secret Life of Bees, Hard Rain probably isn't the book for you. But as a hard core thriller fan who prefers action and lust to complex character development - I loved it! Eisler manages to bring a certain polish to his prose that isn't typical of most books centered around an assassin. Couple this with his amazing knack for describing places, tastes, smells, and even martial arts techniques at a visceral level - and you have a must-read book. Plan to read it on a long airplane trip, or over the weekend, otherwise you will be up all night. This isn't an easy book to put down once you get started..."
2,lost interest,I rarely stop reading a book once I start but I lost interest in this one after getting about 1/4 of the way into it. I kept hoping it would get better. Maybe it's me or the Japanese locations (I know nothing about Japan) but it just wasn't for me.
3,Meh.,"The good news is that my niece adores these dolls. The bad news is they are more anatomically ""suggestive"" than ""correct"". I got these for my niece for her third birthday because she was becoming very curious about the differences between boys' and girls' bodies. I chose these because they had the cutest faces of all the anatomically correct dolls I saw. As it turns out, they aren't much more anatomically correct than Barbie and Ken. Oh well. My sister ended up having to get my niece a children's book about human bodies to help explain things."
2,This album made me want to jump in front of a train--,"I won't go on and on about how Goodie has lost their soul with this one...you get the point. Everytime someone said ""Hip-Hop is dead"", I would respond with, ""We still have Outkast, Roots, and Goodie Mob"". I guess two out of three isn't bad..."
2,Not the Goodie MOb I Know,I just have to agree with most of the reviews that this album is nothing like the ones before. I am really disappointed!
2,"There not ""Still Standing"", and there is no ""Soul"" in this..","As an avid Goodie MOb fan I don't like the road they took with their latest release. I'd like to quote C-Lo from their first CD ""Soul Food"". He says "" I wish I had more, but I like being poor at least I know what my friends are for..."". But now they're ""Getting rich to this"". this CD is a complete 180 from there more home-grown roots in their '95 release. They're jumping on the ""money is everthing"" wagon, like such artists as Puff Daddy and other rine-stoned rappers. Ian Mitchell"
2,Not very good,Well you can't tell the hour unless you sit and study it for about 30 seconds and it scratches very easily and I wouldn't recommend buying this online as you most likely have to take it to get links out unless you have a gynormous hand and it's not worth $50. Go to target and buy yourself a nicer one for $20
4,Back to basics,"This is the fourth time I buy ""Cruising Guide to the BVI"", the first one was back in 1995. It continues to be the basic guide to sail in the area and the work Nancy and Simon Scott are doing to its constant updating and upgrading makes this guide an essential tool for anyone who loves to spend some time afloat in that sailing paradise. Congratulations to the authors. I'll hope to be there to buy the next edition!!"
1,"Nice Design, poor quality","I loved the tablet style of this player and it mounted quickly and easily on our headrest. The only problem is we only got about 6 hours out of it before it began skipping and freezing up (not a battery problem). The picture was a little blurry, but tolerable. The sound was not so good, but much better with headphones. It mounts wonderfully in a vehicle, now if it would only play movies!"
2,Many stories!,"This is a folk rock acoustic CD with lyrics about one romantic relationship after another. It has a nice philandering phlow, but sometimes it's off key."
3,Good Choice,I have greatly enjoyed using this book. Its a fun way to test your reading comprehension.You also will not find this kind of book in stores. Highly recommended
1,Way too fast,"These go way too fast for a student at the level for which they are intended. It is really very helpful to a new student to be able to practice with a better player or a recording, to help stabilize the pitch. These are so fast that not only can you not keep up and play with a nice sound, it is discouraging when you thought you were well on your way to mastering a piece, to be told in so many measures that it is meant to be twice as fast. Sorry for the blistering review, and I know you can buy software to slow things down but this should just be geared for beginners in the first place. Volume 1 and 2 are approximately the first six months of your cello career, the time for lots of encouragement and focusing on making a pretty sound."
1,Don't waste your money,"I've had this machine for a year now, and you know that scene in the movie ""Office Space"" where the guys take the printer out to a remote location and beat it to smithereens? Well that is exactly what I am doing with this lemon when I replace it.It does what it wants, when it wants to. Now it has taken to erasing what I've recorded when I try to access the disc or turn off the machine. Sometimes I cannot turn it off and have to unplug it to get it to reset itself and unfreeze. (It's not an Apple product, is it?:-)Most aggravating of all, (since it is a minor thing that could easily have been made right but was not,) is that the clock does not keep proper time. When you go to your manual to find out why, it tells you that it doesn't keep proper time and basically you can go jump in a lake if you don't like it.The dumpster for this one."
1,RCA products are JUNK,Stay away from Thompson RCA products. They a junk and the customer service is worse!!
3,Professorial,"It might have been called ""How to Write Jokes for College Professors Only. The elaborate coding of jokes is definetely post-graduate stuff. The average Joe who wants to write comedy or do comedy might prefer something simpler. Reminds me of ""Radio Comedy & How to Write It"" by Art Henley, (c) 1948. Art Henley uses all kinds of geometry in analyzing jokes. All quite professorial. But I enjoyed the book."
5,"Love, love, love it!","The product does everything and then some for helping to grow nails. I am so happy with the purchase as it has given me more hope I will have stronger and more lengthy nails. I have noticed since the first use my nails are starting to grow and become stronger which is exactly what I want. Very pleased with the purchase and the seller was awesome, will purchase from again!"
3,super chic shoe,"Super cute shoe - looks great - a little skimpy on support and comfort, however, but the look may be worth it."
4,handy little plates,"I love throwing cocktail parties, and these plates are perfect for having a small snack and holding your wine glass at the same time. Worked with all of my wine glasses that have stems, although I tried to balance a regular glass that had a rounded bottom in there and that wasn't very bright, stick with wine glasses!I use the acrylic versions of these plates as well, but these are perfect for cheese and fruit. I keep the acrylic ones in the cupboard in case I need extras, or if I'm serving something less easy to clean off of wood, these are definitely classier.Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is they aren't dishwasher safe I don't think. In my book everything should clean itself, and barring that at least be dishwasher safe."
1,Ick-does not smell as described,"I am not sure why people are so enthralled with this perfume. It smells cheap and musky, not at all like fruits or the beach. I was expecting a fabulous smelling perfume and instead I paid $30.00 for a perfume that smells like $4.00 at Walgreens. YUCK. Don't buy this unless you have smelled this before and like it both in the air and on your skin. There is not even a hint of fruit in this perfume. I wonder if I was sent an old perfume bottle? It came brand new in the box but it might be past its prime and that is why it smells horrible."
1,Really Dislike the Smell and Amazon won't let me return,"I bought this after reading all the positive reviews, but when I got the item, I really dislike the smell and it gives me a head ache. I can't even return it even though it was through Amazon Prime, because it is apparently classified as either a hazardous material or use flammable liquid. I am really at a loss as to how to get a refund or what I should do"
5,A staple scent,This is one of my favorite perfumes. I always get compliments on it. It's a very sexy scent.
2,Disappointing.,"I loved The Ring of Five Dragons. This book was a bit of a disappointment for me. It was well written and was pretty interesting, but it wasn't as good as the first book, and it was too...graphic."
4,Builds on the first book,Better than the first book. The cast of characters are expanded and fleshed out a little more. We see more development of a copule of the main characters and some minor characters from the first book step up. Also the scope of the story expands to include more than finding an artifact and saving the planet from doom. On the StuPage website I give it a B.
3,"Doco is a doco, life is a life.",It is an educative doco of t h e n Italian Mafia in the States.As any doco it is worth to be watched by liking a topic at first stage.
4,First five seasons of Hawai'i Five-0 ON DVD s set! Five of the best years of this great series! Pick Up On It!,Many great episodes with McGarrett/Danno/Chin Ho/Duke/Ben/Kono/Frank[Doug Mossman]in here. Highly recommended and with a lowerprice than purchasing each season by themselves!
2,one of the freakiest movies of all time,"after seeing this movie, i was scared. not screaming at the top of my lungs scared, but the scared where you sit there and think - oh my goodness. this movie is about a rich teenage boy (harold) who is obsessed with death. he attempts suicide multiple times and likes going to funerals. then he meets an old lady (maude) at a funeral and falls madly in love with her. theres gap of over 60 years between them, but they fall in love. it was horrifing in my opinion."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful & wonderful!","In an age of cynicism, bitterness, and pointless movies about horny teenagers, this film is a breath of fresh air. Movies like this simply do not get made anymore. People who hate it miss the point, it is about love and life and enjoying who you are. Movine and wonderful, and Ruth Gordon is darling. To those who hated it, please watch it again, and open your mind and your heart. You will be surprised at what you find there."
5,best love story ever told,"this film is quirky, sad, sweet, strange....if you haven't seen it, it is so worth the money!"
1,Boring,I didn't like this movie. Depressing scenes and overall boring slow uninteresting strange tiresome and not the kind of thing I want to spend my time watching.
5,One of the best movies,This is a classic. One of my most favorite movies of all time. I have loved it for over 20 years.
1,HAROLD AND FRAUD,this movie is a mix: a bloody movie and a sad story of friendship. sounds good huh? no its horrible. it has no plot. and why would a 16 year old have sex with an 80 yr old??????!!this movie is just sick. SICK I TELL YOU!!
2,Not for me,"I really could not get into this story. I don't really like ""dark"" comedy, so unless that is what you are into, this movie is probably not for you."
2,One of the best of it's time,"This is a movie that is way out of the scope for my age group but one viewing later I feel this movie has an overall feel for any generation. The sublties that this movie has is very introspective. I especially found the concentration camp tatoo on Maud's arm to be a very meaningful touch, almost like a motivation. This movie in my opinion is the greatest love story since Romeo and Juliet."
1,Don't waste your time!,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There was nothing funning about it. A complete waste of time...
1,Harold & Maude,This is the second time I have bought this movie and I keep getting mailed a United Kingdom version that will not play on American DVD players.I am out money for two movies and have no movie to show for it. I don't know what to do to correct this.Pam Davis
4,First time in about 40 years,Brings back memories from my youth when this had a two-year run in a local movie theatre. Offbeat humor and worth seeing.
3,Poor color quality,Time has not been kind to this classic. The color has faded in the print of this movie. The joy of watching is lessened due to washed out color. Once the film has been restored then please purchase it on dvd.
5,I seen it in theaters more then 20 times.,While living in San Francisco there were theaters that Showed this movie once a month and always drew a full theater.
3,Harold and Maude--the best,"This wasn't quite as good as I'd remembered it, but it was stilll great after all these years. One of my all-time favorite movies!"
1,Marcus Fleck,"I was in the joint with this guy. He's still there on another ""really nasty"" charge and I'm on the outside. He won't see daylight anytime soon. And it's always poor me."
3,Interesting and Frustrating: NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"I ran across this book recently and picked it up to see if it would be worthwhile to use in my intro to Photoshop class. While there are some interesting techniques, and I've picked up a few new things, it is so frustrating to figure out in parts that there is no way I can use this for my students. Some of the techniques they have outlined are incorrect, and I've ended up having to do things in my own way to achieve the desired results.One one hand, I can say this is a good thing because it makes me challenge myself in utilizing Photoshop's many features, which is why I gave it three stars. On the other hand, as an instructional text it fails... I can't even say I'd recommend it for an intermediate user."
1,disappointed in Sony,"Last year I bought two boomboxes from Amazon and they were fabulous. This year I decided to try the sony cfds22. I wanted black but they only had the silver left. I asked and was assured they were the same. I bought the unit based on the glowing customer review. Well I was wrong. I think it might be a product control issue as I am usually very pleased with sony products. Nevertheless my mega bass would turn off on its own and there was continual static whether I was playing the cd, tape or the radio. Perhaps there are some units out there that are great but I was not lucky enough to get one. Back to the POst office to ship this back."
2,What's With All The Shouting?,"I watched this expecting an awesome film experience, but all I got was people shouting at each other for 2 hours. What is with all the screaming? Is this really how people converse with each other in Italy? I hope not! I like a lot of Fellini movies and La Strada was very good, but this did impress me at all. Long and drawn out, this slice of live is no piece I want a part of. And I just don't get this part. If she had her purse stolen at the beginning of the movie by her lover, why would she carry a thousand times more in her purse later on and not expect the same? Not very street smart."
1,TERRIBLE!!,"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I cannot understand why people like it so much!Robert Townsend is not my favorite performer and why he would make this type of film is beyond me.The scene in which he and his sister are singing in the bedroom and he is handing her the pieces of paper with the words on them, please!NOPE! Don't waste your eye power watching this one."
5,The Five Hearbeats,"This has got to be one of the best movie I have ever seen. The music is fantastic and the acting is excellent. For anyone who loves that kind of music, this is a must have. What an amazing movie it is."
5,An Exceptional Movie,"This is the absolute best movie that I have ever seen. I am looking forward to the DVD. The movie touched on every emotion, demonstrated the true meaning of friend, and the power of the Church. The acting was great and the music was outstanding. This is a must see family movie."
5,One of My Favorites,"This is a great movie, great special effects and actors. One of my favorites, just had to have it. Great soundtrack also."
4,"Great songs, characters you will care about","The main reason to get this is to watch Tressa Thomas destroy when she belts out ""We Haven't Finished Yet."" The rest of it is still very good, but it's funny how a small girl steals the entire movie with one scene.The story is a good overview of what Motown had to go through to ""cross over"" and break color barriers. It's entertaining enough with likable characters, and it won't beat you over the head trying to drum up empathy. Definitely a must-see."
3,A Short Review.,"Well, having literally just finished watching this, I must say that this show left a lot of questions unanswered.The series starts off feeling like you've missed out on some important details, like you should already know what's going on. It's possible that this started out as a manga and evolved into an animated version of it, I'm not sure. Maybe I've overlooked something somewhere, but after checking several websites across the Internet, I haven't found any other information on it so far.The artwork in this is great. However, the storyline is a bit slow to develop and the ending was very unsatisfying for me. Flaws aside, it's still worthy of three stars."
1,Alferd Packer's Wilderness Cookbook.,"Not the book I read years ago. This isn't a cook book, it's a list of things to take on a camping trip! The book with the same title I read was a book of game and fish recipes!Somebody's shamming."
4,Almost fabulous,"A terrific concert. Would have given it 5 stars if sound had been redone in 5.1 or DTS. The stereo sound isn't as good as the One Night Only DVD of course, but it's certainly better than the vhs version. I hope those who describe the sound as ""bad"" tried to exchange the DVD for a better one."
3,"Buy ""Bee Gees: One Night Only' Instead!","I brought the DTS version of ""Bee Gees: One Night Only"" first and loved it (it's also my 2 year old daughter's favorite DVD)! Therefore, I was a little disappointed in the sound quality of this DVD. It sounds like the recording was done from a mike in the audience, as the vocals was not as clear as the One Night Only DVD. I would recommend the ""The Eagle: Hell Freezes Over"" DVD - a truly awesome recording!"
2,Works Well But Ruins Water's Taste,"I purchased this water cooler to replace one that I had rented from Poland Springs for seven years. This water cooler functions well. Hot water is hot enough to make tea or other hot drinks and the cold water is fairly cold. The problem is that the reservoir for the cold water is made of soft plastic and it makes the Poland Springs water that I pay dearly for taste like plastic. My previous rented water cooler had a stainless steel reservoir which did not affect the taste of the water. There is a stainless steel reservoir for the hot water, so it isn't as badly affected. The company assures me that the taste will ""go away eventually,"" but after several months, I'm not holding my breath. If I had it to do over again, I would definitely shop around for a water cooler that had ALL stainless steel reservoirs."
5,A well written biography about Julia,"This book is a well written biography about Julia and a collector's item fof Julia's Fans. I liked it very much, especially because it wasn't too long."
2,politically correct and lame,"This is the most disappointing collection of Best American Essays I have read in a decade. Most seemed included because they take a particular greeny-wishywashy-save the worldy point of view, not because they are outstandingly original or thoughtful meditations on their subjects. Some are pretentious (Jamaica Kincaid), most are just wet. Ian Buruma's on The Perils of Victimhood is about the only one that will stand the test of time."
1,Designed for only some Q's!,"I am sure this is a wonderful cover for a Q2 or maybe the Q series from Sprint. However it does not fit a Q9c. The battery DOES fit all the Q's! So I am keeping mine for the battery. The battery is an original Motorola. I will duct tape the battery inside my phone because I am desperate! Just be sure to make sure your Q back is a half-back with a clip, and that the phone is NOT a Q9x."
1,Problem with setup,"Nice looking printer and came with good documentation. My problem was I couldn't get it to talk to my computer. I tried the parallel connection and the USB. Epson email support was great. They responded in less than 24 hours, but I tried everything they suggested and still couldn't get it to work. After 3 days I gave up and returned the printer. I went out and bought an HP and had it set up and running in 15 minutes so all I can figure is that the one I got was defective."
3,Good information but poorly written.,"The book contains a lot of great information. It is worth the effort if you want to mine it for facts and ideas. Unfortunately, the authors love passive, detached sentences. There is also to many ""on the one hand, but on the other hand"" discussions, which leave your wondering if there really is a point to the whole thing."
1,Nothing revolutionary about this!!,"Toffler's book is a disappointing money maker for the Toffler brand. This book should be titled ""In praise of Volunteerism"", which the author calls prosumerism. Unless you live under a stone, everybody already know the stories of Napster, VOIP, Linux etc. The objective of buying a book is to learn something new, not to hear well-known stories re-packaged with new buzz word. Why preach the obvious? For example, we all agree we live in a more complex, time starved and connected world than anytime before. No argument or new insight there. Compared to the book ""The World Is Flat"" by Tom Friedman, this book is not well-researched and fails to expand your thinking."
2,What a racket,"How many variants on a theme are permitted before one says 'nuff? The Toeflers continue to thrive on gullibility. Who believes that each approaching decade will transform mankind's nature? Too many each decade, it appears."
2,Messy,"I didn't realize these bones had a layer of meat-like product. This layer crumbles and scatters all over the place and is bright red. On the plus side, my puppy loves it. Would not purchase again though, because it's such a mess"
5,AMAZONICO,"Lo mejor de soda, impresionante, historia del rock en espanol, son duda para amantes de la musica en espanol"
1,what a business,"My first razor lasted me 20 years without any replacement blades.It was a self sharpening. Now, they found it much more profitable toreplace the blades every year.I've looked for razor with self sharpening blades. I wouldn't mindpaying a little more up front for it, but they don't make them any more.My blades are pretty much unusable after one year now. I have to buya new replacement set for $39.Next, I think they'll discontinue the old blades, forcing you to buy a newrazor as well."
4,Another Funky One,"I like Grant Green's funky period. This is a great cd from that period; and ""Green is Beautiful"" is great too. Idris Muhammed is the greatest funky jazz drummer of all time. Essential groove music."
1,Returned it,"Well, I decided I wanted an alarm clock with the option to wake up to a cd, so I thought this one looked good. Got it home, had no problems setting the times on it, then got to the part of the instructions where you set the cd alarm function... thats where I discovered that you can't program the stupid thing to wake you up to any song on the cd, it will only play the first track on the disc for the alarm function. Ridiculous.Also, I did have a chance to listen to a song on it; the sound quality was not so great, but I figured hey, its an alarm clock, I'm not planning on using it to listen to music much on it, thats what my stereo is for. Anyway, I returned it less than 24 hours later."
2,1 worked the other didn't,"I ended up buying two at the same time. One to put in the bathroom (perfect since it had a clock, a CD player and it was small) and the other for the office. Ironically the one I bought for the office which I use the least is already broken. The CD player doesn't work. It's pretty much useless to me now at the office. The one in the bathroom is still working fine; we use it frequently and haven't had a problem since we got it.I've concluded there's only a 50 50 chance it'll work. :)"
3,Not great but tolerable,"I've had this for a few years and it has a few good features. For example, you can wake up to CD, radio, or buzzer, and you can pick the song you want to wake up to. Also, the snooze timer can be changed to however long you want and it is not just a standard time.There are a few faults too. The most annoying thing about it is that it is VERY sensitive to cell phones. It clicks and buzzes when anyone nearby's cell phone is about to ring. It gets very irritating living in a dorm full of cell phones going off. It also only has one alarm setting, which is okay, but if you want to take an afternoon nap, you have to change your morning alarm.My recommendation is to continue to shop around before you settle on this clock."
1,I liked it...for the five months it worked!,"I tried 3 or 4 clock radio CD players, but returned them when I discovered that you could go to sleep to the CD player or wake to the alarm, but not both. How stupid is that??? I was pleased that the Emerson did both and was reasonably priced. The buttons were somewhat awkward, but I was generally happy with the unit until the CD player stopped working after only 5 months. Of course, the warranty is only for 90 days. Very disappointing..."
4,Pretty Decent,"This is a pretty decent alarm clock. Its pretty cool because when the alarm goes off all you have to do is hit the power button and the alarm is still set for the next day. The buttons are a little small and are kind of a pain to press when setting the time and alarm, but hopefully you wont have to change the times that much. The sound is good, of course its not stereo material, but for a clock radio its pretty good. Overall its a decent clock."
2,Home Video,"Mitsuru Okabe made this video cheaply, Dexter Jackson talks to his head set, he talks to the camera at other times, and his girl friend is off camera talking to Dexter and he's answering her during taping. It's confusing when Mits talks off camera without any sound and Dexter starts talking as if the viewer knows who he's talking to or what he's talking about.Watching Jay Cutler's video From Jay to Z, I decided to try a Dexter Jackson video because Jay to Z was a home video. Dexter Jackson's DVD The Blade 2K7/2k is an unedited home video with some local business advertisements and less interesting than Jay Cutler.Luckily I bought this used for $17.00."
1,Caveat Emptor!,"This book is clueless and exploitative, and has absolutely no basis in the reality and tradition of cowrie shell divination. Clearly nothing more than a bid for bucks, by an author who is counting on the ignorance of his audience."
5,Great resource!,This is a great little handbook. It is especially helpful for citation and bibliography. I've had it all through college and now past that and refer to it often.
5,"Great DVD, Great seller","Great DVD, I'm a diehard Odd Couple fan!!! Great seller, quick shipping, would buy from again."
3,Cheapskates,"Less 2 stars due solely to the editing of content.I am in complete agreement with other buyers about the edits and I use the word ""complete"" literally, unlike Paramount/CBS when they say ""The COMPLETE Final Season"". In a previous season, an entire gag about trying to get Felix to go to sleep (featuring the song ""Dream"") was cut. This season, one of my favorite episodes, ""Strike up the band or else..."" had gags cut involving the song ""In Some Secluded Rendezvous""(sung twice in the show by Tony Randall and Pernell Roberts). How expensive can these songs be that you have to butcher these episodes. Charge a little extra with the guarantee that all the episodes are intact and you'll sell just as many if not more."
1,the odd couple the final season,"this final season video stinks to high hell.why does it have to be severely edited .the best parts of the episodes is to see it in its complete form.if i knew it was severly edited like this i would have never purchased it. ""I FEEL CHEATED"" WHAT A GYP. THE SCENE WITH PERNELL ROBERTS SINGING WAS EDITED OUT AND MY FAVORITE PART OF OSCAR SINGING, SINGING IN THE RAIN WHEN HE WAS FINALLY RID OF FELIX WAS CUT OUT. WHY DO THAT TO US ODD COUPLE DIE HARDS .WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE COMPLETE EPISODES. I FOR ONE AM VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THIS FINAL EPISODES CD. IT STINKS TO HELL.not recommended till deleted scenes are put back in.ROBERT C."
3,"Oh, how I'd love to give all 5 stars, BUT.........","It goes without saying that The Odd Couple is a classic TV sitcom and that Randall & Klugman were a great comedy team. What a SHAME that Paramount has issued these wonderful shows with edits that stick out like a sore thumb! It's actually painful to watch as episode-ending gags are TOTALLY WIPED OUT simply due to music issues. One would assume that some of these songs are in public domain by now, but really -- comedy is about timing and these edits screw around with the timing. This collection SHOULD HAVE gotten a 5-star rating, but the edits are just too painful. Tony Randall must be turning over (neatly) in his grave......"
1,Beware! The Reader Reviews are the Real Mystery,"This is one of the poorest books I've ever read: poorly written, poorly plotted, even poorly printed (very shabby job). I was AMAZED at the reviews on this site, so, in the spirit of a mystery, a better one than the author devised in his embarrasing, amateurish book, I did some sleuthing. I looked up the reviews of his other books. Funny thing: Lady named Harriet Klauser LOVED em all! Friend of the author, Harriet? Then I noted all the other good reviews came from the San Fernando Valley. More friends? Seeing a pattern here folks? As for the book itself, the dialogue is pathetically [bad]. When it tries to sparkle, it makes your toes curl. The plot is beyond implausible, to say nothing of boring. And the exploitation of a dead genius, in this dweeby, schoolboy mystery schlock, is, finally, distasteful. If you love the Beatles, or John Lennon, or good books, or mysteries, or anything, BEWARE! You have been warned."
2,not good,"this movie was extremely boring.. not good at all.. it came in timely manner... but i read the reviews before i brought this movie.. and it was very misleading.. not good, no theme.. didn't make sense."
5,Garry Marshall is a comedy genius and his book proves it!,"This book is a must for Garry's fans. It's funny and heartfelt. The forward, written by sister Penny, is hilarious. This book lets us all into the heart of one of America's funniest men. I have read this book half a dozen times and am looking forward to reading it again. If you love Garry, you'll love this book."
1,this book was a joke,I Honestly could not believe that this was rated higher then one by anyone! The hero was basically an abused male the heroin was a complete schrew. She was mean from the start for no reason other then her own attraction. He never treats her wrong and she is always snapping at him! Then to make it worse she starts meddling in others affairs and decides that he is the reason for her sisters possible failed engagement. So she drugs him and then basically rapes him and the leaves him high and dry handcuffed to bed.On top of rolling your eyes at the excessive drama that has no place the story itself is poorly written. I wished in the end that the hero threw the heroin in jail and ran off with someone better after leaving her to rote.I am pretty sure this is the worst story I have ever read.
4,Babyshower gift,"I have not seen any babies playing with this toy so I can't review it in that capacity but what I can say is that the person I bought this for thought this was a very cute toy for her baby. The only drawback is that the birds have eyes that can come off. Babies really like the crinkly squishy shapes, and it would have been better if the birds didn't have eyes that can come off and become choking hazards. It says its for babies 8 months and above probably because of the eyes. Of course any babies younger wouldn't know how to use the shape sorter but they would probably enjoy feeling the birds and squishing them and chewing on them. Without the eyes I think this toy would be for a broader age range."
5,Best of the 4 so far...,this is do good! i spent hours playing this! i was so excited about gh3 and when i bought it i was greatly disappointed- they just completely added so many bad features and took away so many good ones. but i just went back to this one. it is the best game i have ever played (except gta)
1,"A personal case study, not a guide","I'm not sure about this edition of this book, but the earlier edition was a huge letdown. Instead of an actual guide with points and explanations, this book was a case study based on student experiences and internships. For those seeking to become truly good policy writers and thinkers, I recommend The Eightfold Path by Eugene Bardach. But again , please note this is based on earlier editions, not this one."
3,I've seen better...,"The Song of the Lark was definately an interesting novel with a simple, yet developed plot. The characters were absolutely fascinating! Still, I found it inconcievably laborious to read. The pages drew on and on, taking an entire section (2 hours of my time) to basically lay out the statement, ""Thea gets away on vacation, falls in love with ____ (no spoilers!), and returns to the city refreshed and happy."" Though the descriptions were well written and intersting, they totalled all-in-all to purely ostentatious. So I found the whole thing about mediocre, but I'll give Cather one thing--Classic literature is NOT my thing, and by reading this I may be inclined to select another of her books in the distant future, as I need time to escape the dullness. Wierd or not after this review, I recomend the novel."
1,too bad,"Although it looks good, its quality is too bad and coarse.It is very loose. Such a product does not even worthy $1.And useless!I would not recommend such product."
3,Small Wrench Good for Some Situations,"This wrench is very small, which can be handy in some situations where there is limited space for a larger handle.Overall construction feels solid, although there are some shortcomings.Pros:-------------+ Small size can be helpful sometimes.+ Grip on handle is nice and well made.+ Opening width is excellent for the wrench size.Cons:-------------- Small size makes it difficult to get any leverage, and may be an issue if you have large hands.- As others have said, the grip of the jaws loosens during use.- There are better wrenches for this price."
5,"Simple, easy to use",Easy to operate and does the job right for basic home needs and slightly heavy duty work like fixing my bicycle. Its sturdy and I am sure it can handle more harder fixing stuff.. Must have home tool.
1,nice paint by numbers,"I did one like this for my grandma it was paint by numbers, so I think this is too high priced."
5,Now this is music !!,"Beautiful lyrics and very well composed. On a stressful day, this music will definitely relax you and take you to a whole different world. One of my favorite music cds."
2,Not a good first ASP.net or C# book,"This book tends to become scattered, and the author seems to ramble at times. I was expecting more simple explanation by example, but what examples there were seemed to contain large amounts of code that belonged in an entirely different topic. I tended to notice alot of ""I'm showing you this, but I'm not going to say anything about it in this book.""...This is not to say that there is no useful information in this book, but it is difficult and tiring to get to. The content seems to drift towards generalized advice in many areas, rather than actual instruction.I would say that this book would be worth owning only if you have a good core of ASP.net knowledge, and want a book that will increase the dsetail of your knowledge in a wandering manner."
3,Worth the Effort,"This book was not written for the lay reader of science, such as myself. At times the writer sounds as if, chalk in hand, he is giving a lecture to astrophysics third-year students - the only thing missing is the pronunciation of the equations. Those uncomfortable with formulas will find the middle of the book slow going.The payoff, for those who persevere, is two or three new ideas. And that's why we read books like this."
1,A Genesis Reunion Is the Only Hope,... That thump you are hearing is a once dignified career hitting rock bottom. This is so worthless I had to make sure it was actually Phil Collins the musician and not Phil Collins the insurance broker giving music a shot late in life. ...
3,(no title),"depending on your mood, I think its good if your melow. Its not a fast CD. Good for a low background music."
4,A beautiful album...,"This new release by the extraordinary artist Phil Collins is a joy. It is more subdued and toned down than previous efforts...this one is very quiet and mellow, perfect for a rainy day or drive down the open road. It has some real radio friendly gems like the fun uptempo DRIVING ME CRAZY or the beautiful and emotional YOU TOUCH MY HEART and COME WITH ME....the whole cd is a very pleasant listen....I just wished there had been a few more uptempo songs....but still a great cd!"
2,Disappointing.,"As a huge PC/Genesis fan (in high school I owned nothing *but* Genesis and Phil Collins albums!), I was pretty excited when I saw that PC had released a new album, so I snatched it up. I wasn't too thrilled with ""Dance"" but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. But disppointment was all that awaited me.As mentioned by other reviewers, the music is generic, contains very little lyrical ""grit"" and is overly synthesized. One of the biggest reasons I used to enjoy PC's music was for the sheer power in his drumming. The man used to play ""with his heart on his sleeve"" but it seems that Phil thinks that ""the old days are gone, and they're better left alone.""I know we all mellow-out a bit as we get older, but this is ridiculous. The only reason I'm not throwing this CD away is because I paid good money for it. If you grew-up listening to Phil Collins through the late 70's (in Genesis) and early 80's (when he went solo), you'll probably want to bypass this one."
2,Collins' descent into utter blandness is nearly complete,"I really wish I had spent my money on something else and not this CD. (Those who think it's impossible for Phil to make bad music should probably stop reading at this point.) I used to really enjoy and appreciate his songs, especially back in the late '70s and early '80s with Genesis, and his first couple of solo albums. I remember when a new Phil Collins Cd was a cause for excitement. Now every song is full of light and fluffy synthesizers, and the melodies are so forgettable. They have no more staying power than a breeze through the trees in my back yard. There's really no point in talking about individual songs -- if you think of his songs for children's animated films, this album is like that only worse. Listening to this CD was a very similar experience to listening to elevator music for an hour."
1,Nothing new here,This is just the usual Phil Collins singing in a whimpery voice mostly sugary sweet bad pop songs and one bad cover song.
3,I thought I was buying a book on CSS Design,"This book reads like the authors tricked the publishers into letting them write a book on CSS Design, when they really intended to write a book on design theory. That's cool and all, but I wanted a book on CSS Design. I already have better books on design theory.The CSS examples were helpful, but sparse in the book. There was plenty of going on about typefaces to use, colors, and artwork, though.All in all, it was only moderately helpful."
5,Wonderful Layouts,This book is fantastic for layouts and suggestions. While it is not the simplist thing for the beginner it is very good for layouts and suggestions on ways to make your own CSS better and HTML lighter.
1,Very Disappointed what a waste of money,"I just a pretty bookIs not a CSS book at alllot's of pretty sites maybenot for the begginer or advanced css builderI gave this book 1 star, in the future I wont buy anything from the same authors.All the good reviews are untrue false big lies!"
2,Interesting but bland,"This is an odd sort of book, written by the creator of the CSS Zen Garden, which is a masterwork.The CSS Zen Garden is a place where beauty and craft meet, and sometimes in absolutely brilliant ways; that's the beauty aspect; however, this book is about the craft aspect not beauty, which is disappointing.All of the designs that are described are good examples of the various design subjects being discussed, such as typography or the use of color. But for all that they exemplify craft, they are all also rather bland.Missing from this book are the designs that are beautiful. The most egregious omission is Mozart, which is one of the most visually arresting designs I have ever seen on the whole of the Internet, to say nothing of this site.Other overlooked beautiful designs are Odyssey, Dark Rose, Invitation, C Note, Egyptian Dawn and Mediterranean. The book is much the worse for omitting these designs."
3,"Let's review, one more time","This is important to understand: this is not a book that will teach you the fundamentals of CSS. Repeat, NOT a primer on CSS. Rather, it is a book aimed at users who want to write or improve the aesthetics of their website by incorporating CSS. For that reason, it is fairly solid. Most of the premises are fairly basic and straightforward, covering the usual elements of type, layout, images, grids, etc. It is a decent resource for ideas and perhaps some alternative ways to approach building or rebuilding your site (using CSS presumably). Advanced designers would probably want to look elsewhere for ideas, theories and techniques.If you want to understand what CSS is really about, in terms of writing it (to make your site as pretty as the examples in this book) you should turn elsewhere, like Eric A. Meyer's book on the subject. And you can easily check out the publisher's website and probably see everything you need to that is in this book."
3,Contractor Grade...,"One inch blade pays out to 11'+ before kink...Will handle three falls from an eight foot ladder...but not four! ( So I bought another.) Is ""Stanley"" aware there are hundreds of mechanics who would buy a 40 foot Titanium Fat Max?"
2,"Plastic, Plastic, Plastic","I own a couple Stanley measures and now that I've had this one for a couple months I can say with some confidence that even though the extra width of the tape allows you to extend the tape further than a narrower tape, the other drawbacks exceed this benefit.So, the cons:1) the end of the tape is not firmly riveted to the tape, so you won't get accuracy to the 1/16, probably not to the 1/8th hooking or pushing the end to anything. You would have to start at 1"" and go back from there.2) The body is plastic. I don't drop stuff unintentionally often. But sometimes my hands are full and I need to drop something a foot or two. With the metal case stanleys, it's never a problem. This tape, as other reviewers have said, is not strong enough to take much typical construction wear and tear. The case, after a couple months, is already a little loose, and that's just from frequent home use.So, all in all, not a real good buy for the frequent tape user, sorry to say."
2,Bad Lock,"I like everything about this tape except for the poorly designed lock. The lock works fine if you're just setting the tape on a flat board, but if you need to hang it over the edge of your work piece, the lock automatically releases and the tape falls to the floor. That's a big pain especially when you're on a wall."
2,"Clip too small, had to buy a pouch to hold it.","Although its nice to have a 40 foot measure, its big and much too big for the small clip on it.I had to buy a pouch to keep it on my belt."
