1,Neither Light nor Darkness!,"Having read most, if not all, of Milton Osborne's previous books on Cambodia and S.E. Asia, I found this book a big disappointment. The author seems to have re-written chapters from a previous book and added a few new ones but did not undertake new research for this book about Prince (now King) Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia. I served as Private Secretary to King Sihanouk from 1981-1991 and I believe that the Cambodian monarch is a much misunderstood monarch. Certainly not a perfect human being but neither a ""prince of darkness"". It is a great pity that Osborne does not pay much attention to Sihanouk's leading role in bringing a certain peace to Cambodia."
5,Artifacts galore!,This is/was a very good show reminding me of the magical artifacts recovered by Indiana Jones ... and that anything can happen in the hands of regular people ...
5,great show.,"As always, this show comes up with some fantastic plot ideas. I enjoy learning about the new ""artifacts"" that appear in each episode. The characters are even more interesting this season with new ones showing up."
3,"Not As Interesting As The Movie, Not As Informative As The Book.","My introduction to Charlie Wilson was through the movie starring Tom Hanks. This however got me interested enough to look for both the book and the History Channel documentary. The documentary while interesting dove tailed in some ways almost too closely with the movie. It is only after about the half way point that it goes into greater detail about what really happened, and even still it offers only a bare bones sketch compared to the book. While I do think the documentary is interesting and worthwhile, I would recommend it as a companion to the movie and book, as I do not think it is strong enough on its own merits."
5,Take the leap!,"Faith Prince is super-talented and adorable and I love this CD to death. The song selection is wonderful and quirky. The patter is PERFECT--not too much, not too little, just right. Her anecdote about Sacramento Music Circus (which I've attended) is a total scream and not to be missed. Ditto her jazzed-up ""Adelaide's Lament""."
4,Works reasonably well,"The unit works as advertised. As some other reviewers have pointed out, there is some background noise, but this unit is no worse than the Belkin unit I had before it. It does turn on instantly when it is plugged into the power socket in my car, which is not that case with the Belkin."
3,I guess you get what you pay for...,"This provides a very cheap solution to a very annoying problem - no mp3 plug on the dash of my car. The wire acts like an antenna to your ipod and picks up a great deal of spark plug noise. Cincinnati does not crowd the bandwidth too badly so I rarely need to switch it. It's a cheap thing to get me by until I find a better solution. Not well made - I am sure when I pull it out that it will break. All that being said, a total godsend over radio."
1,DOA,"Defective. Amazon policy is that returns are accepted in ""original packing"" which has to be destroyed in order to find out that the product is inoperative."
2,I disagree with the ratings,this looked and felt like someone's home video of there trip to Egypt. not worth the money at all
5,What a great Dame!,"Lena Horne remains one of the great song stylists - gorgeous to look at and gorgeous to listen to. This was a true lady who left a superb legacy. The presentaion of the disc is not great, but it still belongs in a music library."
4,I'm Not So Sure About Modes,"This is a great book. In spite of the fact that it deals with a very narrow area, it is instructive to someone who is new to CBT.One of the postulates of the book is the existance of modes. They state that when someone is in a manic state (mode), they will have ideas about a particular subject. When they are in the depressive stte (mode) they will have depressive ideas about the same particular subject. If one provides CBT in the depressive mode and moderates depressive beliefs about something, when the person's mood becomes elevated, their beliefs in about the same subject will likewise be more moderate. I havn't heard of this hypothesis since and I recon the reason is that it is not true!"
4,Best Baby Keepsake Book,"I have looked all over for the perfect baby book and this seems to be it. I love it because it goes all the way to high school graduation instead of just the first year. After the regular first year milestones, it goes through each school year leaving spaces for sports teams, activities, etc. Can't wait to fill it in."
4,Epic Pseudo Heels,"These boots are amazing. The platforms make it appear as though you are wearing high heels, when in fact you're basically walking on flat feet. Super warm and comfortable. They look amazing. My only complaint is that they are narrow at the calf, and the first time I wore them I literally had to stuff my calves inside and pray the zippers did not break. However, after wearing them for 7 hours, the fabric stretched and they are now much easier to put on. I am in love with these boots."
5,El Verdadero Leon - Excelente CD del Rey de la Salsa,"Excelente trabajo del Rey de la Salsa, Oscar, el unico"
3,Consider before you buy,"This collection provides a lot of viewing-time at a reasonable price, IF that is what you want. After viewing the whole set, about half of these productions are to my liking, and the others I have no desire to watch again. So consider, do the math, then decide."
5,awesome reggae,I saw this band in concert in 1976 in California when they were on tour playing all the songs from this album. This is still my favorite reggae band and a must for reggae lovers. Every tune is awesome!
4,WAR IN SPACE REPLACEMENT DISCS,"We found a problem with the War in Space video encode and it happened to late to solve the problem before some of them were shipped out. Unfortunately this initial batch of War in Space discs with video encoding problems were released into the marketplace. If you encounter a disc with video problems please return your defective disc only, (please do not return the case or cover) to this address:Discotek MediaWar in Space Replacement522 Hunt Club Blvd. PMB 338Apopka, FL 32703Please include your name and address with your return. We will ship you a fully working replacement ASAP. We are very sorry for the inconvenience."
3,Low budget...,"Direct Tv is showing this concert in the month of June, although it is not the full show(Direct tv is notorius for this practice)just the concert itself. Picture quality is a nasty brown sepia-tone complete with artifacts that make it look like an old battle-scarred film print. Not a happy viewing experience particularly for the dvd format. Song selection is fair with the stranger tunes being performed as well as a few kinda-unplugged versions. The band performs well and Tate sings as well as can be expected. Sound quality is in-your-face-typical-grunge-loud(but this is via Direct tv)and I doubt the actual dvd sounds much better. No surprises here just a pasted together collection of songs. The concert on Direct tv lasts about 56 minutes."
2,Maybe they should do a cover album,"The only thing that saves this DVD from being a complete waste of money is the encore with Dream Theatre on the Who's ""We Won't Get Fooled Again""."
1,"I've not seen this, but I'll share my thoughts anyway!","I've not seen this DVD, but judging from most of the reviews, I'm not going to make it a priority! Anyway, I saw QR live on this tour, and there is no way a black and white DVD will do the show justice! I applaud QR for having the guts to tour with one of the best progmetal bands in the world, Dream Theater! If that's not enough, they've did a short leg of this years tour with Symphony X...man these guys are brave! With that being said, I have one question for the Ryche boys. How can you tour with both Dream Theater and Symphony X, and not feel ashamed of your current output? If you don't know who Symphony X is, do yourself a favor and check out this band...they'll blow you away!"
4,The Journal that Rocks!!!!!,"The book The Journal of Ben Uchida is agreat book. It starts out with Ben coming home from school,and his entire family is sitting around the radio. From the speaker you could heara dfantic talker talker saying,""The Japs are coming,the Japs are coming. So that night his had to burn all Japanese items. The next morning two men came to Ben's house Dad let them in. The two men were wearing raincoats on a sunny day. They took Ben's father away, and the next day they came back and took Ben,his Mom,and his sister to a prison camp. To find out what happens read this book"
2,Life At a different Type of Camp,"The book that I read described the living conditions in a Japanese boy&#65533;s interment camp during WWII. At first his father is taken away. Then he is moved to an interment camp. It is the every day life of Ben Uchida in an interment camp, a small 25ft by 20ft apartment with one other family. He was lucky that he had to bunk with a nice respectable family that he did move in with. Besides his little neighbor, Jimmy who at the begging is always crying and screaming for his little dog. Ben makes a few friends. He and his friends form a baseball team, which turns out to be the best in the whole camp.I did not enjoy this book at all. It was so dull, monotonous, and boring. All it told about was about having to waiting in lines, baseball and the basic conditions of the camp. Besides that he would always talk about how the people were all there and how he was never going to leave and that the government would keep him there forever."
5,An accurate historical review.,"I have spent my early years in the Minidoka Internment Camp in Idaho. This book was very accurate in its description of daily life and conditions. The Epilogue provided a fine closure to the characters depicted in the book, and the historical notes and photographs enhanced the story of Ben. This event has too long been a skeleton in the closet of American history, and to a democratic society such as ours, respect and honor comes from the truth of telling. Congratulations to the author for a piece of historical fiction told with compassion and honesty."
4,"What is ""emo""?","""Emo"" is such a wimpy word to describe this band and record. The Promise Ring, fresh off of their last album ""Very Emergency"", have put out new material on ""Electric Pink"". Although it may not be their finest work since ""Nothing Feels Good"", it shows that the band is dedicated to the fans by putting out fresh songs for the band's rabid followers who have craved more since ""Very Emergency"". It is worth a listen for those who want to start listening to the Promise Ring, and a must have for the fans."
5,more fun from the promise ring,if you liked the very emergency or boys and girls you'll love this album by the promise ring. its energetic and catchy and not too heavy.The lyrics aren't quite as cryptic as the early albums but they might make you laugh. it might not make you cry but you might be bobbing your head and singing along.........
3,Good introductory text,"This was the required text for a course I TAed. I found the text useful for preparing my own lectures, as it often reminded me of ideas I would have 'taken for granted' among my students, although I found derivations often uncompelling and examples often glossing over subtle points. Also, examples and homework problems seemed predominantly to explore only straightforward applications of course concepts. I imagine, however, that many students at this level (freshmen bio, geo, and non-science majors) would prefer this kind of treatment, which is why, considering also this text's clarity and simplicity of presentation, I gave the above four star rating.Students who consider themselves more analytically inclined would be wise to consult instead Purcell. In fewer words Purcell describes E&M more clearly and more completely, with interesting examples and homework problems which evoke a fuller understanding of the theory."
2,Not a balanced view point,"If you are in the market for a timeshare this book is what you are wanting. If you are looking for reasons to not buy one (such as they are a bad investment) don't bother. Ms Schreier knows her business, but is obviously the victim of years of ""brainwashing"" that these ""products"" are a good deal for everybody."
2,Lot's of failed burns,"I am on my second drive now, the first had to be sent back. It barely worked and finally the tray wouldn't even open. The first and current drive had many failures. I mostly burn DVD's of home movies and have had to throw out as many DVD's as have been successfully burned. I now use the lightscribe for labeling only. I have burned one good label out of 1 attempt on the replacement drive, the first drive failed 2 out of 3 attempts. The old Plextor external DVD drive has been much more reliable burning DVD's. I have yet to try a burn of a CD, but would assume it works fine for that, but that's not the real reason to own one of these drives. I have not yet tried a dual layer, but based on current results, I would not expect it to perform well."
2,"Burn DVD ""Labels""? Oh really?","I've yet to see any blank DVDs for sale that are compatible with this Lightscribe system. CDs, yes, but DVDs? Not even on HP's website. Search Amazon and you'll find a product from Memorex that is, suspiciously, not available. Wish they'd change the promotional copy, or, if I'm missing something, I wish they'd make it clear where to find inScribeable DVDs.I've used it for a couple of CDs, and it does look kinda cool, but it takes a long time, particularly at the advanced quality setting (don't bother, you'll hardly notice a difference), but I wouldn't base a computer purchasing decision on it. It came standard on my new Pavilion A1039n, which is doing great so far, no complaints-- unlike the lemon A630n which I purchased 1.30.05 and am STILL fighting with HP about."
1,Not impressed,"After reading this book, I have to admit I am very disappointed.The text is superficial and has no in-depth gems to share. There are no references to information that can be found on this topic on Microsoft's website. A good study guide should, in my opinion, learn students how to find information on their own.The CD exam contains errors (I found two cases where the case studies and the questions don't match up, making the 'exam' practically useless).My recommendation is to steer well-clear of this one."
2,hp scanjet 5490,"this model comes with the 25 page ADF and transparency adapter. The scanner is technically impressive -- when it works. I had to return the scanner itself 30 days after I purchased it, with only light usage-- and it was replaced with a remanufactured model. So far (30 days later) the scanner still seems to be working, but the ADF failed--was sent a new one--which never worked, and am now waiting for a third one.Very disappointed with ""the new HP"""
1,A Toy,"Basically worthless. Burned up several bits trying to cut circles in 1/4"" and even 1/8"" Masonite. Money wasted. It would probably work with thin softwood."
3,Dremel Circle Cutter,"The Dremel Circle cutter is a handy accessory to the basic Dremel tool, and it is adequate for the job for which I purchased it.It is cheaply made and rough and a bit awkward to use. It is also cheap in price, so I cannot complain too much.I value tools, and would have paid more for a better tool, and would been more satisfied.In sum, it does the job, and I am being fussy."
2,It kinda worked,This is a great idea. I needed to cut some circles with my dremel and this seemed to be the perfect solution. The measurement markings on the side are a little hard to read and the bit it is supplied with broke fairly quickly.
4,"Cheaply made, but works","I'm surprised at how well this works considering the body is all plastic. The depth adjustment is held by a screw driven into the plastic body... That's going to fail with heavy use, but it is working for now. The measurements on the tool are pretty useless, but simply using a scale/caliper to set everything works. Cant complain to much because it's cheap and gets the job done. I used this to route flush mount speaker driver cut outs in 3/4"" plywood, took about 4 passes to get all the way through. You have to make sure to vacuum out the work area while cutting as it didnt extract the wood while it was cutting."
5,It cuts circles,"It makes perfect circles easy. the supplied bit cuts through MDF and particle board king of slow but it makes speaker holes real easy, and precise. good by jigsaw."
2,Not so great,"If you think you are going to be able to make a perfectly smooth circle like from a drill operated hole saw, forget about it. If you just need to rip an approximate circle that isn't so pretty because you are going to cover with a beauty ring (like for recessed lighting) it will work fine. It is awkward to use and no matter how much I tightened the guide and made starter holes the exact size of the guide pin, it still resulted in a jagged hole. Granted I am wanting a perfect circle in a piece of wood that is smooth inside to hold an object that is round and thus aesthetics are important but they don't make a hole saw in the sizes I need. This wasn't the tool for the job."
5,works well on ceiling tiles too,I needed to cut holes for can lights in ceiling tiles. Super. I also had to trim tiles to fit and plastic lenses for overhead lighting. The guide was perfect for the job.
2,Home printing at its worst,"If you are thinking of buying this book, save your money. Neither the research into this subject nor the quality of the printing is worth it. The book appears to be a cut-and-paste collection of images that appeared in antique books. The quality is so poor that many of the black-and-white images are blurry (low resolution on computer scanner?)and show black lines at the edges like a poor photocopy. Nor is the book comprehensive. All in all this book seems to have been published at home...."
2,syndicalism in many more words,"Well researched and well presented. BUT...Just another look at the progressive syndicalist, [i hate to say it but its true; communist] attitude that has been threatening our nation from the beginning."
4,a dj's point of view,"the new album from kumbia kings, ""fuego"" is a really great album. it features hits like ""na na na dulce niña, feat belinda"", ""parte de mi corazon with sin bandera"" and of course ""fuego"" wich is a good, cumbia-high energy type tracki personally like this album, exept the track ""bla bla bla"", were a.b and cruz, are dissin the k-1 group(im a big k-1 fan). but thats cool. the album also has great ballad songs wich you can just kick back and listen to. if your a spanish music dj, i highly recommend this album. ""fuego"" is a great crowd getter, so buy this album today, you wont regret it. Dj Steve"
5,PACKING FOR ARGENTINA,"This recording of contemporary Guitar music of Argentina is played magnificently by Victor Villadangos. After listening to this splendid recording, I had fantasies of sitting in a café in Buenos Aires drinking strong coffee. Some of my favorites compositions on the album that I particularly loved are Hector Ayala 7 part ""Serie Americana"" Narsico Saul's ""Boulevard San Jorge"" Maximo Pujol's 5 part ""Suite #1', and Carlos Guastino's ""Sonata No.1"" .All in all, I loved this recording; it certainly put me in the mood to go to Argentina."
5,Great Glass!,"Sightron, in general, are the best bang for the buck if you stick to the SIII's. I would compare these to virtually any non-Swarovski binocs out there in the 8x24 category..."
5,Voice over IP Fundamentals,"Jim, Jon, and Brian have written a good informational book about the basics of voip technology. It is interesting to see where voice started and provide a clear path for where it is going. I found the configurations in the back very useful.As a note to the previous reviewer: Page 168 states that ""serialization delay is not covered IN-DEPTH"". If the previous reviewer continued to read the book they would have noted on page 213 and 214 a discussion on propagation delay and the need for fragmentation. Overall I found the book useful, however I would have liked more configurations."
1,"A good book, but difficult to understand","This is a good book, but not by my standards. After reading I still did not understand some abstract concepts, I have to find some other books to clarify the confusion. It seems to me it was written for those people who already know the subjects quite well."
5,Awesome Coat,"I don't work outside or hunt often, and I was really just looking for a coat to wear when shoveling snow, going to football games, etc. I'm don't really like the look of the tan Carhartt stuff, but this jacket looked a little more nondescript. It is insanely warm, looks good, and feels really well put together. It is pretty stiff, but the inside is really comfortable."
5,Amazing,"Warm rugged well-made, its a great product perfect for real cold climates, deflects wind and snow with ease, its a strong jacket its a bit hard at first but it loosens up after a while. overall im very pleased with the product. i will definitely buy more carhartt products in the future"
3,"It really works, but...","I just started using the Plantskydd deer repellent this year--BEFORE all my plants got eating again, thank goodness. It works like a charm, and there has been no need to re-apply it in the 2 months I've been using it. The problem I have is that the spray nozzle gets clogged very easily, and all you get is big globs of the stuff. Even after thoroughly washing the spray mechanism, it will only spray once or twice before it clogs again. Not much good if you can't actually apply it to your plants!"
5,Must see film...especially now,"At a time when the country stands at a crossroads, the more informationwe have, the better. When I watched this movie, I took notes with the hopesof doing a piece about it as a freelance writer. Editors thought the story had been sufficiently told. Ironically, I pitched it the week that CIA tapes mysteriously disappeared. One of the quotes from the movie is""Freedom is knowledge."" If we don't educate ourselves aboutwhat is happening in our country, we are doomed. Luckily, we have courageous documentary film makers that are willing to put themselves on the line tomake sure that the rest of us know what is going on."
1,A Joke!,"I suspect that ""A Customer"" was also ""The Author."" No one else could have given this ""book"" a positive review. Written by a unqualified, psychotic parent (who subsequently deliberately destroyed the child in the ""story""), this ""book"" was a waste of paper."
1,INCREDIBLE,"Disillusionment to the extreme, Credibility dubious. This selfish martyrdom-complexed person amazingly has pulled in three women into his world, an egomaniacal spiraling out of control place, I feel sorry for the kids. Not to mention, a total control trip for him because his life is out of it, and adulterously sinful per the apostle Paul and Jesus."
1,Dynamic Shame,"Dynamic family life? LOL, his family wised up and left his butt.This ""man"" (only in the biological sense) is deeply disturbed, but mostly just filled with too much pride to do what really is right. Buy the book if you want to see the perspective of an arrogant, selfish, controlling, coward. These are of course the external attributes to cover up for his extreme insecurity and deeply misguided assumptions about marriage and life."
3,A book on dysfunction - NOT a book on poly.,"I agree with the previous reviews in that it is a chronicalof life born into hellish dysfunction and the long hardroad ""up and out"".The multiple partner, or polygamy, aspect of their life isreally a very small side note in the overall theme of the book.If you are looking for a book about overcoming hardship andfinding God, then get this book.If you are looking for insights into building a working multi-partner marriage, then I'd look to ""Love Without Limits"" orsome other poly relationship books."
5,beautiful prayers,"This is a beautiful book of prayers and meditations to be read in the morning and evening. It is touched by Christianity, but focuses on finding God in all creation. I am glad I purchased it."
2,A study of one sided love.,"I don't know how this could be a love story. Maybe my idea of love is old fashioned but definately must include, trust, understanding and a strong affection and personal attachment. The woman in the story was self-indulgent and completely selfish. Most of the other reviews give you the narrative of the story. A woman wanting to escape her family, and a man trying to drown his sorrow accepts a proposal of a non-personal marriage from the woman. His heart turns to love, but her heart turns inward toward her self. Self is her only primal force, from beginning to end. It was a waste of my time. It you want to see debauchery 90% of the time, then it's okay. I wasn't offended, just bored."
1,YUCK,"I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers about the smell of this cleaner...it almost made me lose my lunch. Disgusting, UGH. I suggest anyone who cannot stand this smell to use the Bissell formulations, either the Wood Floor Solutions or Hard Floor Solutions. They have a pleasant, fresh, clean scent."
4,"Fun toy, great for indoors in the winter","This is a fun toy for running around indoors. It's a bit tricky on our floors, going from wood floor to carpet, it gets stuck a lot. But if you have some open space it works pretty well."
4,good deal,"product was price good, was a holiday gift, sister loved it and collects them all, came in no time, no problem when received"
4,One of the better books on this subject,"This is one of the better books on this topic. They prefer that you see an allergy specialist rather than a GP.""The incidence of food allergy is much higher for children than for adjutls - 8 percent of those under three, and rising."" The author claims that adults have outgrown food allergies which lowers it to 2% for the general population. The best part of the book was where he told parents if other people don't consider you ""neurotic"" then you are not being vigilant enough protecting your allergic child. The only ""fault"" the book may have is there is nothing offered as a reasonable cause for the epidemic of food allergies. Science can now look at live blood, we have so much research that has been done, but no one really knows what causes food allergies? Why is it that undeveloped countries have almost no food allergies?"
5,Great CD for a great price!,I really like the fact that I found this CD and was made even better when i saw the price. The delivery time was awsome and I am very happy with my product.
5,Great Series,Love most of what Nora Roberts writes. I especially enjoy her series writing. You can end one and the next starts right where it should be. Great love story as usual. Would recommend series for sure.
5,Excellent story....,The MacKade brothers are 4 books in a series and they are excellent. Loved the relationship that the brothers shared and the romances for each of them were wondefully written. Humourous touches of sibling rivalry.
3,"Anti-music, post-music noise","If you're a fan of noise-rock you'll dig this EP. The first five minutes is just feedback noise, then they break into a couple of ""songs"" to finish out the record. It's actually pretty good stuff. It's alternative let me tell you, it would sound great on an alternative public radio station."
1,Junk bag,"My best friend bought one of these and it fell apart after 3 domestic trips. It's junk, very poorly made, with no attention to detail or longevity. Buyer beware."
5,One of my favorite anime series!,I love all thee Full metal panic series! Full metal panic! full metal panic? fumoffu and Full metal panic! the second raid. The second raid was the series with the most action i highly recommend starting from the beginning this series is hilarious and one of the best i've seen I fully enjoyed every episode.. i'm hoping there will be another FMP this series is on the top of my list! This show is hillarious and action packed! a great adventure series with an sub-story line about love.
5,Storytelling Improved,"If you had a problem or just never cared for the comedy in the first two series then this series makes up for that with a more serious look at the fact that Kaname is in real danger and that is the reason Sousuke is there to protect her. Also reminds us that Sousuke is a human being who does care just doesn't know how to show it most of the time.This release comes with some nice extras. The best being ""A Relatively Leisurely Day in the Life of a Fleet Captain"" OVA which has everything a fan could want, some fan service, everyone's favorite captain, and a closet otaku. Among the rest of the extras are location shooting/interviews while in Hong Kong.This is only brought down by the fact that it could have and maybe should have been longer. Also leaves you wanting much more at the end, this worries me because its been 5 years and no news of another season has surfaced. Always keep hope though."
1,Poorly mastered,"On my blu-ray player the DVD doesn't play properly. There is only the sound, but no picture. On my DVD player the image is shrunk. There are black bars all around the image.(At least it seems to play properly on my PC.)Also, the useless intros and trailers can't be skipped.It is really a shame to ruin such a great anime by such a pathetic DVD."
4,A very very good anime,"Great action, mature and sometimes very funny.I was thinking blu-ray could have been an international product.But no.Instead of that, we see a lot of multiple blu-ray all over the planet.And finally, the best animes on Earth will be only region A.I'm in rage.They always plain of piracy but it's normal they take customers for sheeps and give us products with plenty of defaults.Laughable products and laughable industry."
5,"Comedy, Action, Suspense, and Romance all in one!","I have loved all three seasons of FMP, and even if this one seemed a little out of place in comparison to the first season, it still drove me to watch every episode in one day. You meet all of the characters that we were introduced to once again, and we become exposed to some new characters who I must say show what they can do quite well. ;) The second season is practically ignored, yet Fumoffu can be interperated anywhere chronologically, as just great entertainment. Anyways I was pleased with TSR, the action animation was beautifull, and it was a nice finishing touch to my FMP collection."
2,missing something,"I love Buffy and was really excited about this soundtrack coming out except it didnt have a lot of songs on it that were used in the actual plots. It had a lot of music you dont really remember v/c it was on in the background in the Bronze. I really wish they would have added that great Heather Nova song from Touched, the Bush song from Dead Things, and the awesome Michelle Branch song in Tabula Rasa."
5,Well Pleased,"This album for me is a huge exitement. Most of the tracks are played in the bronze (the club for buffy) wich was a small let down but this soundtrack is the best ever. I dont think i could have wished for a better soundtrack and the best part is that it has the score (The final fight) from ""chosen"". Although ""the breeders"" version of the theme tune is apsalout pants the album would be worth having just because of the score from ""chosen"". No Buffy Album would be worth having without the ""Nurf Herder"" theme on it but this one would be even without it. If you want to buy the Album i would advise for you to get the British version because of the lack of tracks on the US one."
2,Incomplete!,"I was very disappointed that Michelle Branch's Bronze version of ""Goodbye to You"" and Melanie Doane's ""I Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" were not included. IMO, skip it."
2,what's missing,"ok, this cd is, i suppose, fairly okay in its own right; some of the songs are pretty good, like ""ballad for dead friends"" and ""prayer of saint francis""; but what i am wondering is when are they gonna come out with a cd with all the REALLY GOOD music from this show??? There's so much stuff from the fifth, sixth and seventh seasons that's completely passed over (like the song that plays during 'touched' and the one that plays at the end of 'entropy'...)"
4,which one to buy?,"the US version has fewer songs but includes two great ones that are left out of the import version - while that one has nine different songs that make it a more fulfilling package. I'm sure they do this on purpose to drive some diehard fans into buying both. I strongly suggest MP3 and downloading but if that's not an option - go for the import. However, this CD does stand alone as a worthwhile purchase as it includes some great tunes from all of the seasons and you don't have to be a fan to appreciate good music."
4,salt and pepper,I really like this set. The only problem is one shaker has a plug that does not fit properly. It doesn't fit snug in the bottom and falls out.
3,Yawn....,"Some good quotes, some from sources I was not able to find even on Google. No real theme or thread to the flow. And the introductions will put you to sleep. Index was well done, but if the content is lacking no amount of good indexing will help it."
5,Padilla Affair,"A great book of poetry that perforates the fake texture of Cuba's opressive system. Padilla dedicated one of the poems from this book to Yanis Ritzos, the Greek poet that was jailed because of his leftist stand. In contrast, Padilla was later arrested for his criticism of an imperfect revolution which he hoped to improve. This is a crucial book in the inmortalization of history and its mistakes which if forgotten or ignored..are bound to repeat again."
3,Not her best,"I love Eva Ibbotson's books, so I was delighted to find this in the library. However, despite the fact that it is as beautifully written as ever, the story didn't hold my attention as long as others, and I didn't like the way Harriet totally dropped ballet at the end, after working so hard to be a dancer."
2,Not what expected,I ordered this gift basket for my friend for her birthday. I was disappointed it was not what I expected to be. The gift set looks different and ugly.
5,Wake Up America,Too bad our beloved public school system fails us and does not teach history. This book will give you what our school system left out!
3,Did not get the book transferred to my Android. Lost it in the process!,I lost the book in the process of transferring it to my Adroid from my Ipad. So I never read one page of the Book The Committee of 300.Dick Bullock
2,VEry thorough.,This autobiography has seemingly included every detail of the author's life with the tribes of the New Hebrides. It may not have been necessary to include an account of each incident when one would have done to represent all of that particular type. Thus the book is more one of a historical account than one that would inspire others to follow in John's foosteps of ministry.
5,Great alternative if you can't secure your notebook lock on your desk,"I've sold this product on many occasions when installing theKensington 64068F MicroSaver Notebook Lock and Security Cable (PC/Mac)and I couldn't figure out a method of wrapping it through gromets or around something unmovable.This comes with a small tube of superglue, and I will affix it on the underside or backside of the desk.Remember, this is part of the deterrent of the notebook lock, not a perfect security device.I highly recommend it!"
5,I thought the CD was great!,This CD encapsulates raw punk rock energy to the core. Local bands rocking it out!! I love of this!!! Everyone should have it to play in their CD players and car stereos. Very very good. Keep the rocking!
5,The Dells Are Great!,"I love the Dells. They're great soulful R & B singers with a touch of the gospel infused in their singing. Their songs always sound like they're coming from deep in their soul. I just love...love...love them. I can't say it enough. Every song that they sing is beautiful and touches the heart. I love Stay in My Corner, I Miss You, My Pretending Days Are Over, Always Together...well to tell the truth I like all of their songs."
1,inaccurate at best,"I have to agree with David Turner on this one. I too had to read this book and others for an American Popular Music course at Iowa. I found the book boring, inaccurate and when I contacted one of the people quoted in the book, he told me he never made the comments that the book claims he did. He then suggested to me that he was thinking about writing his own book because of the errors in reporting that he has heard over the years. If you are thinking of getting this book, just know that it is based on other peoples ""opinions"" and not much fact."
3,Rockin' Roll book,This book is pretty wordy. It is full of the history at the time and the music/performers but takes too long to get to the point.
3,Not at all what I thought I was buying!,"When they said Little Book they meant it. It's one of those tiny little books you see in the checkout lines of major bookstores. The content was mostly about how to eat! and not about thank you notes, and teaching the basics of etiquette. For 5 bucks and free shipping it's not worth bothering with sending it back for a refund.I will not go and try to find another book to fill my needs. It was to be a gift, but this is way above an 11 year old girls ""station"" in life...it's more for like high society gals! Still good info to know, but doubt I'll ever need to know how to eat a lobster correctly, as I won't eat one anyway!"
5,The Little Book of Etiquette,"This little book is all you need to put yourself in spotlight as an elite socialite. The book is small but chocked full of helpful/useful information. Regardless of the type of event you have been invited to, this book will help you to succeed. It is so small you can slip it into your purse. Everyone should have a copy of this book."
2,More Bad Than Good,"The good: This is very good looking luggage. It has lots of pockets and holds more than you'd expect. The 360 degree rolling feature is very nice.The bad: After one trip out and back, there's a hole in the front pocket and one of the zipper pulls is broken off. The manufacturer says they are not responsible for ""improper handling or damage caused by a common carrier"" and the carrier, of course, doesn't care about my damaged luggage. So now I'm stuck with a brand new, very expensive piece of broken luggage. The 5-piece set that I got for $50 hasn't suffered this kind of damage after 6 years of use. I thought that more expensive luggage meant it would be more durable but it doesn't. You're just paying for the SwissGear name. Please don't waste your money on this luggage!"
5,Great Quality,Had no problems with the luggage. Quality is expected to be high and it was. The only thing to consider is that some airlines will not accept this size for carry on. Going through bag check really does some damage to the fine pewter finish. Just something to think about.
1,Inaccurate Listing,I received a confirmation then an e-mail initiating a refund because the book was out of stock. That's ok but why is the seller still on the list indicating the book is available?
4,This stuff works,"My wife and I both use this product and believe it is as effective as many of the drugs commonly prescribed as muscle relaxants and pain killers, but without the side effects."
4,Strange tasting burp,"I bought this supplement to try out in hopes of improving my overall health and maintaining overall healthiness.I have felt better since taking this supplement, but unfortunately I also started taking other supplement at the same time so cannot be entirely sure that the positive effect can be attributed to this particular effect.A strange effect to this supplement is that I get weird tasting burp. So if you get this don't be alarmed."
3,The New CCR,"This album is my first one from CCR. They have very much a classic southern rock sound and are obviously very competent musicians. Fans of that genre should be very interested in CCR. I like that they slow it down on several tracks and that the vocals are very clear in the mix. They are not just a few guys wailing away on electric guitars.The songwriting is average and most of the songs cover very familiar territory(sex, drugs, rock-n-roll,etc). My favorites are ""Lonely Girl"", ""Cold Hearted Woman"", ""Sick And Tired"" and ""Leave Me Alone"".Overall a good record that fans of classic southern rock should definitely check out."
5,BANZAI!,I bought this for my nephew for Christmas and he loved it. it fits comfortably and fit his head nicely.
5,excelent,the product is very good for the entertainment of babies as well as to develop their first skillsmy baby is very comfortable
5,very handy,"very helpful, especially when you are at home, alone with the baby and you want to keep the baby securely strapped an entertained while you do other chores"
2,Bouncer,"I would not reccommend this bouncer. The back of the bouncer is actually tilted towards the right side as you are facing it. The toy bar keeps dying almost every two weeks. I continually replace the batteries but it does no good. Fisher Price has sent me two replacement toy bars since July, and none of them have worked for longer than two weeks, even replacing the batteries doesn't help. It still keeps dying."
4,Great seat for baby!,"We've had this for a few months now, and it's still one of the ""go-to"" items in our house. Our daughter enjoys the lights and music and is challenged to reach the dangling toys with her hands. She also loves to prop her feet up on the bar;) The only minor gripe I have is that you cannot lower the volume of music and have it stay that way - if the music stops, then when it starts again, it pops right back up to regular volume. However, that is a *very* minor gripe, since the music is not too terribly loud in the first place. Highly recommended!!"
1,He loves it but....,"Like many other reviewers our child loves the chair but, after about a week the gears of the Frog slip and begin making a loud clicking noise. We took the sound and light bar back and exchanged it for another that broke in only two days. On the new one, the music will not stay off after a few minutes it turns back on and wakes him up.I'd like to see Fisher Price add a strap to the underside of the seat to eliminate the rattle of the vibration box as they did on earlier seat as well. All in all this is great idea poorly designed and poorly executed. Fisher Price should replace it."
1,Careful!,I had this collapse with my 6-wk old baby in it due to the faulty/flimsy plastic pieces that hold the metal frame together. I assembled it according to the instructions exactly. It looks like the weak threads that hold the screws in on those plastic pieces are the only thing that are supposed to hold your baby up. Would NOT recommend this!
2,Not for a baby with acid reflux,"This is a very cute bouncer chair. However, I feel it was poorly designed. It sets the baby almost laying down so it is difficult to play with the toys. In addition, our baby has acid reflux and it was not a good chair for him because it sets him back too far. We had to find one that set more upright."
5,Great bouncer!,My baby loved sitting in this bouncer from birth on. It would keep her entertained whilst i got my own work done! She loved watching the little monkey and frog popping in and out and as she got older loved reaching out and playing with the hanging toys. I never used the vibrate function and she didn't care. She still loves it although she has now outgrown her bouncer (9 months) and sometimes when i need to keep her in one place i still strap her in it!
3,L. Hairgrove,"I bought this bouncer as a marked down item at Babies R Us. It did not come in a box so I assumed it was a display because it had no wear or tear to it. It seemed to work fine at the store but when I got it home the animated frog started the horrible clicking/popping noise and getting stuck. I was going to exchange it today, but after reading the reviews here and at Babies R Us I may buy a different bouncer now. It would be a really great bouncer if not for this defect!"
4,Good for the Early months of an infant.,"we used it some but we used the swing far more to help our baby sleep or relax. you can live without this product though. after our baby was able to wiggle out of it, about six months of age, we stop using it."
4,Mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this bouncer. It is cute, the toy bar has nice toys on it and the lights and sounds are nice too. The music isn't annoying at all. My baby is now 11 weeks old, he is an average size baby. When he was first born I would carry this bouncer to whatever room of the house I was in and he would sleep comfortably in it. Now that he is getting older and more alert he is getting interested in grabbing the toys on the toy bar, however, the height of the bar is challenging for him to reach. So recently he has been getting frustrated with this toy. And he doesn't want to stay in it long at all."
2,Low Manufacturing quality control,This product looks difffent than in the picture. It has a missing hole for screw and a part is wrong ensambled.It looks cheap.
4,Baby flips forward if swing is pushed,"I love this product and my 2-week old baby enjoys it and almost always falls asleep when he is in it. The only problem I have had with this swing is the following: I have two more children at home, one is 3 and the other is 1. Yesterday my 3-year old pushed the swing and the baby fell towards the front and was hanging from the swing. Luckily his head did not hit the floor while the swing was moving and most importantly he was buckled up.I know the swing is not supposed to be pushed but this is something that should have been taken into consideration by the manufacturer. If they put some kind of break on the swing so it only goes up to a certain height preventing baby from falling forward.Enjoy your babies and NEVER leave them alone in the swing and DON'T forget to buckle them up.By the way, the swing I have is the modified swing."
3,Section on ethnic facial features is outdated and offensive,"Page 59 in the book refers to the ""five races of man"" not humans, of course, because women are not included in this book's antiquated notion of what it means to be human. It refers to my ethnicity as the ""yellow race, or Mongolian race."" It refers to blacks as Ethiopians, and the red race as American Indian. This belies the book's eugenics-style, antiquated, culturally-insensitive thinking and needs desperately to be revised by someone with a current anthropological background. These terms are not longer used in racial typology and are considered offensive.I'm tempted to return the book for this reason, but because the other content is quite helpful, I'm hoping my review will encourage the publishers to spend the money and time (yes, it's that necessary even though publishing budgets are slimmer and slimmer!), to revise and have the book carefully edited. Lest they only want non-offended buyers of one race to buy the book."
2,I did not like the book,"I guess I expected more from a book. The book lacks pictures, and the recipes weren't that great. Maybe I should write one with my own grandmother's recipes."
5,Heart melting,"This CD was unavailable for a while. Agony. I'd heard the song ""If"" on a radio show and wanted to buy it THAT DAY and couldn't. I wrote Mr. Ford a fan letter and he most graciously wrote back. He thanked me for the kind words and said ""it is my favorite CD of my own work.""""If"" and ""Don't Lose your Faith in Me"" are heart melting and I've listened to them a zillion times; but the rest of the CD is slammin'. I can't imagine my life without this music, it's so great. Robben Ford is rightly considered one of the greatest guitarists of this time. But I love the way he sings too. Simple and true."
4,In a Steely Dan mood...,"The amazing Robben Ford returns with a collection of great new songs reminiscent of the seventies.Combining R&B,jazz,and blues, Ford managed to create an excellent package that-consciously or not-pays tribute to the seventies era while remaining thoroughly grounded in the present."
2,The Remote Stopped Working after Two Weeks,"The remote was always confusing, I pushed that button 40 bajillion times in all manner of combinations. Finally the remote just stopped working. I sent the whole thing back.Nice idea, poor execution."
2,did not work,"It is a nice looking lamp, however it did not work as it was susposed to.I even returned the item and requested for another one, but that also did not function.Apparently once a second bulb is put in the unit then the lamp begins to flicker, and eventualy stop working all together.Now in all fairness this could have been just a bad batch and all the others are just fine.Well atleast I hope so anyway."
2,OK lamp. Touch controls.,"Controls are touchy on this. Remote sends a single signal and you have to double tap, single tap...do odd things to make it brighter, dimmer, and turn off. There is a very slight humming noise, but barley noticable."
3,Not the best tape,"I think the music on this tape is creative and good, but it is somewhat slow. I probably would not have purchased this tape if I had heard it first. However, I am looking forward to trying their other recordings."
2,Say what?,Not a good recording as compared to those songs I heard on Bill Stewart's radio show many years a go.
4,Storytelling,"Singing stories that are joyous, sad and oft bittersweet, Slaid Cleaves makes yet another solid folk album in his ""Wishbones."" He takes on the voice of many in a solid slice of Americana, be it the fallen jockey in ""Quick as Dreams"" or the old neighbor on concert favorite ""Horses and Divorces"" and makes them all a great listen.It is the outcasts in life that make for the most interesting songs here. ""Tiger Tom Dixon's Blues"" are the woes of a fighter who is seeing his prime move into his past. The families displaced by rising waters behind a dam in ""Below."" The immigrant heartbreak of ""Borderline."" These are real people that you feel you know, and Slaid breathes them to life. And if these seem too far from your experiences, he will take you downtown to your bar for ""Drinking Days."" If your view of Honky Tonk includes the likes of Lucinda Williams or Joe Ely, ""Wishbones"" and Slaid'sBroke DownorUnsungwill fill your jukebox."
1,Falls far short of artist's standard,"Cleaves is in the best of times an inconsistent composer, capable of indifferent songs as much as inspired ones. On both Unsung and Broke Down, however, he offered at least five excellent songs each. Whatever mix of musical invention and lyrical flair served him on those albums has deserted him here. His complaint of life on the road sounds callow and unearned (song #2), his ballads mawkish, oh-so-sensitive and/or boring (5, 7 and particularly 10) , his humor uninfectious (#8), his turns of phrase generally unconvincing. Only song #4 is a success. Sure glad I didn't hear this album first, or I'd not have bothered with his quite good others."
4,Medium is quite big,"I am about a 33/34. I bought a medium but it was way too big for me. Most dancers will wear a small. Its a cute garment though. I am looking forward to seeing the small I ordered.Update:I liked the small so much I ordered four. I wear them a great deal under sweaters for extra warmth and as a light, easy to wear pull-on indoors. I love the extra long sleeve. Of course they are perfect for any type of exercise. Since international travel has inflicted two consecutive winters on me, mine have seen very heavy wear. They have worn well. The ends of the sleeves tend to develop a flare if - like me - you like to push them up your arm, but I rather like that."
3,Durability lacking!,"My 3 year old got this for Christmas. He was playing with it on the carpet making the little man simulate picking up garbage when the little man's foot broke a hole right in the top of the truck. He wasn't being rough at all. The truck still works, but this product is a far cry from the Tonka trucks I remember."
3,"Great truck, but it broke!",My 2.5 yr old LOVES this truck. He takes it back and forth from home to Grandma's house. The lame thing is that after just a couple weeks the piece that holds the garbage can onto the belt broke. I was able to fix it once but it fell off again. The little rod that holds the belt together is a bit scary since we also have a 11 mos. old crawling around. I had to hide the garbage can from my 2.5 yr old so he isn't reminded that his truck has broken. Definitely his favorite truck even if it is broken.
5,A beautiful aviation book!,"This beautiful book is rich with details about Lloyd Stearman and his airplanes, but also has many unexpected insights into aviation of the era. Who knew, for example, that WWI preparation in the U.S. included buying 350,000 Nuchwang dog skins from China to make flying suits? Ed Phillips is a wonderful author and this book is one of his best!"
1,"worst radiation book ever, attix does a MUCH better job!","worst radiation book ever, attix does a MUCH better job!author does not explain anything. material which should have been covered in 40 pages is condensed to 5-8 pages in each chapter...don't buy unless you can't survive your class without this book."
3,review wallstickers,"cute stickers but seller had same on sale with different name, picture and price which was not nice for customer"
1,Terrible! Won't stick to our walls at all,"I have tried to put these on our wall in our new nursery only to find out they won't stick to our wall at all. My husband jokingly said, ""use the glue stick"". Even with that I doubt they will stick. The ones I bought for 1.99 stuck much better. Do not buy these Horrible stickers unless you want to be just as frustrated as I am."
5,Great Glasses!,These were exactly what I was looking for! Work great for me!!!Actually thinking about buying another pair now as a back up!
5,Great Bible Challenge,"The Bible Challenge on DVD is great for entertainig guest of all ages. After dinner we divide up into teams and play, everyone is learning and having fun. This game makes a great gift for all occasion."
5,highly recommendable,"This book is informative, useful and convenient because it mentions all the important tips and tricks for a job seeker. It is easy and quick to read. It also explains you how and guides you through to prepare for an interview as well as how to behave during the interview to get the job offered to you. It is a must-to-read book, in my opinion."
3,"Good, but a bit overhyped","I ordered this book because of all the glowing reviews. Next time I will go by the flip test.Ms. Jones is certainly a credible, if inconsistent, author. Her Book of Words stuff was wonderful, though I've been put to sleep by other works. Cavern of Black Ice certainly has strengths, but I didn't really find characterization to be one of them. She sometimes falls into the Goodkind trap as well, endeavoring to make everything so intense that it sags into melodrama.This is a good book. I don't think it is a great book, but it is worth a read. I wouldn't buy in hardcover, however, unless you like the cover art."
5,Can anyone tell me...?,"What has happened to the sequel ""A Fortress of Gray Ice?"" There was a lot of hoopla that the book was coming out, then suddenly nothing. Has the book been delayed? Did it get rejected? Did Ms. Jones die? Can anyone tell me? Thanks!"
1,Generic book that is boring and poorly written.,"This book is extremely unoriginal, its characters are paper thin with no depth, and it is written very badly. I tried hard to finish this book, but i just couldn't stomach it after 300 pages, to the fire with this book."
2,Half the book is backstory,"I just read this .... and I had to skip or skim at least 1/4 to 1/3 of the book. Too much information, as if the author just had to include all her backstory. Many sentences go on and on with descriptor after descriptor, comma after comma. I think a good editor would have worked this book into a decent 350 pages and I believe it would have been a better book with less. Throughout the read I kept thinking that the author would be greatly assisted by reading, or re-reading, Hemingway, who could say so much in 2 pages.That aside, I give the book 2 stars because some (not all) of the characterizations are outstanding.I tried to read the second book immediately, but 5 pages in and I was exhausted. I doubt I will finish the series."
3,racehorse behind a plow,"Brent has it all. A tremendous voice and charisma that could put a spin on any tune. In short, Broadway brilliance. Unfortunately, this collection holds him back at nearly every turn. Chicago never sounded so dull. Wet from Steel Pier is tres, tres polite--no thanks. Even when he is allowed to turn it on, this recording buries him under the orchestration (why mix it like he's 75 with a failing voice that needs to be camouflaged?) Why not showcase a true star? It's like putting the Mona Lisa on display behind thick shower glass. Misguided. Only a few songs let you see what this album could have been: Isn't this Better; Why Should I Wake Up (duet); Married; The Skin of our Teeth. Take the best and put it in a compilation. Regret the rest."
2,the orchestrations are dragging it down,"I love the music of Kander and Ebb, and I really enjoy Brent Barrett as a performer. However many of the orchestrations on this album, most memorably All That Jazz, really drag this recording down."
1,Product too strong,"This product caused heart palpatations, dizziness and lightheadedness. After 3 weeks on it, I had to discontinue use."
2,Made in China,I thought all Lisle items were produced in the USA until I received this scribe. It's made in China. I wish all items sold on Amazon that are produced in the USA would be marked as such.
1,Not spicy!,"Was this supposed to be hot? We've tried all the settings on this adjustable heat spray, and I can tell you for certain that this is NOT SPICY. The flavor of the spray is not bad, but definitely not hot."
1,wack wack!!,man this movie isnt worth even watching for free! i didnt even buy it but instead watched one of my homegirl's copy and was still upset. i agree with the first reviewer completely it is enough of these low budget movies with notable actors with bad script writing. come on master p at least foolish was a real movie with at least a desent plot. cmon katt this is really bad i mean he aint even that funny in here! the only thing good in the movie are those two bad brauds that work for master p and that chick that works at the sub store.
1,Less ego and more Photoshop,I did not find this book to be user friendly. The author waste time and print taking about things that has nothing to do with photoshop. Likes to blow his own horn a lot and does not explain why he does thing.There are a lot of better books on photoshop than this one.
1,Good ideas poorly told,"This book could be the definitive Photoshop color correction guide, but it's not. The author establishes clear familiarity with the intricacies of the topic, but his bloated misdirecting writing style assures confusion for the reader. A master teacher makes a complicated topic seem simple. This is where the author fails, for me. He cannot get out of his own way in the telling. I wished he presented his topic with laser focus and avoided competing opinions (which he foolishly introduces himself). By analogy, if this were a book about carpentry and you wished to know the best type of hammer to buy, the author would give you the history of hammers starting with the rock and ending with the pile driver. You would finish the book and still not know the best hammer to buy.The color correction ideas in this book are good, but be prepared for frustration and anger as you try to comprehend the text."
3,Too much sarcasm and babbling.....,"Though I appreciate the technical aspect and techniques offered by the author, I found his sarcasm and babbling very annoying and distracting. This book could be trimmed down to half its size if the author would just cut the babbling and get to the actual techniques that he has to offer.Perhaps if you're the kind of reader that actually want to sit long hours over a cup of coffee and learn color correction than this book is for you. If you're like me, just wanting to get straight to the point because you're a busy person or what not, than look elsewhere. Because unless you have the time and patience to read through jokes and sly remarks, this book will irritate you.Good techniques, unnecessarily long presentation, in my opinion."
2,A book for graduate math students,"""Set Topology"" is a book that bridges between books that only other PHD's read and ones that an engineer just interested in modern topology can read. I wouldn't tell a first time student to read it, but it is written so that if you have a background in topology, you can follow things like Holder's inequality. It has a useful section on convergence topology that applies to much of the applications of modern topology. I frankly wish I hadn't spent the money on it!"
1,don't buy it,"Bought 8 coil pack and found 4 of 8 defective. MSD has not been able to replace defective units for last 5 months citing manufacturing problems. Don't waste your $, there is no refund policy from MSD."
3,"Not an improvement of ""BONAMPAK"" But...","If you can't find ""BONAMPAK"" which was the original issue, then this might satisfy you. They took ""BONAMPAK"" and re-processed the numbers adding electronic ""enhancements"". But if you were to hear both CDs side by side you can tell that ""Ring..."" sounds weaker as if the main melody was pushed just slightly to the background. This CD does have a certain magic of its own and like ""BONAMPAK"" it is best heard on a good audio system with as large speakers as you can get and turned up. When you hear it like that the music transports you to different mental levels. But it is by no means Aztec or Incan music. It is just idealized. And there's lot of barking dogs in the jungle!"
3,Inexpensive but slow,"A bargain for what I use it for --- namely to carry around important info in a small package. However, I was dissapointed in the speed --- it takes a long time to write to it.The little manual that comes with it has multiple errors in it --- looks like someone was not terribly familiar with English."
2,Stainless Steel Mixing Bowls,"Unfortunately, after one use, the second to smallest of the bowls started coming apart around the rim. I had used it to beat some whipping cream, and expected it to be far more user friendly. Other than that, I am happy with the set so far."
2,12 Stones Going A Bit Too Mainstream,"I won't lie to Paul McCoy, as I do like some of the songs on Anthem for the Underdog, specifically ""Lie to Me"" (the acoustic version) and ""Adrenaline"" which recalls the enthusiasm of the last song on their first album, ""Sick and Tired"". I even like the new direction toward ballads. However, I can't help but notice that he has unnaturally altered his voice to sound more like the lead singer from Nickelback. I'm not a Nickelback hater. I'm not even against one band showing influences from another. All I am saying is that the influence of one particular band should not be so obvious. The uniqueness and the edginess that was in the previous two albums is just missing. Next time, maybe they will do better."
3,Mediocre album,"I thought the first two releases from 12 Stones were very unique and original albums that brought something new and different to my CD collection. When this album came out, I bought it the day it was released. It unfortunately seems as though 12 Stones would rather put out a generic rock album like so many other run of the mill bands that have become mainstream than stick to the type of music that made their first two albums so original. While this album is not bad, if this was a new band's debut, I would not have given the album a second listen due to the mediocrity. Because of the enjoyment I got out of their first two albums, I'm sure this one will stick around in the collection for a while, but won't see anywhere near the play as their previous efforts."
5,The Polished Direction,"After the filthy riffs permeating the outstanding Potter's Field, it seemed like it was time to clean up 12 Stones' sound, and that's what happened here: save for ""Games You Play,"" every song here sounds as tight as it can be, whether heavy riffs or slower, emotional electrics are the catalyst. Some bands try the softer route and fail miserably, but that's not the case here. Kudos to 12 Stones."
2,You get what you pay for,Its a basic potty that moves when my 15 month old is trying to sit. It is very light.
2,Seemed to low to the floor for child to sit on,This potty appeared to be well-made but it appeared to be hard for the child to sit down on and her feet seemed to low to the floor.
1,way too small!,"This potty chair is hardly a chair! It is a great idea, perfect price and light weight but...when any normal size child sits on it there is no way it does not spill! The splash guard is so low and the chair is so narrow once the child is on it there is no room for the urine. I would definately not recommend this chair for a boy!!! The larger Bjorn chairs are great, but stay away from this one unless your child is half the size of others their age!"
3,"Great price, super-cute, just really small","I bought this potty after reading the reviews and trying to decide on the little or big potty. I didn't think the small one would be a problem, since my 18-month old son is on the small side. However, after receiving it, I would only recommend this potty to those who are doing EC or for travel. My son seems to like it, but he looks huge on it and it will not last for long. It also slides all over the tile floor like someone mentioned. I really wish I would have bought the Bjorn big potty."
3,babybjorn little potty,i didn't realize how little these were. i have them in both bathrooms for my granddaughter who is 18 mo old. she does use them but does have difficulty getting up afterwards. i am trying to figure out how to prop them up so it will be easier for her. i bought the larger one which is great but i gave it to her parents
4,Baby bjorn potty,"This product was exactly as described. It is perfect for the smaller or younger child. My daughter is a rather short 15 month old & is very interested in sitting on the potty so this is just the right size for her to independently get on & off. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was because it does sometimes slip on our tile floor as my daughter is trying to get on or off. It has no bells or whistles, which is exactly what I wanted. It was shipped promptly."
4,Very convenient.,"This potty chair is very convenient, but VERY small. It is sturdy and easy to clean."
5,Perfect for E.C.,This potty is great for tiny butts! We did part-time Elimination Communication from 3 months on and this potty was perfect for my son's little tush!
4,Worth the Price and time invested.,"If you are new to Texas hold em, a very good set of videos to invest in.Even experienced players will pick up tips that may help win a hand ina crucial spot. Never can have too much info to evaluate your ownplaying style. Would love to see a video of Annie actually playing andexplaining her strategy after the fact."
5,a great tribute to a great band,Anne Clarke doesn't know what she is talking about. This tribute album is a must buy for anyone who is a fan of The White Stripes. The attention to detail that the performers captured is amazing and I could literally sing along with the songs even though there were no vocals. Overall I would fully recomend this to anyone who enjoys The White Stripes. This a wonderful album to listen to and it deserves a spot up on your shelf next you your White Stripes albums.
3,You must appreciate the strings for this.,"Since I am a fan of the White Stripes, I can only feel honored for Meg and Jack that a String Quartet would want to pay tribute to them. I'm buying this because I am such a White Stripes fan, and I enjoy the sounds of string instruments. I also feel this would be a good addition to my White Stripes Collection."
3,Ten oz. French Onion Soup Bowl Review,These bowls are very pretty. But when I opened them I realized that they were not big enough for the amount of soup I wanted and I slice of bread on top. Twelve or sixteen would be better.
3,Too Small,The only negative that I would have is the size of the bowl. It is really small and very difficult to eat a good helping of French Onion soup in. Other than the size it is very nice.
3,Soup Bowl,Not what I expected. But nice for beans etc. Really too small for soup. The supplier was not one I'd ever order anything from again. Hence I only order what Amazon has and ships.
1,Miss labeled MAD BALL in Good Neighbor Sam Package,Here we were all set to watch Good Neighbor Sam this last Saturday evening and low and behold the DVD Labeled Good Neighbor Sam was infact another Jack Lemon black & white movie titled Mad Ball. Be careful when you order.
1,Wrong movie,"I ordered this movie and was very dissapointed when they sent another movie instead called, Operation Madball. Good Neighbor Sam has always been a favorite in my family and we were so looking forward to viewing it and when we turned it on and saw it was different than what I ordered we were really let down. Don't think I will order from this outfit anymore."
1,Didn't work,I purchased this vidio as used like new. this vidio will not play when you put it in the player the screen goes black. I wouldn't tell anyone to buy this dvd.
5,This Funny and Cute Movie Should Be On DVD!,I like Jack Lemmon and of the movies of his that I have seen Good Neighbor Sam is my favorte and I'm very disappointed that this movie hasn't been put on DVD yet. Please put out a widescreen DVD for this very funny and cute movie!
4,Maceo is Overpowered by Funk!,"I am a big fan of Maceo, I like his previous albums more where there is more jazz. This album is almost entirely funk. Lyrics are the same, corny; great music though, I recommend it-- but expect more funk, not jazz."
1,Stolen Merchandise,The DirectTV receiver I purchased still has an unsettled account with past due charges attached to it. I want my money back!
1,Tawanda,It was an old obselete receiver that Direct T.V. said could not be used with my current service no remote as pictured was shipped with the item. I actually got a brand new HD receiver from Direct T.V for only a couple of extra dollars.Would not suggest anybody purchase this junk from this company.After I returned the item I had to file a complaint because they had not applied my refund into my bank account over a week later and I returned it with delivery confirmation.
2,Interesting at first... then sort of goes flat,"I initially picked up this book because I had heard a lot of good things about the author. Unfortunately... I was somewhat disappointed. At first, the characters and the story are fairly interesting, but it quickly deteriorates from there. After the first few chapters, it was hard for me to continue reading because the story and characters no longer held any interest for me. The uninspired writing did nothing to help alleviate any of this. While I did eventually finish this novel, I cannot find anything positive to say about ""The Angel and the Sword""."
3,Not as Good as Many of her Books.,"I was rather disappointed with this book. I just did not find the characters particularly riveting or memorable. This was certainly not up to the standards of Jerusalem or even her first book The Firedrake. Although she gets off to a good start the book begins to drag when they reach Paris and I had a hard time finishing this book, despite the fact it is a rather short book -- more of a novelette than a novel."
4,I love this!!!,It's fantastic because you can go to the internet and get thousands more puzzles!! I down loaded hundred of them for FREE!! But I will be buying some more sets of puzzles in the future. The one drawback is that you can't use your own pics to make puzzles. I had an older software that would allow you to do that.
2,it's ok,It's ok but I didn't like it. There isn't much room to do the puzzle on and the pieces don't look right like a regular puzzle.
2,Not the best,"I was a little disappointed in the Discover Dance Combinations series. You can select to view the men's part or the lady's part or as it is danced as a pair. This complicates the menu system a little for the older generations or those not familiar with complex DVD menu's.The instructional angle means that you must look at the TV over your shoulder and sometimes review the figure (move) a couple of times just to find out how it is performed. The voice over is dull and makes learning this dance from this DVD painful and without the enthusiasm that is needed to enjoy dancing.Rather look at the Librero's ""How to become a good dancer"" series."
4,Interesting and informative,"This book is about an enduring love between the author, who was born in Singapore but who now lives much of the time in England, and her mother. The author cleverly combines a social history of Singapore in the 1950's and 1960's with a story about her own childhood community and its impoverished conditions. She emphasizes the forward thinking by her mother who, despite her own lack of education, poverty and family pressures, fought for her children to have a good education. Many years later, her mother becomes incapacitated by Alzheimer's disease and this decline is well documented by the author. I found this book to be very interesting and despite a few irrelevancies it was well written and informative both about Singaporean life and the problems of the disease."
5,SENIOR ADULTS BECAME KIDS AGAIN,"It is evident to me after reading this book, as a senior citizen who just bought a new bicycle, that the contents of this book are not just for kids. It was extremely helpful to both me and my husband who are SENIOR kids. This book would be a very appropriate purchase for anyone regardless of age who owns or is contemplating buying a bicycle. After reading this book, children of ALL AGES would gain the confidence to maintain and use their bicycle safely. This book should be available at all bicycle shops."
3,There are some solid tracks:,"However, they are plagued by those sound bytes that are recorded at the end of each song. I wish these were recorded on separate tracks 'cause now I'll have to work on editing these out just to keep the song intact. Speaking of which, tracks 10, 11, and 12 are the heavy-hitters on this compilation and makes it worth buying."
5,You could warm your hands by it,"Total agreement with the editorial reviewer. This is a warm and affecting glimpse into the creation of ""real"" music. It has the feel of sitting around the living room with three of the finest acoustic musicians of this or any time."
1,"I've waited years, now I have to wait even longer...","Very excited about the possiblilty of purchasing this childhood favorite, however after reading the reviews of the poor quality (GRAINY?..AND WHAT..NO LETTERBOX???) I will wait until Disney decides not to trash one of their better late 1960's movies. I have come to expect poor quality DVD's from no-frills cheaper ... DVD and VHS titles, however never would have expected Disney to resort to this type of poor quality merchandising. As Mel Brooks' ""Yogurt"" character from Spaceballs said ""Merchandising...where the real money from the movie is made..."" Surely a good quality transfer onto DVD contitutes good merchandising?"
1,Looks are deceiving,"I thought this would be a great purse based on the websites picture, but it turns out its VERY small, and too cheap looking to be PRADA. Definitely not worth the price, I'm very disappointed, and sending this purse back."
3,General Overview,"I've cited several passages in a very detailed book I'm writing on Arnold's march, but only in what Bird gets wrong concerning the maps, scouts and blame for my ancestor Reuben Colburn's boat construction techniques, but it's not as bad as some have said. Once underway Colburn' Company of carpenters is nowhere to be found, when in reality they marched and repaired the bateaux all the way to Quebec and the flat-bottomed boats carried many of the leaders all the way to the French settlements. It has more background on the surrounding campaigns on Lake Champlain and the background of Canada at the time, prior to and during the march, but the march itself is a quickie version, as is the actual battle. My book has been turned down by Oxford and many agents claiming ""I didn't write it for the average reader."" This one was but most of the intersesting details aren't there as they should be."
5,"Entertaining, informative, challenging, revelatory essays.","In Purpose!: The Forgotten Principle, Raymond Wikstrom sounds an overdue and much needed wake-up call to the necessity of elevating public political and social discourse to a new level of integrity as we proceed through a new century. Wikstrom's entertaining, informative, and challenging essays are declarative demands for moral leadership arises from his many years of experience as a leader of sailors and marines in and out of wartime. Purpose!: The Forgotten Principle takes on the vanities of the Conservative Right as embodied in the NRA, Oliver North, and Newt Gringrich, as well as the intellectual and philosophical failings and posturings of the Liberal Left."
1,Beware,"I bought this to move files of all types from a Win98SE desktop to a WinXP media center desktop. I had problems from the get-go. The installation software deleted and changed the drive configs on the Win98SE. Deleted the internal cdrom drive. Changed the regedit,config.sys, and autoexec files and substitued its own. Took 2 full days w/tech support to get computer back to operation. THEN the Sonic software is really screwed up! The CinePlayer sw wouldnt recognize the external Iomega drive and thus would not launch and froze the computer! The Sonic support is terrible at best. A non-toll free phone and missed scheduled appointments lead to Sonic not being able to fix the problem. I ended up returning the Iomega for a full refund. Iomega does NOT support the Sonic software it uses. Don't waste your money with this nor any Sonic software product."
1,don't waste your time,Stop and read this before ordering.I have a brand new Dell with USB 2.0. I wanted an external drive because it is hard to reach the one in my desktop. So I ordered the Iomega.I could do nothing to make the Dell recognize the Iomega. I kept getting unrecognized USB device. And Iomega support was useless. This device goes back into the mail today.I am running Windows XP Pro.
2,common problem...,"The proportions of the sweater were such that I had to return it. The problem is that while the sleeves are amply long and the material is great, the sweater was simply too short at the waist. Sizing up wouldn't solve the problem as the width and sleeves also increase."
2,DOESN'T SERVE ITS ENTIRE PURPOSE,I purchased the adapter for the timer Not so sure the items are truly compatible. The first time I used the adapter it fried the timer. I ordered another one and found out that you can not have batteries in the item as a backup. You have to use one or the other.
2,Snowman gift box,"This item is very cute. HOWEVER, the contents of the box is weak. The box included some candy and cookies. However, the items did not look appealing or worth the money. Although it makes a cute wine gift box, I was a bit embarrassed by what was included in the box (which I did not realize until after I gave out several of these as gifts)."
2,Very disappointed,"I ordered this for my grandchildren and not only was it not in a wrapper so that they couldn't see what it was before christmas, all the contents were broken. I am very disappointed with this product and wouldn't advise anybody to order it."
1,Lasted Two Weeks,"I have had this CD player for two weeks and have used it very little. Yesterday, the headphones shorted out, and the right one only works when you hold the wire a certain way. Maybe I just got a defective one, but I wouldn't recommend taking a chance on it."
2,The Cavemen and cavewomen lost Europe more than we thought!,Since publishing Seven Daughters of Eve it has been discovered (in the summer of 2002) that genetically most europeans are around 30% neolithic syrian and 70% caveman. Sykes thought 20% was the max for neolithic syrian in europeans. Makes sense that europeans often be 30% scrawny Syrian in origin. Most europeans don't seem physically that brawny as they should if the very robust cro-magnon/cave people were so very much the lion's share of their ancient ancestors. The information in Sykes's book has already gotten a little out of date.
1,The thing that bugged me the most about his book,"His treatment of the Polynesians. What are they doing in the book supposed to be on Europeans. I know others have written this on here but it's what I find so bad about it. Also, where is the index?"
1,He's clearly no biologist,"All you really need to know in order to gauge the accuracy of the research in this book is that Sykes, an Oxford professor of genetics, actually accepts (and repeats) as fact the myth about women suspending their menstrual cycles and being unable to ovulate/conceive while breastfeeding. Unbelievable. If I want old wives' tales, I'll go to Snopes.com. He also gets a huge kick out of telling us (at length) how he is distantly related to Tsar Nicholas II. Boring, irrelevant, and arrogant."
1,What stinks the most about this book,"Sykes's boring ego trip for one thing. Next, the entire last seven chapters of the book. Page after page of boring monotonous caveman and cavewoman stories. How dull can you get? Hardly one bit of these stories happened for sure anyway. At least the 100%fictional Flintstones was fun to watch. This book is dullsville and often pointless."
3,"Good begining, weak ending","The first ~200 pages of this book are a clear and interesting description of what mitochondrial DNA can tell us about human ancestry and history. The last ~100 are clunky fiction loosely tied to the science of the first 2/3rd of the book. Sykes writes well about science, but should steer clear of fiction."
3,Inside..Outside,"This book's premise and conclusion is too similar to ""Mapping Human History"" (race is a social construct with no biological basis) for me to like, but it's chapters on basic biology and population genetics are informative for the lay reader.And it was the last couple chapters in ""Mapping Human History"" that were ""we are the world"" (not just the last)."
1,Horrible,"I really regret buying this book. It jumps around, and the way it explains things will make you even more confused. Even all the stuff I already knew, I read and was like what? Gee I'm glad I already know how that works and how to do that, because if I didn't, I would be completely lost."
3,"A nice collection of Industrial/EBM, old and new","Don't think of this 2 CD set as the best of the best of the electronic industrial genre. Rather, think of it as an expansion to your collection that includes some interesting older and harder to find material. It contains a few great club hits by bands such as Leather Strip, Frontline Assembly, Snog, and others. The best and most well known tracks appear on disc 1, but disc 2 holds it's own even if some tracks are obviously weak fillers. There are no doubt better compilations out there of this kind of music, but at least EBM Club Classics Vol. 2 delivers exactly what it promises...true Industrial/EBM music. Just keep in mind that EBM tends to be popier and more quirky than true harsh industrial."
5,Exactley as advertised,Exactley as Advertised. I love collecting these signs and am always looking for more. This sign makes a great addition to my man-cave as my wife calls it.
5,Just as advertised.,Just what I wanted at a good price. Delivered as expected. Looks great on wall in my basement. Glock Perfection.
1,Not good,"I can only say that I feel sorry for Ms. Way if she thinks that a verbally abusive man is, in any way, a romantic figure for the general public. It makes me wonder what type of relationships she has had in the past. They story was 'okay', but I found the man rude and nasty, even if his inner feelings were the opposite. I will not buy any more books by this author."
4,Thank you amazon,I CANT FIND THESE ANYWHERE. The unit itself is good for only small rooms. This little filter DOES get everything in the air though. EVEN SOOT FROM BURNING CANDLES!
4,Clean Air!,"The filter and the system work very well for me. I find the H-B model 04381 a very quiet unit, and it runs 24/7 (on low) in my bedroom. Here is a hint, for those who would like near-HEPA performance: Fabricate & install a charcoal pre-filter when installing a new main filter. You can get these at Sears or other places that sell home air filters & supplies: Honeywell Universal Replacement Pre-filter #38002. Cut a piece to size, tape it to the new filter on the air inlet side. Secure it well all around the edges. I like that new blue masking tape, it works really well and does not dry out (at least when it is not exposed to excessive heat or sunlight).As a bonus, you get an automatic change indicator: When the black charcoal pre-filter turns grey, it is time for a replacement."
3,Nice.,"Ive been looking for this on here for a long long time.Its a messed up movie. Seriously. But its not so much ACTUALLY disgusting stuff. Like if it has someone drinking pee. They dont actually show theguy peeing into the container. Its all out of view. If it was real...yeah...different story.All in all, i think its hilarious.It has some really BAD BAD BAD humor. Like, if your offended by guys pretending to be midgets while in black face...um seriously, dont bother. I would buy this in a heartbeat...if it wasnt $99.I love this film...But $99?I think not my friend. Still im glad its on here.I absolutely want a copy of it. But after actually SEEING and LOVINGthis movie. I STILL cannot justify $99.its WELL BEYOND the epitome of a low budget B-movie.If the seller SERIOUSLY and DRASTICALLY drops the price.I would like to be first in line."
2,Poor Organization,"I decided to buy this book instead of borrowing from the library because of the pretty colorful pictures it has. However, I regret spending $100 on this book because the text is poorly orgnanized. Although some chapters are written well, you will see content are scrambled within some chapters making it hard to take notes. There are also errors like they mentioned that Th cell help cellular response, but they ever tell you how. The activation gate and inactivation gate mentioned in the neuron chapters are confusing. The mentioned it on the text, but they don't show it on the pictures.I need to admit that their animation, tutorial in their web site are awesome.I would recommed the campbell book instead"
3,"the details of biology in ""life"" are descriptive.","the details of biology in ""life"" by purves, are descriptive. the pictures are also descriptive and tell a lot of information needed to process biology."
5,An indispensable book to understand the Constitution,"Without history the Constitution is an incomplete set of norms without a soul. With its history is an epic that give liberty a house to continuosly develop.This book is an indispensable tool to understand the Constitution and its dynamics.A historic contribution.Héctor Luis AcevedoFormer Mayor of San Juan, Puerto RicoProfessor of Law and Political Science"
1,A Nationalist Interpretation of the Constitution,"This author suggests that the states were no longer sovereign once they ratified the constitution. How could one say that upon a careful reading of the ""federalist papers?"" I would suggest careful attention paid to Federalist #28 and #39 in particular."
3,Nice,"The club came in two days earlier than expected, but found that the one I recieved was different than the one pictured. I am not sure if it is a newer version of the one pictured but it is still looks and feels solid for an inexpensive club. Im fairly new to the game and didn't really want to spend a whole lot of money and this club had good reveiws and was cheaper than the prices at most used golf club shops. I will post another review once I get out on the range and put it to use."
2,Less than average.,"I picked up one of these at a local store a year ago and played about 25 rounds with it.It is an okay driver if you compare it to 10-15 year old technology but this driver getsdestroyed by the newer Ping G15 or the TM Burner Superfast, etc. If you really enjoy thegame of golf go ahead and spend the extra $100 or so and get something brand name madefrom 2010 on. I think it gets good reviews because it is pretty easy to hit straight.Pros: Cheap and it generally moves the ball forward and straight when you hit it.Cons: Cheapo paint, cheapo shaft, heavy and the true sweet spot is pretty small."
4,Nice Clubs,"I recently got a new set of left handed clubs for my birthday from my brother (he can afford it). I golf both left handed and right handed but I am better with my left, but before this I didn't have a good left handed driver that I could really belt it out with. Well I don't have took look anymore I went on a trip to north carolina for a week and had a chance to golf a couple of times and this club let me tell you hits very well for such a cheap priced driver. I decided that I want to buy some decent golf shoes now. The only problem I have is that I dont get out as ofen as I would like so its harder to justtify the cost."
4,Good Driver for the Price,"This driver allows me to swing aggressively and still hit the ball straight, but I did notice less distance over my last driver. My other driver was 8.5 degree loft and this one is 10.5 degree so it is only logical for a reduction in distance. But there are times when I need more loft, so this club will still remain in my bag."
4,I really can do this and it is fun.,"I have always wanted to knit but never had the time. Now, after a severe injury that has left me without the ability to participate in the life I used to be a part of I'm involved in knitting for a hobby.This book is excellent. I tried a few others but this one is my favorite."
5,Mom's Gift,"Got this CD for my mom, and she loves it thus far. She has yet to finish it, but likes it thus far."
3,Chech connector carefully,Got an O2 for my 2005 MCS. Sensor comes with anti-seize on threads. Look at inside of AMP connector carefully. The rib pattern inside shroud is diffrent for pre cat.and post cat. use. There should be diffrent part number for pre cat. and post cat.use. Supplied O2 sensor has taller top but it fits.in post cat. location.Used craft knife to remove ribs and everything works fine now.Part came on time as originally quoted. All is good now.
1,Not Good for 2003 MINI Cooper R50,"SES light would still go on and off with this Bosch replacement in a 2003 MINI Cooper R50. I have also confirmed that it is due to the sensor, and not an exhaust leak or other issues that may lead to a pre-cat O2 sensor code being thrown. Although Bosch is usually a safe aftermarket choice, if you own a MINI Cooper, I recommend going with the exact MINI OE replacement, or the NTK replacement:NGK 25648 Oxygen Sensor - NGK/NTK PackagingThe original sensors are manufactured by NTK, so those should truly be an exact replacement. However, I have yet to install my NTK replacement, so I cannot confirm. Hoping to try it soon."
5,Really Yummy!,"The bar is a dark green color so I was a little hesitant at first...but I was really surprised! They are excellent. And so incredibly good for you! I had my very first one today, and I think I'm going to try the powders out, too."
2,Are You People on Crack?,"This food bar may good nutritionally, but it tastes like Satan taking a poo in your mouth.....after he was out drinking all night and eating fast food."
1,Such a shame they changed the formula!!!!!,"I was such a fan of the old formula and would stock up and buy boxes at a time. I have a heavy work and travel schedule and this was the perfect bar for eating ""healthy on the go."" Now the calorie and fat content is much higher and the taste has changed for the worse! I wish the company would go back to the original formula....I am on the hunt for another bar! Such a shame...it was the best bar on the market!"
1,would not hold air!,"would not hold air! After one use, it would deflate. Bought this ball for my teen grand-daughter and was quite embarrased at the results."
2,"wrong size, cheap ball","Ordered a size 5 but received a size 3, too small for adults to use as a soccer ball. Guess it gets donated to the kid next door."
2,I hope it wasn't the same as the last one.,"Although the last book was pretty good, the books have totally changed and that is NOT a good idea. The fact that this new book is based on Christina's cousin seems wrong. Joanna Campbell was and is the best author of these books. I am looking foreward to the Ashleigh series!"
1,Who the heck???,"Who in the world is Melanie? Is she one of Christine's friends, or what? I have the feeling Allison Estes is trying to turn this into a multi-character series, like Saddle Club--you know, where one book's about one character, the following about another? Please, Joanna Campbell, I don't knew where you went, but, for Thoroughbred's sake, COME BACK!"
4,Melanie's OK,I enjoyed learing more how Melanie got to be with the Reese's. She feels horrible about her accident with Milky Way her beloved horse. Her best friend didn't take the blame. She goes to Whiitebrook and finds Pirate. he acts up so they have to geld him. I don't want to tell the rest because it wouldn't be fair.
1,WHAT IS UP WITH JOANNA?,"You reading these reviews, notice how they are all incredibly bad? THAT'S BECAUSE JOANNA IS GONE!!!!Come back Joanna! Thoroughbred needs you. All the thoroghbred books were so good untill you left!"
2,at least it had a bit of racing in it,"This book was just a teeny bit better than #24.At least it had some racing in it and was a about a racer. Even though Melanie is a snot, I'd rather have the books be about her, since she likes racing. But the book still had some really stupid mistakes. And at times I got lost. Alison Estes needs to learn how to write and stay on focus.And in this book, christina was such a brat, she shouldn't be allowed near the horses... I noticed on the back of the new books, it says""A new generation of riders at Whitebrook"" not only riders but horses too.Every book there is a new horse character, like why wasn't Pirate mentioned before?Estes needs to stick to 1 horse for a few books and not switch back and forth between characters."
2,"""Disappointing""","I was very disappointed with this book. It was a total turn-off. Borderline porn. Reminded me of something I once read by Ms. Corum. Vulgar and crude. As you might imagine, I will not be reading more books written by these two authors any time soon. Yuck!"
2,Don't buy if your bulb burst,Do not buy this if your bulb has burst. There will be powder all over the mirrors and lenses inside the projector (mine was an X1). Unless you clean out the projector the image will be ruined. There is one lens made of soft plastic & it will surely be scratched by the time you get all the powder off it. InFocus will not sell any internal parts and the minnimum repair fee is $250. So you will have to pay another $250+shipping to have them clean out the projector in addition to the cost of the bulb. If your bulb has burst you may be better off buying a used projector that works still.
3,easy,"I asked for a 4.000 hour lamp, but I think they don't produce any more. Very easy to install, but it's expensive"
1,Meadium size is too tight for size 32.,I bought meadium size thrusses for my 95 years old father . He is size 32. The medium size trusses were too tight for him.
3,support,I ordered this for my husband and it seems to work ok but he wishes they would make them look like boxer briefs instead of tighty whities.. It doesnt cover his private area as well as he would like it.. We would order them again if had to..
2,Not crazy about it...,"Not at all comfortable! I thought the photo might have been of the truss being used over a pair of briefs, but it is all part of the truss and is overkill. I'll never wear it. I got the Inguinal Hernia Aid from Alpha Medical, through Amazon, and really like that one!"
3,size,"The quality of the item is good, however the measurement table does not relate to the actual fitting of the item. I would suggest a larger size than the one the chart recommends. As you cannot return the item if it does not fit you are stuck. I fell in the middle of the measurement chart and it is too small."
4,Good product for post-hernia repair also.,"I had swelling after hernia surgery and some pain while standing. This truss was a good fit to contain the swelling and let me tolerate standing positions. Too tight, but I think you really need something very adjusted to your body."
2,TOM AND JERRY,EVERY THING WAS GREAT EXCEPT VOL 1 OF THE TOM AND JERRY SET ONLY CAME WITH ONE DVD. THE SET CAME WITH TWO.
2,what I was able to hear was wonderful...,"I bought this used and the CD was advertised as ""used--very good."" However, the CD was damaged and it stuck about a third of the way through. Wasted money."
1,falling apart,"I recently purchased these boots from a store in Boston. I waterproofed them and cared for them well. These are my first pair of Kenneth Cole shoes, and I was very excited about them. They may well be my last pair of Kenneth Cole shoes, however. Within a month of purchase there were holes in the soles of the boots and now that another month has passed the soles are coming off. I thought my money would be well spent at Kenneth Cole. The boots are stylish, of course, but I expected to get more than a month's worth of use out of them. I'm very dissapointed at how cheaply made these shoes are. I have contacted Kenneth Cole, but am yet to hear a reply. I will update this review with how they respond."
4,Gives a better understanding of Saints,I have always thought Saints are millions of miles away from me. But this book gave me an understanding that saints are closer to me and that they are just like you and me with lot more love. This book gives you a confidence in life.
5,Another great sign,Mom loved them.They were her present for Christmas.She has them up on her wall.Thanks.
5,Battle God's way,"These were ideas I been been following, but it was very good to understand at a deeper level the hierarchy of God and the enemy."
2,Runs large,I bought this for a 4 yr old girl but it would fit a much larger child. The size was misleading.
4,Pleased,This is a really nice system - especially for the price. I've only had mine for about a month but am already very pleased with it. It fits on our dresser very nicely and does not interfer with us watching TV (we keep it on the low setting). We have not changed the filter yet - but am not worried given the reasonable price for the filters. Great investment!
4,Does the trick!,"I got this for my bedroom because I have a cat and allergies. It has made a difference for me in that I don't have as many problems with sneezing or watery eyes when I wake up in the morning. It is a bit loud for a bedroom, though. I started out turning on low at night but I've gotten used to the sound and can keep it on medium or high now with no problems. But, take that with a grain of salt because I can sleep through a lot of noise!"
4,can't beat it,"I didnt give it five stars because I only bought two different brands but this one kicked butt. My friend with severe asthmatic reactions to cat dander and dog hair can now visit without a problem. My friend's smoking doesnt hang in the air and I sleep like a baby without the swollen eyes, stuffy nose or scratchy throat of before and I live near the river...a tough challenge. For the money, you cant beat this one. I am now ordering three more for friends who felt the same way about mine!!! I also like the 'white noise' effect it has at night and the one in the livingroom(I bought two of this style based on opinions offered here) actually makes the 'plug-in' fragrance circulate more evenly and farther throughout the house!!! I love this product!!!!"
1,Replacement Filters No Longer Available!!!,"These WERE great air cleaners. I purchased 6 of them on March 23, 2008 for a charity along with 18 replacement filters. Little did I know, those would be all the filters we'd ever get.I tried to order a number of replacement filters about a week ago right here on Amazon, and after they didn't show up I inquired as to their whereabouts. I was informed that the vendor checked with Hamilton Beach and they are no longer producing the replacement filters.So, I would highly NOT recommend purchasing one of these unless you only intend to use it for 120 days and then throw it away.Have a nice day."
1,Do Not Buy This Air Cleaner,This air cleaner is clearly on its way out. You cannot purchase filters in local stores anymore.I suggest you try to find a replacement filter before you even consider buying this unit. This will make the decision very easy for you. My advice....Your wasting time and money.Have a good day
2,Frequent buyer,"High price does not justify the plastic shade but that was as described, so not really the issue. Received defective remote control that did not work at all. Apparently remote controls with this type of Adesso lights are typically problematic. Bought a different Adesso torchiere before with remote control & diminishing light and that remote also gave some trouble. Adesso certainly hasn't mastered remote control technology for these lights. Stay away."
1,"Apt title, this cd is a Turkey !!!","First, I love the Kinks and to me Davies is the heart & soul of the group. That said this cd has five songs on it that can all be found on the Davies first solo cd ""Other Peoples Lives"""
1,Teach Yourself Reiki,"This is only the second book I've read about Reiki. The title of the book is very misleading. After I bought the book and read it, I found out, according to the author, one needs to be taught by a Reiki master. Therefore, you cannot teach yourself Reiki. Do not waste your money on this book if that is your intent."
2,DO not buy this product,Tried my best to make this product work but failed to get consistent performance over 1 month. Had to return the product back to Amazon. Used an alternative product with no issues from a coompetitor.
2,Absolutely useless,"This is completely useless, unless you have a relative on it. I bought it hoping to get information on my ancestors, but if they aren't on it, they aren't."
1,Not really for a little kids room,This isn't really for a little kid's room. It's a plate in front of a bulb so the kid can get right to the bulb. Not what I was looking for.
5,GLAM HEELS,"These heels are very chic and sexy--and glamorous. The color is rich; the style is very cool and quite different from your run-of-the-mill pump. The fit is accurate and they're very comfortable, too."
3,not falling,if you here this before falling sickness's other stuff you'll notice a big difference. This cd is somewhat hardcore and their other stuff is not as hard with ska chords. but they still have the same spead and tempo. it's good cd if you like hardcore punk. i don't know anything about dysentery.
5,Great pocket sized drug book!,"This is a very small, but very thorough drug guide! Perfect for nurses is a hospital setting. Has all the latest drugs and info I need to do my job! Fits great in lab coat or scrub pockets!"
1,No help at all!,"Unfortunately this product is very frustrating to use. I have a very clear speaking voice, no strong accent of any type, and after days of trying to train it, it still had a difficult time understanding my words. I finally gave up and went back to typing. I would not recommend this product at any price."
4,Very hot stuff,"I'm not even a lesbian (actually, I'm a guy) and I dug this book a lot. This is some good stuff -- no filler, just lots of steamy, graphically detailed (but genuinely erotic) sex -- none of that ""her tenderness opened the flower of her lovingness"" stuff readers of erotic literature know all too well here. A bit too much butch/femme roleplaying for my tastes (I fully support a woman's right to be named ""Hank,"" but I don't necessarily need to see her having sex), but then, of course, this book wasn't intended for me. Good stories, recommended."
1,"damp maybe, but not wet","not the best collection of erotica i've read by a long shot. most of the stories are poorly written, even if they do deliver the sex promised. they're very amateur-level stories, with no consideration for narrative flow, or dialogue or any of the other things needed to make an erotica piece a WELL-WRITTEN erotica piece.if sex is what you're looking for, this is okay. otherwise, move on to another collection."
5,A book that lives up to its title.,"This is one of the better collections of lesbian erotic short stories I have come across. The writing is quite good and the stories are indeed quite graphic and realistic at the same time. I am not much of a visual person; I do not really get turned on by pictures or movies, but reading many of these stories certainly got the juices flowing. I suppose having a vivid imagination helps, and I suppose having ""been there, done that"" does not hurt, but this book certainly was well named. After reading a story or two you will be much like the title of the book."
1,Not what I expected ... VERY disappointed,"Way too depressing, sordid, vulgar. I bought it to read on the train. I could not wait to get it and read it. I tossed it in a 40 gallon drum at the train station when I got to page 17 or 25 or whatever ... don't remember. And I'm no prude, believe me. Definitely not what I want to invest time on in my life."
5,pass it on,Craig Ferguson is at the top of his game in this book. I hope that any adult who enjoys laughing will pick up this book. I have passed this book on to many people.
1,very disappointing,"I absolutely love Craig's sense of humor on ""The Late Late Show."" This book is just plain stupid. I really have no other words for it. I defy anyone to read the first chapter and not think, well, OK, so what? I've read better on Glasgow street life and on these sort of relationships gone awry.Sorry, did not get this at all."
5,Product got our washing machine up and running in minutes,"We ordered a washer pump from Amazon. The part was perfect but Amazon's shipping department sent the part through the wrong shipper and their was some confusion with receiving the part. The part, however came to us in perfect condition and had the washer up and running in no time.Jan Lohman"
2,Not a high quality product...,"I've owned 2 Calvin Klein belts and 1 wallet, and all have broke on me. I didn't do anything out of the ordinary, they just broke due to poor quality. I will stay away from CK accessory products from now on.This wallet started out really tight, with all the pockets (3) barely fitting one card each, and the money clip was so tight I could only fit maybe 3-4 bills. After a few months, it loosened a bit. And after a few more months, it loosened so much that the clip broke, making it useless. The metal clip is just a horrible design and CK needs to discontinue it."
2,What a let down,"I really culdn't wait for RCT3 to be released after i'd spent so much time having fun on RCT2. But what a disapointment, nothing to do with the graphics or sound etc,just not a patch on the original games. For me personally, i don't think they needed to go 3D with the graphics, there was nothing wrong with how they were. the game play is just nowhere near as enjoyable as th RCT2, the fact that it keeps changing from night to day is quite annoying too, some people may prefer this,but certainly not me. As a massive fan of RCT2, i can honestly say i wish i hadn't wasted my money on RCT3, the original will always be best for me, but that is just my opinion."
4,Great game if you have a good PC,"I got this game a while ago but i haven't been able to play it till now because i didn't have a good graphics card but once i got a one, this game was great and if you have Soaked and Wild this game is even better. If you have a good PC then this is a great game. GREAT BUY"
2,Buyer beware - needs patch,"The game in its boxed retail state is full of show-stopping gameplay bugs and requires massive hardware to run smoothly. I have an XP 2400+ (~2 Ghz) / 512 PC2100 / 9800 Pro 128Mb and feel lucky to get 15-20 fps with just 600 peeps in the park. With a park full of 1000+ peeps at nighttime, by frames per second went down to between 4 and 6. You can see the full list of bugs by going to the Atari forums for the game. The bottom line - don't buy this until they release a patch that addresses issues with peep AI and performance."
1,Beware System Requirements,"Midlevel PC. Experienced user.Can not get product to run. Appears I need to buy a brand new PC just to run $35 game. Atari's response: ""contact the retailer"". As if they don't know that no retailer will accept an opened game.Buy something else"
1,Good system - Game won't run - no help from support,"I'm computer literate, have a six month old system with 512 ram, 64mb ram s3 video, 70 gb hd, 1.4 ghz athlon.This game starts to load the park and then reboots the entire system. Dxdiag passed all tests, uninstall reinstall, reinstall of directx 9, etc. Tried everything, no help from tech (gee sorry).Forget about unless you just like to take risks."
2,Not as good as RollerCoaster Tycoon 2,"The title pretty much sums it up... The game is much more like Sim Theme Park. Unlike RCT2, you have a career and have to unlock parks as you play. The game also did not install to a computer with 192 MB memory (Windows XP, and I know the min. requirements are 256 MB), but it does work on a computer with 256 MB. However, it is very unresponsive and the controls are more confusing than in RCT2."
2,RCT 2 is better,"I have all of the RCT games, the board game, all expansions, and a few other Tycoon games. I was completely disappointed with this game, however, because it was not only broken the first day I got it, but it was also very confusing. The 3D graphics had a negative effect on the game, in my opinion, because it made it a bit more slow-moving. My Peep Editor doesn't work, so I cannot create my own family. It's pretty confusing how to make firework shows and everything, even when I read the whole instruction booklet.I don't recommend this game, as it isn't that great. Instead, buy RCT 2 or even 1 at a discounted price, since these are the older games."
3,1 Step forward and 2 Back,"The 3D graphics add nothing to this game. It feels slugish and clunky and never responsive. The terraforming tools are fantastic but not being able to build tunnels is just stupid. Yes you can dig a trench, build your ride and cover it with roof tiles but it doesnt offer the fleibility found in RCT 1 and 2. Only 4 themes is very limiting and being 3D, adding your own game objects will be a lot more difficult than the sprite creation of the older games. Elevated paths are also a real pain to create. It also crashes a lot too. This game is a barrier that stops the gamer from realising their theme park imagination. You are better off buying RCT 2 and its 2 add on packs than this game. I cant beleive that there is a RCT 3 add on pack in the pipeline when so many improvements still need to be made to the core game. This game in one word: Frustrating."
3,Not What I Expected,"If you are looking for a content and organization guide to start a podcast, then this is the book for you. If you, like me need technical information on the act of podcasting then there are better choices. There is some information on recording and posting, but the book spends the vast majority of it's time on things like structuring your podcast and reaching a wide audience."
4,"This is NOT a Hi8, it is 8mm XR!","I own this one, and finally after ~10 years of moderate use it seems to be dying (suddenly no recording or playback). This camera is a good one for the purpose (easy to use, a pretty good quality of recording), but it is not a Hi8 format, but a lower Video8XR [...]. It is essentially the same format as the original Video8, but ""with 10% improvement in luminance detail while retaining full backward compatibility with older, non-XR equipment. XR recordings were fully playable on the older equipment, though without the benefits of XR"". By the way, the format is clearly shows in one of the shots.So you get a pretty good Video8 camera, but not a Hi8 one!"
1,poor sound quality,"This is a wonderful collection of Steppenwolf. However, I was unaware that this CD set was transfered from analog tape and absolutely contains hiss and anomalies. I would have never purchased this particular recording on CD. The sound quality is so poor that it can only be listened to at a low volume level-quite unfortunate for tunes such as Born to Be Wild, Sookie Sookie and Magic Carpet Ride. Don't waste your money if you have become accustomed to and expect excellent sound quality from a CD. The music is good-just should have been digitally remastered or why bother?"
5,I love this movie!,Brooke Adams and Tony Shalhoub shine in this fantastic film about a woman's (Adams) reconciliation with mid-life. Expertly written by Lynn Adams and directed by Shalhoub. Brooke Adams performance is her best ever and is NOT to be missed.
5,Great book for effective work,"I am a former graphic worker and I now teach this matter to students who have no ideas of the state of the art.The book is professionnal and easy to use, and all examples are so helpfull to any people who need advices in business graphics."
2,The novel was disjointed and characters are out of joint,"Since a nice synopsis of this book already exist at the web site, I will skip this. The problems with the book, in my opinion is in the character of the heroine. She is a circus performer and daughter of a gypsy with prediliction for 1990's new age philosophy and mother earth religion. The character is just out of step with the setting. She is also suprisingly helpless for someone with such a non-traditional upbringing. The sterotypical damaged hero is not badly written. The sex scenes which I believe are essential to this type of story are dececntly done. The plot itself is lacking,even if one suspends one's belief this story not credible."
3,Papo Toys,"My son wanted a wizard to go with his castle and Knight sets. Merlin is a good option. Although, my son does not play with him very much. He is more into the knights."
4,"Funky, Funky Stuff","While I have many other B.T. CDs & vinyls, this is my best and favorite. There are not so many live soul & dance CD albums from 70-80s, so I suppose it can be categorized as ''rare.'' You can enjoy the real funky performance by B.T. as soon as you get started the CD!As a minor quibble I would say the length of time 54:32 is too short for one CD, but considering almost all their representative hits of Have Some Fun (extended play of 7:02), Give Up The Funk, Shout It Out, Peace Pipe, Do It and Express are included here, it might as well be disregarded. A recommendation for ''genuine'' 70-80s soul & dance fans."
5,Great bath toy,"These are great bath stickers. My 3 year old loves them. They actually stick to the tub, they dry out completely in their mesh bag between baths (avoiding mildew) and they're sturdy enough that my 10 month old can chew on them a bit without ending up with foam in his mouth. Lots of bathtime fun."
4,Best of Chikara (short review),"I am a fan of professional wrestling. I am a fan of the mid-west indy scene, of ROH, NOAH, Dragon Gate, NWA, WCCW, ECW (not WWE-CW) and yes, even WSX. I have seen some of the Chikara talent on Ring of Honor shows and have to say I was impressed. I have visited the Chikara website many times and wondered about the type of show they put on. After purchasing the Best of Chikara dvd, I must say I am now a fan. The dvd compiles a great mix of wrestling styles and in ring experience. The individual gear worn by some of the wrestlers is very creative and colorful. I was very impressed by the Lucha/Japanese/European/traditional mix of wrestling crammed into this dvd. I would highly recommend this dvd to even the casual wrestling fan. It may introduce you to professional wrestling as you've probably never seen it before."
4,"Epic, huh","Shout at the Devil is tauted as a sizzling epic of love, war and revenge on the back of the tape's box. It did have have war and revenge, but not quite of epic proportions. It did have a love angle. That love angle, spliced with the war and revenge, slowed down the action and the plot considerably. The director used Africa's scenery to a capital advantage. Too bad scenery can't win an Oscar. One scene even required a WWI airplane surveillance; better to show off more of that scenery. Marvin, as a Cat Ballou style drunk, was at his acting best. Moore handled his role superbly as a Britisher duped by Marvin. It was a dandy Adventure film with long love scenes that give you time to make popcorn or visit the chalet de necessite. I would have given this movie five stars, but the love angle--with a John Wayne style brawl between Marvin and Moore-- was a bit overdone."
1,Shout at the Devil,"I am totally disappointed in this movie. It isn't in English, nor will it play on any dvd. It has a different format. I really feel I was deceived on this product for no where did I notice that it wasn't in English. I have a product that cost me $27 and unable to enjoy it."
3,The Luck of the Draw,Pollock's was not a particularly noteworthy WWII submarine cruise history thus the action accounts were limited. It was more interesting to me as a fairly graphic account of a sailor's life aboard the sub...and in this case the ship and crew survived!
3,Proofreader Anyone?,"I just started reading the book, so I can't give a full review. The first 60 or so pages are so filled with typos, I wonder how the publisher got it to press. The story itself is very interesting, but it's hard to get past missing words and periods."
3,Travel Connect Four Game,This is not really a game you should use in the car or on a plane because it's too easy to lose the small chips. We played it at home most of the time.
2,"meh color, itchy","This color is a matte taupe plum that looked promising for a subdued look. After putting it on, my eyelids started itching which has never happened with other eyeshadows. The color payoff is also pretty low."
3,Short on Hours,We purchased this fuel for the first time in December an the first 12 cans lasted 3+ hours. The other 12 and this box of 24 only last 2 to 2 1/2 hours if lucky. Not sure why!
1,Burn time,"does not burn long enough and if spilled will cause a big flame. Seems a little dangerous. Only a couple of hours of good heat. If i had it to do over, I would have gotten an electric"
3,Hard store the left over part,"it's pretty good if you finish whole can at once, but if you save some parts for next day or next use, it's hard to make sure the quality. it will have some odor plus it won't generate as nice flame as like first open."
3,Quick burn!,"These look awesome and sound like real flames, but they do not last long at all! Very expensive to burn. Will be using candles more than these."
4,Easy to use,Use of the gel fuel is very easy. For a fire lasting about 3 hours the price of around $8.00 for 3 cannisters the value is good.
3,Questionable,"I received the cans quickly, but was wondering why the cans I received had the old labels, from 1.5 years ago, and not the new as in the pictured above. Again I need to know as the company states that this product should be used within a year. Do I have new product, or something thats been sitting on a shelf for well over a year? Do you think someone may read this and reply, 2nd time."
3,takes too long to toast,The toaster is made of very flimsy materials and it takes over 5 minutes to toast a bagel on the highest setting and it doesnt even toast it dark! Maybe if you have a lot of time on your hands this will be the toaster for you.
3,"OK, but that's all","This product did a nice job initially, but it did not last any longer than anything else I have tried. Jeep Cherokee Sport with sun-faded trim all around."
5,Sometime's It's Tough to Fall Asleep,"Snowbaby could not sleep. He snuggled an extra snow blanket. He tried counting snowflakes. He asked for a drink of water. Then, Snowmama and Snowpapa had an idea. With a snip and a clip, they made Snowbaby a special surprise...and everyone drifted off to sleep.With interesting illustrations and a glimpse inside the life of snow people, Snowbaby Could Not Sleep will be a special sleepytime book for Snowbabies and real babies everywhere."
2,Not much meat to it,"Just finished reading this book and found there just wasn't much meat to it. Some of the examples (there aren't many throughout) between parent and child coversations didn't seem realistic. I also agree with the other reviewer that much of it is very repetitive throughout. It wasn't until the last two or so chapters that I felt I was getting some good information that would be useful.To sum it up:Parent through guiding not punishing or being too permissive.Have family meetings to discuss issues that each person wants to addressEach child should have their own identity in the familyChildren should be heard, listend to, so that they know their feelings matter as much as yours doThey highly recommend a child development class or a book. That's why I'm here now, to get a book!"
5,Very Good!,Sensei Dalke is an amazing karate-ka. The video brings a precise explanation about the techniques. As a brazilian karate-ka I was very impressed. Congratulations!
2,Rips too easily,"We purchased this set because we wanted to get the matching sheets (thought they were adorable). However, when we went to put them on over the matress pad, the sheet tore on the end. The sheet is made too small (or tight fitting) to use with the mattress pad. We tried to get it on our mattress without the padding, but it barely fit. The rest of this set is great, but the sheets are poorly made."
4,The Morning After...and I'm still playing this song,"Ok let's get to the bottom line of this ""Alter Ego"" release. It's as if Tyrese made disc 1 for his fans and then disc 2 was just like he said...here take this too and check it out...lol. I love Tyrese! And the 1st disc is great all the way through. You got tracks like...""One"", ""Turn Ya Out"" and my favorite...""Morning After"", I got that one on repeat. It's hot!A lot of people are taking this Black Ty disc too serious. It's not all that bad. The real album is disc 1, so judge the album based on that one. So I rated the Album with 4 stars, because it's a double disc and I wasn't feeling the second one. So stop talking about Tyrese the rapper and focus on the Tyrese the singer and I garantee you won't be disappointed if you do so. So buy it for the slow jams...Dammit!"
2,It was small,"For the price I paid for this I expected it to be a lot larger. Looks larger in the picture. My neice likes it and I bought it for her, so thats all that really matters. It did ship in a timely manner."
2,Ordered new unit and received refurbished unit.,"The unit itself is ok, other than the battery was completely dead on arrival. The real problem is I ordered a new unit, on sale directly from Amazon and I was sent a refurbished unit, with the previous users home address and destination addresses still in the memory of the GPS. I finally found the phone number for Amazon, which isn't easy. They should have sent me a new unit and picked up my refurbished unit. Instead, I have to send back the unit I received, for a refund. The new units are no longer on sale, so I would have to buy a refurbished unit or pay a lot more. I said ok, then just credit me the difference of what I paid for a new one, to the price you sell a refurbished one for. Amazon said, ""no"". Part of my purchase price was a gift card, so, I am afraid things will get even more screwed up if I return it. I am very disappointed with Amazon."
1,not worth it,It has very limited POI and the map seems to be outdated also. I tried to find Best Buy and Staples but none could be found within 50 miles. There is a Best Buy within 10 miles and a Staples not too far away. The directions seem to be quite accurate but I don't like the fact that it doesn't tell you to make the turn. It just beeps or dings depending on your setting. The display is limited in information too. It's going to go back to the store.
4,Magellan Maestro 4000,GPS works well; easy to see and use interface. Upgraded maps will be a plus in late 2008. Great value for the price.
5,Great product,Amazing product that is simple to use with very little instruction. Very intuitive. Pretty accurate too
2,Good song - horrible voice,"It's not that I have a problem with the song, the song itself is good, it's just the singer's voice that I find totally annoying. I don't like his voice at all."
2,A Man's Gotta Eat,"For many years Crews has been one of my favorite novelists; his personal life is an astonishing example of how endurance can conquer tragedy. Futhermore, the early '90s books, BODY and THE KNOCKOUT ARTIST had him back on the track he had cut with the early novels. Unfortunately, the same can not be said for this near travesty. MULCHING, as an idea, has great promise, but the work reads like a rough draft. The author wants so badly for the audience to embrace the bizarre protagonists of this book, that he sacrifices plot and often sense to accomodate them. Rather than a scathing sendup on American business, MULCHING becomes a parody of its own ideas, a product without substance."
4,"An insane, inspired look at corporate America","I had the wrong impression of this book. I thought it was one of those character portraits, eccentric and revealing, at least of the poor sclub which it details. Wow, was I wrong. I was right that it was eccentric, but it was so in a completely different fashion from what I'd imagined. 'The Mulching Of America' is an absurdist fantasy in all senses of the word but, at heart it really is quite a clever commentary. I recommend this book for it's inventiveness, if not for it's ridiculousness."
3,Very few useful topics,I don't have any SQL experience before. I recently took the IZ0-007 exam and got 47 out of 52. Didn't depend much on this book. The practice exams that came with the CD were not that useful. To me they were really hard. Only few topics were helpful. The language is very hard to understand. I would suggest to buy the Self Test Software.
3,Astonishing number of errors!,"There is no such thing as an error free technical book, but this one sets a new high-water mark for errors. Don't even begin without incorporating all the changes from the errata - which cover perhaps 3/4 of the errors. And there are even errors in the errata! The book has lost so much credibility with me that I find myself reading with considerable skepticism. Fortunately I have several years of Oracle SQL experience, so if something looks suspicious I just go to OTN to check.All that said, the book is well designed as far as subject presentation (tho I would move data types to beginning), uses lots of clear (& usually correct) examples, and covers most of the material needed. I would probably purchase it again."
5,"Pretty cool, great lamp for photos",I bought this item to supplement my lack of sun during the day; but it's turned into an extra light for my macro photo work. There are just times that this light really adds something to my photos.-TJ
1,Was this book written for kids?,"I've never read a book with am more predictable, mundane plot than Article 23. About half way through the book I began to wonder if it was written for younger readers. The idea of using towers to climb into space was interesting, yet served no useful function in the book besides being a unique way of getting the characters into space. I got so fed up with it that around 2/3 of the way through, I had to skip to the end just to be done with it. Of course, the ending was exactly what I expected, making me glad I did not waste any more time reading the book."
5,Another great Margaret Maron book.,I was involved from the beginning to the end - had a hard time putting it down when I had other things to do.
1,Does not work via CrossOver/Wine,"Mac OS users running Crossover or Wineskin might want to look somewhere else. I could not get this to work using Wine because the Amazon installer would not run. Oh well, there goes ten dollars. I guess if I ever get a PC, I can try it again."
5,fantastic,"this game is fantastic and absolutly fun to play. addicting nonetheless.i am playing this game on windows 7 home edition and runs fine. if you are eperiancing problems then do not delete the folder that downloads onto your desktop, open it and run setup, after finished an icon will show up. do not relocate the folder or icon or delete them. it should work fine."
4,A friend in need,"This radio can be used under most every lighting and power condition (I don't know how weather/water-proof it may be). It has a ""big"" speaker, so the sound quality is great. The tuning is a little touchy, but the analogue tuning permits tuning in distance weak stations between strong local stations in the AM band. The various type of provided chargers all work, but the included rechargeable batteries are wimpy being rated at 500 ma, so I replaced them with 2300 ma rechargeables.Two items I wished it had are 1.) a means to switch off the dial light to save power, and 2.) a tuneable means to switch instantly to the weather band so that in an emergency you could quickly switch between local ememrgency broadcasts and the weather band without having to retune in the stations."
5,Perfect Fit for Motorola V3 RAZR cellphone,"This case is excellent as a case for the Motorola V3 RAZR cellphone (as well as for its intended use with a Panasonic FX01 camera). The V3 RAZR just happens to be the same size as an FX01, so the advantages of this case apply for the cellphone as well--horizontal form factor, closed belt loop that can slide, secure magnetic catch, easy to open and extract with one hand. (The cameras that fit this case are now discontinued and their replacements are larger, so get one of these for your V3 RAZR while the case is still in production.)"
2,C:31:23 error,I've been getting the C:31:23 error message on CCD-TRV36 model. Bought this unit four years ago and used it rarely (max 60hrs). I have contact SONY several times. The off-shore tech support suggest I spend $200 and send this to Sony and they will fix it for me (all labor and no parts needed!) They probably have an easy fix for it and are not willing to post it on their web site. Why should they when they can make $200! I told tech support I can buy a brand new digital one for $350 and it will defiantly not be a Sony brand. I have put in brand new Sony tape and brand new rechargeable battery and it did not fix this issue.
1,Why Oh Why...,"Do I keep picking these duds? It's funny that this book quotes an African proverb ""If you want to know the end, look at the beginning"" like it's actually going to have a point.The first chapter introduces you to the title character, trifling, no good mother Zsaset. She makes herself out to be so smart but jumps from men like a fly jumps to --well you know what I mean. Zsaset doesn't learn from her mistakes, drags her daughter from man to man, while leaving her sick mother to raise her son.Unfortunately, there are women in real life like Zsaset, I'd just rather not waste 260 pages reading about them. Bottom line, this is a waste of time."
1,Made in someone's garage?,"This learning system is extraordinarily unprofessional! Not only is it practically non-scripted, but the french pronunciation goes by so quickly, it's difficult to repeat it (even though the ... narrator continually urges: ""Make Sure you're repeating this, Listener""). Comes with two tapes and xeroxed pages stapled together. ..."
3,Great idea but too small....,"Unfortunately, the product description doesn't mention the size. I've been looking for biodegradable products for a party we are hosting. I was very excited when I found these and read the positive reviews. However, when they arrived today, I saw that the knife, fork, and spoon are barely 6 inches. Disappointing, I won't be able to use these child size utensils for a dinner. They seem sturdy and would be fine for casual occasions. Anyway, I'm still looking for full-size environmentally friendly cutlery, despite my need to use disposables."

4,Amazing!,I have only been using this product a month but I have already seen results. I can't give it 5 stars unless I actually get pregnant but at this moment it has already improved my energy level and I am back on a regular female schedule without any other drug or vitamin supplement! I've had 10 years of abnormalities and in 30 days this is correcting all of that.
1,Dissapointed,"You can download a free version from the website.This version appears to be out of date and it is not the ""gold"" edition. The serial number is over 5 years old and out of date.I attempted to sync the family tree from [...], but it failed to work. When using the downloaded version, it worked much easier."
1,Watch out!,"I'm returning my Betty Scott, after listening to only 4 songs, each of which starts with the same yearning yawning earnest delivery & boy, one doesnt need to hear much more of this. Lennie tinkling, barely."
4,Good,"I liked this book. Although at times it got a little boring. I thought it was neat that Lisa rode a horse named Jasper. That's my horse's name too. I also knows how she feels about being afraid to ride again after a tumble. I too have taken a few spills at a canter,and was kind of afraid to try it again. But she got over it and so did I!"
5,Best French Dictionary Ever!,"My wife speaks French, and is teaching me and my 2-year-old son to speak French as well. I have many boring adult French dictionaries. None of them are anywhere near as good as Richard Scarry's Livre des Mots. This book is packed full of words. And the pictures make learning them more fun, and more memorable too! Simply put, this is the BEST FRENCH DICTIONARY EVER! And the only place I have ever found it is here. Thanks, AMAZON.CA!"
1,terrible writing,"I picked this book up at the library. Didn't know that it was a sequel to another book which I hadn't read. The prologue was great. Good introduction to the characters. But then it fell apart. Gwen is handling 3 separate and unrelated cases and her attention is too divided to let the reader develop any interest in any of her clients. Seemed like most of the book was discussions about things that happened 'off stage'. I never did catch the reason the ME was killed, and I was very annoyed at the heroine revealed the solution to the missing woman's case. (not enough details given for the reader to figure it out with her)."
5,Suzy's Zoo A Great Buy,"As an educator and mother of a toddler, I found that Suzy's Zoo to be very educational and an attention holder. My 20 month old daughter really enjoys placing the cards on the correct object and repeating the names of the pictures. This game is helping my daughter to name objects instead of just pointing to them."
4,Ephesians commentary review,"This book was exactly in the condition that the seller promised it would be. It was an older copy of Stott's commentary, but it is what I need for my library."
2,Mead vinyl loose-leaf #46030,"Just what I needed. This same notebook twenty years ago lasted me for 15 years. However this new cheaper model only last a year or two without cracking and beginning to fall apart. Obviously outsourced there is no other manufacturer I'm aware of that makes this size. Hence, this is okay, but not the former quality."

3,Okay but nothing special,This was an okay book. Nothing special. Could have had more of a spiritual side to it. Print and pictures were okay.
5,Very Helpful in Understanding,"This book seemed to really help my 2 yr old son understand what we were celebrating. He went around telling everyone at our family dinners that ""Thanksgiving is for giving thanks"". He even told Santa at the mall...""Happy Thanksgiving"". :)"
5,"Don't Wait Until Next Week......Get This Album ""This Week""","Simply put, Jean has done it again. Don't dub Jean as a ""femcee"" because with her lyrical prowess she can put some of her hardest and fiercest male counterparts to shame. My favorite cut would be ""Watch Me"" with Jean's skills on display once again over a funky jazzy loop. Personally, I would love to see Jean battle a male emcee and see them get ripped to shreds. Non-believers take heed."
2,MEET YOUR MEAT,"The film opens up with some promising girl/girl action before the opening credits. We then switch to 4 young couples who stop in the never ending ""Doom Desert"" on their way to a cabin. The couples range from vegans to a pair that drop acid. Nice to know some things haven't changed since the sixties. The movie consists of a lot of talking/kissing between the couples while something that make ""predator"" type noises stalks them.In this low budget film, you never get to see the creature, just some low budget body parts with bright red blood on them. Heck, we don't even get to see the lizard everyone else sees. There are clues in the conversation about cross species breeding, although nothing is certain.The acting and dialouge weren't half bad. The horror aspect was so-so as it dragged on without us ever seeing a kill or the creature. Available on a 20 pack horror set from Wal Mart for $10.00.Parental Guide: F-bombs, implied sex. Girl/girl action. No nudity."
2,"if your child is older than 3, don't buy this","This truck is fine, except we didn't realize it was a corded remote control truck. (we bought it at a retail store, and could not tell from the packaging). My son, who is four, seems to drag it around more like a leash. I think he thinks it's boring and I'm sure it won't last long that way. Plus, it is pretty loud and not all that fun. Spend a little more and get a non-corded rc truck. (one final note--we only paid $15 for this at a store--I'd be mad if I paid $25)."
2,Rather have a softer ball,"Anyone with boys knows that they like to throw everything! These balls are hard plastic. That's not really what I want my boys to be throwing, especially inside when there are other little kids around. I'd suggest buying a ball that's really meant to be thrown."
5,Best plug ever,Put these plugs in my 2000 Pontiac grand am gt. I don't really beat on my cars so 0-60 times are unknown but I did pick up 2 mpg driving up and down a mountain to work everyday. After my install I had my father put these in his 2005 Tiburon 4 cylinder and he got almost 3 mpg more out of these plugs. In my mind these are the best plugs you can buy.
2,Uneven cords,"While the sound quality of the headphones is good, the cords are of different lengths. I don't see how this is supposed to work, but it looks really funny and is inconvenient. Don't buy these."
2,This book should be catalogued as fiction.,"As you may know by now, the thesis of Mr. Graham's book is ""the South is backward, stupid, and bigoted. It used to be that only the South was this way, but the South has successfully exported its backwardness, stupidity and bigotry to the rest of the country.""The notion that bigotry and stupidity originated in the South is ludicrous, and the assertion that at one time the United States north of the Mason Dixon line was a bastion of progressiveness and acceptance is simply contrary to fact.Next time you write a book, Mr. Graham, back up your assertions with fact. A little research would totally disprove your notion that racial problems, closed-mindedness and ignorance were at some point ""acquired"" by the rest of the country by virtue of the South's influence. Unfortunately, they've been there all along."
2,Self Proclaimed Obnoxious A$$,"...This book is supposed to be humor, but I find very little humor in constantly knocking your own roots, and mocking sarcasm about everything that suits his fancy. If you don't mind being insulted, (whether Southern or not) feel free to buy this. Otherwise your money would be better spent elsewhere."
1,"Continuing the stereotypes of the South, without originality","I cannot recall having read a book written with more contempt for the South and its people. This author surely must have had a most unhappy childhood after he moved to South Carolina, at a young age. His characterizations of Southerners must have been influenced strongly by his nurturing mother, who was also from the South(Southern California),as they faithfully follow the tiresome stereotypes of Hollywood. We've all heard most of his""humorous descriptions of the typical Southerner"" many many times. His innovative ""discovery"" that racial prejudice and other low-minded traits exist outside the South, must be seen as truly insightful, according to the book jacket and other on-line reviews. To quote one of the Mr. Graham's favorite sources, ""noone ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American Public."" I'm sure this book will sell."
4,Good product for a Starter,I have been using the Sony TRV66 for the last two weeks and have found that it satisfies all my needs.
3,Does not dry quickly but good otherwise,"Note that this is 6 mil paper. Most photo paper is closer to 9 or 10 mil so this is thinner than usual. It is still thick enough for me, it still feels like a photo. I have an Epson printer. I've used Epson papers before without any issues, but when using this paper, each sheet must be removed before the printer lays the next one on it or the ink will lift onto the back of the other sheet. They do tend to stick together afterward, but I've not had paint peel after they've dried. The look of the finished product is fine, but when I print 4x6 photos, I usually print 20 or 30 at a time so I can't leave the printer until all are done - and this means babysitting the printer for an hour. Epson paper costs about the same, and it is thicker and dries better so I'll buy it next time."
2,Not worth it.,It's flimsy. Not sure how many years it will last. It IS pretty. Better to go to your local home center depot ace lowes place and buy one there.
3,Review,I read this book for background information for a paper that I needed to write. It gave me the basic information on Russian Jewish immigrants living in New York. I propbably would not have read the book for any other reason than research.
1,Complete garbage.,"I have never been so disappointed by a book in my life. I was sincerely, intently looking forward to learning something, and found myself instead slapped with nonsense new-age phrasing and pukeworthy, hokey erotica. This book pretends to 'enlighten,' but teaches nothing but a bit of anatomy that was already familiar to me. I'm deeply disappointed by it, and regret trusting the majority of the positive reviews at amazon in deciding to waste my money on it.I do admit this book didn't bore me, though - I was too busy contorting my face into new manifestations of horror while reading its excessively purple and presuptuous prose to get bored."
3,Disneys Princess Castle Make Up Set,"My 5 year old loves make-up and she liked the make-up set. There is mostly make-up for her lips. I ended up buying additional make-up for her eyes because it wasn't included. It would have been nice if there was make-up for everything: eyes, cheeks and lips with appropriate make-up tools."
3,Good pc version of early Mac game,Cute basic little game. Quite easy for the kids and has different modes for head to head competition for two.
2,His worst album,"I have been a fan of Elton John's since the 1970s. He is one of the all-time greats. This, his poorest-selling album according to VH1, is also the last one you should consider purchasing. No matter how many times I tried, I could not find any memorable, catchy or interesting melodies or lyrics on this CD. His only dud."
1,Johnson Family,This movie was sad. It wasn't funny or interesting. I wish I could have seen a clip/preview of it before I purchased it. Please don't waste your money buying this DVD because it will be a waste of time watching it.
2,Another money taker,I ignore previous reviews on this movies at other websites which suggested you to pick another movie to watch or to buy. After viewing this movie I make the same suggestion. Do not be fooled by the appearance of family comedy.
3,Ho-hum more documentation !,"Okay, so your company now aspires to become a ""Level x"" organization. Until now you probably used a ""code and fix"" methodology. Won't work anymore - processes are in - code heroes are being relegated to the sidelines. Along with across the board improvements, you also need a solid software testing methodology. Yes, a documented process at that.This documented standard probably works best with huge organizations - government agencies could find it useful to stick to the word. I for one, work in the project industry, so I find about 40% of the documentation relevant. Why ? No time.Is it worth having ? Yes, I would recommend it as compulsory reading for all QA Managers / Project leads who need to make the not-so-gentle transition to a ""managed"" or ""repeatable"" level. When you are drafting processes for your organization, open this, plagarize a few ideas and make your own document. So, essentially it qualifies as reference material."
2,Disappointing,"If you're looking for an exciting pioneer story that is full of strong women, cowboys, Indians, and hard times on the trail...this is not it. If you're looking for a story about people that are struggling with their relationships with God and the power of prayer...you found it!"
3,"This album is not my favorite, but Enrique has talent. . . .","Yes, I admit that this album is not one of my favorites, but Enrique displays a potential in music that I believe he has achieved. His voice sounded very young and was not developed as it would be in his next two albums. Once his voice did develope, I believe he displays a deep, playful, and strong voice that needs and demands to be heard. I would also like to say that his voice, by far, reveals every single type of emotion that can be heard by the human ear. In my opinion, he is learning with each new album that he releases and is getting better every time. I hope that you will take my advice and listen to ""Vivir"" and ""Cosas Del Amor"" because you will NOT be disappointed."
1,Looks good.,"Great idea that doesn't work. It jams or sticks repeatedly,and is difficult to clean. It seldom ran more than a day without screwing up.Needs new engineereing and fewer plastic parts."
3,Cheap,"Note, this item is a TOY. This clock is cheap, made of plastic. I bought it thinkint it would be an interesting device to place on my desk. The picture makes it look like some sort of painted steel. Not so. It's entirely plastic, except for the balls. It's also surprisingly small. I expected a big metal machine, and got a cheap little toy. I was disappointed. I wound up giving it to my nephews instead of putting it on my desk."
1,Lasted less than 60 days.,"Got it for a Valentine Day present from my wife. It is now broken, arm rotates erratically. I will contact the manufacturer to see if I have any recourse. Will updata this review after I see if they stand behind it. Its fun while it works, but it doesn't seem to last for long."
1,Don't get it.,"Like many people have said, it is very loud. Think about it, it makes a little noise every minute, then a bigger noise every 5 minutes, then a even bigger noise every hour, then a huge noise every 12 hours. Very very noisy. In addition, it is not accurate. It will keep good time for 30 minutes or so, but for whatever reason (maybe it's slow, maybe the balls don't work properly, I don't really know because I never sat there and watched it to find out what's wrong), it will be off. I made sure to set it to the correct time before I slept, and when I woke up, it was more than an hour slow. I'm not even thinking of returning it. It's just so loud I don't want it anymore."
3,Fun clock!,"My Grandpa had one of these when we were very little kids, I remember staring at it for hours just watching the balls roll. His was waaaay more sturdy than this one. The only thing better on this one is that it allows for battery operation, however it does not come with a wall adapter to plug in. The unit is not level either so it doesn't keep time correctly without some adjustments. They just don't make things like they used to."
4,Time Machine clock,It is interesting to watch this clock work. It came packed well and was easy to set up. It kept good time and should help teach another method of telling time.
1,Provider not responsive,"The product is not working properly and the provider CYI (Can You Imagine) is a disaster, I sent an email claiming and asking for support, they answered that Customer Care was going to contact me but never happened, I sent additional emails and they didn't respond me back, very disappointing."
5,Tabletop clock,This gift was for my son for his office. He thinks it is great. It runs and keeps good time.
4,Awesome,"Bought this as a mostly out of curiosity. For the price, I couldn't go wrong. This would have been 5 Stars if it had come with it's own powerpack. When I tried my own power pack, it wouldn't work. However, after inserting the batteries it has been a source of complete fascination. A number of reviews cited it as being too noisy. In my opinion, it is the sound that is the most endearing feature. It is the first timepiece that literally announces every passing minute. As a watch collector, this inexpensive clock has given me a unique perspective of time."
2,Very loud!,"I tought it would be a lot better. Tis clock it's very loud! The plastic it's cheap, and even for the low price, i don't recommend."
1,PURE GARBAGE,dont waste your money on this thing - It looks pretty cool in the picture - its made of realy flimsy plastic - totally not worth the almost [...] I paid for it - realy cheesy - and not to mention the one I recieved was missing a bunch of balls too - dont bother with this product!
2,Fun but not for keeping time,"I found one of these at a garage sale back in the late 80's and it didn't keep the time right. Fast forward to a few years ago and I decided I wanted to try another one. I don't recall where I bought it from besides online but within a couple of weeks, found again, that they just do not keep the time correct for whatever reason.When I have had people over and they keep hearing the clattering they eventually want to know what the heck that noise is and then they watch it for a little bit but other than that, it isn't worth more that about 10 bucks."
2,I Love America: The Memoirs of Command Sergeant Major Tadeusz,"This was basically and ""I love me book."" Almost every 4th page had something about how someone was saying that SGMJ Tadeusz was the best they had ever seen. His combat expeience was basically ""I went to Viet Nam, I came home from Viet Nam."" Very little substance as to what happened, which leads me to believe that SGMJ Tadeusz was pretty much of a politician.I listened to him talk about his experiences at a meeting of the Military Officers of America, and he spoke about 5 minutes or less, and didn't describe anything about his combat experience.I believe that he accomplished a lot in his life, but his book was so much of a dissapointment that I gave it away."
1,The most poorly written book I've ever read.,"This book is a major waste of time and money. It is very obviously self-published, no one else would put out something so packed with incomplete thoughts, spelling errors, grammatical problems, or a total lack of new insights or anything of value to add to what's already been written. I'm sure Mr. Nelson has a point (or two), but after reading his book, I'm still not sure what it is."
4,Nicole Langley's amazing Run Away Home.,My book was about a little girl named Jane. She and her father and her mother lived in a far away place.They were very poor. They couldn't get food everyday at a grocery store .They were workingclass or other words they worked allday for a good day's work.They kept an indian run away boy that was apache .He got swamp fever and Janes mamma had to take good care of him until he got better .Then the sherrif guy came and tookhim away.
1,Not the greatest.,I personally thought this book was not very exciting. I think the author could have done much better. But in some parts of the book I enjoyed it very much.
3,"premise seemed good, however, the execustion was lacking","The premise seemed good, however, the execustion was lacking. The characters just weren't very likable and seemed to talk alot! It did have a good spin on it but...."
3,Slower then his other books,"I found this book to be slower and not as interesting as some of his other books. Both The Good German and Istanbul Passage were faster paced with a better story line and would absolutely recommend those books over this.That said, the author continues to write about flawed characters right after WW 2 and its a genre I love. Think Alan Furst but with more action."
4,Dark and Powerful,"This CD is worth owning for the overture alone-- orchestral music just doesn't get any more dark and ominous than this. The ""Escape from Rura Penthe"" track provides a nice contrast, with a soaring melody that evokes all the heroism associated with the Star Trek mythos. This is a nice example of how music for sci-fi films doesn't have to sound completely foreign and unlistenable."
3,Almost as good...,"This album is much more main stream than thier earlier albums. If you are looking for traditional celtic, you are bound to be disapointed. While Mari Mac, I'se the b'y and Old Black Rum are great drinking songs from their past CD's, there is nothing on this CD that conjures up that image of living on sea with a bottle and an image of girl in your mind. I miss that but still like music they are producing. Great Big Sea now has the sound of a band trying to make it in America. I hope that changes. Nothing connects for me like the scolding wife or Rant and Roar where I want to have a drink and sing along. Given all this, their latest effort is still worth buying. When I am King and Lucky Me make the album worth getting on their own. Sally Ann is a good effort also. If you are just learning of Great Big Sea though, you might more appreciate one of their earlier albums."
3,Not up to par,"This album is simply not their best work. I am enjoying a song here and there, but it is such a departure from their previous albums and the songs that made me just want to get up and dance! I'll continue to listen, but overall I'm pretty disappointed."
3,Great Big C+,"First off I love the band, probably top or near top of my current favorites.That being said I can also admit when their material is weaker than usual. I tend to prefer the rousing Celtic party numbers (Lukey, Scolding Wife, Night That Paddy Murphy Died, Meri-Mac, I'se The B'y) to their more pop oriented material. As a result I was bound to be disappointed by the record.There's some fine moments of pop material in their history (especially the ""Turn"" record). While I've only had this a few weeks it doesn't feel as if this will be on that level. Still it's enjoyable music particularly ""Drum"", ""When I was King"". I just hope the next disc is a bit more filled with old Irish fun!"
2,A Great Big Disaster,"I used to like Great Big Sea back in the days of the Play and Up (both of those albums are great, buy them instead), but ""Something Beautiful"" was just plain terrible. The first five songs are OK, only ""Helmethead"" and ""Beat the Drum"" are good, and the rest is awful, including the two traditional songs. Everything Sean McCann sings on this album is unlistenable.The band didn't sell out, they bought in. This was produced by the same guy as the Barenaked Ladies, and guess what? Great Big Sea sounds just like them on half of the songs. The whole album is completely overproduced and most of it sounds like something you would hear on Lite Radio. There is almost no energy here, except for a few brief moments.Overall, I was very disappointed with ""Something Beautiful"" and I thought that after the mediocre, but still enjoyable ""Sea of No Cares"" they could do better. I hate to say it but, Great Big Sea is finished. The tide has pulled out."
4,Great Hitch,"I haven't had any problems with this hitch on my 2008 Honda Odyssey. The only concern is that it tends to reduce your rear-end ground clearance over steep bumps/hills. I tow a 3,500lb 22' Catalina sailboat no problem. Great price for a great product."
4,Perfect fit and easy install,"Bought this online, but called them first to answer questions. In one of the descriptions it says hidden or invisible or somethng like that, and I wanted to understand what that means. It doesn't mean anything, nothing is hidden, but besides that point, this was great.1. Delivered on time in protective packaging that prevented any scratches.2. It actually installed easier than the directions, I didn't have to loosen the tailpipe(there actually wasn't a way to loosen it anyway on my vehicle) as it says, just slide the hitch over the top of the tailpipe from the back.3. It looks good installed."
2,"Great idea, inferior parts",This was purchased when we moved into our new home. Great idea. Unfortunately I too had a problem with the plastic holder and the rubber gasket breaking.I fashioned a new gasket with a rubber band and that worked for a while beforethe plastic holder shattered....The company would probably make some money andsatisfy customers if they would just sell replacement parts at a reasonable cost.
1,Poorly made,"At first this organizer worked brilliantly in the garage for our garden tools. But after a year the plastic holders started to break as though they had been programmed to do so. We don't live in a cold climate--it never freezes in San Francisco--so my conclusion is that they've made this out of cheap plastic. Unless you are using this to only hold umbrellas and a light broom, you'll do better with plain old hooks."
5,one of my all-time favorites,"I love this album from start to finish. It has all the great elements of blues-based rock & roll.... great back beat, horns, harmonica, strong guitar, & great hard-drivin' vocals. The lyrics are well though out and not just thrown in as an after-thought. I have 4 kids (15-5), they love it too. I have used this album to teach them what good rock is supposed to sound like. It is tough these days, (a lot of crap out there)...we play it everytime we cross the Walt Whitman Bridge and head to the shore. If you like Southside, I would think you already own this...if you never heard Southside before, it is a great intro to an underappreacited band that had held on to its roots. The best of the Garden State."
5,Marco's music,"Marco's music is truly angelic. His truth, his feelings, and his love all appear with every word he writes and sings. If one were to listen close enough one could almost feel his heart with each note he plays. Marco has been blessed with a gift from the highest power, and to be able to listen to his music, is truly an blessing. I can't seem to thank you enough Marco for sharing your music with the world."
1,Wish I would have sent this back,"I never checked this out until quite some time after receiving it, and I am so disappointed. I don't understand the rave reviews I read. I wanted to listen to this, and watch, as I fell asleep at night. I expected this to have more photos and action, maybe some soft background music. The voices are not great. I doubt I will ever open it again. I'd rather get my Bible and read than listen to this thing.I would NOT recommend this item even slightly."
2,A powerful process?,"First and foremost, I did a terrible job of researching this book.Even though I am not involved with B2B sales, I thought I might be able to utilize and translate his ""powerful process"".Mr. Cherry states in his book ""If you learn how to ask good questions, you can automatically set yourself apart from yourcompetition"". Really!? When you feel like you wasted your money, you perpetrated the greatest fear we all have, THE FEAR OFFAILURE. This is an example of why buying books on line can be tricky. If I had an opportunity to peruse the book further, Iwould not have purchased it. It's not that the target audience is B2B, it just lacks additional insights from the basicintroductory sales books. Save your money. This book was assigned a 5 star rating. I made a mistake."
2,Disappointing -- Only for Business to Business Selling,"After reading such rave reviews on amazon about this book, I decided to order it. Upon completion of the book moments ago, I'm greatly disappointed. This book is 100% geared towards Business to Business selling, and 98% of the references and examples in the book are geared towards selling to a Company. I'm in direct sales, selling to regular people, and I found the majority of this book completely useless. There were a couple of decent tidbits that I took to heart, but the majority of the book, like I said, was useless for me. Only look into this book if you're in B to B sales."
3,Use only as a compliment to an established sales process,"The book has some great questions, and some poor ones. It helped me understand better the 'conversation' of selling. I should now sound less like a robot thanks to this book.However!!! If you don't already have an effective sales process this book will do _nothing_ for you. For new sellers without a process, I can't recommend strongly enough both ""Question Based Selling"" by Freese and ""SPIN Selling"" by Rackham."
5,Sweet and Beautiful,"Alecia Nugent is one of the attractive voices heard on bluegrass radio stations. Her style of singing; depth of soul, and refreshing voices adds strength to her songs of love and lost love. Her youth appearance makes her very appealing to a large number of younger listeners. I'll Stay Around, Think of What You've done, and You don't Have to Go Home, are some of the finest songs of this audio CD. Musical support from another young talent Rhonda Vincent and Lynn Howard makes the recordings even more enjoyable. If you are new to bluegrass music and one who is interested to listen to bluegrass you must check this CD out."
5,Why aren't more people reading this book?,"Staggerford is one of the best novels I've ever read, but I'd never heard of it when I picked it up in a bookstore a few years ago. Hassler's writing is deceptively simple; if you want a flashy novel with car chases, guns, and sex, this is not for you. I think it's been miscategorized as a ""cozy read"" because two of the main characters are unmarried teachers living in an old house in a small town, but the stories being told here are complex. This book is funny, honest, and incredibly sad. It's written with a quiet understanding and compassion for its characters that I've never encountered before. A book like this is what makes people want to write."
4,Compelling conclusion,"Although not as unique as The Sparrow, The Children of God does a fine job of answering many of the unanswered questions left at the end of the first book. I enjoyed reading about the changes that occurred on Rakhat, which were initiated, unintentionally, by the crew from the first book. When a pebble is thrown into a pond, who knows what the outcome may be?"
2,Fun but dissatisfying,"My major concern is how un-Jesuitlike these Jesuits are. They don't appear to be interested in the aliens' beliefs, even when, in this sequel, we explicitly see the aliens refer to gods. Though appearing to address bigger issues, I thought this book was very wrapped up in Sandoz's individual experiences; this could have occurred in a larger context of the meaning for human religion and culture as reflected by the religion and culture of another race, but it didn't happen. Therefore, Sandoz continues to present himself as a self-pitying solopsist who is individually angry at having been ill-used, or at the least, misunderstood by aliens. Opportunities to draw this out on a more profound scale abound, and are not enacted."
2,"Bad, But Better Than Her First","I thought this was a very poorly written and poorly edited book. I do think, however, that it was better than her first in that she used point of view slightly more skillfully, though this is still not her strong point. The plot was also slightly more coherent. Just for the record, I thought celibate was used in the wrong way, too. You can't judge by dictionary definitions the way the previous reviewer does. You have to read the context in which Russell uses the word. She's okay, but I didn't find any great religious or philosophical issues in either book."
4,Someone thinks sci-fi fans won't like this one either,"Someone thinks that this is as good a book as The Sparrow with the same strengths and weaknesses. Cardboard characters but interesting theological dilemmas. Someone also thinks that the people who will like this book are the catholic intellectuals. It will not satisfy science fiction fans, that's for sure. Someone also thinks that the Ms. Russel's characters spend too much time thinking about faith and not enough feeling it."
1,Not Free SF Reader,"Unfortunately, this is even worse than the first book, The Sparrow. To be avoided. Insert review of The Sparrow here, as exactly the same applies :-A bad book by a mundane religiously focused writer trying to be a science fiction writer, and failing, in general. Obvious, tedious, and worse than mediocre. This sort of thing has been handled many times before to considerably better effect. The religious preaching is so overt it causes you to grit your teeth and groan."
4,A Buki without his Bukis,"The name has changed but there's not much change in the music. Marco Antonio Solis may as well still be heading up Los Bukis in this album, but that's not necessarily bad. The album is mostly balads and boleros. He does a nice tribute to his Mexican state in ""Pirekua michoacana."" Anyone who has not seen or heard him live will be surprised at what a low voice the man has as he narrates part of ""Mi ultimo adios."" If you like Los Bukis, you'll like this. If ""Trozos de mi alma"" is more your style, you'll find that this album comes up a little short."
5,Great way to introduce your child to languages,"Guten MorgenBoker tovBuenos diasSab'a alkairDobroye utroShubh probhaatdzau anSawubonaOhayo gozaimasuBuon giornoBonjourBom diaor ""Good Morning."" Twelve ways to say good morning from German to Arabic to Zulu to French this book introduces children to other children and how they greet, ask how are you, what's your name, and say common words like no, please, thank you and more!The back of the book contains a map with colored symbols as to where each language is spoken. This is a great book to introduce your child to other languages and cultures. The illustrations are well done and the prose is such that you can take it as far as you'd like in terms of helping a child understand other cultures.For young children, this would be an excellent book if you are planning a trip away from the United States."
2,"You heard one, you heard them all.","Don't get me wrong, this is a good band, talented musicians.I think they're trying too hard to sound ""classic-rock"".Every song on this album sounds exactly the same.You heard one, you heard them all.I got rid of it the next day."
4,Nice departure from most of the EMO crap that comes out anymore.,"It may not be a new sound, but it is definitely a glorious departure from most of the whiney, emotional crap that floods most mainstream rock outlets. If you are a fan of Zeppelin, or a plethera of other 70's bands, or good rock music in general, you will find someting worth your money on this release. And by the way, reviewer XYZ, WOLFMOTHER is from Austrailia, not Europe. They are two completely different CONTINENTS. Look at a GLOBE once in a while and spare others of your ignorance. ""If this is the next wave of European Metal, then I think it's safe to say that music is dead on that continent.""- Reviewer XYZ"
2,Rip-off's die hard,"The blatant stealing of riff's and musical ideas doen't equate to a band's usage of ""influences"".Wolfmother, in the marketing vein of Everything Old Is New Again, have crafted an album so full of five-fingered lifted riffs that it's hard not to draw the obvious conclusion that this band has no ideas of its own.Another band, called Kingdom Come tried being Zep. clones. Where are they now?"
2,Guilty Pleasure of sorts,"This album is a guilty pleasure - of sorts. Wolfmother unabashedly rips of 70s rock with a lick here and there from Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Iron Butterfly, etc... While it is nice to hear someone run a Fender Rhodes and an Organ through Marshals again the horrid lyrics full of 30 year old clichés kills the album. ""Rainbows tinted with gold"", ""said the joker is a wanted man / makes his way across the land / see him sifting through the sands / said I'd tell you all a story about the joker and the thief in the night""... Come on... While I had no expectation of grand insights or artful poetry, this just stinks."
3,what's the big deal?,"oh, i get it. this is one of those heavy Led Zep, Black Sab influenced bands that indie listeners can talk about. no better than The Datsuns, and they sound too much like the White Stripes. i'm not saying they're bad, but five stars? please..."
1,Not really impressed,"I don't know what happened here. I read a few reviews stating how Wolfmother was the greatest thing since Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, etc. I don't see any real similarities between them and WM. The songs are so-so at best. Lyrics are silly at times, musicianship is lacking. Just not a whole lot to get excited about."
4,Fun for a compact traveling dart board,"Took this on some trips with the fam to replace ""bored""-games. I used some neodymium hooks to hang it from metal air registers on the wall so no holes were made(which also puts the bulls-eye pretty close to 5'8). I ordered an extra set of darts from eBay and after playing more than 30 games with 2-4 people per game it is still holding up well. I did put some padded tape on the rear of the plastic end caps of the pvc pipe to dampen the taps against the wall when the dart hits the board. Also in case anyone was wondering the actual diameter of the board is right around 11-1/4"". Nonetheless, it is a decent board when used just for fun as the darts stick 90% of the time with little bounce-offs or sliding.Note: this board is only 1 sided with no other games on backside; so you could probably find one here on amazon of comparable price with another game board printed on the back."
3,A guide to learn Quran,"A good Quran Dictionary is the need of the hour as lot of people is interested in learning the Holy Quran. Since Quran's literary beauty is almost totally lost in all translations, studying the Quran in Arabic will help in appreciating its true beauty. If we count the actual number of root words in Quran it comes around 1873 words. I believe that any person interested in learning Quran's word meaning can do it in around 2 years since Quran is really made very simple. I think this book will help the students of the Holy Quran in learning Quran's word meaning."
2,"Get as much from reading ""help"" in th program","Not really very helpful. Take the time and carefully go through ""help"" in the program. That will give you all that you need."
5,i love it,i liked this d.v.d because i grew up with dennis the menace his one of my favorite. i will recommend to anybody.
5,BIBLE LIKE NOTHING BEFORE,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE DVD's THE ONLY THING IS THE NARRIATOR TALKS A LITTLE TOO FAST, BUT IT IS TOTAL ENJOYMENT!"
3,Is this the same recording as the CDs?,"I recently purchased the CD version of this product. I agree with the other reviewers that Scourby did a splendid job and his voice is the best. But as I said in my review of that product, there is just one HUGE problem with this product. The problem is the sound quality of the Old Testament. The New Testament sounds great, wonderful, clear, crisp, and full of vitality; but the Old Testament sounds like Scourby has a bucket over his head, or worse. Every disc of the OT has the same problem and it is deplorable, so much so that I cannot even stand listening to the OT. This is extremely disappointing, to say the least. So I'm wondering if anything was done about the sound quality for the DVD version, although I doubt any significant improvement can be made to the original recordings. Since I don't know how the sound quality of the OT is on this DVD version (although I assume it's the same), I'll rate it at three stars for now."
1,Very Poor Quality,This DVD may well have been an audio tape. The voices are not in sync with the slides so you can't follow it visually.
5,This is Great!,"This is a excellent edition of The King James Verison on DVD! Rather you want to study or just listen to it while your resting, its a wonderful treat and I am glad I have it."
5,Owner Sally Recording Sudios Memphis TN,This is a very good DVD. It is very easy to use and along with the Bible it has some very nice photo presentations. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys The word.
3,Expected more options...,"This is basically a put into DVD player, turn on and play with options only to play entire book, or play entire chapter. I expected it to be able to navigate through chapters with more ease and for it to have more interactive features.For the narration, it gets 5 stars. I purchased because of Alexander Scourby's voice, my parents had the cassette tapes for ages and I always popped one in when I wanted to take a break from reading. His voice made ""reading"" the Bible a lot more interesting."
5,possibly one of Isaac Asimov's greatest books,"Isaac Asimov puts forth the ""Rare Earth hypotheses"" long before Ward and Brownlee's; and, they don't even reference it! The only major issue Ward and Brownlee bring up beyond what Isaac does in ""Extraterrestrial Civilizations"" is the snowball earth hypotheses.I suspect Isaac's book here has gone into the history's dustbin because it say's what most people interested in E.T's don't want to hear; there's not that many out there!"
5,Breathtaking analysis of possible technological alien life.,"This book is one of the earliest books to fully address this subject.Unfortunately, it so hard to get, I personally asked Dr. Asimov, (before he died) if even HE knew where I could get another copy of it and he did not. In fact he autographed my hard-cover copy. I'll sell my copy, but the price will be high."
3,Interesting but not pretty,"I adore perfume and own literally hundreds of bottles, so my taste ranges pretty widely, but this is one that I would never wear. I can admire the structure, but to me it smells exactly like a healthy, well-maintained compost heap. Not something I would wear to dinner."
1,SUB,I WAS LOOKING FOR A DIFFERENT KING OF SWEETENER FOR MY TEA AND CAME ACROSS THIS AND DECIDED TO TRY IT OUT WELL IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY IT WAS PRETTY MUCH JUST LIKE BROWN SUGAR AND I THINK I SENT IT BACK
4,colour atlas of common oral diseases,"The book is very good, it will help you develop excellent idea about clinical oral diseases and their treatment, I highly recommend it for dental student, oral pathologist, and oral medicine ."
5,Great Hawaiian music and hula music,"I also originally had the vinyl albums, which I taped so I could preserve the vinyls as long as possible. The music is clear, and the musicians are now considered amoung the great Hawaiian musicians. Benny Kalama and Charles sing a duet in falsetto that is incomparable. Sonny Kamahele, Barney Isaacs . . . a dream combination. The two albums are the perfect way to learn classic hulas starting from easy to hard. I learned to hula using the basic lovely hula hands. I highly recommend this for hula teachers, and those who just plain enjoy great hawaiian music."
1,Borrow From The Library..It's Too Pricy for What You Get,"Well, this was an anti climatic book. But maybe it was supposed to be? I found the ending dull and rushed.Lizzie did something bad....or did she? Well, rumors start to fly and then there is a murder...and then everyone goes to Paris. We read about Mary's, Geoffrey's and Iris' adventures in Paris..although there wasn't much to write about their adventures because this is a novella and we don't get a lot of detail. Anyway, I'm waiting and waiting to find out about the dead guy and about Lizzie's evil secret and when it comes I'm like......that's it?I found the characters flat and dull and not very exciting at all. Thankfully it only took me 2 days to read this book. If it had been longer and I invested more time into it I would have been annoyed. To be honest I'm not sure if I want to read anymore of Ms. Ephron's novels."
4,A Great Sunday Read...,"I read Ms. Ephron's 'A Cup of Tea' and really enjoyed it, and I wasn't disappointed with 'One Sunday Morning'. It did seem to go a bit slower than 'Cup of Tea'...but it was a good read nonetheless.This book only took me a couple hours to get through, and held my attention the entire time. Granted you don't find out the meaning of everything until literally the last two pages, but your need to know keeps you turning them.I can't say the character's were very well developed, or that the story had much meat to it, but keep in mind...it's a tiny little book that's more for passing the time then challenging the mind.Overall I definitely recommend this if your looking for a light, quick read on a nice day, or if your in between books, and are looking for a filler. Ms. Epheron sure knows how to tell a good short story, and I'll absolutely be keeping an eye out for her future work."
2,WHO CARES? NOT MY TYPE OF BOOK,"It is a quick read about some pretentious females during the time of Prohibition in Manhattan. Not nearly as good as her other book ""A Cup of Tea"". The women in this book are so concerned about appearances. After about 100 pages into the book, my response was ""who cares?"""
2,A and E strings don't sing well......,"The G and D strings are OK. But the A and E strings are depressed in volume, especially the E string which makes unbearable squeaky sound. Very puzzled as what is really wrong."
5,Perfect Garmin GPS system,"[..]This particular GPS is so easy to use, and follow. The one aspect I appreciate is instead of the 200 series, of saying i.e. ""turn left in 300 feet"" it actually says the street by name, thus avoids any chance of confusion. Plus the screen is more graphic than the 200 series.The voice is also more human like, as my 11 year old son says ""she is nice"" lol.Great value-great price-great unit."
3,It's not an AVIC-N2,"I bought this item to replace my Pioneer AVIC-N2 that was stolen because I didn't want to get another in-dash unit that could be taken again. The 650 will usually get you there, or at least in the general vicinity. It just doesn't compare to the Pioneer I had, but it didn't cost nearly as much either."
4,Good product,"Nice Product, had some issues with the vehicle mount but every things great. Good satellite signal in the Boston Area. Im currently on an internship and want to explore without getting lost, this is a great temporary and permanent solution to my traveling needs. Whether its finding a local store or traveling a few hundred miles it get you there easy. Detour feature has saved me a few times with high way accidents and slow traffic. Many great features and the ability to add on."
2,What Nuvi lacks,"I bought this over the thanksgiving holiday. Now that I'm using it, I'm surprise that Garmin sell this unit in CA with a windshield mount - when windshield mount is not legal in CA. I also notice that the device lack an audio jack, and want people to listen through the NUVI back speaker. The worse thing is that sometimes while the unit is playing MP3 files and you navigate the menu, the system lock-up and require a reset of some sort.The next bad thing - no battery replacement so after 3 years, the internal LiIon battery is going to be dead !!!!For GPS/Navigation - I wish the road routing would offer non-left turn shortest path routing."
5,Nuvi 650,Excellent GPS unit for the price paid. Great for the average driver. Large visible screen; maps loaded are phenomenal...(how does this little thing know when a road changes names???)Most pleased with ease of use; mounting bracket & hardware and its overall performance. Worth every penny
3,Could be better,"It's ok but has some usability issues. One thing I CAN NOT stand is not having a QWERTY keyboard layout. Also, satellite link time is annoyingly slow. Having to pay for map updates is lame. Speaker could be better."
4,Bisha,Great product but as with most tech it is not perfect. I found one instance where the Garmin direction was to turn right but the intersection only went left. Left was the correct way to go. Once I made the left turn it recalculated and the rest of the trip was fine. Options are also expensive.
4,good product but...,"i've used this just a couple of times. in the city it works great, got me where i needed to go. I went camping this past weekend and it didn't know the campground i went to in the mountains, of course i didn't have a cell phone signal either. so just have a back up map just in case"
3,A few flaws,"We purchased the Garmin 650 and were very pleased with the basic operation right out of the box. However, call me old-fashioned, but I longed for a complete owner's manual instead of a very small booklet with limited information. The only option I had was to go on line and print my own copy. Also, after purchasing the item on-line we decided we would like an ac adapter and a carrying case. We went to four stores in Houston and no one carries accessories. Therefore, we had to go back on-line and have them shipped. It would have been nice to know that we would not be able to get accessories so we could have purchased them when we placed out order."
1,Difficult to Charge,"First, we love having our Garmin Nuvi 650's. The problem is being able to charge these units.We have had two Garmin Nuvi 650's for approximately 23 months--less than two years! The cigarette lighter charger for both units broke. And many times, these cigarette lighter chargers did not work even though we replaced fuses.For over a year, we have had to charge these units with the USB plug to the computer. Now, these units will not charge using this method.We will need to replace these Garmin Nuvi 650's, but we definitely will not be purchasing another Garmin. These products are entirely too expensive to last less than two years."
3,not as good as i thought,"When i got my package, it did not come with an instruction manual like other gps (the non commercial one that I have did come with a manual), all accesories were wrapped up in individual, clear packages which made me think that it was refurnished. Anyway, I try to install the Cantones software language, but the gps did not allow me to install it. When i was ready to return it to the seller, i discovered that i had to pay about $45.00 in restocking fee. So that was the only reason that I have decided to keep it."
2,Can't hear you,"Windows down, volume at max 100%....and I cannot make out what the directions are telling me. Had to return it."
5,Great Product,this unit does everything I wanted.Easy to use.Clearn directions.Nice screen.A good choice to buy.
4,Garmin Nuvi 650,"This GPS fit all of our needs ""Almost"" perfectly on our recent trip to Canada and Maine. At one point in Canada, instad of directing us to a shopping market, we ended up in front of 4 garbage cans in a depressed area. So, we named the unit ""Mata"", short for Mata Hari as it had betrayed us. This was really the only time though, and we grew more and more dependent upon it and it's ability to locate all kinds of information for us such as available lodging, fuel etc. It didn't contain ALL lodging possibilities but enough to give us a good idea as to whether or not we would be able to stay someplace. We enabled the chime to sound when a turn was upon us and we enjoyed having ""Mata"" mention street names and distances. I would definitely recommend this unit."
5,Real World Micro,This book is great for a micro class. I am a college student and I really loved the book!! The material was very enjoyable to read.
5,Well worth a listen,"I've had this live recording from Tokyo for years, and it is my first recording of this wonderful piece. The first movement is wonderful--well played and interpreted the whole way through, and the second movement displays plenty of the sarcastic attitude and all out playing that give it an edge. The largo is sublime, though. Bernstein and the orchestra pull out every nuance of beauty from the movement. The finale is excellent as well--pinnacle of Bernstein and the NY Philharmonic's collaboration. The brass and timpani especially shine.This may not be the definitive version of this piece for all time (I'm not enough of an audiophile to say for sure), but it is highly satisfying, and the excitement of the live performance really adds something."
5,"Great game, decent graphics","Neverwinter Nights is a well thought-out game that is full of plot twists, side quests, and customizable characters. This is a great game that gives you many hours of enjoyment. It may get tedious to some players out there, however.So if you are looking for a great game that runs on even older computers, this is the game for you."
3,neverwinter rules,Great game. I bought this game so I could get on the internet and play online. 3-n-1 a good price for three fun games.
3,Read the book in its entirety,"Yes, as many reviewers have noted there are a few factual errors and some interpretative mistakes. But the purpose of the book was to explain the science of musical sounds and it does that rather well. It manages to hit most the bases - pitch, frequency, perception, harmony, volume, beat, etc. The best chapter was on sound reproduction, the worst on modern (quote unquote) music - particularly computer-generated ""music"" that reminds one of elementary school compositions.I am reminded of the few times the Symphony has attempted a contemporary composition. Everyone stares as the conductor launches into a 15 minute explanation as to what the music is supposed to ""represent"". Sorry, but something's off when you have to explain what you are playing. Illustrations, photographs, charts and graphs accompany the text and an appendix is included."
2,i dropped the class,"I no longer have this book, so I can't comment on the details, but it was the main text of a class that I took at UC Santa Barbara. I was very excited about the class, which was an amalgamation of two of my favorite disciplines: music and physics. Well, the class and the text were both disappointing, and I dropped the class. What I remember of the book is that it seemed rather dull, and it tended towards older ways of thinking about music, particularly in regards to the psychology of pitch (consonance = happy! dissonance = disturbed!). It did not seem like a real scholarly work to me. And I have to agree with a previous reviewer that the computer music section was totally out-of-date."
2,Not my favorite headphones,"I have to confess right now, I'm not an audoiaphobe (or whatever it's called). I just wanted relatively inexpensive headphones to plug into my hard drive so I can listen to music while I'm at work (and block out all the annoying noise around me). I had the Sony headphones which were similar to the JVC but I ran the ear bud over with my chair and crushed it. So I thought I'd get something similar but a little cheaper. I wish I had bought the Sony again. These are ok, but everytime I move my head, I get static. So unless I'm sitting very still, the sound quality is not that great. Of course, when I am sitting still, they're fine and get the job done, but that pesky static every time I turn my head or move is very annoying. I won't buy these again."
5,Great service...,"The PST 3 Cymbal Ride was a gift for my grandson...I know nothing about them But he is completely satisfied with it Myself, I was happy with the quick shipping...."
3,functional but gaudy,"This ball is red (description says silver -- conflicts with the picture), and comes with a large obnoxious logo on the side."
5,Better Than I Thought!! Fun For All!,"If You Love Jesus Christ and The Living Word, Get this! it's not perfect....but it's not filled with flaws either! more entertaining than you might think, and the kids just love it!!"
3,Not enthused,Kinda disappointed in the game. Not as much fun as the original monopoly. The oldest daughter likes the fact that you go bankrupt. And you can learn a lot about the Bible. Otherwise not too good.
3,"works well , but pricey","The plastic siding hooks work well as advertised. Great for light loads. They are a bit pricey, at over a dollar apiece for a few grams of molded plastic. Metal ones are sold for heavier loads, but you can make your ow from scrap sheet metal."
2,syrupy tearjerker,"This was virtually the first gay romantic novel, and it is no wonder it was a blockbuster in 1974. However, taken as a literary effort and not a historical event this book is the equivalent of a Harlequin Romance for gay men. It is a syrupy tearjerker. The author's The Fancy Dancer is a better work, though still solidly of the mush and gush genre.For the het-wannabes among gay men this book would be a must-read."
1,A farce. Pure tripe. Better authors than this for gay men.,"I first read this in 1979 - remember it clearly. It was 20 years old, just came out and thought, Wow, a gay novel. I was so impressed with myself because it was the first gay novel I read. Then recently (29 years later), I came across it in an old box of books of mine, thumbed through the book and THEN I thought, What the heck was I thinking? The plot just doesn't seem believable. It is an interesting look into the gay culture of the 70's - if a bit overly dressed up.Anyway, who is a woman to write about a gay men? Especially THIS woman. That would be like me trying to write about women's fashion trends for In-Style Magazine. Just wouldn't work. After my partner reads this, it's heading trashward.Oh, if you want to be equally ""impressed"" with Ms. Warren's works, try reading ""The Fancy Dancer"", like I did after reading this farce. You'll be as unimpressed as I was - even WORSE."
3,McFadd,I got the cd in no time at all! Too bad he didn't do any more solo albums; it sounds like he was begining to hit his stride!
3,Where are the men?,"This book was used as a textbook for a sociology of family class.One interesting observation is that there is an odd absence of studies and articles concerning men. I am not sure if this is because of the body of research out there or because this particular author chose to disregard those studies. Overall, nice balance of pro- and anti-traditional family input."
5,The Best!!!,"This is the best hunting game you can buy.Everything is outstanding.To play Online is fun and there is alot of people.I give this game 10/10.If you like hunting games you will love this one.Hey its me josh, i never let you down."
3,Good but not great.,"This is the first Maigret novel I read. It was a good read more or less. Sometimes, the narrative is too descriptive. It did not capture me as much as good Agatha Christie novels did. It's a good book to read on a plane or a train, but if we compare it to such books as ""Five Little Pigs"" by Christie, it does not come close in terms of suspense and how surprising the end is. The ending here was somewhat unexpected. But I was not impressed. So, to review, good book to get familiar with Simenon's writing style and his famous detective."
3,One of the best books i have ever read.,It helps you in many ways to seattle in a foreing country. It is the best way to get updated information before you decide to travel.
2,Not exactly... what it implies.,"You'd think that a ""battery powered hub"" would act like a powered hub when you switch the battery on... you know, like you plugged it in. Powered hubs just ""work"" when you give them juice, and can be used to, say, charge your phone, PDA, iPod, etc., anything that needs 5 volts but not necessarily a computer on the other end.Well, that's where this thing fails. Unplug it, and it simply won't switch on if the computer isn't attached. There is simply no logical way to make the USB hub power on without being attached to a computer. Well, I've never had a USB device give me a ""power"" error, so what the heck good is this hub anyway!I'm working on a way to modify the circuitry of this device to trick it into thinking it's getting 5v from the computer when the switch is on... but not interfering with the normal operation. I don't know if it's possible, but I'll sure try... I bought two of these darn things thinking they'd work for that purpose!"
4,"Clint Walker,kinda like Fort Dobbs.","Never seen this before and i am a devoted Clint Walker fan.I was probably under one of those desert rocks seen in the movie,all these years,Good Movie.Good Cast,found Roger Moore Annoying His Accent and Singing.When you look at these actors you think to yourself,hey,i know him,Vitto Scotti and Robert Middleton.Excellent Video Clarity and Sound,again got it through WB.If you like this movie then you will also like Fort Dobbs,a classic.Look at the Dust Fly In Those Mountains."
4,If you like Cheyenne,I am a fan of Clint Walker in almost anything. This movie is very typical of his work in the Cheyenne TV series. A good Western type movie
1,Way too expensive at $400. Google before buy.,"If you google for Magellan Maestro 4040, in one minute you can find Maestro 4040 for around $150. By selling this unit for $400 Amazon is damaging her reputation. Sometimes Amazon sucks, so google before buy."
3,good,I wish they can update the map database. TI do not like the text to speech why can it say like for example right on williams road or left on stewart street.I'll like an option like other manufactural to download updated map for freeThanksManna
2,NO updates available,I really like magellan GPS units - bought a tom tom but wanted to go back to magellan but after buying this one found out there are no updates for this unit and it is outdated by a couple years and when I travel a lot i need the latest updates on roads. suggest buying a model with updated files.
2,Greatly Disappointed,"When I received the Magellan Maestro 4040, the cradle was faulty and wouldn't hold the gps. I finally reached Magellan and they sent me a new one. I installed the cradle in my car, and plugged in the automobile adaptor. It immediately fell out. The contact did not fit securely in the gps. I tried to reach Magellan for three days constantly getting the message that my call could not go through. I complained to AAA, who endorses this product, and they were also unable to reach Magellan. Finally, in total frustration, I called the company from whom I had bought the extended waranty. They told me to call Amazon. Amazon was very responsive and connected me directly to Magellan who sent me a new car adaptor. I am appalled at the shoddy quality control in shipping this product and its constituent parts. Moreover, the fact that there was no way for me to contact Magellan directly demonstrates a lack of concern for the consumer by Magellan."
3,Very slow map rendering,"It is easy to use. But like one of the reviewers (RA Fellows, April 27) said, the maps rendering/redrawing is very slow compared to other units, such as Tomtom and Mio. It is quite annoying when you have to wait at least a few seconds for the hour glass to go away before you can do anything. Other GPS instantly redraw the map as you zoom in/out. Also, this GPS does not let you zoom in continuously or multiple levels at a time. Basically, you have to zoom in or out 1 level at a time, then wait for the hourglass to go away, then zoom to next level, then wait again, and so on. Takes forever to zoom all the way in or out."
4,Magellan Maestro 4040,"for the price, it's almost perfect ... great looks, wide screen, ease of use, great POIs and the text-to-speech i longed for after 2 Magellans (3.5"" Roadmate and Maestro) now ...the cons: (1)still comes with the old towering suction mount that i put on the dashboard (California does not allow windshield mount)... i still have to cut down the tower to shorten it ... the Maestro 3200's mount is much, much better ... (2) the bluetooth works though my callers tell me the sound is mushy; the real problem is after the bluetooth call, the audio goes dead .... you'll have to turn the unit off and on again (as in rebooting) to reactivate the road guidance audio .... maybe the reason why this unit was returned and refurbished!"
4,Wife will learn,"Bought this for my wife. She is a bit un-educated about electronics. I am using this quit a bit now, my Duaghter is off to a university. It helps alot if you have the adress avaibale for entering the route!I love the way it goes dark at sundown and lightens up when the sun rises! Lets me know when the headlights should go on andf off. heheheGreat details and a must have for new drivers!Only draw-back, newer drivers can get really use to using this device instead of learning the roads! I would suggest this for more experienced drivers myself, but helps a great deal for going to new places.I would highly suggest buying a GPS. If you are on the border, and contemplating getting one - the answer is YES!"
1,Don't waste your money!,The Magellan Maestro 4040 is the third Magellan GPS unit I've purchased. The unit is compact and easy to use. However the database it uses is terrible. Routes given by the 4040 are often 10% longer in time and distance than popular Internet mapping programs. Accuracy is poor also; usually a block difference between the 4040 and the real address. My suggestion is to look at other brands or use Internet mapping.
5,"Love it, love it, love it!!!","I can listen to this cd over and over again. I couldn't wait for it to be released. I shared it with my friends and they love it. Its just inspiring and refreshing to hear the spirit in her voice. Its uplifting to me. I love Alice Smith and would recommend that everyone listens to For Lovers, Dreamers, & Me. Can't wait to see what she does next!"
1,Male-bashing taken lightly,"It saddens me to see male-bashing taken so lightly these days, and also that men allow this to happen.""It's only humor"" they say. ""We didn't mean it"" they say. But pop culture INFLUENCES people, especially people who would get this book.""You're overreacting"" you say. Not really. The obvious feminist who wrote this has one particular entry:Obvious- To a man: Nothingand many more entries that make me positively sick.If you're a man, steer clear. Obviously male-bashing is so accepted universally now, that it's classified as humor. And STILL the feminists say THEY are the ones suffering injustices. How sad it is to be a man. Our lives have been CHEAPENED by feminism."
3,Schematic,"This novel felt like Crombie had created a schema, then moved the players around the board until they fitted her diagram.She has two drownings,asking us to make connections between them, but they don't really have any resonance with each other. She also ends up having the suspects in one room while the detective explains what really happened, a set-up I thought went out in the 50s.Ultimately, it's not a bad mystery, just pretty average, hence the 3 stars."
3,"Works, kinda","This thing will work if the fins aren't too badly bent. Even then it clogs up with the least little debris and then you have to stop, clean it and then try to get it back in the fins. Your probaly better off with a butter knife, which is what I was using to begin with."
1,Doesn't fit any of my AC fins,I have four different-sized window AC units and none of the sizes on the tool fit the fins on any of them. I have no idea if it works or not. It's too much of a hassle to send it back to Amazon. So for me the tool was a waste of money. I wished I had bought this tool from a local store so I could just return it. I guess you live and learn.
1,Poor quality,The white plastic part has way too many irregularities. I was not able to straighten out my AC condenser. It's easier to take a knife and run it down the condenser and straighten out the fins.
1,Stinks,"This tool is destined for the finest garbage pails you can find. It doesn't work, it's flimsy, and I think a rubic's cube is easier to figure out. If anyone knows how to use this thing effectively, I'd like to nominate you for president of the known universe."
2,Not for all airconditioners,"This didn't work for my air conditioner. Before ordering this product, get a ruler and measure how many fins per inch on your unit. This product is designed to straighten them if they're 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 or 15 fins per inch (mine's 20)."
4,Handy tool,This tool arrived in new package and very handy for straightening those bent fins on my air conditioner. Could not find this product in stores.
5,Great Value Price - Shame Kodak did not include with camera,"Good Product. Expands the use of your camera, especially in areas you may visit that would not have the original batter available. I have a Kodak 812 and it charges fine in the docking station."
3,Battery too tight,"Can't believe this. I ordered 2 of the Kodak DLK-8000 Equivalent Li-on Batteries for my Kodak Z812IS. So far the battery is working great and lasting a good amount of time BUT the battery is so tight in the camera I cannot remove it without using a pair of pliers!!At first I thought I had it in wrong but it was the correct insert just super, super tight. I asked my son to look at it and even he could not remove it. Don't know how this will fare if I have to carry pliers around with the camera as you never know when a battery will die on you.Really makes it a problem...thus the lower rating for the product."
1,Even Worse than the Last One,"""The Witches' Kitchen"" is somehow even worse than ""The Soul Thief.""Holland should stay away from ill-conceived fantasy and stick to historical fiction."
5,the best book for beginning,"this is the excellent, the excellent book for a person who have never touched programming, although after reading it you can not design a perfect program, but it provides strong basis for you, this book may be of little help to those who are already familiar with programming"
4,"Excellent for Newbies, but don't expect more!!!!!!","I found this to be a great start for someone who was just familar with the windows enviroment. I found it to be a little disappointing when it came to anything more than the basics though. If you are looking for a book to get your feet wet, then this is the book for you. If you are looking for something with databasing or active-X in mind, get a different book.Christopher WhiteheadP.S. If you are a newbie, I would suggest buying this book first, that's why I gave it the 4 stars.."
2,Only buy if your a dummy,This book teaches you the VERY basic of BASIC. I got almost got zero out of this book. It only teaches you very simple and worthless programs. Only buy if you know zip about programing. The only thing I really liked abot his book are the funny little comics.
1,Junk do not buy poor service...(no service),I bought one of these before IKE...Was great for 2 days... the it quit producing power. almost a month later I am still waiting for it to get fixed. Customer service is horrible. Waited 1.5 hours on hold to speak with someone gave up and left a message. Took 2 weeks to hear from anyone... Sent multiple emails...Auto response use online help... Spend several hours trying to locate an Authorized service center almost all listed did not work on generators. Once I did find one they are still waiting on parts....Don't buy one unless you really don't need it to work
5,This is a work horse Generator but very Heavy.,Spend some time at the gym before you buy this one. the engineers naild the performance but the weight distribution to carring design was probably thought of by somebodies five year old son. If you are going to use thei genrator please take along an extra pair of strong hands you will need them. Not for a single mom.
2,false advertisement,"I bought this camera for a birthday party and had to go out and buy a battery which the ad said it came with the camera. Red eye reduction did not work , timing was slow and had to wait at least one minute to take the next picture. Buyers beware!! This camera is a ripoff. I had to go buy another one two days later and return this to Target."
5,Excellent children's animation.,"After watching this children's program on television, and finding it intelligent and not condecending, I decided to send it to my granddaughter. I am an artist and I was paricularly fascinated by the animation style. My son has always loved dragons so I thought his little daughter might enjoy watching this story with her Dad. It also gives her some variety from the numerous Japanese anime shows and the newer fad characters. She enjoyed the first Jane and the Dragon CD that I sent and has continued her enjoyment with this second episode."
4,An engaging debut novel,A good read! The author is successful in weaving historical events of the time with her own family's experience for an engaging and intriguing debut novel. The story contains a comfortable blend of history and present-day content which should appeal to all young adult readers.
3,PLEASE GIVE BETTER SPECIFICATIONS,"We are not going to buy these products if you don't publish proper specifications. After bad experiences with opther CD MP3 players, we ALL want toknow more about these devices before plonking down our hard-earned money. What are the specs. on frequency response? What accessories come with it?And MOST importantly, WHAT types of MP3 files will it decode?Can it handle VBR files? Can it handle 320Kbps files? How about 48 and 32 kbps files?"
4,Good creepy Rendell,"I've read many of her books. I found this one fascinating with a protagonist who is gradually revealed to be deeply disturbed, yet much of the book is told from his (unreliable pov). I could not disagree more with the reviewer who found it boring with too much nature. If enclosed spaces and being trapped with no escape while water rises around you freak you out avoid this book. A excellent read full of twists and psychologically damaged characters."
2,Boar Pewter Pendant,"The pendant was no where near as shiny as is displayed in the image posted here on amazon. It appeared in dark gray, and looked cheap with its rounded and blunt edges."
3,its okay,"This game is okay but my 4 year old finds the game to be rather dull. Some games make learning fun, but this game makes learning to be just work(don't get me wrong, I know learning is work)."
1,Disappointing,I liked his band and he seems like an interesting guy but this was frankly a disappointing read. Sarcasm abounds in this NUI Galway adventure. The characters were not at all believable from the very start when they left their native Tipperary. The city of Galway and the university are both very unreal places. This book lacks soul. It maybe had a good idea once but ended up trampling on itself in order to get it finished.
1,Janet Lowe on Benjamin Graham's extra-marital affairs,"This is basically Graham's life story, with a curious emphasis on his alleged ""womanizing"" and macho attitude -- that were quite typical of the era yet seem to fascinate and repel the author no end (whereas I, for one, am totally disinterested).Still, the book would be OK if it was entitled something like ""The Life and Times of Benjamin Graham"".But calling it ""Benjamin Graham on Value Investing"" is in my opinion a misrepresentation.I would say there are less than 10 pages' worth of ""lessons from the dean of Wall Street"", barely skimmed, and scattered all over the book.For readers who are not yet too serious about their investments, this may be a brief and painless introduction to the concept of value investing; but for my money, what little appears here of Graham's thinking was better explained and better organized in every other book by or about Graham that I've read, as well as most general textbooks on personal investment."
2,Not as in the picture,"The item I received in the mail did not look like the picture. The color was white which did not matter but the shape was different and there were no instructions. I have a 4 egg microwave cooking cup which works great. I wanted a single one to have at work. Hopefully, it does the job when I take it to work and thankfully others have written in their review how to use this product."
1,Not As useful As I First Thought,"The product works as advertised but after the intial trial or two, I have not used it... so basically I am saying... save your money.... but hey, it's my fault for buying and not the product's fault.The item shipped right away and arrived early and works as advertised... I just an not using it like I thought I would which is my fault not the company's or the products."
5,perfect hard cooked eggs,"Love, love, love this little egg cooker. Made the best looking yellow center for hard boiled eggs in short order. Did not taste rubbery, easy to do and easy clean up. Am getting another for my Mother for Mother's Day"
1,Description: 'made of die cast zinc'. NOT! flimsy plastic.,"""Description reads 'frame made of die cast zinc'....I received frames made of flimsy plastic.""Same here. I checked the model number to make sure.If Amazon is going to sell this junk directly to their customers,Shouldn't Amazon read the description, and then inspect the product?Or, is it more cost effective to refund and pay shipping both ways?"
4,"Cruiser Accessories 60510 Combo Kit, Black/Clear","The metal rim lays on top of the clear plastic, not over it to protect the edge. Otherwise, it's decent. Large enough to cover a picture license plate I put on the front of the car. Can clearly see the plate through the shield.If you go to the trouble of protecting your license plate, I suggest you get a fastener that can't easily be unscrewed."
2,Did not meet my expectation,did not meet my expectation at all I saw him in person before and was impressed but this dvd is nothing
1,Poor workmanship,I love the watch till I received it. After only having it on for 2 hours it fell off. I checked the clasp and found the pins that held the band together were falling out. Now in order to fix it I would have to send it back to New York and wait another 6 weeks for it to be repaired and sent back. My other option is to take it to a certified shop around me and pay the bill and submit the bill to them and wait for reimbursement. My other option would be to send it back to Amazon (yuk)and get a new one. Either way that sucks. I am unable to enjoy my watch.I am VERY disappointed.
4,good product,A great camcorter for zooming in but some what heavy. Great for shorter trips. However it does not go easy on bateries.
2,Mariella,"I have been using Mariella Burani for many years. It is impossible to get now that the company is going out. I tried this item because it was available, but it doesn't smell anything like the original. The scent doesn't last as long either."
2,Too much humor,I think I'm a humorous person and enjoy a good laugh as much as the next guy. BUT I did'nt buy Photoshop for dummies to get a laugh. What I want in an instruction book is how to do it PERIOD. Maybe there is much information to be learned from this book and maybe I can learn it when I'm done wading through the low grade humor.
5,Superlatives Don't Adequately Describe This Book!,"When I was a teenager, I read all night under the covers using a flashlight. While I don't have to do that anymore, I stayed up very late, into the wee hours of the morning, reading The Orientalist. I know that superlatives get discounted, but still, this was one of the best books I've ever read.My admiration for the author for figuring out that this life was worthy of a great book, is boundless. Yet, Lev was not a great person; in many respects he was a trickster. What struck me here was the sheer inventivness of this man and his ability to bring it off. But the value of the book for me was not only the illumination of the human spirit, but the history of the time in which he lived. In the end, I was touched by his death and the tragedy of his not entirely admirable life. I'm sure that there is a lesson here for me, but I'm not yet exactly sure what it is.I very well might read The Orientalist again."
4,What Kurban said...,"Like getting a whole bunch of history lessons for the price of one. Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, Germany, Russia, Paris, Italy, NY. At each location the intrepid Said set up shop, Reiss provides a brief, informative, and usually entertaining historic primer. I think it was Mark Twain who said you eat avocados for the dressing? Well, I would say that the narrative of the life of Kurban Said is a great vehicle to read about some of the interesting moments of the early 20th century."
4,perfect all in one system,I love this radio it is the perfect size and as everything you could want.
2,NOT user friendly,"The short and sweet: The button positions do not make sense...the overall design is less than user friendly and the radio gets really bad reception no matter what station you listen to. I was warned about buying RCA products, and now I know why. I think I'll listen next time."
1,Looks can be deceiving !,"I purchased this product as a Christmas present and everyone ended up disappointed. Here are my findings. 1. The reception is terrible terrible terrible ! Radio was unable to pick up a clean signal from a variety of major local FM stations. 2. You can barely make out the time on this thing, there is no backlit setting and this makes it almost useless as a clock radio. It's hard to imagine that a product that has so much going for it also has so much working against it. RCA should fire the group responsible for this product making it to market. Very disappointing."
1,Not worth it,"Its nice to have a CD player on your nightstand, but this is not the one to have. It is VERY poorly designed. THe buttons, all 800 of them, are so complicated and small that its very hard to turn this thing off in the morning. The snooze button is impossible to find at 6am and the Open/close door button for the CD player is exactly where most snooze buttons are...directly on top. So instead of hitting snooze you'll most likely open the CD door. Furthermore, the CD player skips. The speakers don't have consistent sound quality. Most times they are really low, sometimes they are regular. And you can't dim the VERY bright backlight which is bright enough to light up a dark room. Don't buy this."
1,"Cool, but problematic.","About 2 weeks after purchase (at Target), it began making a hum, and the volume began fluctuating. Buy functionality, not coolness!"
1,A bad choice,"My main complaint with this cd-player is that after only 6 months, the motorized door started malfunctioning. Once that began happening, it would no longer play cd's. Of course, after so long, I no longer have my receipt, so what's a girl to do? Stick with cheaper player with no motorized door..."
2,Bad reception,I bought this cd player/alarm clock radio for the compact design and playing cds in my infants/computer room... it makes such a loud noise from the cd spinning after only about 5 uses that I had to return it. The radio stations don't come in well and are clearly full of static (a feature I was willing to ignore because I mainly purchased it for the cd player and compact shape). I thought I would be saving space but this unit was a waste of space instead...who said bigger wasn't always better :)
2,Buyer Beware!!,I bought my clock radio not too long ago. Since then the CD player just opens automatically. I'm sleeping and in the middle of the night I hear the CD player opening. I go to close it and fall back asleep and then it OPENS again. I think it's possessed! I also found this product difficult set because of all the small buttons. The faulty CD player was a REAL dissapointment. I'm returning it today!
1,Hum and volume problems,"It looked cool, so I bought it. However, the second week it began to hum intermittently, and the volume fluctuates. I am able to get it to stabilize after several power off/on sequences.DON'T BUY IT!"
1,"Looks great, but looks aren't everything...","I've had this clock radio for about a year. It worked fine for the first 6 months I had it. Then the problems started. The radio reception quality was always fair to poor, but I have yet to have a clock radio that had great radio reception. Anyway, I really purchased this for the CD player function, which does not work anymore. First, the door mechanism broke. I somehow found a way to fix it and it started opening and closing again. Then it randomly wouldn't read discs. Now it won't read any discs at all, no matter how many times I load and re-load the unit.I am very disappointed in this machine. For $70, which is expensive to me for a clock radio, I expected A LOT more. The look and size of it are great but there is little else to back up its attractive design. I should also note that this machine had fairly light use. It was not overused or abused in any way.Lesson: Do not judge a book by its cover!"
2,Seek and you shell find...,"This book will tell you more about the author than about his subject...As someone who lived in the Soviet Union for 22 years, and someone who still visits Russia at least 3 times a year, I have one word for the this book - ""chernucha"" (Russian word for something that is deliberately made to be depressing by concentrating on the negative). The author has spent all this time in Russia, and this is all he found worthy of photographing?!?! I guess some people can only find inspiration in human depravity.If you like photography, you will enjoy it, because the pictures are masterful. But if you are looking for a balanced photojournalistic account, stay far away."
5,just write!,Just the right product (it's nice to be able to review things in detail before purchasing) and fulfills its purpose.
5,COMPLETE Third Season!,"This is the COMPLETE third season of Yu-Gi-Oh, including the Noah story arc, which actually comes before the Return to Battle City episodes that were released in the 5 discs earlier. It's not required, but it explains a lot about who Kaiba is and why he is the way he is. It's most recommended for completists and those interested in the character of Kaiba.**** Spoiler Alerts ****Now if only somebody would release the remainder of Season 4! There, the story was actually cut off in the middle of the storyline and we never learn how Yugi won through, how little Yugi's soul was rescued or whather Mai was rescued from herself. Well, we can always hope for it someday..."
5,New Life for Desolate Lives,"In Outcry In The Barrio, Freddie Garcia demonstrates that restoration for destroyed lives is not just a dream, but is tangible and complete. He provides a realization of the profound impacts resulting from childhood associations and experiences in a person's life --leading a person into the dark life of Drugs, Alcohol, Sexual Immorality, Violence, and Hopelessness. Ultimately, the reader will see the hope in his/her own life. No matter how dark a person's past may be, there is One hope for complete restoration --as Freddie's life story demonstrates."
5,Great book from Living Blues co-founder,"Essential reading. One of the top five blues books, unique in the field. This is easily the best analysis of blues lyrics, treating black music as black power (beware pale imitations). To say it lacks feeling is to miss the point by a solid mile."
4,Nice overview,"This is a nice compendium of information on the planting, propagation, harvesting, and use of a wide variety of herbs. Basic gardening is covered for situations including every style from formal gardens to containers on a balcony. Ideas and/or ""recipes"" are provided for some herbal teas, foods, crafts, and beauty treatments. Half the book is taken up by an ""encyclopedia"" of herbs, which, though hardly in depth, covers many species (not just the super familiar ones.) The whole book is appealingly laid out and full of lovely photographs. Quite enjoyable."
1,Save your money,"This book sucks!I can't understand all the good reviews it has received. This book does not show you how to do anything from start to finish. The first half of the book is supposed to be the lecture part with the second half having the programming examples to it.There are no examples or exercises to walk you through completing any reports. The sample code for the book is all in one large project and all reports added to one main screen in a menu bar. I guess it would have made to much sense and been easier for a user to understand, to have a separate project for each chapter like most books.The book is very hard to follow. The sample code are in bits and pieces and doesn't follow along with the book. I learned very little if anything from the book. It was a complete waste and I want my money back!Save your money. Everything in this book can be referenced on the internet for free."
2,Its OK,"At first, I was pleased, and I had the impression I could weld with it if I had to! I use premium butane, and after a couple weeks it quit; I actually need to send it back still.DV"
2,great lighter but design flaw,"I have purchased 6 of these lighters over a period of several years and they are very reliable lighter to use in the wind, but all 6 of them broke after 6 months or or less of use at the hinged opener or the hinged top due to the poor quality plastic used. One would think that for the price or money spent on that the quality and durability would be much better. One of the 6 was replaced by warranty, no on the other 5 even though they were within the warranty period. I use them on the river I fish from a drift boat and work great, but due to repeated breaking and nobody wiling to honor the warranty, I have switched to one similar that I bought for 1/4 the price at a smoke shop and it has lasted 3 years now without a problem. Save your money.Windmill Classic Stormproof Lighter"
5,Forget Amway,"After having read this book I came to this conclusion: Amway has absolutely no reason to exist. It has absolutely no retail value to the consuming public and that is confirmed by the fact that their product sales to the general public are only 3 percent and the rest is self consumed by the distributors themselves. Yep that's right, Amway is an internal consumption company. Along with the fact that most distributors, after expenses make little or no money or in a lot of cases, lose money. This book makes this all too painfully clear. After reading this little masterpiece I believe you will come to that very same conclusion as well. Enjoy!"
5,Tape Pushers and Ticket Scalpers,"""It's just a decision away!"" All distributors have heard this phrase on countless tapes and in functions many times. The Amway Corp. is a business that very few have problems with. But the Amway Motivational Organizations are a totally different animal. ""We don't talk about products, because products move themselves"". No, the real money is in the ""tools"" they sell you, that's why they don't talk about the products! Read this book, before you spend THOUSANDS on tools and functions. This book can save your financial life."
3,So-So,"This cd isn't Mark's best. I really only like 3 songs on the entire cd. Even the man in the moon is crying, something's gonna change her mind, and born to love you. The other songs aren't horrible but they aren't ones that I really want to listen to. Overall, it's an OK cd."
2,Songs of Faith,"This transaction went smoothly and the product was in perfect shape.I DO WISH I HAD KNOWN THIS WAS JUST A TAPING OF A LIVE PROGRAM. I WAS EXPECTING JUST DANIEL'S MUSIC, NOT TALKING AND CLAPPING BETWEEN PIECES."
4,Great little system,"I bought this stereo in December of 2002 and it has been a great purchase. I bought it because it plays both cds and dvds and it has a tapedeck so I can still make mix tapes for my car. :) The sound is great, I really enjoy both the prologic and surround sound. I only wish it did not take so long to switch disks or to open the different disks when you want to change them. I really like the size and look of it too. There are so many other systems out there that look so big and ugly, as if all the speakers had some strange growths on them or something. These speakers are small and simple but still sound great. Overall it is a great system."
1,Failed Ouf Of The Box,"Dead on arrival. Any power, battery or AC, causes the red LED to light constantly. Test button does nothing, probably because the unit is constantly reporting a false alarm condition.There is no excuse for the manufacture to ship a factory defective safety device."
4,The Chris Stevens Album Collection,"That was the basis for Chris being the disc jockey at KBHR radio (he had all the records) and a few of them are spotlighted in this album. I think that David Swartz had a cut or two more than he should have been allowed in this album, while more music from the show should have been featured. Still, it's a pretty good album featuring a very wide range of eclectic music typical of what was played on the show, and for that I enjoyed the collection."
4,Ecclectic Mix,"I bought this years ago and my only complaint is that I'm almost sick of it because I've listened to it a gazillion times. It's a wonderful, mostly feel-good, ecclectic mix. I don't know much about music, but the African song sounds authentic, there's a Cajun/Zydeco sounding song, and another song sounds like you might hear it in a club. (I am not a fan of the show.)"
5,Northern Exposure,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
2,Northern Exposure Music CD,The selection of music on the Northern Exposure CD was good however there weren't very many songs on it. Towards the end of the CD there was a shorter version of three songs. I'd rather have the entire song.
1,DOA,I needed a cheap phone. I got one. Had to return for a refund since it would not power on. Amazon shipped it in a reasonable amount of time and refunded the shipping since GE sucks.
4,'Ol Red,"This story keeps the theme of Goines' work as usual. The main character (Eldorado Red) runs a few numbers houses, but his son Buddy and some of his friends rob them. After that, its clearly on. He doesn't fail to paint a picture the entire time, two scenes stuck out in particular for me. One of a mass of roaches which made my stomach crawl, and one of a fight toward the end with a hitman and a young dude where the latter gets his arm broken. The ending is pretty good too, so from top to bottom, its another solid piece from Donald Goines."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,Beware! This is a 1 page document that merely outlines a book. It is not worth the money spent. I thought that it would be more of a summary and elaborate on each subject.
4,JVC VCR Review,"Not many of us VCR users left out there, but when my old machine died, I bought this JVC. Got a great price and the product is very good. Records video and sound well and is fairly easy to use. I would buy this again."
2,Sharp edges,"I was disappointed in this item. The charms hanging it from it are kind of stamped out of metal and they have very sharp edges, which is uncomfortable on the ankle. It was cute, but just not great quality."
1,Awful! Just awful!,"One of the worst films I've ever seen. A disappointement to the Indie Film community. Horrible monologues, no story line, very little talking and very little symbolism and subtlety to make up for the lack of speaking roles in the film. Get with it and move your audience!!!! This film is silly and boring."
2,spend a few more buck,This backpack had great pockets and my child loved the color. However it only lasted a few months before it ripped at the bottom. I would recommend spending a few more bucks and getting a better quality backpack.
4,good for the price but won't last all year,"I bought this for my first grader. He loves orange and this just so happens to match his shoes too. He's been using it now for about 2 months and it's still ok. But on the bottom I can see light through in some spots it when I hold it up in the light. So while I think it might just last the whole year (maybe) it may not quality. My son doesn't carry a heavy load, but if this were for older kids with a lot of books to lug around, it's definitely not going to last the whole year. But as it is, it's good for a 1st grader."
5,Easy to install,Not only is the Maxtor 60 GB 7200 easy to install but it's also very quiet and fast.
1,Insulting to millions,"This trash is insulting to the millions of people who's lives have been saved by methadone treatment.Some people with the disease of addiction have a harder time with recovery than others, just like ANY OTHER ILLNESS. To focus on those who are not getting good treatment, or are not willing to try to get well would never be tolerated if we were talking about diabetes or hypertension, or epilepsy."
5,THESE PILLS WORKS FAST AND WELL.,"THIS IS A GREAT BRAND TO BUY, WORKS WELL ON ASTHMA. NO SIDE EFFECTS, NO AFTER TASTE, AND THEY DISSOLVE FAST."
2,"Decent, could be better","Its not bad, but in the description it says theres an aqua-leash but there is none in the pack. The ship in the middle also seems a little cheap, the masts seem flimsy. The ship also gets in the way of stirring to aerate the tank. Only a few of my eggs hatched, but that might be because my water temp. was a little cold. I like the idea, but there are better kits out there, so look around before buying this one. The good thing is that it comes with a guarantee so if your eggs don't hatch, you could get more eggs and water purifier for a small shipping and handling fee. Also very fast shipping, mine arrived in two or three days."
2,Not that good,I was expecting more out of the movie but it was a disappointment. The action was not as much as it expected.
2,"Good info, scary perspective","While this book has good information about how to handle various city parenting situations, (dangers of Lead, Taxis... etc), I was stunned how the assumption seems to be that you want to pawn your kids off on the nearest nanny/school/camp ASAP."
1,"Unreliable, but helpful parts dept","I have one of these which failed after light use. There is a little control board, for which I can find no information, that handles the sensors and the power switching. That board has quit doing its job on the one I have. It is awkward to work on and unnecessarily complex in that it could probably be replaced with a couple of switches and do about as well for a much longer time.Recently I called Royal's spare parts dept and found the people there helpful. I ordered a replacement control board (at a price of about $14) but haven't installed it as yet since it is dissimilar from the one that came with the shredder. I'll see how that develops."
1,Big fire hazzard,"I have had this unit for about a year with not too many problems except as mentioned... 10 sheets...NOT!!! I was using this to of all things, shred paper....HMMMM too much I think! I heard a loud pop sound and fire shot right out of the top and singed the hair on my arm and also caught the shredded paper in the bin on fire!!! I had to run it outside and douse it with the hose. BE VERY CAUTIOUS WITH THIS UNIT!!! WOULD NOT AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE....UNLESS YOU HAVE REALLY GOOD HOME INSURANCE AND WANT TO MAKE USE OF IT!"
3,does the job,"have had this shredder for about a year now and it's still chugging along. if it were quieter or was faster, it'd get a better rating. despite these minor considerations, it shreds well. it's also fairly capable at handling the amount of paper it's supposed to. does a good job on cc's and discs.so, despite the non-crucial considerations, i'd recommend it. the basket holds a good amount of waste and is easy to empty. haven't had any problems w/ reversing it if i did put too much in either."
2,ROYAL VF 1000 MX SHREDDER,"AFTER USING THIS SHREDDER FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, IT WILL NOT SHUT OFF AUTOMATICALLY. IT JUST KEEPS RUNNING UNTIL I SHUT IT OFF MANUALLY. IT ALSO JAMS EASILY."
4,some cheese but overall highly entertaining,typical of hk cinema...you got romance comedy and action all wrapped into one...with some cheese on top. the monks in baseball uniforms was a bit much and the gun battle at the beginning was also a bit corny...but the rest of the movie was highly entertaining....chow and the heroine have great chemistry and the little kid was great as well...
4,Works slowly but surely,I've been dying my hair black for years. My natural color is medium brown. With two 20 min applications (second with heat) and skipping the lotion step I acheived a dark chesnut brown. Had a slight reddish tint to it. Did not change my medium brown root color or blonde bangs hilight. My hair looks and feels healthy. Smells bad. Will try another application next week to see if it will go closer to my virgin color.
5,Amazing! Just incredible!,"Whatever you do, do not become introduced to Carina Round by Slow Motion Addict, the vastly inferior radio ready follow up to her debut masterpiece. Her song ""Shoot"" will blow you away with the visceral guitars, ""Into my Blood"" will have you singing along, and her voice will instantly make you swoon. On the same level with PJ Harvey for sure, this is an excellent album that shows there has at least been some good music in the 21st century. Must own."
3,WB's specs are wrong. 2 films are NOT in widescreen format.,"Given the anticipation with which my friends and I awaited this collection, it is infuriating that two of the films - Full Metal Jacket and The Shining - are NOT in widescreen (or letterbox) format, but the much inferior pan-and-scan. Even Clockwork Orange can't truly claim widescreen status, though there is minimal matting (the laserdisc version had the same problem) If this doesn't bother you, the collection is a reasonably good buy, especially at Amazon.com's discount. Even though the DVD transfers are not bad, if format matters to you, you will be annoyed. Warner Bros. should make good on its own pre-release hype and issue the version that Kubrick fans and students really wanted."
4,Good,"This seller is good, very responsible, it would be better if they starting to use another delivery sistem. but it was really good."
3,Where are the rest... ?!?,"Okay, as for the quality of the videos actually in the collection, I have no complaints. The Shining, it has been verified, was originally not widescreen and I can't find a widescreen version of Full Metal Jacket so I'm gonna guess the same is true of it. That's okay. But WHERE, oh ye gods WHERE are Kubrick's movies from before 1962?!? Apparantly MGM has released The Killing, Killer's Kiss, and Paths Of Glory simultaneously but NOT in a set, and Spartacus has been left COMPLETELY out, I can only guess this being because Kubrick hated it. Couldn't we get just a LITTLE more unified before we call something the Stanley Kubrick COLLECTION? Please."
4,ARGH! Great Films - Poor Quality!,"Five Stars for Kubrick - No Stars for Warner Bros.How frustrating! After waiting months for this set to be released and all we get is poor quality transfers and little-to-no supplemental material. I agree with an eariler review - this is a BUDGET package. Wait a few months and you should be able to pick it up for $50 or less!WORST DEFECT: The Making of The ShiningWhile the content is fascinating, the video transfer is wretched. They should have made it a two sided disc! The video quality of The Shining itself leaves much to be desired as well.Oh, well, we should have known it was all just an effort to cash in on Eyes Wide Shut and Kubrick's passing. SHAME ON YOU, Warner Bros.!!!I will never order a DVD in advance - I'll wait for the reviews."
1,RIPPED OFF BY WARNER BROTHERS,"Because ""0"" stars means nothing, ""1"" star means something. And that something is a thing Warner Bros. execs should not be proud of. This set is such a lackluster, rushed disappointment of some of the best films ever to be made. Read every 1 star review and know it to be the TRUTH."
3,Don't be fooled!,"The Stanley Kubrick Colletion is a set of the finest films from a great director. But do not be fooled by the techical information which says ""ASPECT RATIO(S): Widescreen Letterboxed."" Several of the films are NOT widescreen such as the important FULL METAL JACKET and THE SHINNING. Both of these films are still presented in a FULL FRAME 1.33:1 format. So if you are wanting the original theater release format of these two, you still have to keep waiting."
2,"Kubrick Great, DVD Leaves Much to be Desired..","I eagerly anticipated this collection and was dismayed at the comments from other customers. Well, before I buy again, I will read them. I am not hard to please but the quality is either equal or worse than video. Barry Lyndon was grainy and the background in one scene jumped around the screen. Sound quality was lamentable as well. I felt like I was watching an old movie that had been restored to the best condition that technology permitted."
1,Beware...Pan-n-scan!,"True fans of Kubrick will be shocked and horrified by this ""collection"" which includes pan-and-scan versions of three of the films (Strangelove, Shining, and Full Metal Jacket). Since Warner Bros. chose to include only 60% of Kubrick's incredible images, I plan to ask for 40% of my money back."
1,Horrorshow,"Warner Bros. has really shamed themselves by foisting this farce upon the public. If there is one director who deserves five-star treatment, it is Kubrick. I simply refuse to believe the Warner Bros. company line that Kubrick oversaw every detail of these DVDs. And on the very unlikely chance he did, ol' Stan must have really been losing the plot. The quality of the transfers are basically glorified VHS -- I was shocked by the soft, substandard video and dull, tinny mono sound. This is really a Warner's budget line series, and all of the DVDs should be priced as such -- in the $10 to $15 range, not a red cent more. After seeing how such classics as ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Alien"" recently got the pristine DVD treatment they deserved, this is an outrage for film buffs everywhere. We've all been had."
1,Kubrick Would be Ashamed and Enraged at this DVD!,"First, DO NOT buy this DVD set!!! If you want any of these movies, get them individually, even though that will cost more per DVD. (I'm assuming, of course, that the individual DVD releases of these movies do not suffer from the absolutely horrible sound quality that this bargain-basement collection set does.) Not only is the sound quality shamefully terrible, but the volume of the sound output is about one-half that of any other DVD -- don't forget to turn your A/V system's volume back down before you play another DVD or you'll likely wake the dead (Kubrick included, perhaps). Also, the video quality is really not very good (not nearly as poor as the sound quality, though). In short, I gave this one star only because zero stars was not an option. Don't waste your money as I did."
1,Kubrick's Death Exploited!,"I almost cried when I put in Clockwork Orange only to find it recorded mono and with Pan and Scan TV editing. I kept franticly going back to the DVD menu thinking that I must have missed something. Many of the movies suffer this same fault, as well as being recorded down to 1 channel (mono) audio. The truth is you get better performance out of a VHS tape with many of these transfers. Furthermore I was shocked to see actual film scratches in the transfer of The Shining. Someone rushed these titles to DVD to capitalize on our loss of one of the geniuses of modern cinema. Don't buy this - wait for a more respectable edition to be released."
1,Worthless propaganda,"Jenin, Jenin, like its sister movie Gaza Strip is an emotional film, but it is worthless propaganda. Just as the people of Gaza were whiners, so too are the people of Jenin.The people of Jenin blame everyone; from the great Satan, to Israel, to the heretics of the US. But they NEVER take responsibility for themselves.Once the people of Jenin stop whining and take responsibility and accountability for themselves, they will get out of their rut. Until then, the endless cycle they weep about is of their own doing.People of Jenin, stop whining and grow up."
5,Best there is,"There are actually 3 ""Word XP Essentials"": beginning, intermediate, and advanced. Decided against the beginning CD because it only had all the ""basic basics."" I am most satisfied with the other two CDs. The teacher is articulate and easy to understand. Actual Word windows are displayed while she is discussing a particular subject. The lessons are short and when completed assignments are given to allow you to do the task yourself.Each disk has a basic table of contents that allows for easy navigation to the various lectures.I'm a WordPerfect expert in a Word world and bought the software because I was having so many problems getting Word to do what I wanted. This has definitely made it a lot easier."
3,can't find filters for the SV736K,"This product seems to work fine. I like it that way. However, the manual recommends replacing the filter every 3 months. This is frequent and would be expensive. I can't seem to find the exact filter for the SV736K. After searching on line, I called the company. Customer service seemed odd. They insisted on a detailed name and address before they could tell me whether or not they had a filter. It took so long, I didn't hang on. I can't really recommend the product due to bad support."
1,Battery no longer holds a charge after 3 months,"I initially gave this product very good reviews. However after 3 months and 1 week I used the vac and the battery no longer lasts more than 1 minute, and it's no running full power. I DID follow the annoying directions on how to charge the battery - ie 16 hours plugged in then unplug and allow the battery to run down (every time I used it). Useless. I donated it to the salvation army in case someone wants to buy a new battery for it. I replaced it with a corded HEPA hand vac with powered brush: theDirt Devil M0105 Purpose For Pets Hand Vac. I am much happier with the new vacuum."
2,Impossible to find a filter replacement,"I bought this vac for our fireplace and I was very pleased with it... until I tried to purchase a replacement filter for the vacuum. Amazon offers several as ""often bought together"" items, and I have now order two of those. Unfortunately, neither one has fit the vacuum model, and I have had to go through the headache of contacting the seller and sending the units back. Meanwhile, the vacuum isn't usable without the filter. It is totally aggravating that Amazon would list the replacement filters as options when they do not fit at all. I cannot find a replacement that does work, at least not on Amazon."
5,I have mine over a year now...and it works wonderfully...,"i purchased my Shark hand vac after doing some research on handheld cordless vacs. It offered quite a few pros with 15.6V motor, quite a strong vac, and a good size for medium to light vacuuming.I have had it over a year, and it still works great. No issues with charging or the battery. The only downside has been that even though the filter is washable and works well, to find replacement filters has been hard."
4,Wall Hanging Adapter,When you buy the Shark make sure you purchase the wall hanging unit or you will only frustrate yourself. I don't know why it is not included as a part of the standard product or at least mark the box and order form to indicate it is not included.Shipping and handling was more than the adapter. GRRRR!
2,New style Shark han held vacuum,"Plenty of power, but it does not come with, nor is there an optional wand to use while standing up. If it came with a wand, to allow the user to operate it while standing up, it would be better than the earlier models, with less power.BUT, the wand is only 4 inches long, the user has to crawl on hands and knees to use on the floor!Not a buy for older folks."
1,Awefull Battery,This vaccum is powerfull. However the battery life is very short. For the first six months it holds a charge for 5 minutes. Not enought time to do the seats in my car. After a year now a full charge holds only about 30 seconds. And yes I followed the directions very carefully about charging the battery. I used it about every 4 days to pick up cat litter around the box. Now I need to charge whole night after each 30 second use. There are many complaines about the battery. Take those complaines seriously before buying the product.
4,Love the Shark hand vac!,"I ordered this because I have two toddlers, crumbs and cheerios everywhere, and a really heavy Dyson (which is incredible for once a week cleanings but a pain to lug up and down stairs after every meal or snack).The Shark sucks up everything. I can use it for 30 seconds after each meal or snack, and the house actually looks like someone cares about it (if you ignore the rest of the toddler chaos).Really, really powerful for a hand vac. If it starts to lose suction, you know it's time to clean the filter! Clean filter = amazing suction!"
1,Waste of Money,Bought this vacuum on July. We have used it about 5 times since and it now only holds a charge for 3 minutes. It's a complete (COMPLETE) waste of money.
1,The truth is in the trees...,"I'll be honest, I didn't watch it. I was excited because the seasons said they were free for prime members, but when clicking upon them, they require a purchase.1 star, not for the content - which I love - but for the misrepresentation by amazon."
4,Pellet gun ok,"The gun is fine but I don't understand the cheesy sights, a v notch sight wold be a lot better than what they provide."
3,crosman phantom 1200,"Bought this pellet gun for traget shooting in the back yard and the rear sights is bad... and is way, way off!!!! Ended up buying a 3x9x40 scope for it. That solved the problem.. the gun is strong. not for kids.."
5,Wonderful music to the film,"By now most of you have heard the music from Dragon on various TV commercials. Even though it's been used too much, that's still no reason to not pick this CD up. Randy Edelman has created a score that suits the movie perfectly. Perhaps his best work to date (much better than his compositions for The Last of the Mohicans where he was outshined by Trevor Jones). If you loved the film, buy the soundtrack!"
3,Great sound quality but some getting used too.,"These are great, I use them with both my mp3 player and old walkman and the sound quality is excellent. You can get alot of volume out of these without the crackling sound you get from cheaper models. They look great too, there sleek and stylish (I think so anyway). The only bother I had with these is that after a while it hurts the top of my ears, after a few weeks it stopped happening but for a while it was a bit bothersom.The size of the ear pieces is a little big also, so you can;t wear any kind of hat with them but the sound quality is still excellent so I would advise buying these.3 Stars"
4,Well worth the price,"In Singapore headphones can be very expensive, some costing in excess of S$300. The HS500s are fairly good for their price range.-Audio quality was tight and loud. I may not be an audiophile, but I do insist that my music sound as clean as possible. Sound doesn't leak so much.-Comfortable for a few hours, after which your ears start to hurt under the pressure. If you really into comfort, get the Sony MDRs.-Stylish and cool to show off to all your friends.If you're on a budget these are the headphones to get. If you're on a higher standard try something else."
1,Wrong Model Shipped,"I love the HS500 headphones; I've had a pair for over 3 years. I wanted another pair because the foam was falling off. I ordered the exact same pair here, but received the SHS5200 instead. No one notified me that another model was shipped. I could have saved shipping by buying the SHS5200 locally, if that was indeed what I wanted. I am not happy."
1,Extremely dissapointed !,"I just received the earphones and tried it with my i-pod. The sound quality , the design and the overall quality is far below what I had expected. First of all, it does not sit on my neck, it keeps falling down my ears. My old ugly earbuds were much better in terms of sound quality. You dont feel the bass. there is something wrong with this stuff. i may return it soon."
2,I Don't Get It,"I don't understand why this item is so highly rated, whereas similar items are rated as inferior. For starters, these headphones are not comfortable. Wear them for a half-hour and believe me you'll be ready to take them off. The sound quality is about what you would expect for such inexpensive headphones - there is often static and popping, and it isn't coming from the player or the item being played. The only silver lining for me is that these headphones cost less than $9 when I bought them, so I didn't waste too much money. If sound quality and comfort are most important to you, pass these headphones by. If price is the main issue, perhaps they are for you."
1,Wrong item recieved... twice,"I ordered the Philips HS500. I received the Philips SHS5200, which is a MUCH cheaper headphone. I notified Amazon that I received the wrong item. They sent me a replacement which was another set of the SHS5200. I called Amazon customer support and got a refund. Don't order this item unless you want to pay twice as much as for a set of Philips SHS5200."
3,"Bought two pairs, one broke immediately","Bought two pairs, one for me and one for my wife, for gym workouts. Quality of sound is good, and is comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, my wife's pair lost one channel of sound after only 3-4 uses. Mine is still OK though. At this price though, it's tough to beat, and basically disposable. Plan to buy her another pair."
5,Good Product,These work great. Good sound.Cool design.The only problem I had was I had to get a second set...My teenage son took them because they were so much better than the ones that came with his mp3 player.A few months ago now.They are still going strong even with all of the abuse he puts them through.I would highly recommend these.
5,California Dreams Soundtrack,"If you are into heavy meatal, hard rock, rap,etc. this is not a CD for you. But if you like easy listing, with a little fat pace thrown in here and there you will like this."
3,You get what you pay for.,This book was free so you can't beat the price. I shouldn't complain I suppose but I didn't really like this book. Love mythology but this book just doesn't do the topic justice. Spend a little money and get the good stuff.
4,engrossing,"For such a thick book, Rain of Gold moves amazingly fast. The characters are likeable, mostly, and the book presents the story of Mexico, Mexican families, and being a US immigrant from Mexico early in this century. I haven't had a chance to read many books that share this particular story, and this one was refreshing.The author is proud of his family, and it shows. Rain of Gold fell short of making me cry or reconsider how I live, but it was thought-provoking. It's worth a read."
5,I cried. I laughed. I got mad. I got furious. I got happ,"I became so much closer to the whole Mexican culture and my wife's family after I read this book. I went thru every emotion I have in me, and came up with a few I didn't know were there. The way the mother would do anything it took to protect the family and see that they made it. They way the Americans treated them like less than dirt. But the cleaverness of the family to take advantage of whatever they could to succeed and become so respected in their own town and in life in general.Victor is truely a very gifted man."
2,Poor condition,The condition of this book was not up to par with the ones I have previously ordered. The cover had the corner torn off.I enjoyed the book however. We live in the area of Southern California in the local of the last part of the book. That made it really interesting.
5,"Perfect Product, Perfect Delivery",This book was delivered perfectly on time and in perfect condition. It is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
1,Check the DVD before you use it: Mine was BLANK,This is just a little caveat to all you teachers out there. I was planning on showing I'm Still Here this afternoon as a means to introduce the collection of Holocaust diaries: Salvaged Pages. I never thought to make sure the DVD actually works--who does? It turns our my copy of the DVD is completely defective. It won't work on any classroom computer nor any of our DVD players.Must dash--now I need to plan something else!
1,absolutly worthless,this air horn is not much louder than my electric horns were and if it gets wet at all it doesn't work at all untill it dries completly out. don't waist your money on this piece of junk.
1,Bad horn,This item lasted one week then quit working. After installing it worked about 25 times. 20 of which was testing . Don't buy
4,Great horn!,"I just installed this horn on my 2007 Suzuki Boulevard. It sounds great, it's very loud! I only had a few problems. I had to figure out where to stick the relay (you have to use it when installing on a motorcycle). When running the negative wire, the directions said you could hook it to the negative terminal on the battery or hook it to ground. I tried to hook it to the negative terminal first, but my bike wouldn't start. I then just hooked it to ground, and my bike started right up and the horn worked without any problems. Considering the stock horn for my bike was $83.00 to buy a new one, I don't mind the extra effort it took to install :)"
5,Great shoe,I bought these to replace another pair and I have worn them into the ground. They go with everything and are very confortable.
4,"Sweet, funny book - would make a great movie","I purchased this solely from seeing Mr. Zweibel on a talk show reading a short excerpt from it. Having been an SNL fan from its very first episode and only of the creatively inspired times, I knew the book would not disappoint in terms of entertainment. That is was also sentimental and sweet, with a message or two to impart, was a surprise. I'm not sure if this is a universally-enjoyed book, though there's no reason it shouldn't be; I just know that this native Long Island girl who misses Woolworth's and Gertz and the Keith's in Flushing enjoyed it quite a bit. Although I have to correct the author - Paul McCartney wrote 'We Can Work it Out,' not John Lennon."
2,Disappointing,"I was pretty excited to read this book, as there are very few novels that have anything to do with running. The concept of this one was unique, broken up along the mile markers of the new york city marathon, and there are some funny moments, but as far as fiction goes, it's a pretty poor story line. The ending was hugely disappointing to me as it stretched credibility a little too far."
1,The Other Shulman,"I'm about half way through this marathon snore of a book and I'm in more pain than Shulman ever knew. I suppose the writing is adequate, but come on .... clever, nope .... engaging, nope .... some chuickles, maybe after a joint or two. What are all of the great reviews about .... No way .... no way I can finish this jog. What a disappointment. I should get double my money back."
5,The movie The Prince and Me is good,"The Movie ""The Prince And Me"" premiered March 31,2004 and is a good movie.The romantic song with Page and the Prince is good."
3,can someone help me,i want to know which song was playin in th background when she was on the plane goin back...during eddiies speech...actually everybody wants it..if anyone knows it plz helpi think it wasnt the last one
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,This item was WAY to expensive and didn't perform to my expectations. I was going to use it as a back pillow when I sit in my recliner..It would ball up and not work well..Wish I had researched further.
4,Knightfall the Novel,"Knightfall is one of the most popular of the Batman DC comic story lines. It is a 3-part story, in which the reader is forced to deal with the traumatic possibility of no Batman! Also in graphic novel form, the novel of Knightfall is a thriller! A wonderful story embellishing Bruce Wayne's true character."
5,"Keep it moving Anne moving keep it moving anne moving, keep it moving","I love the poem Billy work Peyote. Anne has been friends with some of the great Beats. Anne as a writer seeks always new paradigms. I can learn from Fast Speaking Women: chants and essays. She includes An old European chant I am a stag: of seven tines, I am a flood: across a plain, I am a wind: on a deep lake.I would like to write more but it is now time for me to study the writings of Anne Waldman."
1,too little too much,"This vac needs a hard to find, expensive filter (not carried by the store who sold the unit, oddly). The charge doesn't last long and has diminished over time; the battery no longer charges. Other than that, it's fine...I am now looking into the Black and Decker version. Planned obsolescence lives on."
1,i bought this vac from retailer,"i do like this vacuum, the suck power is also strong, but i won't give it 4 stars, because every time before i use it, it will take 24 hours to recharge it,however it only works for me less than 30 mins."
1,battery does not last,"I looked around a bit before purchasing the Dirt Devil Extreme Power 15.6v hand vac at a local shop. The problems began with wall mounting - for some reason the bracket was designed so the weight of the unit is unsupported. I found the battery to be a fundamental flaw; if I left it on the charger ostensibly decreasing battery life it worked fine for the first few minutes then started to fade. If I only plugged it in when needed, the unit was dead and unavailable when needed. I threw it in the trash after leaving it on the wall a few years with no good use."
2,Dirt Devil Hand Vac,"This is one of the better hand vacs...it has pretty good pick up. It has an attached crevice tool which is nice but you need to be careful when using it so that it does not break off.Update...I wrote the first review when the vac was new. In the long run, the battery does not hold its charge even after sitting on the charger for a few days. So, even though it picked up items, what good is it when the battery has no power and the vac won't work because there is no suction?"
5,Works wonderfully!,"This little gadget sucks up everything!!!! I bought it for my mother as a gift, and everytime I visit her I use it.Some of these little vacs are just awful, but this one really works!"
2,Works just ok.,I have this but I wouldnt' say it does a great job of cleaning up. I had hoped for more. Seems like it gets clogged up easily.
3,dirt devil,"well made, mostly metal, I use it to clean up small areas, was hoping it would have power enough for the car, but not really.I have beams in the house and wanted it to clean them, but as they are in the kitchen and grease goes there, it doesn't do that either."
4,filter,"I use this vac to clean around a litter box. We have 2 cats. I find that I must clean the filter every 3 days due to cat hair, otherwise, the vac loses its sucking power. If you don't have pet hair then I think you will be very happy with this vac. It has strong suction for its small size."
4,Best Handheld Vacuum Yet,"This vacuum performs well. It has good suction, good balance, and is easy to empty/clean. It's the best handheld vacuum that I've ever purchased."
3,Had for 3+ years,"good little thing. expensive filters, but do not need to replace all that often.When the batteries die? You have to THROW IT OUT! NOT replaceable. GRRRRR!"
2,Battery holds only limited charge hence short service life,"Add my experience to the list of complaints over what appears to be a short charging life for the battery (it doesn't appear to be replaceable). This one was purchased in Sep 2010 and gave good household service up to the last month or so. Now it quickly loses power and suction. Tried running it down to no power followed by a 24 hour charge but no change. I had one of these for years that gave good service (approx 5 years) and, on the strength of that, stayed with the same make and model. As it has a 3 year wararnty, I've sent a email through the Dirtdevil site asking for replacement--we shall see."
3,They fit but.....,"I have had these a month and they are not bad. In the picture when you order it, you will notice the holes where you can lock them down from sliding. Not sure why but they don't come that way. Overall not bad though."
2,"Solid case, flimsy kit","The case came on time and intact. That is the only positive thing I have to say. I suppose you get what you pay for; it is rare to find a complete set for such a cheap price, but I assure you, anyone who knows anything about soldering will find the iron and gun better used for roasting marshmellows than actually melting solder. I tried using the iron to desolder a board and promptly ruined it.If you are looking for a cheap set to learn soldering (NOT desoldering - the heat from the iron is too unreliable) this may suffice. Otherwise, grab one from RadioShack or keep shopping."
1,You get what you pay for,"Okay. 1st of all, this product stinks. I know what youre thinking. ""Well I get solder, a gun, an iron, and a bunch of neato knicknacks"". Well, I never write reviews, and my prouduct isnt damaged or defective. The soldering equipment does not heat up and the solder provided isnt enough to worry about. In my opinion, you would be better off buying something else. I spent several hours trying to put together some equipment and due to the lack of heat, it took several hours more than it should have. PLEASE! heed my warning and buy different soldering equipment."
3,aromatherapy so so,I have had other aromatherapy packs before and they stayed warmer for a longer time. Disappointed that I have to reheat more often.
2,Good for the first month but broken wire afterwards,Good sound but very bad quality on the wire - wire broken from one of the headphones after 1 month. Dont buy it.
1,copper wires,"I enjoyed these headphones for about month... then similarly to one of the other reviews on this item (which unfortunately I didnt take the advice of before purchasing!) starting falling apart (mind you with no damage to them on my part), with the copper wires of the headphones coming out of three different areas in the headphones. Now only one headphone works and the one headphone cuts in and out as the copper wires begin to disconnect at the base of the headphones.As a whole, these would have been perfectly great headphones if they didnt fall apart and stop working. But unfortunately that didnt happen so it was a complete waste of money, as I am headed to buy NEW headphones, only one month later. Dont buy these."
5,Muddy waters,"After the Titanic, I've been fascinated by the Lusitania. After buying this movie, I was Very impressed. Now yes it does play like they're saying the British Government intentionally sent the Lusitania to her watery grave, but after looking at the evidence I would have to say it makes since. This movie, or Docu-drama. Doesn't really mess around really, it hits the ground running. And even shows you life not only on the Lusitania, but life on the U-boat. And even lets you see the war through their eyes, not that I would be sympathetic to the Nazis anyways. I highly recommend this movie for your collection."
2,Replacing after 20K and one year,"Back in April 2010, I purchased a set of eight of these for my four-year-old 5.3L truck engine. I had them installed and was off and running. This was at 70K miles.Last week, I noticed my truck running rough. In fact, the CE light came on twice while I was at idle. I just turned 90K miles yesterday.I took it in to my mechanic today. He showed me the codes, which read that two of the cylinders were not firing. Turns out the plugs went bad on two, and had potential failures on three more.I told him to put in OEM plugs."
2,Slow and predictable,"This story was slow and predictable as a thriller. It did have some heart-tugging romantic moments. If you are looking for a book you can not tear yourself away from, keep looking and pass on this one."
5,"A ""Dynamite"" Book","February 17, 2002A book for the utlimate Brenda Lee fan. What a life this terrific lady has had with it's ups and downs or should I say downs and ups. She is always able to bounce back up. I'm sure most fans like myself have thought Brenda has lead a glamorus life all these years and for the most part she has. We don't realize all that goes on in that world we are not a part of. Her book is well written and keeps your attention. Even though I've been a fan of Brenda's for 43 years and an honored to be a friend for about 25, there was lots of things about her life the book enlighten me to.I want give away anything in the book, you will have to read it for yourself, but you will see that there are more reasons than one she is know as ""Little Miss Dynamite""! Brenda Lee, the lady with THE VOICE."
3,Fine,I did not feel that comfortable in using this text for the purpose I had intended it for regarding my bible study.
2,Purchased NEW book and recived USED!!,I purchased this book saying it was in NEW condition and when I recieved it you could clearly tell it is used. It had permanent marker on the outside of the pages and the corners had been rolled.The information in the book is not a must have for the serious bible studier. I would not spend my money on one!
1,Unger's Bible Dictionary (Kindle),"I have the hardcover which is excellent. I just received this on my Kindle online and am very disappointed because you cannot go to a particular word or topic. You can only go to the first letter in the word and then have to go page after page to find the particular word or topic you want. This is very unsatisfactory and defeats the purpose of a dictionary to look up a particular word or topic. The alphabet needs to expand and have the first two letters (aa, ab, ac, ad, etc.). This would cut the search time and would make the online dictionary useful."
4,Not as powerful as previous seasons but still good stuff,"There's definitely some oomph missing from this season, with Tommy being weak and helpless much of the time. Colleen has become completely stupid and annoying. And I miss Jack McGee.However, the Jewish fire chief is wonderful, Tommy's soliloquy about Connor, given while sitting on the edge of a tall building, is excellent; and there are still interesting stories and subplots--enough of them to make it worth watching the show.May I just add that the cover art of Leary on the DVD box set is freaky?"
4,"Entertaining, But Not As Strong as Prior Seasons","I found Rescue Me season 4 to be entertaining. I enjoyed watching it and, like prior seasons, often sat at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next (but only at then end of an episode).However, unlike prior seasons, I found that the story, and to a lesser extent, the acting, was not as strong as prior seasons. I often found seasons 1-3 very compelling, and I could not wait to watch the next show. After several episodes of season 4, I did not mind the break.I wondered how much more crazy stuff could happen to Tommy Gavin. Season four answered that question, not a whole lot."
2,Down that slippery slope,"I loved the first season -- sharp, funny, serious and outlandish all at the same time. The second season was a bit uneven, but still quite well done.Cracks started to appear in the third season. Storylines became uneven, and the plot just lurched from arc to arc. I was hoping that it was just a glitch, and that the 4th season would put things back on the right track.Well, the train went off the rails. Season 4 was a huge disappointment. Edgy comedy has been replaced with soap opera hi-jinks; the writing seems to have come out of a high school drama class at times. So sad to see such a promising show hit the skids."
2,You will outgrow this book in two days...,"If I had it to do over again, I would just take the Microsoft tutorial that comes free on the FP 2000 disc, and then buy a MUCH MORE HEAVY DUTY reference book. While this book was entertaining and clear enough, FrontPage 2000 is far too complex a program to deal with in this ""Dummies"" format.I ended up very frustrated trying to understand the concepts, because they were far over-simplified.This book probably got me up and running more quickly on the basics of my first attempt at a web page. HOWEVER, the difficult answers - about folders, server extensions, PWS, etc. were glossed over too much to be of any value.You'll eventually need one of the 900 page reference works to be successful here..."
3,The title serves the book,"The book gives sufficient info so that you can get on with using FrontPage. It is quite humorous and the author tries not to keep you bored while reading this. However, I'd suggest another book unless you consider yourself somewhat a dummy. The author thoroughly explains things that are more or less common sense. Some things are very easy to understand so I suggest not reading a whole page reading about them, as a result if you familiar with Windows and have some experience with the Internet, don't waste your time reading this."
4,Great Inexpensive Headphones with great sound,I love these head phones. They are very Confortable and They have very good sound quility. But i have bought 7 paris of these in the past 9 months The resson is beccause Anytime U pull on the wire to hard it will break in the same spot right to the left of the left speaker. But otherwise These are great headphones. Just be carefull with them
5,From MCA/Universal's Classics starring Carole Lombard,"Carole Lombard is fabulous & beautiful in this 1934 Paramount Pictures love story co-starring Fred MacMurray.This VHS Black / White Standard picture (before WideScreen) is of great quality and clear sound. An original trailer is included.Summary - a manicurist (Lombard) is seeking to marry a millionaire. Broke Playboy (MacMurray) is also seeking to wed a wealthy spouse. As all depression black comedies they end up following in love no matter how hard they resist. Hollywood, Love & Fate of the 1930's guarrantees the audience to get a great story and a happy ending to boot.Lombard & MacMurray are fabulous. A fine performance by Ralph Belamy helps support this great story. This Lombard at her best. Enjoy."
2,Not what I expected,"I'm a HUGE John Berry fan, so I was excited to buy this CD. It doesn't carry as much of the score as I would like. The ""soundtrack"" part of the CD name should have been the dead give away.However, Sheen Easton's jazz song was great, and that was a pleasant surprise.If you liked the SONGS played in the movie, this CD is for you. If you liked the SCORE, don't get this CD."
2,A Vienna Tour Guide?,"Sorry, I don't speak German very well, and there is no English subtitle available. I only comment on what I visually percepted.All I saw was spots of Vienna you should go if you are on a Vienna music tour. Some movements of Mahler's symphonies were even entirely played with the pace of the film completely stopped.Mahler himself is vaguely visible. The film put too much focus on Natalie Bauer-Lechner and Anna von Mildenberg; and unforgiveably ignored another two women whom Gustav also considered important: Justi Mahler and Anna Mahler, not to say other musicians like Richard Strauss, Hans von Burlow, Jean Silbelius or Bruno Walter. Mahler's vision of music was also ignored."
4,Great read!,"I love Philippa Gregory's books. While The Other Boleyn Girl remains my favorite, I loved this one. The plot was a little far-fetched, but it's fiction. Anything can happen. I liked Hannah's character alot, she was a very unique person. Not the type of girl you'd expect to see in 15th century England."
3,No Fooling,"Phillipa Gregory does it again, blending historical personages with fictional ones to create a seamless view of the past. Her rich style calles for the reader's attention, but doesn't overwelm the fast moving story. Well worth the time, can't wait for the movie!"
3,The Queen's Fool,"I like ""The Other Bolyn"" much better. It was way more realistic. It's hard to believe that a women in this time of age would be alowed all the freedoms that she had. It's also hard to believe that a queen and a princess would hold such trust in her."
1,I don't get the rave reviewing...,"I slogged through this novel, hoping to find some redeeming value, only to be disappointed. I found the pace slow, repetitive, and mostly boring. Some of the plot twists were interesting, but barely believable. The main character, Hannah, had no integrity. She curried favor with whomever she happened to be with at the time, and was very disappointing. No heroine here, really. I really wanted to like her, but her feminism and intermittant chutzpa just didn't correlate with what is known about women of the time."
3,"Good, but not as good as The Other Boleyn Girl","I LOVED ""The Other Boleyn Girl"". Naturally, I wanted to read the trilogy. The Queen's Fool was good, but just not anywhere near at good as The Other Boleyn Girl. It was an interesting story, and I like the way Ms. Gregory tells her tales via a character who is in the middle of the action, but who is not the subject of much historical writing. I just found this particular character of the fool to be not very believeable. I think perhaps that is my biggest problem with this book. I just could not fully immerse myself in the story. It is entertaining and exciting and fun to read, I just did not think the quality was quite the same as the first book in the trilogy."
4,the queens fool,"liked it very much,book true to its time and place,love that ther was more about the the rerigon and how hard it was to worcip,and to be a women , book covers all things ,glad my time is not so bad,"
2,Missing the Other Boleyn Girl,"I opened this book with very high hopes after having devoured The Other Boleyn Girl. Initially the story is captivating, but I soon found that it dragged on and Hannah's alternating allegiances became hard to decipher and even more impossible to understand. She loved each women she served, yet she was disgusted by them as well. Her lust for Robert Dudley was also not well explained. It seems to have been based only on the physical attraction of a 14 year old. I found her utter devotion and service to a man she knew to be a scoundrel inconsistent with her expressed requirements of her own husband. I just didn't buy her character and as a result was disappointed with the novel. The fascinating historical potential of this book was buried underneath supernatural powers and flighty emotions. I wish I had left the series at The Other Boleyn Girl."
4,Great book!!,"Another wonderful read from Philippa Gregory. I read this on the heels of ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" a little out of sequence, I understand. In comparing the two, for me ""The Queen's Fool"" is far more subtle than ""Boleyn Girl"" yet is every bit as intriquing and interesting. This author does a great job in making the reader think what was behind Mary and Elizabeth's behavior.Highly recommend!"
4,"An Easy, Pleasant Read...","Like many others, I read The Queen's Fool after reading and loving The Other Boleyn Girl. I definitely found The Other Boleyn Girl to be the better of the two books. The author is great at mixing fact with fiction. The fiction part is the problem here. Parts seemed very repetitive and I, with my very meager knowledge of English history, could see what was coming with her move to Calais! Ideally I would have given this book 3 1/2 stars, but decided to round-up! Fast and enjoyable--good summer read."
4,Good Read,"I liked this book, especially when I could read it after reading the preceding book, The Other Boleyn Girl, but I didn't find it as capturing as its predecessor. I found Hannah a little weak and I didn't like how Queen Mary was portrayed; I pitied her, but still found her a bit obnoxious at times. This is a good read and gives another facinating look into the tumultuous Tudor-era. I would especially recommend reading this after reading The Other Boleyn Girl. Both of them together helps you understand the Tudor hisory much better."
3,I cry foul.,"I give it 5 stars for the Pythons and 1 star for A&E or 3 stars overall. A&E have to be commended for bringing the Pythons to DVD, but Jeers to them for exploiting us fans, After packaging 3-4 Avengers episodes per disk it is ridiculous for them to only include 3 Python Episodes per disk when 6-8 would easily fit. This is the type of crass commercialism the Pythons would usually ridicule. I cry foul."
5,Two classic episodes,"This tape features the first two episodes of my favorite show ""Monty Pythons flying circus"" the first episode is a bit slow at times... but the second episode hits on target every time."
5,Just Beautiful,What a lovely book. The photos are absolutely superb. So clear. Love the photo's of the owners wearing them. Such a diverse range of designs. The skill of the designers & the jewellers who made them is just brilliant. If you love jewellery this book will not disappoint you.
5,The size was not the problem,"I bought this product to brush our cats' molar teeth. Unfortunately, my finger that has no problem probing the molar tooth area gets too thick with the finger toothbrush on. So I don't use it anymore.I don't think this product is bad for human use(Therefore, 5 stars). The size was not a concern at all for both my husband and me who are average in size. But I can see this is not the ""one size fit all "" type."
4,Another name for Richard is to get off mine!!,"Another player hated white rapper who's actually not that bad, i remember a friend of mine had this album when it first came out in 93, we always tried to out do each other with our Import hip hop cds, this i remember fondly, produced by the Bomb squad, the production on this album is excellent and Chilly Travis's rap skills are quite cool too, especially tracks ""snap your necks to this"", ""get off mine"", and the best track ""crisis of idenity"". People who enjoy hip hop and dope lyrics should not discard this, its actually quite good, and is a rare album to own......"
1,Stay away!!!,"I advise you to stay away from this product AT ALL COST!!! I had high hopes that this DVR would be the trick. However, I was soon to realize it is like all the other DVR's-Full of Bugs. I got it set up and tried taping to the hard drive. I got a System Error that i could not get rid of. I contacted tech support. They had not even heard of the error number that I got. I returned it to the store the next day."
1,Ordered 2 and neither works,"I ordered this stereo and it took several months to arrive and then the doors didn't open. After returning that one, the second one arrived and the CD player didn't work."
3,could be better,"love the look! It's super classy looking for the home. Many CDs these days are very artistic looking and this is a great way to enjoy that feature. The player itself has a greenish tone to it's color and I love the way it looks in my home. The sound is fine for me, loud enough for house cleaning and clear for classical/relaxation music. Trouble is the doors have never really worked (but I did buy a used one). I wish 'they' (anyone!) would make more stereos that were as nice looking as this one."
3,Oddly programmed,"A lot of the first CD has some very nice material on it. I was hoping that the liner notes would give us the Sanskrit lyrics so we could sing along but alas, I'm not finding those. I'll keep looking. It took me awhile to figure out that the second disk was a DVD, not a CD, and I haven't watched it yet. The last cuts on the CD were all kind of downbeat--I like the more energetic stuff. And for some reason I didn't enjoy his mixing in the lyrics of ""Amazing Grace"" in with one of these kirtans--for me it made it seem to new-agey and distracting--like hearing English mixed in with the Latin mass. I dunno. I'm going to get another CD and hope to like it better."
3,abs workout,This is definitely a yoga gor beginners. It won't do much for your abs if you're an active person and work out even once a week.
1,BEGINNERS ONLY,"I love Rodney Yee,but this was the only abs yoga tape out there when I made the purchase. I really wish I hadn't because it is very slow paced and not intense. This is really just for Beginners. Don't buy unless this is your first time ever working out."
4,Subtle abdominal routine,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. After practicing twice per week, my core was noticably stronger. I also felt a stronger connection to my core. The moves are subtle and soothing, not the actions I would have associated with core strengthening. Now I have incorporated these movements when I do my ""traditional"" abdominal work-outs.My only complaint: I wish the DVD had multiple workouts, not just one twenty minute segment."
1,Never received product and no emails explanation for why,"Do not do business with this person. I paid for this product about a onth ago and I still have not received it. I believe thats a problem,especially when I paid this guy my hard earned money. If you need a abs product, look elsewhere."
4,Abs yoga for beginners,"Abs Yoga for Beginners is a great way to start out with yoga. Rodney Yee is a great teacher. It's 25 minutes of yoga workout for abs, at first I thought 25 minutes wasn't long enough... but it is! I'm really happy I bought this video!"
5,Very good instructor,"If you don't want to twist yourself into a pretzel and you require instruction as you are doing the poses, then Rodney Yee is the best, it's like he is in the room with you giving feedback. I purchased many of the beginners dvd mostly for back health and I have not been dissappointed.This is for men and women alike who want and exercise for health purposes. Of course Rodney has advanced yoga as well, but I wouldn't go there."
1,NOT for those wishing to learn Java Programming!,"I purchased this book while taking an Intro to Java class thinking it was a Java programming book; it is not. While I will probably find it useful if ever I decide to start building web pages using Java applets for fun, it is definitely not for anyone looking to learn or understand Java PROGRAMMING. From this purchase, I have definitely learned the hard way to read all of the REVIEWS prior to purchasing any books.Also, using the ""Search Inside"" tool (when available) to view the table of contents and the copyright date are a MUST for purchasing any future books!! I have used this function for several books and have been able to make better, more informed choices based on that information. If you have not used the ""Search Inside"" tool, I highly recommend doing so on your next purchase."
1,"Sadly, it only contains info on applets.","If you want to learn about applets, this might be the book for you. However, if you want to learn anything about Java, save yourself some time and go elsewhere. This book really only covers Applets and Html, and it doesn't seem to do either very well. I was very disappointed."
1,Weak Java,"Maybe I just missed something on the back cover, but this book doesn't teach you anything about Java. While I liked HTML for Dummies, this one is incorrectly titled. It should have been How to Use One Little Statement in HTML. All that's covered is how to use the <APPLET> command. If, like me, you want to learn how to write applets, you'll need another book."
2,"Cute sandal, bad quality","I purchased these sandals to wear to work and I loved them the first few days I wore them. However, after a week, the liner started to shred and pull up from the bottom on both sandals. The strap is sturdy and very pretty, but the sandal is cheaply made and they are falling apart after very little wear. I wish these were made better since they are reasonable and available in so many colors. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. Based on how they look after a week, I don't expect them to hold up more than a month."
4,Monster Ultra Series 600 HDMI Cable (4 ft.),"I bought the Monster Ultra Series 600 HDMI Cable (4 ft) three months ago for $120. It is connected to my HD Cablebox, creating such clear and crisp pictures and with no problems WHAT SO EVER!9 months ago, I bought a store brand (from a well known electronics store) $30 4 feet basic HDMI cable and had issues from day one with the following:-horrible pictures for HD for all HD channels when used for my HD cable box-picture flickering on and off when used for the Playstation3. (this issue has just gotten worse over time, with the picture flickering off more often than on.)I am finally investing in another of HDMI cable from this series for the Playstation3 because I am SO PLEASED with its performance. It is much cheaper than the first one I purchased but I would STILL pay $120 for it if I had to."
4,"Breif, poetic stories","The stories in this book are fantastic, poetic and abstract. The translation reads very smoothly, and retains a depth that many translation do not. (translations of other books, I have not read any other translation of this)It is unfortunate that the publisher was so careless when putting this book together, ugly pictures are placed haphazardly on the pages, sometimes cutting off sections of words. These pictures do not convey the feelings of the stories. They act as examples of words the reader may be unfamiliar with, but this is not a dictionary! If the publisher thought they were so necessary, they should have been placed at the back in some kind of glossary, or at least chosen taseful photos and arranged them with an eye for layout.Still, I highly recommend this book, and according to the other reviews this translation is superior to the others. Maybe someday a publisher will put this translation into a more elegant package."
2,Not my type,I'm a big fan of Ram Dass as a spiritual figure. I love his easy to understand and very sincere writings. But this CD is certainly not my type. This is more for the devotional type of person where words don't matter.
5,delighted,"I ordered this DVD a few days before Christmas because my sister mentioned how much she loved ""Abide With Me"" sung by this artist, who I have to admit, I'd never heard of. She had only heard it once on TV. I went right to Amazon, found it, ordered it and never dreamt it would arrive before Christmas. The order said it would arrive before Jan. 10th. Lo and Behold, it arrived two days before Christmas and my sister (who does not own a computer and had no idea things could be found this quickly) was over the moon. I have to admit, it is beautiful. Thank you Amazon!"
4,Teriffic singing,"Although the selection of songs were quite unusual, the performances, staging, and quality were of exceptional quality. Well worth seeing!"
1,rip off,"i am sure the CD is good (i read a review online that said it was good music)but we all know a CD costs pennies to make, so when they are charging almost $30 for a CD anymore, you know you are being ripped off.Dont support over-price music,boycott sellers that try to gauge their customers.This kinda greed is why the record business is going down, and I am glad to see it.If you werent so greedy, and just charged a fairprice, people wouldnt have to share for free.With rarer CDs like this, i think it'll take longer to become available online, but when it does, and rip off record companies trying to charge unfair prices for less common music are out of business too, i will not shed a tear,Like i said, BOYCOTT overpriced music.!!!"
2,Kinda bummer,"The contents are all right but I was disappointed to hear it all in American English voices and slight ""ethical"" adaptations from the real deal like not call the fat controler by the name used in the origonal version. My kid doesn't seem to mind though."
2,flush valve,the valve works ok but it could have had a larger in put of water coming in to flush harder and faster
2,weak flush,"We were looking for the ""Flush King"" for our TT. We saw a fellow camper use his and decided we would get one. I saw the Camco and thought it looked like the same thing for much cheaper. WRONG! This unit has a small hole for the water to spray. It takes forever to flush any amount of water to the black tank, plus the spray is so weak we were flushing forever. Not the strong spray of water the Flush King delivered. Wish we would have bought the FLUSH KING!"
4,Works well,"This works as stated, however it uses a lot of water and takes time. You need to fill/empty the black water tank several times to clean it completely. I have found it very useful in emptying my portable waste tank on the camper. My camper sewer outlet is very low to the ground so I connect my waste hose to the side outlet of my portable tank with the short hose provided with the portable tank. I connect the flush pro to the camper outlet, open the camper tank valve to empty it, then close the valve and use the pro flush to push clean water through the hose to the portable tank. I then close the valve to the portable tank trapping the clean water in the hose. I then remove the hose and let the clean water out and empty the portable tank."
5,Wonderful! Ms. Small does it again.,I couldn't put this one down (read it in one night). This book is a wonderful ending to the O'Malley series and a great finish to Wild Jasmine. I have read all of her books and have never shed so many tears. I'm looking forward to more from her.
5,2 Mysteries in 1 Volume,"This title comes with The Golden Spiders. I hope Amazon will come out with more Kindle Books like this. Thank You, Amazon Kindle."
3,"HipHop EJay6 is fun, but there are some downfalls to it...","In the time that I have had HipHop Ejay6, I have created 2 full songs and am still working on a 3rd song. I personally enjoy them to the extent that a musician can agreable enjoy his/her own music. However, I had to discover most, if not all, of the techniques and tools provided to successfully make music. HipHop Ejay6 doesn't come with anywhere near a complete ""user-guide"" to guide you through the music making process. All features are not explained thoroughly neither are they sufficient. HipHop Ejay5, which my good friend has, actually in my opinion was better in most regards. HipHop Ejay6 desperately needs a user-guide because it isn't that simple to just CREATE music as they say it is."
3,Barely ok,"Some good info in the book. However, they just kind of throw it at you. It's not as in depth as it really should be. Most examples are very shallow. A much better way to learn access is to actually build something. This might be a good book to have as a supplement for another that you are going through. They book contains both ""raw basic"" content AND ""Somewhat advanced"" content. In my opinion, I do not think it very efficient to mix these as then a large percentage of the book is useless to everyone in some way.For me, there are about 20 useful pages.Still though, it was worth it for those 20 pages."
2,I expected something better,"I work in finance and I wanted to lear Access a little bit. This book does not come with a CD, you have have to type up all the examples. It could be time consuming, exspecially when it comes to databases.I am at page 28 trying to learn how to create an unmatched query. The author leaves you hanging,he brings up the relationships, however it only introduces them on page 72. And basically starts a line of tought and you have no idea about the rest.I feel like, he could have two options, first introduce the basic stuff what you need to understand this or don`t even start on this.It is very annoying to start a problem and don`t finish it.I would not recommend this book!"
3,L7 and Barry Manilow. Together at last.,"1. Gas Chamber (03:59)performed by L-72. Daybreak (03:06)performed by Barry Manilow3. Main Title (Mom's Suburban Dream) (04:48)Tracks 3-10 are the film score4. Morning Suite (I'll Get You Pussyface!) (02:05)5. It's Been a Crazy Day, Hasn't It? (03:23)6. Flea Market Suite (Stood Up and Skewered) (07:02)7. The Sterner Payback (05:40)8. Buckle Up, Scotty!! (02:36)9. Courtroom Suite (In Memory of a Fashion Victim) (03:01)10. I'm Coming Home! (03:20)I've seen better soundtracks. Not quite worth it for one Camel Lips song (L7)."
4,Klaus Schulze proves he still has a place in the 21st century.,"To be honest I was never that big of a Klaus Schulze fan,I prefer the variety of Tangerine Dream(for better or for worse)to Schulze's overlong often redundant ""songs"".Moonlake however is a happy surprise.Yes the tracks are still long but the beats are hypnotic,there's variety as they go along to keep your interest and there are some unexpected moments too like near the middle of Playmate in Paradise.I'm still not a huge fan of Schulze but Moonlake is a pulsing mesmerizing work."
2,Book,"I was required to read a book on diversity. This one filled the bill but it was a very dry, boring read about things I already knew."
5,BEST INSTRUMENTAL HOLIDAY MUSIC,"I agree with the Denise-Mary review. Very tastefull arrangements dripping with creativity. Acoustic instruments including hammered dulcimer and piano. This recording is great to listen to any time. When I play this for guests, they always ask who is playing. I recommend this disc highly."
1,Rather Irritating Read,"This book starts off promising. But, once you realize that the main plot of the novel is based on a small quarrel between husband and wife- it's really annoying. The problem can so easily be solved and yet Heyer takes 200 pages of endless reading to do so. Don't get me wrong- I'm a huge Heyer fan.. I loved Sylvester, These Old Shades and the grand sophy. But, this novel was among her few failures."
2,Stupid heroine,"I must agree with the other reviewer on this book. I usually love Heyer's books but this is the most boring and irritating story of hers. I cannot stand a stupid heroin who cannot just admit her own fault and sank deeper and deeper while trying to conceal it. ""Tell him (the husband) and be done with it!"" was what had been in my mind while reading it. I did not have any pleasure from this book. Better avoided."
4,Foundations of Education (Student Text),"The professor was kind enough not to ask us to buy the new eleventh edition, the tenth edition was chosen to save us all some money. If I had to buy this book at the college bookstore I would have spent double. And when I go to sell it back to the bookstore they give me 50 cents on the dollar. So, for better than 50 cents on the dollar I have the book, and if I chose to keep it I still did better than going to the college bookstore. Great savings for me, I get to add the book to my library if I choose, and it arrived in plenty of time to use for class. I look forward to buying more textbooks this way."
4,Foundations of Education Ninth Ed.,"Great book if you are new to the education game. A lot of information on history of education, different philosophies and theories of education. The only negative is the cost. Buy used if you can and save your money for other used textbooks."
1,Did NOT get all parts,"I ordered this product and it was supposed to come with a hand pump to recharge it and it was not in the package. Furthermore, the company has not returned calls or e-mails. Buyers beware."
5,Wish I had invented this one...,Cuts the time to swap heads down to just seconds. I put this in my craftman cordless drill and set the torque on the drill low. That almost dialed in the head on assembly. A few seconds of fine tuning by hand and you are back to playing. It works like it is meant to.
5,Fun Camera,"I bought this camera for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. She has the red model and it fits nicely in her purse (or even pocket). I think it's great that the batteries are rechargeable - you just plug it in like your cell phone. The screen is bright and she has used some of the options- video and sound - but has not used most of other features. The SD card is great too, since we have other equipment (flash, cameras) that use the same card. We use our SD reader to copy pictures to the desktop and our printer software to organize/edit since we have other cameras also. So far it has held up well, and she is pretty hard on her euqipment. We ordered from Adorama Camera - it also comes with a nice protective case. All in all takes nice pictures and easy to use."
4,Good camera for the price,"I owned this camera for about a year. I really had no complaints about the picture quality or the cameras interface, and the video quality was surprisingly good as well. It is a tough little camera(mine was dropped more than a few times with no problems) and the software that was supplied with the camera did it's job. I live in a harsh climate (for digital camera's anyway), very salty and humid, so my did eventually succumb to the brash forces of the climate."
4,the best digicam under $100!,"with this 5 mega still camera, you can take about 70 minutes 640X480@30fps mpeg4 video if you have a 1g SD memory card! think of the price is under $100!"
2,But only if you must,"This is dry, dry stuff. Hardly worth the paper it's printed on. Buy only if you must, as for a textbook."
2,fair,"this is another dvd import i purchased.video not good-but the sound is ok.i,m a glen ford fan & this was one of his hard to find movie,s,so i had to buy it."
5,Time Machine takes you back.....,"WOW!!! Where to begin...Let's keep it simple. Reasons to pick up Crooklyn Vol. 2.It has the extended version of People Make the World Go Round by The Stylistics(the version with the long instumental break at the end), Bra by Cymande(that alone is worth picking this up for the bass break!!!Love it!!!)Soul Makossa by Manu Dabango, it is remastered & it is just a great car tunes CD!!So put this in your CD player or whatever listen device you are using & get into the time machine back to less stressful times...no cell phones, no cable, being home before the street lights come home...well you get it.Enjoy my friends...Keeping R & B alive...."
5,Works for me,"Bought these for a couple windows that I'm not sure what I'm going to do with yet. It's an inexpensive fix, and they block the sun coming in these windows, which was the point. If they get dirty or torn, I can take them down and recycle them. I am actually going to order a couple more and keep them in reserve."
1,Worst PC Game ever,"This game is the worst game ever created. I spent bought this game and returned it for Sims Superstar. Sims Superstar is the best game ever created. By the way, all Sims games that were created are the best!"
3,it's ok i guess,"I think this game is ok, except for the fact that you can only zoom down to the view of 1000 feet high! It's fun training animals, though, and building a park, but once I built a park that stretched across the whole area, and it had the best attractions, but it only had a rating of 2 1/2 stars; the same as when I started out.I would recommend another game."
2,A Complete Nightmare!,"I'm really not a picky person when it comes to PC games. I love them all that have at least some quality to them. This is an exception. The game was painful to try and control, the graphics were so-so, and when you ride the (so-called) rides, it's completelly amateurish! You don't get the ""feeling"" of riding a ride like you can with Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.It may appeal to the younger crowd but I wouldn't reccomend it the PC Game savvy. That was a mistake on my part on buying a game before I know more about it. Luckily I have a little nephew that adores it. That's why I gave it 3 stars because seeing a smile on his sweet face makes me feel it was worth the buy. :)"
2,Dry Erase Boards,"I was displeased with the item as well as my fellow co-workers. While we wanted a large dry erase board to plot out our mental thinking, we did not want something super flimsy and thin. THe price was right but the quality was crap. Packaging also was subpar and the dry erase board is practically bent at a 45 degree angle from shipping... try hanging that on the wall!"
1,Board in pieces when arrived,"The board was already badly fractured when it arrived at my home. I didn't even need to open a whole seal-tape to see that. So I returned it the next day (luckily the refund came smoothly without hassle).Because of its apparently poor quality, I don't recommend this product."
2,Big board but low quality,"I bought a couple of these boards for use at the office. The arrived very quickly but all of them were warped and had to be secured to the wall with mirror clips just so they would remain flat and not curl up from the wall. For what they are, they work ok, they're big and cheap. However, I have had them for a week or two and they're already starting to not fully erase. I would not use any color markers on these boards or leave anything on them for an extended period of time. Make sure you erase frequently and have a big bottle of white board cleaner.I would not recommend this product, spend a little more and get a higher quality board."
1,"Warped Board, Horrible Quality","I was very excited to get this large of a board for a fraction of the price that I saw in Office Depot, etc., however upon receipt of this item, I realized why it was so cheap. The board is warped on all four sides and will not lie flat against the wall, no matter how many screws/nails I used to try to attach it.The seller also took a very long time in responding to my questions and request for cancellation. In fact, they only replied to my request for cancellation three days after it was shipped.Horrible board, poor quality, and weak customer service. If I could give it a 0 star or negative star I would. Do not purchase this product"
1,totally warped,"This board was great for about 2 months, and then suddenly warped to the point where the bottom right corner actually bent out from the wall about 10 inches. The back is made of cardboard, so the overall product is flimsy. I am throwing it away today, and I am going to replace it with a higher quality board. This product is definitely not a good choice."
3,Flimsy and easily bent,"This board was received bent in the middle and bottom, thus attesting to how flimsy it is. As a simple dry erase board, it works OK, but in hindsight I would not have paid as much as I did for it - it's just not built well enough to justify the price."
2,Not enough Packing,"This product arrived in a badly beaten up box and when I opened it up the white board was warped in many places and the aluminium pen holder was bent out of shape. Inside the flimsy cardboard there is a very small amount of styrofoam along the edges of the whiteboard, and that's it. If something pierces the cardboard its going to hit the board that's pretty much guaranteed. The other reviews are either brilliant or like mine, so if you are purchasing this board then you have a 50/50 chance of it arriving broken or pristine, it might also help to look how far the package is shipping because that will increase the likelihood that it will be damaged in transit. But if you do decide to order the whiteboard and it does come damaged the company seems to have a very good refund policy. So buy it if you have time to send it back, but if you need it tomorrow go somewhere else."
3,bent board with huge crack,"The board is not bad, it's clearly thin and inexpensive in terms of quality, but that's also nice for mounting and slim appearance. The problem I had was the shipper sent it with a custom-cut box that didn't protect the board during shipping. I received a bent board with a crack in the dry-erase field.I hammered out the bent part in a few seconds, so that wasn't a big deal, but the crack is permanent. Since its at the base of the board in an area that can be overlooked, I decided to keep it instead of dealing with returning this giant monster item. You may not be so lucky."
1,Damaged in shipment,"In reading the other reviews I was concerned about damage during shipment, but figured it had been awhile so they must have done something about it. Nope. The package was stove in near the middle and the whiteboard looked like it had been punched. I will return it. Too bad, it was a decent whiteboard for the money."
2,Dry Erase Board,"The board was damaged when received, and it is buckled in the middle. I am going to have to force it to lay flat on the wall. not happy with this product"
2,Dry Erase Board...minor fiasco,"Received the board within 4 days. Board was damaged. Called CSR; they said they will send me a new one, and send me return shipping info. One week later I called, they said they will take care of it... this time I can keep my old board, they will just send a new, undamaged one. One week later I had to call again, and they will send the order was never put in, or accepted, or whatever... finally I received the undamaged board. Scenario was a pain due to unskilled or uncaring CSR. The board is cheap, I got exactly what I was looking for... BUT the CSR was poor. Would not recommend purchasing products from this company as you can purchase the same items from other companies and get better service."
2,"Cheap, arrived badly packed, massively warped and dented.","Arrived poorly packed and slightly dented. I bent back out the dented marker holder--so that was fixable. However, upon trying to hang it up, noticed right away it was massively warped.I decided to just nail the thing into the wall on all four corners, which forces it to even out and makes it usable.I wish I would've gotten the board that was about $15 more (with black corners) and bought it from a different supplier (the one I got was from Plexsupply) as this was all around a bad deal."
1,Arrived cracked in half,I should have listened to the other reviewers. Don't make the same mistake I did. Product is packed so poorly it really is a roll of the dice whether it will arrive safely or not. I also have a feeling I am not getting reimbursed for the original shipping charge.
3,Great Product for the Price,"Great product for the price compared to paying full price for the others. I hung it up and the next day the bottom right corner lifted up, just put some velcro on the bottom. Still happy I'm not going to complain because I saved 50 bucks."
3,"Decent whiteboard, terrible packaging","This is quite lightweight whiteboard, decent quality, non-magnetic, erases well, doesn't seem to ghost.However, the packaging is TERRIBLE and doesn't protect the whiteboard at all.I ordered 2 whiteboards, one of them shipped in good condition, but the other one came with the white surface broken in the same spot where the packaging cardboard got punched during transportation. Had to return it.The packaging should REALLY be improved, they should add some styrofoam or airbags layer between the whiteboard surface and the cardboard, as there was no protection there, and any damage to the box causes damage to the whiteboard."
4,"Good board, terrible packaging","I had read from other reviewers that a lot of these boards weren't packaged well & they showed up bent or broken, but since this was the cheapest option for this size board I decided to take the risk. My board wasn't ruined when it arrived, but the bottom left corner (right where the marker tray is) was definitely bent. If I were just hanging this on my wall it would be way too bent to lie flat, but luckily we are mounting it to a piece of plywood so it shouldn't be a problem for us (we'll be adding hinges & using the dry erase board to cover up a large utility box on the wall). The board itself is pretty good. Good quality & it wipes completely clean. If it hadn't been bent I would have given it 5 stars."
3,Shipping was terrible.,"The marker board looked fine, other than the huge crack in it. They packaged this item terribly. It is a thin flimsy board, which is fine for the price and size (It is huge), but I think they need to package it accordingly. They did schedule someone to pick it up and they refunded my money without any problems."
3,Carole Lombard Gets to Play a Killer in Rare Dual Role,"If you're willing to overlook the holes in the plot, this is a fascinating film that shows just what a great actress Lombard was. The scenes in which innocent Roma is possessed by the spirit of the dead female murderer is the best thing about the film. Here Lombard is allowed to do a feminine ""Dr Jekyll and Ms. Hyde"" transformation with nothing more than a little dark eyeshadow, deeper baritone voice and sharp glances. Though physically she looks different from the killer (possibly based on a real-life 1930s murderess), her body language is totally dead-on with the earlier actress' moves and the conversion is totally convincing. This is a great pre-code film that shows Lombard's range, which sadly, she wasn't allowed to do much outside of comedy."
3,Whale of a Tale,"If you are buying this for a kid, then it may be okay. Old time comedians in this movie, not including William Shatner, but Andy Devine, who must be in his 80s in this, and Marty Alan, It's okay. At the end, you get some nice five minutes of film footage of the whale shows at Marineland. Other than that, had the movie been a little shorter, the story would be more tolerable, but it kind of goes on a little too long to the point of predictability."
3,Short Life,"Although these plugs seemed to increase fuel efficiency, their lifespan was about half of other spark plugs I use. These were installed on a 2004.5 VW Jeta GLI. The regular service interval for the Jetta's 1.8L engine is about 40K miles. The E3's didn't make it past 20K miles. After about 12K miles, my car began having idling issues. I had random misfires on all cylinders, and toward the end of their life (about 18K miles), I had a bad misfire on cylinder one. When I pulled the plugs to replace them, some of the electrodes had a noticeable warped shape. These plugs just don't seem to have long-term potential."
3,Frustrating for younger players,"Although this game is well-designed and fun, for younger players it is extremely frustrating. Any game that purports to be rated E for everyone, including young players who may lack the skills to play at the higher game levels, should include either shortcuts or cheats so the full features of the game can be enjoyed by all who play."
1,Unworkable,"In my opinion this book is completely unworkable. For a company to be able to follow this book and try to impliment what the author is suggesting would be an administrative nightmare. The company would have to be cash rich, non-competitive and be overstaffed to cope with doing things his way. I wonder if the author has any actual experience of putting in ISO 9000 in a commercial company because my company certainly could not afford to do it his way."
4,Steed Does A Deadly Dance - Emma Tries A Soft Shoe,"""The 13th Hole"" is nowhere near as bad as it's touted-up to be. It's a solid Avengers entry, benefiting from some of the best Steed and Mrs. Peele banter to be found, a good concluding fight, and a humorous conclusion. Diana Rigg, especially, is at her sparkling best, delivering one of the funniest lines she ever had, ""I am your Fairy Godmother! Fear not, for ere this day is done, you shall have shot a hole in one!"" The plot is clever, reminiscent of the golf game in the James Bond movie Goldfinger, and the whole is suitably bizarre to fit nicely into the Avengers ouevre. I'm actually quite fond of this one, though it's fairly obvious I stand alone - on the 13th hole, as it were.""Slow Death"" is simply fabulous, with some of the best wit and character interplay in the entire series. Emma's trip to the shoe salesman, and her and Steed's dancing away a nest of spies, are just too funny for words. This is one of the best of Rigg's first season."
2,Just okay,"I found this book to be lacking in plot, with too many characters with little to no character development. I read this book in under a week and I still could not follow which character was which. And since it was supposed to take place in the present, the occurances were too unrealistic. I didn't hate it but it was just okay."
3,fast easy swashbuckling read,"Based on the reviews, I expected to be swept away (ha) by the book. I wasn't. It is fun and action packed. I enjoyed this book but never felt attached to the characters or their plights - as it reads like a movie script, moving quickly from scene to scene."
4,"""Farewell?""","This album has a ""State Of The World Address"" feel to it. If this indeed is their last album I'm glad they at least when back to the original Biohazard sound... Close to it anyway. But I'm not knocking any of their previous releases. Personally I think they are all worth picking up. I hope they change their mind and record some more material."
1,Misleading Item description,"This seller is trying to mislead sellers into thinking this is a high quality Tokyo Marui P90 replica, which it is not. I'm not sure what brand it is, but I'm guessing its the poor quality knock off P90 made by WELL. Just wanted to make sure everyone knew that, so you dont expect too much when you get this item."
3,Gothic 2 Gold,Game feel old and boring... Poor graphics and sound. Just to out dated and not worth the money.
5,Very professional bag indeed,"Comfortable, easy to carry, protects the cajon really well, handy front pocket, the cajon fits in and out just fine. Definitely a good buy"
2,Not good as a boxed set - checkout 007219524X instead,"While the first two volumes covered the testing material fairly well, the last two volumes (Fundamentals II & Performance Tuning) compare very poorly to their counterparts published by Oracle Press. I have bought other Sybex study guides, and they have been nothing but good to me. This ""kit"" comes up a little short. If you must absolutely buy a boxed set for the cost savings, I would recommend Oracle Press's set ISBN 007219524X also available at Amazon.In the book for Fundamentals II, the coverage of networking, Shared Server and imp/exp is VERY sparse. While the sections on Backups is better, the Oracle Press books were a little more on target in presenting concepts for the exam.The Oracle Press book for Performance Tuning was a much better choice not only for the exam, but also works as a great reference at my desk. Again, the material and its presentation was more complete and representative of the concepts tested on the exam."
2,"Useful, if somewhat inflexible","Many useful, if obvious, ideas here but more often than not it's ""my way or the highway."" The author has little tolerance for those of us who prefer a certain amount of ""chaos"" at work. Look elsewhere before making yourself guilty about your office habits. ""Ergonomic Living"" offers a much more realistic and thoughtful approach to the ""real world"" modern office."
4,Tea Rose Tea Kettle,"I like the shape, the quality of the product is consistent with what I expect from Pfaltzgraff. It works well and satisfies the need I had."
3,Straight To The Point Will Satisfy You,"Damion ""Crazy Legs"" Hall, once part of the New Jack Swing trio Guy with his brother Aaron Hall (who is featured on one cut on this debut CD), breaks out with own MCA album, Straight To The Point. Straight To The Point peaked at a decent No. 22 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart in 1994, while the New Jack/Retro-styled ballad, ""Satisfy You"" and the catchy funk-smokin', New Jack Swing number ""Do Me Like You Wanna Be Done"" successfully charted on the R&B Charts. The production mainly focuses on a tight blend of New Jack and retro arrangements, and the unpredictable tendencies common on introductory releases. Some songs contain to much instrumentation, and Hall's voice is abyssal. Damion is still very unclear whether he wants to be a balladeer or new jack vocalist, or retro/old school artist, but when things jell, Hall has you yearning for more. Crazy Legs proves he has the skills to be a successful solo artist outside of Guy."
5,My daughters loved this story!,"We all loved this charming, cute, funny book, from Daddy down to our two year old. The illustrations are clever and the surprise ending makes this a memorable Halloween read aloud. This should become a classic."
5,CUTEST HALLOWEEN BOOK EVER!,"CUTEST HALLOWEEN BOOK EVER!This witch is small, except her nose...SO...she dresses up in all these clothes...AND...you can see that she is ""truly a frightening-looking, horrible, witchey witch...""BUT...when she tries to do magic...nothing happens...SO...(You will need to read the book to find out the ending...too good to spoil :)"
5,AWSOME!!!,"I realy liked this book. Its about a girl named Libby who is a ""wellfair kid"". She has a little trouble at firs liking the Johnsons but soon shes very happy with them. The Johnsons taught her about the love of Christ. I couldnt stop reading the series. Im on book #5. I also like it because it is a mystery series! :)"
3,WHAT!?,I am really mad now. WHY WOULD ONE HAVE TO PAY FOR XBOX LIVE TO PLAY OFFLINE. Boy i have some really nasty comments to say to the creators. Ya its a great game but paying to play offline is...not a good idea. eight dollars a month for a few years does not add up in your favor. and i almost bought it...jeesh
2,Doesn't keep my coffee hot.,"I've had this Stanley vacuum bottle for a couple of months now and I have to say I'm really dissapointed in it. I pre-heat it with hot tap water before I fill it in the morning. I then fill it with fresh hot coffee and bring it to work. By the time I get to work (1 hour commute) the coffee is already only luke-warm and needs to be reheated! Not good. I have an older full size stanley thermos that works great and keeps coffee steaming hot all day, but this 0.5 qt size is just bleeds off all the heat. As soon as I fill it the whole bottle becomes hot, so you know it's transmitting the heat to the outside of the bottle.There are a few positives. It looks old school cool and is really rugged. Too bad it doesn't work for the one thing I require a vacuum bottle for."
4,Another American Icon...,"Another American icon now made in China. I'm sure it'll still work as well as the older made in America bottles. Slightly disappointed this one doesn't have the ""pour through"" stopper the 2 quart bottle has. These do everything they say...keeps coffee hot all day, and completely unbreakable. I'll get over the China thing, it's just one more thing."
4,Great picture,"I bought this TV a few years ago for my front room and now it is in my bed room it still has a great picture and i love it, good buy"
1,Do not waste your money on this book!,"There are several good books on narcissism, andthis is not one of them. Adding practically noinsight, the author elaborates the most basicaspects of narcissism such as one might find in alarge general encyclopedia or small dictionary ofpsychology. There is almost no material on theimportant alternative theories of narcissism;Kohut, Mahler, and Jacoby aren't mentioned. Whynot spend your time and money on somethingworthwhile? Try Mario Jacoby, ""Individuation andNarcissism,"" instead. You may not agree with him,but the discussion and bibliography will probablylead you to something good that's more to yourtaste. Sorry about that, Dr. Lowen; better lucknxt time.--Jonathan Ketchum, PhD (Philosohy)"
5,Beautiful Piece!,"This is a beautiful, big piece. Great looking on! Really fast shipping too! I would definetly buy from Dan's again..."
5,"Great product, prompt delivery","Delivery was prompt, product arrived in excellent condition. Will definitely give the vendor future business!"
4,KYB Gas-a-Just shock review,Seller shipped fast. Shock was easy to install and works well.Seems to be a good product. What else can I say? It's a shock!
4,Formerly known as The Filmgoer's Companion...,"This volume was titled ""The Filmgoer's Companion"" but this year changed to ""Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies"". Personally, I like the former title better. Fortunately, this is still the same book in regard to content. It has some great quips and quizzes for those movie buffs out there and great references for more obscure work that some of these actors/actresses/producers and directors did. Well worth the price!"
2,Nice flashlight... Questionable Blacklight,I guess you can't expect one product to do it all can you. This works great as an everyday flashlight but isn't that great in the blacklight department. It was picky on what it would pick up. We also had a cheap blacklight that would pick up more than this one.
5,Very Well Built,"I am pretty impressed with the quality of the flashlight casing. It does seem very durable although I havent tested it. I also like the weight. The light is not totally uniform but it has a good brightness in both UV and regular mode. I also liked the lifetime warranty info on the package.The only down side is that using the UV light may bother your eyes some. Thats not the flashlight though, its the fact that its UV. I understand some people wear yellow protective goggles when using UV, I might get some."
1,Ordered twice and never got the right product,"Amazon outdid themselves trying to get the right item sent to us, and we don't blame them one bit that the company involved sent the wrong item twice. The dimensions of the item sent were about half of what was advertised. We did get a prompt refund."
1,Don't Spend Your Shekels on this CD!,This Pianola Jazz CD has the very worst sound quality -by a wide margin- of the many ragtime and 1920s CDs that I've ordered from Amazon.
3,OK,"I was looking for a muffin cookbook with lots of apple recipes, this didn't have more than one, I don't think. I like apples & cinnamon."
2,So So remake,"This film was made three times.1929 version,1943 version,and the 1953 version.My pick is the 1943 one with Dennis Morgan,Irene Manning,Bruce Cabot,Lynne Overman,Gene Lockhart,Faye Emerson,Gerald Mohr,Victor Francen,etcThe 1929 John Boles version wasnt too bad.The 1953 version is the only one out on DVD."
4,Competition,"I didn't buy this but it is available at [...] and it includes 8 26watt 5500k bulbs. The description above is a bit confusing, but I believe the set here (and there) includes 2 stands, 2 reflectors, and 4 fluorescent light bulbs to go in each base - so 8 bulbs. You have to have a lot of bulbs to get it bright enough with fluorescent. After doing a lot of research, I decided to go with tungsten bulbs - the QL-1000, which are 1000 watt bulbs. They get a lot hotter than fluorescent, but include a fan on the light to cool.I wasn't sure how flexible this light kit would be so I decided to spend a bit more for a more professional setup - you can get a tungsten lamp that includes a softbox, barndoors (reflectors), and a 6.5' stand for about $209. Just shop around and be sure you know what you're getting. Lighting is the most important part!! and you want a flexible resource."
3,Only for digital cameras,"The lighting kit came on time and although it was relatively simple to set up, no instructions came with it. One of the supplied bulbs was not working. I had a bit of a problem putting on the difusser cap on, as they are from cloth and when you tighten on one side, another part gets loose. The soft white color from fluorescent bulbs is not equivalent to daylight temperature, so the photos come a bit blue/greenish, unless you make adjustments in your digital camera. I am concerned about the final color output when you combine it with flash, which has daylight color temperature.Other than that, the kit is fine. I suggest that you search a bit more and get a flash unit."
5,handy reference- especially for new grads!,This book was required for my first course in mechanical design and I've kept is as a desk reference at work. The book is well organized and practical. The techniques outlined in the later chapters apply good design techniques and provide usable information for machine component designers. I recommend this book to anyone requiring a mechanical reference.
1,HE DOES HAVE QUITE THE DIRTY DINGUS.,"I'm just sitting there watching this and suddenly Dirty Dingus' actual Dirty Dingus flies out of the screen into my mouth. At first it tasty like cherries, but then I remembered there was a dingus in my mouth so i slapped it and it disappeared along with my v1rginity. I am very uncomfortable with my body now. Especially the part near my anu5."
5,Woooow!!!!!,"Leaves your deck bright white, melts dirt and grease away. Washes away very easily. No need to look further. Just use a good scrub brush or deck brush and you won't be sorry."
3,is a bit racist here in the U.S.,"A beautiful picture book of chameleons for young people...unfortunately the text leaves an impression that angry beings are dark-colored while happy one are ""pale"". Here in the United States (the book is from New Zealand) this creates an unfortunate mind-set amongst preschoolers re: dark-colored teachers vs. ""pale"" ones.The photographs themselves are an invaluable introduction to chameleons, so I've kept the book in my read-aloud library by altering a few words of the text.If you wish to see these alterations, email me atstory-telling@philsheridan.com"
5,"The printers were pristine, new and worked great","The printers arrived on time, in great condition, and they have been working great for our customer.We were very happy with the service and product."
1,Pure junk!!!,The end of the hose was split when I recvd it and when I tried to rethread the fitting on it just continued to tear. Not a heavy duty hose at all.
2,Salad Tongs,Very ornate but you have to be a petite chef (I do not qualify) because it is small in stature. It certainly is up to the task of serving. It makes an impressive table presentation.
2,Well...,"I have no issues with the quality of the book. It was shipped fast, got here on time, and I have no issues with anything as far as that goes.My issue is with the material itself, this book is old and outdated. There are some useful ideas tucked away in this little book. But I would advice you to find another source if you are thinking about picking up a book on project management. There is so much junk in this book, based on how the authors writing style is you seriously just need to read the first sentence or two of each paragraph and skip the rest.Pass on this book and keep looking. I would have given it a 1.5 star review but feeling nice I rounded up."
3,Wow... a lot of great reviews,"I hate to give an average review when all the others are so great, but I bought the book to read while on the plane. Of course, I new it was short, but I read it in the 50 minutes before getting on the place. Mainly because it is a lot of rehash of Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" or Tony Alessandra's ""Charisma"" among others.I don't say this to be overly negative (I wouldn't want to lack charm while reviewing the book [smile]) it's just that if you've read more than three books on communication skills or influence in the past five or six years, you've already learned 98-99 percent of what this book has to say. If, however, you are totally new to this kind of reading, you may find the book useful. It could also be good as a refresher.Tom Carpenter"
4,Thin,"I like reading ""How-to"" books. So obviously I couldn't miss this one. As far as I liked what was inside, the problem is that there wasn't much of it. The book is extremely thin and for that reason I cannot give it 5 stars. Out of other ""how-to"" books my favorite are ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegi and especially ""Never Eat Alone"" by Keith Ferrazzi"
1,".Tie was received with a cut in it! Request replacement, was told to return damage tie first.","RECEIVED WITH A CUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TIE! REQUESTED A REPLACEMENT TIE FOR, OLD TIE WHICH WAS RECEIVED DAMAGED IN SHIPPMENT....PLEASE CONTACT ME.THE TIE HAS ALSO BLACK STAIN ON IT..."
3,Average radio,"The 1st 300PE I bought was dead in one month. It just shut by itself. I like its sound so I bought another one. It worked fine after one year. I like its AM/FM sound quality- very clear. I plug it in to an external speaker and it is good. Shortwave is just average - sensitive anough but with a lot of noise and drifting. When I change battery, I have to re-set memory and clock - I hate this, very inconvenient. Also I may have to reset it (a tiny hole in the back), or nothing works-another inconvenience."
2,Mixed Up Confusion,"By blurring psychedelic with the avant/garde and progressive, DeRogatis loses the focus needed to look through the kaleidoscope.Perhaps a furthur printing/revision should be under yet another new title. Like, ""Just Plain Weird Music.""A bit of advice can be heeded from Flaming Lips' booking agent/manager/metor/brains, Michele....~It's hypocritical/impossible to sing/write about the drug experience (esp. psychedelics) if one doesn't actually do them.~There does seem to be some phoniness behind the reactionary, knee-jerk historical revisionism riddling the book.Like an au currant indie-rock hipster faking disinterest in the rock stars of the 60's, DeRogatis doth protest too much.Uptight, ya' know..maaaaaan?"
2,If you need the bare minimum...,"There is two sides to this book. In one respect it is not nearly as comprehensive as it should be, in the other, it is ideal for someone who knows nothing about computers. Windows Professional for Dummies takes you through the bare minimum of features on a step-by-step basis. The advantage of this is that you don't have to be a genius to use the book, but the disadvantage is that you don't get as much out of the book as you would have liked. When my father first started using a PC he knew nothing about it and this book was a great start for him. I am impressed by my father's progress since he received this book, but I realize that most of his progress was through trial and error, not through this book. If you have to learn how to click a mouse, this book is great, if you want to be able to do more, I would recommend you look for another book."
3,Great Replacements,My husband had this Panasonic razor for quite a few years and replacement blades and foils are needed from time to time. The razor does an excellent job of shaving....quite close and smooth. These replacements work fine and give a shave like a brand new razor.
1,Shaver Head,Panasonic WES9006PC Replacement Inner Blade and Outer Foil Combination for Pro Curve Linear ShaversThe head had damage. I was not satisfied with the product.
5,Nice product,"You can weight yourself, drink a six ounce bottle of something, weight yourself again, and this scale shows the difference. Pretty nice."
4,"Weight measurement good, other features bad",This scale is great for measuring weight. The features to measure body fat and water composition are not really that accurate. They are greatly affected by the moisture in your foot. If you measure straight out of the shower you get a drastically different reading for body fat and water than if you just take your shoes off.
3,A very durable scale that is accurate for the most part,"The Tanita Duo Scale Plus Fat Monitor is considered a very durable scale that is accurate for the most part, with some reported exceptions usually involving external factors. If you are planning to count calories, or monitor heart rate and body fat during your intense workout sessions, then a Tanita monitor is certainly nothing less than a safe buy. Jody Bissoon"
2,Weight measurement right on....body fat % is a joke......,"The weight measurement is extremely accurate. I would go with a simple weight measurement scale or keep seaching for body fat % scales if you want accurate results. My scale consistantly says that my body fat % is between 30% and 40%. It requires you to plug in your height and wight...I am a 5'8'' female weighing about 145 lbs... so basically there is absolutely no possible way for my body fat percent to be in the 30s or the 40s. Its measurements are not even close to reasonable. I knew it was wrong, but the numbers still scared me, so I had a fitness assessment at my gym and they measured my body fat with the calibers (much more accurate method) and it was 18%...huge difference and I will stick to that!"
3,Weight consistent...other measurements not,"The company was late in shipping. If you like gadgets, it's fun; but I question the accuracy. In three days' time -- weight remained steady (darn), water reduced 6%, and body fat went up over 5%??? I don't think so!"
2,Not As Advertised!!!,"As a 16 year old teenager struggling with his own weight problems, I bought the Tanita BF679W scale thinking that I could monitor my weifght everyday.Well, when I got my product, I enthusiastically took the time out of my schedule to program it with my age, height, and gender.But, when I tried scaling my weight for the first time, the scale DID NOT read out my water percentage as advertised. I soon learned this is because Tanita's water percentage only works on older ages 20+. This is strange because the manual specifically says that Tanita supports programming from ages 7 and up."
3,Tanita Scales Read Body Fat Higher by 5-8%,"After weighing myself consistently for a week, the scale continued to read 42% body fat. A couple days later I registered for the National Body Challenge and they took my fat percentage and said I was actually at 37% body fat. A personal trainer told me the hand-held body fat analysis gadgets are more accurate than the scales. It is pretty accurate in terms of weight, but I've read that can be a little high too. If I could change my purchase I would have ordered the Omron Body Fat Analyzer, it's usually only about 3-4% higher. As always, the most accurate way to measure body fat is with calipers...if you can do it by yourself!"
4,Good home scale.,"Had this thing for 6 months now, no complaints. Seems accurate when comparing to the scale at the gym. 2 user settings feature is nice, and the body fat/water weight is cool as well. Body fat is kinda accurate, but aint gonna be as good as calipers. Too bad it doesn't come in other colors though to match bathroom decor."
5,"Reliable, Accurate, and Consistent","We have been using this scale for around 18 months without any issues. Spot on with other, more expensive, scales. I would purchase another if needed. Great value for the money."
4,"Great Song List, Great Sound Quality","For classic rock fans, this is a great album. I originally purchased for the sound quality aspect as it was played by someone that was selling high-end speakers. I asked what was playing and the guy was happy to demo a number of the songs on the disc. I loved it so I ordered my own. (I also bought the speakers which I still use in my main room)."
3,Decent for the Price,Color Stayed...Fit was great...Not very soft...Too thin - you can see the pattern of the mattress through it which looked terrible...Overall decent value but there are better sheets out there.
2,Go with Carter,These sheets are a nightmare to get on the mattress. The elastic is so stiff. Carters sheets are much softer and easier to put on.
5,A Necessary Luxury,"This Dermalogica product is a must in my collection. I have used it for years and I remain loyal. It is a fabulous, acid-free moisturizer. It it thick, emollient and soothing, even for sensitive skin, but never greasy. I use it over an exfoliating cream at night. My skin drinks it up."
2,Later Recordings,"This is an 8 song sampler of George Morgan's recordings from 1973 through 1975 when he was with Decca/MCA (five songs) and 4 Star (In the Misty Moonlight and the Lorrie Morgan duets).Morgan was always in good voice, and although the running time is way too short, this is a worthwhile collection to pick up if you are a big fan. Especially if you can find it for under $2.50."
1,Off To a Bad Start!,"I can't resist. While browsing (after being advised to buy The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation by Lynne Truss) I saw the title. Anyone who uses ""quote"" as a noun needs either a new editor or, preferably, a new education."
4,Great introduction to MTS and MSMQ,"If you are unfamiliar with MTS and MSMQ, this is a great introduction to both technologies. Once you've read this book, you'll understand the big picture and be ready to delve into the details. Good example code, and well written. It's a real page turner.Only minor quibble is a few minor production issues. For example, in my copy, there's a sticker on one page to cover up the typos!"
2,Good Material; Needs to be Update,"10-23-10I selected this book to use in an academic setting, teachinga student about Recruitment and Retention. The categories in thisbook are right on target. The problem is the copyright date - 2001.If I had it to do over I would not have selected this book ONLY becausesections of it are outdated.The chapter on Electronic Recruiting is showing its 10 year age. My suggestion:update the book including a major rework of Internet and electronic references. This handbok should be revised every three years.Scoop"
1,"Kids should be free, not programmed","This book aims at indoctrination, not education or enlightenment. I have only sympathy for those parents who believe this book will help them or their kids."
3,Nostalgia but with terrible sound,To tell you the truth I was looking forward to getting the Neil Diamond Live DVD from Australia. But the sound quality is bad and because of that I haven't watched it right though. I will one day.The audience sounds like they are in a tunnel and that becomes distracting. The original production was not particularly good. It is from 1976 and was a TV concert but this DVD release seems without any enhancement and is a wasted opportunity.
3,Bad Audio,"This dvd could have been something special but the audio is so bad that i can't even watch more than a few songs before i get tired of the terrible sound and turn it off, ND recently released a Hot August Night NYC (2008) dvd that has FAR superior audio - do yourself a favor and buy that dvd - not this one."
5,Grundig M100 Portable radio,"A great little radio. I used it on my flight from AZ to NH. The FM and AM came in just great. Not sure about the shortwave as I wasn't able to pick up anything. But then again, I didn't really try. I like the small size. Fits in my jacket pocket. A smart looking radio. Price is reasonable.CON: The ear plugs are useless. Will not stay in the ear."
4,Good for the price,"This is the only shirt pocket size shortwave radio worth buying. For this great price you get a pocket radio without any drift (meaning the station you listen to won't change to another station because of a loose or faulty dial), great stereo FM on headphones or ear buds (the buds that come with it are OK. Buy a better set and get ready for great sound), good AM reception, and Shortwave reception that is adequate for the big international broadcasts like BBC but poor for most everything else. The speaker is only good for talk radio. For music, this is a tinny and tiny speaker (about one inch wide). If you want a pocket radio that also gets BBC, Radio Canada, and Voice of America, this is the trick. Listen in on good earplugs and you will be happy with your purchase. It also has a good vinyl case. The radio looks sturdily built and will probably last for years."
4,A true gem,"Lost Eden is a game that, unfortunately, hasn't aged well. It's gameplay is indeed simplistic and the graphics, described by a ten-year-old me as being ""better than MYST,"" would seem crude by modern-day standards. However, it is nearly impossible to find a more immersive game circa 1995, with the possible exception of the aforementioned MYST, and literally impossible to find one with a better soundtrack than the one composed by Stephane Picq in Lost Eden. The bottom line is that this is a game that could scare little kids in its day (myself included) and that appealed to adults, I heard about it from my uncle, which is something that games today don't do as successfully."
5,Pretty!!!,"Estoy muy contenta con set de ollas que compramos, son muy lindas y llegaron en excelentes condiciones y muy rapido... Espero que la calidad sea tan buena como la presentación... tengo poco tiempo con ellas y por ahora todo esta perfecto."
5,Great Product,This is a great product for an unbeatable price. I will recommend this to everybody. I am very happy with what I received.
2,"Loved set, but time has ruined it!","I still use this set, although am greatly disappointed in it. It cooks nice, cleans beautifully, even when something burns. However, every single one of my pans/pots has warped. None of the lids fit on correctly. I have not put them in the dishwasher, so I don't know what caused the problem."
2,Not that great,"I expected more from kitchen aid. They are ok but not as non stick or as heavy as I was expecting. The pans I tossed out were about 10 years old with little non stick surface left but were almost as non stick as this new set of Kitchen aid. My old set was probably twice as thick and heavy. Love my kitchen aid mixer. I dont think I would buy another set. I would recomend going to a store and seeing this item in person before you buy and, everybody is right. It comes in the mail in the Kitchen aid box for everybody to see."
4,pots are fine but amazon lied,"these are NOT dishwasher safe, despite what the product description states."
4,"So far, so good - durable, but not dishwasher safe","I've had this set about two months so far. I was initially worried about the set not being dishwasher safe, but so far, the nonstick coating has made clean up a snap! These are also much thicker and heavier than I anticipated. They have a good weight to them and seem to heat fairly evenly. As I said - so far, so good. Really happy with them."
3,Not bad,"The rack system does look nice. Shelves are very stable. 1 issue like others mentioned it does move left and right ( Unless I forgot something.)You will have to mount it to a single wall stud . I had to come up with another way since the location I wanted fell between to studs.For the price it does what its supposed to do, hold my AV equipment."
1,http://www.amazon.com/Flo-Go-08339-SuperFlo-Pump/dp/B000JFI882/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top,"Used it 4 times and it started to leak inside the handle. It was good while it lasted, but it didn't last. I will try to get a refund or a replacement from the manufacturer.I tried to use the original product again and the nozzle completely broke off where the nozzle meets the gray plastic housing. I sure hope the replacement is much better than the original.I have contacted the manufacturer and they are going to replace the Flo N Go under warranty. I will amend the product review if the replacement unit lasts longer than the original."
1,Stay away!,Spouts keep breaking. Very poor design! Plastic is too thin where nozzle is formed into handle. I have purchased 5 of these and every one of these have broken. I don't put pressure on them. The company was nice to replace them for me but now I have to purchase additional polypropylene glue to add strength to them so they won't break.
2,worked for a while,"really liked it at first just what I needed but in Oct. it started leaking at the seam so now it is useless, and it wasn't cheap but all I could afford w/o a job for 3 yrs trying to save on gas. Now I'm stuck as it is way passed 30 days but it did work great for 6months"
3,The Saxaphone of Doom!,"One does eventually tire of Dalek stories when watching Doctor Who. This, however, is probably the best of the three Pertwee Dalek adventures, none of which were as good as the Troughtin or Tom Baker era stories.Season 11 in general was an improvement over the few before it with the addition of Sarah Jane, arguably one of the best companions in the series. The story itself is a little lacking in excitement until the end where the Doctor and Sarah must solve the puzzles (not very complicated ones) of the lost city of the Exxilons.The Daleks themselves try hard to stay in charachter even while their guns have been deactivated. Their lack of firepower has often been cited as the reason for the use of the Dalek theme music in this story. Often called ""The Saxaphone of Doom"" by fans, this gets very annoying and does not seem to fit with the menace of the Daleks.This is an average story which only a completist or a huge fan of the Daleks should bother adding to their collection."
2,NOT A REVIEW...A QUESTION,It's a shockmount for a microphone. Can someone explain why it's nearly $250?!! Is it because this is supposedly the ONLY shockmount that will fit the Blue Yeti mic? I didn't even pay $250 for the mic itself!Crazy!...Please explain.
5,good,very nice boyfriend loved it i love it cause i can hide it from dcf lol... it did get damaged on its way over to me but the return dept was very nice and i give them a A+
4,Gun Clock review,"Found the clock to be just as advertised. Plenty of room for a revolver or semi. I did upgrade the anchors that came with the clock. The ones you get are a bit small. Overall, it was a good deal for the money and I would buy it again if I needed another one."
3,Not any different from my stock seat.,I bought this to replace a Bontrager Evoke 1 that came with my Trek Fuel. After about 20 miles of riding I am as numb as I was with my Evoke saddle. I have tried different positions but no real difference between this and my old saddle. I guess I will be returning it. (Btw I am only 170lbs.)
3,Image is different than what you will receive,"The image is outdated (update: looks like they finally updated the image), and you should receive the newest version with vinyl top (shown). Build quality is good. I didn't know just how flexible the two halves are. The two halves are split down the middle and offer flexibility to adjust to your sit bones. I feel the seat is about the same as my Specialized BG seat that I am coming off of. Still had numbing after a 15 mile seated MTB ride/climb, but hopefully over time the seat will wear in a little more."
1,Nice idea but breaks quickly,"I have had two of these now because the first one stopped ratcheting after only about 2-3 weeks. They immediately sent me a replacement one, which stopped working after 4 weeks. I will never order again. I love the idea and the execution when working, but clearly it is not made to last more than a month!"
1,Poor quality,"I bought the Kamenstein Paper Towel Holder and for one week it was wonderful. However, as another reviewer noted, the ratchet mechanism soon broke and it no longer functioned properly so that it was impossible to tear off paper towels with one hand. Unfortunately, I was so happy the first week that I ordered 3 more for family members. When the package arrived, it was poorly packed (also noted by others) and two of the three units were broken. One had a stem that wobbled and the other already had a malfunctioning ratchet system. Overall, the quality of this product is very poor and you should definitely look at alternatives."
2,Looks good but mine dint last,"Looks good and was happy when I got it, but the plastic fastener at the bottom broke the second time I changed the roll. Might have just got a defective product."
3,Kamenstein 4536 Perfect Tear Paper Towel Holder,I find that there is too much resistance when pulling out off ofroll. Would be nice if tension was adjustable.
3,Paper Holder Doesn't Perform as Advertised,"This paper towel holder has many good points including a weighted base and a racheted spindle, however, it doesn't really work as advertised. About half the time the towel does not tear at the perforations and usually I need both hands to tear off just one piece. And then there are some days when it works perfectly. Go figure."
1,"neat idea, weak design","I have used this holder for a couple years now and I am finally replacing it. From day one, the spindle has constanly come lose. There is only one tiny little nut that holds the whole thing together, and it doesn't do the job. Every now and then you need to take out a nut driver and tighten it. And even when it is tight, the spindle still wobbles."
3,{So-So},"As a Pulse fan, I have accepted every artistic shift this band has gone through. They still rock live, and will always be tops. With that said, this is not one of their best offerings. It is somewhat scattered and doesn't flow as well as some other work. The dancehall seems a little forced and becomes more of a distraction than a benefit, although the message and lyrics are very positive.I did enjoy ""Bootstraps,"" ""Back To My Roots,"" and ""Better Days,"" but most of the other material didn't do much for me. Vex isn't bad, I just wouldn't make it my first Steel Pulse purchase. Try True Democracy or even Smash Hits."
4,Every person should read this book.,This book serves as an excellent trade book for Social Studies classrooms. It is well researched and serves as an important view of the effects of the atomic bomb reagrdless of the reader's personal beliefs of the bomb. Easily read in a week of 45 minute classes.
3,Not an adequate reference for expanding businesses,"As the bookkeeper for a start up internet company, QB for Dummies was helpful as a quick tutorial and overview. If you run a small family business, this is the perfect book for you. But if you're a company that expects to grow (as many of us startups are hopeful of), there's just not enough detail. I am now forced to look for a different book that will give me detailed help in creating the reports I need for financial analysis. Good thing I was given this one for free..."
1,BLAH!!!!,"This book sucked and didn't help me at all. Yeah, maybe if I would have read every page front to back I might have understood this program a little more. But who has time for that? And who wants to read a reference book anyway? I got it so I could reference it when I was having trouble with quickbooks. You can figure a lot of the program on your on; but it's the details that are lacking in this book and it's the details you want. I ended up hiring a contractor to come in and teach me the program."
1,Parochial documentary,F**k s**ks. This is a boring pseudo documentary that is much more interested in bashing Bush and other right wing nut jobs than discussing the word itself. It also seems to believe the word only exists in the United States so aside from Billy Connolly every other guest here is an American.
3,Hit or miss,"""Knit N Style"" has been around for a long time--I remember picking it up when I first began knitting seriously several decades ago. It has some nice patterns, but overall I find it the least useful of the major knitting magazines. I don't know about its current policies, but it used to be a vehicle by which the yarn manufacturers promoted their wares. On numerous occasions, the patterns published in ""Knit N Style"" were pattterns previously published as leaflets by the manufacturer of the yarn suggested. I don't know if this continues to be their policy, and they have made attempts to upgrade the editorial content with informational features. Nonetheless the magazine's quality remains lower than that of Knitters, Vogue Knitting, etc. My advice is to check it out at the newstand and if you see a pattern you like, then buy it."
3,As good as it gets,"RoboCop is a good game to play, it is dated, so don't expect the graphic or game play to be Crysis."
2,ROBO COP SUX 80 PERCENT,"This game has nothing to do with Robots and Cops. Besides, Robots and Cops do not mix. Plus, if it's a game, then it's a bad game. I hate getting taken by cops and I hate kiddish robot toys. And this is a flawy game."
4,if you want know,"IF YOU REALLY WANT TO IDENTIFY YOUR ANTIQUE SILVER, THIS BOOK IS EASY TO USE AND HAS SO MUCH INFO."
2,"Poor, even for the great Baker","I am a great fan of this creepy era of the show but really. I mean come on the Doctor and friends only have to contend with two or three cyberman. The story is also weak. I recommend this for the collector completing his or her collection, but not for the Doctor Who novice. For the novice I would recommend Robots of Death, The Talons of Weng-Chieng, or Pyramid of Mars."
5,One of the best Cyberman stories.,"The Doctor and his companions return from Skaro after 'Genesis of the Daleks' to Nerva Beacon, which is in isolation due to a mysterious plague. Before long the remains of the Cyberman army is on the scene.This is a well-written and interesting story - it is here that we discover the effect gold has on the Cybermen, who are at their menacing best. The characters are well-thought-out, there are some memorable scenes, the cybermats are finally creepy rather than comical and there is a nice doom-laden soundtrack. Seeing the Doctor arriving in the past of a location he visited in a previous story is also an interesting idea."
5,Tom Baker's First Year,"Purchasing this episode is part of my long term project of buying all of the Tom Baker years. I started from his first season and will be moving forward. This episode was very good. The Tom's 1st Season did have a story line, both Sara Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan were his companions. This season centered around the Doctor attempts to find his missing Taudis, which he lost at the end of the second episode Arc in Space. I now own all of 74-75 and it was a great season."
5,What a great read!,"All I can say is WOW. I finished this adventure tale in two readings. Lila Pinord's writing style is so descriptive that I found myself watching the story unfold from within the covers of the book. I felt that I was walking, talking and walking with the characters as well as sharing their fears, anguish and joys. I actually feared the morbid behaviour of serial killer Charlie Crane throughout the entire novel. The ending was spun with adventurous twists and dangers that lurked behind every bend. I'm ashamed to admit this, but I actually shed a tear at the warm family ending. After reading this suspenseful tale, it will be a long, long time before I walk in the woods alone or enter a cave again."
4,Very cool,"This is the second best game for xbox for me (my opinion) but the best game is Roller coster tycoon for xbox.My the images i have seen from different website,i got so attractive to it.I went to the nearest mall from my place.They actually have the demo and it is so kewl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,ONLY FUN FOR 2 DAYS,THIS GAME WILL GET VERY OLD AFTER 2 DAYS OF PLAYIN. ONLY RENT THIS GAME. BEST PART SHOOTING A SNIPER RIFFLE OUT THE HELICOPTER AT MOVIN TARGETS. BUT YOU CAN'T KILL THE PEOPLE IN THE PARK... ITS COOL TO WHEN A TWISTER COMES AND TWIRLS THE PEOPLE UP IN THE AIR. THATS IT. I WANT A GAME WERE I KILL THE DINOSAURS AND DON'T SAY TUROK! :(

3,"Decent Performance, not great design","This is the first web cam I have used, so I don't have a baseline for what type of performance to expect. That being said, it delivers a good picture and it was very simple to setup, no drivers even needed for my XP setup. Word of caution, don't use the built in microphone if you already have one installed on your machine. I agree with the other review that commented on the un-sturdy base. Conversly, I did not have the problems with installing the camera."
2,This is not Real Celtic Music!,"The performances are not bad on this DVD, however it does dissapoint if you're seeking really traditional Irish music. Most of this sounds like 60sFolk Rock. Where are some good Irish Tenors when you need them? All you have here is Rock musicians trying their best to strain out semi Irish tunes with a Rock beat. Not horrible, but definitely not ""Gaelic"" spirit."
4,not bad tasting,Very fast delivery and packaged well. Trying to improve my immune system with winter coming on and working with children..
3,Safety and Efficacy of the Oil,"Several months ago, my friend told me that Cod liver oil will increase my immune system and may reduce the stuffy nose problem. I bought the oil made by Carlson, as it had the most reviews in Amazon. I started to take it everyday since 21 Feb 2011. I don't see anything changed (by 20 Mar 2011). I still have to take decongestant pill every night. On the bottle of oil, it claims that the product is regularly tested for freshness, potency and purity by an independent FDA-registered lab and has been determined to be fresh, fully potent and free of mercury, cadmium, PCB and 28 other contaminants. I am hoping Carlson would post most recent test results regularly in its website or other place. I will update the review, when I notice the improvement of immune system."
4,Concentrated lemon flavor,"The taste and smell of lemons overwhelms my smoothie when I mix it in, so I prefer to take a tablespoon of the oil by itself. It tastes much better than how I imagine cod liver oil by itself tastes. But it is very strong still of lemons."
4,supplement following knee surgery,"i recently had ACL surgery on my knee and was looking for a supplement to help me heal up faster. being rich in omega 3 i went for the fish oil (i prefer the liquid vs the gel caps). Carlson is great, i do not have any complaints, tastes great. i cant really compare it to anything else because i had taken the gel caps before but i don't think they are absorbed as well by the body as the liquid directly."
3,Missed concept?,"Do not own, nor have I used them yet (hence the middle-of-road review). That said: Is it just me, or did someone at Oakley completely miss the point? They should NOT have jammed another limited-purpose MP3 player into a place it didn't belong.Instead, on seeing the ads & marketting, I was hoping they'd have made nothing more/less than a Bluetooth headset integrated with their shades, paired with a small transmitter to attach to whatever MP3 device people already had. Throw your Zen or iPod into your pocket/armband/whatever, and then go. That way, Oakley would have stayed above the format/platform bickering and brought a truly innovative product to market that ALL MP3 listeners could benefit from. Hard-drive jukeboxes, flash-based USB-keys, PSP's and GameBoys, ANYTHING with a headphone jack could have been serviced by this product..."
4,Best AGP card on the market,"This card is the best AGP card on the market, thats not an exaggeration, AGP cards are the old version, and honestly, they are very limited. This card is the best graphics card that you can get for a computer that only has AGP ports (i think the computer would have to be 3, maybe 4 years or older, when AGP was the standard). It can handle any game, and comes with DVI and VGA ports. This is the best product if your computer is older only has AGP."
2,There are better options out there...,"I bought this book as a holiday gift for my brother and there is no way I can give this to him. The book looks like an arts and craft project bound in a plastic binding comb. The ""book"" is very flimsy and not very presentable. There are so many other books out there that offer the same level of pizza expertise as well as a beautifully presented book. All I have to say is consider your options!"
4,Great information....,"Just made his buffalo chicken pizza at work, wow and fantastic was the common response to this great recipe."
5,By far the best pizza book ever!,"While this book does contain recipes, the primary focus is on the ""art"" of making pizza. Everything from the correct type of flour to use to kitchen tools to help you bake it. Even if you only learn one tip from this book, it will by far improve the pizza you make. Since I got this book I've been making a pizza every week, trying different hints and suggestions from this book, and every week my pizza gets better! A must have for anyone who loves pizza!"
3,Good game but very annoying,"I read the synopis of the game and it sounded good. Boy was I wrong! This game totally blows. My eyes get tired of trying to find where to go after a few trys. Without a map on screen while playing, its not much of a game. The area is all dark, so you cant tell where you are going. After learning how to play, it was still boring and I just gave up on it. I felt bad because I shelled out 20 bucks for this game, and its not even great as people say. Maybe ill learn to like it, but my eyes will have to adjust to the screen first."
4,Good Science,"The author stays focused on the evidence and he is balanced in weighing the evidence in drawing conclusions. If a reader has an interest in mass extinctions and what is their most likely cause then this is a must read book. It is possible the best book on the subject. The author covers the topics well, perhaps just a little bit too much for my interest. The author does a lot of name dropping of the geologists working on these controversial topics; this is good if the reader knows these geologists, but otherwise these parts tend to be a bit dry. Because I lost interest a few times once I got the point I found myself skipping some sections, as so I gave it four stars instead of five. My intent is to go back and read it again a couple of times."
1,Out of touch with reality,"This book lacks erudition, other than quoting certain passages out of the Bible out of context. However, if you want to learn what the Bible says, you're better off reading the Bible, right? In any case, this book was interesting as a showcase piece of how a blinkered mind can justify Bush's acts of terrorism."
2,funny if you live here,I live literally on the same road as some of the scenes. This movie has pathetic graphics and is amusing for those of us in the Quad Cities where it was filmed. Mountains edited into the background in the great plains. I even know the guy driving the RV at the end. I got it simply for the amusing scenes of my town falling apart.
3,"It ok, but nothing great","We start in the hills of West Virginia where Charley ""Boomer"" Baxter (Eriq LaSalle) is blasting a mountain. By accident, Baxter set off a masssive earthquake that is felt as away as Washington D.C. were Dr. Amy Lane (Brittany Mruhpyy)is with her fmaily. Within a giant Megafault is created that is racing across the country, leaving death in it wake. With the help of Dr. Mark Rhodes (Bruce Davidson) and serect miltary weapon that came create earthquakes, Lane and Baxter race to the stop the megafualt before it hits Califoria.""Megafualt"" is not a great movie but really not that bad. The writers have all the usual things that you expect to. One person that is right while everyone else is wrong, cute kid, the one character that you know will be dead before it over, the miltary that is either the cause of the problem or has the secret weapon to save the day. Overall Megafault is the type of movie that Syfy puts out and you may just want to rent it instead of buying it."
3,Entertaining,"Some disaster flicks are better than others, but Megafault isn't awesome nor is it a total pile of doo. The special effects are entertaining enough, though don't hold your breath for scientific accuracy or a coherent plot, some of the plot holes are laughable. The acting is decent, and while I've seen better disaster flicks, I've also seen worse. This movie is decent for a TV movie, and is good for easy entertainment. Brittany Murphy's not bad in this film. A rather appropriate film for the 'Syfy' name, ok for a boring afternoon or the like.(Edit - RIP Brittany Murphy)"
4,I've finally watched my first Doctor Who show...,"I have avoided this program like the plague most of my life, and now I found that I've been mistaken.I remember seeing bit of this show on PBS and it just looked so cheesy that I could not bring myselt to watch it.On a whim, I took Doctor Who-The Robots of Death out of the local library and I really enjoyed it. The story was good. The acting not bad. The script had some silly lines, but all in all it was a good viewing experience.I don't expect to turn into a Doctor Who fanatic this late in life, but I can certainly see myself checking other episodes out of the library."

3,Expected more from this game,"I like the idea behind this game, however I thought they came up short by all the limits the game imposes on you. As well as the limits to what can be built."
1,Swann SW-P-HGA Wireless Network Booster,"Did nothing to improve my indoor reception,don't waste your money."
3,I don't know how much differance it makes.,picture still comes in a little fuzzy. I'm not sure the booster makes any differance
1,disappointed,We ordred this product but ended up receiving a refund. We are happy that the seller didn't send us a messed up product tho.
1,Don't waste your cash,"I have a Sony VAIO R505 SuperSlim notebook. It's a great notebook. However, I would never buy this matching wireless LAN card. It may work great and match the color of my notebook, but the PRICE! You can get other wireless LAN cards for half the price, and they work equally well.Don't be tricked into thinking you need a Sony card just because you have a Sony computer. The Linksys and D-Link cards work just as well for half the cash. I use the Linksys WPC11 card, and I got it for 60 bucks."
5,Doc Who,Great Doc Who movie! I really enjoy the movie! It follows the tradition of Doc Who. The foundation that it was built on!
3,"A bit duller than many other episodes, but still fun moments","John Pertwee is fun to watch and is one of the livelier actors to play the Doctor. However, this episode takes a while to get going and is slow at times, even for Dr. Who. It is good goofy fun like most Dr. Who, but it is not the most exciting episode and I've seen other Pertwee episodes that should have been on DVD ahead of this one. Dr. Who fans will still enjoy it, but if you're looking for your first Dr. Who episode to buy, try The Ark In Space or Tomb Of The Cybermen first."
2,Shock,"I have read other Robin Cook books, and, without going back to re-read them, I must say I don't recall the writing being as pedestrian or the dialogue as stilted as it is in this effort. The risks taken by the two female protagonists aren't very believable, but I'll admit to being unable to put the book down as the bizarre events unfold. The ending was unsatisfying. It seemed as though the last page should have ended with ""To be continued..."""
2,Will someone pleaseexplain the end?,Did the girls get caught by the doctors or saved by the law enforcement? Please tell me.
1,Robin Cook Shock,"I have always enjoyed Mr. Cooks medical mysteries. To say that I was greatly disappointed in this, his latest, is an understatement. The field of cloning is both repellent and fascinating, but in this book is it just trite. You are never involved with the characters or truly care what happens to them. The plot is so convoluted it nevers really gets off the ground. I am used to Mr. Cooks timely build up to an exciting end. In this book it just ends. I kept turning the end pages to see if I had missed the last chapter. The only thing I can think of is that Mr. Cook needed the money and just wrote until he got tired and then stopped. His editor should be fired! Who ever edited this book was a ... ! This is the last book I will ever buy from Mr. Cook, having been suckered one time too many from my favorite authors in the past six months. All I can say is ""Buyer Beware"", this book is a stinker!"
4,never miss a Robin Cook book,"I read ALL his books along the years..And I read them over again. That one is a good one: solid, entertaining and captivating. Robin Cook is the best medical thriller author !"
1,"Get to the point, stat!","I've read backs of cereal boxes that are more engaging. The book's motto is apparently: why say in one sentence what you can say in 15 bloated, flabby paragraphs. The action chugs along like molasses on a cold day. Note how many times the word ""appropriate"" appears. I'm listening to the book on CD checked out from the library. You could make a drinking game out of how many times that word is used. It's the most dull, flat, listless writing I've encountered in a while. The only ""Shock"" so far is that this is apparently the work of a best-selling author."
2,Not a complete waste,"This can be a fun read, if you are willing to suspend belief for most of the book. It has its thrilling parts (espionage, chase scenes, etc.) it's just not all that believable.In summery, two young women working on their doctoral theses respond to a newspaper ad in a campus newspaper for egg donors. The infertility clinic is offering an unbelievable amount of money for the donations. You know what they say about something that seems to be too good to be true? Well apparently these Harvard educated girls have never heard that saying. The rest of the book goes on to show what the infertility clinic is really up to. Unfortunately, the plot has to rely on the stupidity of the girls to make it work. I don't think Robin could come up with a plausible ending for the story, so he just ended it anyway.It wasn't a complete waste of time though, I enjoyed parts of it and it isn't all that long."
2,Almost good,"I've not read a lot of Cook's books. I immediately noticed the dialogue was babyish and very non-conversational. I thought I was reading a Nancy Drew book. The idea that these Ivy league girls would commit a felony to find out about their donated eggs is stupid and insulting to the reader. The non-ending is annoying also, but I understand writers like to allow the reader to decide what happened. So, I did not take off points for the ending. I did like the understated humor, but it much needed more of it."
2,Uninspired at best,"One of the very first novels I read was Coma by the same author. And I loved it. I even got my sister hooked on him. However, I have to agree with many of the reviews on this list. My biggest complaint about this book is how fake the dialogue is between the characters. The action sequences (or lack thereof) slightly builds and never finishes. The psychological aspects of what the characters had to go through don't have any realism. Sad to say that although this book is very simply written and easy to understand and follow, it contains a rather predictable plot. Moreover, cloning has such broad implications that to waste it by focusing on the Wingate clinic and its facilities and security system is shameful.I really hope the next novel I read by this author doesn't fall into the same pitfalls this one does."
1,The Shock was how much time was wasted for a poor ending,"While the story wasn't the greatest, I as the reader/listener really got to know its 2 heroes. These women were likable even if their situations were laughable. At points the plot was predictible. But after hours of dialogue, medical terms and wise cracks, Cook betrayed his readers by not knowing how to end the book.So what happened to each of the players is the question and do the bad guys really get away with murder?What a wasted investment of time. Luckily it wasn't a financial waste since I borrowed the book from the public library."
1,Surely Robin Cook Wasn't Serious,"I have read 1/2 of Shock... and that is enough for me. If you're considering buying this book, pick up a Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew mystery book - it will probably be more compelling. Trust me on this one... actually, trust ALL of the reviewers; they ALL said the same thing."
2,Shock,"I am an avid reader of Robin Cook, but I've never felt like I've wasted so much time in my life with reading this book. I couldn't put it down, yet when I got to the end I was flabbergasted! How can you just stop a book without an ending??? I'm not sure I'll read any more of his books."
1,Keeps getting worse,"The one good thing about this book is that Toxin is no longer the worst book Robin Cook has ever written. ""Shock"" is even worse. The dialogue is ridiculous and infantile, there is absolutely no suspense, and the ending looks as if he just ran out of ink and stopped. What happened to Robin Cook? Is there an impostor out there writing for him?"
3,Quick reading,I'll admit that the plot was a little out there but I did not have trouble keeping interested in it. I have read better but I still thought this book was entertaining.
1,The worst Robin Cook novel ever,"One of the worst novels I've read (and definitely the worst Robin Cook novel). A good premise, but it reads like Mr. Cook phoned this one in (or had a ghost writer?).Skip this one."
4,He's done it again.,"I took a break from reading Robin Cook for a while because some of the books became a little 'far fetched'. I was delighted to begin reading his books again when I picked up Shock. Right from the beginning I knew this was going to be a real 'page-turner'. This time, he's back writing a suspenseful tale. Two Harvard grads are in danger as they seek to uncover the truth about a wealthy fertiliy clinic they visited. You will not be disappointed if you read this one!"
1,Where's the passion?,"When I compare this book to one of my all-time favorite thrillers, ""Fever"" by the same author, I go into SHOCK. Robin Cook just doesn't care any more."
2,"Interesting story, but where's the ending?","I have read the other reviews and I must come to Robin Cook's defense. Not all his books are as bad as this. It isn't even that the book is bad. Sure, the story is fishy, but hey, it is just a story after all. If you want nonfiction, find a different author. But I must say, I put a lot of effort into this book to get to the end without putting it away, only to be confronted with an ending that wasn't there. I feel cheated. Should Robin Cook put out a sequel, I WILL NOT read it."
3,Medical Ethics vs Blatant Greed,"The essence of a good story about modern medicine and opportunities for it to go in the wrong direction. One too many mishaps for these supposedly well educated women as they delve further and further into medical corruption, deceit, and greed. Pushes one to explore the moral dilemma's created by technological advances in medicine."
2,Robin Cook's new book just misses the mark.,"I was delighted to find his new novel...at least until I read it. The book has all the elements to be a fine read, but slows down in mid way point. If the author would have only added another thirty pages to the ending, it would have helped to make a more solid climax to the plot."
1,Disappointing,"I've read several of Robin Cook's books, and this one is sadly disappointing. Often clinically inaccurate, it just drones on and on from page to page. The characters are flat, the premise unlikely to say the least.It comes across as somewhat condescending, too - not something I appreciate in a novel.Ultimately, not one on which to spend your hard-earned cash - save this book for next time you're at the free library, if you really want to give it a chance."
1,Apparently everyone agrees...,"I couldn't believe how bad this book is! My friends and family had to listen to me rant about the poor writing, the strange sentence structure and the boring boring detail - as if the author was compelled to write a certain number of pages per day or else! Robin Cook should just give up writing if this crummy story is the best he can do. I finally gave up when Joanna went on and on about her missing ovary. When it becomes laborious to read a novel - I quit. There isn't enough time in my life to waste on this drivel."
2,A copy of a copy of a copy,"I really liked Coma. It established Robin Cook as a popular writer. Problem is: Shock seems to be the a pale imitation of his best book. Nothing changes. Two women--again students--take on a shadowy fertility clinic which a such a cliche' that you know absolutely will be a surprise when the deep, dark secret is divulged. The dialog is so weak, one wonders if anyone actually talks like that in real life. True to character the two Nancy Drews con their way into this diabolical organization to save the day. Some time Cook will have to have two middle aged medical directors delve into the workings of a sinister college sorority. The scene with the stolen eggs and ovaries, straight from Coma again. And the ending, go to the Public Library and save your money, it really is extremely lame."
4,An imaginary friend causes a little trouble...,"My daughter has a herd of imaginary friends, so she and I both enjoyed this book. Imaginary friend Ted arrives for a visit to a small boy, he wreaks havoc much to the consternation of the boy's father. But in the end, Ted helps teach dad a lesson in having fun.The illustrations are well detailed, though Ted looked a little bit....well, almost scary looking. The boy resembles Harry Potter.Overall, I'd recommend this book."
2,Company LIED that this would have Japanese audio.,"I ordered this before the release for my kids. They are bilingual Japanese and were expecting it to be in Japanese as the company promised. Now that the video has been released the ad has been changed to say English only. What a scam. Would it have been so hard to include both an English and a Japanese audio track like with all the Miyazaki movies? Now I have to return it and buy it here in Japan, (where it costs twice as much). What a waste of time. Thanks, Viz."
5,Great product,"I needed a baby proof table cover that git my personal style, and this is it. I love it and will buy more."
1,Frumpy and Ugly,"This did not lay smooth and flat like the picture and was really, really ugly and fake looking. Sending back pronto!"
1,Not Worth It,"The item arrived damaged so I really did not give it a try. However, after reading the instructions and warnings I'm glad I didn't use it! I prefer Toppik which is easier to apply and more natural in its appearance."
2,Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep,"The scale works great, the body fat is as repeatable as can be expected from a scale. But the scale BEEPS and you cant mute it. To take a complete measurement it beeps when you turn it on, beeps when it is ready for you to step on the scale, beeps when it gets weight, beeps twice when it gets bodyfat and twice more when it gets water. SEVEN beeps. Not terribly loud but piercing. I am an early riser and like to weigh first thing in the morning, but the glares I got from my spouse after being awoken by the beeps may require me returning the product. He is a heavy sleeper and often sleeps through his alarm, but this scale in the bathroom with a closed door woke him up."
2,Weigh with caution,"I purchased the scale because of favorable reviews. The difficulty I encountered with the scale is that on a tile floor it slides and is even hard to get on. I feel the reason for this is that the little round corner disks that the scale stands on are plastic and smooth; thus, causing the scale to slide when you use it. I contacted the company, they checked the model and agreed with me and said they would make a note of it. Because the scale is not steady, it is hard to get a reliable and constant reading thus defeating the purpose of the scale. If the situation was corrected, the scale would probably be okay; but, now I would use it, if at all, only with extreme caution"
5,Great Scale,"I owned a Tanita scale before and was quite pleased with it as it seemed to be accurate when I would weight myself on other reliable scales. Before purchasing this one, I did my research on other scales as well as this model and decided if ""it ain't broke, don't fix it"". I am glad to say that I am very satisfied with this one also. As I don't know my exact fat content, I can't say if it right on in that area but it sounds reasonable. I am not sure as to the body water ratio either as I haven't had that checked by a doctor, but that too measures in the area it should be for my height, weight and age. I recommend this product."
2,Not quite what I was looking for,"I wanted a small, pocket-sized scientific calculator like the Casio I previously had but that got smashed when I dropped it one day. This one had the same part number but was much more bulky and clunky. It won't even fit in most of my work dress shirt pockets! Most disappointing. Functionally it works just fine; just not practical for my pockets."
5,YAGMCH is the best,"Your a good man charlie brown is the best musical ever and I'm obsessed with it. I wish I could see it but it unfortunely it closed and I could'nt see it But this is the best book I've found but it doesn't have ""Beetoven Day""."
5,Great for long distance FM reception,"I purchased this radio in an attempt to receive a distant FM station. The transmitter is 76 miles from my house, and is in the noncommercial band (88-92 MHZ) which is rather crowded in my area. I am using a directional antenna in my attic, and the station comes in perfectly! This one does better than any FM radio I own. I do not find the bass to be excessive, but I have it about 4"" away from the wall on my piano. This is one radio purchase that has proven to be better than expected!"
2,Very thin slices,"The julienne slicer works to make perhaps garnish for a salad. I was using it with carrots and the slices come out super thin. Unless I don't plan to cook with carrots, or add them in the end, this gadget will collect dust in my kitchen."
3,But does it last?,"I had high hopes for this little gadget. Yet I stand before you today with some sad news.The good news is that she is a sharp little thing. And the safety handle works better than average in my experience.But in less than 2 years by pet looks like a rather sad jack-o-lantern with all of those missing teeth.But on the right hand half, it can still cut those skinny little carrot strips for salads [which I love] and garlic is good. It is definitely go0d with the harder vegetables. I like my onions diced a little larger and only tried an onion once. Still, I use it every couple of weeks, but with the decision to make over again, I think that I would settle for something either much cheaper or more versatile."
4,Also makes Julenne fries!,"Read the safety information on this! Julienned finger tips are not pleasant! Lesson learned. With that said, this rocks. I looked at a bunch of other mandolins prior to buying the Kyocera Julienne slicer and the double edge slicer. I settled on two items instead of one that has multiple blades and I haven't been sorry. If you want vegtaibles to look like a million bucks when chopped up this is the tool. Beautiful little strips of carrot, zucchini, potato, apple, everything. It is just so cool. Buy it, you won't be sorry. It rocks."
4,What has happened to Leaders?,"While the condition of the U.S. economy, and the lack of a manufacturing base in the U.S. are not 100% the responsibility of the CEO, I do agree with the author. Rather than point out his mistakes, as one reviewer successfully didm, I would call on all of us to look at the condition of our economy, our government, and even our world, and do something about it. Do anything. These are all problems that can be solved by one person alone. But if a group of high-profile CEOs decided to forego the instant millions of dollars, truly look long-term, and challenge all other CEO, and Boards of Directors to do the same, there may well be a chance."
2,Not the greatest toy bar,"I received this as a gift when my second daughter was born. My older daughter LOVES it b/c she recognizes the toy and the songs from her DVD's. However...I have to unhook and rehook it everytime I want to put my daughter in or take her out of her car seat. It's not difficult, just annoying.MAIN COMPLAINT: SONG IS WAY WAY TOO SHORT!!!I would start the song, and our daughter would settle down JUST in time for the song to stop. And, it's so hard to reach when in the car!I read in other reviews that it doesn't fit on Graco snug fit carseats, but it fits fine on ours."
3,2 angels mom,"I absolutely loved this item when I saw it in the store but once I got it home and on his carrier i was a little dissapointed. It is extremely loud and doesn't have volume control and it has to be taken off of the seat everytime you put the baby in or take them out. Also, the little creatures inside get stuck together which is a little aggrivating. I love Baby Einstein products but this one didn't impress me."
3,Baby enjoys it...,"Our little girl seems to enjoy looking at the water and fish. She really likes the music and becomes quiet when it's playing. Never had any problems with it leaking like I read on other reviews. Overall, we enjoy this carseat toy."
1,I agree! This is garbage!,"This seemed like a great idea in the packaging, but the ""critters"" inside don't move very well once the toy is attached to the carrier handle AND the music doesn't last nearly long enough. You also have to remove the thing to take Baby in and out of the carrier or he'll hit his head. This item is going back to the store!"
1,Disappointing,"I was not impressed with this product at all. The music only plays for about 20 seconds. The fish do not move. When the carrier handle is moved back in order to get our baby out, the toy sits too low and hits her in the forehead."
4,Loves it but music gets old.,My little one loves this toy. She is 10 months old and still likes to play with the beads and fish. The one draw back is the music. It doesn't change and it's short so you have to push the button again and again.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"We purchased this product one week ago. The water section leaks. And after contacting the manfacturer, this product contains a non-toxic chemical in the water which can cause skin irriation if it contacts the skin. Beware"
3,Too close to baby's face & the paint comes off...,"We thought this toy looked like a great idea, but when we attached it to our carrier it was too close to our son's face. He couldn't see it and the animals inside wouldn't move because it was so securely attached. He loves the music. We gave it to him to play with on the floor, but noticed the paint chipping off of the fish. We don't know if the chipped paint would hurt him, but we don't think a baby toy should have that problem. Overall, we like it but wish it were designed better."
3,Just OK,"I got this product for my son who doesn't seem to like any type of car ride. I was hoping this would help. The music only last a few seconds each time, and a small button needs to be pushed to have the music play each time. Unfortunately, while driving, it's not an option! My son did enjoy watching the colors and the things ""float"" in the water, but that's about it. He's already grown tired of this toy, and it's now sitting in a box in our attic. If you are looking for a toy for your child to play with or to keep entertained for longer stretches of time, I would suggest getting something that plays music a lot longer."
2,Leaks!,"My son loved this toy on his carrier. But, one week after we attached it to the car seat, it started leaking! I was so disappointed because my son really like the music, and especially pushing the beads back and fourth, and making them rattle.I also found myself constantly attaching it and removing it to be able to get him in and out of the carrier. While it was at a fine height with the carrier handle raised, it hit him in the face when the handle was moved back so that he could be put in or taken out of the seat.A really disappointing product from Baby Einstein. We love and own many of their other items."
3,Fish don't swim!,"On the package, it says that the sea creatures ""swim"" which is only true if I turn my daughter and the carrier on their side or take it off and shake it around for her.I've not had any problems with it leaking, but my daughter seems to watch in anticipation of the fish moving (like Fisher Prices' Ocean Wonders collection) and, instead, nothing happens. Also, the toy bar is too high for a baby her size (2 months) to reach any of the toys that dangle from it.She likes the music and since my baby sits behind me in my car, I can push the button to restart the music, but it's unfortunate that it's not more interactive. If I had it to do over again, I'd buy something that is more interactive to get her attention."
3,need some patience to sit through the whole ordeal,a bit repulsive when watched the corpse being cut open. it's funny to look those people in the movie didn't seem to be bothered by the stench of the corpse which should have been perished and rotten. definitely an overlook by the director. asking the little girl to be just a senseless soul in her own imaginary world and kept talking to herself was another awkward thing to be watched with patience. the little girl help her drug addicted father to shoot up is another disgusting sight i have to grind my teeth. i really don't know how to categorize this movie. any deeper meaning or hidden agenda for us to dig around and come up with more philosophic lessons? guess not. all i could find in my afterthought is that the little girl might turn out to be a psycho too.
2,Just Not There,"This movie brought up a lot of emotions. The main being boredom, confusion and disgust. Terry Gilliam claims in the beginning of this film to have found his inner child. If he has, it is a child that, between periods of utter neglect, went through some severe physical and emotional abuse. The camera work and visuals live up to Terry Gilliam standards, but the plot, alas, does not. Now, if you will excuse me, I'm off to watch Brazil to remember why I liked Giliam in the first place."
1,ugly film.,"this isn't your days of heaven by terrence malick, and if I hear anyone comparing this film to Pan's labryrinth besides some coincidental genre stuff, I'm gonna sue for slander because no one, and i mean no one should be suckered who was a big fan of Pan's Labryinth into watching this for some chance of that level of greatness. This isn't on that precipice of artwork, and terry gilliam seems like he has lost his mind to me. I was only freaked out by his introduction, rather that prepared, or whatever it was supposed to do. With what he was saying, I thought it was going to be some illegal dungeon porn stomp film. Nothing at all to justify his just crazy statement, ""there's a little girl inside me."" I had to tie my hands and feet to the ground to finish this film, and I did finish it because I have liked Terry in the past. His films are genuine and cannot be confused for anybody else's. This film is terrible."
2,Not my favorite,I enjoy Lindsay books very much. This is very well done but the content just wasn't to my liking. I am a history buff. I haven't cared much for Viking history. Much too vicious and raw for my taste. Lindsay does so well representing history and this book reflects that. I completed the book but chose not to read the second one. It is still a very well done Lindsay book.
1,Disappointing,Disappointed is an understatement... I truly regret buying this book... it's just horrible.The hero is a rapist while the heroine is stubborn and just exasperating. I finished reading it just because I didn't want to throw $8 away...
2,"Liked the story, but...","This is the first book of The Haardrad Trilogy.First let me start by saying that this story was disappointing. This book is not as great as Brenna's daughter, Kristen's story (sequel: Heart's Aflame). This is the story of Brenna and Garrick. They are separated more than they are together in the book, which is frustrating. I kept waiting for the romance or at least to see and feel that the couple were falling in love instead of being told about their feelings. I read Kristen's story first and from the ending, I thought Brenna and Garrick's love story would be equally or if not nearly as good as Hearts Aflame.The trilogy follows of Brenna & Garrick's two children, Selig and Kristen1st book- ""Fires of Winter"" The parents' story2nd book- ""Hearts Aflame"" Kristen's story *loved the best*3rd book- ""Surrender My Love"" Selig's story *liked this better than Fires of Winter*"
1,Didn't like it,"I don't know which one was worse: the hero or the heroine. The hero was a cruel, ruthless, horrible man. He wanted to have his way, no matter what. He forced the heroine - and not only once. And he wasn't even sorry for it. When it comes to the heroine, she was a spoiled, stubborn, horribly annoying brat! I could hardly stand her. And in the end, when she went to live in a cottage in the middle of the woods alone - and pregnant for something like 6 or 7 months - it was just sooo stupid. I don't know what either of them saw in the other. It was just horrible. All they did was fight. With words or with anything else that came handy. I could hardly finish this book."
2,Is this a joke?,"Whoever put this collection together should be fired! ""3 Cd's of Classic Disco Grooves"", it says - but that ain't what you get. Sure, there's some good stuff: Marlena Shaw's Love Dancin'; The Jacksons' Can You Feel It?; Phyllis Hyman's You Know How To Love Me; and Dan Hartman's Instant Reply.Good enough, but, and it's a big 'BUT', all 3 CD's are fluffed out with club tracks from 2006! Sorry, what was that? 2006, did you say? Yep, 2006. Some tracks are even mis-labled as being from the '70's and early '80's!Frankly, I'm mystified. In who's warped mind can house tracks from 2006 be classified as ""Classic Disco Grooves""? Some eejit obviously thought that 3 CD's looked better than 2, and that nobody would notice if they stuck a few house tracks in to fill 'em up. Fool!"
2,UK flag bandana,"disappointing - inferior material - smaller than I expected - would never order another , as this was part of a gift....."
4,Motorcycle Carrier Works Well,"I have a 250 Kawasaki Dual Sport that I load on to this carrier. The bike is about 75-100 lbs less than the carrying limit. The bike is relatively easy to load and take off, I can do it by my self, but that may not be true for everyone as I am a relatively tall person with circus like arms. The frame of the carrier shows some twisting as the bike is loaded onto the carrier. I am not sure if this is true with all carriers, but as there is only one central mounting point (the hitch) the shear physics of the weight on one side lead me to believe this would be the same on all carriers. The twisting goes away as soon as the bike is loaded on. It did not come with any tie down straps, but this was remedied with about 30 dollars in straps from the local true value. All in all I am very happy with the way this carrier performs and I recommend it."
3,unlistenable,"yo its a dope cd, but every time i hear a sound effect where they edit out the cusswords i want to brake my cd"
2,Other books are better,I found this book to be of little value. I did not gain any additional knowledge beyond what can be found in the javadoc and tutorials. It is also extremely dry and didn't really demonstrate an advanced understanding of swing. I bought this book when I first started with Swing and quickly had to replace it with one of the far better books that are available.
2,Not a good Learners Book,"This book fails to quickly bring new Swing developers up to speed with practical examples early on. Its front-loaded with way too much info (that should come later) before you actually get into practical material half way through the book that presents the actual swing components. It works, its accurate, but it really tried my patience. Get another book."
4,Thomas Moran book is nice:,"In the first part of this large book is a catalogue of images of the artist's paintings. The color reproductions aren't ""perfect"", but they contain enough information to reference the artist's work. If you are looking for a lot of written information on the life of the artist, this is a good book for the price, as the second half is an illustrated (copies of photograph's taken during the artist's life) chronology, which also contains a lot of narrative. Given the price I paid, after seeing the book I would make the purchase again."
3,Not bad but not great either!,"Worth the 6 dollars I paid but I'd say not a cent more. Especially the ""bonus desert footage"" which is a total joke, it only shows alternate views of the desert cliffs and some close ups on sand, big friggin whooptie-doo. So I guess they really mean desert footage quite literally. I loved watching this guy live while the unfortunate war was going on full steam, but this video misses some of his best quotes. The narrator has a kind of annoying voice to me as well, but that's just my opinion. Reminds me of the narrator from the Toology joke-of-a-documentary, maybe tht's why. Anyhoo, do yourself a favor and get one from a flea market or garage sale,etc to save money, cause you probably won't want to watch it more than once. I give it 2 1/2 stars out of 5."
4,How NOT to do PR,"Baghdad Bob... world-class liar! A friend of mine told me that the advance units of the Army were at the Victory Arches when Baghdad Bob went on the air to say ""there are no Americans in Baghdad... none!"" They were tempted to go to the studio where the broadcast was taking place and enter the room where the media were filming this.They decided not to. One argument was that not even this guy could be that stupid... it had to be a trap! The Iraqis must be waiting along the route for the units to go over.very entertaining but could have been better!"
3,Works great!,"This product works great for cleaning my black water holding tank. Without it, I can not get the tank to clean out properly. I would have rated this product higher if it were not for the rather short hose thread connnection that is also made out of plastic. I am expecting that fitting to break or strip threads due to the material used and only being able to thread on a garden hose for approx 2-3 threads."
3,Great Tool,"We bought this spray arm to help with clean out of our holding tanks. We have a problem with the sensor reading, so after reading some of the reviews thought this might help our issue. The first use did not, however, we think we have a plug so we are treating that and hope to be able to use the arm to complete the job and be able to send in a new review."
2,Not great ...,"Pros:1) Lowest price (any where u can find)2)sound quality good for the price (not great)3)radio, voice recorderCons:1)EXTREMELY bad headphones (be prepared to buy new ones)... but the product is a good investment if you already have a spare headphone.2)Bad battery life.... 1 battery is said to work for 18 hrs ... but even duracell doesn't work for more than 4 hrs........................ if u got rechargable batteries then definately worth buying..Overall, if you already have rechargable batteries and a good headphone with you and you don't want to invest heavily in mp3 player then this is definately worth buying....AK"
3,Wiggle,"Purchased this book for my great niece based on a review in the AARP magazine. Book is good but not the ""rave"" book I expected from the review."
3,doris,the story was good. it kept me thinking what was going to happen next. the actors were good and believable. picture quality of this dvd is good as well.
4,"Pretty good, but not great","I was very excited to receive this case. It fits pretty well except there's a little gap at the top because there's no opening for the on/off switch. Also, the case looks a little cheapy. I do like the case, but I think it should have been $10 less."
5,For the true fan from 'Leisure' to '13.',"This book is a must read for a true Blur fan. If you werent already convinced that Blur were one of the most important bands of the 90's this book is sure to do the trick. The author has presented a journey through ten years of both struggle and success that is sure to have any fan breaking out all six records to relive the journey themselves. From the early days of Seymour to the present '13' this book leaves out nothing, and goes much deeper than anything you've read in 'Q' or 'Select.' Get to know Blur beyond the tabloids."
5,The DEFINITIVE Biography of the Best British Band of the 90s,"Well, OK, I would have Blur tied with Suede for the best British rock band of the 1990's (and Oasis nowhere near either of the two). This is the official biography written by Stuart Maconie and released to coincide with Blur's 10 year anniversary in 1999. An excellent book starting with the childhoods of all of the band members and leading up to the triumphant release of Blur's 6th album, 1999's 13. Candid, in depth, and packed with information, this book is great for Blur fans. My one complaint is that, unlike the excellent Suede official biography, this does not contain a timeline, discography, chronology, or anything of the sort. That being said, if you are a Blur fan, this is essential reading."
4,paper towel holder,"Great product, allows me to take one paper towel at a time, sets up vertical or horizontal...sturdy"
1,Not a long lasting item,Bought this paper towel holder and it lasted about 6 months. It now lets the paper roll keep spinning when you try to take only one sheet. Would not buy again.
4,Great Space Saver,"This towel holder has a plastic ratchet which will eventually wear down. Hopefully, this company will correct this problem in the future which will give it the fifth star. Reversing the direction of the new paper towel roll on an alternating basis will prolong this ratchet if this an important part of it for you. We have two holders, one in the kitchen and one in the laundry room Both are wall mounted in a vertical position. This saves us shelf space."
2,Disappointed,"Well, like some others I thought this was going to be the best thing since sliced bread.Sadly it has lasted only a month.That's when it stopped having any resistance and started spinning freely.Found the company #1-800/662-0040 and gave them a call.They are sending a replacement item.Now for the problem details - - -the center rod is screwed into the base section.If you were to grab hold of the center rod tightlyat the pointy end it can be taken apart.Make sure it is tight with the base.Under the larger black plastic sectionthere is a clicker with four tabs.Some how they are what are breaking offand causing the item not to work as designed.Perhaps (?) because the center rod was never tightened enoughand matting the sections properly....just my guess at this point!"
5,Perfect Paper Towel Holder.,"I purchased this product last month, and I am extremely satisfied with its performance as of yet. Installation was simple...well I made my boyfriend do it and he made it look easy. It makes it easy to grab a sheet of paper towel quickly with just one hand. The roll never unravels itself. Yes, it does make noise, but it isn't very loud or bothersome - one would have to be very easily annoyed for its sound to bother you. We have actually deemed it the ""one of the coolest metal objects in our apartment"" - the other cool metal object being our TV antenna that brings us free local HD channels."
5,Great towel holder at a reasonable price,"This towel holder was a great buy. I love the sturdiness of it and the way it dispenses the paper towels, allowing you to control how much you want to pull off. As for the clicking sound, it's really no big deal. Well worth the money."
2,Loud!,"Nice product. Well made. But the while the notchy feel it uses to keep from pulling too many paper towels is effective, it is also very loud. With a newborn in the house, we can't use any paper towels while she's asleep."
2,Where's the resistance?,"I bought two of these based on all the great reviews. The ratchet resistance on this holder just doesn't seem to be there at all. It's extremely easy to just pull more than one paper towel, at least on the holder that I tried. I thought there might be some way to adjust the tension, but didn't see any. So for me, the towels just roll off this thing the same way they would an ordinary paper towel holder. If it were a bit harder to pull, it'd be fine. It just rolls far too easily for me to tear a towel off without the roll spinning. Big disappointment, because I really was pleased to find something like this with so many good reviews. Not in my case, I'm afraid."
1,"Brilliant design, shoddy materials","This worked perfectly, but only for about one month. The internal ratchet mechanism failed, which renders the holder almost useless."
5,Better than anything I could find in local department stores,"I bought one of these last year for the kitchen and I love it. I'm buying another to put near the cat litter box for clean up. Heck, I just might buy two more because I like it so much! I'm sure that I can find another place I could use one, maybe the bathroom.Only downside, as has been mentioned, is the noise made by the ratcheting mechanism. Personally, I don't mind the audio feedback so much."
1,purchased two orders praying manyis,I purchased two units neither unit manifested it self into praying mantis for my granddaughters. have previously purchased the butter fly science project and they all hatched wonderfully.i would not recommend this product
4,Praying Mantis Egg Cases,The egg cases came promptly. They hatched as promised. The claim of over 100 praying mantises per egg case was too high. I estimate more like 25 hatched.
1,Not good in Zone 9 and 10,I live in Zone 10. It's really not good with dry heat. If you live in humid heat. Go for it. Don't get it if you live in Arizona. It won't work without a humidity controlled glass house.
3,"Well, it's good for starters...","Various Artists - Bad Boy's 10th Anniversary: The Hits (Bad Boy, 2004)If you never heard of Bad Boy Records before, then this album IS a good representation of how they topped the charts in the past decade. All of the songs listed here are hits, with the exception of the obligatory new song, ""Victory 2004"" with G Unit. It sounds like they're living off of G Unit's populatrity and the song has no business on here. Also, they did make more hits than this, such as any Faith Evans song (none of them are on here), 112's ""Cupid"", or The Lox's ""Money, Power, & Respect"". Moreover, it would have been cool to include some Bad Boy remixes of other artists' songs like MC Lyte's ""Cold Rock a Party"". The real ""greatest hits"" album would come in the form of a 4-disc box set. So pick this album up if you're a beginner, but if you're a fan (which means you have all of these songs already), create your own Bad Boy compilation. -EJR"
2,Where is Faith?,"This is a decent compilation, but I don't know how you can put together a Bad Boy Anniversary CD with no Faith Evans track. It should have been two discs if P. Diddy didn't think he could fit enough into one."
3,Missing one!,"What about ""One More Chance"" the remix? How could they forget this popular one?!!! This was the jam of the day through out late 95 to early 96."
4,Okay...,"Everyone's giving this album harsh reviews, and while I agree that the album needs some classics, the songs on it weren't that bad. Now here's an unwritten rule: ""don't f*ck with classics because you can't make them better"". Diddy broke that rule when he did ""Victory 2004"". While it's a good listen, the addition of 50 Cent and Lloyd Banks to the song was a bad decision. The last I heard, G-Unit was never on Bad Boy and had nothin to do with its success. The rest of the tracks are good however, despite Diddy's outro. The hidden Mase song is good(""I Ain't No Killer""). The best off Bad Boy, Biggie Smalls, shows up on alot of songs, with no protest. Most of his classics are on here. But where's ""Been Around The World"" and ""Can't Nobody Hold Us Down"". Those songs are classics, yet they're not included. I was glad that Mase' song ""Feel So Good"" was on here. Before there was Kanye West, Mase was the original cocky rapper. Oh by the way, HE'S BACK.Was this review helpful to you?"
2,THESE R THE HITS??????,"I don't know what P. DIDDY was thinking when he made this stupid [...]. Bad Boy definatly made alot more hits than that. Yeah the beats r good, but none of it's deep. It one thing to talk about the ghetto, but bring that presence into the song. B.I.G. was tha only one 2 do that [...] rapper. He ain't deep. If u ask me that whole d*mn label is wak. Mo Money Mo Problems is not a hit. Its a stupid song that P. DIDDY should have took credit for. I don't know if people agree wit me, but I didn't even listen 2 tha album. I looked at the songs and said this is crap. I don't know wat happened 2 tha hits, but they ain't on this album."
4,Great CD but missing classics,"great cd but missing classic bad boy hits such as Victory,I Need a Girl Part I,DIDDY,Bad Boy 4 Life,Peaches & Cream and other 112 hits, Satisfy You and Been Around The World"
5,So much information in a small book!,Bravo! I bought this book to learn more about Chardin and I came away with so much! It is a small book crammed with information and photos. Worth the time and money!
4,Emphasis on deterrence and progressive discipline,"I liked Paul Falcone's emphasis on the objective of a disciplinary system, i.e. ""to create and maintain a productive and responsive workforce..."" I wish I'd read this book before one of my employees brought a gun to work...and almost didn't get fired because I had not documented his previous acts of intimidation. Falcone urges us (and explicitly tells us how to) write up work place problems in such a fashion that adequately documents subpar performance, and encourages the employee to rehabilitate himself or herself.NOTE: I see that other reviewers emphasized the sample letters and diskette, so I'd just like to add that Falcone's introductory chapters are also very informative and lucidly written. He tells you why and how you can treat a subpar employee fairly and thus keep your corporation from having to hire back the employees that you eventually had to fire."
1,why were good songs left off?,"There were 2 great songs left off which is the only reason I bought it. Seal's newborn friend and children of the ghetto by Philip Bailey. Of course all the crumby ones are on there as well as a couple of good ones, but I hate it when greed does this. They shouldn't be allowed to even call it a soundtrack."
5,One of my favs,"I love the whole series that this book comes from. If you like sciFi/fantasy, it is a must read...start with the first book so you know what is going on. I am reading the series for the 10th time...GREAT!!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money on it !,It does not make any difference. Don't waste your money on it hoping that it will remove the dark eye circles.
2,Picture deceptive,"I was very upset when I received only one bar! The picture has two, but that is not what you get. Why would I pay that much for one when I could've bought two for the same price? I do have to say however that the seller was very prompt and courteous at responding to my displeased email. He said it wasn't his fault because Amazon picks the pictures. I'm not sure if that's true because I've never had a problem like that before. Yes it does say only one in the description ( I rechecked it after receiving the item), but unfortunately it's easy to not see it and rely solely on the picture. The quality of the bar is good and I kept it because it would've cost me too much to send back ( plus they charge a restocking fee). Unfortunately I cannot recommend this seller, and will not be purchasing anything again from them."
1,Waste of the little $ I paid for it.,"I resently purchased the velcro version of this. I should have checked the reviews 1st. The flip is weak at best, and the view is completely distorted. I am completely dissapointed."
1,Not worth a dime!,"I managed to install the thing after 20 minutes and throwing away the horrible directions on the back of the box. Then, when I tried to flip it back ""out of sight,"" it only went about 1/2 way and still blocked my view. Also, the mirror seems to be a sticker so the view is distorted. I'll be returning this item and looking for something else!"
1,Low budget Christian propaganda,"Don't waste your money. It's like watching an amateur class project made by a sunday school class. Also sold under the name ""The Adventures of Chris Fable"" with Harry Potter type font to trick kids (and adults like me) into renting it.Message = ""There's a war coming! Better read your bible or you'll burn for eternity!!"""
5,Save Thousands On Therapy,"If you do even half of the exercises in this book with your wife (or husband or girlfriend or sig. other) you will feel a huge change. Just learning to untie the relationship knots by ""shifting out of the family trance"" is enough to open your relationship up and move past those big dumb blockages we get stuck in. My wife is halfway through this book, and we've done the exercises for five nights, and we really turned a corner. Hopefully it'll stick. (We skipped some of the stuff that's too deep.) Last time we were in therapy we just yelled at each other. This feels much more healthy, not to mention the money we're saving!"
2,Waterproof? Nope,"Within a few weeks, the exterior started to rub off leaving the plastic exposed -looked junky. Went skindiving (never changed batteries, so I did not break the seal) and came out of the water with it drowned. Threw away after about 9 months."
3,Can we say tangles!!!!,"My daughter loves this toy, but is always coming to me to untangle the doll's hair. Quite a bit of hair falls out each time I comb/brush it. I also find wads of hair in my daughter's room when she combs/brushes it. I wish that the material used for the hair would be more manageable."
2,unexpectedly displeased/not satisfied,"I bought this for a 2 year old who loves to dance, also buying a lei and hula outfit. I was very disappointed that this video was broken down into the selections, and there wasn't a 'play all' but a person has to use the remote to select something continually thru the video. It's to learn hula, but each section is so short, so slow and boring, and it's just not a video that teaches as well as entertains. A tooth can be pulled slowly or quickly, but either way the tooth can be pulled. Why make an educational video more boring and slow than it has to be? I'll now be shopping around here for a better one. Need to go, now, and look to see what I paid on this."
5,Danceable AND hummable,"It's upbeat, it's real music, it's a delight. Every track! He's already been compared to Prince and Todd Rundgren. I think XTC might be in the mix there, too. Find out for yourself!"
5,"it grows on you, when it does, you wont regret buying it","I'm the kind of person who buys a CD if i like just one song, and at first when i was listening to all the songs i was quite skeptical on whether i would like it or not.. But i would say that maybe the 2nd or 3rd time i listened to it, i really enjoyed the whole cd.. I'm always humming to it during class, and whenever.. It's a great CD.. one of my favorites most definitely.."
5,The Freshest New Sound Since Smashing Pumpkins,"The New Radicals manage to stir up quite a musical cocktail by amalgamating so many different music influences-Rolling Stones, Lou Reed/Velvet Underground, Pet Shop Boys, and even a dash of Beatles-and arriving at their own unique sound. A ""must-have"" for any true Rock enthusiast."
5,BRILLIANT! WHAT AN ALBUM,"For there first album this is brilliant. Every song is good especially ""You get what you give"". If you like ""You get what you give"" your going to like this album. Brilliant."
3,"Good album, but cut back on the social commentary","On the whole, a good album...in my opinion, the best song by far is ""Mother we just can't get enough."" ""Someday we'll know"" is beautiful and melancholy. Unfortunately, Gregg Alexander's social commentary is forced and gets old fast. I felt cheated by the title track, ""Maybe you'll..."" For fun, read the lyrics sheet and find all the printed lyrics that Alexander never actually sings."
1,piece of crap from wannabe-rockers,"Please...what that stupid MTV video from those guys? That's the so called ""mall-generation"", trying to look mean and have an attitude. Bunch of worthless chearleaders. How can you even start considering this junk rock and roll? It's like that SugarRay dude, that sucks as much as the New Radicals. They are even worse, because they claim to be ""alternative"". Yeah, right. If you want real indie recordings, real rock, real emotions, REAL MUSIC (not that puked-out-big-release-to-make-money), go to early R.E.M., Pavement, Neutral Milk Hotel, Guided By Voices, Folk Implosion, Yo La Tengo, Built to Spill, Belle and Sebastian, Tori Amos. Your soul will thank you. SCREW THAT LEAD SINGER AND HIS FAKE STREETSMART ATTITUDE!!!"
2,don't be brainwashed into buying this one!,"I love ""You Get What You Give"", don't get me wrong, but the rest of the CD is not up to par. I really expected better from these guys because I absolutely LOVE ""You Get What You Give"", it makes me want to get up and dance and I'd anticipated much more of an upbeat CD. I was dissapointed in the rest of the CD. Now ,though, after reading all these reviews that rave about the rest I'll give it another listen through. (So, this review is subject to change)."
2,The alpha and omega of dreadful albums with one GREAT song,"I bought this on the strength of the sublime ""you Get What You Give,"" which I consider one of the greatest pop songs ever, bar none. Beat early 70s Todd Rundgren at his own game, which is saying a lot coming from me. But there was nothing else on the album that had anywhere near the same effect on me.Perhaps the other songs suffered by comparison, like a time my family went fishing and the decent 8 inch perch we were catching instantly shrunk when my dad caught a 15 inch monster.Still, YGWYG is such an awesome work that it gives the album its 2nd star, and I debated a third. In fact, if you can't find the single, that one song is worth the price of the album."
4,Familiar but different.,"Amazon.com's review of this album was right on the mark when it states that World Party has a large influence on the music. For many days I, myself thought that World Party had changed their name. Unfortunatly this groug has a ways to go to create the unique and creative sound that World Party has attained. Yet people should check this album out. It presents an alternative sound that some might find appealling. And, it is not often that an album like this can express a pop and alternative sound at the same time. A good start for the New Radicals. Hopefully a good future."
2,Sounds like a blast from the past,"Did anyone else think ""You Get What You Give"" was Jeff Lynn or ELO when they first heard it? This tune is the best on the CD. The rest are all just whiny assed tracks & before long the lead dude's voice just gets on one's nerves. Save your money and just get a friend to dub You Get What You Give for you!"
1,Bubblegum Anyone?,"And not even good bubblegum, while we're at it. Overwrought singing, insipid lyrics, uninspired musical compositions. I should have known what to expect when I saw the cover photos of a kid with a fresh empty face. For the young teen (and terminally unmusical) crowd only."
2,Texsport Cranfield Screen Arbor,This item failed miserably with inclement weather. It puddles on top and creates enough weight from the rain to shatter the PVC connectors and also bends/breaks the flimsy poles. If you buy make sure you take it down with the first sign of wind or rain. It didn't last a month and parts are out of stock so you can't even get replacements. THey told me it would be 3 more weeks before they have any. So much for using it during the camping trips this summer.
3,easily breakable,"I am happy that I ordered 2 of these, because this item is very fragile. Be careful, because it will easily break."
1,"Text Is Slow, Sparse, Introductory; Save Your Money","If you do not know database, or you need a very slow introduction to both databases and how to use them in Delphi, this may be the book for you. The book touts itself as Advanced on its back cover level rating. I don't know what marketing manager came up with Advanced, but this book is not even Intermediate -- it is Introductory. Do you know relational databse design? Well, the table of contents divides this book into three parts, and Part One is relational database design. If you already know the basics, this is just a rehash of everything you already know. None of the examples in parts two and three could be called Advanced -- they are Introductory. This is a book for beginners. The only thing that might be a redeeming quality of this book is that the Appendix has an exhaustive list of BDE API calls, but if you don't need this text (sans examples, etc.), this book won't do you any good. I was very disappointed. CONCLUSION: LOOK ELSEWHERE."
3,becoming warm,"the size is compact n i fall in love with it the moment i saw it. but the problem with this camera is , it becomes warm easily.the battery life too is quite short though many claimed to have good battery life. it just last for about 2 hrs or so.dont know if you would consider that long lasting.the size is too small that u mite lose it if you dont be careful about it."
5,Alexandrs Stoddard's >Book of Color,Another excellent and enlightening book by a wonderful author ~ she brings joy and happiness to so many lives!
3,"I love Gravitation, but $10 per half hour?","I love Gravitation, but $30 for only 3 episodes? Sounds like a rip off to me. I'll stick with my fan-subs, thank you. It's probably better than the lousy dubbing anyway."
3,Eh,"I read all the Gravitation I can get my hands on and I have to say, if your a Gravi fan this DVD is a dissapointment. The Anime has way to much cut out. And I'm not just talking about the male on male action. The basics are coverd and thats about it. It's cut and dry. What you need to know to follow the story line basicly. The voice acting supprised me too. That and the singing is about all the good this anime is. It's like everyone says, ""The books are allways better than the movies."""
4,Compact yet useful,"The book is very short but written in a friendly and concise language. It provides a lot of vital information on the subtle details that many Pagan store owners overlook but contribute to the demise of many stores. Most Pagans stores in my area have been closing lately and after reading this book I found out why.The book doesn't talk about everything you need to know to open a Pagan store but it does something more important, it tells you the little details that you need to pay attention to to create have a successful store that won't close after the first year. I haven't found a comparable source elsewhere."
3,Dieux Show Us More,"The guys are hot, but it's just a tease. I won't buy another unless there is more full frontal."
4,A good starting point for business and finance students,"This book is updated to the latest development in financial market, institutions and structure.It concisely presented the money and capital markets with a touch of history and functionality.I particularly like the balanced view of the authors in their presentations. It successfully illustrates the functional as well as risk consideration of the markets and institutions.This book should serve well for student studying in domestic financial market and also as a bridging link to international financial system."
3,Decent read if you have to sit on a plane for 5 hours!,"An interesting storyline concept. I liked the level of character development the author chose to pursue. At times the story was a bit tangential, and I skipped a few pages....but you read to the end because you really want to know where Alice, Andrew, Odette and Leo end up! Great reading for the plane!"
2,Meh,"Long, pointless and godawful confusing. I got to the end, and still feel like I missed something. Hopefully the next book is better."
1,could barely get thru it,"Love this series, forced myself to get thru this one but it was painful. I was somewhat confused by the storytelling, disinterested because in essence it didn't have the characters I had come to love in the series, and annoyed with the culture of the the planet in which the story is set (I can take a little of a woman is dirt culture, but not a lot --- certainly not an entire book.) Read it only to keep up with the storyline since it greatly affects the books hereafter with the change to Cherijo's personality (which at least is more readable altho I still dislike the new Cherijo.)"
4,Weighty but Worthwhile,"I read this book while preparing a paper on Ossian. Ms. Stafford is, in my opinion, the leading authority on Macpherson. She has a keen understanding of the perspectives that contributed to the creation and the stigmatising of Macpherson and his epic poem Ossian. He is a figure worthy of study and the author paints a very detailed picture of Macpherson and the 18th century Edinburgh literati. It is truly a tragedy that the merits of this work (and of Macpherson himself) have been relegated to a secondary status as a footnote to 18th century literature, while lesser works have become part of the sacred ""canon"". With this book Fiona Stafford begins a reassessment of Ossian and Macpherson, that seeks to restore this wonderful work to the literary prominence it so strongly deserves. This is a very readable study, though it could prove a bit dry for the casual reader."
3,Invaluable reference,"I bought this book on a recommendation in a John McPhee work. It's out of date, of course, but still an interesting look at what we use the most common minerals for, where they're found, and how difficult they are to extract. What's perhaps most interesting is where the author guesses right and wrong about how people will react to shortages in various minerals in the decades following publication (late 60s). He made some shrewd guesses, but missed the coming importance of ceramics, plastics, and graphite. It's the old story of whale oil: what will we use when we can no longer burn it in our lamps?"
3,Good but repetitive,"The album starts out great and kept me interested most of the time. Unfortunately, it gets a little to repetitive in the middle of the album and becomes a bit tedious to listen to the whole way through. Either way, a good disc, but I wish it had a little more surprise and a little less textbook structure."
1,Surprised.,"Of course I should have known that I would not get a full size serving spoon for $6.This is a lesson learned.Since the ""serving"" spoon (that is the size of a soup spoon) does not match the rest of my soup spoons, I just put it in a drawer to look at before I order something on line. It is a reminder that satisfaction is directly correlated with an informed buyer."
2,Main Character seems psycho to me!,"This is the first book I had ever read by Terri Blackstock. It was not a good first impression. I had not read the other reviews on Amazon, but I have to agree w/ the 1 and 2 stars. I thought the main character seemed like a psycho!!! She gave me the creeps! I hated how she inserted herself so forcefully into Wes and Amy's life. She was so pushy and inconsiderate! What a nightmare to someone who has adopted a child! I don't see how in the world Wes could have fallen for her. I would have ran away from her if I had been him! This book might have been ok if the characters and the whole storyline had been developed w/ a little more thought as to how Laney and Wes would come across in print. I didn't really like it very much, and I don't recommend it."
2,A Selfish Female Character,"Being adopted myself, the main female character in this book made me shutter. Is the author sure about Laney Fields being the protagonist? She acts more like the villain with her selfishness and her lack of concern for her daughter's well-being. While well-written, I couldn't get past the characterization and have to give it a poor rating for that reason alone."
