3,Great History lesson...,Great Martial arts lesson for the time but where were the Midwest Martial Arts Legends...No mention of them at all..They missed a real great opportunity there...
4,Martial Arts masters,"This doesn't feature any footage of Bruce Lee apart from a few stills and some mention of his influence. However in all other respects the rest of the film is first class.Leading experts from various martial arts areas (Kendo, various forms of Karate, Jujitsu, Kung Fu, Tai Chi as well as weapons experts etc) are all shown demonstrating their skills with devastating effectiveness and discussing them with equal facility.Amongst the better known martial artists are:Chuck NorrisDan InosantoMaster Poi ChenMike StoneMaster Moses PowellUnlike one of the previous critical reviewers I actually found the Jujitsu master the most impressive of all the guys on display. The truth is they are, or at least were, amongst the very best at the time the film was made. Criticising from behind the keyboard 30 years after these guys were at their peak, is I think a little unfair!Highly recommended to anyone interested in martial arts."
2,This gus in love,"I absolutely love steve tyrell. His voice is incredible. I love the songs from that time period. However, his latest was a disappointment. it is not up to his usual standards."
2,This Guy's in Love,"Well...""it's a difference of opinion that makes horse racing."" Contray to the glowing reviews that Steve Tyrell's long awaited fourth CD has received, I feel that it's no match to his previous three CD releases. To this trained ear, it sounded like he was imitating himself."
5,Love this CD!,"I first saw Steve Tyrell on the ""Today"" show doing an interview w/Katie Couric re: the death of his wife from colon cancer. While I was quite touched by his loss I was blown away by the snippets of music they aired of this CD.I received it yesterday and I cannot tell you how many times I have played it ... over and over and over again. I rarely read who producers or arranges music on cd's, but I had to know, I love this cd that much. Kudos to all involved. This is one sexy cd. It reached that romantic part of me that we have all experienced in that first rush of new love, no matter what age you happen to be. It makes me feel happy, glowing, girlish.I've purcahsed Rod Stewart's ""All American Songbook""and Michael Buble's first cd and while they were both OK, I hardly listen to them. I've already put in my Amazon cart another of Steve TYrell's CD's. What a rush! BUY IT."
5,This is such an awesome album,"All of Steve's album are the best. The arrangements, the musicians are beyond compare. Anyone that does not buy this album are missing out on the best music from the best composers this country has ever known. Steve has this wonderful, unique voice with a hint of a Texas accent that makes it irresistable. Check out the website of Plas Johnson. What an amazing talent and career. What can I say about Clark Terry? There's a tract (10) with Lew Soloff (Blood, Sweat and Tears. Then there is Burt Bacharach, a talent that speaks for itself."
4,Electric from start to finish,"After a blood feud kills most of her family, Princess Tatiana Jacanek of Cardinia is sent to America to be raised in exile so that her family's enemies will never find her. Years later, King Stefan of Cardinia travels to Mississippi to find his erstwhile bride.The spark between Stefan and Tatiana is electric from start to finish. In the beginning, I just kept hoping that one of them would lay their cards on the table and stop playing games, but their catty interplay was part of what I liked most about this book. The chemistry between these two makes this book shine as one of my favorite Lindsey novels. I would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for a solid romance."
1,BARELY BEARABLE,"I just didn't like this book. I hated how she was referred to a whore the whole way through. She just didn't seem like a princess and her life just didn't seem believable in the least. I know this is fiction, but come on. So far I have only enjoyed two J.L. books, (the magic of you) and (love only once) I hope to find more that I like, but this wasn't one."
5,Truly excellent book,This is my all time favorite Johanna Lindsey novel. The heroine is extremely bright and capable and undauntable. I loved that she didn't buy into what truly was an unbelievable story told to her by three obnoxious gentlemen. And I loved that they kept underestimating her time and time again. Tatiana was no victim here! And her chemistry with Stephen was riveting.
3,shallow leading ladies,"Lindsey can create some story lines that have potential. She falls short in creating likable leading ladies. With the exception of Reina, the ladies are always blah, Pretty but stupid. Try reading C L Wilson or Catherine Anderson for true ladies of depth and worthiness. Now Stephan had potential. Passion, strong, loyal, and flawed. But with Tanya your just thinking someone please kill her. I could not stand her. Dumb ending as well."
4,Great video!,I purchased this video to help my 3 year old autistic son learn his written numerals. It honestly has not helped him as much as the talking letters factory. My 2 year old autistic daughter however really benefited from it! I do think that throwing the counting by 2's in there is mildly confusing at this stage. My daughter went through a few weeks of counting things by 2's but not actually grouping them in 2's. She should have been rote counting but was getting confused. Great video overall and will continue to show it to my children.
3,Excellent plastic / Poor Sealing,"I have used aloksaks for the last eight years, including deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. I am currently in Jamaica and use in the mountains. The plastic is the best. I have yet had one fail due to punctures. I keep my Ipod touch inside and can manipulate the controls perfectly. They are also great for a passport holder, perfect size, nice and compact. The sealing zipper is inconsistent. I have read the instructions and followed them to seal and they still do not stay shut, especially when packed with other items that will pop open the seal. If I want something to stay waterproof I prefer freezer grade ziplock bags, double bagged, depending on the value of the item I am protecting. The one advantage of the alosaks is the variety of sizes, but having a perfectly sized bag versus a wet item is a no-brainer. The shipping from this vendor is excellent."
4,Good for Motorola RAZR droid phone,"Works great for keeping my cell phone dry and free of dirt and dust and sand. At the beach, gardening, painting, caulking, even in the kitchen. You can hear, talk, and swipe the phone through it with no problem. It's a little large for the phone, but the smaller size would be too small, I think. The sleeve does get scratched up and turns cloudy, but that's cosmetic. For the price, I plan to just replace it every 2 months or so."
4,great for keeping your passport dry,Several years ago I was caught in monsoon rains. I was wet to my skin (my shoes shrank!) The passport in my pocket was soaked thru as well. While usable the passport quickly became so tattered I started having trouble crossing boarders.Since thenI always carry my new passport in an aLokSak bag.A bag will last a few month before the zipper becomes detached from the bag's body. If you only travel occasionally three bags will last you a long time.
1,NOT 6X9!!!!!!!,These bags say 6x9 but that is far below the interior space afforded. Don't buy them and don't try to return them. A busy person only gets 30 days and then they are screwed.
2,Not really 9 X 6,"Hoping to be comfortable taking my Amazon Kindle poolside, I got these bags (9 X 6) before vacation. Since the Kindle measures only 5 3/8 inches by 8 1/4, it should fit.Wrong. These bags measure only 5 1/4 by 8 3/4 inside the zipper.They do a great job keeping out the water, just don't plan on putting something that is 6X9 into them."
5,great thick bags,these bags are great!! i have bought several different sizes for my hiking stuff. i used them to store all my first aid supplies in. thick heavy duty construction makes me think they wont rip with continued use.
2,Just Expensive Zplock Plastic Bags,"Would I buy them again? Not likely. It's not that the product itself is any less than what it promises to be but that's just it - if you need a plastic baggie this is the expensive way to go. For a fraction of the cost just get a box of plastic zip top bags at the grocery or big box retailer. They say their zip enclosure is patented? Doesn't seem any different to me than the baggies that cost far far less. One thing on the plus side this bag does fit the iPhone 3G, 4, 4S (but not 5) quite well for keeping it splash resistant. It's a bit too snug to fit the iPhone 5 inside and still be able to close the bag up. Using the touch screen while the phone is in the bag is easy and responsive."
2,I was very disappointed. No illustrations.,"I was under the impression that this would include the original illustrations. . but unless there's a magic way to see them, there are none. There are 16 pages of blanks but not one illustration.I fell ripped off."
4,Some nice new things and some retreads,"Dean was producing hits so quickly from 1965-68 that with all his television and movie appearances he hardly had time to record enough material to fill new albums. So, Reprise re-released some laid back country material from 1962-63 for these albums, along with new hit versions of ""Somewhere There's A Someone"", ""A Million And One"", and ""Come Running Back"". Three other cuts are worth mentioning -- ""That Old Clock On The Wall"" has a great rhythm and strong beat, and was written by Dean's pianist Ken Lane (who also wrote ""Everybody Loves Somebody""). ""Shades"" is a truly fine country song with a really neat arrangement, and probably was intended as the hit side of ""A Million And One"". And ""Nobody But A Fool"" is just one heck of a fun country novelty number."
5,"Politically Correct, But Passionate","Ellen Zwilich's 4th Symphony (The Gardens) was written to commemorate and immortalize rare and endangered, as well as common, species of plants in the Michigan State University gardens. This piece has moments of wonder and hope for the future (""We will protect our heritage!"" sings the children's chorus), as well as questions of what might have been (""Meditation on Living Fossils"" has segments that make me think of wiry limbs trying desperately to cling to life, and not quite succeeding).David Jolley and Charles Vernon are masters of their instruments, and soar through these concerti, commissioned for them specifically. While both concerti can be dark and desolate at times, they are stunningly performed and recorded. And the Michigan State University Orchestra and Leon Gregorian perform with passion throughout. Kudos to all involved."
1,Hmmmm....,"The soloist, Jolley and Vernon, are great to listen to. The music is very typical Zwilich. i.e. Her horn concerto sounds like her bassoon concerto, which sounds like her symphony, which sounds like her oboe concerto...etc. But there is still is something flavorful in her music.I'm sure Gregorian worked with Zwilich for the recording but I still find his interpretation a bit elementary. The Michigan State Symphony shows much promise but this recording overall, is a bit stagnant!"
1,Stereotype of children who are deaf or hard of hearing.,"As someone with a severe hearing loss, and also the father of a 7 year old girl with a profound hearing loss--I thought the focus of the book was too much on what the sister, who is deaf, could not do. Too stereotypical--I would NOT recommend this book for purchase."
3,'sok,This book has much less information than anticipated. It's still helpful and as a kindle download can be referenced on my phone.
3,prayer,pray is important now more than ever it is the only way you will by pass the evil in this present day we need pray more than ever
5,I love this single,I love this single and am very happy with this purchase out of all of Sean Paul's song I really love this one the best!
2,Won't stay in the air,"This airplane just won't stay in the air, the motor become powerless quickly after few slow circles in the air.(so it dives down quickly) Another problem is the airplane is not responsive enough to the remote control, it feels like you have to hold the remote control stick for a long time then it starts to turn in the air. I would say this kind of quality is only worth about $20 but I paid almost $50 for it. :)"
1,LMAO.... ALL I HAVE TO SAY....,"OMG.. I would never in a million years recommend this CD to my worse enemy. This little gurl has no business being in the record industry because Frankly she can't sing. She's actually worse then Lumidee. I think she should stay in school and get an education so she can go to college, cause her voice won't get her anywhere. Have no fear, her album will sell..To Family and Friends That is.. That is all....."
3,Another nice little Full Moon flik,"A pretty keen Full Mooner. Again, not terribly strong on the script or acting fronts, but high on creativity. I like how all the demons are just servants of God doing their jobs, and not something evil. And how angels don't nessicarily have to come from Heaven. If you can't watch it for any other reason, watch it for Angela Featherstone alone. She's so darn cute."
3,An Ok to actually good movie to watch.,"i bought this movie Brand New From Amazon about a year ago for 19.99 and i have to say it was money well spent. it had some weird sequences for example,there were demons in hell that worshiped God. Ive Got To tell the truth that made some parts of the movie not worth watching,but overall it was a good movie. i love the little non release to theater full moon movies.they are actually pretty entertaining to be low budget.i watch this movie ever now and then but its not a regualar for me.its a pretty rare,expinsive movie to be a vhs. now dont get me wrong i would pick VHS's over DVD's any day of the week. well before you do anything rash,go rent this movie first before you buy it.you might like it you might not. its just one of those kinds of movies."
5,No problems,I've used TDK cd-r for years and I've never had any problems. I recommend this brand for being reliable and affordable.
4,Interesting story,"This is an intersting biography of a Scottish man who loved God. It's a very simple setting and not too exciting, but we like those kind of shows."
5,Inspiring,"I saw the movie when it first came out, and fell in love with it. It was heartwarming, inspiration and just made me cry. He was a man of God with a true inspiration for his calling. A few years ago I began writing Catherine, his wife. We never met but I feel we became friends. You cannot see this moving without coming away awe-inspired. Even though it is not a new release, it is a must see movie."
4,A Man Called Peter CD,I have always followed author Catherine Marshall's writings so when I first saw this movie on TV I was thrilled to be able to see the movie version of the book. I was equally thrilled to be able to own the CD and be able to watch it any time I want. My husband also really enjoyed it and he's never followed Catherine Marshall's writings and was not familiar with Peter Marshall. We both thought the movie was very well done and the acting was very good in it.
4,EXCELLENT,i FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE IN 1955 - UNABLE TO BUY IT IN AUSTRALIA I HEARD I COULD BUY IT FROM AMAZON - IT IS A WONDERFUL THOUGHT-PROVOKING MOVIE THAT I BELIEVE HAS STOOD THE TEST OF TIME.
5,Invitation to Chinese Cooking,Wonderful book lots of great receipts to try. Loved Yan on TV and his books are just as much fun as he is.
2,Not the best cookbook,"I try not to have cookbooks clutter my shelves, but I have heard so much about this from flylady.net that I thought to buy it. I don't like the recipes very much."
4,Great cook book with new recipes!,"I like this cook book because it gives you shopping lists for all of the recipes. It also has a lot of things that i used to make..where you just switch out one or two ingredients and they become a lot healthier (like goulash)!The only thing i dont like is that there is a lot of repeat recipes. I get that this is a planner, but i really dont need them to plan out my whole year...so i feel recipes shouldnt get repeated."
5,Menu planning makes the difference,"Great book. I have subscribed to Leanne's menu mailer, but I find the book format easier to use. My picky family likes the recipes, and not having to think about what it fix is wonderful. I post the weekly menu and everyone can check it themselves. No more frantically trying to figure out what to fix at 5:00pm."
1,Worst lock I ever owned,"I have owned lots of bike locks in many many years of cycling and this one is the first one I have ever owned that actually failed in my hands. I bought it less than one year ago and when I was trying to lock it the last time, the end that sticks into the combination part broke off. That's right, the metal cable that I relied on to keep my bike save simply broke in two. I would never buy another lock from Onguard ever."
2,A Major Disappointment,"From a jazz icon, a high-classed disco album. Well arranged, well played, well recorded, but well--who needs it? A major disappointment from a major talent."
1,Not compatible,It was offered in a package and is not compatible . This item was offered with the scanner and garmin as a package other people ordered.
1,Silly!!!!,"Let's be honest about what this is. It is a mood-reader credit card (hold your thumb on it and based on your body temperture, the card will turn blue or green or red) which supposedly tells you how relaxed or nervous you are. The more nervous you are, the less you are in control of your habit. Well...duh!!! Not really worth the trouble. The pamphlet, which is as long as the editorial review posted here, also gives a couple of mind control and relaxation tips."
4,QUITE GOOD FOR THE FOURTH ENTRY INTO THE SERIES,"I don't know how many other movie franchises can make this claim. Having three worthy sequels is a major feat! This installment may be the best since the first film, with a good mix of chills and laughs! The monsters are much more convincing than the last film with no CGI and there are plenty of jabs at the series. If you are a fan of these films, this is another good entry."
4,piano and voice,"the first number is giving you a real trance, it makes you rest and you want to play it over and over...I like to work on it.. casting no shadow...a GREAT cd. I know his music for a LONG time. This is one of the best. If you like this piano, buy jerimiades...."
5,A fabulous read!,"All I can say is ""Wow"". Jim Bell's new novel DEADLOCK is a book that grabs hold in the first paragraph and doesn't let go. With a riveting plot line that takes off on the premise of a Supreme Court judge converting to Christianity, it read like something right out of the front pages. I love it when I learn something from a book too, and it was fascinating to see how the Supreme Court works and all the politics involved in decisions. I can't recommend this book highly enough!"
5,"Great album, lot's of fun","This album is great, it has a lot of cool funk to it. It is perfect for getting you psyched up (i.e. you have two hours before your term paper is due, and you haven't slept in three days)"
2,The way of Zen,"I was really interested in hearing more from Alan Watts and his view on life. But once i got the CD's I found out that Alan Watts was only in for brief segments, and that the CD was actually narrated by another gentlemen. I've been searching for a long time for pieces of Alan Watts segments that he has in his life and I thought that ""the way of zen"" was an audio collection of his work, however, it only offers very small recordings here and there. I really do wish that there are CD's with his teachings and views on life where i can hear him speak, not someone narrating his voice and words."
2,The book is excellent - the audio tape is not,"Please don't be fooled by the enthusiastic reviews based on the book that... I understand that the publisher has a lot of information to present in condensing a book to an audio form, however the narration is so rapid fire and fast paced it is almost impossible to simply sit and enjoy the recording. Although academically excellent, the author's insights are lost as the narrator jumps from topic to topic, speaking as quickly as he can and bombarding the listener with concept after concept. (This seems so odd and out of place for a work on Zen). It is like trying to drink from a cup while someone is tipping the other end. It would seem fair that to get the most out of this tape, you would have to listen to it again and again, but I found this experience to be unbearable. Buy the book. Avoid the audio tape."
5,ZEN AT ITS BEST!,ANYONE NEW TO ZEN A STUDY OF THE HISTORY AND DIRECTION OF IT.ALSO WRITTEN BY ALAN WATTS ENOUGH SAID !!!!
5,totally uncensored,"This is my favorite guily pleasure and it delivers in all its uncensored glory. This is a great study in sexual human behavior in infidelity and what people will say when they're busted. ""It's just a friend"" is the number one excuse after getting busted and just before the cheater is shown video proof of his/her misdeeds. I love the look on their faces. It's always the same deer caught in headlights look. For any ""Cheaters"" fan who wants to see what really happens(most of it as raw as they can get away with) and what's really bleeped out(some of it is clever profanities but most is everyone cussing at each other - which is still very funny) should run and purchase this volume and volume 2 which will be my next purchase."
5,Best of Cheaters DVD,"Once I see ""Cheaters"" I can't stop watching it. You never know what will happen at the end, which just builds up even more anticipation in you when you're watching the show. I'm sure the DVD has some amazing footage of the people because I haven't seen all the episodes on TV, but I've seen some pretty good ones. And this show is pure reality television-a host being stabbed on television by a crazy contestant, I mean it doesn't get more real than that!"
5,great blanket,It is totally waterproof and easy to fold up and it also fits great on the handles of my Bob stroller....It was a worthwhile purchase..
4,Carpet Saver!,"Our son is the spit up king. Never has bothered him much, but our carpet would tell you different.We bought this to protect our carpet from tidal waves of sour milk, as well as to protect our babe's sensitive skin from the carpet (while we could.) If you get to the spit up relatively quickly, you can wipe it up without having any soak in. It's definitely not waterproof, but much better than the carpet or a blanket (which we were washing almost every day). It folds up very easy into a what looks like a little bag (it's not a bag); it's a super idea.We (meaning he) stopped using this when he started scooting all over the house. I also was skeptical that it may have been inhibiting his learning to crawl because it is so slippery! It's sitting in the car trunk now, but I think it will work really well to keep in the car as an outdoor blanket to watch fireworks, etc."
5,Stop looking...This is it!,"Absolutely the best. We have been using this for over 3 years now, so this is not an impulsive review. We used it in the woods, beach, in wind, sun etc. It is designed very well to accommodate all sorts of terrain and weather conditions. And after 3 years and a lot of mileage, still looks like new! All in all, great product!"
2,WAAAAY too heavy,"I would prefer something I can put inside my diaper bag, it is a heavy blanket that takes up too much space in my opinion. Nice looking though.."
5,We use as a stadium seat cushion,"I had hoped this would be a little more blanket-like, a weatherproof stadium blanket. However, it is too rigid to wrap up in. It actually though is great as a seat cushion. We just open the velcro flap and roll it out along the bench. We don't unfold the entire blanket, just leave it bench width. It has several layers of thickness and keeps our bottoms warm, so payed for itself when I didn't have to buy 4 bench warmer cushions, and is much more convenient to carry! And it's a piece of cake to fold back up perfectly every time.It is a really nice quality item, and I'm sure that in summer we'll use it at the beach or on the lawn."
3,"snaps broke, probably returning","The blanket itself is nice - very portable, and we enjoyed a nice day on the beach sitting on it. However, the snap (that holds the handle on) broke on the first use. I contacted amazon and they sent me a replacement immediately (very good customer service!). The replacement blanket had the same problem though - snap broke on the first use! I'm debating returning the 2nd one for a refund vs. securing the strap some other way because I do like the blanket."
3,Nice but ...,Lovely picnic blanket but I was a little disappointed as I thought the striped part is cotton like my previous one but turned out to be polyester.. But I'm sure it'll still work out great.
5,Ultimate multi purpose blanket,"This is the perfect blanket to keep in your trunk, unfolds and refolds easily. Fits nicely in the bottom of a stroller. It would even fit perfectly under a car seat."
5,Marley and Me' the real Bob Marley Story,I ordered this book for my husband. He thoroughly enjoyed the book and didn't feel it was slanderous as some reported here. He thought it was just a good book with the facts about what his life was like.
1,Don't Support This Crook,"Don Taylor was Bob Marley's manager, yes. But he also stole alot of money from Bob - he lied about concert earnings to put more money in his own pocket. Anyone who buys this book is directly supporting a man who stole from Marley. Bob was pissed when he found out about Taylor's dishonesty, and he wrote Bad Card, a song off of his masterpiece, Uprising (1980). I refuse to pay for a book that will benefit a man who stole from Bob Marley. Don Taylor, you are a filthy thief, and your attempt to capitalize off of Bob makes me SICK."
2,disappointed,"I have been buying workout video's/DVD's with Denise Austin for years and have been very happy with them. However since Denise is no longer with Artisan (she is now with Lions Gate) the quality has changed. The camera man can't seem to sit still. When I buy a workout DVD, it's not because I want to look at a pertty face. Far to often the camera man is giving an up close of a face when he should be showing the whole body so we can see what we, or as in this case our child/ren, need to do. By the second workout, the camera man slowed it down making it much easier to follow. Still, it is not the quality I am used to from Denise. It could have been a great workout but instead it was a big disappointment!"
4,"What I needed, at a good price","The video was exactly what I needed and at a good price. It wasn't new, but it works and helps me keep my kindergarten students fit on a rainy or cold day."
2,On Brindle,"This book is thorough, however it assumes too much familiarity with the classical repertoire like so many other books on music composition. To utilize this book you would have had to a)perform what seems like nearly all of the classical repertoire when you were in high school and recognize the music by name, b)starting on your masters degree in music or c) be capable of performing all of the examples on sight and want to. This book is not very accessible and is only for experienced classical composers with an emphasis on the 20th centery. Too hoity toity for me. I can't recommend this book to anyone except seasoned classical afficianado's."
5,Great Fun!,"This book, like the other books in the Henry Reed series, is very enjoyable. Kids of all ages will enjoy Henry's adventures in babysitting. These books are timeless in their ability to provoke laughter and create a sense of fun for the reader."
2,Why is this the standard guide?,"Given there really are no other guides to tube radios out there. Is that any reason to praise it?1. Far two few photos.2. Inconsistant descriptions.3. Some common radios not listed.4. Prices are beyond ridiculously low. (They may be correct if your buying a radio from your Grandmother in Idaho. )5. No history or information on the manufacterers.Unfortunately this is really all there is, and if you collect tube radios you have to have something."
2,Boring!!,"I bought this game because of its great reviews. However, I'm surprised at the lack of fighting and basic physics of the movement. The world his huge...yeah, great, but the simple movement is so monotonous and slow. Why can't we get the movement from Zelda? I just don't see what the hype is all about."
3,Help??,"Please comment on this review to help me, on my 360 all other games work great but Oblivion. I've had it for 2 two days now.The first day it worked fine. Now it freezes when I pause, go to my inventory, go in and out of doors, when it loads areas, or sometimes randomly and it all takes anywhere from 5 seconds to 5 minutes. And it happens every 10-15 seconds, sometimes less. Also load times have been extra long. Please comment to help me out!!"
1,Best game ever but buy Goty,"This is the same price as the game of the year edition, which has an extra 20-60 hours of game play, less gliches, and the disc dosn;t fry if you play for to long!"
5,Oblivion the elder scrolls lV,Oblivion is the best video game I have ever bought for my son age 12-Unless you cheat and use a guide book there are hours and hours of interesting play. My son has played the game for two months and still has more stuff to find--usually he finishes a video game in a couple of days of after school play and I feel we have wasted 60 bucks--But oblivion is worth the money!!I also don't mind watching him play the game-the more skilled he gets the stronger the monsters are that are sent against him so he has to work harder--there are also consequences for actions in this game- breaking the rules can affect you making it harder to get through the game--also diffrent actions can affect what weapons and tresures you find through out the game -it isn't always the same
1,She is no longer Julieta,"I remember when her music was really something. Since she was in Chantaje I knew she was special. This album is all happy-feely. Since Bueninvento I saw this coming. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad she is a happy person now. But it has affected her music and obviously her lyrics. If you're a die hard fan of hers, I guess you'll like this album. I don't."
1,What happened??? Que paso???,"What happened to Julieta Venegas? After two great CDs, she released this worthless CD. Everything is terrible about this album: from the cover to the music. She definitely went pop on this one.Que le paso a Julieta Venegas? Despues de dos CDs buenos, sale con este disco que no vale nada. Todo de este disco es terrible desde la portada hasta la musica. El disco es muy pop.I want the old Julieta back. Rock mata pop!"
3,Scratched disc in set,"Arrived quickly and packaged well. One of the set's disc is scratched and doesn't play well, but it only effects one episode."
1,Bad Sound on Instant Video,"At full volume on the browser and speaker or headphones, I still have to strain to hear. Other Amazon Instant Videos do not have this problem."
2,good series,I enjoy watching and rewatching the true blood series. But the books are better. There is so much passion in the series and lots of adventure. This is a good series. I can't wait for season 4 to come out on hbo.
1,Too Many Plots,"I really enjoyed watching season 1 and 2, but I was very disappointed with season 3. It was so disjointed--too many plots."
3,Not as good as the Books,"Great price and great shipping. No complaints about that. In some of the stores it was $40-60. However I did not like the storyline as well as I did in the first 2 seasons. I don't know why they have to stray so far away from the books. The books have a lot better storyline. I guess HBO thinks they know best. My recommendation is to order the Sookie Stackhouse series from Amazon and read those.Sookie Stackhouse 8-copy Boxed Set (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood)However, I have to admit that I am dreading the fact that I will have to wait probably a year or so for Season 4 to come out."
5,Best season yet!,"Great season, great discs! Finally Eric is coming to the forefront! I can watch them over and over to get my TB fix before the new season starts!"
3,Trueblood season 3,"Awesome dvds. Theres a few skips on a couple episodes, but it wasn' t too bad, im not worried about. Im pretty satisyed with my purchase. Fast shipping."
1,too far.,"I enjoyed the first season...it was interesting, witty, original.the second season was a bit graphic..but the third season is beyond graphic, it isnt' funny, it isn't interesting; it's a gore fest from start to finish. Gore for gore's sake. I not only couldn't stand watching it, I had to get it out of the house, I couldn't stand the sight of the box. The thing that finally put me over the edge was the graphic burning of a man that didn't die but walked around with horrid black burns and red eyes...it's disgusting.I would recommend it to sociopaths..Otherwise, skip it."
2,didnt receive case.,i just recieved the dvds not a case. the dvds are in good condition but i go this to go with a set and a case would have been nice. they all play and are good quality and super fast shipping.
5,Great series.,"If you have watched the first 2 seasons you will love this one just as much if not more. Just go ahead and buy it if that's the case.I'm not sure who else would be looking at buying this, but you definitely want to watch the first 2 seasons before watching this one."
3,true blood,its a good series. they kinda trimed down the interaction between sookie and alcide. seems like they kinda toned down the sexi ness of the series. i mean its true blood. nobody really expects tameness in true blood do they. i know they can;t put everything that happened in a book. but heres hoping season 4 is amazing. i love true blood the books i can't wait for the new book.
4,"Better than season two, in my opinion.","I really enjoyed this third season. I didn't even buy season two on DVD because I couldn't stand Mary-Anne and her plot. I agree with other reviews that there were too many new characters this season, but I thought the main Eric-Bill-Russel storyline and the complications of Sookie's identity more than made up for that. Denis O'Hare (Russel Edginton) was by far the highlight of the season for me. What amazing acting! I also loved learning more about Jessica. Loved that she and Hoyt got back together, but that ending with the two of them in their new house was ominous. While I adore Bill and Sookie together, I'd really like to see what Sookie and Eric become as a real couple, not the will-they, won't-they dance. I suppose we'll see next season, season 4 can't come soon enough!Oh, and can't forget:Eric: What?Pam: Blah, blah... vampire emergency. Blah."
1,"TERRIBLE ON ROKU..,,",..keeps getting disconnected evey 10 minutes. however netflix and other instants play fine on roku. will never buy amazon instant again.
5,Russell and Eric made this series special for me.,"I really loved S3 of TB. Season 2 seemed so convoluted with their multiple plotlines that very little made any sense at all. I don't want to even start talking about how misused Marianne was in S2. But in this season , Russell Edgington added something so great to the story that you didn't want it to end. I also loved that Eric had more screen time as well as Lafayette. Franklin and Tara's relationship was just so entertaining, he was really psychotic. I can't wait to see what more S4 has in store. (That rhymed, didn't it. LOL)"
4,True Blood: Season 3,Amazingly fast shipping! The only problem I had was in one episode the words were not matchingup with the characters mouths. But other than everything was great!
2,Not too great,I bought this for my husband. The vallet does not close properly after putting things and started to rip from folding ppoints. It's not very practical and the quality is also not great.
4,Good choice.,Just as showed and would expect. A really good fun toy for the kids to play with outdoors. A good lesson on how air works also.
4,Best Nostaligic All in one around,I have had the Crosley 73 in Oak for about 3 years. Love it - the tone quality is great - does everything I want and in such an attractive functional piece of furnishing. Always gets compliments and always being ask where did I get it. Looking for a cabinet for it now. Glad I purchased.
4,The Best of Peters and Lee,"The best song on the album of course is ""Welcome Home"".No doubt about it.The album was well worth the purchase price to be able to hear that great song again.There are several more on the CD that are very good but none will compare to their signature song.Great artists always have that one song they can never top such as Ann Murray's ""Snowbird"" or Billy Joel's ""Piano Man"".Peters and Lee never topped ""Welcome Home"".Unfortunately Peters died in 1993 of cancer but his music lives on.Buy this album.You will be glad you did.Frank from Springville,Alabama."
3,use it or loose it,"In this book it shows both hands gripping the stick at once that ties up your free hand which goes against arnis ,escrima principle ,the free hand should stay near your heart/chest or free hand could counter and return. If one does use both hands the one will hold the strick the other grips with a c clamp with opening toward opponent for stick will have an open path to target. If free hand remains out unprotected one may loose it."
5,Good Quality,"I was happy with the product sent to me, the color matched the accents of the interior of my car and I was very pleased with the ease, fit, and feel of the wheel cover, very soft, like broken in leather!"
3,A little disappointing,"Many people rate this as the ""greatest"" of the Marx films. I was disappointed. There were too many romantic sub-plots, pointless musical numbers and not enough of the Marx Brothers. Not as good as some of their Paramount films"
4,this is where u must start,"This dvd has got 2 be in your collection if u like MMA. Ufc1 is where it all started,Don't come in looking for 15 minute long fights u'll be sorely disappointed. What this dvd shows is that some styles just are fairly useless in a street fight, which ufc1 was (no rules!!) it gives u a chance to see guys that specialise in one single art..other than now where everybody is a grappler.... and it also shows royce gracie's american coming out party...trust me watch this dvd and see why this guy became feared and a legend!"
5,Great to see the Past,I have been dieing to be able to get this on DVD. I love the original fights. This shows Royce Gracie at his best and also the start of the feud between Royce and Ken Shamrock! This is a must for any Martial Arts fan!
2,UFC Classics Vol. 1,A lot more talking and other filler thanactual fighting action. This would makea great thirty minute video if edited downto the actual action.
2,LAME,"Not as good as I remember. I live in denver, and I was at the very first ufc at mcnichols arena. It was better left to my memory! If you are a fan of the ufc today do not buy this, it's not the same. All it is is a bunch of rejects swinging at each other, only to be choked out by royce gracie at some point. The guys on this dvd have no idea what they were getting into fighting a grapler like royce."
3,tough read,"Marlowe is sitting in his office swatting at a fly when Sweet Polly Purebread from Kansas strolls in carrying her Bible and sob story about a lost brother. Something doesn't smell right to Marlowe and you guessed it, it does stink.Chandler paints beautiful scenes as always in his unique hardboiled style, with Marlowe wisecracking like a pro. But the reader needs to keep notes to keep up with the dizzying cast of characters in this difficult to read story. I think this one is about as hard as The Big Sleep, which according to lore, was so complicated that even Chandler didn't know who killed one of the characters. Consider this a thinking man's whodunnit."
4,Great,I originally thought it was going to be songs from the movie unrleased. But its still great all the same. Thank you!
4,Donna Summer's Ultimate Collection,"I bought this to replace well used records. Good sound, best voice of the disco era. I have 13 version's of MacArthur Parks, and her's is the best."
5,"Simple, straightforward, and easy to use!","I bought this stroller for a recent trip to NYC with our two-year-old girl. It was simple, straghtforward, and easy to use! It looks nice, is lightweight, and our daughter fell asleep in it like a charm. It has one recline position, which a lot of the simpler (and cheaper) stroller don't have. I'd definitely recommend this stroller over the Maclaren Volo, which costs twice as much. The wheels are also nice and big, making strolling over bumps a breeze. The shade does slip off easily; but, if you use the velcro and watch out for it, it's not really a problem. (You may want to take the shade off when you check the stroller at the gate before a flight though.)"
2,Good only if child sits still all the time!,"I bought this stroller about 7 months ago. The cloth where the childs legs dangle wore off completely on the corners (where the aluminum bars are)! I ended up having to buy another stroller! If your child can't sit still and wants to stretch his/her legs behind the foot rest...this stroller is not appropriate!Also the wires that hold the canopy got twisted by the handlers at the airport!Although there are some pros like price, weight, and rugged wheels the cons for me still outweigh the pros.Cons:1.It gave out by 7 months2.Little storage space under chair3.The recline doesnt really recline all that much4.When walking my feet would always bump into the wheels5. Handles were not tall enough for me (I am 5'7"")6. Fabric wore off (worse yet when I was shopping for the new stroller at the store I noticed the Capri stroller example was torn exactly where mine was!)"
1,Piece of Crap .. Don't Buy!!!!!!,"I read the reviews. I have a toddler and, after I read the reviews, I was prepared to experience difficulty in turning the wheels. (I did, that review was totally accurate) I was not prepared for it to break after only two uses. There is a metal bar that extends out to hold the seat. It broke on the left hand side. I looked down at my little guy and he was standing on his left foot on the footrest and I couldn't figure out why .. well it turned out that the seat broke right out from underneath him. He weighs less than thirty pounds .. he's not a giant or anything. What a cheap piece of doo doo .. I would never buy another product from this company and especially NOT this stroller. It's not even as attractive as it in the pics .. what a huge disappointment."
2,Not so great if you're tall...,"This seemed like a neat umbrella stroller, but I'm tall (6'0"") and I kept kicking the wheels and had to hunch a little to push it, so I will be returning it. I also found the buckle a bit awkward to use, and the sunshade was too close to my daughter's head, which bothered her."
5,couples night,"we have been playing this game for several years. we bought a second game for our second home. we got another couple hooked on this game & we play teams, girls against the guys. it makes for an interesting, stimulating, lots of laughs, evening."
4,Mind exercise for seniors.,"The size of this game is ideal for those of age who may have vision problems. As simple as the game may be, it requires much concentration on offense as well as defence. Thus, execising ones mind."
5,excellent game,I bought this game for some fun with other couples...it is exactly as described and the surface is easy to clean. recommend this to anyone who likes games.
5,Awesome,Anthony's voice is amazing. He is truely the Angel of Music!! I own all of his CDs and had to get this one. A Must have for Anthony Fans.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"MR.WARLOW HAS A BIG BEAUTIFUL VOICE,BUT IT'S NOT USED ON THIS CD.....THE ""BIG"" IS LEFT OUT..TO BAD...I BOUGHT 3 OF HIS CD'S ALL THE SAME VERY LITTLE VOICE USED!..THE BIG SOUND OF HIS VOICE IS NOT THERE I WONTBUY HIM AGAIN....BOB L.P.S.I AM 60 YEARS OLD..."
3,He's definitely not his Dad.,"I eagerly awaited the release of this latest in the ""Chronicles"", and was somewhat disappointed. There are many inconsistencies in the book, which many of the other reviewers have pointed out. The hunger for the series kept me ""with it"" until the end, and will probably make me buy the next installment (House Harkonnen), but Frank Herbert's talents are sorely missed. Brian's collaboration with his father (Man of Two Worlds) foreshadowed his talent, but with strong input from ""Dad"", outshined this offering."
3,An Introduction to Dune,"This is a prequel written by Frank Herbert's son, Brian and Kevin Anderson. It takes place during the Old Duke's (Leto) coming of age and tells us about the Atreides, the Harkonnens, the Ix and a little more about the Navigation Guild. This novel is a good telling of the history surrounding Dune. It is more accessible and, thus, less intimating than the Dune series. It seems that it would be a good introduction to Dune, but it is not quite up to the master. I will be reading House Harkonnen and House Corrino."
1,"Parts of Ideas, no development","This book really disappoints. The Dune series was definitely guilty of giving you ready-made people and scenarios, but the telling was what held your interest; you wanted to learn more about these people. The same sense sticks with you in House Atreides, but remains unrequited, because the novel does little to hold your interest (there are only thin plot-lets) and the figures of your favorite characters have lost their dynamic unfolding in the retelling. More a 'Did you Know' handbill of factoids on the original Dune than a true tale, despite its generous length. Only for the Herbert family die-hards."
4,It's probably worth your time.,"Sure we all wish Frank Herbert had lived to finish his Dune series, but he didn't and this is the closest you're going to get so just start grinning and bearing it, okay? ;-)If you didn't make it through Herbert's original 6 books, don't start with this one, because the master himself definitely tells the story best, but if you're like me and have read pretty much everything the man ever wrote, just can't possibly get enough Frank Herbert, this is definitely worth your time.Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson do a credible job of bringing Frank Herbert's characters and universe back from the dead. The book is a ""prequel"" to the original series, and further good news is that there are clear hints that there will be at least one additional prequel book and a ""postquel"" book as well."
1,The Test: Human or Animal?,"I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from this book and drop it in the toilet. If you do so you will die.I survived nine full pages before the pain became too much & would certainly have chosen death rather than to continue reading.Shame, shame, shame on the authors.There was a Victorian chappie, name of Bowdler, who attempted to 'improve' Shakespeare, giving rise to the term 'Bowdlerism'. Could I suggest 'Andersonism', meaning to talentlessly and shamelessly cash-in on someone else's genius?Lovers of Dune will know what I mean. Kull Wahad!The Bene Gesserit had a good word for it. Abomination."
2,Doesn't live up to the originals,"I was beyond excited to hear of a new addition to Herbert's Dune universe. I bought the book before it came out and I read it with an intense hope of reconnecting to the world that stunned me years ago. I was unfortunately disappointed. The book was generally simplistic. It did not have the same complexities, intrigue, or language as the orginal. It was nice to revisit the characters and the plots, but it did not ""say"" anything, unlike the original Dune series. It was pulp through and through. In addition, the shameless drive throughout the book to leave enough loose ends so young Herbert could write a second book and recieve more lucrative book deals was upsetting. It seemed that some parts were written so a next book could be written, not to enhance House Atreides itself. Read it if you are a fan, but do not expect the original."
2,"Not bad pulp SF, but not Dune...","Not bad. Okay, so that isn't the finest way to start a review, but it's the best way to start this novel - not bad. It's far from stunning, and far from a Dune book - far from being what is considered ""proper"" science fiction! - but it is good if accepted as a fairly simplistic action-adventure sci-fi novel aimed at a predominantly teenage audience. There are a not inconsiderable number of inconsistencies with Frank Herbert's original Dune Chronicles, but these aside, D:HA is fun at a base level. If I were to enter into honest criticism, I would cite weak characters and poor research as my main gripes. However, apart from this, D:HA is a fair (if oversized) read."
3,Hungry for more?,"If your looking for the mysticism and philosophy that was trademark of Frank Herbert, you wont find it here. Well written, but doesnt capture the mood of the originals. Worth the read if your a fan of the Imperium though."
1,"""House Atreides"" is ""Dune Lite""","While I didn't expect this book to be on a par with Frank Herbert, I wasn't prepared for how spectacularly ordinary it is. The most missed element is Herbert's didactic, multi-layered prose style. Herbert had a way of saying more by implication than by actual description. ""House Atreides"" is just plain bland by comparison. Some of the descriptive metaphors wouldn't be worthy of a freshman creative writing student (the bull falling over like a spaceship, for instance). Most of the characters and situations are described or implied in other Dune works. In most cases, they are not better served by being fleshed out. Ix, for example, is a much more provactive and interesting place because it was never explicitly described in the other Dune books; the reader is left to imagine and fill in the possibilities. ""Dune"" is a book that most people grow into. ""House Atreides"" is, regretfully, one that you'll have to dumb down for."
2,"NOT BAD, BUT DEFINITELY NOT GREAT- A FUN & EASY READ....","Actually, it's an excellent watering-down of Frank Herbert's classic series, skillfully designed for the lucrative young teens market. The adult reader is left with no doubt that young Herbert did it for the bucks. Will serious sci-fi lovers find any of it to be exciting, awe-inspiring or mind-expanding (as the first Dune was)? Not likely; however, the return to the elder Herbert's world still made for a fun afternoon's read. Despite the many ""historical"" mistakes (see the other reviews), still makes for good ""bathroom reading"" on a par with the Star Wars books. Give it to your young teen for Xmas."
3,"Okay, but not great","I found that as a suppliment to the dune series, it fell far short. However, I feel this is because it was not written by Frank Herbert himself. I aggree that the ""no-ship"" technology came out of no where. I also felt that to much emphasis was placed on description and not enough on long reaching plot and character development. Otherwise it was an entertaining read"
4,Really good story.,The back information on the Dune universe was very good. I really enjoyed this book.
2,"Fun, Enjoyable read - keep it at that!","I enjoyed reading the D:HA for what it was. I must admit I agree with other reviewers that it is simplistic when compared with FH's work, but that's part of it's charm for all the 5 star folk. It ( and the sucessors ) apparently are going to simply explain lots of the references which were left to the readers imagination in the original works. Which happened to be one of the reasons I liked the original Dune so much.The characters did seem more simpler. For example: Fenrig is portrayed as a sadistic assasin... yet my take from the originals his assasinations were to further a goal, dispassionately and clinically... not enjoyably.I hope that they'll complete the other 2 prequels for the fun of it... but pass the baton on to other folk to work on postquel books. Bear/Brin/Benford seem like candidates to *expand* on FHs work, rather than just extend it. <grin> Particularly given the last cryptic chapter of Chapterhouse."
4,My first Dune book!,"I'm only on page 513, and I can tell you, THIS IS A GOOD SCI-FI BOOK!This is a must have for Dune fans, Herbert fans, or just plain sci-fi fans!This story blends in 3 heroes great tales.Leto Atriedies leaves his home on Caladan to learn the mechanics of the robotic world known as Ix.Pardot Knyes,a planetologist, is on a mission from the emperor Elrood IX to see Fremen history,and an 8-year-old Duncan Idaho is hunted down by Harkonenns in a cruel game of tag which Duncan wants to escape.As the book said ""This will make all 3 renegades, and shapers of history.""True Enough!Baron Vladimir Harkonenn is in this book too(A little note for Dune readers)The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's a fast book.The chapters just whiz by.But still,my favorite sci-fi book! Maturity level:15+ END"
2,Make Sure You're Looking for Info on OFFSHORING - not OUTSOURCING,"Offshoring and Outsourcing just got jumbled again in the American vocabulary. The Offshore Nation is written by experts on the Indian BPO marketplace. If thats what you're trying to understand, this book is very helpful. If your goal is limited to large corporation, call center projects or transaction processing, this book is very helpful.For all other areas of Outsourcing, I highly recommend you read any one of the other books who don't confuse offshoring and outsourcing better than Lou Dobbs."
4,A ladder of her own!,"I am so happy to be able to change my own light bulbs and smoke detector batteries. This ladder is lightweight enough for me to drag outside for window washing. It's now stuck in my outdoor storage shed after being hauled through a bit of mud. But that washed off easily. I like the little hole in the tray for pushing a paper towel through. Even though I am a bit on the heavy side, this stepladder is easy to stabilize. This is a keeper!"
3,Great if you've bought into this lifestyle,"This book is for those of you who have decided to switch to an all living foods diet. It has creative recipes made with a juicer, a food processor, a dehydrator, and an electric skillet. You will need to buy these to get much out of the book. For this reason, the raw foods dabbler may want to start with another cookbook."
2,Predictable,"Oceans Apart is a Christian fiction book focused on forgiveness. At the center is a delightful little boy and Kingsbury really does an exceptional job capturing the boy's voice. However, I found the plot to be predictable and a little preachy. The adult characters were also not very realistic or engaging."
3,Mexican revolution lives of the composinos that it affected,"I read this book at Thundird Graduate school while taking Spanish. It is a wonderful but dificult book to read in Spanish, due to the vocabulary and slang used through out the book. It does how ever give you a taste if the suffering of the indiginous population during that period. It is a wonder that having lived in mexico for 4 years and traveled trough many rural 'pueblitos' that life has not really changed for indiginous population. Actually there are 128 different languages spoken in the country.I had decided to read it since my father in law was part of the revolution and used to be part of the 'villistas', so he provided colaborating evidence also of those times."
5,Favorite Horn,"This disc has the trademark Horn stylings, including her inimitable pace and phrasing. It is the most upbeat of her usually ballad-dominated discs, giving off a smoking heat and bluesy tinge that mark this record as unique amidst her notable ouevre. The immediacy of the recording process pays off in the feel of the album. She is a singer par excellence and a talented pianist. This disc is highly recommended."
1,2.1 GB not 20 GB,If you check the large picture the drive says 2.1 GB. Makes sense because I don't think the bios supports 20 GB
5,Best book I've ever read,"I have read this book at least 15 times in the last 20 years. I underline things as I go and review it when I feel a bit lost in life. I have bought 10 copies as I keep lending it out and it doesn't come back (which is ok with me - I'm just happy it's helping someone else!) BTW movie was pretty good too, very well done, true to the book."
4,Change your life,"A friend gave me this book and I passed it along to a friend and she has since passed it along to another friend. I think that says it all. It does change lives.A friend who has since passed on this book to yet another person asked me to include the fact that its not exceptionally well written and and is a little hokey. However, she still likes the message."
3,Is there a quicker way?,"Interesting fictional account of a ""re-awakening"", but I must say it was neither a self-help book nor a great piece of fiction. It was somewhere in the middle. I kept waiting for it to get more believeable and it never made it.A better fictional journey of discovery would be Saul Bellow's ""Henderson the Rain King"", while a better self-help book would be anything by Anthony Robbins."
5,Dan is the Man!,"Not only was this an easy read, but it was entertaining, it made you think and it has some life changing ideas. I thought this was, by far, Millman's best effort. May Socrates live on!"
1,Pure Garbage,"I picked up this book because i had read that Phil Jackson had passed it on to one of his players in order to send a message. I wish i had never read that article about Phil, because i wasted 2 weeks try to get through that book. I am a very fast reader usually, but the horrible writing and the ridiculousness of the story just kept making me put the book down. I really wanted to throw the book away, but i kept searching and hoping for some great revelation, so i eventually finished it. How do i feel now? Like i wish i could get that portion of my life back. The message was hokey, the story telling was stupid, and the writing was garbage. Did i really need to read 200 pages to understand Dan's message of living in the moment and being happy? Nope. One paragraph would have been sufficient.Even if you have an IQ of 75 and are a remedial read at best,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,unrealistic,Lost from the beginning when Socrates magically jumped onto the roof and all the magic that followed. will review again when i have time but just couldn't buy into it because it wasn't plausible to me.
2,satisfied with the storytelling but not with the overall philosophy.,"The reason i bought this book was because i liked the element of 'living in the present' which was displayed in the film, so i wanted to dig deeper by reading the book. Reading through the book i enjoyed the easy-to-read and high detail explanation of the main character's journey. But as i went deeper into the book i just noticed that it was obviously 'New Age', now that is something most people won't argue about, and i don't hate some of the truths in it, but i don't like the overall of that 'religion'. So even though i like the author's storytelling and some of the philosophy (like the one of living in the present) i don't go into the 'new age' being a christian. I can read a story of metaphors, but when the author makes the story into an obvious religion which contradicts mine, i can't go further. Now to end this review, i was satisfied with the storytelling and detailing but not with the overall philosophy."
5,Incredible book,This is a life changing book for anyone that takes it seriously. I would recommend this as well as Millman's other books in this series.
2,"Ah, Buddhism with extra Californian cheese and heart-breaking first-world problems","This book is certainly not without its fine points of wisdom, mostly recycled, but you have to grind your way through layers and layers of cheese before you get to them. At the end, it won't leave a good taste in your mouth.It is hard to sympathize or relate to the woes of the main character who is a born world class champion without really trying, without having to sleep, rich enough to do and travel wherever he wants since his freshman year, doesn't have to study ever, can basically seduce and have any girl he ever wants on a whim and still is chosen among millions apparently by a Zen master of unlimited power to be trained into perfection. His trials and anguishes to ""find himself""and his obsession with his happiness while giving zero concern to the welfare of the world at large are truly heartbreaking first-world problems.It doesn't help that the author is a mediocre writer at best. Take a pass on this one."
2,Many Questions,This book had many strong moments as well as weak moments. The points it tries-to- make at times were hard to follow.
1,westward the women dvd,The dvd was for Europe (I didn't notice that). I returned the dvd but still have not rec'd a refund. I'm not happy.This company is difficult to deal with! I still am looking for this dvd in English and able to be shown in the USA.
4,"Next time, take the train","An all-girl wagon train? That's the idea, and somebody must have caught the great director William Wellman in a genial mood when he agreed to direct this. It's a measure of his tremendous talent that Wellman actually made something enjoyable out of an utterly absurd script. A motley assemblage of mail-order brides heading to California are abandoned by their hired male teamsters thanks to trail boss Robert Taylor's poor people skills. Instead of high-tailing it back to St. Joe the fiances push on by themselves, with mixed results. Several dozen make it across, however, and face the far greater perils of marrying complete strangers. Taylor, one of Hollywood's most under-rated talents, is absolutely great, and the large female ensemble acquit themselves very well. As usual with a Wellman picture, phenomenal photography."
3,Hot-head Taylor Pushes Women Onward,"Robert Taylor is the no-nonsense wagonmaster of a big ole group of women who have signed on to be the mail-order brides of a bunch of bachelor frontiersmen in California. An interesting assortment of women, some widows and some prostitutes as well as other women who for whatever reason have no prospects back east. Not so keen on Taylor, though, as to me he always seems like he's acting--I don't find him believable or immersed in his role. This movie could've been a lot better if someone else were in this role. Lots of drama for the women, as they must put up with Indian fights, deserting menfolk, floods, thirst and hunger, deaths, births, and having to move their wagons up and down harsh terrain by their own (wo)manpower. Some reviewers find it a good feminist movie, but I take exception to Taylor's rough treatment of his reformed prostitute love interest as anti-woman."
1,Broken ladder foot,"This is a great ladder, but it arrived with a severely twisted foot making it unusable safely. I can find NO contact information for ordering a replacement foot and no way to contact the seller. I need help!!! This product is not a great value when it can't be used. All other aspects of this transaction were great."
3,Just ok,"I bought two of these chair covers to replace my worn-out ones. They're not especially sturdy, as one of them ripped after a slightly heavyset person (~200 lbs) sat in it. They also don't have a drain hole grommet at the bottom, so if left out in the weather, water will pond in the seat and eventually rot it. My previous chair covers had grommets in them, and that extended their life immeasurably. I guess these are not bad for the price, but don't expect super high quality."
3,If you love Bobbi Brown... it's okay...,"I was a tad dissapointed. The commentary is interesting, accurate, and worth the read. But I would have liked to have seen more applications... possibly diagrams and the like."
5,The last makeup book you'll need,"This is the last makeup book you will ever need. Basic information, clearly written, from an experienced make up pro. And the pictures are delectable. I bought Bobby Brown's make up book for teens for my neice and as a result she has never looked more beautiful. Bobby Brown knows what she is talking about."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this book based almost solely upon Bobbi Brown's name -- big mistake. Unfortunately, the beauty advice is very incomplete; chapters are only a few pages on average.Buy Victoria Jackson's ""Make Up Your Life"" instead. Same subject material but MUCH more depth."
2,Not What I Expected,"If you're looking for a book that shows you technique to achieve that certain look you've always wondered how to do - forget this book. I feel the book does have valuable info on correcting application errors, etc. and the model pictures (made up) are lovely, but the book is long winded and lacks visual demonstration of technique."
2,The Ultimate Resource--for hearing about Bobbi's opinions!!,"DON'T BOTHER with this book if you: 1. Want to learn how to apply make-up (try a Kevin Aucoin book for that--he's the best!). 2.

4,Brought me to the Congo,"The characters were very well developed. The book came to a peak once the plot unfolded but I felt let down by the ending. It was great to learn about the Congo, and the people, and the culture, and especially the struggles of missionaries in that time. Don't let the word ""Bible"" in the title turn you away from this book!"
2,Disappointed,"I would recommend this book as a source for intereting information about Africa, but if you appreciate nuanced characters and a realistic plot, I wouldn't waste my time with this book.I enjoyed some of Kingsolver's previous novels, but I found this book to be completely phony. Each person in this book seems to be not a character but a mouthpiece to demonstrate ""good"" or ""evil."" The good characters (Leah) respect different cultures and adapt to them, while the bad characters (the father, Rachel) are racist and provincial. It is very simplistic. Because I couldn't relate to the pure good or evil of any of the characters, I wasn't much interested in their story. It just seemed to be trying too hard."
5,Simply Wonderful!,I can barely describe adequately the immense pleasure I derived from reading this novel--I literally could not put it down! Kingsolver does a marvelous job of bringing the characters to life and truly creates a novel that is a joy to read.
1,Depressing - not up lifting,"This book is long on words, and moves very slow. It is not a very up beat book. I found half way through, I skipped around and never even finished it."
4,Culture shocking,"Here is a family that is not prepared for what awaits them with they go to the Belgian Congo as missionaries. The cake mix that mom smuggles in has turned to a brick when she wants to prepare it for her daughter's birthday. I read this book about a year ago and I can still see the place where they lived in my mind's eye. The garden that failed. The villagers in the tattered clothing. Each character had her own distinct and interesting voice. My one criticism would be that the father was a bit of a mystery. Why was he so unbending? What was his suffering? Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend this book or run to the library for her next book."
1,Good work BUT STILL..,"NO I did not buy this book. Found it with a friend, but could not get passed half way through. I guess for somebody of my taste its just too 'feel good' book."
2,Obviously overrated author and work,"I don't like Kingsolver's work but was persuaded by the many positive reviews to try yet again. What a waste of time. These characters are so flat and unbelievable--esp. the tyrannical father. I mean, I know that kids often perceive their parents in this way, but are parents really like this? I don't think so. Moreover, I felt like the role of the Congo in this story was a gimmick--this story could just as well have been told in an American setting, which Kingsolver could have done more believably, because she apparently needs a bibliography to prove to her readers that she knows something about the Congo. It was hard to like or sympathize with the characters or believe in what they were going through."
1,Horrible,This book was horrible I wouldn't give it a 1 star but there is no zero don't waste your time or money on it. It just drags. Yes the Congo was an important part or the work history but putting it into the perspective of Christanity was too much....and slightly offinsive if you ar not a chirstian as I am not
5,Fantastic,"This book is an intriguing look into the lives of the wife and four daughters of a fascist preacher intent on converting the Congolese people to his form of religion. As though reading a continuing journal, each of the five women tells their own story of the trials and tribulations they were forced to endure during their time in the Congo. Interwoven with historical facts, vivid descriptions of the people and places, this is a wonderful book. Barbara Kingsolver is a fantastic storyteller, and I recommend this book to everyone."
3,A Must Read - So I'm Told.,"Members of my book club were impressed by this work, and most stated that it was the best book that they had read in the last 20 years. With that, I eagerly picked-it-up but after fifty pages could not wait to put-it-down."
3,Nice way to pass the time,"This book is a nice way to pass the time. The description or the Congo are good enough to make you believe you've been there. If there was a lesson to be learned from all of the preaching however, I'm afraid it was lost on me. For the life of me I can't imagine what ending I was expecting but it certaily wasn't the ending she came up with."
2,Doesn't Live Up To The Hype,"I think a lot of people just assume that if Oprah recommended a book that it must be wonderful. I had heard so much about this particular book that once I finally got around to it, I was expecting an inspiring and enlightening story of strong women and a new insight into Africa. I found that it was none of these things. I thought that for most of the book the women were exceedingly weak. In the later half, I didn't find their lives believable in the least. I persevered to the end, but felt that Kingsolver didn't live up to her potential in this disappointingly long effort."
4,Good....with reservations.,"This was the first Kingsolver book I'd ever read. Several of my college professors were reading it and talking about it, so I decided to give it a try. Having lived overseas myself as the child of missionary parents, some of the issues in the book hit very close to home. I understood the cultural faux pas and the shock of moving to a strange new world, and Kingsolver's portrayal of these things was believable. It is not the best written book I've ever read. The multiplicity of voices at times makes for a rather cluttered narrative, and some of the word play gets a bit annoying. The techniques Kingsolver uses are not highly original, but it is a good read because of the conflicts it presents"
4,Worthy Reading,Really good book! Interesting to read from all different family member view points. Definitely an eye opener on the situation in the Congo! I recommend it
4,Belgian Congo Historical Novel,"A solid book. To me one of the most interesting parts of the book were the political chaos scenes depicting the history of the Belgian Congo. I knew little of modern Central Afican history, this presented a clear picture of U.S. foriegn involement in preventing communism, African culture, the end of the colonialist era, and the emotions of the Congolese in that turbulent time.Kingsolver did her research. If you are interested in the Congo or books about imprisonment, I'd read this over ""Heart of Darkness"" any day."
3,Did not live up to recommendations,"This book was recommended to me many times, so finally I got around to reading it. While Kingsolver's language is deft and skillful - I have read more than a few who fall short of her level - the book disappointed me. As a Christian myself, I found it hard to swallow that stereotype of a Baptist preacher that Reverend Price was. My favorite character was Leah, but I couldn't really relate to her any more than the others. Also, after the Price women left the village, the book seemed to plod. The rest just seemed to be a long, long, ending. Looking back on what I wrote, I realize I sound very critical so I will say that Kingsolver is a better writer than many will be. I think it is just that I received such glowing recommendations and I was let down."
4,"Liked it, but not as much as her other books!","When I saw it in the book store, I decided that I had to buy it, even though it had not come out in paperback (not a grad student anymore). I've loved Ms. Kingsolver's lyrical descriptions, wonderful ways of showing the love of native people of the southwest and how her characters deal with community. I believe all she wrote about the political situation, the family of fundamentalist missionaries, the naivety, etc. A bit predictable from my point of view (mainline denomination pastor). She is indeed a great visionary. But I missed the small moments of love that enchanted me in Pigs in Heaven, Animal Dreams, and The Bean Trees, the ways that folk do redeem their lives with love. I guess I felt this didn't have the same measure. Yes, there is a romance, but this one left me untouched, and I'm not sure why. Do read it, but don't expect the same Kingsolver."
3,"Voices were wonderful, but story lacked structure","I have read and absolutely loved all of Kingsolver's previous works, especially The Bean Trees, and I must admit I expected something more out of the Poisonwood Bible. I did enjoy the multiple points of view and the vivid voices on the daughters in the family. Adah is a masterpiece in character development. But, other characters were disappointing. I was not raised by a baptist missionary nor was a child of the 50-60's, but I found the father hard to believe as a character. He never showed a speck of compassion for his wife or children, and I thought that was a grave mistake in character development. Most disappointing, however, was the story structure. The climax occurs approx 350 pages in, but I was forced to sit through an additional 200 pages of what seemed to be a prolonged ""wrapup."" And to top it all off, the last line of the book is a stale cliche."

One small step for man: One giant leap for mankind.""Miss Soledad O'BrienMiss Tongila CulbrethMiss Dena Heller Millman Bat-YaacovMiss Robin RobertsMiss Diane Sawyer"
2,Can't get into it.,"I had high hopes for this book, although it being an Oprah book has nothing to do with it. My friend recommended it to me with stellar reviews, so I jumped in, only to be bored, sleepy, and plain uninterested, After multiple attempts to be entertained, I gave up.Simply: it's a bore."
1,Live Adah Had A Evil,"Barbara Kingsolver's complicated novel of a profoundly dysfunctional family meddling disasterously in affairs where they had no business was so depressing I was glad I only paid twenty five cents for it at a yard sale.She flung out beautiful, poetic prose like so much mud scattering from a bull floundering in a dried-up mudhole. The more she heaped on the uglier it got. Such a waste.She insulted people who have sacrificed their very lives for the people of the Congo and glorified characters from history who failed them. She insulted the United States of America. She insulted missionaries of every faith.Her attempt to cast a failed political system in a favorable light failed utterly."
5,Barbara Kingsolver's Best,The Poisonwood Bible is the best work yet of Barbara Kingsolver. The story is set in the Congo with a missionary family struggling to find its place in this fierce country. The writing is masterful. Kingsolver writes eloquently from four characters' points of view and conveys the nuances of each of their personalities in an astounding way. This book can stand up against Hemingway and Steinbeck in its beauty and depth. It is now being read in various high schools in California and I believe it to be her best novel yet.
3,"Great Start, Lousy Finish","This book starts out great and I was totally involved but it just runs out of steam in the second half as the characters become charicatures and the politics are crammed down our collective throats. Still, it's worth reading for the first half alone and you can just skim the rest."
3,The ending disappointed a bit,"The first part of the book was very interesting, however the ending was wierd. It did describe some fascinating situations and some pretty hard to believe situations! Wasn't one of my favorite books though."
5,beautiful,"This is Kingsolver's best novel. It's a masterpiece with none of the uncertainties of some of her earlier books. She has found an issue that she explores with great knowledge, compassion, realism, imagination, enthusiasm, zest, humor, sorrow and a personal touch. The story is involving, the characters are believable and politics are presented as they occur in reality -- integrated with the people's lives and having a sometimes tragic, sometimes positive impact. The novel also settles the question, once and for all, whether Ms. Kingsolver is a ""serious"" writer or not. She has shown here that she is not afraid to take on an issue of epic proportions, and I am sure she has enlightened many and infuriated some with this brave, wonderful book."
5,Priceless tribute to the power of language!,"A novel rich in its own lesson -- the power of language in religion, family systems and in writing! Characters and story teach us so much! Abuse of religion, family power, cultural power --all illustrated through the beautiful use of language and character in a setting that is interesting, rich and gripping. The message of this book translates across the culture in which it is set and into our own if we are willing to see it everywhere! Wonderful!"
4,Good or Bad Message?,"Overall I found the book very intriguing. I was interested in the Price family, as I am fascinated by missionary stories. However, I think that Barbara Kingsolver shows obvious disdain for the Christian Religion, making the missionary husband (Nathan Price) the main obsticle in the way of the Price women's survival. It seems as though Ms. Kingsolver has generalized Christians as arrogant know-it-alls from the Bible Belt. It is obvious from the very beginning that the Price family (and particularly Nathan) are in for a rude awakening. In fact, towards the end of the novel I found that all the characters were turned off by the very thought of Christianity, associating it with their deranged father and husband they left behind in the Congo. This is the feeling I believe the authoress was trying to create in her readers. By all means, enjoy this book! I know I did, but keep in mind that Christianity is in fact skewed toward a negative light."
3,"Read this book, but be critical","A novel about incredible endurance, with Reverend Price as a tragic figure who dominates the first half. Kingsolver is a gifted writer and the different voices are believable and compelling. I agree with others who thought the novel ran out of steam when Rev. Price disappeared from the narrative, and I had to plow through the last third. Also, I wish the character of Rachel were less of a stereotype and had shown some capacity for depth and change. It was disappointing that there was no confrontation between the two most interesting characters: the Reverend and Orleanna. An interesting book, but flawed."
3,Not Kingsolver's best,"I found this book a plodding, political, depressing read and wished I'd never picked it up. Kingsolver is an excellent writer but this story is definitely not her best."
3,"The Importance of ""Things""","I have never before read any of Barbara Kingsolver's books but was drawn to the title and subject of this book. It was not a book that kept me up all night (the reason mainly for my rating), however, it kept me thinking. She does an excellent job using the different views of the characters to portray the expierience of living in the Congo and being a minority in that area. There are many lessons to be learned from reading this book. The most important I found to be the lack of need for material things. ""Making do with what you have."" I also found myself VERY appreciative of the ease with which we can cook and buy food. I could go on and on, but perhaps you ought to pick up the book yourself. I will not take food for granted after reading this book!"
4,Thoroughly Engrossing,"An excellent study of a patriarch and his family as strangers in a strange land. If you know little of Africa in the early sixties, I highly recommend you read this novel. It's not a historical book, but it sheds light on a part of the world that we Americans don't spend enough time thinking about. I thought the narrative was excellent, particularly the character of Adah. She's one of the finest literary creations in a long time. As a whole, the novel doesn't let down although personally I wish the author would've either pared down the rush to cover almost 30 years' history towards the end or elaborated a little more thoroughly (especially in regards to Nathan). But don't let that stop you from experiencing a great American novel. It lingers on in your memory long after you've put it down."
3,The Poisonwood Bible,This is a very thought-provoking and intense novel. I highly recommend it. I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the condition of this softcover volume I purchased as it was not in the condition described. It also took over 3 weeks to get here. It is a good thing my book club decided to postpone our meeting this month!
4,THE POISONWOOD BIBLE,"WELL--THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW. THE FIRST TIME I FELT COMPELLED TO COMMENT ON SOMETHING I'VE READ AND TO RECOMMEND IT. THIS BOOK OPERATES ON SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS, A THNKING FICTION-LOVER HAS TO BE ENGAGED. THERE ARE INTERESTING, MOSTLY BELIEVABLE CHARACTERS, A FASCINATING STORY, NICE, SOLID WRITING, GREAT SCENIC DETAIL--WITHOUT GOING INTO LONG, OVERWROUGHT DESCRIPTIVE PASSAGES--INTERESTING COMMENTARY ON RELIGION, US FOREIGN POLICY, NEEDS VS. WANTS...IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SPEND YOUR TIME, AND MIGHT EVEN CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT LIFE, THE UNIVERSE, AND EVERYTHING."
4,"Well-written, well-researched, occasionally superficial","Kingsolver has done a marvelous job of researching her choice of setting. The jungle of Africa comes marvelously alive for the reader, and while I have no personal experience by which to compare her descriptions, still the landscape and its people are painted vividly and memorably. The author also does very well distinguishing four first-person narratives, which in itself is a daunting task. While the plot does seem to crumble (and drag on endlessly) in the last hundred pages or so, the momentum from the first two-thirds managed to propel me through to the end. I was most disappointed to find her treatment of religion and missionary work in general, to be surprisingly superficial. There are few (perhaps no) redeeming qualities in the characater of the father. His superficial (indeed, often cartoonish) characterization did detract slightly from my overall enjoyment of the book. On the whole, however, its an engaging read."
2,An excellent but way too biased author,"There is no doubt that Kingsolver can write, and certain descriptions of Africa and the world are quite excellent.However, she has the canny ability to show her political views with every character--a view that not all her readers may share.All the far-lefts are warm and friendly people while the far-rights are cold and unbending.I do not like the flatness of characters produced in doing so.There are bad and good democrats just as there are bad and good republicans.Adah, one of the daughters, is portrayed wonderfully. Definitely a perk of the book.I think this book is worth it in the end but I wouldn't read any thing else by Kingsolver from now on."
1,terrible...,"this book was just plain lousy. I have no idea what message she is trying to convey about missionaries or foreigner arrogance in the midst of the 'natives.' The only message that came across is that the missionaries are psychotic and the natives stupid, hardly a message worth reading about. The characters were two dimensional, especially the 'natives'. The setting was not fully realized and the plot never played through to a believable conclusion."
5,Amazing Story,"Loved this book. Couldn't put it down! At first I wasn't so sure I wanted to ready about a Baptist preacher/ missionary in Africa with his wife and 4 daughters. But after the first few pages I was totally entranced with the story.You really get to know the characters and they were so relatable, except for the father.This is a must read for anyone!"
5,WOW! WHAT A GREAT NOVEL.,"i received this as a gift, and was quickly drawn into the characters. this book is more of an experience than just reading. the author uses five different voices to tell the story, and it is truly fascinating. given, it is a different sort of book, but it was a welcome change from my regular reading."
4,Not your typical missionary tale,"All stories based in Africa deal with survival under extreme conditions (war, drought, floods, famine, disease, and infestations).This novel, however, is about overcoming the challenges that we find within ourselves. The extreme conditions of African village life are simply a backdrop to the internal struggles of a missionary family, the Price family, as each is transformed forever by the experience of life in Africa."
3,Correction,"My previous review (sent less than an hour ago) contained the statement.""What Baptist preacher anywhere in the world..."" I would like to qualify that with one single word to say, ""What fundamentalist Baptist preacher..."" The word, ""fundamentalist"" is essential."
2,I feel guilty not liking this book,"I'm a big Kingsolver fan and will read whatever she writes next. The Poisonwood Bible was a disappointment. An ambitious but failed effort. You could tell that she was trying very hard, had her heart in the right place, and was very well meaning. But for me, using the different voices as ""books"" of this bible didn't work because they didn't seem real and the book was disjointed. I liked her descriptions of the Congo, but actually expected more politics, especially after reading some of the reviews. Unlike her other books, this one felt forced, like she knew it wasn't working and just kept writing and writing hoping it would get better. I kept reading and reading, feeling the same way."
4,Beautiful Characterization,"I've just spent my vacation reading this book. The characters are each given a voice in each chapter. I loved the changing perspectives of the situations which each chapter brought.My only problem with the book was the ending. I felt that the author might have ended the book sooner; the book seemed to carry on forever in the very end. I felt that there was also too much space devoted to politics. All in all, however, this book is on the scale of The Thorn Birds, one of my favorites."
4,Pleased!,This book is enlightening to what happened to Africa back in the fifties. It also says something about do-gooder missionaries who went there to help out and lost out. I think mature young readers would appreciate this as a good novel to read.
1,Boring,"This book goes on and on and on and on. I couldn't buy into any of the characters. They had no substance. And the wife, move on already!"
1,Male Bashing 101,"Despite universal acclaim, I found the characters cartoonish and predictable. The world of men are bad and women endure and prevail does not represent a fictional world I'd like to enter nor the real world where I live. Dear old crazy dad, we made it despite him or because of him, but we couldn't, didn't, don't love him."
3,"Good, to a point","I had to read this book for school, so I honestly wasn't expecting much. However, I was pleasently suprised. I enjoyed reading a lot of the book. I loved the plot in the first half. I really connected with the characters - they were all realistic with their own motivations and problems. I found myself cheering on some characters and scorning others. They all felt like real people. The author also does a good job of introducing a world most Americans like myself never really knew about. I loved reading about the Congo, and I found myself glued to the book as the characters faced real-life problems like illness or lack of food.The reason I rate this book three stars is because of the length. After the climax in the Congo, the book continues on for almost 200 pages detailing exactly how the characters live out the remainder of their lives. I think a simple epilogue would have done it, honestly.Basically, the first, say, 300 pages or so are pretty good, but after that, it just drags."
3,"Interesting, Entertaining Story - Factually Weak","I found The Poisonwood Bible to be an enjoyable, though dark and intense novel. Its portrayal of the Congolese culture was quite interesting. However, factual inaccuracies in the political history of the Congo and the nature of Baptist missionary work in Africa detracted from the overall experience. Although the book is a work of fiction, it is presented in a historical context, and the author should have maintained contextual accuracy."
3,What's all the 'Hoopla' about?,"I heard such great reviews concerning this book that I was rather disappointed when I finally got through it. I found it to be slow moving, dry and too long. The book really did not leave me with anything."
3,"Good book, but a little boring at times.","I just finished reading this book a few weeks ago and thought that it was interesting and educating, but could cause me to become bored more than a few times. It seemed as if nothing was going to come to somewhat of a resolution. It was great in the fact that it really got me fired up because their father was such a nut and that angered me that someone could be that passionate about their work, and create such chaos in the family at the same time. I would recommend it simply because of the knowledge you gain about the situations in Africa in the time of the story. I also like the level of character development. You become one with the girls and their mother."
5,I can't imagine reading a better novel this year,"Luminous prose. Thought-provoking without being preachy. Never loses sight of the forward momentum of its very compelling narrative. Places Kingsolver in the company of Roth, Delillo, McCarthy, hell, maybe even Faulkner...(Acid test: Can she pull it off again?)"
4,we should never forget Her,"I agree with others who feel that it was a tough read at times and there were problems with the dialogue. I must also add that the ultimate outcome of each daughter seemed trite, and almost predictable. Despite these flaws, I had a hard time putting the book down. Something within the writing kept me going back.Having been brought up in a Catholic household, I can certainly relate to the fictional family unit. Certainly not to that extent, but I can very closesly identify with each facet of the family. Kingsolver brilliantly captured the struggle of a woman torn between the relationships with her husband and children. The subtly in which she addresses the mother's ultimate decision to turn her back on her own faith by turning her back on her husband moved me to tears.It is that which made me find this the perfect Mother's Day gift. I have yet to read a more complex, haunting, and moving account of the relationship between a mother and her family."
5,Amazing!,"This ladder, while not cheap, paid for itself the first day I used it. We are doing interior painting and finishing. The ladder is very sturdy, and has deep-enough steps that I can stand comfortably. Not having to move a ladder every 20 minutes is great! And, although the ladder is marked not to stand on the top surface, the top is actually a double wide platform that lets me reach our higher ceilings.Put it in the corner of a room, and be able to reach your armspan along one wall and then three feet plus your armspan on the other wall! What's not to like about that??It does fold, but it still is going to be a challenge to store, since it ends up being 3 feet x 4 feet x 12 inches or so."
4,Misleading advert,"Amazon has added the wrong picture for this product. The picture is of ""TIGI Superstar Queen for a Day"" and in addition, if you search for Queen for a Day this item, the lotion version, comes up. I let them know about this and I see they still have not changed the picture.In saying all that, the lotion is a nice product as well although I returned it this time."
3,IT ARRIVED DAMAGED,"It's a good ladder but it arrived damaged. The ends were bent and broken. I didn't see it at first so I accepted the delivery. But when I first took it out to use later though I saw the damage. By that time it was too late to send it back for a replacement so I'm stuck with it. So, just one recommendation.. examine this ladder very carefully when you receive it and be ready to send it back immediately if you see any damage. Other than the damage, it's a good ladder."
4,America,"In trying to teach a new generation of patriotic citizen Red, White, Blue, and Uncle Who? The Stories Behind Some of America's Patriotic Symbols By Teresa Bateman and illustrated by John O'Brien is the perfect children's book.Here you will learn of the American Flag. The many designs that were considered.The White House, the people's house, how it was once burned. How there are four entrances at the 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue home. The south door is for high government officials and foreign diplomats. The North entrance is for state visitors, family, and friends. The West door is used by the President and his staff and the East door is used by the public.How our national bird could have been a wild Turkey, champion by Benjamin Franklin. The finally chose the bald eagle because it was native to North America.Red, White, Blue, and Uncle Who? By Teresa Bateman is a fun book for all ages to revisit stories of America."
5,Frontier Logs,I bought these for my grandson. My kids also grew up with a similiar product - Lincoln Logs - and loved them. They are well made & sturdy and wlll provide hours of creativity and building fun. He also liked the action figures and the storage box is great for keeping all the pieces together when not being used.
1,Never again,"This book like many others I've tried to learn from comes with useless tutorials because it uses Maya 5.0 which also requires you to obtain a key for it. You cannot get a key so you cannot install it and Maya only lets you download 8.5 now so the plugins you need that the book CD comes with are useless.Its as useless as ""Game Programming All in One third edition"". Never again will I buy any book on programming that was written over a year ago because the software updates so fast that the resources you need that the books come with are always useless."
5,Better than the teacher,"I know this book and its technology are a bit outdated but I'm a student in game art and design and the class I am currently in has us learning Unreal Editor 2 (UT 2004). Although the teacher is very good at this editor, she's not always around and we cover a lot of material in class so remembering everything is difficult. This book is a life saver!! It's actually taught me more out of class than I've learned in class. Everything you need to know about creating games and worlds in the unreal editor 2004 is in here. Textures, static meshes, emmitters, effects, everything. If I had to say one negative thing about it, it would be that in the section where it teaches you how to export/import a 3D mesh into the UT engine, it only instructs you using Maya. I use 3DS Max so it took a bit of research to figure out the max method but it was easy enough to find online. Great book and dirt cheap!!"
2,Shallow Characters,Ann Hood's novel about a pregnant teenager and a mourning widow was full of shallow characters and a jumbled plot. The conversations were simple and provided little insight into what each character was feeling. I forced myself to finish this book and was not surprised when the end was exactly what I had expected.
2,"It was ok, but...","I bought this book with great anticipation, as it had been highly recommended by a friend. I have to say, I was more than a little disappointed. I couldn't bring myself to like Ruby or Olivia, and by the end of the book was hoping that NEITHER of them got to keep the baby. Olivia was shallow, self centered, and only seemed to want the baby to fill the void left by her husband's death. Ruby was rude, obnoxiously naive, and only seemed to want the baby to force her boyfriend to stay with her. If this is a true sampling of Ms. Hood's writing, you can bet I won't be reading anymore!"
4,Lightweigt and good quality,"I'm very happy with this stroller. It's comfortable for the baby, lightweight and easy to use."
3,Not best for a toddler,"I bought this stroller when my child turned 1. It was fine, but I agree with those who complain about the useless canopy. Within 6 months, the seat support has started ripping (my daughter likes to push her feet against the plastic strap footrest, which may have facilitated the rips). I'm going to have to get another umbrella stroller."
5,GREAT STROLLER,"I LOVE THIS STROLLER, IT OFFERS A NICE AND EASY RIDE. THE NET BASKET UNDER IS A PERFECT SIZE. I THINK IT RECLINES ENOUGH FOR YOUR LITTLE ONE TO TAKE A NAP, MY CHILDREN ARE ENJOYING THIS STROLLER.I LOVE HOW LITE WEIGHT IT IS AND HOW EASY IT IS TO FOLD UP. I SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON STOLLERS AND NOW I HAVE FOUND ALL MY NEEDS WITH THIS CAPRI STROLLER. I HAVE A 1 AND 2 YEAR OLD SO I BROUGHT 2 OF THESE STROLLERS ONE IN RED AND THE OTHER IN BLUE. I'M JUST HAPPY AND SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE."
4,"Very Convenient, seats tear","This light weight, compact stroller was exactly what we wanted for our 2 year old after the heavy duty urban stroller (Peg Perego Venezia). The features were great. HOWEVER, two months after the purchase, the seat began to tear through the supports in the front on both sides. I just noticed another reviewer had the same problem. We will have to get another stroller if this cannot be repaired or replaced."
2,Needs an editor,"This was really distracted. She created a really nasty villain, then did virtually nothing with him except something really contrived at the end. There were too many irrelevant characters, she big deal made about rock climbing that didn't pay off - and speaking of that, he never did solve his money problems! The lovers needed to spend more time together to make this work...this was a mess and in desperate need of editing..."
3,Funny Novelty,"I got this from our friends in the UK. We passed it around as a conversation piece with great hilarity. Finally opened it up after 6 months. It is quite good..a little bland..but warm it up in the microwave and it tastes better. Its a mix of crumbly cake and raisins. We don't take it seriously enough for the quaility of the contents only for the funny name.I'd recommend Heinz sticky toffee pudding way over this. when you dump out the sticky toffee pudding on a plate, the sauce covers the top and sides like a creme caramel pudding. Nuke it in the microwave and we put it in the middle of the table and we all dig right in with vanilla ice cream on the side. YUMM-O !"
2,Packaging is not the same as pictured,"I work for Heinz and bought this as a funny item to add to a gift bag for a co-worker; however, the packaging pictured here is not the same as what I received. Pictured here, the name stands out and has a funny impact; the cans I received were slightly re-worded so the phrase ""spotted dick"" was lost in the middle of the phrase ""Taste of Home Delightful Spotted Dick Pudding"" with all words having the same size and style of font. It's almost as if they deliberately wanted to remove the perhaps unintentional shock value the original packaging had. Sadly, that's why I purchased it!"
3,Hate to be in the minority,"...but this book is flawed. While it is a carefully plotted book the characterizations are weak. I don't know why anyone would want this princess; she is almost cartoonish in her attributes and personality traits.Darius isn't much better. I think the ""big"" revelation of why he thinks he's unloveable was pathetic.The dialogue between the two was inconsistent, sometimes very romantic and true and other times forced and trite. It does bother me how this author uses present day slang in her novels. While most probably wouldn't mind, it breaks the believability of the story for me. Ms. Foley does it in all her books.I wasn't bored in this book; I finished it, which I can't say about all her books. In the end, I think I will like this author better when she matures and better understands the dynamics in compelling and believeable relationships."
2,Detached and oversummarized,"Obviously intended to be the central thread of a course involving -huge- amounts of outside reading, if you already know something about the subject, this book will disappoint, and if you don't, it will bewilder (might be useful if you're cramming for a test, but then there's the price to consider). It's an easy read, but it goes by waaay too fast. And, by never losing its scholarly detachment, the book fails to bring the subject people and events to life, betraying in places a mild disdain. Even the included biographical vignettes are overly clinical. History is made by people, who are products of their times. A good historian gives the impression he has walked among his subjects. This book treats them like bugs under glass. For those of us with a serious (but passing) interest in the middle ages, who (let's be honest!) wanted to read two or three books and call it good, this book is a waste of time."
4,Excellent introductory text to the period,"Hollister's history of medieval Europe is accessable, easy to read and abundant with detail. More importantly, it does much to dispel the myth that the ""middle ages"" were a dark period in European history, instead bringing the richness of the time to life. The ninth edition is a further improvement over previous eds, with its emphasis on medieval women.Modern Europe is largly the product of its medieval roots - part Roman, part Germanic, part Early Christian. Hollister's (and Bennett's) masterful treatment of the age (and his ability to demonstrate the relevance of the time) is a rare treat."
5,Hard to put down!,"If you liked the prequel ""Daddy Long Legs"" you will like this one as well. I love books that have letters in them, and this book is entirely letters. It is written well and you still understand what is happening around the world even though you are only seeing what Sallie is telling others."
1,Scary for younger children,"This book is not appropriate for children who are too young to separate fantasy from fact. It contains images of danger and death and the main character, Jemima, is portrayed as inept and stupid. I realize that millions of kids have enjoyed this book over the years, but my child will have to wait until she's old enough to understand these concepts and not be frightened by them."
2,hmmm,"bought it to read to my child. kind of a morbid story for kids, but it was written in what 1908? still, it was free."
2,just buy the CD,"The shooting and action is high quality and typical altman, but you never grab onto the characters. Too much happens too fast, like a great jump blues tune, but as a film it's a bit out of control.The music *is* great, so buy the CD."
1,Someone other than Altman should have cut this film,"There are the makings of a good movie here, but obviously Altman had final cut approval, and his gift was quite off on this one. Belefonte endlessly pontificates nonsensibly, Jason Leigh surpasses her legendary how-annoying-can-she-get Hudsucker Proxy performance, it's long, the jazz performances just make the film drag.Such a shame - beautifully shot, great actors, shame about the director's inability to look in the mirror and notice the obvious bloat. A dreadful, annoying film."
2,Less than expected. I'd hoped for more.,The menu from the Roadkill Cafe was truly clever and humorous. The book wasn't. My expectations were not met as I'd hoped.
1,What a waste of time and money!,"I thought this would be a cute book to give to a friend for the holidays. Good thing I looked through it at the bookstore first, because I'd be embarassed to give it to anyone. Inane ideas, condescending commentary, childlike graphics -- this book is not worth anyone's time, or more importantly, money! Maybe the authors have gone to the Swell ""well"" one time too many."
3,Not their best.,"This isn't the best that the ""Swell"" duo has done. The illustrations aren't very nice-looking, but they were done by a child. It would have been nice if they'd hired a professional to illustrate it for them.I don't know that I'd recommend this book to anyone. There are other books that are worth money more than this one is."
3,Buyer Beware!,"I want to add a word of caution, this is not more of the same from the first CD. If you are expecting a continuation of similar styles from ""Deeper"" you may want to pass.This CD consists of tracks that are what I call Deep House and Trance. It is the type of music that you would find playing at Clubs at the midnight hour. Tracks such as Sunrise by Afterlife and Rapture by iio are the highlights on this CD. The rest is just hard driving trance beatsBeing a huge fan of the first CD Deeper I was so excited when I saw it in the shop. But I was very let down as I listened to the CD. The smooth grooves and melodies which were on Deeper are missing here. 75% of the CD is purely hard driving trance beats.To be perfectly frank if I had known it was going to sound like this I would never have touched it in the first place.Buyer beware! If you are expecting more of 'Deeper' then this is not the album for you!"
1,Don't do this,"I saw the negative advice. But I thought, ""... So some unluckysoul had their ladder delivered damaged. That won't happen to me!""Well, it happened to me. ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!"
4,A review of the first edition,"We checked this out from the library (actually it is an early version called ""Curious George Early Learning Games"") and our 2 1/2 year old daughter loved it. She finds the error signs amusing (eg. a pie in the face). We like it because the voices a re smooth and non-irritative; they are normal speech in appropriate pitch, and therefore easy to understand. Furthermore, the words flow together well, without the typical computer pauses. Best of all, this program has a very nice puzzle game, which plays to one of our daughter's strengths."
4,"""Die Clean....White Doctor From Town""","Wow , what a fun picture . The first time i saw this VERY cleverly made film was at the time of it's theatrical release . At that time , i was way too focused on the prosthetics . I was also 17 years younger . I just finished streaming it a few moments ago . It funny , scary , exciting and fun . Super cast . Loved seeing Steve as the shop owner/phamacist . If you enjoyed DRAG ME TO HELL , or not , you should find much to enjoy here . I'm getting THIS slush puppie come payday . Check it out ."
3,"Corny begining, but it gets better. However not the best Stephen king movie.","Thinner is a okay movie. The only big name actor is Joe Monataga ( Law and Order). He is also the one who gives the best performance, as a mafia like man.The plot about a lawyer, who hits a indian witch doctors,daughter, in a car accident. The courts say it was an accident to. However, the witch doctor curses the lawyer. This makes the 300 lb, lawyer to become extremely thin. So the lawyer must do what ever it takes to get the witch doctor to lift the curse. Sounds good right.And even though the movie starts corny, it gets better.However, the book turn movie fails to live up to other Stephen king classics like, It, Cujo,Misery, and Storm of the century. The acting is also not great.This is not a movie i would buy."
5,thinner,one of stephen kings best. it is a sit on the edge of your seat finish too.if you like stephen king you will love thinner....
4,Bachelor Pad Music,"Wasn't this the music that always started to play when the swingin' bachelor in '60's movies poured a cocktail for some impressionable chick? Getz and crew were all first-rate professionals, and this is as good a performance of this style as you'll find, but unfortunately the whole bossa thing grew quickly and became a mainstay of cocktail jazz groups, then turned into audio wallpaper, at best."
2,Heavy and short life,"I bought one several years ago from Sears. It worked fine first but I think it has 2 problems:1. It adds to much weight to your already rather heavy ladder (mine was a 32ft Fiberglass ladder)2. It was somewhat rusty and stuck when I wanted to use it again after 2 yrs sitting in the garage.3. If you want to take it off you have already ruined your ladder by cutting its legs! so you will be stuck with a heavy stuck leveler ladder!!Good idea, but not so good results so far. I am going to call the manufacturer to see what they suggest."
1,It was a dreadful let down,"I was disappointed with this having two of my favorite movie actors Jimmy Stewart & Maureen O'Hara. It was a horrible let down. This does not fall in to the movies I love. This is not a family or Christian friendly film. It takes the Lords name in vain. Along with drinking, smoking, & adult family problems. What little humor it does have most teens would not understand it and no preteen would understand it. If you are looking for a family movie this is not it."
5,Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation,I bought this for a friend who lives in an Assisted Living Facility. It was packaged perfectly and arrived in perfect condition. She loves the movie.
5,BARNSWALLOW....,"I was so glad this movie was finally released on DVD...One of the best Jimmy Stewart films ever...the comedy is great and there are a few touching moments too that says a lot for this movie...I have seen it many times and plan on seeing it more now that I own it...Boompa , the Turners , the water pump , Brenda , 'Cream Puff' , ""not a light but a dark"" , spatterbox....."
1,dangerous for chinchillas,"First off, this is not big enough for a grown chin to roll in.Also, it has been known to tip over trapping the chinchilla inside. The chinchilla then suffocates to death.It's cute, but a major death trap."
1,I HATE IT I HATE IT SEND UR MONEY 2 ME NOT THE GAME,"OK im sorry guys but this is really really sad...im new to soccer and i got the game from my cousin fifa soccer 2002 so i could see what its all about, it was soo awesome i wanted to buy FIFA SOCCER 2006, I WENT AND BOUGHT AND GUESS WHAT IM SORRY IM DISGUSTED PLEASE DO NOT BUY THE VIDEOGAME, im feeling sorry that i bought it, i had to ask my mom for the money and now i cant even return the game!!!!! DONT BUY IT"
5,Thanks!,This item arrived in a timely fashion. It came exactly as it was described. I appreciate the prompt service very much!
5,Wonderful ladder covers,"We had two ladders that had broken covers on the tops and they scratched whatever we leaned them against!!Imagine how happy I was to find these covers, and evenhappier when they arrived and we put them on our ladders!! Thank you for a great product and we heartily recommend them to anyone who had a problem like we did!!!!"
3,Werner Ladder Covers Only,It would not fit the ladder I ordered it to fit. Would have been much better if it wasadjustable.
4,smells nice.,It smells nice and is good for getting in mood. Also leaves her skin soft and smelling nice.Good 4 a night ofstaying in and getting intimate
2,A Book to Pass Time,"There were some points that Ms. Williamson brought up that I had already discovered in life on my own and there were others that I knew existed but have to accept. Basically, this book is about common sense. I would have enjoyed the book better had it not been for some profanity that could have easily been avoided. This book is not one of my best readings but it is an interesting book to pass time. I would recommend this book to others with reservation."
4,Good book for understanding the woman's perspective!,I read this book and discovered more about the female perspective.This book is for other men who want to understand a woman's spirituality and perspective.
3,Not her best book ...,"Marianne Williamson has written some wonderful stuff ... this isn't her best work. It is okay in the beginning, gets your attention and makes some good points -- but as you progress through the book, you realize she is saying the same thing over and over -- and it gets boring. And it seems so negative. There are some good 'nuggets' here and there throughout that are thought provoking, but by mid-way through I just wanted to put the book down and be done with it. I will wait a bit, then try to give it a re-read to see if I have the same reaction."
1,I wish I didn't look down-at this book,"This book started off poorly with the strange description of what was going on with the movie set. The plot of the book seemed to be contrived, trying way to hard and not always making sense. It read like it was written by two people, not always melding well. It read as though a bunch of situations occuring that didn't always make sense. It would have benefitted if the characters were developed more and the plot simplified to something more basic and believable."
2,Don't Look,"Don't Look Down by Jennifer Crusie and Bob Mayer (audio version read by Patrick G. Lawlor and Ren?e Raudman), is just not a very good book.The main characters, Lucy Armstrong a director of television commercials and Green Beret captain J. T. Wilder are thrown together for a 4 day shoot of a horrible movie which is merely a front for a more sinister plot. The story is uninteresting and the dialogue is not the witty banter I've come to expect from Crusie. There's little suspense and no humor to this book. There is however, a lot of yelling and talk about Wonder Woman.The readers do a decent job and having both a male and female reader makes the reading better... however, it's just not a good book. The best part was the very last scene."
2,Yuck!,"I have read all of Crusie's books and have loved every single one, especially Welcome to Temptation, so I was really looking forward to her new book, Don't Look Down. Unfortunately, I ended up being incredibly disappointed once I read it. This book is completely different from her others--not very interesting or likable characters, the ""romance"" was boring and uneventful, the plot was horrible...just pretty awful overall. It was really difficult to sit and actually finish reading this book. If you like Jennifer Crusie, pass on this book, because you will most-likely be disappointed. Hopefully Crusie's next book will be more like the ones before Don't Look Down, but I think I'll wait to order her next book until after I read some reviews here first, just in case!"
4,Never read Crusie before....,I read the book without expectation and really enjoyed it. Lot's of characters and secrets revealed. Only now do I see what a departure it was for Crusie. I'm definitely on board for the next collaboration!
3,"Not Agnes, but a fun read!","I enjoyed Agnes and the Hitman so much that I went back to read this, it's not Agnes but was enjoyable!"
3,disappointed,I did like the wonder woman references but the story as a hold tried to combine too many elements. I had trouble remembering who the bad guy was and why and what they stealing.
1,"Too complicated and a thoroughly unromantic, unlikeable hero","Promising start, but then it just got way complicated and Wilder turned into a lecherous pig, sleeping with Althea. It just seemed to drag on and on to the point where I was just looking forward to being done. The only character I really liked was Pepper; she was adorable, but she couldn't carry the story on her own. Just not a good read."
5,Great book,"Great book, gave some great ideas for how to calm a fussy baby. Was an eye opener. Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for some suggestions"
3,White Princess Costume,Dress needs to be lined. The fabric is very itchy. The length is extra long. Capelet is a hit with the dress up clothes.
4,Very kind to the hair.,"I have been dying my hair for years now, and the temporaries are the best for me, just giving that extra boost to my already red hair. This activator was very kind to my hair, didn't smell bad, and seemed to deposit the dye evenly through the hair. It mixed easily (you do need to get a bottle or bowl) and didn't burn my scalp. I even had a little tiny cut on my neck from having my hair cut (it's very short in the back and the stylist uses a razor to trim it at the nape of my neck) but the developer didn't even phase the cut.Seems to be a good product when used with the color gems product line."
1,Wrong book,I had ordered this book it is not the book which i have ordered online. i would like to return it.
5,A book of beauty,"The below review says it all realy. James Cowan writes with a real love of the subject and brings to life the emotions, the landscape the events behind the meeting of Rumi and Shems. Unlike others he does not hide the fact that this is a rewrite fo earlier translations and it is perhaps his humility that realy makes this book special.If you want to read the works of Rumi it might be worth starting here (the works of Professor Schimmel will also be of help)"
2,Not A Fan,"I read this as a class assignment a few years ago and it really didn't leave an impression on me. It was difficult to get through; most of the ""action"" being psychological and in form of flashbacks. Overall, I regard it as one of my least favourite reading assignments."
3,Human Behavior Exposed!,"Conrad is a master novelist that concentrates his efforts on the study of human behavior. This book shows how a person can degenerate into a savage. Similar behavior analysis can be found in Lord Jim. Both are excellent works. If you have seen Apocalypse Now, you should read the original story."
3,"the novela is still powerful, but the format detracts","I chose this edition of Heart of Darkness for my Honors Senior English class because of the vocabulary and theme resources promised. While they are helpful, the format of the edition has caused problems, even for me. The volume itself is larger than the average book and each page is equivalent to at least 4 regular pages. The print is so small that it takes great concentration to keep focused. It is a challenge to read Conrad's dense prose in a typical edition, but this version makes it even more difficult."
4,Great exploration of evil,"This book is sometimes hard to get through because the prose is so thick. But I still enjoyed it. Honestly, I would recommend ""Apocalypse Now"" more as it's set in a more recognizable setting, but this book is still an interesting read."
1,DOESN'T LIVE UP TO THE HYPE,"I'm only a high school sophmore so I probably couldn't cathch the sublty of the novel. For me the plot of this novel moved painfully slow. I could only handle two pages at a time before falling asleep. Also the main character, Marlow, evidently has the attention span of a moth because he often goes off on a tanget for as much as two pages at a time. Considering the 70 page length of this book and how often it happens this book is only suggested for those that have insomnia."
1,Awful,English was not Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski's first language. And my does it show! He clearly cannot write decent English prose. This book is meaningless twaddle and is best consigned to the dustbin. Good on those Amazon reviewers who have had the courage to speak out. For those singing its praises I hear whisperings of the Emperor's Clothes.
1,"""The horror, the horror!""","This book is a horrible collection of excess verbiage and meaningless slime I have ever read. The book is extremely suicidial in nature and implies that human nature is purely evil and the best thing that can happen is for us to look over the edge, discover, ""the horror, the horror"" that is life, and die. My, isn't that inspiring and uplifting? The 'depth' of this book is discovered only as one looks for depth in a pond and mistakes the reflection as depth. This book is a thin veneer covering a lack of creativity due to Conrad using up all his good material in earlier writings. This book should not be combined with alcohol or other depressants. Scratch that, this book should not be combined with breathing humans. Let this book lie with its subject, dead. Go read Fahreheit 451 or some other book that actually covers a deeper subject."
4,My opinion,"Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad is just an okay novel to me. It starts off very dry with long descriptive dialect that really put me asleep in the beginning, but later gets very interesting. Heart of Darkness is a story of an outer journey, which reflects an inner spiritual quest of our hero. There is much we don't know about our souls, which is what the story is about. Kurtz was a great man(my favorite character) who was some how corrupted by the power he gained during his trip into the Congo. But following the same river Kurtz took, Marlow is able to trace the experiences Kurtz has and had a completely different result. In other words, Marlow takes the same dangerous route but does not fall prey to the same temptations, which corrupted Kurtz. He managed to withdraw his step from being a savage. I hate how Kurtz dies at the end."
2,High School AP English student.,"I really didn'y like this book. I did understand all of the historical references and the exposure of human nature. Despite all of that interesting stuff, it was boring and a bit slow. No, I am not some stupid child. I am an Advanced Placement student, I am in a very hard English class. I happen to think this is a poor choice for required reading. I don't need to read the book again, I am assured that won't make it any better."
3,Typical Joseph Conrad,"Good short story, but I didn't find it to be great literature. I didn'y feel real involved with the characters.."
3,"Apocalypse after a long time, but not now...","I read this because it was the inspiration for the movie Apocalypse Now which is one of my all time favorite movies, IT is amazing, deep, thought provoking and probably a more honest Vietnam movie, up to a point...The book however I found tedious. I didn't really ""enjoy"" it, I didn't hate it, but I was determined to finish it because that is just how I am. There were enough brief glimpses of where the movie came from even though the time, setting and virtually everything was different. I am unsure as to how exactly the movie came from here, but I am glad it did. This is one case where the movie is way better than the book, in my opinion anyway."
2,Personally couldn't get past the first paragraph,"Not saying it was bad writing. Just not written to grab and keep my attention. I only read maybe 20 pages. I figure if the writing is so dull to start with, whatever great writing in the body of the story is too hidden and not worth the dig to find it. When reading is a slog it ceases to be pleasure. Long ago I determined I didn't have to finish a boring or badly written book just cuz I opened it in the first place."
5,Great stuff,I love reading and I love the classics and I love FREE. Having these as choices for reading is wonderful.
3,Marlow 's discovery of the inner self,"We have the primitive aspect of things before history ,where there is no knowledge , no culture .And this is a kind a journey back to one's heart .Marlow is discovering the state of his begining .Kurtz is a symbol of power & capacity over the natives. women symbolizes wilderness &ivory that charmed Kurtz"
5,Entangling,"Conrad's Heart of Darkness, while being a short book, is certainly energy consuming. Conrad's language emphasizes the tangled masses of the Congo's Jungles and the twisted nature of the characters. As the result of his stylistic devices, which create vivid images, the reader goes away feeling tangled. One looks back and mentally sees nothing but great green masses of tangled vines hanging from trees, and a massive wall of words.One thing that is indisputable is this: Conrad is a brilliant author. Upon examining his other books one realizes that Conrad can actually change his writing style at will. Every single tangled mass of words in the Heart of Darkness is nothing but elaborate emphasis on the plot and the overall imagery."
1,Lost in the darkness,"If you like entertaining stories, you will hate this one. Conrad is continually dark and depressing. In many cases, he makes the story disturbing. The narrator (Marlow) rambles on about his venture into the Congo to unwilling listeners. Conrad uses so much ambiguous language it is almost difficult to grasp the story itself. The wording and language the novella uses, in a way, creates a feeling of confusion for the reader. The number of adjectives thrown into a sentence tends to take the readers attention away from the story. However, the plot is somewhat interesting, if you can get around the style of language used throughout the rest of the story. I am still a bit confused about how this book can be considered a ""classic"" even after reading it. Any underlying meaning or message was lost in the rambling paragraphs of this short novel. In essence, this novella is more for a reader with an acquired taste for 19th century literature."
2,Just dull,"Many people find the writing style of those who are considered ""classic"" writers to be dull. I'm not one of those people and have enjoyed a large number of classics. However, in this case, I did find the book to be boring. The aim was to create a psychological exploration of Kurtz - a man on the ""frontier"" in Africa - an exploration that shows the extremes of horror and despair amongst varying circumstances, and one that unfolds alongside a physical exploration of Africa.This aim was not achieved as I found it just too dreary. It's not that the pacing was slow - plenty of great works have slower pacing. It's that it was slow and the actual writing didn't make up for it. Perhaps Conrad's other stuff is better."
4,Review of the Free Kindle Edition,"I'm not going to review of Conrad's actual work. Too much ink has been spilled on that. I just want to give my thoughts on the free kindle edition.Since it's free, you can't argue with the price. However, you sort of get what you pay for. The chapters are not keyed, making navigation a tad more difficult. This lack is almost a non-issue, however, since the book is so short. The text also contains quite a few typos. Most damaging to the reading experience is the somewhat sloppy paragraphing.These issues are minor, though. Since this edition is free, one shouldn't expect a pristine text."
3,One out of two,The Secret Sharer isn't worth reading. The story starts off talking about the scenery which the author describes for way too long. The story ending does not really end the story. This story is dull and unexciting. Heart of Darkness however; is very well written. It is extremely rich in meaning and has great symbolism. It allows the reader to understand what is taking place more then the first book. The whole story is worth the time.
2,"Less words, get to the point already","I suppose Conrad is trying to paint a vivid picture with using all these fancy words in one sentence, but as for me, I like straightforward simple sentences. The excess use of adjectives detracts from the story, in my opinion, and makes the book less fun to read. Maybe it's cause this book was written 100 years ago."
5,the darkness is in your own heart,"Conrad's novella describes the scenery in more detail than it does the people. In Europe, the people are nothing more than stereotypes, but the closer you get to Kurtz, the more defined, human, flawed and individual they become. Ultimately, Marlow finds Kurtz a broken, dying man. He also finds that that heart of darkness is not in the center of Africa, but in the center of his own soul."
4,Wonderful but short,"Blue sub No.6 is an awsome anime OVA collection. I just wish that it could have been longer. I also wanted to see more character development, mainly the main character and Mutio (wont tell you who Mutio is; you need to see the anime to find out. However all in all the animation, character design, the fight scense, and music ROCK. Just remember this is one of the first animes to incorporate CGI so it is not the best CGI. For me the rest of the anime was really good. Check it out for yourself You wont be dissapointed."
2,Backgammon for Dummies!,"First, the product pictured is not what I ordered or received. Second, the excalibur backgammon I received has ignorant AI. It is predictable and makes the same mistakes all the time."
4,"Pretty good book, but very, well interesting, Read On!","Personally, it was a very good book, one of Benson's best. There was a lot of action, and even when nothing appears to be happening, the book still keeps your attention. However, my only beef with the book is when James Bond has to kill someone that he considered ""family"" at the end. What was up with that? It was almost painful to read about the death of one of the most lovable characters in Bond history. Oh well, other that that it was a great read."
4,American Dream,"According to Webster, this book was the first time the term ""American dream"" was used. At one time the author, Adams, was very popular, seems to have fallen from favor when he took the position that Thomas Jefferson would have been against Roosevelt's New Deal.Seems to me the full flowering in this country of what Adams saw as the American dream is the Colorado caucus-assembly system, which has been under attack in recent years by the power elite. Next April 13th we Colorado citizens will again have a chance to choose our representatives through a system of neighborhood meetings. If we do not exercise this tool for the common person it will be lost forever.Thomas Jefferson said that we would need to have a revolution every 20 years; the Colorado caucus-assembly system provides a mechanism for doing just that without bloodshed. For more information see www.orgsites.com/co/cocaucus."
3,not what i thought it would be,"I had previously bought a flexee in a department store and to date I still wear it . I was sooooooo excited when i saw this but was disappointed when I received the package. The stomach area is not reinforce like th one I had bought in the department store. Therefore, it did not give the flatness like the one i have. For a much skinner person maybe it will work."
2,didn't stop the jiggle,"I used to be a small, but I purchased this thigh slimmer in a medium. It pulled on easily just like reviews said, fits well, nice material, and legs and waist band didn't roll. But it also didn't hold me in like other slimmers I've had before. I still jiggle in all the wrong places (tummy and butt), didn't slim me down much. I think I'm between sizes. Disappointed."
5,Excellent hair gel,I'm always afraid of putting stuff on my hair since I'm paranoid of making it fall off. I feel very comfortable with this product and have not lost any hair since I started using it; maybe bc its alcohol-free.
5,Fantastic Series and ending!,"This is a great series, I highly recommend it for everyone. I really hated for it to end...looking forward to reading her other series!"
1,Unusable w good ear buds since volume control on cord,"Sonic Super Ear Plus (SE7500) - Personal Sound AmplifierI have this same companies PSA 8000 and with the $30 Sennheiser ear buds it is excellent as I say in my review of it. Worse, instead of the $65model they sent me the $80 kit including items that are useless. The sellercharges a 25% restocking fee."
1,Do Not Buy - Fragile Product,"I bought (2) of these wall mounted dispensers and both broke upon installation. The glass dispenser, when you screw it to the base, is very fragile and cracks. Now I am left with the base screwed into my bathroom wall with no dispenser. I am very dissatisfied. Purchase at your own risk!"
5,one of few,"there are not alot of 82mm out there so i was glad to see this one, great filter works good."
3,Gets the job done.,Great filter! I have used this many times for a sunrise time lapse project and it really balanced out the exposure. I kept it attached to my 50mm most of the time and it didn't take long before the glass came loose inside of the ring. I don't think it effects the performance at all but it feels much cheaper when handling when you hear/feel the glass rattling.
5,To the folks who call this an overly condemning account of US attrocities towards the native americans,I have not yet read this book but plan to. I just wish to say that ANY person who knocks this author for giving a damning account of the United States Government. WOULD YOU CALL ANY AUTHOR WHO CONDEMNS NAZI CRIMES AND IDEOLOGY OVERLY CRITICAL?! Numerous scholarly sources maintain that the number of Native Americans killed as a result of colonization and later through displacement and internment EXCEEDS the number of people killed during the Holocaust. So get some perspective here people.
2,A Fine Presentation and Outline,"Unfortunately, any book that seeks to redress ""historical imbalance"" by putting the remaining myths of aboriginal peoples on par with scientific data fails at its assigned task. Unfortunate because this is a well written book that does a very good job of outlining events in the American expansion with reference to Indians."
1,Seller is terrible,"The seller packaged the product poorly and it arrived damaged. He is now saying that in order to get my money back, I need to return the product to him, undamaged. This person is living in a fantasy world and I recommend that no one ever do business with him. He refuses to accept his responsibilty in packaging it badly, even though I sent him photos of how it was as I opened the box. Do not buy anything from this person!"
3,"No single version of ""Slow Ride""?","I can't believe in this age of ""bonus tracks"" this CD doesn't have the really well known single version of ""Slow Ride""! I mean that was their biggest hit but the radio version is very different from the album version. Anyone who bought this for that song will be thoroughly disappointed. The 8 minute plus album version is overblown guitar driven torture."

3,do not let the cover fool you,"first of all this is a low budget movie,and a cross breed between the b/w frankenstein (silent original)and the tv serie ""friends""! a terrrrible blend !a movie for you who like absolutely ...`rubbish movies .if you still buy the dvd,do not forget to put out your cigarret !beacause you are bound to fall asleep. the plot,the acting,the special effects are absolutely 100 % b-movie .ed wood you have a serious competitor !must disturbing is the cuts made to this film,its allready bad as it was.just look at the trailer and see..one cool thing about this film -it`s grizzly green box the dvd is packed in!"
3,Yeah,"I missed the first half hour or so but I caught on, it wasn't too shabby over all, for a slapstick teen flick. But ah, I liked the soundtrack better too, heh. Ok I've been racking my brain to remember the title and artist of the song that played a few times through the movie.. it was a jazzy/blues little number. Help?"
1,Don't waste your money,and time ... Buy the Logitech Z-2300 instead. Sure these speakers look nice and all but when plugged in they sound awful!Honestly I did not expect them to be so bad - I must admit I am an audiophile - but even my wife could state with confidence that these speakers are bad.- Awful sub-woofer - could not even handle metallica - so lets not even go into Karsh Kale and Nitin Sawhney!- Too much treble- had to lower the settings from Media-player equalizer.Got these speakers for 49.99 on a solid deal - but returned them the next day and bought the Logitech Z-2300 - costs about $100 - but WORTH every penny.
5,The Greatest Band in Recent History!,"I recommend this CD for everyone who enjoys true music. The songs contain killer melodies. Recently , the music world has been dominated by Pop (all of those boy bands, Britney Spears etc.). Just as Nirvana ushered in a new era in rock and roll in the early 90s, GMG will lead the way in in shifting the music world back towards rock and roll and away from the tiresome bubble gum Pop. This CD is awesome! Get it as soon as possible and experience incredible guitar riffs, and amazing drums."
1,Cheezemenco!!,"There are many other ""flamenco-lite or nuevo flamenco"" recordings out there that, although not musically challenging, have strong melodies and pretty decent guitar playing. Sorry, this is not one of them..."
2,WASTE,"YA I BOUGHT THIS DVD THINKING ITS WAS GONNA BE TYHE BOMB BUT IT WASENT ALOT OF ACTION,NOPLOT,BUT IF YOURE IN TO 5.1 IT HAS KILLER DIDIGTAL SURROUND SOUND BUT THATS ABOUT IT TO PHONY HAS NO PLOT I THINK IT WAS A JOKE DONT WASTE YOURE MONEY ON THIS ONE"
1,Terrible,"You'll loose at least 10 points off your IQ watching this one. It is definitely *not* a car film; the 3 Oscar winners/nominees ""starring"" in it are absolutely terrible (and wasted) in it. The customized Shelby is ugly - and they wasted 14 classic Mustangs shooting this film (you don't even get to see the great majority of the cars the gang is assigned to steal). This is the kind of sugar-coated action film Nicholas Cage wastes himself on to make a lot of quick bucks at our expense. He can do a lot better. Entertainment Weekly rated it the 5th worst film of 2000!"
3,Guy Movie,"I guess I'd have to say this is a guy movie. Even though I really like Nicolas Cage, even he could not make this movie interesting for me. Based on the previews I really wanted to see this movie ... but I was disappointed when I finally did watch it. There are some good lines in it and Nicolas is good as always and the car chase scenes are fun to watch... but all in all I prefer a movie with more substance. So, my recommendation is to go ahead and see the movie... just don't expect any meat ... just watch it for the cars and the action. (and for Nicolas!)"
4,neat cars-hot women!!!!,"ok, first i wanna say that this is a really good movie, but maybe it is more a movie for the male-viewers. the plot is very simple, but there are a lot of neat cars and sexy women, especially angelina jolie. also the ideas of how they steal the cars and how they prepare themselves is done pretty good. furthermore nicolas cage did again a really good job. anyway this is a decent movie, but if you like fast cars it is defenitely worth watching it."
1,Forgive the pun but 'what a drag' .......,"How can anyone put Nicola Cage, Robert Duvall and Angelie Jolie in one film and make it boring? Well they certainly accoplished that here and I think the writers and the director had to work on it ... real hard ....Most of the people in this movie are not only unlikeable but real stupid too .. and I mean dumb dumb dumb ... Give me a break, steal 50 specific model luxury cars in 4 days (actually like 24 hours) deliver them to the same pier for delivery to that Latin buyer while the car theft divion of LAPD is not only wise to your gig but sets up stake outs.To make matters even stupider than dumb they put the cars into containers right on the dock in from of like 100's of longshoremen ... I mean the cars aren't even featured in this film except as passing references ....This is one dumb dumb dumb flick ...."
2,Only for Classic Cars fans!,"The trailor gives much more credit to the movie than it deserves! And for great actors such as Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie, this movie should have been much better than this!So what makes this movie not as good as it should; 1. Lack of on going action until the last quarter of the movie! 2. Lack of modern expensive fast cars. 3. Lack of cars action except for one classic at the end. 4. The jump of 1967 Shelby GT 500 Mustang was an insult for audience intelligence. 5. Nice story but not well covered!Do not expect too much of this film!"
3,RENTAL PLAYBACK,"We saw this movie a few years ago and knew that we would like it. Our only complaint is in regards to the playback of this particular Amazon rental. It stopped once in the middle of the movie, which was not really a big deal because it resumed within a few seconds, but then, it stopped SIX TIMES within the LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES of the movie. Not too happy about that, as most of the action in this movie takes place at the end. Out of the last six interruptions, we received two error messages, indicating that we needed to choose another movie. Very frustrating!!! Not too pleased with our first rental experience from Amazon."
4,"Too Much Plot, Not Enough Cars","This movie was entertaining when I saw it, and I liked it so that's always a plus. However, for a movie about stealing cars, there wasn't a whole lot of car stealing scenes nor many car chases. The whole point of this movie is sport cars, so shouldn't the director plan the movie around, say, sport cars? There was way too much pointless plot before the all-to-quick car theft. And they made the ending so sad it's tough to watch (you car fans know what I'm talking about).Overall the movie does entertain, but in my opinion, the focus was not in the right area."
4,SIXTY SECONDS into this movie- and you're hooked...,"Nicolas Cage (The Rock, Con Air, Face/Off) reteams with producer Jerry Bruckheimer (The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, Crimson Tide) in a spell binding, explosive, chase-down rush! Nick Cage plays a retired car thief back in business after his young brother is threatened to be killed if Cage doesn't snatch up 50 cars within three days. So Nicolas Cage pulls together his crew of Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider: The Movie, The Bone Collector) and Robert Duvall (The 6th Day) with a few others. This is an awesome action chasedown film- but I was hoping for more explosive, furious gun firing Bruckheimer excitment. But this movie is still a good popcorn flick to catch. 2 hrs, Rated PG-13 for Language and Some Violence."
1,Hunka Junk,"First of all, this is a bad movie. Let's get that out of the way. Another thing, this movie is a remake of another movie that came out in 1974, as opposed to the sixties, as another reviewer has said. A person shouldn't say a movie is ""good"" just because it had cool cars in it. If ""Battlefield Earth"" had cool cars, would the movie be any good? This is just another mindless piece of rubbish from Jerry Bruckhiemer whom has yet to impress me."
2,Not Enough,"If you want to see lots of car chases this is not the movie. The only cars really featured is a Porsche 911, a BMW 540i and the '67 Shelby Mustang. Awfully disappointed. I knew it got bad reviews by the professional critics so I wasn't expecting much in terms of character development. The cars are suppose to be the real stars anyways. But come on! There are only two real chase scenes and its at the beginning and at the end. The Ferrari 355s, Lamborghini Diablos, the 'Cudas, and the Jaguars only make cameo appearances. Its like the actors knew they had to returns them to the rental agency. For a movie that cost millions of dollars to make they could have thrown them in. For me, a real disppointment."
2,"Nonsense Plot, Good Chase","""Gone in 60 Seconds"" is about a race to steal 50 cars in one night. I was hoping for a good plot, but the whole movie is implausible, however, top notch stars give it a small boost of energy. Nicholas Cage plays ""Memphis"" Range who comes out of retirement to save his misguided brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) from being killed by a sociopath black market car dealer. The movie is full of car chases, cat and mouse cops and robbers meet-ups, and lots of excitement as Memphis has to think quick and move fast to save his brother, Kip, and keep his hard-working waitress mother from losing both her sons.Angelina Jolie has a small part as a top-notch mechanic. The great Robert Duvall plays another criminal coming out of a retirement to do one last gig to save a life and keep his friend, Memphis, and family together. If you want a mindless chase movie to eat popcorn at, this is for you."
5,WOW,"First of all what are you thinking if you decided not to go and see this movie, and as for all those other reviews saying it was poor ....well their just plain wrong. Second this film is not a chick flick, it is not a romantic comedy, its good,and with some of the best action and car chases well ever. This film deliveres the good and with extreme speed. Granted it goes a bit slow in the middle when the cars do start to go missing its non stop fun so if you missed your chance to see it on the big screen, Buy it Trust me you WILL NOT regret it."
1,Such a bad influence,I hate how much suspence there was and how loud and suddenthe graphics were.Nick cage was in one of his worst movies yet.(But the family man was pretty terrible too)I wouldnot recomend this movie tp anyone has bad reactionsto loud noises.lololol (Analisa) hahahahahahahaha
2,"Maybe a three star movie, but still...","A waste of great talent is probably the most honest thing I can say about this flick.Jolie is Academy Award material and she hardly does anything in this movie. Gage is a master, this movie was a waste of what he's capable of doing, but I guess he's a good draw. I actually saw this at the theater when it came out and a second time recently. There are cool cars and some cool chase scenes, so it's not that it isn't entertaining, it's just that I was expecting a lot more."
1,PRODUCERS SHOULD BE ASHAMED,"as a lover of action movies, I tend to give them the benefit of the doubt. This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Ms Jolie looks embarassed too - well SHE OUGHT TO BE -THIS MOVIE IS PATHETIC.The basic plot is just senseless - it has virtually no credibilty right from the start - this ex-car thief comes out of retirement, and recruits a small army to steal 50 cars to ""save"" his (lowlife) brother. Would have helped if they kept the brother as a hostage (perhaps right in the car crusher) during the movie, at least it would have had some more credibility.DVD extras are not worth a ""nickel"". Inside joke for those that view the movie -which has all sorts of ""hip"" criminal and prison terms.Movie appears directed at 6 to 12 yr old demographics, and probably has done well with that group. Probably could be developed into a Saturday morning cartoon series of some type"
1,For those who want to see good actors do stupid things.,"Oh, boy, what a lame action flick this is. The story is so bad, involving stealing cars or else some guy's brother is going to get killed, yet you have to wonder why the bad guy decides to let the brother go before all the cars are stolen. Shows the kind of thought that was put into this. Oh, and for anybody who would say that the plot doesn't matter in a movie like this, it's only for action, then the total lack of car chases doesn't help matters, either."
1,The critics are as right as ever.,"Gone in 60 Seconds is without a doubt the worst Bruckheimer action film (Coyote Ugly is probably Bruckheimer's worst overall). The problem with this flick isn't just the fact that it's stupid, but also because it's boring. There's a lack of excitement in the entire movie. It' just not worth watching."
2,"A lot of glam, not much bite","Pretty over-the-top and unbelievable, though I don't think Jerry Bruckheimer was aiming at anything Oscar-worthy (on the screenwriting side, anyway). It's obvious that Angelina Jolie made this before her Oscar win for Girl, Interrupted--her character was rather secondary and pointless. Cage again plays the wise-cracking semi-superhero we've seen before in Con Air, The Rock, etc.Gone in Sixty Seconds probably does appeal to its intended crowd--those who like speed, explosions, and never-ending chase scenes. Those looking for a plot or any characters should not expect much from this. With the exception of a surprisingly good soundtrack, the cars are really the best part of this movie. Worth the rental perhaps, but not the purchase."
5,DVD right on time!,This DVD was a gift for my husband. It arrived in time for the Holidays and he has enjoyed watching it since its arrival.
3,An entertaining wild ride action film.,"The Plot:An former car booster Randall Memphis Raines(Nicolas Cage) thought he left behind his past until his younger brohter(Giovanni Ribisi) got into trouble with an dangerous english mobster(Christopher Eccleston), Memphis is in big trouble, he has to steal 50 exotic cars in 24 houes or his brother will die. Memphis old friends are alos cars booster will help him to save his brother.DVD`s has a fine widescreen(2.35:1) transer and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack. A few good extras but no commentary track from Producer, Actor, Screenwriter or Director and no deleted scenes. An entertaining if silly light action adventure film. Grade:B. Panavision."
3,Good not Great,"I went into this movie with an open mind figuring that it was going be your typical run of the mill action movie. After watching it midway through. I was correct. The cars were great, but the acting and plot were sub par. Also, for Angelina Jolie to grace the cover of the film. She should have been in the movie alot longer than 20 minutes."
2,"ok ,not what i would put in the calabur of a good movie","the plot lame,the characters have nothing special about them,and the only thing this movie has going for it is some nice cars. If your looking for a good movie this isnt what you want but if you want some cheap thrills and nice cars *gone in 60 seconds* is your flick"
4,I have to try not to STEAL any cars.......,Very entertaining. After seeing this film you almost feel like going out and stealing cars. IT's just a really cool movie. There are some stunts in it (especially near the end) that are a little unbelievable but keeping that aside this is a movie that most people will really enjoy.
2,a movie that lived up to its title,"1 star for nic cage-i guess he owed someone a favor.1 star for the beautifull ms jolie-had free time on her hands.i should give the cult 1 star for a pretty good song.the movie itself got what it deserved,1 minute lifespan."
4,It was a fast paced fun film!,"I did like it, some people didn't like it, usually I dont like Nicolas Cage to much but I did like his performance in this film, the cars were hot and the other actors were fun. Last seen was fabulous."
1,Save your money,"OK- Disappointment does not begin to convey the point. Even heavy duty star quality with a supporting cast of fine exotic cars cannot save this movie. The story is grated cheese: a cheesy plot that has been so shred-up for Hollywood consumption that it might as well be baby food. I will not provide an appropriately defaming metaphor for the acting, only out of respect for Cage, Lindo, Jolie, Duvall, and Ribisi. I love action flicks, I love talented actors, I love cars. There was not enough of any of the above to make this movie worth watching. Not even the FX, or the pretty car shots were that notable. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS ONE FOR ANY REASON."
5,The reader-friendliest indroduction to GR,"Most books I read about GR assume that you are some kind of math genius who after a few pages where you are introduced to stuff such as ""vectors as directional derivatives"" etc; you are supposed to be able to master differential geometry, curved spacetime and all the mathematical equipment of GR.James Hartle's book is nothing like that. The reader gets to the physics of GR with math he can actually understand (Newtonian and Lagrangian formalism of Mechanics is enough as a background)and equations he can derive easily for himself. It's amazing that just at the 9th chapter of the overall 24 chapters of the book you can see derived the easiest way the orbits of a particle outside a black hole!In short, Hartle starts where the other books about GR end, that is with the physics. And he ends where the other books begin, that is with the difficult math. This is, in my opinion, what makes this book so interesting and where all his beaty and strength lies in."
3,Pick Yer Path in Life,"Ah, the Paskowitz family! Think ""Into the Wild"" meets ""Beach Blanket."" Surfwise proves there are a LOT of ways to get from Point A to Point B and Dorian Paskowitz chose his own path for himself and his amphibian brood.Not nearly as warm and fuzzy as surf legend Woody Brown, the dogmatic Dorian still exudes a odd charisma that's strangely watchable (sort of in the car wreck way). In the end, the family has similar gripes and similar joys to many families who do follow the middle-of-the-road script of life."
2,Going Hollywood,All in all this was somewhat entertaining in that it shared bits and pieces of hollywood in the 30's. I am not sure what they could have done different. My suggestions is to enjoy the familiar faces but it left me wanting more.
5,Scorsese Presents the Blues,I have been thinking of purchasing this DVD collection since I first watched parts of it on PBS. I'm so happy I finally took the plunge. A fantastic range of musicians are covered and I have a new appreciation of the genre.
5,Love the stories,"This is really a hodpodge of blues. Some fictional stories, some interviews some performances. I like the progression of the old blues to the modern styles. Great singing my Tom Jones, Lulu, Van Morrison and others. Not a tightly cohesive project as I expected. More of different stories told by different people/views. It is not like a Ken Burns type of production. You don't have to watch these in order but I did."
2,Disappointment from Wang & Salmon,"This book was extremely difficult to understand in comparison to some of Salmon's other texts, such as Steel Structures: Design and Behavior. This text lacks a thorough explanation of problems. From a student's perspective or a first time learner's, this is not the best choice. Hibbler has a much better book on Structural Analysis with helpful examples and diagrams. This book expects students to work extremely difficult problems at the end of the chapter without working any examples of similar difficulty. For professors, this book does offer real to life problems that are complex and challenging, but another text may be needed to explain underlying concepts (e.g. influence lines)."
3,"Good Intro, Short On Details","This book tells you what to look out for during examination and diagnosis and how to make use of study casts for treatment planning. I find the chapters on bone grafting to be especially helpful.However, there are 2 problems. As expected in this sunrise industry, the implant systems featured in the book are already quite outdated. I can't imagine myself using an external hex anymore. Restoration nowadays is also a lot less complicated with a wider range of abutments and other accessories.Secondly, the surgical techniques are almost never explained in detail. Perhaps an interactive handson course would be better able to impart that, but if you're a newbie, don't expect to learn much about surgical procedures. A bit disappointing for me when I first bought it, given the size and price of the book."
4,Melodic pop metal,"Me, giving this album 4 stars might has something to do with being nostalgic. The songs on ""The wreck age"" is totally different from the bands two classic albums ""Spellbound"" and ""Crazy nights"", and shows a band that has gone from heavy metal to pop metal. But the songs are very catchy and melodic, and Deverill is a good singer. I guess you'll find this one interesting if you're into bands like DOKKEN. But have in mind that ""The wreck age"" is very time-typical and may not be the best example of music that stand the test of time."
2,"Pretty costumes, but thin plot, fair action","Not having very sharp action scenes for an action movie, and having rather hokey dialogue and plot, all I could really appreciate were the pretty costumes. The movie struck me as a failure. And the cast members have all done much better work elsewhere. Crouching Tiger, Hero, Flying Daggers this is not, not even close. Others seem to rate the movie highly, so maybe I'm not the one to listen to here."
4,Stunning film.,"Opulence and grandeur of Imperial China during the Tang dynasty, 972 ad.Spectacular sets, costumes and a myriad of extras. Superb fight scenes.On the eve of the Chong Yong Festival, golden flowers fill the Imperial palace, when the Emperor Ping (Chow Yun Fat) unexpectly returns his arrival uncovers illicit love affair by the Empress Liang (Gong Li), dangerous alliances, conspiracies; all of which threaten to overthrow his power. However, it may well be the Emperors own dark secret that threatens most.One very dysfunctional family, everyone bar the Emperor ends up dead."
3,bodice ripper,"Pluses: it's a bodice-ripper, it's got great colour, and it's got Chow Yun-Fat chewing the scenery. Minuses: it's not got much of a plot to speak of, and everything is so inevitable. A rental, rather than a purchase, is my recommendation."
3,Jazz with a strange twist,"This is one of those albums in which I would strongly suggest you listen to before buying--especially with a purchase price at almost $50. The best way I can describe this music is of the acid jazz genre. Best for background music while you are doing something else. Not really the kind of music you can just sit down and listen to--unless you are smoking something other than a cigarette. There is no rhyme or reason to the music--it just is and is just there. There is no building cresendo taking you somewhere grand. Some songs just abruptly stop. It's the type of music that if you walked into a lounge, you might appreciate the strong beat while you are enjoying the moment, but will be quickly forgotten as soon as you leave.I gave the album 3 stars because I can appreciate the talent in its production and delivery but ultimately it is not my cup of tea. I guess I am neither hip enough nor high enough to truly enjoy listening to it."
3,Dance Teacher in Elementary School,"I am a dance teacher at an elementary school. I purchased this video tape because I had a substitute coming in during the week of St. Patrick's day. The video was great...for adults. Unfortunately the video goes very fast and I had to come up with an alternative video. However, when I was teaching Irish step dancing, it came in handy as a reference for myself."
1,It's junk food,"Look at the nutritional info, *Its like eating a bag of potato chips and a stick of butter with a little velveeta thrown in for health. I love that it has Yellow #5, Yellow #6 and Red #40 to give it that realistic old fashioned cheese color."
5,"Light, sturdy, and free shipping","I bought this latter recently to access the roof of my one-story house. It's the perfect size for my house. I don't have a truck, and it was very convenient to order this on Amazon with free super-saver shipping and have it delivered to my door. In addition, I'm small and not very strong, but I found this ladder light and easy to -maneuver - or as light and easy to maneuver as a 16 foot ladder can possibly be."
1,Instant??,"been three weeks , the dead parts of the lawn and my shoes are stained green however there has been no ""repair"""
3,a scholar,"This man has had a thorough monastic education (although I think his monastary has officially given him the boot over the practice of a controversial ""dharma protector""). The book was one of the first translations of this text, and comes with a comprehensive commentary. The subject is a work of Nagarjuna, the famous Indian master virtually responsible for what is now known as ""madhyamaka,"" or the middle-way philosophy of Buddhism."
3,The great war series,"I have read through this series begining with How Few Remain. I like the story telling and felt it was well written.,As such have bought the books.I gave it 3 stars though,Some of the story telling went to subjects that were not in the theater of battle.And must point out the caracter in the latest(Breakthroughs)Authur McGregor ,seems to be in east Quebec and south Manitoba otherwise a good story telling."
3,Okay but not indepth regarding F1 technology,"I actually read this book about 3 months ago but forgot to publish a review of it. I bought this book hoping that I'd get some detailed info regarding current F1 cars. Although the book covered many topics relating to the cars, it just didn't have the info I was looking for. I've been looking for something that will provide detailed info regarding the design and function of the various components on a modern F1 car. It's possible that the book I'm looking for hasn't been published yet. At any rate, this wasn't a bad read for an F1 fan."
4,A scholarly work - the split of Judaism and Christianity,"Sigal's doctoral work on the development of Judaism - may help you understand the rift between Judaism and Christianity, I would have given it 5 well earned stars, but the material is dry and difficult, unless you treasure the wealth of references and critical analysis.For Jews, you learn the varied practices and philosophies in early Jewish history.For Christians, the origin of the religion and perhaps great insight into your faith and the relationship to modern Judaism."
3,Please enter a title for your review,most of the time i can't tell whether her anecdotes are supposed to be funny because they're true or funny because they're too ridiculous to be true so i guess they're not a very good example of whichever they are.
4,singing in the rain,"Bot this with much intrepedation, after reading other reviews. Pleased to say it works great. Wished it looked better, and the buttons were better organized. LCD screen is small, for a large radio. But great reception to NPR in NYC and CD works well too. Running on rechargeables for over month, both CD and radio, no problems. Singing in the...."
3,Sea Life Crib Sheet,"Cute as a button, but don't think about putting it over a thicker than average mattress; especially with the ruffle skirt under it."
3,Awful! (Unless you like wrestling with your crib!),"I had to have these sheets to match my daughter's nursery.....they don't hold up in the wash and don't even try to put a mattress cover on the mattress with these sheets, as the sheets will rip in the corner. A better bet (and yes I wish someone would have told me) is the Gerber Knit sheets, they are not only a thousand times softer, but they actually fit with a mattress pad (and who wants to have only one thin layer of cotton between baby and mattress?) The Gerber sheets work much better, hold up longer and actually fit with a mattress pad. These Sea Life sheets are adorable and that is why I am not giving them one star but buyer beware.....they will rip in the corner, I felt like I was trying to wrestle with the crib every time I put one on."
4,"Interesting read, but obviously opinionated","Feffer gives an historical account of Korea and tires to show how much the US played a part in its history. It goes up through the dissolution of the agreed framework and attempts to explain Bush Sr., Clinton and Bush Jr's administration policies. Feffer does a reasonable job but constantly offers very opinionated views against the Bush administration that aren't very well thought out. I found the book interesting and informative and enjoyed reading it but my mind wouldn't allow me to believe everything he said because of the obvious agenda to discredit the current administration. The author does show that the North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il's isn't completely crazy and that there may be a small amount of logic to his leadership. Understanding DPRK's history gave me a more understanding view of their desperate situation of trying to survive in a world that has completely changed since the beginning of their State."
1,All hail the Great Leader!,"This is an excellent book to read -- if you're starting it convinced that the North Korean government is well-meaning and misunderstood, the US is the Great Satan, and you want your ego stroked. If you want an accurate assessment of the facts and not an attempt to whitewash the world's most repressive government, keep looking. Feffer's lack of objectivity is most obvious when discussing what he calls ""mounting evidence"" of US germ warfare against the North during the Korean War. This claim has been so thoroughly debunked with the help of Soviet material released after the end of the Cold War that Feffer's attempt to resurrect it here demonstrates either an incredible lack of thoroughness in his research or, more likely, a deep disingenuousness."
3,Singing Tour,"Looking for a tour of Disneyland with sing along songs? Then look no further. Nothing particularly new here, just new versions of classic and theme park Disney songs. Lots of fun for kids. It is briefly introduced by Mr Owl before getting on with the fun, and you will have fun- it'll really get you in the mood for your next trip to Disneyland California."
2,Ad for Disneyland,"If you want a travel & tourism advertisement for Disneyland, this is for you. You can see the rides (from more than a decade ago), the merchandise from the gift shops, the food available, etc. If you want songs that your toddler can actually sing along with, go with another show (my just-turned-3-year-old could sing most of the songs from the Campout sing along within a couple of days; he sings one or two from this one). It just depends on what you're looking for..."
5,A lovely DVD. Don't forget to watch the French Version on the same DVD. It is different and is lovely. Kids love it too!,"My daughter is 3.5 years old, and she loves this DVD. Somehow, we discovered that you can play it in English or French. We played the French version one day and she loved it (eventhough she doesn't know any French words except Bonjour!). The French version is done at Euro Disney so the scenes are very different and are lovely. She loves the English one and the French one equally....so it is like having two DVDs!I have to say that there is one song in the haunted mansion that is a bit scary but she doesn't mind it at all. This song is on both versions but is slightly different. But Donald duck is funny in that song since he is pretending to be a ghost so he makes her laugh, and she doesn't think it is scary."
1,NOT A NULL MODEM,"The item I received was marked as a Null Modem, However the item I received was a simple male to female adapter."
5,Mulgrew rocks,"Gave as a gift and the recipient loves it. We've been lucky enough to see Mulgrew Miller in person several times; he is the consummate professional and even if you're not a fan of jazz, you'll enjoy listening to him."
2,Wonderful Poetry; Execrable Translations,"One just doesn't get the chance to use a dandy word like ""execrable"" that often, but there's no better word for Ben Belitt's translations. 'nuff said.On the other hand, the poems themselves are magnificent. If you have enough Spanish to catch their rhythms you can appreciate them without letting the ghastly translations spoil your enjoyment."
2,Great Poetry Poor Translation,"As someone who speaks several languages I understand the difficulty of translation. However, the degree to which the tone and voice of the poetry changes in this translation is alarming. If you speak spanish, I highly recommend this book. It is a very complete (relatively speaking) collection of Neruda's work. I read it and use it all the time. However, if you only speak English I warn that you won't really be experiencing the poetry of Neruda if you read this translation."
1,Get a different anthology,"I could not imagine at first how anything by Neruda could rate lower than four stars, so I browsed some of the translated poems in this book and compared them with other translations. Most of the other reviewers are right. The English versions are unbelievably bad, and that's quite a feat because Neruda's verse is generally economical and unpretentious. I suspect that Babelfish could have done more justice to Neruda on some of these poems.A good alternative to this would be ""The Essential Neruda: Selected Poems."" It's a well-rated collection produced by a team of strong translators."
3,Not The Best,But not bad. I preferSing Along Songs: Disneyland Fun (Volume 7)andDisney's Sing-Along Songs - Happy Haunting. This one was just not as enjoyable. The songs were not as fun. There was more kids and less characters. It was just less all around.
2,"The songs are nice, but ...",I do resent buying a commercial Everytime my daughter sees it the nagging for a trip starts. I have learned to dread the sight of the video.
5,A fine pianist and very strange singer,"What can I say?This compillation was basically my introduction to Blossom Dearie (except for a very fine song I've heard her do with King Pleasure)...Her piano playing is very strong, her accompanient also (Ray Brown, Jo Jones, Ed Thigpen...), but that strange, childish voice... It's an acquired taste, I have to admit it, and I haven't acquired it yet... But I'm getting there!Every time I listen to this fine Verve compillation I hear more and more depth in singing that at first glance sounds anything BUT deep. There's a lot of irony, innuendo that might even border on kinky?I'm not sure. But I'm intrigued... And I'll keep listening."
5,This CD is so beautiful!!,I was introduced to Blossom Dearie with this CD and I'm completely hooked! Her voice is so clear and light. I love this CD.
1,W2508,Help - my rivetted mechanism has also broken on model W2508 and I don't know what to do - it's a real bummer - I can't see why I would need to buy a new attic stairway - can't I buy a new bracket and drill it into my existing frame.
5,Creating a foundation of strong marriage with the foundation of the family - wife and mother!!,"I got this book over year ago and never could get myself to read it -- finally last month I picked up, in hopes of adding spark to the marriage. I am on the last few pages and now I am looking into doing a women's bible study with this book!Great book - Easy to read - short chapters - great issues to talk about - made me rethink my ways and has helped me greatly on which way my thoughts go and how to stop the thoughts that are wrong to be thinking.I am not sure if it is me or the book -- but the end does not seem to have as much power and strength -- appearing to be weaker in the thoughts and answers. -- however like i said it could be just me...Overall this book has been great and some nights i could not put it down!! A MUST READ!!"
5,Great CD by Christy Moore,Great CD by great artist. Everything Christy Moore does is great. This is no exception. Keep it up. He signs many original songs.
1,Eep.,"This is the only book I've ever hurled against a wall. (And it felt so good, I did it again.)I know some people enjoyed this book, but I found the writing cumbersome (the first line is something like ""Balzor was proud"") and extremely preachy and judgmental. Would-be readers ought to be warned that halfway through the book, the author writes the characters into a corner and stops the book, then starts it over with a different set of conditions (""This is what would have happened if someone had witnessed to this family fifteen years earlier..."") I felt that was an authorial cop-out."
5,What a Woman,"Diane Snyder-Haug is a one-of-a-kind author, with an eye for style as well as a brain for history. . .This book should be mandatory for all students in design and fashion. . .Wish she were an instructor at MY school. Does she have an e-mail address?"
5,A blues-Jazz master!,"This is a sad work! The combination of the great harmonica performance of Cotton's deep blues style,with the jazzist style of the two other men,Haden on bass and Joe Louis on guitar,only could result on this really sad work! But this work must be understood as a conceptual downhome blues,and the sad sensation that seems to be at all the tracks reveals how hardly were that days of slavers and workers at cotton picks along the Mississipi River borders!This is an excelent way to feel that sentiments,only a giant like James Cotton could bring to us! Really a gem,a masterpiece of this old bluesman! Thank you James for this class of blues and it's roots!"
4,Get in shape fast!,Great work out video that targets specific areas. Easy to follow for even the beginner with great results. Tones and strengthens buns and thighs as well as giving an aroebic workout. Started to see results after just a couple of weeks.
3,Interesting Snapshot,"This book provides a good discussion of digital copyright issues that were fresh (some would say raw) back in 2001 when the book was published. About half of the essays focus on the Digital Millienium Copyright Act, and that law's anti-technology circumvention measures. I'd like to see something new from the authors on the subject, although in the digital age a blog would be more useful and current than a book."
5,Best I have seen,"After having been disappointed by all of the Oracle Press books, I am delighted to finally find a tuning book that makes sense. The scripts in this book saved me humdreds of hours of coding, and Burleson is great at explaining complex principles. I have bought them all, and this is the only one I reference."
1,Very Misleading!,"I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who gives this movie only 1 star. It was such a letdown. I do not see what all the hoopla was about this movie. It is boring and misleading. A young boy is killed by a car. Naturally, the parents are devistated. They try a new stem cell procedure to have their son cloned. They try this procedure and impregnate the mother with the new ""clone"". She gives birth to a boy who looks identical to the one they lost. At first everything is going good until the boy starts acting strangely. There are no big suspense scenes at all and again, this movie is rather boring. I'm glad I only watched it on t.v. and didn't waste my money renting it. Not worth it!"
2,"Close, but no cigar..","A great cast does well in one of the most disastrous movies of 2004. Okay let me start by saying the DVD features a total of 5 different endings. The 1 that was chosen and 4 alternate ones. What does that tell you? It tells me that the director was at a loss with his movie. He is forced to cut his movie over and over trying to bring it together and realizing that an interesting idea isn't enough. I'm not suprised that there are so many alternate endings. The entire movie is very cut up, it's like maybe there's a better movie somewhere amongst everything that was filmed. ""Godsend"" is like a bad remix to a good song. I really dislike this feeling of lost opportunity. The 2 stars is for the cast who probably cried when they saw the final cut. Greg Kinnear, Robert DeNiro, Rebecca Romijn Stamos, and young Cameron Bright all deserved a better movie."
1,UTTER GARBAGE,"Although moves way too fast in the beginning, GODSEND seems interesting in the beginning. However, it quickly goes pear-shaped and becomes too far-fetched for its own good. Totally ridiculous without any real explanation for things that occur.What a shame De Niro and even Kinnear would want to be part of such a poor film. Money talks, I guess. Reputation comes second?Not worth seeing at all. Garbage all over."
3,The Boy is 1/2 DeNiro's son and 1/2 the Couples.,That is why he is acting so weird and vicious in the first 3/4 of the movie.
2,lame,The film has a good plot. The previews seemed kind of scary. When you see it you will be dissapointed. It delivers very few shocks. Robert Deniro is a great actor but when you have to work with a script like this there is no way he can show his true talent. The acting is not too spectacular either. You would have thought the filmakers were going to go into a Omen type feel to it. Instead it has a lame idea of why the clone is wrong. The movie could have been great but it went into a wrong direction. The movie also has a sorry excuse for an ending.
3,boring land scary movie,"Though it is good to see good ol' Talk Soup's Greg K. getting movie roles, I would have to say this one of De Niro's worst films. All in all, your basic blah movie. A rehashing of the ""scary child"" theme that has been done before and better."
1,A film with 4 alternate endings that all stink right along with the rest of the film!,"Poor Greg Kinnear and Robert DeNiro! They wanted to work with Rebecca Romijn and this is what they got....GODSEND...or is it GODS END? What is was is perfectly awful.Paul and Jessie lose heir beloved son,Adam in a freak accident.They are approached immediately by a cloning scientist who promises an exact replica of their son.Well, they don't get it and neither will you.This is one big turkey!"
5,Celtic Frost Fan Forever,"I've been a Celtic Frost fan ever since I heard the 'Morbid Tales' and I've been through all of their CD's and I compliment them on the subtle changes in their style of music, and I really think that it is best shown on this particular CD. Now this CD is not what I would consider a BEST OF but it does have some of their more popular songs like 'Circle Of Tyrants' and 'Return To The Eve' to name a few, but what I really enjoyed was the jam sessions and the songs that were cut from the CD's that they had released. I own ever Celtic Frost CD that they have released and I constantly listen to them. I love Thomas G Warrior's voice and I love the music that Celtic Frost creates."
1,Style over substance,"I tried reading this cover to cover and, as another reviewer noted, this ""Socratic"" style of the author in a conversation with a beginning writer is irritating and self-consciously unfunny. However it DOES unintentionally provide an example of what NOT to do in dialogue: draw it out endlessly, in a circle going nowhere. If brevity is the soul of wit, this book has neither brevity nor wit. Just about any other book on dialogue--or even a book with just a solid chapter on dialogue--would be a better investment."
3,Simple & General Introduction,"When I read about the book before I bought it, I got the impression that it will talk in details about .NET applications and the way they interact with .dll files they link to. I was interested maily in product installation issues and deployment. I bought the book and read the chapters that I saw peratining to the subject. The discussion related to the issues I was looking for was not that deep or detailed to clearly explain deployment/setup issues that I am facing at my work. The book did, though, add to my knowledge about the way the .NET CLR works, memory management, ... etc., but very little about setup and deployment of .NET applications."
1,wild star,"After reading Midsummer Magic, I frantically looked for other books by Ms Coulter.(Midsummer Magic is one of the BEST books Ive ever read!!!) HOWEVER.....this story i couldnt even finish......no story whatsover and just endless sex scenes.I waited for it to go somewhere but it just never did. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED."
5,Ripley's Game,"Just continuing my exploration of The Ripliad. Will be finishing this one soon, then moving on to the other two remaining books.Love Patricia Highsmith - also can't wait to read the Beastly Horror book and Little Tales of Misogyny. She was an amazing author.This item arrived promptly and in great shape, despite having been to 2 correctional facilities! I was fascinated by this!!! Awesome, and I plan to continue to shop from this seller.Thanks very much, A+++ and highly recommended. (the book and the seller.)"
1,Product discrepancy,"I purchased these for my mom. She was intending to order socks that had a closed toe. Because she had no idea what ""inspection toe"" meant in the description, and one of the images showed a sock which does have a closed toe, she assumed it was the right product and I ordered it for her. When they arrived with a toe opening, I contacted the seller to return them. Not only do I have to pay for shipping but I also incur a 20 percent restocking fee! Essentially, I am only getting half of a refund all because the item description is not very clear. I noticed a few other reviews that say they had the same problem."
1,return your zantrex!,"I bought the product at GNC. They explained it was one of the most popular weight loss products they have...and guaranteed that it worked! After a week, I gained weight! My stomach and waistline had ballooned. I think I experienced water weight gain from taking the pill and even my face got fat! I stopped taking it and just decided to diet/excercise. 565% weight loss? not for me...and you should return your bottle too."
1,Far from the original recipe,This did not work nor did it give me any energy. All it did was keep me up. My eyes were weary and my body was tired but I just couldnt fall asleep. Didnt have much energy to do anything else. This is nothing like the Zantrex 3 I tried years ago.
2,Strange Reaction,"I have taken quite a few different types of fat burners and have NEVER had the bad reaction this stuff gave me. When I would take it, yes, it did all the stuff it said (weight loss I dont know, but I wasnt hungry, had more energy, etc.) But my face and neck and hands would turn blotchy red and start burning and itching. When the effects of the pills wore off my skin would go back to normal. As horrible as this sounds I thought it was just something my body had to get used to so I continued taking it and it continued to have these crazy effects. WOULD NOT USE AGAIN."
4,High Energy!!!,"I am a healthy 34 yr old female and I've been taking it for a week now. I have never had so much sustained energy . That's what Zantrex3 does. It's not a miracle pill, it doesn't melt fat, it gives you the energy to do what's necessary to burn the calories quicker than if you had little or no energy. It's not for everyone, but for those who do not suffer side effects, its a great energy boost. The first night I had trouble sleeping, but after that, I worked out so hard at the gym, I had no choice but to fall into bed tired at the end of the day and sleep like a baby.I'm very happy with the weight lost results in the first week; 3 lbs. I was at a plateau with my exercise program/weight loss for three weeks, this was the breaker. I'm very happy with the decision to use this product."
2,A book only an Academic would love - very hard to read.,"The author does cover many of the key issues. But a ""real world"" leader or manager will find it very difficult to glean useful information out of this book written like a academic research paper."
1,Not the item pictured!,"The picture shown for this product is anOmega 18202 Air-Actuated Bottle Jack -20 Ton. This is not the product that you are purchasing. The product that will be shipped is more likeHeavy-Duty 20 Ton Air - Manual Hydraulic Jack - 20"" Lift Height. I ended up returning the product that was shipped since it was not the same quality as the product picture."
2,Poor reliability,"The system worked well for about a year but then developed an annoying noise from the cooling fan in the amplifier unit, similar to what other reviewers have described. The noise became progressively worse until the entire amp failed several months later. Of course, it's a fully integrated system, so nothing can be repaired or salvaged."
5,Creatively Comprehensive,Offers strategies for CREATIVE WATERCOLOR and ALL MEDIA. THe creative process and how to use it. Brand new copies available!email battartist@aol.com...45.00
5,Sunlight on his fingertips,"Sunlight on his fingertipsThe very bright talent of Michele Legrand you can feel especially when Maestro is playing piano himself.I heard some orchestra performance of Legrand before, that was good, but I was still thinking about him just like about pop music composer.Now I think different - he is Genius!"
3,A Look Back in Time,"I liked Frances Parkinson Keyes writing when I was a teenager in the 60's and remember reading everything the local library had. I thought this read was interesting from a historical perspective to see where we've come from in regards to America and its sexual mores; the writer, who was a Senator's wife writing in the 1940's primarily, had a virginal outlook on sex. The writer is very moralistic. This is a love story. The main character in this book we would today call a real ice cube. The central male character would move on."
2,I'd like to review but....,"It would be nice if I could find 2.6 oz canned chafing fuel to use with item. I'd like to test it out, but have searched high and low for the fuel!!! Can anyone help?"
2,Details galore,Conrad's book has a very good idea and I respect that. However throughout the book Conrad insists on describing things with twenty adjectives or more. His descriptive nature turns readers off and for any college student as I am I would rather spend my time numbing my brain with chemicals. However the book is a thriller and it is a book with many issues that are prevalent in today's corrupt society.
5,One of the best books of the 20th century,"Rarely does a book build on itself as well as Secret Agent. The book starts modestly, but builds in structure, language and plot to a dramatic and heart rending climax. A gem."
4,Good (depending on your needs),"A strong set by Bird & Diz, but the real reason to buy this CD (versus better ones by either of these artists) is that Buddy Rich is the featured drummer. It's nice to hear Buddy hang back for a change, although his occasional solo breaks are the usual blistering affair. Not for the manic depressive."
1,Probably dangerous,"Sounded great, half price for a stronger battery- and I wanted one for those long days away from a charger. But, this one is decidedly subpar. Alas."
1,Boring....,"This movie had potential, but it was so boring. Debbie is beautiful, as always, in it.Love Debbie Reynolds, but I didn't like this movie."
5,Great ladder for any job.,"This is a great ladder to have, Had one before but was borrewed and never return. A little costly compared to the department store ladders, but you will not find this type in your Home Depot's of Lowes store ether. Use my ladder for all types of jobs around the home that I need that extra 4 to 5 foot hight, both inside and outside."
2,could have been better,"This film needed a more introspective approach to really work. The music and pacing were weak. The boyfriends, with the exception of John Heard, were insipid and fairly revolting. Sean Young, who can be fine, was under directed here."
2,TOO COMPLICATED,Ingredients for the receipes in this book are not readyly available. Only avail at healthfood stores - a bit costly. I DO cook for my animals and found this book difficult to work with.
1,Not worth the bother,This book is a waste of time and money. For starters - it just uses the bread machine as a mixer - it is not anywhere near as easy as using your bread machine to make bread. So the title can be misleading. And as another reviewer said - it isn't for dogs with allergies. That was the whole point of me baking my own - to provide my dog with treats that he can't have otherwise because of his allergies. And the book is just too scatchy on the details. It doesn't tell you for each recipe how dark the treats should be when done - so you don't know if they are raw or burnt. I will return to the internet to search for some recipes for my dog that he can have despite the allergies and which I can make without guesswork.
3,Special Features are cool! No music videos sucks!,"The collectors case is cool as well as the special features. The episodes are short ,chopped up and censored. They are a little better then the dvds Time Life made but still a fail with no music vidoes. Shame on you mike judge. you cant cut the videos out. They are what made beavis and butthead what they are"
2,Coming apart after9 months,"This laptop case is big enough for my computer and projector but after only 9 months it looks atrocious. The handles are coming apart and the slightest abrasion and it gets all ""furry"" with threads. Cheaply made and I paid way too much for it."
5,TTL500 - Corrects Error in Posted Review,"Review posted from P. F. is for a TTL300 case which does not have the expanded compartments the TTL500 does. Previous review is on the money for the small case. The TTL500 has all those features and a significant added pocket that can carry a portable printer, a work binder, or a thin projector. The TTl500 also has an expanding portfolio file section for letter sized folders. Nice package and storage for 4 lbs. Well constructed."
5,Great Accessory,This is a great adapter for video when using an apple computer. Works well with video applications.
3,Shipped on time,"This came in as promised but I haven't been able to get it to work as I want, But this is I think due to the other cable. I wanted to go from my MacBook Alu to video and tried using 2 cables to do this. It didn't work."
5,The Cat,"Natalie Holland has always been a bit too curious for her own good. She knows she should just mind her own business, but she can't resist the unknown. When Natalie and her little sister, Carey stop at a strange booth at the local crafts fair, Natalie is instantly drawn to both Shadow, a sinister looking cat and the carved wooden cat behind it says, BEWARE DO NOT TOUCH. Curious Natalie can't resist. But the minute she picks up the carved cat, she sets off a chain of events that ends when Shadow races off his perch...and straight into a speeding carShadow's ,ysterious owner, Wanda vows Natalie will pay for her curiosity. Shadow is waiting to return from the dead-and Natalie is going to help him. Unfortunately, she only has ONE life to give..."
3,Marikaye,Loved the first book but this one had long sections that were boring then at the end there is no real explanation as to why the Assyrians just pick up and leave. The BIble indicates that God goes into the enemy canes and kills a large majority but the author doesn't explain anything about this. I like the love stories unrestrained in the book but the true history is being ignored.
4,Good book but lots of difficult terminolgy,"This book was used in class for Law and Criminal Procedure. The textbook read great however, the supreme court rulings were difficult to follow. At times I thought I thought I was reading one legal outcome only to find out that I had the wrong interpretation of the law as described. I think it would help to do a little Legal terminology 101 just for review by yourself. Without it, certain aspects of the what the author is trying to convey may get lost in the terminology and legal jargon."
1,I'd give it a 0 if possible,"I waited so long to read this book, and hated it after the first page. It's more of a pretentious glorification of herself than a biography."
3,Interesting but...,"I read this book and found that it was very interesting. I learned some things and the book was very good at dispeling some of the myth of geisha. However, I found that it was not written very well. Somehow the tone did not seem genuine but this may be a problem of the English translation rather than from the author herself. I also did not think that the book went into the level of detail that I was expecting, especially since this was a book written by a former great Geisha.All in all, I was somewhat disappointed."
1,Poorly written,"I read this book a few months ago and was very disappointed. I had read ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" several years ago, while living in Japan and really enjoyed it - I thought this book might be similar. Not only is it very poorly written, the author comes across as arrogant and ignorant at the same time. Arrogance isn't a compelling characteristic in any culture, but it's particularly undesirable in Japanese culture. I kept reading though, expecting the book to get better - it didn't."
5,The next cult classic. Move over Spinal Tap!,"An outrageously humorous film that breaks new grounds in cinema. Also, an excellent date movie for breaking the ice, if you dare!"
4,What happens after mastery? Now we know!,"It is uncommon to meet a true martial arts master, and even more uncommon to meet a Zen master. To encounter someone who is arguably qualified to be both is truly to be in rarefied company. To ask a rhetorical question, if Kensho Furuya is not such a master, then who is? If one takes seriously the ideas in this book, then it might change your life. For martial artists in training and for aspirants to the Zen mind, KODO is a blessing twice received. I, too, am grateful for it."
2,"just buy ""SS Girls""","Just but ""SS Girls"". It is awesome. A B movie classic. The others are ""B"" movies, meaning boring."
4,Real life in Toyota,"The book accounts for the actual life of the Lexus Brand and Lexus projects, since the beginning with the strong leadership of one of the best Toyota Chief Engineer to the up and downs in the market. If you are a Toyota fan you will discover that also Toyota can fail; the difference is in how Toyota learn by its own failures and comes back."
4,Lexus story,Only really of interest if you want to understand how japan thought through the process. It certainly an interesting road to travel
2,Company Manual,Was a stinker from the start. Seemed like the author was hoping Lexus would pick this up and make it mandatory reading for all employees. Boring as heck and probably the worst of many books about the auto industry that I have read.
3,GREAT LITTLE STARTER CD...............................,"If you are interested in hearing 'some songs of some groups' from the very early British scene,""MERSEY BEAT"" will give you a pleasant introduction to various groups of the day.This isn't a compilation of number one hits one after another, rather, it's a cd that reminds you what the groups sounded like, and then you can go from there, buying fuller versions.If you can get it used and clean, the feather is in your cap."
5,This album is truly enjoyable,"This album represents one of the last of the Hollywood musicals.It is a very enjoyable soundtrack with the beautiful music of George Gershwin,the dancing of Fred Astaire,and the stunning presence of Audrey Hepburn. There are some very interesting songs that this album has;one of them,'How long has this been going on' is sung none other than Audrey herself,and she does an admiringly good job singing it.There is another song that Audrey and Kay Thompson sing-'On how to be lovely'-this song sounds fantastic. Beautiful music,beautiful dancing, and beautiful actors-what a perfect combination!I highly recommend this movie,and I'm sure you'll agree,you'll like it as much as I do."
2,Not for Werner Ladder,I bought this as a bundle with a Werner ladder. The Werner ladder has the extension on top. So that reduces the standoff to 6 inches. But the worst part is the lower bracket jams against the highest rung of the lower extension and was very hard to un-jam. This jammed so hard it bent the lower bracket. I'm going to return it.I do not recommend this product with this type of ladder.
4,Ladder stabilizer,"A fine product, well constructed, meets the manufacturer's description and works as it was intended to.The only suggestion I have to improve its usefulness is to provide two hangers instead of one. While painting, for instance, you could swap your pail to the other side while up on the ladder. It also could be advantageous to have two hangers and have a tool or tools on one side and paint or other necessities on the opposite side of the stabilizer. At present, the stabilizer must be partially disassembled on the ground to swap the hanger from one side to the other.Pop"
2,Cabbage Head,"Cabbage head because by the time one inserts credit cards, cash, etc. etc. the wallet becomes the size of a cabbage head. Not exactly ""slim"" as advertised. I couldn't stand it, so the wallet was retired in favor of a bifold. This was purely a personal choice and had nothing to do with the craftsmanship of this Hilfiger product. Maybe I can get my wife to use it...."
3,"This is an old, outdated edition","FYI, this is an older edition. I accidentally bought it because the date seemed very recent. I believe it's 1995 and the second edition is 1996. The newer edition has a lot of improvements so this edition is probably not worth buying, especially if you're using it for a college class because they will almost certainly be using the 2nd ed."
2,Poor Zipper Placement,"This product is well constructed, however, I am not impressed with the zipper location. In order for me to open the compartment, I have to loosen the straps on the side because the zipper is pressed against the underside of the seat when the straps are tight."
5,Topeak Aero Wedge Seat Pack,"This is an excellent biking pack. It holds just enough gear to get you out of a fix if a tire goes and/or you prefer to use it for keys, cell phone, snack... I'm very glad I made this choice. This is one very strong seat pack.I'm with M. Martin. This bike pack holds just what he said it would hold!!!A REAL BARGAIN. JUST WHAT YOU WILL NEED!"
5,A big medium bag,"I got the medium bag, and it is a big medium. And that's without expanding it. I can easly fit a spare tube, patch kit, large multi-tool, tire levers, old sock for emergency chain handling, and still have some room left over for keys and snacks. I really like the way it hugs the contour of the seat post and seat. The strap system snugs it up nicely so it's not bouncing or swaying around when I'm out of the saddle. Typical Topeak high quality construction."
3,"Good but not excellent, expected more","Good quality, but there are a few issues with the bag.It is difficult to unzip when the bag is mounted on the bike as the saddle blocks your hand when the zip reaches the top.Lightly touches the back of the thigh when cycling and it is kinda irritating.Does not hold my wallet after putting in a spare tube.If you are very concerned with the angle of your tail light then please be reminded that the product does not allow you to adjust the angle of your tail light. That angle may change when the shape of the bag changes due to the things that are put inside."
2,Too small,"Far too small for just the essentials so unfortunately I am returning this item. Tried fitting cell phone, keys & bike tools but the fit was too tight. Nice pocket for money/license but overall does not fit my needs. Alas, I will do some leg/field work to check sizes before re-ordering."
4,Perfect bolt on replacement gear reduction !,"This was a perfect buy for me. I was having a heat soak problem with the factory (32 year old!!) starter on my truck and was ready for not only a new one, but for a gear reduction upgrade. I've had it on my truck for a number of months now and can only say good things about it. Easy as can be direct bolt on with no modifications, strong fast starting and no heat problems in the 100+ degrees I have been using it it. the only reason I didn't give it a full 5 star rating is that it is not American made."
4,Great,"I have used this product in the past, and I wanted some back-ups for the future. It offers everything I need for my exercise."
2,CD Quality issue,"Looking at the tracklist of this CD it looks very promising to Jan Akkerman fans. Furthermore it is a live performance which - often - brings out the best in the artist. After this CD - Wounded Bird label - arrived at my doorstep, I put it in the CD player with high hopes. However disaster struck, the sound quality of this particular CD is poor (understatement). The poor sound quality does not do justice to the musician in any way or form."
4,Ease of Use,I really like the rapid relief. This is much easier to wipe off then the desitin maximum strength which I have used in the past. I just wish these products were all natural. I happen to be using a small tube of Dr. Sears Diaper Rash Cream which is all natural and I love it!
5,A star among zinc oxide diaper creams,"For our baby, this has worked much better than other well-rated zinc oxide creams (specifically, Mustela Vitamin Barrier and Triple Paste Medicated) to the extent that diaper rashes of any significance have become a thing of the past. The 16 oz. tub is convenient for use beside the changing table and lasts for several months."
3,Desitin for Prevention,I only use this product for prevention. Since my 8 month old is drinking juice he pees a lot more. So I use it only before bed. It's cheap so I use a lot mixed with vasaline. Super protection for night time. I love it the max strength has way too much zinc for overnight use in my opinion. Probably suppose to use max if the baby has an active rash. But I opt for another cream for that purpose. But overall it's an okay product for prevention purposes. Also when u use it at night by morning it's not hard to wipe off. Happy bottoms make happy babies!!!!
1,"Qty of 1, not 2!","The description says ""Desitin Rapid Relief Creamy Ointment, 4-Ounce Tube, (Pack of 2)"" and there is an icon/image that says '2 pack' by the picture, however I received only 1 tube of Desitin, not 2."
3,"Good product, but messy","This is a good product, but putting it in a tub is messy! It's really creamy and just gets everywhere. I ended up getting a plastic spoon and scooping it out onto a cotton round. This product is easier in a tube. Other than that- it's great for preventing diaper rash."
5,Syncs and Works Great!,"Easy to install, easy step by step instructions on how to couple the two of them together. I wish they weren't so pricey, but otherwise, they do exactly what they said they would do. I live in a 3000 sq foot split level and have one in the basement and the other upstairs and they communicate well!!"
5,"Great product, fast shipping.","I ordered this product about 4:00 p.m. one day and received it on my porch by noon the very next day. The instructions are easy to follow and it comes with a DVD if you prefer to watch the instructions rather than read them. The alarms are extremely loud and communicate well to each other. I have four installed in my house and may add two more. I have only had them installed a few days, so I will see how well they continue to work in time. The manufacturer gives it a five year warranty. So far, the dual pack is the best way to go as it makes them a little more affordable."
3,"So far, so good","Because of the nature of the product, it's difficult to know (and I actually probably don't ever want to know) if it works!!!"
2,Doesn't work 15 feet in my Manhattan apartment,"Watch the video to set these up and link them. Forget the written instructions. I linked them when they were together and tested them. Next I moved them to the kitchen and utility closet 18' away. They didn't communicate. I tried moving them within 15'. They still didn't work. Moral to the story - they don't like solid apartment walls and the linking technology is to weak. First Alert says up to 50'. That would probably mean line of sight, out in an open parking lot with no RF nearby!I'm returning these after spending a couple hours. First Alert had a nice idea with weak signal strength. I would rate these a D- do to the week link RF. They may work better when working with thin sheet rock walls between floors...."
5,Easy to set-up,"The concept of these alarms are awesome and turns out they were very easy to setup. If you have a larger home where one of the detectors can't be heard by the sleeping occupants, I would recommend this type of system. I placed one in my garage to monitor if a fire occurred there. It would give my family advance warning to get out."
3,Nice! (Updated),"After looking at some upinspiring rice cookers, I decided to buy this as a replacement for my older one. It looks very pretty. My family has even commented on how pretty it looks on my counter. I thought I'll give 3 stars for it.In the first three months of use, it cooked rice alright. But, the not-stick coating has started to peel off. I haven't used it everyday. Looks like the quality is cheap. I know that the non-stick layer will come off over the time, but 3 months is too soon.It has the ""keep warm"" feature I personally don't like, because once you forget to unplug it and the cooker sits for more than 30 minutes, the rice at the bottom starts becoming crusty and brown.In summary, buy it only for looks and occasional use.Update: It may cook 10 cups of Long grain or Jasmine rice, but it can only cook 4-5 cups of the Indian varieties like Basmati and Sonamasoori. Also, the rice cooker spills all over the counter. I'm not going to use this anymore."
2,Poor Quality Components,"I have owned two of these Rival RC165's. The first lasted over 2 years, cooking rice at least twice a week. The rice came out fine, although it was quite often browned on the bottom. I usually gave it a stir just after the button popped, to minimize the scorching.The reason this device only gets 2 stars is that the heating element died suddenly one day. I purchased a replacement because it made the right amount of rice, and it was generally good. Just last week, the heating element on this one went too. It only lasted 6 months.To note: we never got the base wet or immersed in water. Rice batches varied from a single serving of white shortgrain to family-sized wild brown rice dinners. Brown rice almost never worked out. We used the steamer basket, but found it was faster to just steam veggies on the stove top. Next time I get a rice cooker, it will NOT be this one."
5,best bra ever!,This bra is perfect. It's pretty and comfortable and the straps fall on the perfect part of your shoulders. Also what I love about this bra is that the support is great because it has a wide band of lace that hugs the rib cage and gives just the right amount of lift. It's the perfect mix of comfort and sexiness.
3,Good deal,Cute but a little itchy! Looks good for short term use. Size is accurate. Color is cream- very cute. Would buy again
4,Like it,I was pleasantly surprised at this bra. I got it just for fun to wear but it is actually comfortable to wear for any occasion. but does run a bit small in the cup size if you like full coverage bras.
2,"Pretty, but poor fit/support","The underwire fit well, but the cups were insubstantial and were not supportive. I had to send them both back."
4,Special occasion bra,"I was hoping this could be a sexier everyday bra than what I already use (Vanity Fair Back Smoother bra), but it's just too low for me. It's fine under nice blouses when I'm going out, but it's not supportive enough for me to wear regularly (I'm a 36DD for reference). It fits great and I feel pretty hot in it so I just bought the matching bikini, and it's my new special occasion set."
2,"The bra was pretty, but....",I did not like the seam placement in the cups....it vastly took away from the style.The lace was very pretty though.
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,The language can be a little difficult on your first reading. The audio is fantastic. One of my favorite books either way.
3,Literary Analysis of Captains Courageous,"This story is by Rudyard Kipling, it is called Captains Courageous.In this book it shows the importance of working & surviving in the real world."
2,More opaque than expected,"This arrived very quickly, but it was more opaque than translucent (its surface almost appears painted) and then it was chipped on top of that. A bummer! But I'm giving it two stars for the fast shipping."
3,"Well-Written, but Too Sad","Virginia Henley is a gifted writer. Her books stand out among the best. This book was also well-written. My problem with it was the very sad turn of events it takes. It was too much. Even though the ending made up for it, I was too wrung out."
4,I think it went well.......,"I am a real estate agent and I sent this to one of my clients this year for the holidays. From the sound of their feedback when they called me, they loved it. They were eating it as they were talking to me, actually. I never saw the product, but I can tell you that the people that received it seemed to really love it."
2,NOT overflowing,"I ordered this for my ""have everything"" father-in-law because he loves snacks himself and shares them with visitors. Fortunately, I had this sent to me instead of shipping it to him because he would have told me it was wonderful and I wouldn't have known the truth. I suspect that this has happened to quite a few buyers who gave this as a gift and the recipient didn't complain so the buyers wrote a good review. It is absolutely NOT overflowing with goodies as stated in the description. The picture is very misleading. The basket is not nearly as full as the picture shows. I could have put together a larger basket with more variety for less money. We ended up buying a few more items from a local shop and putting them into the box with the basket. I would have returned it if it had arrived at our home sooner. It took it quite a bit more time to ship than other items ordered on the same day and we received it four days before Christmas."
3,Not as good as the movie,"I liked this book, but I liked the movie better and that doesn't happen a lot. Great story and interesting characters."
5,No statute of limitations on Treason,"The law is there for a reason, and there's no good reason that Jane escaped it. 30 years is nothing, and whether she's sorry or not is meaningless in the shadow of facts. Letting go because of time elapsed is not justice and not a sufficient argument for disdain of this well written book."
3,"One of my least favourite of L'amour's books, lacks humour","Kilrone is an ex-army man comes across a massacre of I-company and realises that the nearby fort is in danger. His trip there literally takes him back to the past. Denise the woman he used to love is there, as is her husband, and on a more sinister note, Iron John has set up business there. Last time Kilrone dealt with Iron John he might have won but he had been forced to retire.Iron John, it seems, is dealing with the Indians, more particularly Medicine Dog an upstart fighter who wants more weapons. Now the fort is in danger and there is only Kilrone who can hold it until the troops come back.I think Iron John last turned up in Fallon and this book is like a poor reflection of that - at least to me. Fallon was funny and wry. This one seems to take itself really seriously. I loved the easy Western humour of Fallon, but this one was more of a pedestrian read. Readable but wouldn't try again in a hurry."
3,Poor for L'Amour,"I'm sorry for anyone who would judge Louis L'Amour entirely after reading this book. It was one of his poorer works. L'Amour writes about a man named Barney Kilrone. He was an ex-soldier who had been given a raw deal and blamed for something he had never done. He finds himself in the middle of a bad situation that entangles him in a mess of renegade indians, massacres, and jealousy, and a drunken commander who seeks notoriety. In the end he saves the day and gets the girl, but not the girl some might have expected. Although the ending was rushed as others have stated, I did like the fact that the main villian was finished off by someone other than the main character. Take a look at this one despite it's low rating."
5,All Books written by Louis L'Amour,"My Mother,(God rest her soul) starting me reading books by Louis LaAmour when I was 40 years old. I'm now 72 and I haven't had a bad book yet? Louis was a great story teller. One that will put the reader right in the middle of the story, and you don't want to put it down until you are finished it. I've read all his western books in paperback at least three times. I neverget tired rereading them. Then my wife bought me a Kindle, and I've started all over again. Itslike meeting old friends."
4,it's a wrench and works,"It does what it supposed to do. Only thing missing that you'll likely find yourself needing is a Phillips screw driver. I already had a small one, so I have now complaints there."
5,Great inexpensive apple mouse.,"Great inexpensive apple mouse, won't disappoint. Works like the original my computer came with, no complaints."
3,Clean and worn???,"The coin I purchased does not look like the advertised picture. It's important to understand the risk of purchasing items like this.Two things I dislike about my purchase:The coin is very worn, aside from seeing the outline of Liberty and the perched Eagle on the opposite side there is very little detail, this is expected of a coin that is 70years old but far from good condition.The coin is shiny. For as old as this coin is and for as worn as my particular one is, I expected more patina (Like shown in the picture) which is evident to me that the coin was cleaned/polished to make it look like shiny valuable silver. This is FALSE, it destroyed the value of the coin.I'm content with the convenience of ordering this semi-rare item but not 100% satisfied with the coin I received, then again it's a coin toss with these things. Three Stars."
4,silver half,"As advertised, in good shape, quick delivery. Overall happy with purchase. Would recommend to anyone trying to diversify some savings in silver."
2,Vertical laptop roller bag,"There's nothing ""wrong"" with this product, but I don't like it. I bought it because it stated it is narrow enough to use on planes or buses. The truth is, it's not. It's also pretty heavy and I had bought it because I have a bad neck and need something I can roll behind me instead of carrying it. I've gone back to a carrying bag rather than use this one."
5,Maybe I got a bad one,"I personally did not care for it. It had a non-smothering smoked pepperoni flavor which was pleasant for me but it had too much beef heart for my taste. It wasn't bad, just not my thing. choochoo was awesome with same day shipping as usual."
2,kinda bland and a little sweet,"I'm sure plenty of folks would love this product but it's not for me. It's a little bland and a little too sugary for me. When I say a little, I do mean a little. It's not extremely bland or really sugary but I like a stronger stick with more spice. Maybe they assumed I was a sissy for ordering the turkey sticks. I was hoping for a healthier version of the stuff I like."
4,Long time Jerky / Smokie eater honest thoughts,"Every flavor was good, honestly. The Ham sticks had a little too much clove flavor, but were still decent. The big complaint, and maybe this is the intended style, was they were not hard enough or chewy enough. Too soft, almost like store bought hot dog. In fairness some were more firm then others, and the outer shell or skin was itself stiff on all of them. You sort of get used to this lack of firmness and soon look past it, but it is what is keeping me from ordering again anytime soon. My favorite and by enough to only order this specific flavor the next time was the Teriyaki, which was a surprise because I expected it to be the Spicy as number 1 and the Mild as number 2. Definitely worth a try if you are considering something new."
4,Like remembering a dream,"What a strange and beautifully written novel. It's written in reverse timeline, as the protagonist (called at different times, Lillian, Patsy, Beautiful, Princess and Winnie), a more-than-a-little loony bag lady, attempts to recreate her own life while at the same time trying to forget some of the more painful parts.The reader is left to figure out what is truth, what is a figment of Winnie's imagination, what is a result of her mental illness, and what is just pure creation on her part in order to keep herself from feeling pain too deeply.The storyline brought to mind the movie ""Memento"" where the main character suffered from short-term memory loss and had to tattoo reminders onto his body. Like ""Memento,"" ""Remember Me"" plays with the idea of truth and memory, and the secrets we tell to -- and keep from -- even ourselves."
2,Improving on Longer Acquaintance :-),"I'm sorry, I gave up after p. 72. I knew the old woman had been through some kind of major trauma, but I got annoyed with the constant back-and-forth technique and the endless with-holding of details. The voice -- yeah, it had emotion. But not enough to interest me past p. 72. Frankly, it was a bore.I wrote the above a few days ago. Then I read the review from someone who said she nearly gave up but kept on going and the book does get better. Something about what that reader said made me pick up the book again. AND-- I want to thank her, because she was so right. When the girl arrives at Aunty Ena's place, the book stops being tiresome and becomes something beautiful."
1,Cheap for a reason,"Apparently the ""slim"" description refers to the height of the wallet and not the thinness. Bills will stick out about a quarter of an inch. This wallet is poorly designed unless you live in a country that uses smaller currency than the US. For me, this is a deal breaker. I hope the return process is not that difficult."
4,Good value,"After looking around I realized that I couldn't find anything thiner that was afordable, looked and was made by a company like Sony. The first one I bought developed a problem with the CD player after 3 or 4 years. I bought another one and loved the fact that the holes in the cabinet still matched. My son fixed the first one and I now use it at our vacation house."
3,under the cabinet cd player,Size is bigger than I expected. I was expecting metallic finish but it is greyish. I did not install under my cabinet and returned the merchandise.
4,Works,I used it today for the first time. Works fine. The only thing I wish it was made with thicker material. I think it could rip easy but I guess time will tell. Other wise it worked good and I was able to use the hole in the middle to put my finds in.
4,"i think nas is a great rapper, everything he touches is hot","I can't tell you about my review because I've never heard the tape. Just like I said in one he is a very talented rapper, and I believe he does his best on all his albums. My job is not to criticize but prophesie that he will do the best job that he can do."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS BOOK!,"I am extremely disappointed in this text. Not only does it have the most basic of information, it is poorly written and edited.Spelling, Diction, and Grammatical errors are abound in this text.One example of poor diction, ""Wreck diving integers many divers"". Intrigues and Integers are very different words.The index does NOT match page numbers. Wreck diving is listed in the index as being on pages 38-40, but does not appear in the book until page 43.Authors, editors, publishers AND retailers should be ashamed to have this text associated with them.I am attempting to return my copy for a refund.Oh, I gave it one star because the review process would not allow anything less."
4,So you've been waiting too?,"The newest Spearhead joint is quite good, but not quite groundbreaking. I was hoping for more of Michael's deep soulful lyrics, and a few more upbeat tracks, but the new album is definitely worth buying. You can clearly hear the influence of Sly and Robbie throughout the album, which can be a very good thing, or a little too close to ""Hey Baby"" by No Doubt. The hooks are there. The beats are there. Michael's unparalleled voice shines through. But SOMETHING is missing. Am I fronting? Yeah. I couldn't produce one track as good as any on the album, but then they've spoiled us with their past work. I would put ""Home"" and ""Stay Human"" in front of the newest release for overall quality, but add this to the quiver and let jah provide the rest. By the way, If you're reading this Michael, you are still the coolest brother on the planet. All the freaky people owe you a hug, and a lefty."
5,Comic misery at its finest,"Ah, Celine, Celine, how can anyone read this book and not laugh out loud at this least 10 times a chapter? What lightning fast wit the narration possesses. Leave it to the french to spawn an inspiration that lasts thru the ages like this has. Great things to say about the hollowness of patriotism, everyday mundane existence, and even flea counting! The fact that it's so funny in the midst of all its pessimism is proof that Celine has his moments of true compassion. He understood exactly what was going on. And maybe after you're done reading this, you will, too.A rare, and all too knowing literary treat."
1,Journey to Bed,"Celine seems like the attempt here was to write 'the' great coming of age/teen angst novel, but instead, published the stuff from his wastebasket. This is as poor of a storyline as this 'book' ever develops. It's impulsive and boring at the same time, timid and defiant against only the reader. Unless you are buying this for the sheer challenge of completing a miserably confused and malleable author's diary, I recommend ANY OTHER BOOK."
1,Journey to the end of the night,"I have to admit that after reading this book and its follow on ""I am a masochist."" From the start, it is almost impossible to describe the levels of self debasement Celine puts his character through. The direction that any chain of events will follow is clear after the first three sequences. Down! In most cases they don't start on a very high plane.I don't believe for a minute that the scenarios pulled screaming from Celines mind are something the reader will carry with him / her after having have thrown the book down in disgust. The general feeling, yes, anything else, no.The writing style, at least as translated, is a slow go.As to why I finished it, the first sentence is my confession and excuse. There was something that held me. The friend who recommended kept asking, ""weren't they funny?"" To that I can state, for me a resounding ""NO"". He asked, ""Were they good?"" The answer to that is given above."
5,The best and original.,"I like Manha De Carnaval so much that I listened to Domingo, Nana Mouskouri, Carly Simon and Luis Miguel's versions borrowed from the libraries. I like the original song in track 6 by Luiz Bonfa. Track 8 guitar playing is also beautiful. Track 11 female vocal is wonderful, spontaneous and second to none. The sound quality is excellent."
4,excellent album,j'étudie la musique et nous devons jouer du louis bonfa. J'adore ses samba et bossa-nova. C'est vraiment excellent
5,I felt guilty reading this it was so good!,"Ages 4-8??? Paleeze! This one is timeless, a true must read for all ages! Who says religion can't be fun."
1,Good,I like this CD. Nearly all the songs on it are really strong lyrically compared to the other 2 albums. Musically though this is not as unique as the others. I'd like to see her do another album on the other end of the spectrum. Less commerical sounding with more old timey.
5,Her best song ever,It's funky and sexy and I really like it. The remixes are okay but why not include an extended mix???
1,Not Even Trying To Be Her Perogative... Just A Disgrace,"It always comes to my attention about manufactured ""Corporate Pop"" right now. Yet, there are some that really have exceled very well in the image, but there are some that overexpose themselves to where the music is cheap, and the image outweighs the feeling to the songs. For Britney Spears, she has done that actually very well this year with her 2 fastlove marriages, and she still can't carry a tune with covers either. Her remake of Bobby Brown's My Perogative, the recent track from her Greatest Hits record is one of the worst covers I've ever heard. The song itself is very dark and doesn't really have that upbeat new jack swing feeling that Bobby originated in the 80's. As for Britney, I honestly suggest you don't listen to this one, and listen to Bobby's version instead. Not since Britney Spears 2000 remake of the Rolling Stones Satisfaction have I ever heard such a very poor cover song ever.Overall: F-"
5,Great product. Very Well Built and Solid,"The quality is way better than what I expected, and it's holding my monitors very securly. I like the added flexability of being able to go from portrait to landscape very easily and setup was a breeze.Regarding the other review about it being too loose. I actually had the opposite problem. Mine was too tight.But not a big deal (and shouldn't be a big deal for the guy that complained about i being too loose). You can actually adjust the tightness for all of the joints. Just pop off the plastic covering of the joint and you will see some bolts. Grab a wrench and tighten away (or loosen in my case).Love it. It's great."
3,Excellent if you're already a fan.,"I have to admit I definitely enjoyed this book. However, that is mainly because I love the Dune universe itself. Taken as a work of science fiction literature, I found this wanting on several levels. Most of the characters became extremely flat, especially Shaddam IV and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. The pacing was off, too - in a prequel series, you can't threaten to destroy the universe to build suspense near the end. There has to be something or someone we actually care about in serious danger. All the good suspense scenes thus came early, such as the beginnings of the ""Great Spice War"" and whether Amal would succeed in any fashion.Still, though, we get to see more of the Landsraad, the noble houses, and the characters we've come to enjoy."
4,"Another great effort, looking forward to more.","After years of reading the Dune books over and over again, I have happily consumed the three prequil books. House Corrino at times seems somewhat forced after expanding plots lines and then having to contract them back to the original Dune. But it is quiet enjoyable and interesting to see how get back to the beginning.I eagerly awaiting for a four prequil with the Bene Gesserit to bring us the beginning of Dune. And I can image a series dealing with the beginnings of the Great Houses, Guild, Gesserits and the Buterian Jihad. Its a rich universe and moving backward 10,000 years would be great."
5,Prelude to Dune; House Corrino,"It is a good book. I may only be 15, but i know a good book when i see one. I believe Frank Herbert would have been pround of this prelude. Much easier to read then the original done series.:)BYE!!moosemaniac."
4,A must for Dune fans,"Dune: House Corrino will make for an enjoyable return to the universe created by Frank Herbert, and kept alive by his son and Kevin Anderson. Every Dune fan I know has curiosity about the history and politics in the Dune universe. DHC ties together the events of the earlier two books in this trilogy, laying the groundwork for a very plausible beginning to the original Dune novel. Anderson and the younger Herbert lack some of Frank's deftness with presenting exceptionally unique characters, and Prince Vernius in DHC could be considered by some to be a little ""over the top."" However, these flaws are minor and will not detract from your enjoyment. Old fans: shake off the dust and embrace the new- pick it up and read it. Newbies: I recommend starting either with the original ""Dune"" or with ""Dune: House Atriedes."""
2,What happened???,"Yes House Harkonnen was not as good as the first novel but what hapened here? It's almost as though they kept the downward spiral going as each book progressively gets worse. I liked Atredies and enjoyed Harkonnen but this edition was pitiful. The first half is boring and simple. Never really gets to anything especially since I thought the second book set it up to be exciting. Then the second half, while picking up the pace, it seems as though the authors were bored and couldn't wait to start the butlerian Jihad trilogy. They just kind of hurry things along and wrap up the story with no real compelling conclusions. The last few chapters are so simple I felt cheated. If you have started the series you have to pick this book up to finish it off but don't expect to have an real compelling ending."
5,Moonlighting,"Brilliant, taut suspense, and Jeremy Irons acting as opposed to standing around looking deep and meaningful. Very witty, well worth seeing several times. Deserves much more exposure than it had"
2,Tedioius,"Jeremy Irons was his usual great, and it's an interesting story line. However, two hours of listening to one person's voice was more than low-budget. As my son said, ""I want those two boring hours of my life back."""
3,"""Global Warming Edition""?","You've got to be kidding. Is there nothing sacred that the ""capitalists in hippie clothing"" global warmies won't desecrate?Absolutely shameless.This classic 1960s fantasy was just that, a fun but ridiculous fantasy - not a prediction of things to come. It was created in the day when every problem that mankind faced was solved with a nuke. It was also created in a day when the atmosphere was a heck of a lot more polluted than it is today.Slapping a ""Global Warming"" label on this movie is almost as utterly absurd as the religion that Global Warming has become. With NASA data showing that the hottest years on record are all in the 1930s (1934 being the hottest), and the coldest, record-setting years on record are 2006, 2007 and 2008, I'm dumbfounded as to how many ""sheeple"" buy into this global warming propaganda."
4,It still manages to stay afloat after all these years,"One of Irwin Allen's earliest cinematic works. Good entertainment for a sci-fi flick even though the plot involves a global disaster that is totally improbable. Also, this movie has something that for some reason was missing from the TV series, female characters!"
4,"Good film, Very Good Edition","As always, The Pilot VTTBOTS is in some ways superior to the series. A pretty suspensful film, well written, good color special FX...the 'Global Warming' Addition to the DVD is great, and *also* includes some excellent history of Science Fiction. Get this edition if you buy the film."
4,Stylish,"I am using this keyboard with my Win XP PC and it works perfectly. It fortunately came with a USB extension cord. It is quite stylish but this inadvertently makes my Logitech mouse and Viewsonic monitor look sadly ancient. My only real complaint would be that it isn't equipped with a pair of feet to increase the keyboard angle.Compared with a decent Microsoft PC keyboard, I noticed that on the Apple keyboard (1) the distance between the surfaces of two adjacent keys is shorter, (2) the surface of each key is flatter, and (3) the height difference between an unpressed and pressed key seems smaller. This gives the keyboard a softer/fuzzier feel that some people might not like or might need a little time to adjust to."
2,I can't wait to get rid of mine!,"I've been struggling to like this kb for about a year, but I've finally ordered a MacAlly replacement. It's a funny kb with a spongy feeling and close-spaced keys. I'm not that picky about kbs -- I use about 7 regularly, and only this one drives me bats. My old iBook kb and my new MacBook kb are both far more comfortable for me.It's all personal. This one makes my hands ache. On the bright side it's clean looking, stylish, and compact. I just wish I liked it!The USB ports are 1.x and won't charge anything over 100 mA btw. Still, they'll work on a mouse just fine."
5,Apple USB Keyboard,This keyboard has the feel of the old IBM keyboards. I just wish Apple would make more keyboards like this one. I would highly recommend this keyboard to everyone.
3,Marginal Sound,"Astrud Gilberto is without a doubt the best known female bossa nova singer in the world. The problem with this rerelease is that the sound quality is marginal at best. It sounds as if the producers just rerecorded the original cuts without digitally improving on old technology. But for those who are long time fans will find most of her old favorites here, and find it fun for nostalgic reasons."
5,christine ebersole is amazing,great recording of the off broadway showchristine ebersole is truly amazingthis role will make her a broadway legend
5,Wonderful score,I was pleasantly surprised. I think the score is terriffic. I am not sure why the critics did not give it more praise.
1,Never again,It's rather dull and boring in my point of veiw. I love musicals but the music for this one did nothing for me.
5,Good,"The stand says what it is supposed to do. adds extra space to a desk by creating tiers. saves space and is quite simple. i have a 22"" widescreen and it JUST fits on there so im happy for that."
2,Ehhh,"I just finished watching this film and well it was baddd. I understand what they were trying to do but the writing was just horrible. It didnt help that the acting made it hard to watch. It looks like a high school student film and the writing was soo forced. They swore way too much making it seem so unnatural, so forced. The best part of this movie was the poetry that was shown. The very ending credits were nice and i hate to knock the film because I think the message was important but man this movie was horrible. Bad acting, Bad script, and Bad filming. There are way better movies with the same important message of understanding and love...I say go watch some of them instead..."
4,worth the price,"Very sturdy, Very good features although there is rooom for improvement, quite heavy, but I suppose that should be expected for the sturdiness, and overall worth it, especially at only (...)"
3,HUGE!!,"This case is HUGE!! It's like carrying a suitcase. I had a 15"" laptop and it's way too big for it. If you want portability, this is not the case you want."
4,good british period fim,good british period film dealing with murder music and gay lifestyle in 1977 england.the film has something for everyone. music of the disco era gay/straight relationships and mystery.acting is good and story moves at a fairy decent pace.
2,"Just a romance, really","shlocky. Not exactly fine prose. But if you like easy reads, why not? Andit was free for the kindle, too."
3,Great Potential,I finished this book because I thought the potential for a great story was there. It just didn't hold together as I thought it could and so in the end I was disappointed.
4,Takes flop out of flipping!,What can I say -- it works wonderfully -- whenever you need to flip something when cooking this is what you need! It is great even for just mixing things like frying potatoes. Takes cookies off cookie sheets nicely. Use your imagination!
3,Not Bad,"I was a little disappointed with this tome. Maybe I was expecting the same vein as ""Chuck Amuck"" but at times the text rambled and wandered about. I loved the sketches, cells and other artwork, which is why I got this book in the first place. Its fascinating to watch a character develop both in the mind of the artist as well as on paper. Animated cartoons have come a LONG way from the 1920's and Jones played a TREMENDOUS part in bringing them up to quality. It's a shame we lost Chuck and it seems like there is really no one to fill in for him. But I doubt that anyone could, his work is that good. And sad to say, the current crop of cartoons being churned out now is FAR BELOW Jone's standards."
2,Bonus Tracks not a bonus,Tin Pan Alley on the bonus tracks..one of the best songs ever by this guy....it cant be declared a bonus track...it isnt the full song..its only part of it.Very dissapointed that you have stated it has a bonus track and its not what it is at all.
5,One of the greatest blues albums EVER!,"In 1983 a power trio named Stevie Ray Vaughan blew us all away with the blues debut Texas Flood. Blues-rock was never any better. Not when the Rolling Stones had their glory years or even when Led Zeppelin released their amazing debut.(Before they turned metal.) This is the essential blues-rock album, and the key to enjoying it is the guitar. Stevie rips through each song with a long solo or addictive riff while howling into the mic to prove he got the blues. The best song would be Texas Flood, a song that would be an amazing opus on stage. The entire album is his most consistent with not a single bad song and blistering instrumentals. (including the soulful Lenny that will leave your heart heavy.) This is blues rock done better than ever. If this doesn't prove to you that Stevie Ray Vaughan is, next to Jimi Hendrix, the greatest guitarist ever nothing will. If you have a thirst for blues rock buy this right NOW!"
5,Before anything was,"This is as usual a good book by Gene Edwards. He has a way of bringing to life every person he writes about. This is a novel, but I really enjoy his work."
2,"Great sound,buuuut,...","Ya know,..I didnt think I'd ever have to write one of these negative type reviews.I have never had a problem with things I bought on Amazon.However,..these earphones,while sounding incredible,..dont work well,after just a few weeks.They're a pain,really. When I got them,they were fine,but after only two weeks of use(not hard use either) they go out at the point where the cord meets the plugin.I mean,I dont move them around much,just to put them on and take them off at my PC desk. I have to manipulate the cord until the sound comes back on.I tried to duct tape it so that the cord would stay in the right place,but that isnt working either.So,I have to keep trying and moving the plugin and cord round so that I can find a place that I can hear them.I do love the total depth of sound though.So,I guess I'll have to look for another set soon,and keep these until then.Damn it.I've only had these for about 2 1/2 months is all. They really do sound great too. Sad,... :("
3,Good Sound and Ok Comfort...,"I purchased these headphones looking for a great pair for my iPod. My first impression when I took them out of the box was that they look decent and hoped they were. I tried them on and I didn't like them at first but after a day or two they felt better but not as nice as I had hoped.Pros:The cord is very long and its thickThere is a lot of bass (if you like it)It comes with an adapterCons:Although it fit my head good, it wasn't tight enough so if I moved they would slide around (that was a big negative for me)Overall I am disappointed in them. I hope to return them"
5,Great value.,"Excellent quality headphones. I couldn't be happier. I highly recommend. These replaced a pair of noise cancellation headphones from Sharper Image. These cost about half the price and they are more comfortable and sound much richer. Plus, they don't need batteries! Worth every penny!"
5,Great headphones,"I'm not deeply into music, but I do enjoy great sound and that's what I get from these. Very very satisfied."
2,"Uncomfortable and requires too much ""tuning""","Unfortunately I was only able to wear these for about an hour before they became painfully uncomfortable. I adjusted and re-adjusted them with no luck over several days. I've since ordered another pair that sit around the ear and I've already worn them for several hours at a time.These also took quite a bit of ""fine-tuning"" to get a decent to moderate sound out of. I say that because I was very unhappy with the level of distortion, especially if listening to any music with heavy bass.The only reason for 2 stars is that even though they are extremely uncomfortable for me, you can tell that they are well made, and they are very comfortable to wear around your neck due to the foldable cups."
4,Great for the price,"The clarity was great! Sound wise it isn't the best compared to other ones, but for the price definitely was worth it. I mainly use it for my laptop for movies and music. They are very comfortable and stay in place that is very nice."
5,100%,This headphone is really fantastic peas of artand it would be even batter if it has a built-in microphone
2,Good sound but Hurts,"These had great sound but they hurt my head so much! I could not have them on for longer than 20 min without having to give my cranium a rest. Lots of headaches, so I sent it back. Perhaps its just my low pain tolerance or small head, but thats my personal experience."
4,Impressive Sound Quality,"I'm not a professional musician or sound technician/mixer by any count. However, I am in a band and wanted a good quality headphone to be able to better hear all the different parts in a song. Earbuds tend to miss the finer details of what's being played. These, on the other hand, play everything. I can hear exactly how many instruments are playing, what they're playing, vocals, harmonies, everything. The sound isolation is fantastic. I could not hear people 3 feet away from me talking. The only reason I'm giving these 4 stars instead of 5 is that the playback is not quite as loud as I would like. I still have to turn the volume up to half its maximum to be able to really hear everything. However, well worth it for what I get to hear."
4,Good value in its range,"Finding a pair of decent-sounding closed headphones at less than 50USD is far to be easy. The typical sound of those is boomy, with strange reverberation effects and a poor sound. The ATH-M30 provide a warm sound, with a solid bass (sometimes a bit undefined), a smooth midrange and a correct trebble. The feeling is perhaps not the ""outstanding clarity"" advertised but rather a relaxing sound, with a good balance between details and fun. Compared to the sennheiser HD212, the trebble is a bit lacking but, at least, the bass doesn't kill the midrange.These headphones are well-built and will probably last. I only regret the absence of a collapsable capacity."
4,"Good quality, was hoping for a little louder, though....","These are great headphones. They possess absolutely amazing sound quality, which is a must for me being an audiophile on a budget. However, I have noticed that they could be a little louder. My iphone and computer don't have the ability to get these bad boys up to their high volume range. I think this problem lies solely with modern day mp3 equipment and computer monitor outputs. I also hook these up to my many amps, and I get some good volume out of those.Summary:Great quality, a little quiet for everyday useDesigned more for people who need a budget pair in a studio"
3,Depends on what you want . . .,"First off, I am well aware that one must ""burn in"" headphones, and I did that for a solid 50+ hours. These cans offer pretty good isolation from external noise, but were definitely not comfortable for me. I am not a large guy, nor do I have a big head, and they felt really tight. That would probably improve over time as they probably loosen up a bit, but definitely not good right off, especially if wearing glasses. As for sound - pretty good. As compared to Sennheiser PX-100's, which I know is somewhat an apples to oranges comparison because the Senn's are open back, they weren't quite as good. So if you don't need the isolating aspect of the cans, I would definitely opt for the Senn's as they are infinitely more comfortable and much lighter. And now I'm ready for the spelling police, and the ""you don't have the exact same opinion as me"" police to write replies slamming my opinion - get to it."
1,Don't waste your time!,The second time I used this product it started breaking and had a short in the wire! Don't waste your money!
5,Great set of headphones.,"I use them for music and audio monitoring. Doesn't completely block out the outside noise, but it gets the job done well enough. For the price, great choice of headphones."
4,Does the job,"To begin with I am not an audiophile. In fact I have hearing aids and wouldn't know quality sound response from a rifle shot. I got these headphones to cancel out the noise coming from the community lunch table just outside my desk area at work. For this purpose these headphones do a great job. They comfortably fit over my ears. I turn up the volume and I am in my own world free of the din outside my workstation. The ear muffs are very comfortable and the cord is much stronger and thicker than expected. For what I can hear, the sound coming from these headphones is great. They are the nicest headphones I have ever owned, but this is coming from a guy who has never had anything better than the headphones that came with a Walkman."
5,great,Good head phones . Great deal for price. Will be buying the m 50s :) Love these headphones super goog
5,Outstanding Perfornance,"Everything written and said about the headphone is true. Absolutely delightful sound. Very balanced and rich sound. They make most of your music collection new by bringing out hidden instruments and lesser notes. All frequencies well balanced and not too much emphasis on Bass. This makes them very nice for Indian music especially. Although bulky, but at this price, there are few things better than these."
3,"Great sound, poor wiring quality.","The reason I purchased these headphones was because of the great reviews on their sound quality and their price. I'm no pro, but they sound great, have a depth of field, nice highs and lows and are very comfortable even for long periods.However, the wiring into the headphone connector seems to be a bit shoddy. There is a spring to protect strain, etc. But from out of the box if the wire gets bumped or pulled while being plugged in I lose sound in the right ear. I was kinda disappointed. Other than the issue with the wiring these deserve 5 stars."
3,Not noise cancelling,"I have no idea how sound sounds though these, but they are not noise cancelling. If that's what you're looking for, keep looking."
5,Best performer of paganini's 24 caprices,"Many people understand that Paganini's 24 Caprices is considered one of the hardest pieces to play for the violin. Many people have tried(i.e Yo Yo Ma, Perlman, etc) but they cannot pull it off as well as Ricci can. His great skill makes these caprices sound something decent. Of course, nobody can play his caprices perfectly, but ricci comes very close"
5,Love This Series,"As a teenager, I loved this series. It wasn't until I reached college myself that I could truly appreciate the genuine truth and simple magic that this series created each episode. A bittersweet ending to this series, I loved this season and know that if you followed it faithfully, that any viewer will too!"
4,they couldn't help it!...,"i love this show,it's one of my favorite but i don't understand the choice of the replaced songs.first of all,there are songs which are taken out from their context (displaced (azure ray),not what i wanted (evan olson),goodbye (the crash poets),loose ends (sinead lohan),for exemple)and put on a previous season episode as it was originally featuring on THIS season.anyway,some of the replaced songs are OK,but other of them sucks! specially the ones which taken place of ryan adams and chantal krevizuk's songs!...well,despite of that this is one of the best season of the show after season 1 and i'm really glad to own it on DVD because in france,where i'm from,the show was cancelled only after 5 or 6 episodes!..."
4,Gal Costa spoils it,"Jobim recorded this live album with friends. While the music is excellent on the whole, Gal Costa's performance is really annoying, although I like Gal Costa very much. She even has a double album (Gal Costa Canta Tom Jobim) where she only things Jobim and she does it perfectly, but I think she had a bad day when this album was made."
5,"Ten Cc, they are one of the most underrated artists!","I was ordering a Carol King C.D. when the band's name came to mind. Their style is a great mixture of soul, blues, and funk! The lyrics will make you have a smile on your face while listening. They sure know how to use the English language to congure up the images that the music portrays. This C.D. is on my top 10 list."
1,ugh !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I hated this movie. we came across it on amazon and my 6 yr old had to have it .. i put it in our wish list i got it at walmart and it took an hour away from my life . it was sooo boring in alot of parts i wanted to sleep . even my 6 yr old hated it and she loves sharks...
4,Great Movie,Enjoyed the movie! I never was able to put the DVD on hold to get another bag of popcorn. This is one of those movie you're focused to the tube because you never know what else is going to happened.
3,Ok to pass some time on a slow night.,"Well, just an o.k. movie. The scenery is nice, acting not bad, but if your looking for a movie to really scare you with graphics, giant shark and body parts coming off, this isn't the movie. I have to admit, you can feel the terror coming from the characters when they realize the shark is following them."
2,Read the shorter version,"Having exhausted Austen for the time being and seeing that Cranford was funny and touching I began reading the Wordsworth Classics edition of Wives and Daughters. For about 300 pages I was thinking this is really good but at about page 385 nothing seemed to be jelling so I put it down for a few days only to start again at the end to find that the author died before she had finished. There was enough to go on however so that wasn't a big problem. The problem is that the really sad husband/wife relationship was never developed (did I miss it?)I would really advise anyone to read Wives and Daughters:In Half the Time instead of this. Normally I would not want to read a condensed book. For Instance, Thackeray's Vanity Fair must be read in all of its 743 page glory.But see the movie Vanity Fair (first?) The long one."
3,"Eh, but the water bottle...?","I like this for my mouse, it's a perfect size for him because he is extra tiny, but the water bottle leaks constantly and has soaked through his bedding and he hates it."
5,Great guide to an underused resource,"Harriman State Park (NY) is about 30 minutes outside of NY City. The main areas get crowded on late spring, summer and early fall weekends, but hike into the park a mile or so and you will find excellent and challenging trails virtually all to yourself. The Harriman Trails, A Guide and History gives the hiker many interesting facts on the trail they are contemplating hiking. It also gives the weary hiker the distance to the trail head ;) Great book. Too bad it's out-of-print. I was going to buy another one because my copy is dog-eared and worn."
2,"Not Really ""Love"" Poems","I was disappointed with this volume. The title said implied that these were ""love"" poems, but it seems that the most of them were poems about what jerks males were. Although I am sure that many, if not most, males are jerks, writing a poem about it does not really make it a love poem. Nevertheless, it was quite interesting to see what a great many women really feel about the men in their lives. One plus is that poems were included from many different times and cultures that allows one to get a broader perspective on the subject, however."
2,Thin Stock... Perforated... Why Bother?,"This product was quite a disappointment. Avery markets this as heavyweight postcard stock, but it is no such thing. Even two pieces held together would not equal an average postcard. I suppose that I can forgive the perforated edge, but it nevertheless gives the cards a decidely low-budget look.Caveat Emptor."
2,too loud,"This clock produces really big running sound. To make it a little bit quiet, I cut off the second hand.... but it doesn't help at all."
5,Super Clock,"Great clock, accurately tells time, highly decorative, very inexpensive. What more can one ask?As wall decoration, this clock is a super bargain."
3,too flimsy,This house looks great but is made from cardboard and so tears very easily. It might be okay for you if your toddler is very gentle with it - but our son reduced it to rubble after playing in it just a few times.
5,so much fun-bigger than we thought it would be!,This was a gift but i looked it up online before we opened the box to get an idea of what we were in for. It is bigger than I expected-i think we could almost fit a toddler bed in it! My daughter is stoked on it and we are happy with it to-the fact it folds up quite small for storage makes this house fantastic and easy to move from one room to another. My daughter will be 3 in two months and she is enjoying coloring it and playing pretend inside-she has especially enjoyed putting mail thru the two mail slots. pretty fun and i'd recommend it!
4,"Great play house, just bigger than I planned","We had an earlier cardboard playhouse. But with two new grand daughters, I needed a new one. The price & style were great. It arrived in perfect condition. It was easy to put together. MY WRONG , IT WAS MUCH BIGGER, then the old one. I need to read the descriptions more closely. It's a fine playhouse. I love the two doors."
5,play for hours*Play house,"Love it, easy to assemble. This is a great toy - it keeps my two daughters busy for hours! They color on it & love it, they play house with their dolls in it & have picnics with it. I have just purchased my third one, my friends kids come over to play & rave about it. Now it's one of my standard gifts to give!"
5,The only personal finance book a gay family needs.,"At long last, money advice we can actually use! Four Steps is the only personal finance book a gay family needs."
2,"To much American mind set, not enough japanese mind set.","The author seams to have predetermined that useing the bomb on Japan was a bad thing. Try reading ""Japans Longest Day"". It was writen by a group of Japanese historians about Aug. 13, 1945. It describes how untill the bomb was droped on Hiroshima the Japanese Government and Military leadership was planing to contest the war to the last Japanese life rather than suffer the indignity of surrender. This would have been at a much higher cost of human life than the 73,000 who died at Hiroshima and 45,000 that died at Nagasaki. the cost w/o the bomb could have quite possibly have been tens of millions of Japanese and the total destruction of Japanese culture, which did survive the bomb. Altho it was changed forever."
4,Good starting ground,"Takaki's book gives a good introductory account of the actions which led to America's use of atomic warfare. For someone looking for a quick overview of the American rationale for destroying two cities, it's a good read. However, it will ignite further interest as there is much more to be said and read on the subject. This is good, it is a subject more Americans need to learn about."
2,Not accurate enough to be useful,I was hoping to avoid buying a much more expensive model. The first day I had it I measured some of the corners in my house - 90.0 - 90.4 degrees- no problem. I then measured the angle of my table saw blade to the table - which must be exactly 90 to get a straight cut. I opened the Denali to 90.0 and double checked it with my square - it's off about 1/8th of an inch. With it open and square it reads 90.3.It's going back.
5,Every kid needs this!,My dad bought me this CD when I was 11 years old and it started a love of Jazz that I'm sure will last a lifetime! A great introduction for kids to Dixieland.
3,Decent condition but notes written and name on side,"Hardback is in decent condition but the previous owner's name is written in Sharpie along the side and some notes are written in the text, contrary to the advertised condition."
4,Cell and Molecular Biology Textbook,I received the product in a prompt manner and it was in excellent condition. I was very happy that I saved $100 by buying the book online instead of from my university bookstore. Thank you very much and I will definitely use Amazon and this seller again.
3,"OK for Free, but not for $150!","I received this on the internet for free and am very pleased with it. Although, I can say that because I didn't have to spend the amount others did. For $150, it really isn't that wonderful of a deal. I found out 32 MB doesn't go to far for MP3's and to upgrade another 32 MB is almost another $100! But the sound is good, the options are nice, and I don't know why others say it downloads slow, mine downloads pretty quick. So, if you're looking to buy this, I would suggest you look around a little more, I'm sure there is something out there better for the price."
1,No longer supported by Audiovox NO XP Support,"The MP-1000 has become useless since there is not currently and will never be support for Windows XP or 2000. Audiovox ""understands your frustration . . ."" but will no longer be providing support for their MP3 products and will not be providing any further software updates."
1,Didn't fit on multiple bikes,This seemed like a great idea and I thought I did my research before purchasing this product but it didn't fit on my bike or my boyfriends bikes. Seller never responded to my request to return. Thankfully I purchased through Amazon who helped me receive a full refund. Great idea but wouldn't use this company.
3,"Overpriced, but a good option for super-energetic dogs","I thought this was irksome to attach. And when you want to ride on your own, it's a hassle to remove. BUT, if you haven't taken the time/don't know how to train your dog, even a large, strong dog will not pull you off balance.All that said, If you have trained your dog with commands, you don't need to purchase any of this: all you need is a six-foot lead (this a normal length training leash) that clips around your waist (often called a ""Hands Free"" or ""Runner's Leash"") to give your dog a great run. I am a huge believer in ample exercise for dogs. We live in a condo and exercise makes all the difference in obedience, health and boredom level for our 40 lb. dog."
5,Outstanding Live Recordings,"This collection was recorded live in Chicago in 1961 during the peak period of success for the OP trio with Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen. There's a ton of great music on these 5 discs, and any fan of Oscar Peterson should buy this set - which is not widely available. It's well worth the search - 5 CD's, each having more than 60 mins of music; and good liner notes."
2,Teen Silverberg,"Silverberg wrote this when he was 18, and it shows. About 1 to 2 millions of today's SF teen fans could, and probably would have written this storyline better. What saves ""Seed of Earth"" from zero stars are the last 25 - 30 pages, where the story turns into an interesting psychological drama. Four persons, virtually strangers, are forced to live together in a cave. The tensions, the frictions and the insights into their characters are developed quite nicely (albeit with 50's self censorship of certain scenes). Here at least is the seed of the future great master, Robert Silverberg."
5,Best CD by SRV,This is my favorite CD by Stevie Ray. I believe it marks that pinacle of his career and captures the brilliance of his guitar genius.
2,Did anybody pay attention?,"I'm not ""bagging"" on the company but, whoever filled the order didn't know the difference between a Deluxe Edition and a regular CD."
3,IT TICKS,"It's cheap, it tells time. But its description said that it had a smooth second hand. Lies. For the smooth second hand, get the Seiko wall clock."
4,"Keeps Time, A Bit Noisy","Nice looking very plain clock. I have it in my home office where it does its job. If this was for a bedroom or even a living room, the very loud ticking would be too much."
5,Great,Wonderful price. Very fast shipping! Clock arrived quickly and keeps perfect time and it's easy to read from a distance.We are extremely happy with it.
3,Where oh where to attach my new line,"This clothes line means well when it states it does away with the poorly functioning suction cups found on similar products, but it leaves you with far worse...no way at all to attach. A great deal of making this work is left up to the end user and his or her own ingenuity in finding a way to hang it up solidly."
5,Excellent,It works great and very small and light. Attach clips to the ends and you can hook this to anything.
5,'I Scare Myself' one of the finest songs ever recorded.,"Not quite up to par with the 'Where's the Money' live lp but still filled with beautiful songs. Yeah, the LP cover opens like a matchbook. Cleva'. Dan always had style. The real point is to get every one of his 70's records because there's amazing songs on each one. This album probably is not well known out in the world. If you want humor/drivin' sound/violin/bluegrass/smarty pants lyrics/emotion in almost every song and going to a musical place that is like your own private vacation, buy this album. chrisbct@hotmail.com"
5,Love these things!,What great little treat makers. Using to make ice cream sandwiches for our daughters 6 birthday -- so easy to use and so fun!!!
3,CUTE but...,"So i received my package but it was kinda messed up, it wasn't a big problem because the product was still fine. i opened it and playing with them , but i didn't get the cookie recipe that should have came with my package , which makes me kinda irritated because it was suppose to come with the recipe. i mean i can Google another recipe , no big deal. but since i didn't get everything i paid for i would be nice if you put an email up so people can message you if they didn't get all of there items. so if anyone can post the recipe (who actually got it) that would be great so i can make these correctly. beside that there a cute idea and i can't wait to make them."
5,Bose SoundDock System Travel Case,I bought this item as a gift and the recipient loves it! Excellent product and it holds everything perfectly.
2,World War II The German Front,As a collector of WW2 items I would say this is very basic. Most of it is propaganda films.
1,not happy,"I hate to write this review,but the DVD did not play.No picture no sound.I tried two DVD players but nothing worked.I'm not going to return it,because it will cost more to return the DVD then it's worse.Needless to say I'm not a happy customer."
5,Helpful research,"This collection includes listings for difficult to find articles like interviews with secondary beats like Andy Clausen. With the Beat revival, this is a must-have reference for those researching Beat Generation."
1,Not worth the money...,I purchased this chair for my nephew who adores Blue. It popped within a couple of days... just came apart at the seams. James was so disappointed and I just can't bring myself to waste the money on a second one when clearly it is the quality of the product and not just a fluke.
2,Good While It lasted,When I saw the reviews for this item I thought that it would be ok since my daughter is just 2 and particularly gentle with her toys. I bought it anyway and my daughter absolutely loved it while it lasted which was about 3 weeks. One morning it just started deflating with no warning. It was a sad morning. A silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly morning.
5,Stevie at his best,This cd has it all! It rocks and also has guitar melodies that make Stevie Ray Vaughan one of the best guitarists to ever live. We love listening to this as it makes Stevie's work immortal. This is a great buy and is priced very well!
3,Not what I expected,"I thought this book was going to be more about detoxification through nutrition. Instead, it's about supplements you can take to alleviate nutritional deficencies. Baker does do a super job of showing the food/body/ health connection. He also clearly illustrates how all the body's systems and functions are connected and dependent on one another. This book is much more open minded and thoughtful in the art of healing than modern medicine, which refuses to admit that diet affects your health. It's a pretty good book but I wish he spent more time on actual foods than supplements."
2,Rather silly,"A muddled hybrid between Blair Witch Project and the Saw movies, ""Undocumented"" never manages to create the sense that you're watching real documentary footage, making each new ""sadistic torture"" scenario more unbelievable than the last. If these scenes of torment and danger had some creative wit to them then at least the movie might have achieved a semblance of social satire, but ultimately it is just a silly gorefest that exploits the illegal immigrant issue.I watched this because I'm a Scott Mechlowicz fan. He has done much better work in other films and should consider firing his agent over this mess."
1,Do Not Buy This!!!!,I Would Not Recommend Any One To This Product! I Have Order This Product And They Haven't Came In The Mail Its Been For Ever And Still Havent Got Them!
3,okay,"All the material here is very thorough, which leaves very little unclear about the material. I do have one hang-up with this text: the problems are uninteresting. Nearly all of the problems are trivial. The text to consult: ""A Book of Abstract Algebra"", Charles Pinter"
5,extremely though-provoking,"In 20 years in higher ed. in the social sciences, I am hard pressed to think of a book that immediately and permanently transformed the way I understand the world more than this one. It opens up hundreds of questions and is a delight to read. Probably the best starting point for a newcomer to Latour's ouevre, too."
5,Great read for fans of ghost stories...,"I must admit that I am weak for books like this one. I love taking them camping and reading the stories around the campfire. This book is particularly well researched and written. It isn't a bunch of ""stories"" but rather historical accounts about places in California that have a history about them. I have not even finished the book and felt I must give it the five-star ghost story recommend!"
2,OK tripod,"This tripod has a really good folded and extended size, pretty big when extended and small when folded. The clicking mechanism isn't that good. It's hard to fold and extend, and may move a little when you're using it.Update: This tripod lasted for about a year of very little use and then completely broke down. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Better spend a little more on a good quality tripod."
3,Zondervan NIV Matthew Henry Commentary,Over all I can't really say much since the print is so small and my eyes aren't that i have to wait until I can get a page size magnifier. I ordered this book on my sisters recommendation.
2,Disappointing Conclusion,"As someone owns virtually every book Sandra Brown has written, I am always eager to read her new novels. But, this one was very disappointing. The plot was seriously lacking. And the ending left me feeling very dissatisfied. It definitely was not one of her best efforts. If you are interested in a good Sandra Brown suspense book, read ""Mirror Image."""
2,"Violent, Dark, No Character Development","Sandra Brown is making the jump Tami Hoag has already done, replacing romance and character development with graphic voilence and murder mystery that should not sell under Romance. Sandra Brown has a rich history of characters who break your heart and make you laugh, this story has none. She does not develop any character but the evil brothers. It is a shame."
3,A let-down,"It has been a while since the last book. The plot is interesting, the characters sufficiently developed. But I didn't like the ending where Jack told his story. I guess this shows the characters are flawed, and not altogether 'heros', but his story was just too horrific. Whatever happened, it seemed like he is a murderer. I prefer Sandra's past novels - more romance please!"
3,Cole Does a Great Job,"I've never listened to an audiobook read by Gary Cole, and I was very impressed by his performance. However, I have to agree with many other reviewers and say that, beyond Cole, this book is nothing special. Yes, it's violent, but that didn't surprise or upset me. Characters like Cecil, Carl and Myron are violent and ugly. It wasn't the sex that bothered me, either. Instead, it was the ending. I didn't believe a single word pertaining to Jack's ""real identity."" I wish Brown had taken greater care in crafting a finish to her book."
2,Unspeakably bad writing,"The plot could have been interesting but I found myself wishing the book would end....it was boring and poorly written. I am not a fan of Romance books and perhaps this is why I find Ms. Brown's style so dull. Most romance novels are rubbish, in my humble opinion. Ms. Brown is trying to break away from romance novels. Let's hope her writing style improves."
5,Worked like a charm,"After seeing a Youtube video on how to install a power outlet in a wall in an older home, I took a chance and bought this. It worked just like the video showed, and I successfully ran electrical wire up the wall, into the attic. I now have a brand new outlet behind my freshly mounted flat screen TV. So great to do it yourself. I saved a good $200 or more on having someone do it for me (and that is a conservative estimate)."
1,Not so good,"The book appeared to be random ideas about different issues published under a ""unifying"" title. I was planning to finish the book but decided not continue after the author claimed that Eccles ii. 10 said something about reading the Bible from beginning to end to find that those who trusted God were never confounded. While this statement is true, Eccles ii. 10 is about something completely different."
1,Chinese subtitles = BOOTLEG,"The #1 way to spot illegal bootleg DVDs is to check for Chinese subtitles. This has them. The video and audio were probably captured from either VHS or live broadcast, thus ensuring horrible recording quality, and I wouldn't count on the subtitles as having been translated accurately either. Just wait for Hasbro/Takara to give us the real thing."
4,"Strong, fits well, slightly distorted image","Even though this is the style for earlier years, I bought it for my 2006 TJ since it was metal, rather than the plastic mirrors I've been breaking on the trail, or by bumping with my shoulder in the garage. And it is indeed much tougher than the plastic junk.However, the mirror is not ""optically pure"" in that it has some waves in it so cars look a little ""wrong"" at times, but that doesn't bother me nearly as much as breaking the whole thing off like on the others..."
3,Singularity,"This book wasn't the best chunk of writing i've ever read but it was somewhat suspenceful and interesting. There are these two twin brothers that fight all the time and thier uncle dies. They go to his house to start claiming stuff and find the keys to a play house. After a while they figure out that there is a stone under it that makes time go faster for anything that stands on it and theres an event horizon to a blzck whole some where in space..in the sink. The slightly fatter and out of shape twin goes in the playhouse for a year, overnight because he's 1.tired of being twins and 2.is tired of his brother being so much more ""perfect"". (...)If you like science/science fiction theories and fueding brothers this is a book for you."
1,Spectacularly... disapointing,"Mabye I'm biased because this is a manditory school reading book, but I really hated it. This book is about 2 twins, Harry and Barry Krasner, who go off to live at their uncle's old house for a while. Barry is a control freak who has almost absolute power over Harry, and always makes him feel stupid, and Harry in the beginning is a wuss but becomes psychotic along the way. This book is definently not worth buying, but if you really want to, use the library so you can at least give back the book."
3,Oh well,"I enjoyed listenig to this and was floating the flrst time I listed, that was-until I heard ""Some Humans Ain't Human"" and it just kinda fell apart for me there. Bummer. It's now just OK, rather than the jewel I originally thought it might be. The lyrics are a real drag and the cliché political statments made me cringe. How to ruin an otherwise good collection of songs."
1,Not on a G5,If you want these speakers for the g5. Time to move on. It is a completely different speaker jack. I'm returning them.
2,"Broken, packaged horribly","The product is cute, but it was packaged in a flimsy cardboard box with a tiny piece of deflated bubble wrap between the two parts. Needless to say, the salt shaker broke in half. I fixed it with super glue cause I figured it was just too much of a pain to send back. Also, be sure to pour the salt or pepper into your hand and not directly onto you food, as the holes are way too big."
4,Strange Brew of Stories,"Who put these stories together, anyway? They were like two different books.I bought this for Miss Jarrett's story because I like her real books alot, and I'd heard it was good. It was good entertainment, and lots of funny conversations between the hero and the heroine. I liked them both, and I liked this story. It's why I'm giving four stars.I thought the others would be lite and funny stories in England at the same time. Nope. Instead they were dark and depressing, with no humor. They are both put in medieval times, in Scotland and Wales.The first writer lost me when she had the hero try to strangel heroine. I don't care if he thought she was in disguise, abusing women is NOT ACCEPTABLE. The other story was okay, just average."
2,The contents are uninspiring and the craft dull,"This book of poetry contains too much of the same complaint and does not lift our spirits. Generally I enjoy ""ethnic poetry,"" but not this. This author whom I've never read before, seems to be faking sincerity in order to join in the chorus. Felix Stefanile, Daniela Gioseffi and Diane DiPrima do a much better job on these themes. They have the craft to lift our spirits and tell their stories, too. Check them out on Amazon.com. They are better writers from the Italian American culture. Much finer crafters of poetic art. I wanted to like this book, but couldn't. Too stale and dull."
2,not all that impressive,"This is my first exposure to Masekela's music, and it was a huge letdown.""The Lasting Impressions of Ooga Booga,"" sounds very pop and very loungey. Perhaps at the time it sounded much more progressive than it does now, but that doesn't evade the fact that nowadays it sounds fairly tired.And it's absolutely painful to hear Masekela obviously missing notes on the trumpet and playing, well, not to be too blunt, very poorly indeed. His tone is blaring and his pitch is none too sure. And in spite of the alleged ""African"" nature of the record, I hear a ton of western influences, not least John Coltrane and Miles Davis compositionally.Overall, I was somewhat less than impressed with this, and I can't recommend it. Perhaps Masekela's other records are better, but based on this one I would have to say you'd have to prove it to me first before I plunked down any more money."
4,Love this toy!,"My daughter loves watching Blue so when I gave her this life-like version of him for her birthday she nearly passed out with excitement. He's very soft and when you squeeze his hand he speaks very clearly with Blue's voice. I only wish his middle weren't so hard, but I don't suppose there's anyway to avoid this and have him be a talking doll."
5,Love this series,I like the Emily books because she is a writer and she's not as bubbly as Anne of Green Gables. The books are darker than the Anne series.
3,Dead on Site,This Was OK but disappointing for Tiffany Shepis fans for she only has a very small role at the beginning of the film. BOOOO!
3,Tiffany Shepis and Web-Cams equal murders.,"Featuring: Tiffany Shepis.So there this web*cam set-up in a house that hosted a mass murder.Nothing out of the ordinary happens, Well if youre planning a re-enacting the murders from past and Don't mind dying yourself.The house looked familiar maybe because its amazing,Lots of windows and a unbelievable pool,I think it was used for a Eric Roberts film from Maxim Media.Great cast besides Shepis,Who leaves a little early,There is Jose Rosete who has made some movies, Alot of scary movies.Okay,Here is the score card- Beautiful people,wild flash backs, lots of knife wounds."
5,Worth the read,Wonderful reading loved every bit.It is a very special way of learning more about the Old Testiment & the Kings of that time.
5,Get them both,"If you look at the contents, Three Women and Hidden Man seem similar, and the question is, do I buy both? If you're an Ornette fan, yes. If not, it's a tough call. Overall, Hidden Man has a more bottom-heavy, accessible sound. Three Women can seem a little cool. However, if you don't buy Three Women, you miss out on one cut not on Hidden Man, and that is the meltingly beautiful ""Don't You Know by Now?""."
5,One of My Favorite Books from Childhood,"""Beautiful Joe"" is a wonderful story. It was given to me in the late 50's when I was about 10 years old, and I think I read it three times. It's always amazed me that so few others know of it. But it is a beautiful and enriching story especially suitable for a 9-12 year old child who loves dogs. It is very sad (and distrubing) in the beginning, however, so I would never recommend it for a young child."
5,It is responsible for my love of books.,"I am 60 years old..I received this book on my 10th birthday. I had never really read anything before and I began this book out of boredom.50 years later...I am astounded to find out it is still in print!! Ive never forgotten the book, or Joe. It is the foundation for my love...my voracious need to read.Thank you Amazon, for having it in print and available. Now, not only my grandchildren..but my Great Granddaughter will have the chance to meet Joe and the family who nursed him back to health with love.Childrens book? maybe...but a book for ALL ages. I am eager to re-read over and over again this loving tender book. Thank you again."
5,Because of Winn-Dixie,"My husband and I had missed the first part of this movie when it was shown recently, but in viewing what we did, I decided immediately it was one we needed in our movie library for our grandchildren's visits. It is definitely ""family entertainment"" and a fun movie!"
2,TO SAD.......,"Because Of Winn - Dixieis a little toooooo sad.In some parts I did cry........but it has a good plot.The olny thig that i put two stares is that It was toooooo sad........The acting is wonderful,the plot is cute,Winn - Dixie is cute(a little bit)but it was tooooooooooooo sad......,WAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!I'M CRYING!!!!!"
1,Try justifying the $20 pricetag,"Why oh why is this DVD $20 ? It's the same at WalMart, Target, etc. This is a single disc release with Full and Widescreen versions crammed together. This should really be in the $14.99 or less range. Why is Fox pricing this so high everywhere when other studios release new family DVD's around $15? You can buy brand-new 2-disc special editions with lots more hi-quality content for the same money."
2,"If you're going to review something, you should watch it to have an opinion","This movie was not that awful, though I would never choose to see it again. The story is about how individuals in a small town deal with loneliness. I will agree with what other reviewers have said about the dog. A lot of really heart-warming and good moments happen in this movie, but I was turned off by the way that they claimed that it was because of the influence of the girl's ""friendly"" dog, when really it was about a girl being a good neighbor. Hollywood also decided to throw in a lot of their inane ""slapstick"" moments which you've seen in every other movie with a dog in it, such as the dog's head-butting of the preacher's crotch."
3,Just Because,"Because of Winn-Dixie (2005) *** |C--106 min.| D: Wayne Wang. Jeff Daniels, Cicely Tyson, Dave Matthews, Eva Marie Saint, AnnaSophia Robb. PGI have to admit, I don't usually like animal movies at all, but this was a pleasant exception. It's a sweet, heart-felt little story in the style of Pollyanna about a girl who finds a stray dog and through her adventures with the dog changes the hearts of many people. It's got a good story to tell and though it could be better, there isn't much else they could have done with it. Eva Marie Saint is the high point of the movie. It will entertain kids and adults alike, but the more cynical of people will find the film a little bit preachy, which it definitely is, but more optimistic people will not mind. It's very predictable, but ultimately it's a good movie with a nice little bleeding heart."
5,my new favorite,"I just rented this movie yesterday and was blown away. I adored the book and was pleasantly surprised the movie was as good. I am surprised it wasn't a bit hit in theatres. The writing, acting, and scenery were all terrific. Winn Dixie is one of the cutest dogs I have ever seen and his owner ""Opal"" one of the cutest kids ever. This is a wonderful film for the whole family. No cursing, violence, or sex. I highly recommend this film which is all about loving our neighbors and respecting each other's differences."
3,Good movie! Bad tech!!!!!,"Yesterday I saw Winn-Dixie and I liked the plot, but what was going on with the boom microphones? When the police came to Gertrude's Pets, I could see the mics BIG TIME!!!!!!!!!!!! If they make a sequal, they should get a new boom operator!!!"
3,Excellent second wallet,"This wallet is fine, the design excellent, fashionable. The covered money clip on the outside with the `pressing against the main body of the wallet' design gives it a very good grip on the bills held here. The grip is so strong I have torn bills when I attempt to remove them quickly. Best way to remove bills is all at once, then separate bills when outside of the clip. Maximum number of bills to hold comfortably is 10-15 folded. The inside is well designed and holds a few cards well. A plus is the thinness of the wallet - it is almost invisible in any pocket, preferably front or jacket. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen. Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you). As a gift for any guy - romantic or non-romantic."
4,Vidalia Onion Creations by Prissy - Sweet Onion Relish (8 Ounce) by igourmet.com Review,"This was really good on brauts, hot dogs, and burgers. However, my sister added it to cream cheese and added a bit of dill and garlic and made the BEST dip!!! Y'all should try this. It's really good."
5,Great cage!,Cages like this sell for so much more at petsmart and petco and this quality is amazing. I've had this cage for months and have had no problems. All the toys inside are cute. Its just great all around. My bird LOVES the mirror with the beads. Amazing purchase.
4,Details of movie theater trade most intriguing,"Thompson's tale of fraud, murder, and adultery isunremarkable (compared to Thompson's other works) except in it's presentation of the politics of a small town. Most of all, the presentation of Joe Wilmer's job as an owner of a first-run movie theater and his dealings with the union is fascinating. This is a novel that could have only been written by Jim Thompson."
1,Wrong order Spanish speaking dvd,This was unbelievable they sent me a Spanish DVD. There was no indication warning me that this was a Spanish DVD when I ordered it. When it arrived at my house I was really surprised and very disappointed. Anyway I donated it to the local goodwill and hopefully some Spanish speaking individual has found some good use for it.
2,Just scratching to be seen,"Probably the best Monogram film Lugosi was in with an interesting double life plot, and he's quite a ruthless character and genuine in trying to make this film better than average. Supporting cast has some recognizable regulars from other Monogram low budget productions, with the addition of Tom Neal, who's talent stood out. I'm giving this title a low rating not for the movie but for the terrible print. Much of the print has lines ""dancing"" across the middle of the picture...very distracting! A shame because the audio is fine, as is the remainder of the image. I hate to bad-mouth a distributor interested in selling Lugosi, but why bother with a print like this? This was selling at a dollar store, and was barely worth even that much.Oh, and I give the rest of the film about two and a half stars because it holds the viewers interest and is fairly entertaining."
1,Sigh. Painfully Bad Independent Film,"Matthew Montgomery and Windham Beacham are the only two capable actors in this cringe-inducing, badly written film. There was an interesting film somewhere in the depths of this mess, but it was buried beneath unbearable dialogue and generally unbearable acting. Moreover, minimum professional film making demands that one keep the boom mic out of the frame. You can see it bobbing in an out of the top of the frame at the beginning of the film: 4:18 - 4:25. Just because an independent film-maker is working on the cheap doesn't mean a film can't be carefully made. Why didn't Rob Williams' co-producers sit him down and force him to edit his script? Why didn't someone tell him it would be better to cut badly acted dialogue by peripheral characters rather than leave it in the film. Why didn't someone tell him that some attempt at a consistent tone helps a movie achieve the goal of telling a story. In the meantime, save your money."
3,Obscure and intriguing,"This is the first book I've read by Mindell and maybe I need to become more familiar with his world - his writing is rather obscure - a bit like the description of alchemy - explaining the obscure by the more obscure. Perhaps it is because I'm African that many of the explanations do not strike a chord or produce an ""aha"" experience, but more often a ""huh?"". HOwever, I'm just beginning on this journey with Mindell and perhaps as I work more and more with his very interesting practical section on working with the dreambody I will begin to understand. Definately a book worth reading - it will bring a new dimension to your relationship with your body, emotions & lifepath"
1,Pass on it.,"This ill-conceived and poorly written compilation of superstition and combined myth and fairy tale has nothing of redeeming value except for the study of possible ancient beliefs. I write ""possible"" as there are no corroborating texts with which to gauge whether or not described customs were in fact part of the described culture or simply ""literary license"" by the author. Without this, nothing credible exists within the text."
4,An interesting farce,"Shaw calls this short play a ""bravura"" piece, meaning that it was composed for a particular actress as a vehicle for her to display her acting skills. It is actually a farce - a play that is light in tone, in which the plot depends upon situation rather than character; a ridiculous unrealistic sham; a mockery. Shaw introduces the historical Catherine as a rather silly German ruler of Russia, who dislikes everything associated with being a ruler, who likes sexual liaisons. She meets an English captain who is, as Shaw generally portrays Englishmen, a foolish undereducated snob, for Shaw (1856-1950), who was brilliant, was born an Irishman. Shaw tells us that the actress for whom he wrote the play performed excellently. We readers will find the play funny, although at times, like the Englishman, silly, but still worth reading for its humor."
1,unsientific debunked treatment,"I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist. So-called ""Reparative therapy"" has been completely debunked, and the American Psychological Association has come out with a statement to that effect. A large number of people who have been harmed by this misguided unscientific practice, and there is an increased suicide rate among it's survivors. To use these methods is to risk harm to your clients and to open yourself up to litigation for malpractice, for which your clients will have a solid case."
1,Reparative Therapy is NOT Therapy,Reparative Therapy is not accepted by any therapist association anywhere. It has been thoroughly debunked. There is no scientific evidence to support it. What there is wide evidence on is the high suicide rate amongst LGBT teens who are subjected to being treated as they are not normal and need to change something that is impossible to change. This book is not clinical and actually dangerous.
4,Don' t let reviewers scare you away!,"Evidently some reviewers are writing without having read the book. Dr. Nicolosi does NOT assert that recovery from homosexuality is impossible, but that one should go through therapy anyway, as another reviewer asserts. Even a reading of the book's title should have made this obvious(!). This flagrant misrepresentation of Dr. Nicolosi's work should serve as a caution to those trying to find information on this sensative subject. Emotions run so high that one hardly dares trust any of the reviews --SO-- get the book and read it for yourself. If you've come this far seeking answers, you owe it to yourself not to be detered by the venomous rhetoric of those so uncomfortable with their own sexuality that that they cannot stand the existence of differing points of view, particularly when backed by science, experience, and success, as are Dr. Nicolosi's."
5,Glad I read this before my vacation,"I heard about this book from a Miami radio show interview just before a vacation. Fortunately! I usually gain weight during a trip and come home feeling more stressed than before I left. But this time was different. If this sounds like you, you'll appreciate thes ideas as I do. Thanks."
1,Please tell me I didn't really watch this.,"It's bad, bad, bad. The plot is dumb, the special effects are awful.My prayer is that the makers of this nausea-fest were only kidding, but it's never quite bad enough to make me laugh -- just turn away.Add a point to this review if you suspect that I'm not sophisticated enough to get some fabulous inside joke that makes Rodentz high camp.With all due respect, I don't think so. To each his own."
5,Take a stand of your own,"An eye-opener and in view of recent events in the UK, what Annie Jacobsen has to say is fair warning to all air travellers, despite the dismissive accounts of some readers (who, I feel, could well be trying to defend their own lack of common sense).It may be politically incorrect to stigmatise a cast or creed, but in view of the radical Islamic jehadists stance against the west and what they have already done, it seems only common sense to avoid any flights that might carry such personages.Personally, I won't take the risk in future and will be eyeing my fellow passengers very carefully. If I suspect anything might be wrong, I'll ask to be put on another flight. Maybe, if others do the same, the Airlines might begin to do something to protect their passengers, such as recommending ""some"" people fly Arab Airways instead.Thank you for your courage and writing this book Annie. It's a book that everyone should read."
3,Making It To Graduation,"Wayne Morris, Ronald Reagan, and Eddie Albert star as three senior cadets in their final year at the Virginia Military Academy. The question that hangs over them is whether they will graduate, since they have a talent for getting themselves into trouble. Morris drags Reagan into many of his schemes, including chasing girls, while Albert has caught his girl, marrying her (which is against the rules). To top it off, she's also pregnant. The cast is up for the various shenanigans, playing their parts with a lot of energy. Albert is particularly memorable as the cadet trying to concentrate on graduating while his personal life is upside down. The girls are played by Priscilla Lane, Jane Bryan, and Jane Wyman. Only Wyman really makes an impression. It's fun to see life in the Academy and to see Reagan and Wyman before they were big stars. Some of the humour wears thin and there are certain lapses in logic, but everyone is so likeable it's easy to overlook."
2,Disappointing compared to the first one,We love Sandra Bullock but compared to the first Miss Congeniality this movie is way below average. It is by far not as funny and refreshing as the first one was. You might like it if you either don't know the first one or are able to set your expectations way lower.
4,4.75...really cute movie!!,"Move over CIA, Gracie Hart is on the case, along with her arch-enemy sidekick, Sam Fuller. What starts off as a true hate-hate relationship between these two, ends up a like-like freindship. Watch as these two, along with a cast of colorful characters fights their way through the streets of Las Vegas to find Miss America and the pagents MC!! Let the fists fly, and some insults fly, in true Ms. Congeniality style, for some great fun!! If you loved Miss Congeniality 1, you are going to love MC2!!"
3,"Funny, but not as great as the first","While being a big fan of the first movie, I was fairly excited to see the second. After I saw it, I thought it was OK. Not as clever and original as the first, but still very entertaining. The second had a lot more laughs, slapstick, and funny bits...however I'd say it lacked in plot. EVERYTHING was predictable, and you knew what would happen the moment the movie started--not like in the first movie, which was more inventive and unpredictable to a certain degree.However I will say most of this movie was hilarious, even if it lacked in other things. I definitely recommend seeing it, as it will probably be the funniest movie of the year. If you're in the mood to see a very funny, laugh a minute-ride, you should definitely check it out in the theater! But don't get your hopes up for this being better than the first."
4,Entertaining!,This movie was entertaining! As I stated in my review on the other review this movie is one of those rare PG-13 that the whole family can enjoy! This movie was very nescarry but it's a great buy to a great movie. Just don't except too much from this movie on account it's no where as near as good as the first one.
2,Sandy's biggest letdown.,"Miss Congeniality 2- Armed and Fabulous is a terrible, unoriginal little sequel. No wonder it didn't make a lot at the box office, I love Bullock, she is one of my favorite movie stars but this film was just hideous. The only reason I didn't give this movie one star is because the scene with the Dolly Parton was hilarious, practically the only funny scene in the sequel. And what's so great about Regina King? She doesn't seem like a break-out star to me, she's nothing to rave about. Avoid this movie, you will be happy you did."
1,Complete garbage,"I cannot believe there actually are positive reviews. This movie is horribly uninspired, unfunny and even ugly. I wasn't expecting ""Schindler's List"", but this was so bad I couldn't stand to watch all of it.Here is an example of a ""funny"" scene from the movie: Sandra Bullock learns that a Dolly Parton impersonator might be involved in the crime. Accidentally, while in a hotel lobby in Las Vegas, Sandra Bullock spots her, chases and finally apprehends her with a jump. And then - suprise !!! To FBI's embarrasment this turns out to be the _real_ Dolly Parton. Unbelievably funny, isn't it?The other equally ""good"" parts are when Sandra Bullock's black female FBI partner hits her in the face, or kicks her in the back without any provocation. I suppose later in the movie they become best friends, but I didn't get that far myself.If you like jokes like these, by all means buy this movie."
1,"smelled bad, tasted bad, very expensive",xmas gift for my son. everyone in the room said it smelled awful when he opened the bag. he had enjoyed venison jerky in the past-he hated this stuff!
1,BAD!!!,This jerky is very very bad. Its so salty that u can't actually taste the jerky. The meat seems to be very rubbery with no taste whatsoever.
3,Nice try at balance,"Yet another attempt to bring an easy solution to a difficult problem that has no easy solution. Nice try, and at least it is fairly even-handed."
5,lo mejor de la anti-musica,"Este cd lo consegui por pura suerte, gracias a mi pana Carlos Mattera quien me lo cambio por un cd de King Crimson, solo les puedo decir que es bien dificil de conseguir casi cualquier cosa de este grupo, un sonido totalmente experimental y psicodelico, pero pesado, no comas cuento, si te la quieres hechar de ke sabes de musica este es el cd."
5,"Great look, great value","I am crazy about these glasses -- I love how each one is individual, and the cobalt is a good color. They are somewhat heavy, but probably not as much as my Mexican glassware which I also really like. These glasses look expensively handblown, as each one is slightly different. The price is great for what you get."
5,Murano Cobalt Blue glasses,"GORGEOUS glasses! Great quality, suitable for every day AND formal use. Nice price. Super product all around."
5,A neccesary resource for homeschooling!,"I purchased this book after discovering another book by the same author, titled: ""A Family Guide to the Biblical Holidays."" This book was such an inspiration to me and helped me to re-evaluate my curriculum choices. For fans of Charlotte Mason and Ruth Beechick, this is a must read! For everyone else considering homeschooling, this book will introduce you to a God-centered method of educating your children, while ensuring you have guidelines to meet state educational standards at the same time."
3,Disappointed,"The description indicates that this lamp can take a 100 watt bulb, however the light socket indicates not to use over 60 watts or risk fire hazard. Also--the finial at the top is noticeably crooked. I called the vendor who says they will send me a new one; we will see. I am keeping it--basically because it is too much of a hassle to send back and I don't hate it. It is not worth the price however--I would value this as under $50."
2,Not what is Advertised.,I ordered this cd because I purchased the album about twenty five years ago and I only really liked the title track by Frida. This cd is not Frida and contains three songs by some rock band that sounds as generic as other bands with singers who seem to be having their voices change. I probably could like this if I was a sixteen year old girl...but that I am not. This was a bad purchase because of false advertising.
4,Well designed hamster cage,This is a newer version of a cage I had before. The new design is very well thought out. There are lots of ways to keep the critter entertained and it is much easier to keep clean. The only negative is the water bottle is very tight and I always feel like I am going to break something when I get it out.
2,"Cheap parts, breaks easily","I bought this cage, cause it was a 2 level cage, and it looked fun for my 2 dwarf hammies.Pros: My hammies LOVED this cage, they liked the slide, jumping off of it, and running up and down.They really liked the pet viewing pod, which they turned into their nest. Super cozy.With them in their nest, the pod was easy to detach for cleaning time.With 2 levels, they had a lot of room, and they liked the set-up.Cons: The wheel was the worst part. They would always turn it into a nest, and then make a huge mess, running around in it.Everything is made out of the cheapest inflexible plastic.I broke a part cleaning it within one week. Hard to clean, lots of parts.One hammie really liked chewing the neon green paint on the bars.The wheel is NOISY and i felt it was too big for the dwarf hamster, they had a hard time turning it fast enough.We had this cage for 3 months, and now its back to their old cage."
1,WOULDN'T KNOW,"After ordering and waiting for the product to arrive, the children were disappointed it took so long. Then to only to receive an email from the seller that our product was not going to be shipped since they couldn't afford to ship it? That is the idea of paying shipping and handling right? So through email I tell the seller how disappointed the children are and how I paid enough for the item there was no reason for it to have not been shipped. The seller was nasty and unprofessional. Told me, ""Look lady, go to petsmart and get it."" and other nasty things. I was very angry and disturbed by the treatment of the seller, as well as the unprofessionalism of the entire event. I have never had such a bad experience purchasing something online as I did in this case."
3,Pretty good for mice,"We bought this for my daughter to connect to another cage for her 3 mice. It is really fun-looking and colorful. One down side is that our mice do not seem to enjoy spinning the wheel at all; I think it takes more effort to spin than the more standard wheel in their other cage, that they use all the time. They do go in the rooftop wheel to eat if we put a treat in. Also, after only 2 weeks, part of the cage's plastic has cracked; this happened at the connection point we are using to attach it to the other cage--maybe we have been handling it too roughly. We were able to mend it with duct tape, but still, you'd expect the plastic to hold up a little better. The mice love the little petting zone and often bring bedding up there to snuggle in. They also adore the ramp for nesting under (they do go up and down it, too, but not a ton since they aren't using the wheel)."
1,Don't buy it!!!,My hamster only had a few days in this cage before her paw got caught in the wheel. She is at the vet's office and we are awaiting to hear the results.Believe the reviews! Do not buy this cage!
2,Fine if you like cleaning up the poo...,"Bought this cage for our daughter's first hamsters. For the most part it's working out okay, except for one very important thing: her hamsters like to spend most of their time in the wheel. Which means, yes, they do lots of pooping up there. Then they get the wheel spinning, and you can imagine the rest... food and poo everywhere outside the cage. Very messy! We're looking at replacing the wheel with some other accessory if possible. Bottom line, would we buy it again? Nope."
1,BOO,"okay, so I bought this cage with my two hamsters pip and squeak, and was happy with it for like the first few months, even though cleaning it is annoying. the problems came with the wheel which creeks something horrible when the hamsters run, but i fixed that by spraking it with pam. theh the hamster escaped, three times and i have no idea how, i assume they maneuvered themselves between the bars, especially at the top, and then they climbed down a towel that was under the cage to keep the table clean. they do tend to den in the wheel when its blocked or otherwise they just throw bedding and seeds in it which rattles worse than the squeaking when they decide to run. oh and the wheel has spacing in it that allows the built up contents to be ejected out when the hamsters run so prepare your vacuum cleaner, and a hamster escape routine! crap cage!"
2,Super Pet CritterTrail Extreme Challenge habitat,"I choose this rating as the wheel at the top is useless. Even with vegetable oil to lube it, it won't turn smoothly. The two halves that form the wheel are not flush either and have large gaps. How is a hamster supposed to run on that? Disappointed in the manufacturing of this product. Not up to par."
4,Hamster Cage,"We received this very quickly. This cage is very cool, but kind of hard to clean. The wheel seems to confuse the hamster, she would sleep in it and take food up there. We ended up adding a super silent slide inside the cage and she runs on that. We don't really like the water bottle, wish it had a regular drinking end, but it doesn't leak, which is so nice. The bottle is kind of hard to fill up. We tried to talk our son into a regular cage, because they are easier to clean, but he had to have the 'cool"" one. It is very nice looking, just wish it was easier to clean, especially the wheel."
5,Great Cage,"This cage is great! The size is perfect, and my gerbils love it. The only downsized is there is no lock on the front door, one of my gerbils taught herself how to open it! :)Critter Trail is a very recommendable brand. Get One."
3,Lots to do!,"Our Fribble likes his new home. The only thing I would say negative is that the wheel on top is not made well. It doesn't move easily. But the slide, and the tube is great. Good sized cage, not too small and we can add on as he gets bigger."
2,Disappointing purchase,"I purchased this hamster cage, on line, for my teddy bear hamster. It looked like a lot of fun, especially the wheel part. Fortunately, I got a really good deal on it because it wasn't as cool as it looked. The wheel doesn't really move. I have tried to sand down the edges, thinking that would help it move more freely, and I have greased up the bottom part (with butter) so that it would rotate around. But nothing has seemed to work. Also, my hamster doesn't seem interested in going up there at all. He does enjoy climing up the spiral ramp, but that's it. I am pretty disappointed in the cage as a whole."
2,What a mess,"This started as a cool new home for my son's first pet, but our sirian started nesting in the wheel the first night. No matter how many times I emptied the bedding, she went right back to storing food and bedding in the wheel. Every time she went for a run, shavings, seeds, and poop went everywhere! I swapped her out fof the basic Critter Trail without the wheel on top, but that one has a very small wheel and it is not big enough for our sirian. Now I have to buy more stuff... sigh."
2,Lookout!,"Have had this for a few months now. Very Cute and the hamster loves it. Problem is that it is pretty fragile, a few broken parts. Found that it is too Fragile for a 10 year-old to take apart and put together to clean, and put back together. If you are buying this for a small child, look out because you'll be cleaning it!!!!"
1,Believe the reviews and skip this cage,"We ended up with this particular cage because it was the only one in stock when we got our hamsters. Everything is fine except the wheel as mentioned by everyone else. Our hamsters didn't nest in the wheel but did occasionally eat up there and the poop and food particles fly everywhere when they go for a run. The track beneath the wheel doesn't really do much as the mess sprays out and covers about a 2ft radius around the cage. So I thought I would just get another metal type wheel to put in the cage and cap off or add a different accessory where the crazy wheel was. So I spent another $20 on all of that. However, none of crittertrail's accessories fit in the hole and now I am stuck with the mess forever. Believe the reviews and get a different cage."
2,Looks neat but didn't work for our Robos,"We got this for our Robo hamsters but had to return it a few days later because the veritcal tube on the side did not fit flush into the cage (no matter how I tried) and there were spaces left on the side that the robos (who can fit through any space the size of a nickle) could wriggle through. The harder I tried to fit the pieces together the more risk I ran of cracking the cheap plastic. Then every time you clean the cage you have to take it apart, and since these are my son's pets I wanted him to be able to clean it easily. There's very little space inside the cage for other accessories, and I didn't like having poop flung hither and yon every time a hamster ran in the wheel at the top. We went to using an aquarium style cage for our robos, which is much easier to clean, more spacious, and I don't worry about the hamsters escaping."
1,Two weeks and then in trash,"At first I didn't understand what the big deal was with cleaning the cage. Then after a few weeks of trying to take it apart, Put it back together agian and get the smell out of it....I understand why everyone is giving bad reviews. The wheel kept my husband awake at night because of the sound. The hamsters hung out most time in the wheel, Which is the most hardest to clean.Get a large plastic storage tote ( one with high walls) from Walmart or Target, Leave the lid off and put it up high enough other animals cant get it. The perfect cage. Easy to clean easy to see through."
2,Shoddy cage,"After cleaning this cage once a week for a month, the plastic parts wouldn't fit together properly anymore and the whole cage began falling apart. I was really unhappy given how much the cage was (about $35 at the time) that it didn't hold up at all. While the wheel at the top looks cool, it was one of the first parts to have to be removed because the need for constant cleaning wore it down. Might be good as a supplementary home for your critters, but not a primary residence."
5,a wonderful book,"a very informative book, and helpful for those just beginning to explore Santeria. Migene gives information about Orishas other than the main 7 African Powers. The information given about each orisha is: syncretism, cosmic force, representation, attributes, archtype, paths, initiation, and a legend. Highly recommended"
4,Not bad,"A decent basic primer, the controversy around the author's initiations notwithstanding. It's a decent introduction for the beginner. Worth the money."
2,"I already got, but not that great","i got my condition-zero on miRC and the game wasn't all that great. i only played the ritual missions and it sucked! not even good, the realism sucks and the fun was boring. i say this is the worst counter strike sequel ever made. if you want the game just download a program called miRC and download it for 1.9gb and save your money folks, its not the worth it. try call of duty or something. sorry for ruining your hopes"
1,Could have been OK,"I didn't really play this game much. It runs WAY too fast. I found it hard to even get the baddies in my sights - it is more like playing a fancy version of pong. This is nowhere near a simulation. IMO, Tactical Ops - Assault On Terror, circa ~2000, was a far better game in every way, and had adjustable game speed. To each their own."
4,Beginners review,"This was actually one of the very first shooter games I ever played. Also, one of the first desktop computer games i ever played. It's a lot of fun, of course, once you get the hang of using the keyboard controls. The single player mode really helps you to play online. Unlike my other games i've played on line where you feel like you're awesome beating up the computer and then you go online and get massacred. Overall a fun game if you like shooters. I recommend it."
2,For online practice only,"This is a good game for practicing (or beginning) online CounterStrike, if you are into that. You really can't call this a simulation by any means as the game play is frantic, with the your ""bot"" enemies jumping all over the place (too much caffeine I guess) You have to ""buy"" weapons and ammo at the start of each level or mission, which is a real pain as you only get a few seconds to do this. And speaking of time, you are on a timer to complete the missions, so no thinking at all here, just ""run and gun"". If you are looking for a simulation, go get Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield instead, its a far superior game."
4,Take a deeper look,"I have read a few reviews, and they are almost right. After installing Condition Zero, I clicked on the icon and proceded to play a regular game of counter strike, with mild upgrades, against bots whom are suprisingly realistic. This was cool but I felt ripped off at the same time. Then I clicked on the Counter Strike deleted scenes icon that setup had placed on my desktop and found an entirely different game. This game had all new terains, weapons, models, and layout (plays kind of like half life)Evidentally the Deleted scenes are what was actually being advertised. After finding this, I no longer felt ripped off, and am contently looking forward to a new T vs CT conflict. So if you do buy this game, go ahead and play the original with the bots, it is still fun (and seems a little more stable than the original) But if that gets old, remember that there is an entire new game named Counter Strike Deleted Scenes (a stupid and misleading name) on your desktop."
5,WARNING! This product has some addictive side-effects.,"Notice how the only people giving this game bad reviews are those who already played CS or Half Life: Countert Strike, yet everyone else is giving this five star ratings? That's because this game flipping rocks, and the only ones who have a problem with it are those who played a similar version. If you get this game, and haven't played any of the other CS's, then your only complaint should be that it cuts hours away from your life. I highly recomend this game, with a six out of five star rating (if only that were possible)."
1,"Copy Protection So Severe, It Wont Even Install","According to their tech support, this game is not compatible with Microsoft's drivers - and he instructed me to take apart my PC, get the motherboard model, and install other IDE drivers instead.Yeah, right. What a waste of time and money."
4,Like It,"Already on his third I still can't believe he made that many albums because he is more known for collaborations then being solo. Anyways this is a great album with great collabs. My favorite are ""I Got Love"", ""I Pledge Allegiance"" and Ring The Alarm. The whole album is solid with great production and I like how it is relaxing with the beats and his voice and this album you can chill to. Recommend this to g funk fans because this is at its best right here."
2,Not to the Hype,I always have dug Nate Dogg but He never brings it solo.Nate Dogg is Like the Mark Jackson(New york Knicks Point Guard)of Rap.He has far more Assits than you know but when the Light is on Him He usually can't Bring it.&that's how I Hear Nate solo.when He Backs somebody up it's like that Cut is gonna Blow Up because Nate is there but when He has His chance it falls usually.Problem being too many hands in the Soup here.Nate gets Lost&Becomes a Outsider Looking in here.this Guy has Helped out Many but it's time He Scored instead of Being the Point Guard for so many others that Have Benifited off Him.
2,Not worth your money,"I admit Nate Dogg was involved with tons of number 1 hits, but the man just isn't made for a solo career. The beats are wack except the one with dre (Thats the 2 stars). And after listening 2 songs I was already anoyed by this mans voice. He is booooooring. Nuthing new on this album. I never bought the album, but downloaded it from the internet and still deleted it. People save your money and dont buy this album."
3,do not be so sharp! it's a sunny cd.,Discovering Incognito via this first album purchase wants me to buy them all. The jazz and soul rhythm sticks a smile on my face i even get opening the cd. GO FOR IT! pamela.
5,Life Saver Sorbets,I love them. All my friends like them after I give them one. It's hard to believe something that is sugarless can taste so good!!!!!!
5,A little book of Peace,"I really recommend any book written by this great man. This book truly gets to the essence of what praying is all about. I was touched by these prayers, reading them was like a peaceful meditation.Thank You Miguel...Paul"
1,Shocked With a Huge Crack,Do not buy this product! I have been using this crock pot for the last few years (about 5-10 times a year). I just went into the kitchen to check on my dinner and saw the huge crack that was running from the top edge of the liner all the way through to the bottom. I cannot believe that something so thick could crack so easily. I expected this product to last a lifetime and that was why I originally was willing to spend the money on it. I will not be making that mistake again.
1,Avoid this slow cooker,"I bought this cooker over a year ago. After 6 months the pot cracked. I ordered a replacement ceramic pot, and after 8 months of 'backordered', shipped, oops we didn't really ship it, its still on backorder, shipped - defective pot (not glazed), backordered, backordered, and finally a cancellation letter from Kitchenaid Customer Service, stating the product was no longer available!$90 blown for 6 months of use.Kitchenaid has the absolute worst customer service I can recall ever encountering."
1,"My crock cracked, too","Agree with all comments. 1) Overall, the crock pot seems to function well. I have the stainless pot and beware, the outside gets incredibly hot. I make sure to keep it away from everything on the counter when I am cooking something; 2) The lid does not seat properly with the crock. This hasn't caused much of a problem and may even be the way it's designed. I have never had the liquid boil away even if the pot is on high all day; 3) My crock cracked after a year of use. To those who have observed that KitchenAid should stand behind it's product and replace the crock no questions asked, I agree. They should also redesign the darn crock so it doesn't crack and provide a free replacement since this is a well-documented issue. Some writers are on their third replacement for cryin' out loud!! KitchenAid is a big corporation that has enjoyed a stellar reputation. Since Whirlpool took over, doesn't seem that they have the same commitment to quality."
1,Major Disappointment,"I bought this slow cooker for my wife, she makes the best crockpot meals and we needed a new crockpot, and thought we'd purchase this ""higher-end"" slow cooker. Well, our pot has cracked 3 times - that's right 3 times. One of the pots that KitchenAid sent us was so warped that it rocked like a seesaw, thankfully they replaced it. Each time we thought, maybe the pot was defective - well after this 3rd time, I want my money back. What a major disappointment, and we ruined 3 meals. We must have bad luck because a lot of you out there are not having problems. We do not put frozen meat in the pot and we do not cook on high. We sooo much wanted to love this thing. Oh well."
1,DO NOT BUY! DEFECTIVE!!!!,"i am a great fan of KitchenAid products: they tend to be really well made, they work well and look good. HOWEVER, the insert for their slow cooker is defective. Today was the third and last time that an insert has cracked in the middle of cooking. It's not as if the machine was cheap, either...the first time an insert cracked, I thought it was my fault, although I always handled it with kit gloves. From reading others' reviews, I realize that this is a huge problem that the company doesn't want to address. I called them and they sent a new insert THREE TIMES, but now I give up. I can't afford to have the thing catch on fire when I'm not at home. Very disappointed in this product."
1,Design flow in the pot,"The inner ceramic pot keeps cracking. I went through three of them before Kitchen Aide offered our money back. Alas, I didn't take them up on their offer because I was just too freaking tired of dealing with all the fuss over this cookware. I have better things to do. It's in the garage. I may use it again if I can find an inner pot that fits at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. The replacements they kept sending keep cracking around the bottom, in the same exact place everytime. Do not buy this pot. It's from China. You can get better for half the price."
2,More Cracked Pots,"I bought a Kitchen Aid Slow Cooker KSC700 mostly based on the recommendations in the Cook's Illustrated review. Despite some of the experiences from other customers, I ordered one anyway hoping Kitchen Aid had maybe address this problem. My first one cracked on the third time, the second on the first time, all within 20-45 mins of starting. As per the reviews, I was very careful not to put in anything that was too hot/cold. Kitchen Aid was happy to replace the crock liner the first time but the second time they denied this was a problem and rather begrudgingly will send another one. I was surprised at the poor quality of not only their product (we have many of their appliances), but their customer service. I will try the third crock but feel it can't be left alone for long because of the potential fire hazard."
1,Cracked!,Inner bowl cracked after just 6 uses. Totally disapointed. The inner bowl is as much a new crock! Funny that they deny the issue but are selling inner bowls. Hmmmm.
2,Lid does not seal completely; poor design and manufacturing,"I see I am the only 2 (or 3) star reviewer for the cooker. Here's the deal: if you are going to serve warmed swedish meatballs at a potluck this unit will work fine. However, If you want to cook an outstanding meal and seal in all the flavors, add just the right amount of moisture, etc... look elsewhere.Quite simply, either the pot or the lid (I'm almost positive it's the former) is warped, so there is not a complete seal. Apparently, the cheapy rubber hose that goes around the lid's edge is supposed to take care of this -- but it doesn't. There is a large gap and steam escapes freely. By a couple of hours into the cooking cycle, my entire apartment smells like a pot roast factory. Compare this design to that of the similary priced All-Clad slow cooker and you will see that it does not need to put a black garden hose around the glass lid because it fits properly.This is a subpar product. KitchenAid should be ashamed to put their name on it."
1,cracked crockpot,"even though I read other's reviews and knew the pot could crack, I knew this wouldn't happen to me. Ha! The first time I used it after about 20 min, I heard a pop. I wish I had listed to other reviews."
5,"addendum to the ""seductive"" review","To use this course for independent study, one really needs the corresponding series of teachers guides (Oxford Latin Course: Teacher's Book (part one, two, etc.) for comments, explanations, keys to exercises."
4,I love learning latin,I am happy with the Oxford Latin course because you learn the language through interesting stories as opposed to repetitive exercises that can sometimes be boring.
4,Pretty Good Text,"I use this book for may Elementary Latin 2 course. The professor teaches straight out of this workbook. I enjoy the cultural section of each chapter, as it gives a bit of history of Rome as it pertains to the latin vocabulary and concepts just learned in the section. The illustrations are terrible, but kind of funny because they are so bad. One has to assume that they are intentionally drawn badly."
4,"Well Done,","This book is good for someone that is wanting to learn alot about Indiana Railroads, and their historical value. If your into railroads, this is a must have coffee table book. Some small errors in it, but for a book of this scale, it is great, and very profesionally done."
4,Earlier RTF albums much better than later,"There certainly is a 'split camp' thing with Romantic Warrior being ""best of RTF"" or not. While I know there are exceptions, I'll generalize and say (seemingly so) that jazz enthusiasts who grew up listening to Chick through the Miles days lean towards the earlier work of RTF, while prog rock fans (long-time listeners of Yes, ELP, etc. - many of them new to RTF) put Warrior at the top of their list. I'm in Camp #1 - I consider Where Have I Known You Before as the purest and freshest that band has ever sounded, followed *very closely* by Hymn (love its raw energy, and Bill Connor's work). I thought they jumped the shark with Warrior - it sounds way too sterile and overproduced. While a technical triumph for sure, they still bulldoze their way through a lot of the music. Not their best, but still a gem - Sorceress is one of my all-time favorite tunes."
2,Diamond Tester Rating,Not too impressed with this as it can produce the effect that it's a real diamond when it's not without touching anything around the stone too.
3,Good Battery Tray!,Will work just fine for it's intended use. Could be made a little sturdier to offer a little more support for some expensive deep cycle batteries.
4,No Kidding,"I am the percussionist with Roger Drawdy and The Firestarters and I am glad that our reviewer from Chicago enjoyed our live show enough to purchase a CD. We try to keep our live shows exciting and fun and that energy is difficult to capture on a studio disk. But to be fair even the best recording of a band is going to move you less than being there. I am sorry to hear he didn't enjoy our original material as much as the traditional songs but I thought I would quote a portion of a recent review in City Beat Magazine by Mike Breen. ""Touched is an excellent showcase for the group's acoustic-based, groove-driven Celtic songs. Tight, fervent performance is key, but of special note is Drawdy's keen songwriting abilities, which capture the mystique of the genre beautifully."" We always hope people will enjoy our music but if you don't just return the CD to me and I'll refund your money.Sincerely,Robert PinkertonBodhran, Roger Drawdy and The Firestarters"
4,Spine tingling,"Must have been a very good book, read it almost straight thru, stopping only for lunch. The author has spun a marvelous tale out of minimal information, many years after it happened. Could Poon Lim ever eat fish again? A diagram of the raft and a better description might have helped the reader, at the start. It wasn't that complex, but somehow the author made it overly complex, with wells, ledges, and so forth. Otherwise a fine book."
5,faith of fathers,You need to read this series! It was extremely well written and the content was so revealing. You will not be sorry.
5,Wonderful,I really love the way she intertwines Bible fact with fiction. Kept going back to my Bible to check facts. Although this was non-fiction it gave me a better understanding of the kings which was very boring to me before. Could hardly put the book down.
4,"Boozy, gritty, Irish chanteuse","A friend of mine from Ireland gave me this cd. He said, ""She's an unapologetic, no-holds-barred pub singer who has been there, done that. You'll love it."" I did.Coughlan sings with weary emotion and dry Irish humor on this cd. The simple arrangements are totally hummable for days after you hear them. The songs make you feel like you're in a small, smoke filled pub with both you and Mary on your 4th pint singing the blues.When I need a psych-up song, I listen to the moaning horns and Mary telling me that it ""ain't nobody's business what I do."""
2,MARY MISSES THE MARK,"my only encounter with MARY COUGHLIN was a version of ELVIS COSTELLO'S ''BABY PLAYS AROUND' that i thought was pretty sensational,mind you,it is one of ELV'S best compositions and MARY did it proud.The problem with this set is the lack of songs of that quality.MARY has a smokey,bluesy seductive quite heavenly voice,that at times,reminds me of JUNE TABOR(another fine female artist) and that voice deserves better material than whats on offer here.Out of the 10 songs here the few worthy of note are DOUBLE CROSS,MEET ME WHERE THEY PLAY THE BLUES and the splendid MAMA JUST WANTS TO BARRELHOUSE ALL NIGHT LONG.Its a pity because with a voice like this ladys this could have been a true classic."
3,"Very pretty, but.","I recieved this kettle as a wedding gift about a week ago. I love its elegant appearance very much. However, this kettle makes only one tone whistle. I boiled water 10-20 times so far... I don't know it's worth $70 when it cannot make two-tone hohner harmonic whistle."
2,Quantrill's Raiders,Not very factural but most folks who don't know the true history would still enjoy it. Quantrill was caught and hung in Kentucky far from what the movie suggests.
5,The Original Recordings are the Best!,"The World Premiere of this work took place at Town Hall in New York City -- on Saturday, April 24, 1976. And this is the World Premiere Recording of that epic performance! This truly being the original recording (I do have a thing about those!), I like this one the very best of all. Indeed, it was this very recording from which clips were taken, and used in Dr. Carl Sagan's 13-part ""Cosmos"" TV Series. Here is one thing it reminds me of: seeing the landscape of a new world (such as Mars) for the very first time! I also have a thing about music that was used in that series; TV entertainment that truly comes only ""once in a blue moon"".This work was conducted by the composer, by the way -- who opened it from the marimba to set the tempo, so that everyone else could follow and join in at the appropriate times. Boy, talk about a nearly-impossible work to perform! -- too bad I'm only allowed to give it a paltry five stars! o:-)"
1,Disappointing,"After my disappointment with Seve Reich's recording called ""Drumming"" I looked forward to this CD to justify the money I spent on both CDs. No such luck. This one sounded so much like the other one that we had to check to be sure which one was on. If therer are 18 musicians playing this music, they must have a very strong union because the other 13 or more must have been in another room taking a prolonged break. We istened to the ""Music for 18 Musicians"" again by mistake, and then put it both CDs in a place where we would never do it again. My wife, two sons who are a freshman and a senior in college, and I enjoy music and have a wide range of tastes in music. None of us could tolerate either of Steve Reich's CDs, must less like it. Don't buy a Steve Reich CD without listening to it first."
3,Chewed to Freedom!!!,"Love both the two and three level cages! Great fun for hamsters and gerbils! Our gerbils, however, have chewed through both cages and finally chewed their way to freedom and out of the last cage. The wheel is chewed to bits and resembles sharks teeth and the tunnels have extra gaps chewed at the serrations. The gerbils are smart and finally chewed around the edges of the domed stoppers, until they fell out and left a hole for them to escape through. Although the cage is easy on the eye and can be cleaned quickly, I wouldn't recommend it as a permanent home for gerbils, unless you have three hours or so to hunt down escaped gerbils all over the house. Check everyday for holes, if you buy this for your gerbils or works great as an exercise pen instead!"
4,Does the job,"Neat looking cage. Can be difficult to assemble and disassemble at times. Only cage my hamster has never escaped from, and I've had it for almost a year. I'm very satisfied with this product."
2,A pain to clean,"This cage is a pain to clean and put together. If you getting this product for a child and expecting the child to be able to put it back together. Think again even I as an adult had problems with it. The water bottle sits too low, The top part of the petting zone gets stinky really quick. If you do end up getting a knocked up hamster from the pet store, they will most likely have the babies in the petting zone which makes it even harder to clean the cage and harder to peek in to check on the babies. The tab part for the petting zone breaks off easily and needs to be ducktaped down. You have the water bottle whole then theirs another whole with a plug type of end. Hamsters will chew on that very easily. If I had to buy another one all over again, I wouldn't."
3,Delicate Plastic,"My first order arrived already broken, the exchange with amazon was no big deal however. The plastic the cage is made of is very thin and breaks easily, so be careful when you assemble the cage or when your kids clean the cage. The layout of the cage is nice, our dwarf enjoys the crawling tubes. If only the plastic were more durable I would give it 5 stars but it is not, therefore only 3 stars."
1,This is terrible!,I have now for years hamsters and I personally find this cage terrible. It is in my opinion way to small and all plastic. Hamsters have good teeth and can get hurt badly if they bite the plastic and swallow tiny pieces. The wheel ist way to small as well. My cage is a wire with a plastic tray. It is 100 cm long and 55 cm wide and 45 high. It came with a stand on wheels.I also put wooden houses and ramps and a wheel in. It is well ventilated and my hamsters really like it. In those closed tubes feces and mildew can grow and affect the hamsters health badly.Just think about it when you get a cage........Would you like to be trapped in those tubes?
4,Great,This is an awesome cage except my hamster never used the red things on the sides.and the wheel it gives you squeaks squeaks all the time
1,Sent me wrong item,"There is no option for exchange. The item I ordered should have the 10oz long water bottle as the picture shown. I received the same cage, but it has the small water bottle hangs on the back of the cage. Don't like it."
4,Super pet critter trail 2 level habitat,"This is an adequate hamster cage for our needs.What we like: Fluffy loves the very top part, that is where he makes his bed and spends most of his time. You can attach a separate water bottle if you want. It is open for Fluffy to get exercise and easy for us to see him eating. The doors are secure to prevent escape.What we don't like: The placement of the water bottle included is not ideal, I don't think Fluffy could drink out of it, so we use a separate one. The plastic is too fragile for small children to help much with caring for Fluffy, the top lid cracked during assembly, but it is still useable. Fluffy likes close dark spaces, so he doesn't like that the cage is completely see-through. I put a small peice of cloth on top over the bed he makes and this keeps him happy."
4,I wish I'd looked here first!,"I bought this habitat at my local pet store for about fifty bucks. I wish I'd looked on Amazon first, because I'd have saved myself some money.That aside, my hamster and I love this habitat. It was really easy to put together (didn't even need instructions) and he has plenty of room to run around and nest. One of my cats knocked it over and broke it pretty badly, though. But hey, what can you do? I just taped it back together and still got a few months use out of it. I just recently purchased another critter trail habitat, this one a bit smaller, and it's also really good.I think these are probably the best small animal habitats on the market."
1,Extremely difficult to assemble!!,"I spent 2 hours trying to put this cage together. The ""instructions"" are horrible and the photos (what few there are) are gray,fuzzy, flat, and taken too far away from the object. After 2 hours I was completely exhausted and finally duct taped the whole thing together so my new little hamster at least has a place to sleep tonight. I'll be going out tomorrow and buying him a new cage that's easy to put together!"
3,looks great but cheaply made,"wore this one time and washed by hand when i washed with cold water the shirt ripped and got a hole in it and the buttons poped off when it got wet, had to sew by hand to fix.Looks cute and fits great however cheap quality"
5,Brilliant Trio,"Affinity is pretty close to as good as the Trio's live performance in London. Affinity reveals the depth of the TRIO's teamwork, and as well as ED THIGPEN's role as a drummer, showing off his impeccable brush work skills. Peterson and Brown are just as brilliant. Certainly worth a listen."
4,How the Dead Live,"Will Self is renowned for being the ""bad boy"" of fiction and this book follows that reputation. No novel about the afterlife can fail to make large obvious ideological statements about the living. Still, that doesn't take away from the pleasure of this book. Self is makes some moving statements about the female and Jewish identity. He is harsh to them because our culture is still racist and sexist in many ways we don't consciously recognize. You'll find this novel very enjoyable because it is filled with a lovely kind of dark humor."
5,Ambler,"Eric Ambler is one of the great spy novelist of all time. He had no real background in writing, but had a great natural talent. One of his outstanding books, often thought of as his best work, is ""A Coffin for Dimitrios"" It is a fascinating story beautifully written."
2,Not the quality I expect from Gardena,Was pleased with the loppers until the screw that holds the blades together needed thightening every other minute. I do not recomment this product.
3,Neal Carey is growing on me.,"Good further development of the Carey character, an enjoyable plot but some of the twists and turns in the second half of the book are a little hard to believe."
2,Hmmm Well...Help Me!!!,"Well I can say that the mic itself as looks is pretty decent. The shock mount could be a little better. But I purchased the mic awhile ago and finally pulled it out the box after buying a mic cable with usb, etc. but once I tried to connect to my mac pc. I tried using garageband, pro logic, reasons I did not work even tried to karaoke with it on my CASIO keyboard no sound, nothing. So if anybody know what I'm missing please let me know so that I can start recording."
5,Worked like a charm,"I purchased this product to put an aftermarket stereo in my 2000 forester. It worked great, was super easy to install. There were no problems what so ever."
5,"Fabulous artwork, adorable story!","Chris Conover has done it again and continues to give us outstanding children's books! This book will make a wonderful gift for the children on your list who love to see all the little critters in Conover's artwork...the story is enjoyable and an easy read for the adult too! In this day of the cardboard book, I appreciate this fine work of art and enjoy sharing Conover's work with all of my grandchildren."
1,don't buy it,"I was not happy with this book. I did not think this book gave a very positive view of parenting two children. It seemed to be very pessimistic - instead of giving helpful hints on how to juggle everything, it talked about how difficult it was. The comments from various people all seemed to be complaints, not tips or hints to help othersin the same situation. I will be exchanging this book for one of the other ones - it was depressing!"
1,Should not have been called Starship Troopers 2,This is a really strange movie. First of all it doesnt really have that much to do about Starship Troopers. It is definetly more of a horror movie than a sci-fi action movie like the first one was. I loved the first Starship Troopers but this one was a real let down. The acting isn't anything great but that is to be expected in these low budget horror movies. It really reminds me of one of those sci-fi channel original horror movies. I think they should have made thise movie without the Starship Troopers license because this one really taints the series. Starship Troopers 2 should have been a multi-million dollar extravaganza on par with the first one. Not this watered down cliched tv movie. The storyline is very cliched and the ending is really awkward and strange. Not even the naked girl could save this one.
2,Disappointing,"Once you accept the improbable Starship Troopers military concept of fighting an unending horde of fast and horrible monster spiders with foot troops armed only with rifles and pistols, the rest should be easy, but it isn't. Mobile infantry is okay, but there also should be mobile armor, mobile tactical air power, mobile tactical nukes, mobile artillery, etc. But there isn't so it's no wonder they get chopped up. The writer of SST seems to be totally naive and ignorant of modern military organization, tactics and firepower so the setting is woefully unrealistic from that standpoint.Cheap budget notwithstanding, I think the director and producers could have done much more with the script, plot and acting. I was put off with the inane idea of humans hosting little monsters internally, ala Aliens. If you like the basic concept of SST, rent it only, don't buy it."
3,not upto my expectations,looks like it was filmed in the directors basement. they must have been poor or not have enough for budget that they used scenes from the first movie.
1,Yuk,"This movie was so bad I can't belive I actually watched the entire thing. The first one was ok but this one... jeez. Thankfully, they didn't credit Robert Heinlein or he would be turning over in his grave.There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. None. Nada. I am going to go have a drink and try to forget it. Ugghhhh....."
1,what a f*ckin joke,the first movie was good at least it had good action not bad acting denise richerds was a perk. [I] always look forward to see her in a movie but what ever u do dont buy this move when i saw this movie i had never heard of it and i wonder why its the worst movie ever made enough said.
1,TERRIBLE! 0 STARS! from a fan of Starship Troopers,So many things wrong with this movie that I give it ZERO STARS!I'm not gonna waste my time redoing this review so I give it ZERO STARS!
1,Wow...,"Didn't think it would be THIS bad. I'm a big fan of the original and thought I could sit through it. I couldn't... I fell asleep.It's very much like a sci-fi horror flick from the 80's. The special effects had nothing special about them. One thing I didn't like from the original was when they were shooting the bugs up close and seemed to aim a bit high because of obvious reasons, the CG was filled in later. Part 2 was like watching a movie editted by a high school film class. Figured Tri-Star entertainment would've given them a bigger budget.I was so very disappointed. I've seen porn with better special effects."
1,Horrible,"Starship Troopers 1 this is NOT. Poor buget, poor acting, horrible story, inconsistent gun sounds, an actress who died in #1 playing another character in #2, poor lighting, laughable effects, absolutely stupid ending.This movie is a joke. I don't think you can even call it a movie. I can't even think of one reason why you'd even want to buy or rent this film.Recommended to avoid at all costs"
3,Better Than Expected,"After hearing rumors and critic reports about Starship Troopers-2, it took a long time for me to buy the movie for my collection. What I heard was incorrect. Starship Troopers-2 is a good Sc-fi, and a good addition to the original movie. The acting was good, the story was good, and the quality was that of the first show. I srongly suggest that if you have the first movie, you buy this one too.Thomas"
1,why did you guys ruin my favorite movie?,"Doesn't even deserve the name. If you think the first was a masterpiece as I do, your in for a real dissappointment. C-class movie doesn't even fare NEAR a B-movie. So bad, so so sad."
1,If only there could be no star,"I was shocked to see this on cable last night, and I have to say it was awful. The plot was as boring as bodysnatchers. Except for the bugs, which were nothing but the same rendered spiders from the first movie, it had almost nothing to do with starship troopers. No personality to any of the characters. It seemed that they were nothing but boot grads that were out on their first mission of death. The plot was so simple that you could see the whole movie roll out in front of you. The visual effects were horrible. Rendered bugs, sandstorms, and night, are all you can see. I'm gald I didn't buy or rent this movie."
2,Not what I expected,"WOW wrong turn. Starship troopers the first rockes, the graphics were awsome because that movie is old but old. And now this one is nothing new. First thing the new aliens arn't so new, ""Aliens"" did that, the paert were a creature gets in you and lays egg. ""The Thing"" did it too. It's something old. The other thing, in the end the main guy just stands there trying to kill some bugs and puts out some lame excuse saying murders dont go home or something like that. What ih he tying to proof. Look its more like a rent movie than a buy type a movie"
4,Makes Since,"Most people did not like the sequal to Starship Troopers but i think it really makes sense, i mean, the bugs fight on the frontlines but that leaves no room for sabitage or spies therefore a new type of bug had to be invented. The story would get boring with nothing but mindless bugs working for a few movement deficiant bugs and the humans having advanced technology . sure the first one rocked but wouldnet they try to creat spies it only makes since and besides the writter of the first also wrote this pone there for its officialy tied in to the upcoming third film. I also like the new guns. weapons change after years of war and advanced therefore projectile weapones give way to energy rifles of more caliber. I enjoyed the filom and believe it makes perfect since in such a war."
1,Painful,"I would gladly take my hour and a half back. I enjoyed the humor of ST 1, and there's only a nod in that direction here - so lame, it only serves to draw attention to its absence.Also, this turns into a slasher flick - a systematic knock-off of each of the characters and an exploration of how gruesome the special effects can be. Now, I'm not necessarily against this, though I don't really care for slasher flicks, other than to say that it becomes super BO-RING! And I do mean boringThere's not even really a ""B"" movie quality here that provides something memorable. Nope - nothing redeeming here. Don't bother -"
5,Best Game Boy Advance Video Ever!,I think this one is better because I am a DragonBall Series Fan and I enjoy all 3 of the shows alot. So I bought this and I enjoy this alot better than that spongebob Sh*t and this is really cool.
4,A New Perspective,"Buford allows you to enter into the minds of educated young African American males as they learn and grow throughout their four years of college. I enjoyed this book because it gives you a different perspective. I'm used to reading books from a woman's viewpoint but this one is a change from the norm. Read this to find out a variety of male viewpoints on life, love, and happiness."
2,Rachel in Leather = bad concept,"Rachel Sweet is undoubtedly one of the greatest singers to ever fall through the cracks. Fool Around is a great album. Unfortunately, her managers hadn't the slightest idea with what to do with this major talent. The result was Protect The Innocent, a release that stripped away all of Rachel's unique talent and replaced it with formulaic new wave/leather nonsense. As always, Rachel sounds great and she almost pulls this off by sheer talent alone."
4,Poetry Writer SP,"This is one dark book,it definitely not for light reading. But, it does give us an insight into the life of a woman with amazing talent for writing. A person could make a movie from this book. There is depression,an unfaithful husband,her death and the later death of the consort of the husband, which both Sylvia Plath and the other woman died the same way."
1,Hated It,"You are far better off reading Method and Madness, for a more intelligent and caring story about SP. Method and Madness is the definitive, though somewhat dated bio on Plath. Also enjoyed Lover of Unreason."
1,"WORST GAME EVER, DONT BUT THIS","FIFA 06 IS MOST DEFINIATLY THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. bad game play, block graphics, terrible load times, they have like 10 seconds buttons delay (send EA an email that this is 2006), there is absolutly no reason for 9 seconds delay in 2006 0r even 05. Even games made as early in 1994 no longer have delay. If you have fifa 04, continue playing playing it. If you have fifa 05, this might be a very good upgrade. Fifa 05 was way terrible than this (fifa06). -5 out of 5. I AM REALLY SAD THAT THERE IS NO ""0 OR EVEN -5 RATTING"". Thanks for reading. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS GAME"
2,This is old,Game is very old and you should never by it because it stinks and 07 for the PS2 is way better. Now I don't care what IGN says becasue there wrong and i'm right beleave me it stinks and I hate it.
5,sensational magazine,"I am extremely happy to fin that I can order the Record Collector-London England, Magazine through your website."
3,Long Weekend remake,"This is a remake of ""Long Weekend"". A 70's thriller from Australia, check it out worth seeing!"
5,Just as superb as the first volume,"I was really waiting for this second opus. It is just as perfect as the first volume. There's a difference, though: one of the song (Bantry Girls Lament) is sung. The famous Celtic sister Mary and Frances Black's voices mix just wonderfully with the Irish Whistle of Joanie Madden. I really hope there will be a third volume."
3,Beautiful Art Book but a little too sophisticated for kids..,"We are huge fans of Eric Carle so I had my husband pick this up for our 2 year old at the local bookstore (based on the title). While it is a beautiful book/collaboration, it is not very ""kid-friendly"". There's really no storyline and half the book is written in Japanese. The first 5 pages or so consist of a different animal asking the dog ""Where are you going?""...and the dog replied ""To see my friend!""....I have to admit that I am disappointed with this one. I will treasure it more as an art book than a children's book."
4,comfy cushion,"The memory foam cushion is very comfortable for my back. However, I found the ""massage"" function irritating. It's more like a vibrating mode that gives me a headache after a few minutes. I can only turn it on briefly to ""massage"" and turned it off before it bothers my head. Overall, I used it as a cushion to support my back when I spent hours on my computer. In addition, the battery compartment is very tight that putting in or removing batteries can be very difficult. I put in Duracell batteries and hopfully I won't have to change batteries for a while."
1,I wish I could give it a 0 star,Massage useless To small and not strong enough for heavy people: Finally it get so HOT it becomes unusable after ten minutes. I sent it back for credit and will avoid this company at all costs
1,after 3 months>>>>,"after using this product for a while it lost its shape , the massage is a joke feature .don't buy !!!!!"
4,The dopest Female Rap Group,"These sistas ruled the rap game for females in the late 80's and early 90's. This album had a lot of hits like ""Expression"", ""Do You Really Want Me"", and the commercial hit ""Lets Talk About Sex"". This was also the first project where Salt N Pepa got to show their skills as writers and producers besides Herby Luvbug and this album was just incredible this is definitely a Salt N Pepa classic and should be copped by all hip hop fans."
4,"NIce set of Kitchen tools, Caddy too small","Ordered these tools as our old ones have been stained by too many washes in the dishwasher. My wife found them on amazon and wanted them so I ordered them. They seem well made and sturdy, however the Caddy that holds them seems cramped.We have only used them a couple of days, but they ""feel"" like they are high quality kitchen tools. Hopefully the cramped caddy will not be much of an issue.EDIT: Have used these tools for the past year, and they are definately quality tools. The cramped caddy is a little bit of an issue, but the tools have held up nicely to a year of cooking with them."
1,OXO website terrible,OXO if you read this please do something about contact info. You ask for phone number and I dont want to give it. Even when adding a number there is a repeated error message. Please get your act together this is sloppy customer service and irritating
3,Limited terrain vehicle,"the tires are hard plastic with very little tread, as a result it doesn't do well on surfaces such as grass, tile, hardwood, or gravel. it goes well on concrete and asphalt but always has wheelspin at start as there is no throttle modulation, it is either on or off. it has very little steering angle also. its turning circle is about as large as my f150"
2,It has purple on it!,"I bought this for my son thinking it was all blue, (I got it at sears) When I opened it the seat was purple along with a few other parts, so if you don't want your boy to ride on a purple and indigo quad, i suggest you get the toy story one or something. But other than that these are cool lil' quads for kids"
3,We have an 18 month old,"She is a very daring girl who likes to ride and swing and just be adventurous. And she loves it. Overall its pretty cheap but it works fine. I expect the life of it to be about as long as she will be interested.Problems: Wheels are so slick it won't work on hardwood. Tires just spin. I fixed this by adding a strip of duct tape around the back tires. Now she cruises through the kitchen and gets better traction on the carpet.She fits is great but its hard for her to turn.Oh, a great thing about this one is that you arent paying for the disney or nickelodeon characters. Same bike but it is an additional 50$ for the branding."
2,SOMETHINGS MISISING,LORI TRYING TO DO BACKING VOCAL PARTS LIKE THE SOUND THAT USED TO HAPPEN WHEN ALL THE SISTERS SANG.....SOMEHOW IT DOSNT CUT IT WHY NOT JUST HAVE YOUR SISTERS WITH YOU ALL SHARING IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS GLORIOUS MUSIC.....BRING BACK PERRI LORI AND SING THE PRAISES TOGETHER......AS ONLY SISTERS CAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"Bright lights, low price","There are no street lights around my house so I need bright lights on the front of the garage and by the front door. Fluorescent and LED bulbs have been disappointing for a number of reasons so for these fixtures I like clear incandescent bulbs. They all arrived undamaged and the ones I've used so far have been excellent. The brightness is close to the endangered 100 watt bulbs, especially compared to a soft white 100 watt. With 24 of them -- at a very reasonable price -- I won't have to worry about running out for a while."
5,seet valley memories,this dvd is fantastic I forgot how funny this show was and how bad jessica was it never ocurred to me until I watched it and realize jessica is evil in a fun way the acting is campy but it's the whole setting that makes it fun naturaly liz is the smart sister that gets her out of a jam as usual yet jess is the one who causes them anyway one of the strange episodes is kidnapped which takes the series to a high level of drama when liz who works in a hospital as a candy striper is kidnapped by a girl obsessed janitor (why hospitals don't do proper background checks I will never know) but while this was going on jessica is still chasing boys go figure natually of course liz is found by her friends. one of the real fun episodes is with jessica dating a royal prince from another country not only is this a hoot to see her in love and not just using men for her own whims but she shows off her rocking body in some serious bikini scenes.
1,"If you want accuracy, keep on looking.","If all you want is a cheap sprinkler for the kids to run through, this is a pretty good bargain -- if you get it for $10 or less. If you want a sprinkler that you can adjust to hit a certain area, this ain't it! The markings on the dial are fairly cryptic, plus there's no clear identification of what each icon is supposed to line up with. There are no instructions on or in the box, or online. I thought I could figure it out with a little experimentation, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of finesse to the system.Like I said, keep looking."
1,Flimsy and odd to adjust,"Bought two. 'Wish I'd bought none.- One snapped apart at its hose connector within two weeks. It has a very weak, non-durable plastic connector so you have to treat these Very Gently -- not how I'm accustomed to treating gardening tools.- I'm not very happy with the patterns it sprays, but... I don't expect the remaining unit to last long enough for this to matter.Just do yourself a favor and find another product!"
3,"Flimsy, but great coverage","Flimsy, easily broken, but great coverage. I go through about one per season. I could buy a more expensive, sturdier version, but I suspect it would still get broken by kids stepping on it or the lawn service accidentally mowing over it (as has happened in past years). This sprinkler works very well on low pressure as well as high, which is key if you want to water a small area of the yard. When turned on high, it covers an area of about 30 feet."
3,Did not work for me.,"After about a week of use, my unit stopped oscillating and one half of the jets only spurted weakly. I tried cleaning the nozzles, but that didn't fix the problem.I am on well water, and there are a lot of minerals in my water, so it's certainly possible that the nozzles got clogged up or something, but one way or another, this product simply won't work for me. I've stepped up to an impact sprinkler that has been working much better.When the product was working, it worked fine, but it stopped working shortly after I bought it."
2,Broke after two weeks,"This sprinkler worked well for two weeks, giving a nice even flow of water. After that, the plastic connector piece to the hose broke off. Based on this experience, I would not buy it again. If you do buy it, be careful with the connection to the hose."
5,great for travel and at-home quiet time game,"We love this set, it's very durable and the carry-case is a huge bonus.My daughter likes all of it, the lacing shapes and the locktagon construction set especially. Her friends have had fun playing with it too. It's been very durable, and when she grows out of it we will pass it on to someone else. This is a great buy, educational and fun!!"
1,None,This is the same story as Rustlers of Pecos County. The names are different and it starts with more of a history on the ranger but other than that the plot and most of the dialogue are exactly the same. Good thing it was free or I would be crying foul.
1,Piece of Junk - Do not buy,"As others have said, this saw is junk. With no motor lock to change the blade it is useless. The instructions don't even offer a method for installing the first blade.I have a brand new one I plan to dump. Next."
3,Didn't work as well as I've heard.,"I had trouble with it peeling off my shirts. I have an average printer and the designs weren't too elaborate, so it printed ok. I think some people have better luck with it not peeling, but all mine have started peeling at some point."
1,I Love Will....,"BUT, do not buy this. I did not take the advise of the other reviews and bought it anyway, thinking they did not understand his comedic genious. I am such a fool. His first ""Best of"" is fantastic! This was just more of the first disk (honestly, half of the disk was more of the same skits!!) and a rather failed attempt to give you more cow bell. I hate to write a bad review, but save your money and your time."
5,god's gift to the race of man,"seeing this dvd is like looking into the face of god for the first time and him replying ""you are my most wonderful creation"". if this dvd had been a woman, i would have undoubtably made sweet love to her. I would not hesitate to sacrifice my first born child in order to stand in the same room with someone who has heard of someone who has a friend who has seen this glorious movie. Will Ferrell makes Gandhi look like a child pornographer. ""Brandon, Michael... wanna be a buddy and get off the shed!!"" ....and i hate ya, sweet jesus...no but seriously i haven't been hard in years. GOULET!! You bet your balls its neil diamond. ""OOOOh peaches!"" I would be more worried about cayotes if i was yer!"" ""Ahh cinnamon and gravy!"""
1,"Predominantly Unfunny, Waste of Money and Talent, DON'T BUY!","Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Will Farrell's comedic talent just as much as the next man. However, this batch of skits made me wonder just how in the world SNL chooses their skit writers.This is the worst collection of skits I have ever seen in one of their ""Best Of"" DVDs. The first skit of George W. Bush is fine, and there are a few here that will incite a few mild chuckles, but the majority of these are painfully unfunny. Most of them resort to cheap pleas for laughs with Farrell resorting to some sort of comic violence, and even then, it's still not funny.I was about halfway on the first set. Loved Harry Caray, George W. Bush, Celebrity Jeopardy, and such. But this is utterly worthless, and pales in comparison. Honestly, I am angered that I spent fifteen bucks on this, and I am selling it immediately to a second hand store. Don't waste your money. Save it for the DVD release of ""Elf""."
1,The reviews are funnier than the DVD.,"Save your $15 and buy your wife a bouquet of flowers.Instead, I recommend getting yourself a bowl of popcorn and reading the reviews, they are MUCH funnier than the DVD itself. One would think Will Ferrell would give his stamp of approval in some way to this joke they call a DVD. This disappointment is going to take up a lot of space in our countries landfills."
2,I was dissapointed,"I loved the first Will Ferrell dvd. The only problem with it is that there were still so many more skits that I wanted to see. I was very happy when I heard they were making a second volume. The problem, though, is that this DVD doesn't have any of the skits I was hoping for. How can you have a ""Best of Will Ferrell"" DVD without showing his Neil Diamond? (Except for that 2 seconds in the outtakes of the first volume) I was also hoping that I can see some Ted Kaczynski, but none on this DVD either. I was surprised to see that a few of the sketches on the second volumes were ones that were in the first volume, only in smaller pieces. What about his John Rocker sketch? What about the ""Get off the shed"" sketch? (The real one, not the one in his audition). I was also surprised that there wasn't any ""Spartans"", ""Celebrity Jeopardy"", or ""Morning Latte"" clips in this volume. Overall, Will is a comedic genius. I just hope they come out with a third volume."
3,Great Books on saint Collette,"I love the books on saint collette....she is an amazing Poor Clare, the order of santa chiara of Assisi, Saint Francis' friend. these books were hard to find so it was great that Amazon had them as they are fairly esoteric!thank you,Angela Alioto"
3,So Annoying!,"While it was fascinating to see what would happen if Miyazaki and Tim Burton got together for an anime title, there are just too many things that bother me about this series. Arusu is one of the least likeable heroines I've come across in a long time, the story is drawn out and really felt like it went nowhere within the first seven episodes and despite all the plot hooks that they are dangling in front of me, none of them make me want to pick up the second volume. While younger members of the viewing audience might get into this fantasy title a bit more, I think anyone else is going to find themselves bored and wanting to smack Arusu upside the head just as much as I did. Pass on this one and save your money for something else."
3,Made,If you love Swingers then you will probably like this movie which is more about the natural chemistry between the actors than the story.
2,Can't get rid of Spanish subtitles,"Can't get rid of Spanish subtitles - very distracting. All other DVD's work fine in my player, so it's the DVD."
1,Received 2 that did not vibrate.,The first one I received did not vibrate. I returned it for a replacement and the replacement did not work either. I returned the second one and asked for a refund.
4,Very fine work,"Boaz has assembled a very fine collection of essays regarding liberty and the failings of modern societies to create a world in which we can live as free men. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone remotely interested in libertarian (or for that matter free market or conservative) political thought.Just to tone down my entheusiasm a bit, though, I would add that many of the essays may seem a little elementary to someone who has been reading libertarian publications for a long time. But on the whole, this is a solid, highly readable work full of ammunition for your libertarian debating arsenal."
2,I hate all sprinklers,"The problem I've had with lawn sprinklers of any price is that they don't work very well, and then they break. True to form, this Melnor from the start oscillated unevenly, rotating much more drastically to the left than to the right, necessitating multiple trips out into the drenched and swampy lawn to try to fine-tune the placement. Eventually, if this one behaves like its predecessors, it'll stop oscillating entirely and water fixedly to the left only. The reason I like this sprinkler a little more than the others is simply that I paid a lot less for it, so when I finally lose what's left of my patience and rip it to pieces it won't bother me so much (though I will of course bemoan the needless waste of our precious natural resources). Gilmours are even worse than Melnors, if that helps."
4,decent,"Decent sprinkler, at least for smaller areas. However, I found a much better price for the same style sprinkler at Lowes. I was only able to use it for less than 2 months, so I can't report on its reliability."
5,Inspiring and thoroughly enjoyable music,"As a listener who loves music but has no particular musical background, I found this CD a real treat, inspiring, relaxing and enjoyable. Although I loved Leonarda's music, I found the selections by Peruchona even lovelier. The soprano, Andrea Folan, does a wonderful job in interpreting this music. I have played this CD over and over and would hope that other selections of these two early women composers will be presented. I was particularly pleased with the introductory notes of Madeline Welch which gave such a fine historical background. A wonderful job also by producers, instrumentalists, choirs and soloists. Congratulations!"
5,Great Book!,Portraits was a wonderful book that has been passed through all of my family so far. Everyone I know loves it! Can anyone tell me what Portraits sequel name is?
4,Cowboy Culture,I liked True Tales of Old Time Kansas more than this book because it is quite long versus a bunch of short stories. If you want a detailed account of the history of Cowboys- you will want to read this book. Dary is a great author.
5,Water Filter,The filter I purchased from filters fast was the correct filter for my whirlpool refridgerator & was shipped in a timely matter. I will use them again.
5,Very happy!,I had a very fast delivery and everything came. The filters work great and the price was reasonable. Thank you for all your help.
1,Thought I was getting the -10 model for cyst reduction,"I thought I was getting the -10 model for Cryptospiridium cyst reduction, not the -08 of lesser quality."
5,Quality product and save money,Amazon shipped the filter as their posted and take a 7-day to arrival after placing the order. It is expected since I use a free shipping.It is a annually replacement item in the refrigerator. This a quality product and save money by order it from Amazon that comparing to buy it from a local store.
4,"Good filter, good price",The same filter you'll find in the stores for more money. This filter is actually made by Pur so you can compare it with the comparable Pur product. I bought this for a Kenmore side-by-side that takes a filter that goes in the bottom front grille.
1,Had to return the item,It didn't fit even though all necessary matching numbers were correct - the top is way different than they used to be
4,Right product and quality for filter that is getting hard to find,"I used to buy these filters in the store, then I had to order them. I found different prices and quality from many places but now the choices are fewer unless you don't care about the quality. This is my first order through Amazon but as long as they keep selling the filters I'll keep coming back. Just wish the price didn't have to go up."
4,"Good filters, incorrect instructions to change it.","These filters are good. The water pressure is hardly affected when the filter is installed, until you need to actually change the filter. One minor problem is in the instructions for changing the filter. The instructions state to turn the existing filter counter-clockwise 1/4 turn. However, with my particular refrigerator (Whirlpool ED5RHAXNT00), I had to turn the existing filter clockwise to remove it."
4,seems to work fine,"Since we have no idea how it works or what it does, we have to rely on taste. Water does taste better with the filter than from the tap. It was easy to install once you figure out the way to turn it.Be prepared for some spit back of water at first."
4,Great product,After checking with Lowe's for a filter I found this one on the internet. I am glad I went this route saving alot of money.
4,Refrigerator filter,"The item arrived on time and, so far, has worked well. It would have been better to have clearer installation instructions."
4,Another satisfied customer!,"I'm happy with the service.The delivery was good, eventhough I picked the cheap route.(Maybe even faster delivery in the future.)I won't hesitate to buy from FiltersFast again.Keep up the good work!"
1,Best brand but would not fit all the way into my fridge.,"Unfortunately, this particular filter did not fit my fridge filter tube. Had used same brand in past but it must have been different model #. Had it way too long to send back. Appliance store now charges $40 for one of the Pur water filters. Wish co. would idicate exactly which of their filters will fit which models. They don't seem to offer the filter I used to buy any longer. Sears costs even more than local store & we have to order by mail & pay shipping charges."
2,Was not sure if it is new or not.!!,came in package that was damaged and seemed opened. I had my doubts about its status as a new product. Buyer be aware.
5,I love it!!,I can't say enough good things about this mixer!! It's everything I was looking for and more!
3,Not a great mixer... adequate,"While light duty mixing is reasonable for this mixer, anything such as bread or cookie dough may cause problems... The first difficulty is having the bowl stay in place... Ours had a tendency to jump off the hooks and send the bowl to the floor. KitchenAide was quick to respond and sent me an ineffective clip to hold the bowl on the hook - I bent a hanger over the lip of the bowl and the lift arm --- crisis averted... I was beating up some bread dough the other day and stripped the gear in the transmission... It is a fairly simple fix but one that will probably cost 30 or 40 dollars for a replacement gear - Time spent determining problem: 30 minutes... I wish it this mixer was built to a higher standard - it almost seems like it should be disposable..."
5,mix it up,Love it. I do a lot of baking for my family and this mixer was an upgrade for me. Went from the artisan to this mixer was like adding a nitro booster to my mixer. Also the sale of the century to me. Bought it at a better price than my smaller mixer I replaced.
3,cloudy tank,"This product did an o.k. job but not outstanding, it is such a very fine type of granule that it comes through just about every pouch sock made for filters that it was all over everything.The water never cleared up like i thought it should.oh well i learned to double pouch and buy larger amounts might make it work better."
5,Wish I'd bought these years ago,"They are exactly as everyone describes. It only took a couple of minutes to cut them to fit my pans, and the creases from being folded came right out.With regular parchment paper a little bit of the bottom of my whoopie pies remained on the paper when I removed them, but with these they came right off with barely a crumb left behind. Between batches of chocolate chip cookies a quick swipe with a paper towel left them clean and ready for the next batch.They worked equally well with perforated and non-perforated cookie sheets. I ordered two to try them out, but now I'm ordering more, because I'm sold!"
5,Must have,"I wanted to buy a silpat for my cookie sheets because I bake a lot and thought it was wasteful to be throwing away all that parchment paper. However, my cookie sheets are large (about 13.5x18). This seemed like the best fit and was reusable, so I bought it. So glad I did!It is a thin, coated parchment paper. My baked goods come off perfectly from it, and it's easy to clean. The coating is supposed to be silicone, and feels a bit waxy (in a good way). I love this so much I bought another one! Now I have one for both cookie sheets."
5,Water timer review,"A nicely designed water timer that uses 9V instead of 1.5V battery, making it more reliable for the whole summer. Simple and easy to program, very compact, with a simple, durable valve that opens and closes with a click, rather than a running motor."
3,CROSS-DRESSING AS A CULTURAL PHENOMENON,"Marjorie GarberVested Interests:Cross-Dressing and Cultural Anxiety(New York: Routledge, 1992) 443 pages(ISBN: 0-415-90072-7; hardcover)(Library of Congress call number: HQ77.G37 1991)A wide-ranging book on the public manifestationsof wearing the clothes and adopting the manners of the other sex,especially as seen in the mass media--television, movies, magazines.Cross-dressing for the following reasons:entertainment in the theatre and movies;respect in the workplace;to express the other-gender side of one's personality;for personal sexual interest, arousal, & orgasm;as an element of one's homosexual sex-script;to 'pass' as the other sex;transsexualism--because one believes one is 'really' the other sex;This book explores cross-dressing as a cultural phenomenon,rather than a psychological phenomenon.If you would like to read better books on cross-dressing,search the Internet for this bibliography:""Cross-Dressing Bibliography"".James Leonard Park"
4,Collection near complete,"At first sight I thought it was a new copy.The book is in very good condition, spine not broke and no 'dog-ear' pages.The cover still has its like-new texture.I am pleased with this purchase.paul"
4,Like this movie,I like this movie since I saw it on Movies on demand from Cablevision and had to get it for myself. The action is intense. And to think a woman can be so tough is unreal but true.
2,"""Not Rated"" and Not Intact","The package came destroyed, leaving both discs pretty damaged. Fortunately they both still work, but it's obvious on both discs something got them scratched up and they're now without a case to hold them since the one they were shipped in was smashed.The movies themselves though were alright, besides the fact that 'Not Rated' and Unrated I thought meant the same thing, but these are the censored versions without extended scenes like the director's cut versions, and I was hoping to get both in 1 package instead of having to hunt down both full un-cut individually.Overall, the movies were still ok, but the package was poorly protected assuming it wasn't broken before shipping, and they should rate these movies since they're not the full-length ones."
4,Edge Juice box,"Very nice controler,does what I was told and read about them.I realize now why so many people get rid of the competertives controlers"
5,shape sorter review,"This item has proved to be alot of fun for my daughter, she is 11 months old and loves sorting the shapes and putting them on the pegs. My only suggestion would be pegs that don't come out because she puts the pegs in her mouth and crawls around, which, is dangerous. All in all it was worth the money. I would just like one where the pegs don't come out."
1,Doesn't stay together.,My daughter is 18 months old and takes this toy apart every time she plays with it. She pulls the pegs out and puts them in her mouth. Then she tosses the shapes everywhere. Not exactly a sorter! Just a mess. Save your money!
2,frustrating,"I bought this toy for my 18 mo old to help with learning shapes and colors. The toy is frustrating for him to use on his own. The pegs do not stay in the foam base and are a little challenging for him to get back in on his own. Any time he tries to pull the pieces off, the whole peg comes out of the base. Okay toy with adult assistance, but definately not what I expectd. Great idea, but not well thought out."
3,You'll Lose Pieces!,"My 2 1/2 year-old loves this, but the pieces are rarely used for actual ""stacking."" If you buy it, be prepared to find the pieces tucked away all over your house!"
5,Great for Students,"I'm using this with an advanced OOP class in C++ right now and it explains many things very well. A great buy, worth my money and time!"
5,Great book,This book is amazing! It doesn't assume I know anything and I love that. It shows you examples of code and then analyzes that code line by line.
5,I love this product!!,I have always used this product as a part of my craft projects. It always gives a great performance! I would not use anything else. The Amazon price was MUCH lower than other retail stores where I usually buy this. I will definitely buy from Amazon in the future
2,Disappointed,"Even though the workbook does help ""outline"" subject matter it failed to offer study helps to assist in learning this complicated information. The tests would have been much more helpful if they explained why the answer was correct. I will continue to use it for the course, but I do not see it being of much help to me. The text book does a good job summarizing the ""high points"" in the summary after each chapter."
1,DO NOT BUY FOR DWARF HAMPSTERS!,"Do not buy this cage for a dwarf hampster. We came home one afternoon to find our sweet little hampster expired on the bottom of the cage, with his nose stuck firmly in the mesh. We had used the cage for about eight months without incident, and the hampster seemed to enjoy it, but he got stuck somehow and couldn't extricate himself.It took my poor husband some time to get him out, so we could give him a proper burial. I think the squares in the mesh are dangerous for the little animals. I don't know if it poses a problem for the larger hampsters."
2,OKAY/ALRIGHT,"Salt-n-Pepa reaches their lowest points on this one. This sophmore effort has got be their weakest. On this one S-n-P abandon their more rough no-nonsense style that was presence on their debut, in favor of a more pop/rap commercial sound. The results are a couple of stand-out tracks, the title track, and ""Get Up Everybody"", and the rest is dissmissable filler. ""Shake Your Thang"", the album's hit is one of the weaker tracks. If you are collecting Salt-n-Pepa's work, save this one for last, maybe you'll appreciate it better.Peace El-715"
1,Dishonesty and greed should not be rewarded,"This is one of the better series to come out in a long time. But breaking up the season and getting us to pay more for it this way is a slap in the face to the fans. Don't reward this greedy behavior, or you can count on this type of rip off in the future too. Buy the full season for the more reasonable price of $30, instead of 6 x $10 each:Star Wars The Clone Wars: The Complete Season One (TV Series)"
1,As a marketing stratagem this is probably good,In terms of customer relations this is incredibly short sighted.1 star for releasing season 1 in such a form.
3,Great history lesson; good message; unbelievable heroine.,"For the most part, I enjoyed this book. The historical aspect is very interesting and the plot is unique. The message - that convention can be paralyzing to all types of societies (religious, military, political, geographic) - is stong enough to stand on its own. Only a male author would feel the need to create the perfect woman to deliver that message. Julia is perfect in every aspect - she is young and physically beautiful (with long blonde hair); she is compassionate, benevolent, intelligent, mentally stable, strong, opinionated, and couragous. She enjoys and desires sex. She possesses a keen sense of humor and a perspective on life that is typically exhibited by much older characters. She is, in a word, unbelievable."
2,"It feels very, very rushed.","""From the Earth to the Moon"" is a great story, but this particular edition falls flat. The book's description is nonexistent, as the entry refers to 'classic works' that should not be forgotten, with no mention of the particular product in question. The author's source is clearly labeled in the back of the book, which itself is poorly edited and checked. There are spelling mistakes and the paragraphs are not indented (giving it copy/paste appeal with no formatting). Even the table of contents is incorrect. The table of contents.At 8 1/2"" x 11"", it feels inelegant, more like a textbook than a classic adventure novel. It's possible it was designed like this, but most likely the larger format makes for an easier packaging of other large classic works.It's Jules Verne, which is a great thing. But there may be better, more attractive editions to gravitate towards."
1,From the Earth to the Moon and a Trip Around It,"From the Earth to the Moon and A Trip Around It is a clasic... but this copy of the book was a let down. The book has a polished look to it, and is much larger than the picture in my head. the faunt is large, and has NO vintage look to it. When you look at the pictue shown and compare it to the book you ordered, you are disapointed."
2,Question the credibility,"I have recently completed reading Gordon Thomas's Gideon's Spies - the Secret History of the Mossad. I found that he had some truly astonishing information in the book that I had a problem with believing. I therefore contacted 3 very credible acquaintances of mine - who between them are extremely knowledgeable (I believe to be experts) about Israel and terrorists. Each of them responded to me, that they never heard of either the book or the author. I found that very strange and now have a very difficult time trusting any of the info in the book."
2,Too many emberassing mistakes..,"Although this is an interesting, some may even say thrilling, book, it is plagued by so many blatant inaccuracies and factual mistakes that it is difficult to take anything written by the author too seriously. Most of the Hebrew words are either ridiculously misspelled, or translated incorrectly, which immediately takes away from the credibility of the book. In addition to factual mistakes, there are also emberassing ""logical"" errors. The most blatant one perhaps is when the author tells of a meeting regarding the hostage-taking in Munich in 1972. He goes on to write that the participants couldn't help but think about the daring hostage rescue in Entebbe and wonder whether a repeat performence was possible. The problem, the Entebbe raid was in 1976...enough said."
5,Excellent,"Excellent in all regards. The book is captivating, hard to put down. Loved all of it. Would recommend it to anyone with such interests."
2,Yawn.,"Other readers have commented on blatant translation errors or chronological discrepancies. Given my limited knowledge of the subject matter, I cannot offer any insight here. Most salint for me, though, are the shortcomings in Thomas' writing style. I found it utterly unengaging in its blandness. The disjointed chronology and Thomas' lack of credible support for his yarns also did him no favors. Surely there are better works on the subject."
4,Conflict without End,Pretty interesting. Will appeal primarily to aficionados of the Middle East conflict. The French directors and producers of this subtitled documentary attack the Al Manar station for lacking journalistic objectivity and serving as an anti-Israeli propaganda arm of the Lebanese Shiite militants known as Hezzbolah. But the station managers and journalists unabashedly acknowledge the charges and openly proclaim that their aim is the elimination of Israel
1,It can not be trusted,I bought it and it worked for one day. Second day it did not workIf you buy it you will find out it is unreliable piece of junk
2,low battery indicator does not work,"low battery indicator does not worki put a battery inunit would not manually turn water on/off[[did not operate the valve]]low battery indicator never came onworks fine with 'different' batterywtfwhat does 'low battery' mean?it's REALLY dead, but by the way there is some mystery state where it doesn;t work but the battery isn't 'low'?i mean the battery indicator should indicate 'it is not going to do what you expect it to do'wtfwhat ELSE is it going to screw up?also i hate the battery changingscrews are not attached,have to pry the cover off,then the cover isn;t attached,have to find a screwdriver,hard to see and decode polarity indicators,blahit may go back to the store soonwle"
1,Don't waste your money...,"Considering how much landscaping costs, there's little reason to scrimp on timers. I learned this the hard way, coming home from vacation to find my yard brown and parched. This timer, which was less than a year old had failed, and as a result, so did my grass.I'm now in the market for a new one that actually works."
1,Perfectly Random Water Timer,"This thing looks like it should be a great timer. The interface is just about perfect for what it does. You just set the current hour, then when you would like it to come on in the day, how many days between each watering, and how long to water each time. Then the device promptly ignores all input and starts turning on and off at random. I love seeing the screen say ""Current Time: 3pm, Start Time: 8am"" and yet it's wide open and currently watering my lawn. I have one of those ""fft fft fft"" swiveling sprinklers that's actually pretty loud, and so can't be run at night without keeping myself and probably a couple neighbors from sleeping. So I had a blast getting out of bed last night at 12:30 to turn off my psychopathic water timer."
3,Lots of room for improvement,"Having a need for two more timers for our garden, we decided to give this model a try (we already have a Gilmour Electronic 4 Cycle Water Timer) - MISTAKE.1. You cannot set the EXACT time - you can only set the hour. This means that your timing for wetting may be off by up to 59 minutes.2. For manual watering, you cannot set a time but must use the default 30 minute setting. Thus, I have to remember to go back out and turn it back on for another 30 mins.3. You cannot set days of the week to water or to skip.While it does the job of a basic timer, it does not compare to the flexibility to which we are accustomed with the Gilmour.Structurally it appears a little light but I have not had any of the problems of the other reviewers."
1,Melnor 3015 is total garbage; does not work,"Simply does not work.Called the manufacturer. Went through the whole protocol.Said I was doing everything correctlyGot a second set of new long lasting batteries. Still did not work.Never would work. Waste of time.This happened with both units I bought.I know it sounds like I am doing something incorrectly.It does not appear that this is the case.You can program it and turn it on with the manual switch but the timer function does not work.Do not ever buy this brand.As another review said, ""Why do they make things that don't work?"""
1,Didn't last a year,"Worked fine the first season, but now it doesn't. I'd recommend another option, if you can find one."
1,Inaccurate time,"I purchased one of these, set the time and settings, and hooked it up to my sprinklers. It fired three hours early. Interesting. I noticed the time had drifted by three hours, so I set the current time again. Same deal. It fired three hours early. On one other day, it just picked a time at random.Returned it, as the unit I had was defective.The replacement did the same thing. The time drifted, and it started watering my lawn three hours early.That's enough of that. These units would be fine, if they worked right, but they don't. Additionally, the buttons don't work right, and require repeated presses to make any change. The user interface is actually pretty good, but the unit itself is poorly engineered."
1,Wish I'd read these reviews,"I wish I'd read these reviews before purchasing the Melnor 3015. I've returned 2 purchased this week from Home Depot. Neither one would prevent water from moving through the device while out of the programmed ""on"" time. Home Depot is great about taking them back, but what a waste of time and gas. After first fail, I called customer service and operator listened to about 2 sentences and said, ""it's defective, take it back"". Based on reviews here, I'm guessing that they get lots of complaints."
1,Do Not Buy,"I bought mine under the ""Vigoro"" brand name at a hardware store, not thru Amazon (the design is identical, down to the programming). This lasted for about 10 months before it stopped working. I opened up the battery compartment and it was flooded with water. I let it dry for a good three days before putting in a fresh battery. The numbers came on, I programmed it, hooked it up, but no dice. The valve never worked again under automatic mode, only manual mode."
1,Inlet broke,"After a year of use the inlet broke off- luckily while I was screwing the hose in. Bad news if it breaks while you are not there! I couldn't return it to home depot because of the time so I decided to check it out... the part that ""broke off"" seemed to be a press fit... there was no broken plastic, little indication of glue. The press fit just seemed to come out- not good at all.I decided to use some epoxy and repair the unit... something that melnor should use in the first place!Also it's a bit funky selecting the program on/off... I have to press the button multiple times to get it to respond."
1,Broke after one season,"This model seemed to work fine for the first year, but when I tried it out for this summer, everything works except the valve-- ie, it doesn't turn the water off at all. Manual override makes a clicking sound inside the body, but the water doesn't turn off. Moving on to a different brand. And I can't find any way to open it up to see if it's fixable. NOT recommended."
2,Worked well until it broke,"It worked great for about 8 months. Easy to set, worked at the right times. Then some gasket or other broke on the inside, and when it turned on, it would just flood water throughout the whole thing."
1,Couldn't keep time after the first year,"I only used this product for one summer. It worked fine at first, but by the end of the summer it couldn't keep time any longer. Fresh batteries didn't help.Find a better product."
1,badly made,"This product worked well for a week, then the timer quit working. I unscrewed the top plastic hose coupling to take a closer look at it,and when I reattached it,the uper hose coupling sprang a big leak. I thought it was me, or just a defective part. After the fact I read all the reviews, and realized that it is a terrible product."
1,Not worth it,"I have several timers around my property. This is the only one I have problems with. The battery dies in a week. I have tried several different battery brands, including rechargeable and they all die within a week."
4,"Very Good, Handle Carefully.","This is a great timer, very easy to use. Unlike my previous timers, it is easy to change/check one aspect of the water program. I also like the Manual 30 minute water feature. I live in New England, we have rough winters here! I bought 3 of these timers 3 years ago from Home Depot. 2 of them are still working properly, but one did not survive the winter(left in the garage). The display of the 1 broken timer seems to be peeling off from the inside. However, the other 2 are great (For the first 2 years I stored the timers in the house over the winter.).I recommend bringing these timers into the house to store them through the winter, if you live somewhere with very cold winters. Also- replace the battery each year, removing the battery over the winter season.Again- these are so easy to set and to adjust, it more than makes up for their cost."
1,Don't buy this piece of junk,Two years ago I bought one of these water timers for my garden. Worked fine that summer. The next summer I hooked it up and it leaked like a sieve. I bought another because that was all my local store had. Worked fine that summer but once again when I tried to use the second one this summer the it leaked. If they cost $5 it might be worth it but for $30 there are a lot of better options.
1,do not buy,"I rarely write negative reviews, however this is one product to stay away from. Adding another ""1 star"" to the rest of the reviews here, I bought 2 of these devices at the same time. One broke off from the faucet within the first week and the other had water in the battery compartment the same week. It is clear this design is faulty.I have since bought a Gilmour 9400 that is more expensive, however is working as advertised."
1,Piece of junk,"These timers are junk pure & simple!. I bought two of them at Home Depot and had to return both of them. On the first one, the valve wouldn't work either in the automatic or manual modes. On the second unit I had the same problem with the valve plus the connector that attaches to the faucet was broken off the body right out of the package."
5,Melnor 3015 Rotary original,Also received the newer model and haven't yet tried it.Have had great results with the original rotary designamd just love it. Bring back the original and waterproofthe battery housing if need be.My battery has lasted multiple seasons.
3,Great Design-Durability an issue,"I love the design and functionality of these timers. However, as with other users, I have found reliability and durability to be an issue. To mitigate the reliability issue, I placed a pressure regulator in front of these, and it seems to make them last longer. I used the pressure regulator that came with my mist watering system, using it in front of the timer, rather than after. I still buy this product, but end up replacing about half of the units each year. Melnor should definitely look into the quality problems with these."
1,Harsh look at motherhood,"I really this book would make me laugh, but it certainly did not. It makes me said that the author feels this way about motherhood. I was going to give this book to a friend who is expecting but instead, I threw it in the trash."
5,Sometimes the Truth Hurts,"Fortunately in Stephanie Wilder-Taylor's book it also makes you laugh out loud. This book is a must have for new parents who feel overwhelmed with the havoc wreaked by their new bundle of joy. Thank G-d there's a writer like Ms. Wilder-Taylor out there to make you feel a little less alone and laugh a little bit more during that disorienting first year of being a parent. A great gift for anyone, mostly yourself."
1,"If you care about your child, choose another book!!!!!","I cannot believe books like this are published!! If you want to be a great mom--DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!! Please check out the parenting books by Dr Sears or Our Babies, Ourselves by Meredith Small for good quality parenting advice and leave this book for your recycling!!!!"
2,Very choppy and kind of angry,"I picked this up after reading It Sucked and Then I Cried because I'm a new mom and I've been enjoying the ""Mommy Books."" This book wasn't really worth it for more than $5 though. It's basically a collection of short essays almost all of which I feel was the author complaining about being a Mom and it was a very choppy read. There were some parts that were mildly funny but for the most part, you could hear this stuff if you just went out with a fellow Mommy girlfriend and had a glass of wine (or whine). I also felt that some of her text was polarizing. Moms come in many forms and while one Mom might not do something that another Mom would, I don't really care for any Mom passing judgment on another or making jokes at their expense. This author talked about being a Mom like being back in high school and the way she wrote the book was exactly like that: childish."
1,You lost me at: there's no such thing as love at first sight...,"I was very excited to read this book after reading the great reviews. However, I couldn't even finish the second chapter about how there is no such thing as love at first sight, even with your baby. I absolutely fell in love at first sight with my baby, and I didn't care to read on as she claims that moms who say they fall in love at first sight are either high or lying to themselves. I'm not saying there is a problem if you don't fall in love at first sight, but she's pretty adamant that it's impossible. She's too opinionated for me. I returned it before I even finished the 2nd chapter."
1,Would be great if it actually oscillated,"What a piece of junk. I bought this sprinkler from Home Depot. It was one of the most expensive ones they had, and it looked like it was well built. After a few uses, however, it gets stuck and you have to shake it to get it to start oscillating again. It is not worth any amount of money, certainly not what they are asking."
1,Would not oscilate from the start!,"ORdered a second, after (luckily) having good success with the first. Second one arrived, oscilation was DOA. I am nto sure I will roder a replacement after reading all the simialr comments."
1,"""Heavy Duty?""","Used this about 3 times in my garden, now no oscillating. Avoid this junk at all costs."
1,Very bad sprinkler,"I bought this sprinkler about three weeks ago, it is in the garbage now! I thought when it did not rotate that it might have something hanging it up so, I bought a water filter and added it to the line. That was a waste of money also! The sprinkler would rotate back and forth very well for a few rotations and then it would hang up, I then would pick it up and bump it a time or two and it would work fine for a few rotations and hang up again, then I would start over again. Finally I got tired of staying outside just so the lawn could get watered. Now, I just use a hand spray nozzle until I can get a good sprinkler.I would not recommend this product to anyone, it is a waste of time and your precious money. I like this type of sprinkler if it worked like it was supposed to."
4,"Thoroughly researched, inspirational biography","I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy reading political biographies and especially those who are interested in the 1960's and in learning about RFK. I decided to read this book after first reading An Unfinished Life: John F Kennedy 1917-1963.Before reading this book, I knew very little about RFK. It is a long book, with some parts a little slow going. Beginning with the chapter ""The Brothers: II"", examining the JFK-RFK relationship during the Kennedy administration, I found the book to be totally engrossing. I concur with another reviewer who remarked the book is compartmentalized, and might have read better if told in chronological order. Yet the author's approach may be the most intelligible way to present such detailed examinations of political and social issues of the time.In conclusion, I found this to be a superb biography, thoroughly researched, well written. Truly an inspirational story of a man of integrity and great compassion."
4,From the book,"The author presents recent thinking reflecting early attempts to move beyond restrictive God language, opening up the possibilities of more inclusive ways of praying. The rich experiences of God, distinctive and diverse, are seen through the eyes of many cultures and the women who struggle for justice. Using the figure of Sophia Wisdom as an example, the author shows that there are many still unplumbed images of God to discover. The Introductions in Feminist Theology Series explores various theological topics that challenge patriarchal theology and suggests liberating alternatives. The authors and editors seek to expand the theological discourse by providing reliable guides to the history of thinking, current issues and debates, and possible future developments in feminist theology. The author is a scholar in residence, Sarum College, Salisbury. She is also a visiting professor, University of Southhampton, and Honorary Professor, University of Wales, Lampeter."
2,Feed Poorly through Printer,About 1/3 of the sheets jammed in my printer. Never had issues printing any other type of labels on it. I believe it is due to the easy tear backing on the sheets themselves.
3,"At times useful, but disorganised---read Deligne's SGA 4 1/2 instead","Milne's account of \'etale cohomology is sometimes useful---in that it proves various little lemmata and criteria that come handy in practice---but disorganised the rest of the time. What's more, the proofs are often just sketches of the sort: ""To see this, use the argument of Theorem 3.66 combined with the devissage of SGA 4, exp. XII, Prop. 3.14 to reduce to the case of curves; now the claim follows from my comments on page 45."" (The previous sentence is not a direct quotation from the book, so it might suffer from mild exaggeration on my part.) Furthermore, the book doesn't cover Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures.If trying to learn the theory for the first time, I'd recommend you read Deligne's extremely lucid and concise SGA 4 1/2. As a good exercise for your new-found knowledge, then, try to go through the same author's ``Weil-II'' paper. This should probably serve you better than reading Milne's Etale Cohomology."
5,Yummy!!!!!!!!!!!!,UPS just kindly delivered our croutons and they were great! My children kept eating them AFTER supper :)
2,"Nice idea, can't erase.","My daughter received this for her third birthday from her Grandpa and while it's a great concept and I think she would really like it, it doesn't really work. Erasing each drawing is nearly impossible, and it bothers me enough that I know it will bother her to be unable to erase old drawings and start new. So we're returning it for something else."
2,Look out!,"My child loved this gift, however, the lightbulb went out almost immediately and I cannot find a replacement anywhere!"
3,Not all that deep,"This is a lovely and sturdy pie dish, but the dimensions given are not accurate. It is listed as 3.5 inches deep, but it is only 2 inches deep. If your are looking to purchase a truly deep pie dish, this isn't it!"
2,Too large...,"I loved the colors and design of this navel ring. However, I found that the actual ring was way too large for my navel piercing. My navel piercing isn't very deep, but it also is not too thin. I feel that I've wasted my money on something I'll never use."
1,Couldn't be worse if they actually tried,This is the worst movie I ever seen. The characters are bunch of sterotypes to the extreme. The film makers probaly thought they were being clever but fall short. This movie was not funny nor scary and the characters are beyond stupid. From the terrible beginning which includes a women running around to topless for no reason to the lacklaster ending do yourself a favor don't even netflix this film.
2,lacking...,"While the subject matter of this book describes a gripping poverty that makes any heart sad, the writing faild to get to the point. The images didn't form a coherent message. Shocking pictures of babies in dirty rags and a useless father drinking is pubs while his family starves are stark, but where they go is unclear. McCourt has captured individual moments very well but dosen't develop a story."
2,"Story that needed to be told, but in a better way.","I read this book because everyone I knew was raving about it. I had to force myself to read it. It was a heart-breaking story, but it was SO hard to endure the way in which the story was told. I found the style choppy and completely lacking in flow. I had the feeling that the story was told from a distant stance - which well may have been the case."
3,"Not a masterpiece, but certainly appealing","So much has been said and written about ""Angela's Ashes,"" and much more is to come after the movie is released. Easy and smooth reading, no intellectual effort is required, although some readers are annoyed by the excess emphasis on poverty (rats, lice, diseases, hunger, dirt, etc.) The story reflects the cruel reality of poverty, be it in Ireland or in any other part of the world. It is all viewed from the perspective of a small child and his struggle for survival, his awareness of the distortions between a fanatic Christian environment in which the teachings of love, sharing, respect, are far from his daily reality. The story appeals to our feelings of sorrow for the existence of so much misery in this world, which explains why the book has been so successful. A more demanding and critical reader might find the book lacking in terms of structure, style, and historical depth; all of these compensated by abundant human feeling."
3,So overrated.,"I can't really add more than the other more insightful reviewers have written. The subject matter is appealing, but there are many books like this one, I don't see why this one gained so much attention. McCourt's writing style is annoying and he seems to dwell more on sexual issues than necessary (especially his own masturbation). The sequel to this book was even more disappointing. If you are interested in this type of book, I highly recommend Harry Bernstein's 'The Invissible Wall' which I read after this one (suggested by Amazon) and is excellent, as were the 2 following books, all written while the author was in his 90's."
4,"Excellent book, some mistakes made by McCourt","Angela's Ashes is definately a worthwhile book to read. He takes us through his childhood, good or bad, both perspectives are shown. (Although hardly anything good had happened to him) Sharing his life with us was truly an experience and I admire him for doing so.On the flip side, this book lacked an ending. ""I'm in america""- The end. I think he should have also focused a bit more on his mother Angela as he did entitle the book after her. I also think he was constantly repititive in every chapter, ""Oh my dad drank all his dole money away"", ""We are poor"", ""excitement""I still give this book a 4 star rating because it was a good book, just some flaws that I personally think McCourt could have worked on."
4,The harsh reality makes this book good,"I loved this book because of it's harsh reality of the time period in which it was written. I rooted for the characters and then cursed them if they let me down. It was truly an eye-opening look into the country of Ireland's history although it was a grim look. If you are looking for a happy bright novel this is not it. If you are looking for a true to it's time period no holds-barred novel, I highly recommend this book."
4,A very Special View on Ireland,"I liked McCourt's book for its realism and humor. I have to admit, that I've never been to Ireland. But maybe because of that I hold a certain perspective of how paradiselike a life on the ""Green Island"" may be, of people mainly happy, drinking their guinnes making good music like the Corrs or Clannad. McCourt robs you any illusion of that kind, and shows you a different life in poverty and misery, where even a supposed nationalistic heroism has no place as it doesn't provide any food or human housing either. Written from the perspective of a growing up teenager, who wonders about things happening around, the book never gets into severe a mood but always plays with a fine and sublime sense of humor. This may be nothing for those who cannot stand description of human misery less for those who cannot stand smiling at it. It may even disturbing for those who still want to hold an ideal picture of Ireland. I rather smiled and was delighted."
3,WHAT THE BLOODY FRIGG IS ALL THE FUSS ABOUT???,"I found this book booooringgg! I call it a memoir/fiction.Not only was I distracted by the punctuation (or lack of) I found it too verbose, just endless chatter. There were numerous series of accounts of childhood, with no real substance and cohesiveness!! I fiiiinnalllly finished the endless stories. There appeared to be WAAAAY to much detail in each account. I cannot imagine anyone being able to recount their lives with such filling detail as this book. That's why I refer to it as a memoir/fiction."
2,Not worth the time,"I am amazed that Frank is still alive after suffering through all of the consequences of extreme poverty -- but he definitely takes the easy road at the end of the book. I got so sick of hearing about his self-indulging habits. I don't care if this is an integral part of the male species, I don't want to hear about it over and over again -- that's not why I started reading the book. How did this poverty affect the rest of his life? How did this poverty affect his family relationships later in life? I hoped there was so much more to this story but I was very disappointed. I can't believe that this won a Pulitzer Price. It just goes to shows how the standards have changed."
5,Angela's Ashes: A Memoir --A young reader's view and opinion,"I think that this book, Angela's Ashes: A Memoir, really captures the poverty and depression of the era and place. The way that Frank McCourt begins the book is so direct and imformative, but it still says nothing about certain experiences. It doesn't tell about getting typhoid or the ""knee tremblers"" or of the deaths of his brothers and sister. It doesn't give away what will happen in the book, it is rather a thesis statement for the story. It tells you that the book is about his childhood and how awful it was. It really sets the scene and background.The joys and sorrows of this book, Angela's Ashes, are so realisticly told and described. You feel almost as you are there observing what's happening, staring in the window, standing in the shops in back of them in line, wishing that you could reach out and help and then drifting slowly back to reality."
2,Exceptionally depressing,"I found this book to be very repetitive and depressing. After finishing this, I gave it to my mother to read. She is 66 years old and was born and raised in Galway, Ireland. After reading it, she was furious. She grew up on a farm and said that she NEVER saw the kind of poverty that McCourt was talking about. Her father was NOT a drunk, either. Many people who have read this book apparently think that this is what life was like in Ireland for everyone. My mother had a very happy childhood over there. She ended up coming to America because of the lack of opportunity in her homeland. Today, Ireland is one of the wealthiest nations in the world. I have no doubt that McCourt grew up in poverty, but many Irish people feel that he got carried away with himself in this book. Angela's Ashes won the Pulitzer Prize because it was about poverty, and that's a politically correct issue these days."
1,I was so happy to find out it was not true.,"McCourt is a brilliant writer and on that basis alone this is a worthwhile read even though I always felt it was biased against Irish-Catholicism. Oh, well that's fair game in a memoir. So why one star? The book pretends to be a biography. There is now an overwhelming amount of evidence that Ashes is a fictional novel loosely based on boyhood anxieties. McCourt may have intended this as a literary device but I'm sorry a lie is a lie is a lie."
5,I loved every page of this book from beginning to end.,"I enjoyed this book so much that I had to read parts of it to my husband so we could enjoy it together. McCourt's description of life and his sense of humor were just wonderful. I felt like I was there in every scene. This book should be read by anyone doing family research in Ireland. It will make you appreciate your ancestors for coming here and making it possible for you to have a better life. Also, when you have finished reading this book you will think about America the land of opportunity and how it came true for the McCourt family. I can't say enough about Frank McCourt and his book Angela's Ashes."
2,McCourt suffers much and learns little,"I laughed, I cried, I howled at the wonderful, painful stories of McCourt's childhood in Ireland, and at the end, I threw the book across the room. McCourt shows us how he never seems to have outgrown his adolescent sexual obsessions. After reading for many pages of his exploits, at the end of it all, after McCourt arrives in America, he proclaims it is a great country. Why? Because it brought him freedom and he is able to finally be himself, and leave his suffering and errors of judgment and honesty behind him? No. Because he is able to bed an American married woman--with a priest in the next room--within an hour of his arriving in New York. What a summary there could have been, of learning by mistakes, of appreciating other people, of growth. Instead we are left to assume that McCourt learned nothing, except lying, stealing and adultery are the way to go. No balance. No maturing. No thanks."
4,Sad but Funny,"Although angela's ashes is a really sad book, the author writes everything with a light sense of humor. And as much as he tells us about the hardships of his childhood and how tough life at home was, he doesnt fail to stick in a good anecdote or two about school or him and his brothers. I really enjoyed this book, and i think that the author did a really good job of getting a not so bright story across without making the book a total sob-fest."
1,"Nice Story, terrible writing style","Angela's Ashes was a wonderful read for those of us who care little about long run on sentenses and poor punctuation. At the start of the book one empathises with the young Frank, but as one gets to know him a little better, one grows to dislike the selfish boy. The need to find out what happens next just about encourages the reader to keep reading despite the awful style. The need to keep reading was mainly due to interest in what happened in Limerick having heard first-hand stories from other parts of my home elsewhere in Ireland at that time. I wonder why he ever got a prize for this book! Don't hold this book as your only sample of ""Irish"" writing."
4,Glad that Frank Mc Court got out of Ireland,"I really enjoyed this book, it showed a lot about the poor of Ireland and the Irish men who all had one weakness the drink. It shows a lot about the catholic church and it also make me understand why my relatives were thought of so badly when they came to America. The Irish in the book were poor and relied on the government and the men leave their children and the mothers don't know what to do. I saw my own family in this story, especially my Grandfather. I saw the real Ireland not the land that is told about in fairy tales. Ireland has come a long way and is so much better for it. This is not putting down the Irish this is showing how the survived. I am amazed that the Mc Court family did survive but I am so glad they did we had a wonderful story teller in Frank Mc Court."
5,A Brilliant Book.,I finished Frank McCourts book today and I thoroughly enjoyed it. How those poor people managed to survive is astounding.Frank McCourt has my admiration for his honesty and also his amazing writing talent.I also enjoyed his brother Malacheys book which I read last week. I hope they both give us more.
4,Rising From The Ashes,"I enjoyed the book. It's good to look to the pityou come from. How else can you appreciate whatyou have? Those who criticize this book, must walk the muddy road of poverty, barefoot, to understand. Yes, he had a snotty nose and an empty belly, everyday... that's what poverty's like. To survive the monotony of such dire straits, is true victory. I've been there... I've tasted it...Jeff Read, Seattle, WA"
4,Favorable Review,"Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt, is a superbly crafted story that recounts his ""miserable Irish childhood."" His vivid depictions of poverty and very realistic view of groing up Catholic make this an excellent book for anyone and a must-read for anyone that has ever been to parochial school. I give it an eight on a scale of one to ten."
5,wonderful,This was a great book in written form and even more so in the audio. I believe any book read by the authur gives the correct conintation to the words.
2,Very depressing account of childhood.,"I found this story very depressing, and in fact, did not finish the book. I figured if it was on the best seller list, it had to be good, right? Wrong.It was a little to raw for me to enjoy reading - disturbing actually. The writing itself is great, the subject matter was just rather dismal."
1,Depressing,"After reading Angela's Ashes, I consulted with an Irish bloke friend who said, ""I grew up as a poor child in Ireland as well, but remember he wrote this book to make money"". True!!! While I understood and respected his underprivileged childhood, and admire his recent success, he displayed poor taste when he finished the book up with his sexual exploits. It was so out of place in the world of a child trying to cope with survival. He totally lost it here."
1,This book is not worth all the time that it takes to read!,"I would not recommend this book. It takes too much effort to read and at the end, after all of that effort, you realize that it wasn't worth it..this is one of this author's worst books...i advise you to try some others though and you may find them less challenging to read, and more enjoyable....."
3,The Book Is Not The Issue,"As is often the case, the book is less consequential than the public reaction to it. The latter is far more instructive than the former will ever be."
3,Great find,Found this today at the annual library sale for $1 and now that I have read the reviews on Amazon I am anxious to read it.
2,Me thinks it's m ostly blarney.,"Try as I might I have only been able to get through two chapters, thus I gave it two stars. I'm inclined to think it's mostly blarney that McCourt has given us. He teaches english does he not? I can't comprehend a man havin' powers of recall that he seems to have stretchin' way back into his early three's. I now know that """"TIS"" tis a book I will not be readin""."
4,What an eye-opener!!,"""Angela's Ashes"" is one of the best books i have read in a long time. Athough it may seem like an extremely long book it keeps your interest throughout the whole story. It is written in the best view imaginable, that of a childs. Frank McCourt is a poor boy who moved from New York back to his parents homeland, Ireland. He is the oldest of 7 children, three of them died however. His family is extremely poor and his father is nothing but a raging alcoholic. It is a wonder to me how this poor child made it through his childhood and how could he ever possible find the courage to write about it. Overall, i gave this book four stars because it was a really realistic book. To learn all about his life made me realize how fortunate so many people are. It was an extremely moving book and i think everyone should read it."
4,Rivetting reading,"I could barely put it down except to eat and converse with those who insisted that they be spoken to - a terrible thing when you've just travelled 2000 km just to see your family! There a millions who have shared Frank's experience of family alcoholism, poverty and uninspired, rigid and dehumanising Catholicism (and I thank goodness things have changed - yes, it has), brutal education and grossly insensitive hospitalisation. This story will touch the heart and experience of all who have shared any one of these. That he should grow to maturity, to become a loving father and still be so aware of where he and his family have come from is a miracle. Come to this book and enter a world which we must hope is lost to our young today."
5,An excellent deeply moving book,"This was the best memoir I've read in some time. He crafts the language beautifully and he manages to change the voice as the child grows up, which is quite a feat. It's an immigrant's story, a tale of redemption filled with such wondrous and painful moments that it almost seems unbelievable. But it only feels that way because that reality is so distant for anyone, say, shopping online. I'm grateful to McCourt for conveying what it feels like to be hungry constantly. It's something, that in America at least, or in its well-fed portion, we have forgetten. He lets us remember how the other half lives. Deeply moving."
5,Sonita Bermudez Colombia,"Is a better book that I readed reciently, It's very human, the language used is very common, and real, I almost cry with the of malachy junior, further I love Ireland is the more beatiful country in the world,"
2,You will connect with the main character...,"When most immigrants come to America from Ireland, they don't return. Frank McCourt's family did. After finding conditions in NYC less than desirable, especially when you have an alcoholic father who can't hold down a job, Frankie, who was born in America, and his family return to Ireland. His memoir of a family trying to survive during extreme poverty as he grows up is quite moving. However, for some strange reason, I felt the film, of the same name, did a better job of portraying Frankie's experience to me. Perhaps it had something to do with the author's style, which I sort of disliked. If you don't see the film, then you should read the book. And I really want to see what happens in the sequel, for you did really start to care for young Frankie and want to see if he will make it."
5,I love it!,I loved this book. It's so funny and heart wrenching at the same time. I was 14 when I read it and I found myself getting into trouble in class for reading. It's a must have.
2,"Not a masterpiece, best seller & unworthy of big screen","This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I could not wait to finish reading it and quickly donating it to our local library. I have never started reading a book without completing it, but I did contemplate not finishing this one. The book is too repetitious. Each chapter echoed the previous."
4,GET INTO A CHILD'S MIND!,"Born into a poor Irish Catholic family, Frank grows up in the slums of Manhattan and Limerick facing problems such as a drunk father, family tragedies, consumption and poverty.Although this book gets a little boring sometimes, it is quite exciting cause at any time one wants to know what happens next to Frank and his family.The author Frank McCourt did an excellent job on writing about his childhood and how he went through it.JUST LIVE THE LIFE OF A CHILD THAT FACED PROBLEMS EVERY SINGLE DAY YOURSELF."
5,Exactly what I asked for.,"This book is for my son's Literature class. It came right on time and he's enjoying the class discussions. Although, he would not recommend it to a male teenager for fun reading as he put it."
5,A Beautiful and Sad Story,"This book kept me up all night. I could not let this book go. It made me realize that other parts of the world have similar problems to the ones we see in our part of the world. This book hit home right on the dot. His carefully picked words, his details, his politeness, his innocence, his ambition, all made me want more. I can't wait to read the second part of his memoir. This is an excellent story teller. And, I hope that his writing days are just beginning.Tis'"
3,"Interesting, but not inspiring","While I enjoyed reading this book and found it to be well written, I did not find it inspiring as so many other readers did. I thought that while Frank made it out of Ireland it offered no chance for anyone else. he made it out through luck and good timing, but not through means accessible to others. The entire time he worked for the lady he eventually robbed, he claimed to be ashamed of himself but felt nothing for robbing her? I do not think we should be inspired by a thief. Also, he left his family no money, if he didn't mind stealing money for himself, why couldn't he buy them food? I did enjoy the book though, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a description of Ireland and poverty."
3,McCourt takes part in Irish exploitation.,"In a time where Irish step, Celtic art, traditional irish music or almost anything associated with Ireland is popular, McCourt's book addresses less the various issues of his life than the cultural idiosyncracies that attract mainstream audiences. Like Michael Flatley or The Chietains McCourt has taken a base of Irish culture and Americanized it. His style is so appealing, it is unfortunate he used it in such an unappealing fashion. I sympathize with the McCourt family's plight, but there are so many stories that Mr McCourt could have used his talent to tell without having to take advantage of the current run on ""Irish Culture."""
4,GET INTO A CHILD'S MIND!,"Born into a poor Irish Catholic family, Frank grows up in the slums of Manhattan and Limerick facing problems such as a drunk father, family tragedies, consumption and poverty. Although this book gets a little boring sometimes, it is quite exciting cause at any time one wants to know what happens next to Frank and his family.The author Frank McCourt did an excellent job on writing about his childhood and how he went through it.JUST LIVE THE LIFE OF A CHILD THAT FACED PROBLEMS EVERY SINGLE DAY YOURSELF."
4,Very Good Read,"McCourt potrays a sad yet sometimes humorous account of growing up poor in Ireland. This book paints an accurate picture of what Ireland was like and it's social problems; alcoholism, poverty, and an arrogant and repressive Church."
4,Count your blessings,"It's hard to imagine a life as difficult as one lived by Frank McCourt. The religeous commitment, the poverty, the drunkeness, and above all the squalor. I can't remember reading anything historic that recounts what life was really like 50-60 years ago, much less living it."
2,Is it over yet?,I really must be missing something. I am so bored and just want the book to be finished. Nothing draws me. I was expecting the lifestyle of an Irish child like stories my grandma tells. This is a story of a poor boy with worthless parents. It has little to do with being Irish.
3,Worst Ending,"I truly enjoyed this book... I listened to the audio edition on a road trip I took alone. However, the immoral ending astounded me. People may say ""He tells it like it is,"" but I find the things that the author chooses to emphasize particularly demeaning. To call this book ""Angela's Ashes"" is an insult to his mother.Perhaps someone can clarify for me, but I did not quite understand why the author chose to end this beautiful and poignant story with a jarring and explicit sexual encounter with a married woman, in which he loses any semblance of the penitant attitude he displayed back in Ireland. What is he trying to say about himself? What is he trying to say about America?This book is not appropriate for all ages, as some reviews attest. the movie was rated R for a reason."
2,Wanting more,"I was a bit disappointed with this book. I have seen a lot of Tkid pieces and thought this book was going to be a great compilation, but it was only pretty good. A lot of the text is also very self promoting, so it was not really pleasant to ""read"" any of the text. But the pics are quality."
4,Kindle version hard to read,"After a break of over a decade in C++ programming, I needed a primer to remind me of all the fun I've been missing. This is one of the best written programming books I've come across. 5 stars for the writing.I knock a point off for the kindle version. The code listings are very hard to read. They are small and blurry on my kindle and on my windows kindle reader. They seem to be a picture of the text, as increasing the text size has no effect on them.I actually used a magnifying glass on my screen to figure out some of the text."
2,Only an introductory to C++,This book can be used only as introductory to C++. It is mostly for people that know Java and want to move to C++.
4,Potting bench,"Overall we are happy with this bench, however there were a few issues you might need to be aware of. The bench is easy to assemble but there were two holes not drilled out, not a big deal but you may need some basic tools and a couple of bolts and nuts. I also had to sand the drawer a bit to get it to fit properly, again no big deal, 5 minutes with some 80 grit sand paper and it works perfectly. We also gave it a coat of Olympic clear wood stain to protect it from the weather. Turned out really nice."
2,"Nice idea, poor design","We bought this in preference to the Tupperware ball that - while definitely a fond memory of mine and my wife's - has become incredibly expensive! When the ball arrived it looked great (although the lack of a square is a little puzzling as a fundamental shape) and our little guy loved it. The problem arrived when trying to insert the circle/round piece. One way around it fit just fine; the other, no dice. Taking a closer look we found rough edges on the inside that were snagging against the - poorly - fitted shape. The seams were raised on one side just enough to prevent it dropping in. This is not the kind of negative reinforcement we wanted in this toy as at 15 months old our son's not getting the ""yes that's the right shape, in the right hole but you need to flip it over, jiggle it and then pound it in"" message. Such a slacker ;)Overall, it would have been a great product if the quality control on the line that produced it was up to standard."
4,A great game to teach words,"My kids love this game and so do I. The best thing about this game is that using little words is all right so all ages and vocabulary can play together. IN fact my 8 years old whips my 11 year old all the time.I have also played this with adults and enjoyed it immensely.We did add one rule when playing with my young kids...If you want someone to help you after someone goes out, you can ask and if that person helps you, he gets 5 points. I also limit my vocabulary to words my kids do or should know when playing with them."
5,Quiddler is not a toy!,"We love this card game version of Scrabble! It's fun with a group of six or eight folks, or with just two. Recently we had our second 'Quiddler Party' with eight friends,and had a ball -- again! Good to play with any age who likes to put words together."
3,Good,This game was interesting and fun to play. It was a bit complicated four our 7-year-old; but making the small words was still fun for him. Might be more interesting and competitive among a group of adults.
5,Quiddler,Quiddler is fun for two or more. Educational in that it challanges your vocabulary skills. This game moves along quickly. If you like Scrabble you will like Quiddler. I recommend it.
5,The most creative and versatile word game I have played,Everyone at our house is looking for the dictionary to help find the best word to use the cards we have been dealt or have drawn. Because it is always challenging (and to avoid disputes) we would recommend the Scrabble Dictionary or a good pocket dictionary as a traveling companion to Quiddler.The progressive play of the cards (from 3 to 10 cards) changes the dynamics as you begin each round of play and creates new challenges each turn. Perhaps our family is not as competitive as some but we enjoy helping each player optimize the letters (cards) s/he is caught with after the first player goes down. We can all join in finding the best combinaton of words from each players hand to give him/her the best score with the available cards. It is interesting how many options can be found with the same set of letters... very educational and a lot of fun.I like the solitaire version also... if I have no-one else to play with.
5,Can be as fun as Scattagories,Making up words and being challenged is part of the fun of this game. And not having to go back more than zero points in a hand is very hopeful in playing catchup after a lousy hand. Young and old(er) will enjoy this game.
4,Finally! An engaging game for seniors!,"I've been searching high and low for games/toys for my mother who suffers from bouts of dementia and has some hand-eye coordination issues. This is a ""game"" that she doesn't feel like a 3 year old while playing...and it keeps her mind nimble. It is fun!"
5,Still love it,"I got Quiddler as a gift when I was a little kid, probably over 12 years ago. It's a great game, and I still love to play it! An absolutely fantastic addition to any game collection."
4,Great way to learn to spell,This is a great game to learn how to spell and increase your vocabulary - both adults and kids.
1,What IS the point???,You spend 30 hours playing Skies or Arcadia and over 100 hours on Super Smash Brothers Melee....then get this memory card and transfer the saves to it then go to bed.Come down in the morning and the damned this is corrupt so you have to format it.Play a game....reboot the Gamecube and it is corrupt again.Not worth the money....avoid at ALL costs!
4,Handy!,"I bought this to hold my PDA, accessories book and notes for a class I am taking and it's wonderful. I like to sit back a write on my lap and it's perfect. I wish the plastic part inside would snap down better but it's not a huge problem."
1,Sony - You won't stay on top with this one,"Just like all the other reviews, my Sony CD player stopped working after using it approximately 20 times. The sound is great - but not when it doesn't work. It too has eaten my CDs. I took it to a local shop to repair it. Cost $30 just to investigate and I never got an estimate to fix after 2 months in the shop.What a waste! Don't buy!"
2,"Update, one week later","This unit has already died on me. It wasn't the CD player as I feared, but the cassette player---it just locked up at the end of a tape, which forced it to automatically shut off. So now whenever I turn it on, it turns itself off automatically after about 5 seconds, and my tape is still stuck inside!!!Tomorrow I'm taking this back to the store, will exchange it for another one, hoping this was just a bad apple. Will definitely get the extended replacement service warranty...I'm spooked, now! Never had anything die on me this fast before.Hope they'll at least be able to dislodge my tape, too!"
1,UNDERSTANDING EXPOSURE,"The publication is very well illustrated, with many practical exemples, the text is cleared and concise. It should be recommended for all ages."
5,This is the book I was looking for,"After purchasing many photo books to try to learn more about tricky exposure problems, this is the book that finally solved the mystery for me. There are many examples of situations similar to the ones that gave me fits and I was able to dramatically improve my photography in low light, landscape with infinate depth of field, and many other situations. I am on my second reading and am sure that I will read it many times over, as well as keeping it at close at hand for reference."
2,It's not worth the reading,This book contains the absolutely basics of photography. The basics would fit into 5 pages. The rest is just pretty pictures.
5,Easy to read and understand,It a great guide to improve your pictures. I highly recommend it. It is also full of examples you can use to practice all techniques.
3,Exposure,"The author gives a clear explanation of the importance of different exposure combinations to provide different artistic results. It's fairly basic, but it is a good review with photos that do reflect the text.He uses the term ""Who Cares"" aperture for F8 and F11. His explanation of when to use those apertures is fine, but the term is silly, given that the whole book concentrates on how important making a conscious choice about aperture is."
5,Excellent Teaching,"As a newbie photographer I found this to be by far the best book to teach the basics of how to use an SLR camera. I appreciated most the outstanding illustrations used to explain the basic concepts of ISO, Aperture and shutter speed and there relationship with each other. I also appreciated his explanation of how to meter certain subjects to get superior results. With all the exercises throughout the book along with his explanation of how and why he took certain photos you feel like an expert by the time your finished. With the aid of this one book I have already seen outstanding results in my photographs. Obviously I recommend this book to anyone who is new to photography and wants to have a clear understanding of how to use a camera."
5,Most helpful book I've seen,This book is a treasure troft of advice and expertise. I have ordered the other book Understanding Shutter Speed and I hope it is just as good.
5,Great Primer,"I purchased this book last year just prior to a trip to Ireland, I read it on the plane ride over, then referred to it numerous times over the course of my stay there. My understanding and use of my DSLR camera improved dramatically, and my pictures (not all of them) are testament to that.I just a re-read it while flying to Thailand for vacation as a tune-up on the basics--my best photo's reflect the effects of the principles taught in this book.Bryan Peterson's writing style is clear and concise, his manner is open and approachable, it's like a having a kindly mentor guiding you down the path to understanding rather than an expert droning on about the technical aspects of photography. I'm giving my daughter a DSLR for Christmas, and though she's taken photography classes, I'm purchasing this book to give with the camera.Very good and highly recommended."
2,Had high hopes,"I really had high hopes for this book... But it is really basic, it tries to explain ISO shutter speeds and aperature by giving examples of types of pictures. If you are looking for a beginning photo book, there are far better choices such as, http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0131896091/qid=1119554867/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_ur_1/103-9059832-9557401?v=glance&s;=books&n;=507846I used this book a long time ago, edition 5. It is a far bettter intro to photo book."
4,Pleased with the content.,"As a beginning photographer, I was very pleased with this book. It was recommended by the people at Digital-Photography-School.com. I feel that I will probably refer back to it often."
5,Fantastic book to get you from interested in photography to really understanding it,When I got this book I was someone with a keen interest struggling to go further with my photography. This book helped me understand both the technical and artistic aspects of photography well enough to move to the next level.
5,GREAT BOOK,This book was sugguested at my beinging photography classes.... I can't tell enough people about just how well it is written --- then I purchased Bryan Peterson's other book as well!
2,"way too technical, boring even...","I'm an average amateur in photography but I love to read about it and I readpretty much anything I can get my hands on.I got this book hoping to know more about exposure and paired it up with amanual 50mm lens to practice because I wanted the hole experience.The book fell short... It's way too technical, even to the point when itbecame boring for me to read because i could have well been written in japannesefor all I care, and then the easy to understand parts where the ones that onlysaid ""check your light meter until it says your exposure is fine"" :sMaybe for more experienced photographers this is THE BOOK, but for me it feltshort and I couldn't relate to the author like I have in other books like theones from Lee Frost for example."
5,IQ Matter,I was very impressed with this work. Much improved over some of the other IQ stuff from years back. They are right on the money with this one. Excellent proggressive music that should be heard by the masses! Martin Orford is really becoming a master keyboardist. He plays with Jadis as well as in John Wetton's band. Now with IQ once again he brings all his professionalism to the forefront. After this release I will always buy IQ's music.
2,Not very high,"2 1/2Being a band in this genre named IQ, you would expect some intelligently structured, unlifted material, but the bland pop-prog manages to convey an epic mediocrity and copycat nature above all else."
5,Good stuff,"I will read anything that Orson Scott Card writes. His characters are engaging, his settings imaginative, his insight into the human condition riveting!"
1,Wow! One of the worse books I've ever read...,"After so many years of being one of the biggest fans of Orson Scott Card's ""Ender Series"" I can't believe what a really awful book this is. It's condescending, insulting, and completely unbelieveable. It's really very sad that after I have enjoyed so many of his books that the very last one I read would be so very very BAD."
3,more of same,"This book is basically part two of Shadow of the Hegemon. These two books really can't be taken separately. Though good books, neither of them are quite as good as Ender's Shadow was. If you read the Ender series and liked it, definitely pick up Ender's Shadow. If you really liked Ender's Shadow, then by all means pick up SotH and Shadow Puppets, but if you don't, you're not missing out on anything."
1,Extremely bad from the get go,"I read all the other Ender books in the series so why not this one? The very first thing in the book is Achilles' rescue. I almost stopped reading right there. (It is taxing my limits not to swear or being vulgar right now) I thought that there might be a good explanation for it later on in the book. Nope! Not even close.Remember Peter the genius? Well, it's Peter the special ed student now. I have spend enough time on this book."
2,Is this book written purely for the purpose of bashingChina?,"I usually like Orson Scott Card's book but I was terribly offended by the book Shadow Puppets. Does he have anything nice or at least respectful to say about China? All he does in the book is either make China out as an insensitive tyrannical country on the whole or make fun of Chinese customs, such as those of respecting the elder and speaking humbly, even in a self-deprecating way. But Card really stretches it too far and it's done nothing but make me angry."
3,"Good, but missing that certain something","Card is still my favorite novelist, but his last few books have not been up to his usual level. I enjoy the stories just fine, but there seems to be something missing. I don't have a problem with anything that happens in this book, but it seems a little rushed. It just doesn't have the depth I've come to expect from him over the years, especially in comparison to the earlier Ender series."
3,"Same old, same old?","If you like the previous installments of the Ender's and Shadow's series, you'll have to read this book. However, I find it lacking of the magic that made the others popular. This doesn't make this a terrible book, but the cat-and-mouse game gets pretty old, to the point where it's predictable.I also found it hard to read as a standalone, unlike the other books, the lingo and the people requires familiarity of the series.Nonetheless, this is an excellent addition to the rest of the series, and if you had been following the series, this one actually provides a pretty satisfactory ending - one that was somewhat surprising since there's another book coming. Overall, Card did keep in line with his previous book, and this was more than just a bridge to the end of the series."
1,no1buffyfan,"Have seen this movie before and bought this copy solely to watch it in 3D. It's pretty much your standard B Zombie movie. If you watch it for what it is, it's entertaining. The 3D version has the absolute WORST 3D graphics I have ever seen. The movie is pretty much blurry the entire way through. It's not the glasses or TV (I checked, switched glass and even put in another 3D movie). It's the actual movie itself. I don't recommend wasting the money on the 3D version since you can't enjoy it as the quality is horrendous!"
1,Day Of Dead 3D,I saw this move before on TV and it wasn't bad.But when I found out it was in 3D I just wanted itAfter I received it from Amazon and watched it theonly decent 3D was the Menu the rest of it wasterrible 3D. Now if only they used the samecompany that did the Titanic 3D. Shame!
3,"usual zombie flick, was good",Pretty good. enjoyed the 3d blood spray. typical zombie movie nothing great nor nothing bad. to be expected. the 3d definitely made it more enjoyable to watch.
1,Why Did They Do It?,I seen this movie on DVD when it first come out and it's an OK movie. Good makeup effects and good CGl. I just didn't like the idea of fast zombies crawling upside down on the ceiling. The 3-D version of this film must be the worst 3-D I have ever seen. When will the movie makers stop picking over the dead movie corpses of George Romero's movies? A least NOTLD 3D tried to be original. And it had Sid Haig.
1,DO NOT BUY! RAW IS SO MUCH BETTER,"I give this game a NEGATIVE 2 STARS. The gameplay is slugish and the characters look TOO cartoonish, like a Mr. T cartoon. WWF RAW is much better and I'm sure WWE RAW 2 will be certainly better also when it comes out. AND to make it even WORSE you come out to some generic music, you don't come out to the wrestlers classic theme music. This game is bootleg. PLEASE BUY WWF RAW and/or WWE RAW 2 when it comes out. I'm begging you. Read my reveiw on WWF RAW and HOPEFULLY see why its much better, people say this is better? All you need to do is get the hang of how to play RAW and You'll love it. I admit there is a lack of matches such as ladder matches,TLC matches,Royal Rumble, but this game does not have it either."
1,BUY WWF RAW...,"Please buy WWF RAW because it is a 4 or 5 star game. I'll say 4.3 Stars for WWF RAW because a lack of match variety, but other than that RAW IS GREAT. LEGENDS OF WRESTLING IS [bad] you have to buy moves and wrestlers through earning ""points"" through making so far through different ""levels"" of the game. Not only that THE WRESTLERS DO NOT come out to their classic ENTRANCE MUSIC, they come out to some GENERIC MENU MUSIC... ,WWF RAW is A whole lot better...TRUST ME!"
5,A must-have companion for anyone who loves to read,This is one of the most practical reference books in my home library. I turn to it again and again for plot summaries and information about authors. I also find it useful for pre- (and post-) theater reading. And of course it's a real boon for solving the Sunday Times crossword puzzle.A must-have for anyone who considers themself a reader.
2,Ending was a let down,"This was my second Nevada Barr book - the first I read was Hidden Truth, which I found entertaining and well written. I enjoyed this book up until the last 50 pages or so. I got the feeling that the writer was struggling with a suitable/plausible ending to an otherwise enjoyable story. It dragged on a bit and the final who-done-it & more so - why - felt weak and far fetched for such a big story.I did enjoy the info and data on the NPS, racism and sexism in the south, and the strength of the character. But perhaps the end could have included more info about topics such as did the people behind the alligator incident ever get prosecuted?"
5,Anna Pigeon in the South - Gators & Murder & Men Oh MY!,"This was a great book. Portrayed in the South, Anna is new to the South with lots to learn. In her typical style she accidently stumbles on a murder and the whole book revolves around her solving the mystery in her courageous fumbling style. She battles teenagers, men that don't like women in positions of power, gators and manages to just hedge a little romance too. Again portrays her smartness, persistence, but vulnerability. You will love this one."
2,Not worth the money...,"Although this is the ONLY parchment I use, I don't think that it is worth buying if the shipping cost is going to be more than the actual product -- that is unless you were depserate at the time like I was... :-)"
5,"CD ""You Don'f Bring Me Flowes Anymore""","I ordered the CD ""You Don't Bring Me Flowers Anymore"" and I rated it best, partly because of a recent comment from my daughter (She married in 1965 when she was 16 and he about 23.). She said recently, ""He never brings me floweers any more."" The CD was delivered to their home. After playing it, my daughter called me and said, ""We listened to it together, and he didn't take the hint."" Ah, well, so life goes on LOL Mollie Howard El Paso TX"
2,Misses the mark & there are better books,Try John Neff on Investing instead. Neff has been a money manager for decades and is not a self-promoter.
3,"Good Graphics, Hard to score runs","This game has good graphics and sound, but is difficult to master. It's hard to score runs or control the base runners. I've played several games and have yet to score a run. Either I'm real bad or this game is real hard. I'm sure I'll get better with time, however if you don't have the patience or your too young you might feel you didn't get your money's worth. Overall it's a very well designed game and easy to use, I just wish it wasn't so hard to score. The CPU pitcher never throws balls, but the pitching is easy to control."
4,Great Game!!!,"This should be picked up right now!!! I know the baserunning is a bit bad, but that's basically all of the flops. At the beginning you might think it's imossible to hit , but you just have to get used to it. And the fielding feature is a very to use."
5,First mathematical logic book I truly enjoyed!,"I studied the 1st edition (Blaisdell) of this book from cover to cover in 1985. It was great. The updated Dover edition is just as enjoyable. If you have any passion for the subject at all, get a copy of this book. You can't beat it for an introduction."
2,It's good for graphics but that's about it,"It is so frustrating because you can't work a 2 page spread with the two pages side by side. I've only used this for printing out some clip art and/or sayings and such. And when I've used it for a full page layout, it always leaves a 1/2 inch boarder around the edges of white...I know that's a printer issue but it's still annoying. I would never use it for a full page layout."
2,Exceptionally poor printing,"I don't have much problem with the actual content of the collection - it has what I expected. My problem with the book is it's an exceptionally poor quality print - the book is new and yet the text looks faded and in some cases practically disappeared! Very disappointing. If you can find this cheap and with good print, sure, but I wouldn't purchase online unless you just don't care."
5,You'll crave more,"I was looking for gift ideas for my 5 year old son. He enjoys problem solving games and puzzles-not to mention his love of motorized vehicles. Rush Hour was a perfect fit for him. He'd never seen the game or played before I decided to purchase it. The moment he opened his gift from ""Santa"", it became an appendage. Now my husband is and addict as well! Fabulous game!"
5,great toy,"We bought this toy for our 3.5 year old son, because he really loved it when he saw it in the store. He's been at it all the time after he got it and needed only minimal instructions to start playing. We really appreciated the fact that the difficulty levels were so appropriately designed. My son simply moved from one level to another with great enthusiasm and would never quit playing the game on his own."
