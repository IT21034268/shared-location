5,Very Happy,I've only used the second trimester workout so far. But i'm really happy with it.Easy to follow instruction. And a real nice whole body work out. Teaches you goodbreathing and Kegel. Very please with that as well. Looking forward to the thirdtrimester workout and the and birth workout.
1,Don't Bother,"I absolutely hated this DVD. Denise was overly perky to the point I wanted to throw up. I also did not like she was not pregnant in the video. The workout wasn't that good or motivating. I would never reccomend this to anyone. Go w/ the Tracy Mallet Pilates, it's way better."
4,Keeps you moving.,This was a really great buy I don't feel like the work out was too hard or too easy and it always gives me a boast of energy afterwards.
3,Good video for light exercise,"The exercises are good but I cannot handle Denise Austin's insane perkiness for very long. I always have to watch it first, then go back and mute her annoying commentary while I do the workout. The workout itself is pretty good, though... you can amp it up or tone it down as you see fit. My doctor says anything that bounces your chest is too bouncy for your uterus, so I'm able to modify the routine to fit this rule and still feel like I've done something good for myself."
3,It's only OK for a regular exerciser,"For me, since I was very active and the workout I did before I got pregnant was pretty intensive, this DVD didn't do much for me. I didn't think I got enough workout, and the cardio part is too repetitive---I get bored easily.But again, I am pregnant, and maybe I should take it easy.I do recommend this DVD especially for the pregnant exercisers who used to do light workout and who are not in a very good condition while pregnant.Can I add that if you don't mind how Austin doesn't blink and is annoying, sure~ get it!"
4,Compact 45 Para 12-45 --commander style 1911,"There will be some excess holster with the commander style 45's. I use a Para 12-45(double stack mag) there is around 3/4"" of extra holster. The fit/tension is good."
4,good holster,it fits well grips pants nice. i would have given it 5 stars but it rubs my pistol to the point of rubbing off my bluing
1,really?,This is an awful holster....not only is it incredibly hard to get the gun out (cwp?) It is not really adjustable. The bad guys love this one. And it scratches too much.
3,Pretty tight,"FOBUS usually has good stuff. This is the most basic of the paddle belt clip system. It's OK, I guess. But it is hard to extract the pistol. It came on time and as described."
1,Slow & Troublesome,"This Roxio product has proven to be a real irksome piece of software. While the controls are simple enough, it nevers seems to work without creating at least one ""coaster""! Oh, and dont expect a quick copy; it takes FOREVER to finish. Poor quality seems to be par for the course with Roxio products, unfortunately..."
5,amazing discovery,"I have read The Maker's Diet and its a great book. Once I started reading I could'nt put it down, it taught me things I did not know about my illness GERD. I know now, how to control my illness and thanks to this book I am doing alot better and have lost some wait following the diet. I have also learn alot about God and its creations in this earth, it is a wonderful feeling to get up in the morning and not have that constant pain in my stomach. I recommand this book to anyone having GERD."
2,Common Sense Review,"This book, while making many good points, they are points that are available many other places and the book appears to me to be more of a big commercial for a program and line of products that are out of the financial reach of the majority of the population."
2,"more hype than hope, more hope than health, more money than either","Mr. Rubin's maker did not supply him with the wholesome, widely varied, non-chemically modified, astonishing array of possible food my ""maker"" provided me. But I grew up on an ""organic"" farm (there was no other kind back then ). (City kids don't know what a farm is. They may never have seen a ""real"" vegetable or cow.) His two stars are for surviving despite his apparent efforts to the contrary. I considered only one star because he seems so reluctant to name the maker - who is probably more a figment of his own tentative supposition than [insert deity of your choice]. But the second one is for getting rich with it all anyhow."
5,The obvious choice,$40.00 card vs $60.00 electronic code/auto-renewal? And the card is shipped for free? For that price I can wait a few days for the physical card with the same code.
5,Awesome buy!,This is great and saves you a ton of money. $25 in stores & $12 online? Can't beat it. I will continue to purchase my live cards online from now & on.
5,Xbox live,I love that this is an online code. It makes it so much easier to use when it doesn't have to come via snail mail! :)
5,Xbox live gold,"IF you truly want to experience the full effect of Halo 4 Black ops 2 or any of the new 1st person shooters you need X-box live, the 12 month gold membership saves you about 60 bucks but ordering it through Amazon saves you about 70. If you are going to play on line you should get the year membership and if you get the year membership it should be bought at the lowest price you can. Never pay more for the same quality."
2,I find it stupid I have to pay for XBox Live...,"... Just to watch Netflix, which I also pay for, through my XBox. There are no other useful features of XBox live to me. I don't play online, I just want Netflix streaming. Microsoft sucks."
2,Not sure why I need to pay twice,"Netflix, Hulu Plus, ESPN, HBO and many other streaming services under XBOX LIVE already charges you a monthly fee for subscription. in addition their apps all available for free on almost every TV or streaming box out there so why do I need to pay for XBOX LIVE just to have the privilege to pay for Netflix, HULU etc..?I understand that the online gaming is a unique service to XBOX 360 and that actually justifies a fee. No argument here. however this should be separated from the streaming services because it just doesn't make sense to pay a fee for the option to pay again for a service. Access to the streaming services should be free because I already pay for their subscription."
5,Money Saver!,"Simple review, I bought this membership for ten dollars less then Xbox.com. Once you purchase it, Amazon then gives you a code and you type that in your Xbox account and you are officially a member of Xbox live. Definitely worth it."
5,Incredible! This actually works!!!,"I looked at this item after a friend recommended I take vicious advantage of a 20% discount sale. Being the non-suspicious person I am, I approached this purchase with the naivety of a moth to a candle. The purchase was surprisingly painless and quick as I suspect Amazon wanted to quickly take my money. Suddenly, I received an email and it was from Amazon. Shock! Horror! The email contained a 25 lond code featuring a strange mixture of an alpha-numeric string. The email also instructed me to enter this code at a Microsoft site... I think it was called z-box or something. Not wanting to risk a phishing scam, I pretended to give a friend of mine this strange code as a gift. Him being a gullible person, he quickly entered the code at the Microsoft site. He then got a message that his gold-member has increased by a whole 12 units. Amazing I thought! So the code provided by Amazon actually does something to your gold-member."
3,Terrible Packaging,"Why so much packaging? Next time, I'd probably purchase in a store or through Microsoft so that I don't have all that waste"
5,Awesome deal!,When you need instant access to Xbox live! This is the place with the best deal! I will definitely renew through this site!
5,Xbox live 12 Month gold membership,The information is complete. Everything worked fine and as indicated. 100% recommend this provider.Buy this product was easy and simple. my son is happy to share with their friends online.
1,it was $48 buck last week. Now its $54,"Price went up in one week. Then when I ordered it expecting a code so I could use it they hold up the code to check it for security issue. Trace the darn IP to my state and be done with it, that should be enough. I have over 10 different computers, at work, at school, my mobile device etc etc. Never had a problem before now when I need it for xmas it doesn't work. I probably should just have waited until a day or 2 after xmas and check Craigslist where you can sometime get them for half price."
1,Terrible,The code never worked. I tried it over 10 times and it said invalid every time. This is the biggest scam of all time. I highly reccomend getting the game code in store somewhere else
3,Have to have it to get roster updates on Madden 12/13 = lame!,"If your xbox360 has to contact a 3rd party (such as EA) to get updates (not just game-, then, well, you have to haev XBLive Gold.Horrible tie-in. Best way to get back about it, short of not buying it, is to buy it as cheaply (and reliably) as possible, which is via Amazon.Code worked perfectly. MS doesn't have credit card info on tap to get hacked. Don't have to call and cancel at the end of the 12 months."
4,verifying something.,"I had never had an issue connecting to xbox live before and i still dont have a big issue now, but i keep having to type this code in and change my password now. i am not sure if this product is why but i had no issues before it."
5,The Best,The best deal out there for sure i would recommend this one over any of them and the customer service is the best as well!!
4,it was cheap a must have,Has 3 gamesI got it for like 20-40 I can't remember. But it was worth it great price for 3 games.
5,Definitely worth the price,"$39.99 for a year of Xbox LIVE Gold is definitely worth it, recieved my code instantly and renewed my service all within 2 minutes. Anybody looking to renew and is reluctant to spend the $59.99 with buying on the console itself should look no further."
4,worth the buy,"you get so many features with xbox live including netflix if you pay for it, its the best. plus, buying on amazon saves you ten bucks"
5,Exactly what I needed,For a cheaper price than what the actual live is selling for. Nice to know this is around while I can't capitalize on the cheaper subscriptions.
5,Great price,Exactly what I wanted for christmas and at a lower cost than stores offer. Can't beat this deal anywhere else.
4,Great value,Reading other reviews I had thought I would receive an e-mail with the redemption code but this arrived as a scratch off card through the mail. Not a big problem although next time I'll order it earlier before my Gold membership expires.
4,Kind of went to waste,I still don't agree with this whole subscription ordeal. But whatever they make tons of money off gamers for a bull rap reason. Not really anything to review here....
4,Xbox live 3 months,"Overall this is an essential thing to use for your xbox. It provides use for online capabilities including streaming netflix and multiplayer gaming. I should have gotten the 12 month version of this, but since I am a casual gamer, I tend not to use my xbox as much. Overall if you can find a cheaper price of this item (I've seen black friday go as low as $8) then props to you. If anything use this to access online content and gaming with other people online."
5,download,5 stars for keeping it simple and hassle free. So glad you can just download it straight from Amazon! Will purchase again in near future.
5,what you see is what you get,This is a nice price for the typicial 60$ card. What can I say its not a scam what you see is what you get here. Comes in about 5 days to new York. I recommend this due to the cheap prize
5,xbox live,"xbox live is great,and is always getting better.I use it for live content,movies and music.would recommend to any one with a xbox."
5,What can you really say about this other than...,"... you buy the card, you get the code from the back of it and then you enter the code through your Xbox 360 or online, if you're into that sort of thing. And then after you do that, you get another year of membership added to your Xbox Live account. Normally, a year goes for $59.99. If you can get the card for less, which you usually can if you keep your eyes open, then there goes your reason to buy it. At the end of the day, Xbox Live is worth the relatively low cost."
5,Live,"This is the Best way to get live.. Good Price and quickly received the code, I am very happy with this purchase."
1,Amazon sent me an invalid code,"I cannot believe it!!After redeem through my xbox, I got an error code. Then I chatted with the xbox support team. They said ""The code was redeemed on your profile. However, it does not say what the code was for and there is no gold membership on that profile""Very disappointed!"
1,PREPARE TO WAIT,"Don't order this and expect it to be immediately available. Can take 1-4 hours to provide your code, so if you need it now, buy it from Microsoft!"
2,Ok butt.............,"I have yet to receive my code via email but it seems legit. When i receive it i will update this review based on the buyer, not the product."
5,great!,"although it took about an hour to approve bc of digital processing, i received the code via email and just like that, xbox live was activated! much faster than waiting for the card to ship. Thanks!"
5,Going Digital,Enjoy receiving the online game code as opposed to the gift card style. It's convenient and there is nothing to throw away.
3,You have to wait,Dont purchase if you want to be online right now.... turns out there is a wait up to 4 hours to get on
5,A lifesaver!,"For those times you totally forget to renew your subscription, you'll be up and running in only about 5mins. This was a total gamer lifesaver."
1,Very dissapointed,"I bought these points for my oldest grandson. He had friends over to play XBOX Live. All we got was invalid code when we tried to enter it into his xbox console. Contacted Amazon and got no solutions. Will try to resolve this Mionday or request a refund. Needed to purchase another one, but will not if this is not resolved."
2,Keep cranking price up microsoft,"Only review i can write about this item (which should be free) is, thanks microsoft for making us pay for online gaming ""amenities"", keep cranking price up, well its recession time, worlds largest and richest organization must get more money out of people who are addicted to game."
1,Did not order item!,I did NOT order this item! I did purchased one of this cards a while ago for a friend's son - NOT TO BE RENEWED. As far as I know the card and number have long been discarded. If I can't get the charge reversed I may have to cancel my Amazon account to stop this service from continuing to charge my account! Don't get caught in this trap!!!
1,Don't waste your time!!!,"This will not let you use a gift card balance to purchase. You HAVE to enter a credit card, which I am reluctant to do, so I'm not doing it."
4,"Gets you by, more affordable","Amazon pulls through again with offering a cheaper price then there so called competition. Xbox is already an expensive offering of Microsoft product, have to cut costs somehow, right?"
5,Awesome,Super Cheap and worked great. Ordering and waiting for the card was Five dollars cheaper than getting an activation code.
5,Bought as a gift.,Xbox live has been used in my house for many years now. I always shop for the best deal every year. Amazon came through this year.
2,Playstation better,"Playstation is much better, its completely free. You just pay for the items you need in the Playstation store. Xbox Live is a joke."
5,xbox live,I like the fact that the membership is a lot cheaper than ordering it from xbox. I rarely use the membership to be honest but i like the fact you can get online and watch movies or search or anything you want to do.
5,The Easiest and Cheapest Way,"It doesn't get any easier and cheaper than this. Buy the code,receive it instantly. And on top of that, much cheaper than buying it on Xbox Live."
4,xbox live (12 month membership),A couple minutes to add the card to my subscription and a 10.00 savingsover retail stores. Fast shipping and brand new sealed in package.Everything as advertised.
4,Who doesn't like a great deal,"It's a great deal, and it works the same as any other card, or code. So do like me, and GET IT!"
4,Great easy to download,Great when your kids needs Xbox LIVE immediately and good price. Nothing but good things to say about the transaction.
2,Took aeons to process,"The product itself one couldn't possibly have complaints about, but ""processing"" it took over 4 hours because I opted for the online code. I've purchased plenty of points this way on Amazon and had them instantly available, so I'm unsure what took so long buying Gold time in the same fashion."
3,Great card when on sale,Considering that if you purchase memberships through XBOX online they have a rewards program that give you MS points back monthly this card is only worthwhile when it's on sale. Which was the reason I purchased one and am writing this review.
5,XBOX,These are Christmas presents so they are still new. I have bought this item before and my grandsons love it. Great gift at a great price.
3,Cheaper than expected...,"This is the best price I've seen for 12 month XBox Live cards. It arrived when it should, and though not quicker than just upgrading to Gold through Live, it didn't take long, and it cost less. What else is there to say?"
4,I have enjoyed Xbox live.,"I do think they should have kept the price at $50, but they are adding new content, so I am not going to complain too much. And the fact I never payed over $40 for a card so far, always find them on sale. So for about $3 bucks and some change a month for a year it has been a reliable network, with some good apps to watch Netflix etc."
5,Best way I have found to buy xbox live gold,"It was cheaper than going to a store, and it was a very easy process, simply pay, get code enter code into xbox 360."
5,Xbox Live 3 month gold membership,Got a great deal on this item. wish i could have gotten more for the price. Will be looking for more items like this for xbox.
4,Xbox Live 3 Mo. Membership,"The product was as adverted and worked fine once it got here. However, Amazon shipped it USPS and it took over a week to get here. Pretty slow, particularly since I had to pay over $4.00 for shipping and this procuct can be found several places online where the prduct can be downloaded immediately after submittin payment."
1,xbox live gold a complete rip off for apps only use.,We don't play online games so this is a ripoff. You need to have a gold live membership to use apps that are free to use on every device out there!! We had to get this to be able to finish up using some Microsoft points ... that are now much harder to use now that Microsoft finally allowed stuff in the market place you can buy for cash!! Nice ripoff Microsoft ... hope you sleep well at night ...
5,Worked as promised,Received the Activation code immediately and was able to keep gaming. Also saved 10 bucks so that is always a good thing.
1,DONT DOWNLOAD!!,I never received my xbox live code even after 5 hours from when I placed my order!! I would just buy the actual card and its cheaper than the download that you never get anyway!!!
2,Stupid to pay for this,Bottom line... Stupid to have to pay for this every year. I already have to pay for Internet access and its just another way for microsoft to push stupid fees on to their customers.
5,good deal,What a great deal and I didnt even have to get off the couch. I Love it! Thanks for online codes.
4,hey you need it,"it was on sale ,does what you need is there really any questions on this product ..you know what you are buying"
1,too little too late,"I was suckered into buying the xbox 360 back when the ps3 was a couple hundred dollars more. Ive payed that and more back on xbox live alone. The playstation is just a better console with free multilayer. Why does it cost money? I regret buying the 360 over the ps3. Now that they're equal pricing, there's no excuse to get this piece or."
1,Amazon's shipping policy is terrible,"Because I am not a member of Amazon prime and I chose the free shipping, Amazon delays shipping the item. Most internet companies ship in 1-2 days from receipt of order even with free shipping, therefore I recommend you purchase items from companies other than Amazon."
1,never use amazon deals,"I used amazon deals and they arent very clear on how to redeem the ""codes"" i copied the code and went to the redeem page and did NOT see anywhere to put in the code therefore i did not get the deal I wanted, I ended up paying more than I wanted !!! they need to revamp this code voucher thing!!! I give them an F"
5,great.,What's to say? In paid. I input the code. It works. Pretty cut and dry. Perfect option when Xbox live won't accept a prepaid debit card or if you don't want a revolving charge on your account.
5,Better than buying from Microsoft or In-store,"I previously bought Microsoft Points from Amazon, and now I've bought an Xbox Live Gold subscription. This Amazon service is great. I get my code within seconds and there's no tax. It's also cheaper than buying from Xbox.com or in-store."
4,great price for Microsoft's service,"I will never buy XBL cards in store ever again. Amazon has them for not only cheaper but digitally, so the only wait is how long it takes to type in!"
5,great,bueno muy bueno la comunicacion con el vendedor es muy buena y envia el codigo muy rapido por e-mail estoy muy complasido con este producto y con este vendedor... A++++++
4,xbox gold membership,this worked out to be a great value. i watch a lot of movies so this made it a lot cheaper to see just released movies. the kids love the games.
1,12 Month Xbox Live Gold Membership Card,"I ordered this item to continue with Xbox Live, at the time I ordered this card my Xbox live account was locked out and I was unable to redeem the code at the time I ordered it. When I finally was able to get my account back late last month I tried to input the code and it didn't work. I had sent at least two messages via Amazon.com about the problem with the code and I have yet to recieve a response. Very Disappointing."
5,Easy,Was 35 bucks when I got soooo cheap and easy way better than buying it off Xbox or going to the store
1,Useless to me,"I bought the membership so I could watch Netflix but it will not work with my Hughes net satellite service, so I wasted $50 on this membership that we will never use."
1,Just order the card,"I never received a code for the ""instant download"" and I have been waiting for almost 3 hours. If you need xbox live, just order the card. At least then you would already expect a long wait."
1,on sale 3 days after for 12$ less,I don't game on line this is a Netflix tax by Microsoft. That it is like 30% off Amazon's price. I hate buying this product but amazon normally has the best price.
5,30 minutes and was done,Whole process took about 30 minutes. Smooth and I'm set for 12 months at a discounted price. Be patient if you don't get the code right away.
5,Nice,I had the on-line code for ten dollars less of regular price. Great deal for one-year subscription and the possibility to profit of the on-line gaming characteristics on each game set.
1,Wrong Doing..,"Amazon was always my first stop for XBOX live. But since the announcement of a price increase, Amazon has really let me down. All they are doing is trying to cash in before the price actually increases. The deals on this website were great, but now they are just as greedy as other corporate entities. The price of the subscription has not even rose yet, but Amazon has decided to leave all their loyal customers out to dry."
1,Microsoft's support does not care about their customers.,Be careful and do not make a mistake using this item. I entered the code the same day my subscription was going to expired and it charged me LIVE Gold on my credit card renewing LIVE for two years.I called Microsoft and the only solution provided was to cancel my GOLD subscription and wait for a code that they are supposed to send between 5 to 10 days. It has passed a week already and nothing.This big corporations do what they please with their customers. I wonder if anybody could do anything about it.
5,Worked Like a Charm!,"Code worked with no issues. I still don't understand why the digital code is $20 more than the paper card which is wasteful, costs money to ship & package, etc.. But whatever! I got 12 months of XBOX Live for $35 and I'm quite pleased :)"
5,Great Deal!,"Bought these for my nephews for Christmas, needless to say; they loved them and I saved $20 off the retail price by purchasing them from Amazon! Very pleased!"
4,happy!!!,"they were great, it came in a timely matter, and I was satisfied,would use them again!!!I really appreciated there service"
4,Fimilial Necessity,We use this service constantly. Seems to fill the niche of cable which costs too much. still worth the money.
2,Cheaper elsewhere,For the current price you can find better deals. Watch for it on sale. Buy at the right time and it's a real bargain.
5,Great Deal,"Excellent deal, would purchase again, and again! Caught this during the thanksgiving blackfriday-cyber monday sale. Hope this goes on sale (12.99) again sometime in the near future. Will be on the look out."
3,Reminiscing the 80's Film.,This reminds me of the early Bee Gees music in the 1980's. I have been looking for this movie for more than 20 years. The movie itself is simple & sweet but the background music & songs reminds me of my younger years. The clarity of the DVD is less desirable but can't fault it - surely it was probably copied from a VHS or Betamax tapes. LOL. Still love the musicality of the whole thing.
3,Gruesome batman,This graphic novel is supposed to be the sequel to the famous batman year one but it is just not as gripping. It is way more gruesome and violent and the story is ok. The art can be a little hard to get and the story may have to be read a few times over to be understood.
4,Batman Year Two,Not a bad Batman story. I am not quite sure if it follows in the continuity placed by the comics anymore because of the zero hour storyline but it is a good read nonetheless.
4,Wonderful!,"I say 4 stars only because all things pale just a tad when placed next to the original trilogy. If I could have said 4.9 stars, I would have. As usual, Mr. Bantock is is brilliant self with Alexandria, furthering our love and curiosity when it comes to Griffin & Sabine and dragging us into the mystery of yet another pair of star-crossed souls with Isabella and Matthew. I highly recommend that you read the Griffin & Sabine trilogy first, but definitely continue through this series as well. So far, with The Gryphon and Alexandria, it's fantastic."
5,Excellent Book!,"A fresh approach to Paul in all his human imperfection, without losing his immense influence on the development of the early church. Scroggs is an amazing wordsmith!"
5,Lovely children story,My children and their children have all enjoyed many P J Funnybunny stories. The animation is good and so are P J's adventures
1,Poor Quality,I purchased both the nude and the black hosiery by Leg Avenue. They are both ripped. I wore the nude pair once before they ripped and the black pair three times before they ripped. I would not purchase another pair from this company.
3,"sexy, but not for tall or curvy people","I'm short and on the stout side of average build (5'2"", 145 lbs), and these tights were very... erm... TIGHT on me. Tighter than any of the other tights I own (which is saying something). That wasn't a problem, per se, but they rode down a lot because they weren't made long enough, which drove me a bit nuts. I do NOT have long legs, and am short short short, so I was very surprised by this issue, as it's generally not something I have to worry about! To their credit, they are quite sturdy for nylons, and the cuban foot and backseam are totally sexy. I'll probably wear them again, but I wouldn't buy them again. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone who isn't petite in build and stature."
2,Buy the Book,"I was so jazzed when I saw this at my library. I though wow what a treat. If you want to fall a sleep that is. I was disappointed, but greatful that I did not pay $$. The information is valid, the delivery well, not everyone is a gifted teacher. Or it just takes practice. Get the book, skip the DVD. This DVD should be included w/ the book, not something you pay extra for. I have not read the book, but it probably useful, especially to beginners of good food sense."
2,"Old & dull, but covers the essentials of power boating","This is a voice over video, where the video material is circa 1970 with more up-to-date narration. Thus, the 1998 copyright is misleading.I've rated this video two stars; it is plodding and dull, but it does cover the essentials. Watching this, you'll be reminded of a dusty drivers ed video. Also, they dwell a bit too much on duel engine craft, which I doubt fits with the intended beginner audience. Perhaps this was made pre-oil crisis.The new narration and recent clips on personal watercraft (aka jet-skis) help. But, if you can find a US Power Squadron video instead, get it."
2,"No, sir...","I don't think this is the worst film ever - but it comes close. I think R. Bresson is one of the greatest filmmakers ever - ""The Pickpocet"" is one of my favorite films - Joan of Arc is also very good. I also do love many of the ""artiest"" movies made, like Solaris,Stalker and The mirror by Tarkovskij or the Orpheus movies by Jean Cocteau.But this was simply a disaster. I give it two stars for a partly interesting dialogue. But no - it will not stay with me forever, I hope."
3,"Ok Single, Great B-Sides","Knives Out itself isnt one of the bands strongest singles, but the other 2 tracks more than make up for that fact. Fog is one of the most beautiful and dreamlike tracks to come out of these studio sessions. Worrywort sounds like the the missing piece to the trilogy of keyboard-driven songs (along with everything in its right place and packt like sardines)- has an underwater feel to it. Both B-Sides could easiky have been on Kid A or Amnesiac, as they stand they are better than some of the songs that are on the albums."
1,THIS BOOK STINKS,"I admit that i am a beginner when it comes to car stereo. Since I can build engines I thought that i could figure it out with a little research. This was the wrong book for a novice like myself to purchase! To start with it is too old for todays technology,the photos only confuse you, the diagrams are on different pages than the explanations, and it is too technical for a beginner to understand. The only good part about it is the explanation on building enclosures. Save your money and time by choosing another book."
4,Good balance between methodology and Designer/2000 product,"If you want a step by step guide to conducting a project using Oracle's Designer/2000 product, this book is IT. I was impressed with the practical tips that the authors provide for the preparation before each phase. This book is a good balance between methodology and use of the Designer/2000 product from strategy to code generation"
4,"Eye opening, scathing history","Zinn opened my eyes to a lot of unpleasant American history I wasn't much aware of. Drawing on a ton of facts, he shows that painful social progress usually came about by ordinary Americans going against the grain; people pushing rather than politicians pulling.Zinn pours out historical facts which speak powerfully and scathingly on their own. However, I found a certain ""us vs. them"" theme running through the book, a tactic cults employ to create solidarity (I've been there). I was left with the impression that rich capitalists and capitalism are the evil elements, while the messy masses are mostly good.The book was easy to read, not academic. But I'll read a few other American history books as a college history teacher recommended. He included A People's History on his list.""If your brother sin against you, rebuke him."" (Jesus) Zinn's book is a powerful rebuke to the past and present sins of this country."
4,Like,"I enjoyed reading this and other books written by the author. I also have the CD. Informing,thought provoking and thoughtful too. Thank you."
3,"An Alternative, Non-traditional Narrative of America","Zinn writes a sometimes pessimistic view of American history. His focus is on the non-traditional form of reporting America's past. His viewpoint is essential to historians. His view of history is a reminder of the form of history taught in many liberal arts programs during the turbulent late 60s and early 70s by dissident professors. It's justified, if for no other reason, than its focus. It reads rapidly, passing through the country's history in less than 700 pages. Look carefully for reporting which needs additional research on the reader's part. Overall, a good read."
1,This book...,"Although this book does raise some interesting points, I found it to be just too 'Politically Correct' to recommend. The author picks highly selective events which occured over numerous decades to make a his points. Furthermore, the author used numerous misinterpreted quotes and misrepresented facts to arrive at his conclusions. Great men in our history have been reduced by Zinn to 'evil overlords'-despite the fact that millions have benefitted from their actions (a fact which the author seems to ignore) I was only able to make it to the mid 1800s before I just couldn't take it anymore. And for the record, I'm not an uneducated right winger either. I am a student of American History..."
1,More Distorted History- but from the other side,"This book was written for white upper-middleclass yups who want to feel a tinge of guilt at their wine-tasting parties!!!! I would avoid this book, it is a very biased and one sided version of American History. While this book does not have the ""Might makes Right"" view of many US History texts, it is no less of a distortion. I understand the reason for publishing a US History that does not whitewash the misdeeds throughout the centuries. However, it is equally as distorting to paint virtually every American policy, Business practice, etc. as aimed solely at controlling or abusing ""the masses""..whoever they are. ..."
3,Cut Lip,I have pretty big lips and this is my first double mouthpiece.It protected everything fine but my lips. After a sparing session in which I was punched directly in the face my lips were cut up and swollen from the inside due to it being pinched and pushed through the breathing hole. I don't know if I molded it wrong or double mouthpieces aren't my thing. I think I'm going to stick with a single for now.
1,Not for children,"I bought this thinking I could cut it down and that it would fit my 6 year old son. It does not fit even with cutting it like the instructions say. You're going to have to look for a specific ""childrens"" mouth guard. I'm looking into the Shock Doctor line of guards."
5,AWESOME!!!,"This was a great book. I read it at least six (6) times and it seem to have gotten better each time. I felt like I was at the comedy club when ""Leonard"" was telling his jokes. I could really relate to Shelby because some of the same things happened to me. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Dickey's books in the future. Mr. Dickey please continue to use the gift God gave you."
5,REALISTIC,"ERIC IS AMAZING. HIS HEART IS OF GOLD AND I AM SO GLAD THAT GOD HAS GIVIN HIM THE GIFT HE HAS. HIS BOOKS OPEN MY EYES TO MANY THINGS AND THIS ONE JUST DID IT. LIARS GAME IS SO REALISTIC. I MEAN IT'S SO REAL IT'S UNBELEIVABLE IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. IF YOU WANT A TASTE OF REALITY READ THIS. NOT EVERY RELATIONSHIP IS ROSES AND DAISIES. YOU WILL BE HURT. YOU WILL DO THINGS THAT YOU NEVER IMAGINES BOTH GOOD AND BAD BUT YOUR HUMAN AND IF THE LOVE IS THEIR IT'S ALL WORTH IT. WHEN YOU LOVE YOU WILL HURT AT TIMES AND IT WILL BE HARD. ERIC HAS SMACKED US WITH REALITY. OPEN THIS BOOK, READ IT AND EMBRACE IT. ERIC HAS DONE IT AGAIN. THANK YOU ERIC."
3,GREAT,"GREAT READ, I LIKED THIS BOOK ALOT. BUT WHEN IT GOT TO THE END I WAS MAD BECAUSE I DONT LIKE WHEN BOOKS END STUPID. I ALSO DIDN'T LIKE WHEN SHELBY WENT WITH THE OTHER GUY BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO FACE THE FACTS THAT SHE WAS STILL IN LOVE WOTH TYREL."
3,Pretty good for discussion opening,"Id say this are more of hotel cable sort of sex, not porn but more skin than avg late night cable movie. Good for opening discussions of new and different things you'd like to try in the bedroom, with commentary by psychologist who specialize in sexual relationship counseling."
3,"Okay, but not what I hoped for","Hirao Masaaki became a big name in parts of the US back around 1960. When I found this CD available on Amazon, there was no listing of the contents. So I took a gamble in buying it. I hoped to get his versions of Paul Anka's ""I Love You"" and ""Diana,"" plus Neil Sedaka's ""One Way Ticket"" and some others.The CD arrived, and I found none of these. Disappointing, but I was able to pass the CD on as a gift to a friend who would appreciate it.Hope I someday can get a CD or MP3 downloads that do have the songs I remember and loved."
2,It Could Have Been Better!!!,"This movie had potential, but it was very boring. I've owned this movie for the past two years, but I could never seem to finish it. I loved the creature effects and the look of the classic 50's. San Francisco is soon attacked by a giant radioactive octopus. I wouldn't recommend IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA!!!"
1,UGH!!,"It pains me to say it but this movie stinks.This movie has some good actors but their characters are constantly contradicting themselves or acting like jerks because of an asinine script.I understand that the script-writer was trying to get across the message that women should be treated as equals by making Kenneth Tobey a male chauvinist but she ended up falling for the jerk anyway!!I wasnt convinced that he had changed his ways just because of one line thrown in at the end of the picture.The stop-motion is ok but the monster scenes are too few and far between and the octopus has no personality.Thats an odd thing in a Ray Harryhausen movie.Unless your a Ray Harryhausen completest you dont need this movie in your collection.Buy 20Million Miles To Earth or The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms instead."
4,5 tentacles R better than none!,"Harryhausen at his best... um, early best. Terrific stop-motion animation even tho the monster is more generic than Ray's later crop of character-driven critters like the Cyclops, Ymir and Talos the bronze giant. But the Harryhausen Touch gives even a giant generic quinto-pus (see, Harryhausen charged 'by the arm' and the producers could only afford to pay for 5) quite a bit of personality!"
2,ZZZZ...,"Most B movies are entertaining if nothing else. Unfortunately this movie fails to do that. Expect a long wait to see the whole ""monster"" in this one. If your a Ray Harryhausen fan, I suggest you buy ""20 Million Miles To Earth"" instead."
1,It Came From Beneath the Sea - Colorized Version,This has to be the most worthless DVD I have purchased from Amazon. Both color and black & white versions sound track is out of sync with the video. You can be watching the colorized version and it switches to the b/w version.
3,Lightweight creature feature fun from the fabulous '50s,"A classic B-movie horror flick about an icky, tentacled ocean giant who comes to the surface to wreck havoc on the world of man. Brainiac scientists are called in to help the military, but will they figure out how to stop it in time to save the world? Typical, silly 'Fifties drive-in fodder, with some great, vintage Ray Harryhausen stop-motion animation as the beast from below trashes the San Francisco waterfront and the Golden Gate Bridge. Eeeek!!"
4,Excellent but pricey,"As a licensed massage therapist, I have clients who feel the comforting effects of this ointment much better than another more popular brand. The cream is also much easier to work with since the other brand is a gel. What impresses me the most, however, is the higher concentration of menthol, which is 7%. Wow! I just wish the price wasn't so high as well. (This review regards the 4 oz tube.)"
5,Awesome!,What a great read! Awesome character development and story line. I was sad when it was over. One I will read again and recommend.
3,okay,"This story was actually written in the early 90s (before cell phones) and the author chose not to update it when it came out in ebook form. That part is ok, and the story itself was ok but predictable."
4,good read,I love Chamberlain's writing. Great twist and turns in her stories. Definitely going to read more of her books. Great read.
4,"Secret lives, loved it","The characters were wonderfully described, and the emotional impact each of their thoughts interpreted with such honesty. I will purchase more from this author."
5,Excellent read!,This was my first time reading a Diane Chamberlain book. It grabbed me from the first page and kept me reading. This definitely won't be my last book by her.
3,Surprising,"I was enthralled with most of it, though the ""secret"" I saw coming from a mile away. It was a good read, though."
5,Secret Lives - A Fantastic Read!,"Diane Chamberlain's story telling skillfully laid scene after scene producing strong emotion, tension continually building to surprising endings to the multiple storylines. This is a story that haunted me for days and will have me seeking out more of Diane Chamberlain's works. Very well done!!!"
5,Secret Lives,This is an incredible read and I couldn't put it down. Characters are easy to relate to and the author was able to weave several different story lines into one amazing book. Highly recommend.
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent read! Full of surprises, I could not wait to get back to my reading. It's not your typical fiction, very well written."
3,It's a bit dated,"I think the story is ok, but it feels like a story that's 10 years old - there are references to old technology (when was the last time you saw a young man with headphones and a tape player attached to his belt?). I don't mind reading a re-issue, if I know when it was published. This feels like it was written awhile ago, and that is taking away from my enjoyment."
4,Twists and turns,"This was my first book by this author and boy was I impressed, great character development, great twists and turns. This was a very interesting read."
3,Another man is creating it,"While Boorstin is writing about intellectual history, another man is creating it like nobody else. Read ""Get Real: A Philosophical Adventure in Virtual Reality"", and you'll know the author, Philip Zhai, is actually leading us to create a brand new universe! He convinced me that the combination of virtual reality and teleoperation will enable us to re-create the whole physical world and start a new form of human civilization. After a series of thught experiments and strict logical/philosophical analyses, he demonstrates why artificial intelligence can never replace the human mind but virtual reaity is ontologically equivalent to actual reality. A must-read!"
3,Lopsided Seeking,"The book is interesting but notable for its omission of women. Indicating Socrates' wife was a shrew does not qualify as anything but biased reporting. I might not be too crazy either about a spouse who hangs out talking in the square all day.Seriously, the problem with this book, is that the contribution of half of humanity is not even considered. A strange text in todays' times, and no inspiration for young women finding their way in the world. Incredible."
4,I loved it!,"I really enjoyed this video and thought it demonstrated how easy it is to make some of his recipes. I was especially impressed how he made the anti-cancer soup. I thought why didn't I ever think of throwing whole vegis in my soup? I agree it's not Food Network quality but who the heck cares. Didn't expect either one to be professional tv stars. I thought the video was really informative and most important I can't wait to make some of these healthy, delicious recipes and improve my health!"
1,Disappointed,I didn't really like the DVD or the subject content. I don't think it is a livable way to eat and with economy like it is alot of the foods and eating suggestions are expensive for the everyday person. I was very disappointed in the material overall.
3,its ok,Saw Dr. Fuhrman on PBS so thought I would get this video. Its just ok. Not impressive. It's like one of their kids video taped them cooking in their home kitchen. The camera man must fancy the Dr.'s wife cause he keeps focusing on her instead of showing what they are doing. I'm a visual person so it was a little helpful. Not much money so not a waste. Just can't believe someone would sell something this poorly made. Unprofessional vs amateur quality. Good luck.
4,works for me,"i've been using this product on & off throughout the last 17 yrs. it has helped me keep my weight down. there is a noticeable difference with this product. if you are heavy on carbs, beer, pasta, pizza, i highly recommend you take this before those meals. i am much lighter on my carbs nowadays, so i only have to use this on occasion, but when i was younger i ate much more carbs regularly, pasta, breads, etc, i changed nothing & only began using this product & it helped keep me from gaining carb weight. it wasn't as easy for weight to pile up on me & that was with no exercise or change in diet whatsoever. also i new a woman who drank beer every night after work & had a big beer belly. she began taking this before each beer, changed nothing else, and kept drinking her nightly beer. her belly went down flat after a couple months. she is who recommended this product to me."
3,A Thrilling Story,"Early Thunder was a book about a boy growing up in the brink of the Revolutionary War. It is a very good book and one that you never want to put down. Daniel in the start of the story is a Tory, and in the end he has to make the most important decision of his life, well you will see if you decide to read it... Dr. West, Dan's father marrys a lady and Daniel dose not like her that much, but Sarah loves her!!!!I would give this book 3 stars because it was kind of boring in the begginning(?) and some parts were plain wierd."
4,Three very good movies,"Before David Suchet came along to set the gold-standard for playing Agatha Christie's famous detective, Hercule Poirot, the role was dominated by Peter Ustinov. These three movies (Thirteen at Dinner - 1985, Dead Man's Folly - 1986, and Murder in Three Acts - 1986) are probably the weaker three of the movies he made, and they don't measure up to the intensity that David Suchet brings to the role. But they are nonetheless three very good movies. If you like Hercule Poirot, I do think that you will enjoy these three movies.By the way, a fun point about Thirteen at Dinner is that it has David Suchet playing the part of Inspector Japp!(Review of Agatha Christie Collection featuring Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot)"
3,Not the best Poirot for me,"My wife is a fan of Agatha Christie's stuff, but in my opinion Ustinov is not the best Poirot ever(this probable goes to Suchet)Still, quite enjoyable triple play, but no bonus at all."
2,Peter Ustinov couldn't do a Belgian accent,"These are dry, dry, dry! Peter Ustinov couldn't decide on what was a Belgian accent , and often sounded like he was German, or someone from a Slavic country. Ugh, it was awkward, and boring!"
2,Disappointing,I was expecting the films to be set in the 1930s/1940s instead of the more recent time period.
1,BUYER BEWARE,I purchased one of these mounts and installed a 32 pound LCD TV on the wall. I made sure the mounting screws that were provided in the kit were solid in the wall studs. The TV came crashing down in less than 10 minutes destroying the TV. The mount isn't too bad but the hardware provided is far too small to support the 50 pound weight the manufacturer claims. The screws pulled right out of the wood studs due to their small size and length. I wrote to Amazon and then the manufacturer who would not address this issue.
5,Tori Spelling is wonderful!,"I own every season of 90210...and to be honest was not a Tori (Donna) fan. I have now read all of the books she has written, watched Tori and Dean Inn Love seasons 1 and 2 (which I own). Tori is an amazing woman, hilarious, beautiful, smart, insightful, and extremely personable. I hope she does more. This season was WONDERFUL!!!! It would be fun to see where she is at now."
4,So NoTORIous,I found the episodes really funny. I was familar with the show when it aired on VH-1 but only saw a couple of the episodes. You can watch them over and over and still find them funny. If you are a Tori fan then it is a must have.
2,Lock is Broken!,"The box looks nice but the lock is broken. Therefore, it rends the box useless. I believe this is probably an isolated incident."
4,Loving Sex - SoulMates Secrets 2 DVD Gift Set,"In Living Color professional, instructional video for AA couples; young or seasoned. Really enjoyed seeing a variety of AA couples in realistic settings being loving, sexual, open and desired.Thought the ""on-the-street"" feature was a very good. DVD helps couples open or continue sexual conversations. Enjoyed the gift set, in spite of some stilted acting & scripts the DVD did have good basic information and beautiful shots. Would recommend the gift set. Did not get the instructional manual mentioned in other reviews."
3,Too short & too expensive,"The only complaint I have is that it's too short and too expensive (hence my rating of 3 out of 5). I love the story about Kerick and Nellie but when I visited Ms. Black's web page, I found out that in the near future you can buy all three stories in one book...meaning one price. Bummer for all the Jaid Black fans who bought all three at an outragious price (me included):( Buyer beware, if you want to read this series (very good I might add) PLEASE WAIT UNTIL ""THE DEATH ROW"" 3-IN-1 BOOK."
4,History and Family dynamics = a good reading,"I did not know Mr. Titmarsh wrote novels, and was delighted with Rosie, it is an enchanting story with wonderful locale, well fleshed out characters and I literally fell in and did not come up for air until I had turned the last page. Thank you Mr. Titmarsh for a lovely book, now I am on safari for more of his novels."
5,Excellent Teaching Material,I teach English in a medical magnet program for high school students wanting careers in medicine. This is just the sort of book from which I can pull thought-provoking excerpts. It's perfect for our purposes.
4,Interesting account,"This is an interesting book, which describes medicine at the front line: literally in Bosnia, and almost literally in urban America. It is not a literary classic, but this is not its purpose. I would recommend it to those interested in emergency medicine in particular, and, more generally, in the ways in which people respond to a crisis."
5,Very pleased with Apple,"I love macs, what can I say! They're good, they're pretty, they're reliable. I wouldn't ever get anything else but Apple."
4,a nice guide for fasting,I really enjoyed reading this book. It has been a while since I have bought a book and was unable to put it down. It is a great spiritual guide for healing. The only reason I did not give this book all five stars was due to some confusion I had while reading the book. The author tends to write things in various order so it was hard to write her formula down for fasting. You have to read the book all the way through (you can't simply go to a certain chapter and get all the directions to start the fast). Also she does not make any product recommendations so I am not sure what type of juicer or blender would be good to buy.I must say this book has started my journey of rebirth and is a great buy if you are searching for something to jump start the holistic path of healing.
3,"Nice little MW, but display can only be read at eye level.","Nice little MW oven. Fine for reheating leftovers and popcorn. Nice design except for a really annoying oversight: You can't read the LCD display! When standing all you can see displayed is 88:88. You have to bend down to the level of the microwave to see the clock, time, power setting etc. An odd and irritating oversight for a unit designed to sit on a counter."
3,Wrong dimensions,"The dimensions stated in Amazon are erroneous. The true dimensions are: Unit Dimensions (H x W x D) 11 1/8"" x 19"" x 14 5/16"". Taken from Panasonic's site. Rated it only because Amazon does not provide for comments without rating."
3,Built for midgets or kids.,"If you are going to buy this microwave, I would suggest you DO NOT place this microwave at counter level. The is one major flaw with this microwave; the display can only be read at eye level. If you are standing above this microwave you wont be able to read the screen. The problem of the screen is compounded by the fact that you spin a dial to set the time. Unlike a microwave with a touch pad, you really need to see the display because how do you know that you turned the dial for 25 seconds or 3 minutes? Answer: You have to look at display. Cooking with this microwave requires you to bend over while looking at the display. The dial is a good idea for locations that are fairly dark (where you can't see a normal microwave's touch pad) AND you have this mounted at eye level. As a microwave it works fine (no complaints), but the display is horrible. I am just hoping this microwave breaks soon so I can justify replacing it."
5,Easy to use bread machine,"Since purchasing my Cuisinart CBK-200FR I have made bread nearly every day. I love it! Mine is a remanufactured machine (costing around $50.) and I have not found any flaws in the machine. It works well, making even and well-cooked bread. The recipe book that came with the machine is easy to use and has quite a variety of recipes. I am very impressed and thrilled with my new machine. I look forward to trying to make jam and pizza dough but am having so much fun making bread so, why bother?"
1,"Big, Bulky & Burns The Bread.","I don't know what Cusinart was thinking. I hope the design engineer who designed this machine has since been fired.I bought this exact model BRAND NEW. Used it one time, and back it went.I have several Cusinart appliances. Both new and refurbished. But new or refurbished. This model bread machine, is one Cusinart appliance. I suggest you take a pass on. At any price. Looks great, but thats it."
2,Not very tasty,"I bought this bread machine for just an extra hobby, so we could have good bread with dinner and not waste money on it at the store. Well the light setting still over cooked the bread and bread isn't very tasty. I'm on my third loaf and I'm not very pleased. I don't know much about bread machines but I do know this isn't what I expected and I will more than likely return it. I do agree it looks nice, but doesn't hold up in the cooking department."
1,A very bad book,Econometrics by Peracchi is a very bad book. A big job should be done to improve it.
3,A soft ending....,"Not really the best ending to the series. A ending, with some interesting themes and a OK plot. It moved fast but too new age, life force, crystal science for me. I like philosophy but I like more science fiction with it.Get it used."
3,Helen Hayes as Miss Marple-A Gem,The condition of this DVD was not what I expected but plays well and I love Helen Hayes as Miss Marple. Received it in record time.
5,True to the story.,"The Blair Witch Project leaves you wondering what really happened. This book does the same. What do you see, or is it all your imagination. The story is about a girl who does not understand why an old, recurring dream draws her to Burkittsville to go on a hike to Rustin Parr's house. A few good twists and an awesome look into the past events of Parr's life, if all of it is not just crazy hallucinations. Pick it up...!"
4,so far so good,"I applied this to a runner rug on a hardwood floorSo far I have had no slippage, time will tell how long it holds.I am hoping for at least one year.The product is rather pricey, next time I will look for something less costly"
4,Power & Distance: Seven steps to hitting success,This DVD along with Power & Distance II really gave me a better overview about hitting. I would recommend for it for coaches who don't have a complete understanding of hitting.
4,E-Legalines Software: Constitutional Law (E-Legalines),"I am disappointed that this is the wrong edition of my textbook. I have written asking if there is an updated version, but no reply. The concept is terrific, but it doesn't help if it doesn't fit my text because I then have to try and get it to fit and that's more trouble than it is worth."
2,Difficult to connect...,Am I really the only one who received a pair that didn't fit easily into the connectors? I struggle to connect and disconnect these whenever I pump... Kind of annoying.
5,Sizing is so important,"I rented the Medela Symphony from a local lactation consultant when I had my first child. I think the largest shields she had were 32's so that is what I used. This time around I misplaced them so I ordered these on Amazon. They are wonderful - it makes a huge a difference to have the right fit. If you experience any pain or discomfort from your shields, it's likely you need a bigger size. This is also about the same price as what the LC charged, if not a little cheaper."
1,Disappointed,Don't have much to say about this other than I wish I would not have wasted my money on this. I am very disappointed.
3,Cancun,Purchased primarily as a result of reading warnings regarding jellyfish and swimming in Cancun. Recently returned from trip and the warnings were for naught.
2,same old same old,"I looked this author up on the internet under ""cat mysteries."" Yeah, there's a cat who is as eccentric as the rest of the inhabitants of Empty Creek, Arizona. But the mystery takes second place to the author's need to create a male juvenile paradise where all the women are gorgeous, well-endowed, and willing to strip off their clothes at the drop of a hat, and all the males, however geeky and unattractive they may be, somehow end up with the gorgeous females. Not to say that there aren't humorous parts. The heroine, Penelope gets all the good lines and takes eccentricity to the outer limits. But I've read all of this Mr. Allen's cat books and this is just a rehash of the previous ones. He wrote six of them, ending in 1999, and there's been none since. Probably just as well."
3,Enticing story of friendship -,"I couldn't put this book down. However, my complaint is the self-indulgent writing of Stegner's - he always seems to be winking at himself as he describes certain scenarios, attitudes of characters, etc..It gets to be tiring... and the writing style is totally outdated! Not timeless!"
5,A Keeper,"I don't have a library but if I did, this is one that'd be there for sure. I LOVE this book. I love Stegner anyway but this one touched something in my heart and made it explode. I cried, couldn't help it, I was just reading along and found these tears dropping on the page. The characters are so vivid and true. This is life in middle class America, this is what happens when you're just trying to live and love and work and be a good person. Stegner writes so beautifully and he is sorely missed. And now as I age and pass through the same ages these characters have gone through, I'm finding similar things happening to me for real. I truly hope that the younger generations discover this book, this style of writer, all this Americana in Stegner and others' writings."
4,Graceful Stegner,"This warm, intimate book appeals to many who might find serious fiction too challenging. It is gracefully written, humane, and emotional without being maudlin. It straddles the fine line between greeting card sentiment and real insight without becoming saccharine. Stegner shows here, as in ""Spectator Bird"" and ""Angle of Repose,"" his understanding of the ways couples stay together and navigate the emotional terrain of marriage and friendship."
4,Intimate and Engaging,"""Crossing to Safety"" is a quiet, deeply moving book about life-long friendship. The plot is driven more by the personalities and connections of the characters than by the usual mayhem found in many novels. The idyll of Battell Pond is a picture of life at the end of the depression and a now lost family dynamic that was common then. The feel of the book is intensely intimate and every reader will wish for their own invitation to Battell Pond accompanied by special friends like these."
5,love this author!,"This was one of those books that you want to keep reading. A few slow spots with more verbage than some may like, but worth reading. Storyline of the characters was easy to relate to-relationships between couples vs. individuals."
4,Enlightening Documentary,"Well constructed documentary on the relationships between Asian and Caucasian men.Those interviewed showed insight and intelligence with the topic.Stereotypes are debated, questions are offered up as to why prejudices exist, and conclusions are drawn.An interesting breakdown of the three types of men who are attracted to Asian men, is given.*just plain PHYSICAL attraction*PHYSICAL attraction and the those who know a bit about the culture*those who want to BE Asian!"
1,Where it really counts--ACCURACY--this program fails.,"Whatever else this program gets right (and I'm not sure how much it does), Streets & Trips 2003 contains unacceptably outdated map data. For example, entire freeways in Las Vegas are missing, even though these freeways have existed for several years.S&T 2003 works well for cities like San Francisco and New York, but if you want to map a location that has changed within the last five years or so, the program is worthless."
1,"STOP...!!! DON'T BUY IT...!!! I repeat, DON'T BUY IT...!!!","Microsoft has really screwed up with this 2003 edition of Streets and Trips...!!! All of the map information is OLD and OUTDATED. I've been a loyal customer of Streets and Trips since the 1998 version and this is the worst one by far. In Elizabethtown, KY, you'll find streets missing (Strawberry Alley), airports in the wrong place (Addington Field), cities in the wrong place (Fort Knox, KY), roads mis-named (highway 62 west), outdated airports (KSDF -- Louisville, KY) and the problems go on and on here in this one little county in Kentucky. This is a horrible effort littered with outrageous flaws over previous versions of this program. DON'T Buy IT!"
3,2003? - Not!,"I am disappointed that certain highways and a bridge I have been driving on since 2002 do not appear in this version. Further, no dotted lines exist to indicate contruction or planning. So if you need an up-to-date road map, this is not for you. For my use, my Microsoft Streets 98 is as good. Credit the 2003 version with improved eye appeal."
3,Ho Hum,I have been upgrading annually for several years. I don't see much new in here that is worth the money.
5,Great Sandal,I have heard many times that Merrell is the most comfortable shoe for walking and standing for long periods. Nurses seem to favor them over other shoes so I decided to try a pair. I have no regrets. These sandals are so comfortable and easy to wear. I do not have any heel pain while wearing them plus they are nice looking shoes. Thanks for the good pricing Amazon.
1,The ilo 256mb mp3 player w/fm tuner!!!,"My parents bought this item for my little bro. When he bought his next one he passed it on to me. After about a month the earphone jack started missing on the left side, then the contrast started going on it I had to retune the fm tuner everytime i replaced the battery. Then the LCD screen blew up (bled) like what happens to a severly hot cell phone touch screen as I have experienced many times. Anyway this item I think works best still new in the box, that is if there are anymore like that out there. The buttons are great for smaller fingers, I had to constintly use the very tip of my fingers and I have man hands to work the up/down left/right and center button, and the tuning is very very tedious I agree. Don't buy this item if you can buy a better(more expensive one)."
3,Started on fire then simmered down,C. Camps gift for detail is amazing. I envisioned myself in the book. Her characters are easily identifiable. However in the middle of the story there was a lot going on. The point of view was switched and at times hard to follow. The heroine although was strong was a bit naive...I suppose that was her charm. The interaction between the english and american characters were very interesting... very pride and prejudice like. At the end the twist was exciting. Although I have to admit Leona was my favorite character. Over all very sexy story!
2,Nasty hero,Couldn't get into this book the hero was just nasty. His emotions annoyed me he was just to arrogant. I started skipping pages when they got into describing how he felt. I generaly enjoy Candace Camps books just not this one.
2,Save your money--totally unnecessary,"I am not saying that this book does not have some strengths; I am saying there is nothing unique about it and that it is totally unnecssary for your collection. Stick to books like ""The Art of Attack"" or ""Attacking Technique"" by Crouch, and go through games by Kasparov (his books ""New World Chess Champion,"" ""London-Leningrad"" and ""The Test of Time"" are ten times more valuable than this book). This book by Christiansen will not stand the test of time, as there is nothing unique or noteworthy about it."
3,Bradford Washburn: Mountain Photography,I was looking for something different. The photographs are beautiful but they are mostly not of the mountain in which I was interested.
4,Ronny's best album by far,"I have all of Ronny's albums, and for me, this is the best. I think that Ronny differs from the rest of the catz in this smooth jazz guitar genre, because he has more of a Hip-hop streets thing going on, particular on this album. I believe that this was the last album to have this appeal, as future offerings, like After 8, and at Last seem to be going for the romantic lush ting. If you are just starting to get into Ronny, and are wondering where to start, you could start from here and work your way backward.I know as people get older their taste changes, and Ronny is well entitled to go in another direction, but he risks losing hiscore fan base."
3,Eh....,"I am a Ronny Jordan F-A-N!!! However, certain tracks on this album left me scratching my head, specifically tracks 6 & 10. His playing is ALWAYS ON POINT, but I could have done without all the yammering on those two tracks. If you are a fan of Mr. Jordan, ""have at it"". If you are new to him, try his first three before you dive into this album. He is a wonderfully funky artist and I can't wait to see what he does next."
2,Big disappointment,I found the book boring. I can't see how anyone that is not in the business of developing software could find it interesting. However I am in the business of developing software and I still thought that it was boring.
2,Too Many Asides,"There were so many boxes with extra content that interrupted the main flow of the book that my ADHD couldn't take it. I would try to read the main text of the chapter, but so many extra boxes demanded to be read that broke it up and killed the flow. My classmates all complained about this text, too. It has a lot of useful information that will become quickly dated, but it's too cluttered and chaotic."
1,Opinionated nonsense,"This book should have been entitled ""Everyon'es after Dr. Laura and I am going to tell you why.""She rambles on and on through the book about Dr. Laura. Though I have no opinion of the woman, there are several other routes Bruce could have taken, but she kept with the Dr. Laura option.She does make several key points, but she never solidifies them. They are only opinions and they remain as such. She offers absolutely no solid evidence on why she thinks her viewpoint is right. Only opinions that are slanderous and also libelous.As a newspaper reporter, I found myself seeing how much she doesn't know about the media, though she tries to come off as a self-imposed expert. I also have the feeling that she missed the mark on several other issues as well.Not a very well-developed book. Really it's just rambling."
2,"OK, but some crazy ideas","This book was OK, but not great. Tammy Bruce speaks the truth about mind control and the media hype. We are now being judged on our opinions and not our actions. However, the way she has written the book does not do it justice. In this book and earlier books she makes statements such as liberals and PC people think child sex is OK and gays want to ctach AIDS as some mark of respect? Sure there may be some loonies out there, but most of the left PC are not this crazy. By including these far out examples it makes the rest of the examples less believable"
5,"Storage: best value, best quality, best results","Versatile, no odors, no stains, and made in the USA! Pyrex containers are an excellent value! They do it all and last forever. Heavy, hard to chip glass and a quality, vented lid for the microwave. Take that frozen casserole, slap it into the microwave, or, remove the lid and put it in a hot oven. No problem. Lids can get brittle if microwaved, so I use a sheet of parchment paper instead. (Or set aside ONE lid for microwaving.) So long plastic!"
1,Too bad we can't rate this with a ZERO.,A part of me has died after reading this book. How anyone would let a pen into these two people's hands totally blows my mind.
4,A Britney Spears Fan Book by Chelsea Trzcinski,this book is really a book for the britney fans if you have a major crush on britney this is a good book for you to read. what made me want to read this book is i went to saint louis missori and i saw this book and wanted it so bad that i had to buy this book.
1,I would like a no star rating! Stay away from this book,"This book is just pure nonsence, I completely agree with the person wondering how someone could let these women pen a book. What were they thinking?"
2,Who told Britney she could write?,"... The story itself is sugarcoated, sterotypical, and unoriginal. The country girl is a poor redneck with big dreams. The rich girl, Ditz, is materialistic and unloved/ignored by her snobbish parents. The writing style is horrible. There's barely any flow between sentences and it's really awkward at times. This story is definitely not one to read if you can't sort things out. Too many skipping from one idea to another than I would have liked.Recommended reading for those with nothing better to do and Britney fans. You'll probably find more inspiration from a ""Behind The Music"" episode."
2,Not the exactly the best book,"The story was simple and little boring.And the authors writing, not the best. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Brittany is a great singer but not a great writer."
3,A Mother's Love,Obviously they tried. End of sentence. Yes I picked this book out of the library cuz of Brit even though I am not a preferable fan. It was good. I mean she isnt too old yet and its plot is a little bland it drages on and on and I found myself a bit bored..... I still thought it was really good and cute thoguh
4,Pretty good,"I wouldn't say that this book is boring or fabulous, it's just fine. Although i'm a huge fan of Britney, and i used to say that everything about her is fabulous, but this book is not really interesting and it's a pretty short story, you can finish it in 2-3 days. You many consider buy STAGES instead of this, STAGES is 10 times better than A MOTHER'S GIFT!!"
3,Sniffy The Virtual Rat 2.O ( with CD-ROM),"I Ordered this product with the presentation of being NEW! When in fact it wasnt new the CD-ROM was scratched pretty severely and already registered to someone else. I did clean the CD-ROM it so far it okay will not know full extent of usability till I can sit down actually complete the lab on it! When it states NEW I Would EXPECT NEW. Unsatified may have to repurchase product due to damage CD-ROM! I wasted my time and money with this purchase! It will cost me almost double, than if I would of just paid a few dollars more for the full price one! It times like this make me avoid purchases like this! I don't have time to deal with this issue! So I will just have to deal with my losses! Will not purchase this way again!"
1,Broke almost instantly,"Wish I had looked at reviews for it before I purchased. Save your money and buy a different one. Just stopped working after a month or so of use, conveniently just after the return period."
1,stopped working after 2 weeks,"Had to return. Stopped working after two weeks. Also, it wasn't very powerful. Had to grind the coffee much longer than I did with my previous grinder (KitchenAid model which was discontinued)."
3,It works but could be better,Bought this model coffee grinder as a replacement for a similar type after the blade broke. Bought this mostly because the price was right and could use my Amex points on it but also took into consideration the user reviews. This was a replacement of a Hamilton Beach model with the same type of blade. This model grinds the beans but so far it's hard to get a really fine grind on it plus you have to hold the button down to operate the grinder. The HB model had several automatic grind settings and did a fairly nice job of going from a decent coarse grind for a french press down to a fine grind for a stronger brew. LIke I said this works but once it goes south I don't think I'll be buying another one.
3,"Good at grinding, but two design flaws keep me from buying another","First off, this grinds coffee well. The coffee is never burned and it does a good job keeping the grounds fairly even. However, the base, which is used for wrapping the cord up, broke off when I set it down on the table in its second year of use. Four years after that, the cord started fraying badly where it came out of the bottom, since the base was no longer there to protect it."
3,Capresso Cool Grind,I am finding that it takes much longer to grind coffee w/ this grinder than with my old Krups. The capacity is larger but taxes the ability of the grinder. Does great for French Press coffee!
4,Justice via Hank Anlaf,"A fast read, compelling for the author's breadth of knowledge of faraway places as well as ways to assassinate the purveyors of evil. Especially notable for Hank's loyalty to his fallen comrade, Stan Bauer, and a rescued gypsy girl. Also notable is the fact that the book has no editorial errors!"
3,Fake but a decent read.,This book is a decent read but is sold as being a real tail and it definitely is not. There are people out there who do nasty things to preserve our way of life but you will never meet them or hear about them and they definitely do not publish books about their exploits. If you can get past that then its not a bad read but there are other books out there that are better.
2,An interesting book.,"This is an interesting compilation of apocryphal books.Every book has a short,but helpful Introduction.There are a handful of books that stand out from the rest for me.The General Epistle of Barnabas.""This Epistle lays a greater claim to canonical authority than most others.""May be the best book included.The Gospel of Nicodemus.Formerly called the ""Acts of Pontius Pilate"",this book is believed a forgery.It is an entertaining read about Christ's trial,crucifixion and some of the events surrounding it.The Shepherd of Hermas.The origin of this book is known. It has wisdom and is a useful book.The Secrets of Enoch is included in this book.This is the Slavonic version which I would rate lower than the Ethiopic version.This collection runs the gamut.You will find gnostic writings,legitimate early church age writings,and bizarre fiction.If you are interested in literature from that age or gnosticism,this book will be of more value to you."
3,"You get, what you pay for.","The buying and shipping process was great, the product not so much. The Shofar is not accurately portrayed in the picture,the Shofar pictured is a black and polished ram horn, and the one I got was natural and polished ivory white. It is a very basic Shofar. Mine did come in at 12 inches so the measurement is accurate. It also came with a cut on the top of the Shofar, that looks like it was a manufacture error. I was hesitant about buying a Shofar online, and I'm even more hesitant now."
3,purse light review,"Since the purse light is black, it is hard to find the purse light to turn on, even though I have it clipped in a convenient spot! It is somewhat helpful once I find it."
4,Filtered Water Tips,"We just purchased this Brita sink filter although we also have the Brita pitcher. I find it more convenient (especially cold winter water) than refilling the pitcher so often . So far it works great! A bit of advice to those whose filters clog very fast. I am in the home improvement business and strongly recommend getting a ""whole house filter"" ( I have one ) to filter the water before it gets to your hot water heater, clothes washer, and everything else affected by contaminents in most water systems. It should make your sink filter last longer."
2,Plastic is as plastic does,"As everyone else has been saying: great water and cheap plastic faucet mounting. You touch it to swing the faucet out of the way, it falls off. You bump it while washing dishes (inevitable) it falls off. What I don't understand is why Brita simply can't use a metal connector, which would solve the entire problem. Too cheap I guess. I'd rather pay an extra $10 - $20 and have the thing usable."
2,"BRITA SINK FILTER, JULY 2002","MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN ABOUT THE SAME AS 2 OTHER REVIEWERS, WORKED GREAT AT FIRST , NOT EVEN A YEAR, AND THEN AS THE UNIT LEANS AWAY FROM THE FAUCETT? THE LEAK STARTS TO INCREASE.ITS USELESS. THE PROBLEM LIES IN THE RING CONNECTION TO THE FILTER NOT TO THE FAUCETT. I WILL TRY TO GET A REPLACEMENT AS THE RING PART BROKE WHILE I TRIED TO TO TIGHTEN THE UNIT. HOPE THIS HELPS."
4,ANOTHER GREAT TEXAS SONGWRITER,"After hearing this cd the first time, I felt a little ho hum about it. But just like all of Escovedo's past albums, the second and third listens proved to be the winner. There are a few songs here that naturally jump out at you, like RHAPSODY, VELVET GUITAR, AND CASTANETS. All of which have a heavier rock beat to them than the rest of the album. But the songs that really sneak up on you and demand repeated listenings is the album opener WAVE. ACROSS THE RIVER, which has some very contagious acoustic guitar lines. And AS I FALL, which features some nice cello work and backup vocals courtesy of Ryan Adams of Whiskeytown. I haven't had this album for very long, but the more spins it gets, the more stars it accumulates. Right now it's up to 4, and it's not leaving my cd changer anytime soon. Indulge yourself with this one, and discover some true Texas songwriting talent."
4,Awesome book - Awesome Author,Martin Popoff is the quintessential rock and roll afficianado. He's done it again with another great book. His style of writing is extremely entertaining with a lot of music knowledge. Martin is the Chris Berman of rock and roll with his word play.I love his books. Another book I just picked up that I totally enjoyed was Rock and Roll War Stories by Gordon G.G. Gebert. If you enjoy Popoff's writing you will surely enjoy Gebert's book too.Keep up the great work. The Top 500 Heavy Metal Songs of All Timeby Martin Popoff is on my shelf to stay!
4,"You know when someone throws a pretend punch in a movie and stops an inch short of the face, and the person doesn't blink..?","You know what I mean? Someone on TV or in a movie throws a punch but stops short of the face, because they were just trying to make the other person flinch? But the person doesn't flinch, so the move backfires? That looks cool, but it DOESN'T happen in real life.What am I going on about? Well, my analogy sums up how I feel about this book. It's good - some great parts, in fact. But it's a bit too unflinching to be taken too seriously. And without giving too much away to those of you who are deciding whether to buy it or not, the 'infiltration' is too much of a cop out. Hardened gangster fooled by treadmill expert? Hmmmm...But it was a good read. It's how alpha-male characters should be and you'll walk with a bounce in your step and a steely glint in your eye for the days between this as your bed-time reading."
3,Carbon particles,"It seems to me that after the pitcher fills, there are quite a few carbon particles. I wipe them out with a paper towel but I'm wondering if something might be wrong with my pitcher. If not, maybe it's an indication that the pitcher is working really well because it's not accepting the carbon particles."
3,Could have been better,"Looks like its working the way it is advertised, but some times the crystals from filter are seen on the top and bottom of the pitcher, which makes us thinks if it is really working."
4,Can't go wrong with Brita,"I love my Brita filter. Of course, like everyone else I'm not thrilled about how much it ultimately costs when I have to pay for refills (like how much this will add up to in brita expenses by the end of the year), but I live in Los Angeles people. So if you're a desert inhabitor like myself then a brita filter is pretty much a necessity. Only thing about this model that I have to point out is that it is just big enough for someone single or even a couple, but definitely get a bigger one for a family or 4+. Brought this for a picnic one day and it was emptied out very quickly."
4,Does what I wanted it to do,"Got this filter pitcher for my coffee brewing. Works good, and easy to fill, but don't overfill the pre-filter reservoir it will pour out the lid when not exactly level. Keep it filled because it works by gravity anyway, and slows down even further as the water levels equilibrate...as expected. Nice design, fits in my fridge fine...its about 0.25 inches taller than a 1-gallon milk jug."
5,No Complaints Yet,"I really enjoy this pitcher. I bought it after a three-week visit with friends (including many refills) who have one, and thought the water tasted great. It's a cost-effective option to avoid bottled water. The one thing I will say against it is that set-up takes a little while: the instructions say to soak the filter for fifteen minutes and rinse, and wash the pitcher, lid, and insert; after installing the filter, fill it twice and discard both fills (or use it on plants). The device filters slowly, and the pitcher takes at least two fills of the white reservoir-insert. The fill-twice-and-drain process is something you'll do with every new filter, but it's a small issue because of the 40-gallon life of each filter. I will update this post if anything of note comes up."
5,good buy,Good product. I'm using it to refill my Keurig and it's small enough to sit on the counter. Lid does not fall off.
4,Just wish I had purchased a bigger pitcher...,"I have been using Brita pitchers for years now and I just purchased the Atlantis Model. It works great. I like the fact that it does NOT have one of these electronic filter changer reminders because I like to be able to wash the pitcher and lid in the dish washer. The only downside for me with this product is that the capacity is lower than I would like, its 6 cups. I wanted to buy the big deluxe model but it was not available at that time. In the end I would recommend this product."
1,Water tastes the same,I have tried this product with two different types of water and it tasted the same. It is just an expensive jar.
3,works fine,"This is my third Brita pitcher, but it may be my last. They all worked fine, but this particular model is a little awkward. They made the ""reservoir"" large so you don't have to refill it that often. That makes it a little top-heavy until the water filters through."
3,Just Okay -carbon filter leaks into the water,"I did not get this pitcher from here, but mine just liked this always leaked the grey carbon from the bottom. I did not like that. I will not get this again. I have contemplate getting Pur, Zero, Clear20."
3,The top just falls off. A lot.,"Brita - you have lost another long-time customer.I hate the lid design, and have discarded the new pitcher within weeks.This pitcher has drenched my kitchen surfaces more than once, and the lid falls off most of the time.Unfortunately, water and toasters do not mix - I drenched the toaster when the lid popped off and had to throw them both away. I have bought Brita for many years, but never again - one dangerous product is enough for this consumer to try the competition. :(I will buy a larger replacement pitcher, as this does not quite have the capacity I need. I am a single user, so this would not work well for two or more users. This is a personal decision, not a fault of Brita.Three stars because of a long-term love affair with Brita's past successes, and the desire to be read seriously"
5,good pitcher!,this pitcher together with the brita filters works great! also the price is not very high. I like it. It works for 2 people needs.
3,GOOD WESTERN HERO-TO MUCH SEX!,"Lou Prophet shoots a man over a card game. Tht other man drew first and Prophet had no choice. The problem is it was the son of Gerald Loomis. Loomis is a big wheel, he is used to haveing his way and doing what ever he wants to do. He is now after Prophet. Lou gets wounded and is saved by Layla Carr, who gets him back to health. Lou knows he can't run as Loomis will follow him where ever he goes. He takes the fight to Loomis. He weaves and hides and fights Loomis and his twenty hands. There is much action and the book moves quickly. I did not like the sex part. Thats not what I read western for but I guess it helps to sell books. Lou reminds me a lttle of Smoke Jensen with the way he takes on the twenty men. Other than the man woman part it rates a five."
3,"Light read, a book to kill the time...","First, I wish the author had some Japanese-speaking proof reader; he often got the names wrong and some details were incorrect with no room for argument. The way he portrates the country is sometimes fair but most of the times condescendingly arrogant. That being said, the author did some homework and sometimes witty and funny. I borrowed this book from a friend who got it from another friend and neither I nor my friends don't like the ending."
4,Good not perfect,I own a pair of these boots I bought at a army navy outlet. They have their good points being made in America and they are overall well made. One complain it the tounge of the boot is of a flimsy leather and falls down in the boot and that is kinda spotty I always have to fix it by pulling on the tounge. Other than that they are ok I like the soles the lug pattern is the best for hiking and I like to look. The aforementioned problem is my only reason I'm giving this boot a 4 star
2,Short,these are pretty short u should probably mention that one the page before i buy it. How bout u send me some ones 180 ones
5,this is a set of wraps with both a right and a left hand wrap,"There isn't much to be said about these wraps-they are cute and functional-gotta love that! The main reason I'm posting this is to clarify something that the product description leaves vague: this item contains both a right and a left wrap. When I placed my order I wasn't sure so I ordered two. I'd never had to return any merchandise to Amazon in the past so I was pretty shocked at the cost, luckily I found a woman at my gym who bought the second, untouched set so I didn't end up losing money on this deal."
4,Good for beginners,"The wraps are simple. They're not very long in length so if you have large hands, you may not be able to wrap them fully. But for the price, they're a good deal if you're just looking to wrap them for fitness."
1,ORDER NEVER RECIEVED.,"To whome it may concern,I never recieved my order that I placed for the everlast hand wraps. I'm not sure what to do about this, or who to complain to. My account was definitely charged, and i have no product to show for it. Please advise.sincerely,Caitlin Waltzer"
2,not work it`,"construction was s*** bought 3 pairs, the velcro was stictched on backwards on two of the wraps--two separate ones! shoddy, pos constructon, the threads started to wear open after minimal use"
3,too short,"This is my first hand wraps.I just begin to practice punching and I don't know what is a good hand wrap.In my opinion, this one is too short because it wrap my hand only one or two layers.I think it's not enough to protect my hand.However, I have been using it for a year and my hand is still fine.I will buy another one which is longer than this one soon."
5,Great for the price,I have 4 year of experience training MMA and Kung fu and this Wrap are Awesome for just a few dollars an believe me 108 inches is enough for an amateur Boxer unless you like to mummify your hands
3,A disappointment,"I'm glad other readers enjoyed this book, because I was quite disappointed in it. I really liked ""The Dante Club"" and I enjoy reading books about Edgar Allan Poe or with Poe as a character.I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, ""The Poe Shadow"" just never got all that interesting to me. I didn't find the ""mystery"" to be that compelling and the characters just never fully engaged my interest. It seemed like not much really happened in this book and I have to admit I was getting anxious to finish it, not so much to see how it ended as because I wanted to start reading something else. Like I said, having enjoyed the author's previous novel so much, and being interested in the subject matter, I was sure I would like this. In the end, though, I found it to be rather tedious."
3,Maybe familiarity breeds contempt,"I enjoyed the novelty of The Dante Club immensely, and there's no question that Pearl is a capable writer. But I was disappointed by The Poe Shadow. It's not as tightly plotted as The Dante Club, and ultimately it's less compelling; the interrelationships between classic literary texts and Pearl's narrative are less complex, and (perhaps because we're more familiar with it) the mythology surrounding Poe's life and death seems more intrusive than the compelling characterizations of literary figures in The Dante Club. And I felt like the narrative was unconvincingly convoluted in the name of creating mystery.That said, there's plenty to enjoy about The Poe Shadow, and I'm willing to bet that some Poe fans might prefer it to the earlier novel. The time and money I invested in reading The Poe Shadow wasn't wasted, but I had hoped for a somewhat greater return."
2,An Excrutiatingly Slow Read,"This novel was an extremely slow read. I can finish a book in 3-7 days but this book took me at least 3 months. The topic of the death of Edgar Poe was interesting, yet, the interest failed as the story was so slow to unfold. I must finish a book once I pick it up. The book took so long to read that I was more excited to finish it than I would be if the plot had just a little bit of action."
2,Tedious to the extreme,"I thought after ""The Dante Club"" that the author would have been more experienced and better edited, but no. Even trapped on a cross-country flight, I could not keep interested in the plot or major characters. The author does a good job of imitating leisurely and feverish 19th prose, but this is the 21st century. I don't have the endless reading time of a wealthy person of the 19th century. For feverish writing, I'll return to any book by T. C. Boyle; for leisurely, any classic of 19th century literature."
1,Nevermore,"Being a Poe's fan, I was excited to find this book. I am an avid reader but I have not been able to finish it. Annoying characters, slow and tedious plot,repetitive. It takes more than 100 pages to get something going. I was close to drop the book before that but I kept on reading, with the hope that something good will come. Sadly, it was not worth. The main character seems too dumb to breathe while the rest have almost supernatural powers, being able to fool the whole world. Maybe Poe died of desperation after he realised what mistake he made hiring this guy as his attorney. That would certainly explain it. A huge disappointment."
1,Pearl Jam,"One of the factors that makes for good reading is that the reader must identify, in some way, with the protagonist. This doesn't mean he/she has to like that person - i n some books the protagonist is The Bad Guy - but the reader has to feel some sort of empathy with what that person is doing or trying to do.The major problem with ""The Poe Shadow"", one that was a minor problem with Pearl's first work, ""The Dante Club"", is that the protagonist, or ""hero"", is, to put it mildly, an annoying, uninteresting Jerk. When you add that to a plot that doesn't even start to unwind for the first 100 pages or so, you end up with a work that is best suited for a free gift to your local library.I have a private little mechanic I use for reading novels. If I have to say to myself ""You've gotta be kidding"" three times, the book gets tossed. With ""Poe"" , Number 3 rang out somewhere around page 100 . . .A major disappointment, and a shadow of the real Poe."
1,About pricing errors,My guess is that they tried to get rid of some old inventory by marking these down but sold way more than they expected and realized that they can't make up the costs. You can always take advantage of their hokey Gold Box deals that make you think you're special even though they're offered to everyone and their cousin.
3,A few Problems,"The idea behind this coffee maker is great. It is the only one that makes a full pot of coffee with a steamer attached. They used to sell the steamers separately and we loved those so thought this would be good. The coffee is great, the timer fine, the carafe that keeps it warm wonderful, but the steamer is tempermental and difficult to work. I would suggest a separate steamer. Else all if fine."
4,Tried and Tested for three months...so far so great!,"I would concur with the other fellow from Rochester- this machine is worth the price- the frothing mechanism is awesome and works consistently. The 4 rather than 5 stars is because of the fact that if you have lots of folks to froth for- you will need to put more water in the reservoir (to create the steam) this is something I figured out by trial...and now when it doesnt froth, I just check the res- and sure enough, it needs more H2O.Also, I would like the spot under which the froth comes out to have more clearance (i.e. so I can put a big bucket there and leave it to froth on its own. But as it is now, only a cup can fit there and you can spoon the froth into cups- making enough for about 2 (maybe) lattes.But makes excellent coffee that stays hot for a long time. Cannot pay this little for this type of machine with this capability. So- all in all- I am very happy with it!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,failure,"I used the machine the first day I got it and loved it but when I went to use it the second day neither the LED clock display nor the ""on"" light would work. Still waiting to hear about a return or replacement item."
5,"The best, period.","I purchased this coffee maker 6 years ago. It has been used once or twice a day since then. It works perfectly. The brew cycle is fast and the carafe keeps coffee hot for hours. I could not do without the removable water container which allows the machine to remain against the back of the counter. Every so often I use Dip-It coffee maker cleaner. This is available in many grocery stores and does a superior job compared to white vinegar and besides, who wants their coffee maker smelling like a hot salad? If this machine were to stop working I would not even consider looking at another coffee maker regardless of the price."
5,Slow Start,It is a little slow at start. But it does get much better as the series goes on. I also love the way the story unfolds with the people of the town.
5,Love This Show,This is a great show Jennifer Love Hewitt plays a great part in this show I am glad they are releasing this on dvd. I love to watch this show on friday nights and also love to watch Medium on monday nights starring Patricia Arquette these are great shows that takes us to the world of the unknown and there is a spirutualality of both shows that I think everyone will love and get hooked on too.You can watch Ghost Whisperer on CBS on Friday Nights at 8pm eastern time. and Medium on NBC on Monday Nights at 10pm. you will be hooked.
5,Ghost Whisperer,"The package was delivered in 5 days. Packaging was typicle Amazon box, undamaged. This was the complete first season."
3,Darn!,"I love this series and I was going to buy both seasons until I read that they'd changed the music. Sorry. I wanted the shows that I saw (and heard), not phony substitutes."
3,CLEAVAGE SHOWCASE,"The editorial comments say, ""the show is not shy about showing Jennifer Love Hewitt's bosom."" That's really the only reason this show is worth watching. I give it 1 star for the show and 5 for JLH's cleavage, thus 3 stars."
2,Ugh. Barbie helps dead people. Diabetics beware.,"I actually had to turn this one off because it was so BAD. Sacherine, with bad acting. It's more about how thin and pretty the actress is than the dead people. It'll appeal to people desperate for a JLH fix (afraid I can't be included there) and people so needing to watch dead-people-TV that they'll overlook the flaws."
1,Quality sucks!!!,"I bought this season to my wife, and she likes to see the episodes with subtitles because we live in Costa Rica. In Amazon's description said that this season came with english subtitles, and in fact it really came with no subtitles. Also, the episodes didn't came with chapter division, I can't select a specific chapter from an episode. I think that this two flaws are unacceptable for a DVD."
5,a favorite,"Jennifer Love Hewitt finally has a role that does her justice. Ghost Whisperer is an excellent series and well acted by all the actors. It just clicks. Melinda plays a medium who helps the dead finish their business with their loved ones. Ghost Whisperer is definitely much better than the show it replaced ""Joan of Arcadia"" and you finally get to see Hewitt's acting chops in this series. She can definitely act, she's not just eye candy. Check it out if you're looking for something different."
2,Twenty-seven dollars for 3 pieces of one book?,"This futuristic story is one of Jaid Black's best works, but I am irritated by the fact that in order to get the whole story I will have to spend $27 dollars (the book is in three separate parts). I bought the first two, but it has taken so long for the third part to come out that I have lost interest and I don't want to pay another nine dollars. If Ms Black is going to continue to write her books in this manner, I will no longer purchase them."
5,Do you want to know (and learn from) Jay?,"This book is fantastic, not only for the pictures but for all the things that you can learn just reading an interview to someone like Jay, he's a great guy.[...]"
1,Quit working after 1 year,"Although it was somewhat difficult to fill as the other reviewers have mentioned, that really didn't bother me. I had more of an issue with the bottle that the anti-bacterial liquid came in, which I found was nearly impossible to add to the water tank without getting it on my hands and you are supposed to avoid contact with skin. My sister has the same unit and poured the liquid into a pump bottle which worked much better.Unfortunately, I never got to try that because by the time she gave me the helpful hint, my unit had quit working. I got it for Christmas and it lasted the rest of that winter plus half of the next winter for a total of about 13 months, only 5 months of which it was actually in use.The unit still turns on but the fan will not run, making it worthless."
3,Need to know basis,"This is an important part of the Bisexual living. Bisex 101 you could say. How to plot your sexual preference and lifestyle in a scientific way. To further expand your knowledge there are newer books though, but can't hurt to have this one."
2,If you must...,"Don't get me wrong. Megadeth are my personal favorite metal band of all time. I enjoy every album, even Risk.BUT... buy this one ONLY if you MUST have a live version of ""The Conjuring."" I had to have it, since they played that one on that tour but did not include it on the live album. They also were playing ""Motopsycho"" and I would have liked to have seen that one on this album, too. Alas, 'twas not to be."
2,What the Heck?,"Stupid Me, I picked up this CD without reading the track listing before buying. I thought it was just made up of unreleased live tracks. I eventually found out while reading the track listing in my car that half of it is unreleased live tracks, while the rest is old material previously released on The World Needs A Hero album. So Why Bother? Why didn't they release the rare and hard to find tracks like DUKE NUKEM, CROWN OF WORMS, ONE THING, COMING HOME, NEW WORLD ORDER, SYMPHONY OF DESTRUCTION (THE GRISTLE MIX), and TRUST (ECW INSTRUMENTAL REMIX) along with the live tracks. Those tracks are harder than heck to come by, so they should've released them instead! AGHHHHHH Only buy if your a completist. Hopefully Megadeth will release another album sometime in the future with all of their rare tracks much in the vein of Hidden Treasures. We can only hope."
2,Use the man indeed.,"Well, if you haven't figured it out by now, this isn't exactly a ""new"" Megadeth album. What it's supposed to be is unreleased tracks (throwaways?) from ""Rude Awakening"" and some tracks from ""The World Needs a Hero"".The best of the live tracks is easily ""Time/Use the Man"", whose inclusion almost justifies buying this. Yes, I am a big Megadeth fan, have been for years. But, I bought this CD not knowing what songs were on it ... and was more than a little disapointed when I found out that half of the album are tracks from ""The World Needs a Hero"" which I had purchased days before.That said, this is for die-hard fans only, and that's just for the unreleased tracks from ""Rude Awakening"". Save your money and buy ""The World Needs a Hero"", it's much better than this."
3,Megadeth - 'Still Alive... And Well?' (Sanctuary Records),"Since I've seen Megadeth perform live something like at least ten times over the years,I've pretty much gotten burned out on them.I'll still take out a CD of theirs time and again for a spin in my CD player.I thought that 'Still Alive...' is pretty much aimed toward the die-hard fans.It's got half live tracks,including ""My Darkest Hour"",""Sweating Bullets"",""Symphony Of Destruction"",the always nice to hear ""Holy Wars""+ two more.Then you get six previously unreleased cuts.If you're a real big Megadeth fan,you'll obviously get more out of this CD than I did.Overall,it's decent."
2,Where's your head Dave? (or Sanctuary...),"With the ghost of the once mighty Megadeth hanging above the heavy metal world, Sanctuary Records has decided to release this compilation featuring two whole unreleased live tracks, a few other live songs from Megadeth's first domestic live album ""Rude Awakening"" which was released earlier this year, and six tracks from Megadeth's ""World Needs a Hero"" which was released last year. The two unreleased live tracks (""Time"" and ""The Conjuring"") are worth a listen or two, and if this was priced quite a bit lower I could maybe warrant a purchase, but if you already own ""World Needs a Hero"" and ""Rude Awakening"" than there is absolutely no point in wasting money on this. I just hope that Megadeth will return someday so Sanctuary Records doesn't have to keep putting these types of compilations out just to fulfil a record contract."
1,Why even bother?,"Not worth the plastic it was pressed on. Come on Dave, I know you like to make a quick buck, but at least be realistic. The two whopping live tracks that are new you can probably find elsewhere. If anything, some live tracks of other stuff they have played in the past would've been good. 99 ways to die is an example, I've only ever heard once live. My recommendation is that if you are going to buy something, the Rude Awakening DVD is probably the route to go, since it has a mix of everything they've ever played."
3,Horror Film,I received this movie on time as promised. It wasn't exactly what I was looking for but was fun to watch. Guess I was looking forsome scary movies without the sex and blood. Hard to find these days.
5,Great Special Effects,"The originality of the special effects make this episode worth the price of the DVD. Director Bill Malone uses a camera running at quarter speed to create the illusion of the cellar creature moving jerkily like a fly. This is a great innovation which does not depend on a lot of fancy (and expensive) digital effects. Also, the face-squashing scene near the end of the film (which only lasts a few seconds and uses only three or four frames of digital effects) is brilliant in it's simplicity and shock value. Whereas the beheading scene of a female victim in another epsode proved to be nauseous in it's realism, Bill's digital morph from face to chicken breast implanted with an eye doesn't cause the viewer to toss his/her cookies... and is a lot more fun because it happens so quickly and also because it's... just so weird! Great scene, Bill!"
4,Almost 5 stars...,"I find this video fun and motivating and use it about three times a week. I did wonder why they didn't edit out some parts -- like the counts what were off and Leslie leaving before cool-down and coming back in, but overall, I enjoy this video."
5,3 mile slim & sleek walk,I like this walk a lot. It isn't one that really brings on the sweat for me but I like the different moves.
2,Good workout for a beginner or older person.,"This is a good beginner workout or a good one for an older person to keep moving with. It's not a very good one for someone who has been working out for a while. My heart rate never got out of the low zone and I never broke a sweat. I was not impressed with the pilates portion at all. I think I will donate this dvd to my mom who is 58, but I actually think she is probably more advanced than this."
5,Great workout!,"This is a great workout for anyone. The weather is cold now, so it is perfect to do indoors."
5,Cut to the chase of Critical Chain by Dr. Goldratt,"I found this book a great supplement and synopsis of Dr. Goldratt's book Critical Chain. It isn't that Goldratt's book is a tough read, in fact it is entertaining and straighforward. But Mark Woepple's book is a great addition to the novel. He adds detailed analyses, concise examples, and opens up another layer to the novel that can make for a richer experience. It is not like a cheat sheet to the book, although could be for beginners, but it also adds more depth and another perspective that I found valuable as a leaders, an instructor, and a coach for TOC/CCPM in the professional world. Thank you Mark for this read."
4,"Mediocre product, but my 4yo was amused","not a top of the line product, but it was cheap so that's to be expected. it's small enough to be comfortably used by a 4yo, and it's suffered substantial abuse, and still works."
5,I agree with the Midwest Book Review,The reviewer was right that said that if you are a new parent out there exploring your options then Every Parent's Guide to Attachment Parenting is a book you have to pick up. Great information.
5,Delicious!,"This was a great book which I enjoyed very much. I really liked the way Audrey and Charles have their ups and downs, the same games lovers play today! Theirs was an arranged marriage, but they hit all the bumps in the road to true love that anyone else would. All the same worrying, crying, misunderstandings and jumping to conclusions, that myself and many others can relate to! Thank goodness things turned out as well for me as for her! :-) Bon apetit!"
4,Maybe too fancy?,"There are many good recipes in this book, but I would like to see more ""normal"" or comfort food recipes modified to work with the South Beach diet."
3,"Good, Healthy Recipes","This recipe book has some good recipes. I especially like the sausage and cheese breakfast cups. Some of the other recipes are rather complicated, with ingredients that may be hard to find. I have had better luck with ""South Beach"", than anything else."
1,Who designed this thing?,Like others have said:1. The spout cover sticks and spills water everywhere when it does.2. If you fill the entire reservoir it will spill out the back of the pitcher near the handle.3. The 'indicator' is just a timer. Don't be fooled.4. The top barely fits on the pitcher. Don't even THINK about pouring a glass of water before its finished filtering the water in the top.All in all this pitcher was a huge disappointment. I owned the previous model for years and was happy with it. Water tastes fine but that's the easy part (its a carbon filter...not hard to design and make).Prepare your kitchen for wetness...
2,design flaws: the top won't stay on anymore!,"Brita's got great filters, and the pitchers *used* to be great -- the tops stayed on like magic. Now, though, they come off constantly -- if there's *any* water in the top section, it'll be all over your counter if you dare to try to pour it. We're switching brands because of this."
2,Great if you want to tone your arms,"I've had the pitcher for two years, and the water is great. With all the money I'm saving, wished I'd make the switch from bottled water sooner. However I can't recommend the Deluxe Water Pitcher, because it's been two years of frustration. Two years of having to take the pitcher over to the sink every time I pour a glass of water because the lid does not close. The moment you tilt to pour the lid comes loose and the water spills. I thought I had a defective pitcher, but when I saw that other reviewers had the same problem, I wrote a letter to Brita. Their ""response"" was to send me a new lid (no response to my question about the lid being a design flaw). The replacement lid has the same problem. I not going to pass my frustration on anyone by giving away this 'mistake', I'll add it to the recycle bin and and find another brand."
4,Great gift idea!,I purchased this pitcher as a Christmas gift for my daughter who lives in the country and doesn't like her well water. She loves this pitcher! Says it makes her water taste like bottled water. :)
1,"Bigger, but tastes like Charcoal","In Columbia SC we have been voted to have the best city water in the nation. I first purchased the small Brita to filter out the Chlorine but dropped it so I replaced with this larger one. At first I was thrilled with the Brita but noticed in the last few months the water tastes like charcoal even after I replaced the filter and ran several pitchers through it. My husband said the same thing with the pitcher he bought for his work in Charleston, 2 hrs away so different city water, same bad taste after going through the Brita pitcher.I have a bladder condition so the water I consume is very important. I now only drink Deer Park water because it has a Ph of 8 and the bottles are made of less plastic than regular water bottles.If you still want to try this product, buy the small one first to see if you like the taste or not."
4,great start,"I used this book several years ago to get started, it give good pointers about helping kids have fun, you can get drill from lots of places but it helps you think about things properly for kids to have fun"
3,Brita On Tap Replacement Filters,We have ordered the Brita on tap replacement Filters twice and each time one of the filters has already indicated that it is ready to change before it is even used. We love the filter but shouldn't both filter replaements be usable? Quality control is not the best.
5,Brita is Better,Brita has made an excellent product.It is easy to install.Runs a strong stream of clean water.Does not need to be replaced often.
3,good but,"The Brita tap filter is a very good product in the sense that the water loses the chlorine taste and actually gain a smooth feeling, just like fresh mountain water. On the other hand, these filters have a very short lifespan. I changed the system for Pur. So far it looks like it will last longer."
1,Didn't work,"While we like Brita, one of the two we ordered didn't work. It showed an amber light no matter what we did and it's not easy to return a filter filled with water."
3,As advertised.,"i bought these for a friend as a gift. I am not so sure this is a very good system, the filters really expensive and they don't last very long. Your tap water must be toxic to use these. But this won't help the people in up state New York with methane contaminated wells from fracking."
1,insulting to all victims of the war,"This book is an insult to the victims of all sides in this war. There is a clear line of aggressor and victims here, which was Milosevic trying to create a greater Serbia by attacking neighboring republics. This is evident in the facts that no war was faught on Serbian territory and that Nato ended up bombing Belgrade, in Serbia, and finally that Milosevic was handed to the Hague war crimes tribunal by fellow serbs. This war was a tragedy for all involded, and hundreds of thousands of victims, misplaces, refugees, and raped women shouldn't be insulted by the writings of an insensitive blow hard who is simply trying to create a name for himself by stirring up controversy."
3,Works ok,"Works only ok for herbs, but I have been using it to mill nuts over foods and it seems to work better for this application. Looks pretty cool so it was worth it from that perspective."
5,So easy and convenient!,Contrary to the previous reviewer I love this product. It works perfectly as long as you dry the herbs before grinding them. It is so much easier and safer (a child could do it) than having to chop them on a cutting board. I recommend it highly.
1,Totally worthless... save your money.,"The bottle has no markings on it that say the strength of the solution. I really cannot tell if it has any in there. They probably don't want a lawsuit since potassium iodide is a very strong chemical, but this may be so weak, the solution so slight as to be ineffective.If you plan to dose more than one person, I would seek a solution elsewhere."
1,First time I got nothing from Amazon order,This is my first time I did not receive my order from Amazon. I report it to the customer support of the storee me just gave me tracking number of my complain case by emails. Please response me ASAP!
1,DO NOT BUY,"I purchased this and received it quickly, however, when I opened the box it has leaked all over the place. It was in a glass bottle but had a plastic lid and it had leaked through the plastic tear off/shrink wrap seal on the exterior. Very sketchy. In addition, there is no dosage info on the bottle. When I contacted the email address on the packing slip (there's no phone number) I never rec'd a response. It's a total scam and I just wasted $20.00. Entirely dissatisfied and would suggest Amazon stop doing business with this company."
5,Got for my wife.,"She likes watches and I thought this would help her keep them organized. She loved it. In fact wants another. Was out of stock, but now back. She will order."
1,Poorly assembled,"This book is virtually worthless to those of us who are iunterested in owning a quality collection of the silver age comics we remember from '66-71. The writing is printed in a fake ""comic book"" lettering style that is impossible to read against the jumbled mess of cluttered color underneath. Extremely amateurish in layout and design, it has nothing to offer the art lover. The choices in artwork are not the classic images one would hope for, and have nothing to do with the most important developments in the medium. I would not have bought this book if not for the rave reviews here, and now I regret it. Bad on all accounts, I will porobably never open the book again. An insult to the great creators that contributed so much to my youth, this book is virtually a total rip-off."
3,Softcover buyer beware,"Take heed. The softcover omits 16 or so pages from the hardcover, so you don't get the mini-features on Wallace Wood, Curt Swan, Nick Cardy, Murphy Anderson, and John Buscema which I really wanted to see. I think it's a really cheap move on Collectors Press' part. Why couldn't they have included those 16 extra pages? If they are trying to entice people to buy the hardcover, why bother making a softcover edition at all? Otherwise, a beautiful book."
5,Looking for Potato Ricer,My husband and I have been looking for a replacement for our potato ricer. This ricer was exactly what we were looking for as a replacement. The best part of it is the extra blades.
5,Fantastic- It really works,"My 18 month old son has suffered with eczema since birth and nothing that the doctor or health visitor gave him would work. He had got to the stage that he could not sleep at night for scratching and we hated seeing him in so much distress, when i saw Freederm on there website I thought it was worth giving it a go since nothing else had worked and i can honestly say that within 3 days of using the cream he had almost stopped sratching and he was sleeping through the night it is heaven in a tub."
2,FreeDerm HC,"This product did not work for us--I believe just over the counter Hydrocortisone would have worked as well as this. I will admit my son's eczema was pretty progressed by the time we got FreeDerm, and we did not see an improvement in a month's time. Some of the spots that were just beginning to develop might have improved, but we ended up having to get a prescription afterall, which healed the eczema in a week. And Eucerin cream (Equate brand)smothered on after a bath has done wonders preventing any new eczema (recommended by our physician)."
1,Betetr save your money & buy cheap eczema creams over the counter,"I got very small spot on my face,and I tried very cheap eczema cream Cortaid with 1.0% of hydrocortisone. It didnt help much, though it became significantly small, less red & no itch at all, Id say ""almost gone"",so after I decided to buy this one , more expensive brand Freederm HC with same amount of hydrocorisone 1.0% . It didnt make ANY CHANGES..Im using it every day, evry time I wash my face, since 3 months, that small spot is still thereDo not waste your money, it works exactly as any another cheap brand. In my case it didnt work better than Cortaid that I hadI DO NOT RECOMMEND IT"
2,Not the same formula,"Have purchased Freederm HC from the manufacturer many times over the last several years, and it used to be a great product. However, they have changed the cream and it's not the same, nor does it do the job for our family any longer."
1,Did nothing for me,"As soon as I got the Freederm moisturizer, I was immediately suspicious because it looked exactly like Cerave which I purchased over the counter in a container that was twice the size, yet half the price of Freederm. Cerave had little palliative effects for me and Freederm had absolutely zero effect on my eczema versus the Cerave, and did virtually nothing to moisturize my skin. 20 minutes after application, my skin was just as dry and irritated as before the application.I have since switched to moisturizers and balms from Earthworm Herbals. That product has not cured my eczema by any means, but it has stabilized it. It does maintain it's moisturizing effects for a few hours after application. Best of all, it reduces the itchiness to a great degree so I don't have to apply steroid creamanywhere near as much as before. I'd much rather have natural products on my skin than a steroid cream.Freederm cream was an absolute waste of money. Avoid this product."
4,Dancing With Temptation,"In this second novel by self published author, Barbara Joe Williams, she once again takes on the subject of infidelity within marriage- only this time the culprit is the wife. Nowadays when such occurrences are becoming more and more prevalent, Ms. Williams gives us a candid glimpse into the heart of a marriage on the brink of disaster. Struggling with temptation is something everyone faces-husbands and wives alike- and to see the other side of the coin was eye opening, a reflection of truth many women don't want to admit exists. Tina and Martin Carlisle are friends of Michael and Alise Wayne's (from FORGIVE US THIS DAY) who are shocked to find themselves embroiled in a similar situation. Ms. Williams weaves a strong inspirational message within this roller coaster ride of a story.Reviewed by Elissa KyleThe Romance Readers Connection"
5,Makes practice fun,This book has lots of fun drills that are relevant to the skills you are trying to teach. I coach 6-8 year old girls and they all have lots of fun. I think this would be good for boys and even older kids. I have read several other books by this author and they are all easy to use and read.
4,Excellent Drills,"This another good soccer book with great games. It's a great supplement to Coching Youth Soccer: A Baffled Parent's Guide, however if you are planning on only purchasing one go with Coaching Youth Soccer."
2,Don't waste your money,"Although the theory works, in practice, the machine is not worth the money. The Espresso maker only works with very coarse ground coffee, put anything in that is a little finer and the system comes to a grinding halt. The drip side works fine although you could get the same functionality for a fraction of the cost."
5,Great comfort in a stylish heel,"These are by far the most comfortable shoe I own other than slippers. I love heels and will sacrifice pain at times, but don't need to with these. They have a comfortable padding and nice arch for my flat feet. I don't feel like all my weight is bearing down on the ball of my feet when I wear these. Hardly know its a heel. The woman who sold them to me claimed part of the comfort is the platform that you can see if you look at the seam near the bottom. I've gotten tons of compliments. I go between an 8.5 an 9 and in these a 9 was great. I've never owned Clarks before (I thought they looked dumpy) but am ready to order another pair from their Artisian line."
5,Did more than clear my sinuses,This is the best product I have used. When running down my throat it also cured my tonsil stones with its antiseptic effect. I highly recommend it.
4,Fun cooking,This cookbook has many selection of dishes to choose from. I have worked with several of these dishes. These recipes are very easy to make and are very tasty. Give this cookbook a try. My family could not get enough.
4,Great Diagrams for hyrdos,I found this book to be very good on explaining how exactly a lowrider works as well as how to set up a hyrdulic system on a car. This book has the best diagrams of complete systems i have ever seen. It also has some good basic information on other topics as well. I have to say though this is the best book you can buy if your going to start to build a lowrider this is the place to start.
1,Pretty darn awful!,"Richard Nanes' music never seems to add up to much, or to take the listener anywhere particularly rewarding. Too often, Nanes seems to delight in the intentially ill-turned phrase. Why? Is it to deliberately engender audience dissatisfaction? These two symphonies are all too reminiscent of his other music: that is to say, alternatively boring and unpleasant, and ultimately wholly forgettable. The overblown title references (e.g., ""The Holocaust Symphony"") designed to attract attention and interest, don't fool us for long. Spend your hard-earned cash elsewhere on much better American contemporary composers, such as Richard Danielpour."
4,Living out loud,"I listened to this item on audio cd and it was great.There is nothing better than hearing the story of his life as it is told by the author himself. Bernie tells it like it is and the reader can't help but get caught up in the experiences as the story unfolds into a tell of ""The world accourding to Bernie Mac"". As you listen to this audio you will feel as if you are at the dining table talking story with your good friend. Bernie talks about his life as a child, his marriage, sex, money, his friends, and it extends all the way up into his career in comedy. There is much humor and you will be laughing from beginning to end of this audio."
2,OK,Not really that great of a read. To me it was too dis-jointed - if that is a term. Just barely OK and that is because I like westerns and history.
2,The Pistolers,"Mistakenly thought this was a factual ""tale"" Expected more fact, not so much fiction. Should have paid more attention to description."
2,Unsatisfying read,"Although I don't have to have all the pieces of a story, neatly tied up at a book's conclusion, On Agate Hill left too much to be desired. I'm not sure what the initial set up--a family fractured by ""cheerful"" betrayal-- had to do with the rest of the story. To be honest, I had such a hard time getting into this book, that if I hadn't been trapped on an air plane, I would have put it down and never picked it up again. After 100 pages, I did find a sustainable interest in the main characters, but overall I was disappointed in the historical context and the discordant attempts at humor."
3,On Agate Hill,"The book is what we expected. The service level and execution of the ordering and shipment process was ""vintage"" Amazon and therefore quite acceptable."
5,Great Book,"I loved this book, once I was able to establish characters and get over the ""hump."" It had me hooked. Best book I have read in a long time."
2,Cuisipro--not!,"I WOULD give this 5 stars, because it really was great straining fine particles, but it didn't last. See pictures on product page--one side became open. Less than 3 mos. of use...return window expired on Aug 28, 2011. That's why I give 2 stars only.Cuisipro 7"" Cone Shaped Strainer"
1,creative title - below par book,"Valerie Senetha Miles has taken a creative title and turned it into a below par book. Although she provides incite into some of the extreem hardships to expect as an Army wife, her griping becomes excessive. She complains about struggles that nearly all people face regardless of their spouse's profession, such as doing dishes, avoiding weight gain, fighting traffic, and shopping within one's means. If Miles was a stronger, less materialistic individual and had written the book with a more positive outlook on life I think I would have enjoyed it."
5,Great Book,A must for every college parent. Seaman does an excellent job of informing students and parent what to expect at today's institutions. Parents - read this book!
3,7-year-old's perspective,"My son had the following to say:This toy has a really cool light-up head. The DNA slime bubbles appear to ooze when the button on his back is pressed. [My son points out that the figure tips over easily -- the center of balance is high because of the large hands -- but I think he poses just fine. This figure has knees, but they do not bend. Each arm flexes and rotates at the shoulder and elbow]."
5,It gets better every time I watch,"Although this is arguably the spawn of the Joe Schmo Show, it might be one of the funniest movies ever made. It's definitely an acquired taste, but every time I see Perry's action figure I laugh for 5 minutes. Or the stunt double. Or the limo driver.For reference, I'm a fan of comedies like Safe Men, The Royal Tenenbaums, Outside Providence, Beerfest, Rushmore.HIGHLY recommended!"
2,Windy City Heat,"Was not worth the money spent. I would have been happy with the product for around 10-15 dollars but Amazon's add on fees blew it way out of proportion.I believe I ended up spending around 25-30 dollars for this cheaply, sort of pothetic documentry-type flick.This decision will make me think twice when buying from Amazon compared to ebay or other online choices."
4,"If it's real, it's amazing!","I read that Windy City Heat is %100 real. Meaning that the lead actor Actually Thinks that he's doing a real movie. The movies says so and it claims to be true online. With that, then it is insanely hilarious, however it's almost hard to believe he would be that dumb."
4,Connecticut`s side streets and back roads,A nice look at the side streets and back roads of Connecticut. This book has many human interest stories and is fine bedtime reading.
1,major rip-off,"This book's premise is fine, and the exercises are reasonable. It would have made a perfectly good magazine article. But instead, he has padded the thing out beyond belief. The first 60 pages are trivial rehashes of information anyone who's ever read anything about fitness could repeat back, printed in big type with lots of title pages, but that's simply harmless. What's inexcusable is the repeating word for word, picture for picture, all the ""belly day"" exercises for each of three levels: all four pages of each Monday's routines are repeated for Wednesday, and again for Friday!Conclusion: $4 worth of information, packaged in a slick and annoying self-promoting $12.95 package."
5,great tarp for camping,I purchased this tarp to use under my tent. It's perfect. Thick enough to protect the tent floor from sticks and rocks and my kids!!
3,lids do not seal at all,"Very pretty. However, the lids do not seal at all, making them unsuitable for food storage in my home. I kept them for a few days, wondering if there was some way to retrofit the lids and make them seal. I decided kitchen canister should seal without a whole lot of work on the consumer's part."
1,Not what I thought it would be,"I was not happy with the quality of this product. Although the color is beautiful, the canisters are very thin, and do not come with the air tight seals. I returned them."
5,Works as advertised,"Learning to make the soil blocks takes a bit of time, but once you've got the moisture level right (consistency of peanut butter), it's easy. ALL my lettuce seeds sprouted right away!"
3,The End of an Era,"By the time that this material was recorded, Mabel had passed her peak, but it still contains many moments of magic."
4,Study but mismarked,"These are very sturdy measuring spoons that stand on their own, thanks to their design. However, the set comes with two teaspoons, on is clearly a teaspoon and the other is a mismarked tablespoon... Fail stamping die operator.Otherwise, exactly what we wanted, just a bad run. Returning to Amazon, confident they'll send a properly marked set."
4,Great...but where is the 1/2 Tbs,These work well. But I was disappointed there was no 1/2 Tbs. I had to hang on to the one from my old plastic set :/
4,Cuisipro Stainless Steel Measuring Spoon Set,The spoons are solid and heavy. The engraved quantities are clear and easy to read. The polishing is sub-par. All the edges are uneven and lumpy. A few of the spoons have ugly black pitting.
2,14k yellow gold Amethyst dangle earings,"I am disappointed with these earings. They looked more solid on the photo, but they are flimsy. Also the amethyst stones look very pale and also not like the photo. They look much cheaper than they were (in cost), so that is the main reason for my disappointment.I bought them as a gift for my daughter and thought I would be pleased to give them, but I am not!"
3,Good coffee while it works,"We bought this coffee maker in 2001. A couple of months after our purchase, we had to return it for a new machine because coffee leaked everywhere. As someone else stated in another review, customer service was great and took care of our replacement without question and timely. About a year later the programmable brewing feature stopped working. Several months ago, the part at the bottom of the basket that allows you to remove the caraffe and pour a cup before brewing is complete without dripping broke off. Now the machine only works intermittently, it has to be unplugged and plugged in again a few times before it decides to work. So, I'm on Amazon shopping for a new coffee maker since our days with the Capresso are numbered. I won't purchase the same machine again. I expect more life and quality from a $99 machine."
2,Not complete,"This is not complete by any means. There are many times I have had to go to the internet to find information that is not in this book, including basic features such as functions that are missing and details regarding data types. I could understand if it was missing advanced concepts, but it is missing introductory information."
1,Don't Even Bother.,"Having read ""Why the Left Hates America,"" I must say that I'm much worse off for it. This is hysterical nonsense masquerading as high-minded academic opinion. The book, apart from its intellectual sloppiness, is filled with sweeping generalizations and an affront to those on the academic Right who continually confront those on the ""Left"" in a constructive meaningful way. Seek out the true heroes and academics on the Right. Don't waste your money or your time on this book. I would have given it zero stars had I the option to do so."
1,Typical crybaby book,The authors of the right love to recycle the same old thing because they know how much hatred sells to their fellow rightwingers. The people who brag about how moral they are and how they are protecting the virtues of this morality espouse such hatred. Morality and hatred. That's quite a mix. Suppertime conversation must be something to behold. There's nothing like ignorance by the right to make me proud to understand that this country is made up of people with varying opinions. America is great because of this. Maybe the right should leave the country if they hate fellow Americans so much. You could practice intolerance elsewhere and leave the United States alone.
5,Why I agree with Mr. Flynn,I found the book to be quite honest and to the point. Maybe we should all learn from Mr. Flynn's words.
2,Disappointing,Very confusing information. No order on the subject. I believe the author is probably a poultry fancier but not a game fowl authority. Just a second star for some good pictures.
3,I Liked It!,"Considering when it was shot, it turned out well. What a great band! I really enjoyed seeing them from back in the day. I hadn't even heard of the band till 1986. That's my 2 cents."
1,"If you like music, then skip this DVD","1. ok, like everyone who is interested in the DVD, likes dixie dregs (an obvious statement).2. thus, if you're interested in the dixie dregs and thus their music, this is not the DVD to get because the sound is subpar (ok, you're kind of expecting that because it was recorded in 1978) but beyond that, the overall mixing is completely terrible. at times, you can hear steve morse and especially when he's soloing, you can barely hear the guitar. yes, i did go into the menu system and try the two different audio settings--> no difference.3. thus, yes, the dixie dregs put out some incredible music in their time. but this DVD doesn't do them justice and in fact is a complete waste of time / money due to poor sound quality."
3,Same but still a must !,"I follow along with all other reviews about sound quality and ""Allen Sloan Show"", but I am a Dregs fan thru and thru ! I would rather see this than not ! I am a huge Meat Puppets fan and their only DVD offering sucks for production and sound quality, but I would not be without it and take it for what it is. A chance to watch a band in it's hey day at any quality is better than not ! If in fact you bought this to see Steve, do yourself a favor and buy the Steve Morse Band DVD. He is front and center and you can get all the notes you need. I do hope someday Steve throws another show out that has all assets of true quality and mixing. Hell, I just want more Steve ! Being selfish !"
4,Best electric I've tried,"I got this because I was tired of shelling out massive $$ for the Mach3 I had been using. This is almost as good as a blade, and a lot cheaper over the long run. I've had a Norelco and a Braun, and the shave wasn't even remotely as close as a blade. This isn't quite there, but good enough so I get through the day without looking like I have 2nd day shadow. Cleaning is very simple -- running the blade under water, or using soap, seems to work better than the cartridge system, which is good if you want to avoid that expense. Only downside is I had a fair amount of razor burn when I first started using it for wet shaves -- but now (after about 2 months) I am using it in the shower pretty much every day. On the whole a good purchase."
3,"Fast and close, but...","The great motor and thin foil make this a fast, close shave, but the design makes cutting ALL the neck hairs very difficult for me. Seems like a little thing, but the hair it leaves is irritated by a collar, especially a buttoned one with a tie."
3,Doesn't live up to it's hype!,"Was expecting much more from Panasonic. Doesn't do that great of a job, have to keep going over and over and will still miss a few."
3,Nice but very loud,"I have used a Norelco rotary shaver for the past 3 years. I like it but I get ingrown hairs a lot. I bought the Panasonic 8077 to see how it did w/ ingrown hairs. My first impression is that it is extremely loud when compared to my Norelco. So much so, that I am considering returning it just based on the noise. It shaves nicely..and faster than the Norelco, but I can't yet tell if there is any difference between closeness."
2,If you need to shave every day this isn't for you,"I wanted this to work. I hate shaving. Razor burn, cuts, and all that. I wanted a simple easy shave in the morning. The reviews looked good so I gave it a shot for a couple weeks.The razor itself did a decent job on the cheeks. As far as the neck when, a blind barber could do a better shave. It either gave me unbelievable razor burn or completely missed huge patches of untouched hair. For whatever reason if you had a stray hair left on the neck it couldn't seem to get it no matter how many passes I'd try. Any blade system from disposable to mach whatever is superior. This very well might be the best electric razor out there but it's not for me."
5,better than expected,"my main priority in shaving is to have a very smooth and close shave. this shaver has exceeded my expectations in how close of a shave i get. i can now shave every 2 days w/o any irritation to get a close shave and not walk around with stubble. i was not able to shace this often with a razor, since the facial hair would not be long enought to cut smoothly. i am very happy."
3,Not bad,"This is an OK electric shaver. It is not so good on the neck area, especially if you have ingrows, but does a great job on my face."
4,Panosonic Shaver ES8077,Highly recommended. This is my first electric shaver. I have been using it for several weeks and am very pleased with it. Its cuts well but of course not as close as a razor. It is much gentler on the face than a razor. I clean it by removing the foil head and running water over it. I have not used the vortex Hydra clean system yet. I have not felt the need. I have shaved both dry and wet. Good results both ways. The head pivots side to side smoothly and allows the shaver to follow your face contours better.
2,Not impressed,"After using this razor for a few months I am not impressed. I don't have real heavy growth, but this razor has a very tough time removing whiskers, even after repeatedly going over the same area. My old $30 Remington does a much better job. Also having to purchase the cleaning unit/solution on a recommended monthly basis, added on to it's rather high initial cost I cannot recommend it. A lot of technology but not much on results."
2,Good razor if you have 20 min's to shave,"I was very excited to receive this product, based on the reviews. But, I was extremely disappointed in its performance.Here is what I experienced with this razor:x Did not cut evenlyx Did not cut all my facial hair on first or, sometimes, second passx As a result, often took longer than using a hand-held (regular) razor bladex Messy storage device that's not easy to cleanx Expensive cleaning cartridgesPros:' Held a charge for a long time' Did like trimmer device' Looks niceI ended up going back to my hand-held razor and may get another Philips/Norelco, as I've personally had better experiences with those."
2,Stopped working after a year,"After using a Norelco for more than 5 years I decided to try a wet shaver. The Panasonic seemed like a good option so I bought one. The shaver worked like a charm, but after a year of usage I noticed it started to behave strangely. It would turn itself on and wouldn't turn off by using the on/off button. At the same the shaver alternated between normal and high speed vibration which made impossible to use.As the unit was out of warranty I decided to find out what the problem was, so I disassemble it and found water inside. The seal had failed and water got into the circuit board.Panasonic customer service would repair the unit for a ""fee"", but I'm buying a Norelco. They offer 2 year warranty and are extremely reliable."
2,Fast but slow,"I have been using this shaver for about 4 months. The motor is very fast and although not ""quiet"", surprisingly it is not too loud. However, and this may sound odd, but despite the fast motor, it shaves slowly. It feels like the holes in the foil are too small or something, and I have to go over and over the same areas. The good thing is, when I'm done, the shave feels close and comfortable. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend that you purchase this shaver."
4,"Another excellent ""linear"" shaver","I bought this to replace my three year old Panasonic ES8023. I found that my old ES8023 shaves as well as this one with the original three year old foil and blades. I even feel that the old shaver is more powerful. But I like the feature of pivoting shaving head and self-cleaning system in the new shaver.I tried Norelco before. I was very disappointed with the performance. Panasonic shavers shave very closely, and you can use it wet. The only problem I can think of is that it is a ""directional"" shaver. You have to glide the shaver against the growth of the hair.I strongly recommend Panasonic linear shaver. If money is an issue, get a cheapest linear shaver you can find."
3,Sensitive skin?? - Tolerable when using wet,"I have never had much success with electric razors. They irritate my skin, don't produce a close shave, and leave stray hairs. After reading the good reviews and getting a great deal on this one for eighty dollars I decided to give it a thirty day trialThe results:- It still leaves stray hairs that I have to touch up with a razor periodically, but leaves less that other models I have tried.- Using it in the shower/wet reduces that abrasion to the skin and makes it tolerable to use.I decided to keep this one because, although still subpar compared to a razor, I can use it everyday. It is very uncomfortable for me to use a razor everyday. If it weren't for the ability to use wet I would be sending this one back just like the others I have tried."
2,"An underwhelming introductory book, only covering basics","I found the book to be to a bit predictable and more than a little underwhelming. The author focused almost exclusively on the basic movies (fists & kicks, plus a few throws), the various stances and counters inherent to his style, and discussion about weight training, katas and kumite ... but he neglected to focus to any meaningful degree on the mental and philosophical aspects of his art. Sadly, a lot of people take relatively little interest in such things, but they meant (and still mean) a lot to me, and unfortunately the author glosses over such things.There are plenty of other books out there that take a much more ambitious approach, with the material, and as a result are much more satisfying to read and ponder. Seek them out."
3,Average information,"Did not meet my expectations. I was hoping some technical and artistic explanations in judging the musical piece but all I perceived was a verbal description of the music that you could explain to someone how the symphony was performed. Violins followed by clavier than picolos etc,etc. So at the end I did not know any more than listening the actual piece and confirming the authors arguments that indeed clavier follows violins. Why is it so good, I still do not know."
3,"Interesting, but might be better as a Documentary Movie","I'm about 2/3 done with this book. I previously read Black Hawk Down, and picked up this book next. While Black Hawk Down makes you feel like you are in the middle of the action, this book reads more like a documentary. You never quite feel for the heroes the author writes about; you never quite understand who they are, what their personalities are like, are what these people have gone through. Instead, its almost as if you are watching a black-and-white movie and are set far back away from the action. There's a lot of facts, and a lot of names. Names of people that not too many people (at least today) know about. The main point of the book seems to be that Special Operations has really grown up in America, and that frankly it was really disorganized before."
3,"Informative, historically accurate, lacks action","I enjoy military books immensely, and this book seemed right up my alley. I like those books that you can not put down, where you feel like you are right there in the middle of the action. This book, however, is written in a historical manner which presents lots of facts, names and who did this, who went where info. There is very little first-person action where conflicts are described and you feel part of the battle. Great book, well written, just not what I was looking for."
5,Excellent - THE book on the creation of USAF Special Tactics,"An excellent all around book. An up close look at the creation of the little known AF Special Tactics community. It is in-depth enough for those who know about these warriors, but not overwhelming for a more casual reader. The writing is tight and flows at a fairly good pace. Colonel Carney does a good job of highlighting the challenges and successes. While he is frank about failures and positive about successes and the future, you never get a sense he is trying to talk up his own accomplishments. I enjoyed the even tone of the book and the historical look at past world events from a very unique point of view. The book also has excellent Notes, Glossary and References sections that make for a useful resource for further reading."
5,Franklin Ready to go Hoops,"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas! His exact words were, ""Awesome - I love it!"""
5,One of my all-time faves!!!,Love this DVD!!! Carlos Mencia is an equal opportunity offender!!!! He's hilarious because HE IS HONEST!!! He doesn't spend his life PRETENDING to think and feel in ways that conform to the expectations of others.
1,Carlos is horrible- nuff said,"Probably one of the worst comedian's of all time that gets attention. His material comes from senarios about standing up to people that he doesnt agree with- how hard is that? Thats like me saying i hate abortion and then talking about women who get abortions. Untalented prick who tries to play it off like he's smart but he's not. He constantly blames the crowd for not catching his so called joke's. I didnt like him to begin with but i gave him a chance on this dvd. I only laffed once and I shut it off 45min. in. It just wasnt entertaining. Definetly a dvd for the weak minded stupid poeple of America. Carlos mencia to the rescue with his unimpressive, lack of creativity, idiodic views on the world. one word. Horrible-"
1,Completely and utterly awful in every way,"Congratulations Carlos, you have somehow managed to soil a title last used for an NSYNC album. That is impressive. This dvd is terrible and offensive to anybody who likes comedy."
2,"Tinny Echo, Spoils Golden Talent","This re-release has an annoying ""Tinny"" echo, especially noticible on the band track, that spoils an otherwise admirable outing. This is also the same problem with the ""Basie Swings/Bennett Sings"" CD. Hard to believe that modern recording savvy can't take this flaw out of re-issues. You may be a bigger Bennett fan than I (hard to believe) and be willing to wade through this major distraction. If so, have at it. As for me I'll be picking up ""The Art of Romance"", by Tony, instead, and regret the loss of a listenable ""Cloud 7"".Also Recommended: Bennett CDs : ""The Good Life"", ""Playin' With My Friends"", ""If I Ruled The World, Songs For The Jet Set"", and ""Astoria: Portrait of the Artist"""
3,Could be better...,This book doesn't give enough information about how and what negative items to dispute on your credit report to raise your credit score.
1,Never got my freekin order!!!,"I've had the most piss poor experience with this order. I bought a subscribtion for my boy on Christmas so that he might hopefully enjoy Mad Magazine the same way I enjoyed it when i was his age. Placed the gosh darn order before Cristmas. Was told that we wouldn't see the first issue till friggin April at the latest! They gave me an estimation of 14-16 weeks wich seemed ridiculous at the time but I thought that was an over estimation like most companies do. When they say 14 to 16 weeks the last thing you expect is that they actually go over the sixteen weeks, four whole months. Then when I comfronted them with this initial b.s., they tell me that there was some kind of snafu and that I should be getting my first copy in June!!! I lost it. I canceled the friggin order and now they.re telling me that I probably won't ge my money back for another four weeks. This is the second worst online shopping experience that I ever had. To be continued."
3,Simply not what it used to be...,"I started reading this magazine in the early 90's, when I was a kid. My dad had a few from the 60's and 70's, and I have expanded my collection since then to include a good amount from the 80's. That stuff was brilliant.Artists and writers die, we know that. New artists and writers can be good, but the MAD magazine of the 2000's isn't worth buying. Why did MAD start putting in ads? Wasn't it making enough money by itself? I loved MAD for the fact that it was ad-free, and the brilliant writing and artwork, laced with biting satire. Now, the humor in there is more of the ""potty humor"" level, and is the kind of thing juveniles laugh over.Now it's not worth the paper it's printed on, and CRACKED magazine has gone the same way and already ended publication several years ago. Last time I read a MAD magazine, I found myself completely bored and impatient with it, and wondering how such a great magazine could have become so lackluster."
5,my favorite book,"The Skystone is the best book I have ever read, and I read a lot. The battle descriptions and the detail are unparalleled. I highly recommend the book as well as Mr. Whyte's other books."
2,Good history/klunky writing,"Whyte's historical knowledge and presentation of 4th and 5th century life creates a credible and interesting background for this story. As a history buff, I am always looking for good writers in this vein. I have to say that I was disappointed by the writing style and the sledge hammer subtle plot development. The important points were emphasized and repeated ad nauseum to the point of distracting from the flow of the narrative. The romantic relationship with the principle woman was not very convincing or moving and I found myself skimming those passages rather than being moved by them. The characters seem somewhat 2 dimensional as well. Mr. Whyte has written many books on interesting subjects and time periods, but I doubt I will try any others since I was so bored with this one."
2,Big Disapointment,"I picked this up looking for a good summer read, and hoping to catch on to a new series. The premise looked promising,as well, and I will read anything with Romans in it.Well, while the premise is great, I felt I was reading 500 pages of story setup, with characters who sounded more like 20th century intellectuals than the people of the place and times.Story segments that could have been suspenseful where revealed over way to many Dinner conversations. My Dinner with Britanicus in Londinium would have been a better title.Still, the setup is fascinating enough that I will give the series another chance and get the sequel. Maybe the setup will be worth it. For now, I am just happy I borrowed this one, rather than bought it."
5,Excellent,"A great read for any fan of Arthurian legend!! The book intertwines the history of Roman occupied Britain with the legend of Excalibur and Arthur seamlessly. It's an engaging tale that I got easily wrapped up in. You learn so much about the characters through the wonderful writing. I didn't want to put it down until I got to the end, and then I just picked up the next book in the series and kept on reading."
5,Favorite book of all time,"This book is REALLY exceptional. This book my all time favorite, and I've read over 1,000 books already. The crafting and the point of view of a common grunt who rises through the ranks of the Roman legions is exquisitely done by Jack Whyte. Mike, age 12."
3,It Came Close to Being Very Good!,"Like other reviewers, I too picked up this book thinking it would be a different slant on the Arthur legend and it certainly delivered from this standpoint. However, I must agree that the characters were two dimensional, at best. The sex and violence of the book did not bother me as sex and violence are part of the human experience but the portrayl of women as simply ""cheerleaders"" for their men was a bit too simplistic. I did find the information regarding the collapse of the Roman empire fascinating and wonder about how people at this time must have felt with their society starting to crumble around them. Overall, I enjoyed the book and hope that in the sequels the characters are fleshed out a little more."
5,The Skystone Book 1,The book arrived shorly after we ordered it in very good condition. A pleasure doing business with you.Thank you.
2,Skystone Disappointing,"I am a long-time fan of fiction relating to King Arthur. However, I was very disappointed with Whyte's work. The sexual content is gratuitous; it did not relate to the plot in any way. The explicit descriptions of Varrus' frequent sexual encounters read like a male smut novel, Whyte's own fantasies. The female characters were flat. Luceiia did not live up to the foreshadowing of a strong, independent woman. As soon as Varrus saw her, the descriptions consisted of his lust for her physical beauty, and after the two slept together, Luceiia quickly faded into the background."
3,Historical accuracy? So what? The writing is lame.,"A decent book, kept my interest and entertained me. I read for entertainment and won't criticize this book for historical innaccuracies. I'll criticize it for being like a 500 page comic book as far as characters and dialogue is concerned. Unreal, fantastical cookie-cutter superheroes. But all in all worth reading for light entertainment if you can ignore the poor writing, ridiculous characters and their preposterous interactions."
1,Body Not So Bare,"Hello,(I trully hope you don't lose your money, because it trully hurts to buy something so expensive with high hopes).=( trust me, this doesn't work, i sadly bought both of them Body Bare and LAdyfair. I spent over $300.00 including s/h and boy was i dissapointed.I would like to say, that if you would like to purchase a personal trimmer or private area shaver you should think about it, i would like to tell you so that no one else is fooled by the looks or sites. I also bought everything with it! i got the entire combo and more. Since i wanted to be completely shaven without having to go through brazilian waxing pain i researched for over 2 weeks!!!!2 weeks! none stop to make sure i bought the right product. Body bare or Ladyfair are the same. These trimmers don't do anything, sadly a normal shaver is better than this. Plus it leaves BUMPS AND RASHES!!!!"
5,the best remover,"This is my ""go to"" can for removing stains, scuffs, adhesive, etc. from a variety of surfaces...most of them in my car. If this cannot remove it, then I know it is unlikely to be removed by anything else. I have never had it damage anything either, although I probably wouldn't use it in carpet or other fabric I could not rinse out. I've been using this product since about 2003 with no problemsI'd like to add that I have found this to be stronger and safer than both Goof Off and Oops. For example, those will readily dissolve plastic but I have not had Xenit do that"
2,Doesn't do much for me...,"I know almost immediately if I like a particular song on a CD, or a CD entirely. This one just did not grab my attention. In fact, I moved on to the next CD in my collection and I haven't picked this one up since. I agree with other online reviews that say this was a bit premature; it is apparent that others are not only writing for her, but telling her what to sing. When KiKi can write her own music about things that she's experienced, and furthermore bring those lyrics to life through execution, she will have a masterpiece on her hands! She has been given an awesome gift, and I look forward to hearing more from her in the future!"
4,"Great results, but takes time....","Like many people, I have exercised off and on throughout my adult life. This was the first weight training book I bought when I decided to get serious about fitness. Before this book, I never achieved the definition on my arms and upper body that I got with this. I do not know if it is the combination of exercises, the order, or the style, but it works for my body.Though I vary my routine with hers and other books and videos, I always come back to hers as the one most often used.Two complaints with this and her other books - I do not feel that her form is always correct for the lower body exercises. I have had a trainer who showed me the proper form, so I disregard hers in those cases. I also substitute exercises for ones I do not feel comfortable doing (i.e. sissy squat - killer on knees). The second are the diet tips. The book is somewhat dated, although she preaches many common-sense ideas. I feel there are more comprehensive guides out there for that."
4,Fat-Burning Workout: From Fat to Firm in 24 Days,"I followed this routine for several weeks and noticed a big difference in the definition and toning of my muscles. I work out outdoors, and unfortunately, left my book outside one day - came home to find the puppy enjoyed the book also. Can't wait to buy another copy. The one thing I disagree with, is the 24 days - come on!"
3,good if you like weights,"I tried both her books fat burning and bottoms up. Here are my complaints for the fat-buring workout:afterwards my muscles became so short and inflexible.Also, its too much too fast too soon. You should only start with 1 set with the weights.If you like weights go on, but I'm not going to sacrifice my flexibility and range of motion."
2,Not what we expected. Turns over & FLips too much!,Sure the idea is awesome. The pics are cool. But what fun is there if evrytime you get on you get rolled over on or flipped off? I think this is why my children became easliy bored and tossed this out of the pool. It's design is not right for some adventurous water play. They get more enjoyment watching it float out in th lake than playing in the pool with it.
3,oops there's a hole!,I was super fun for about 2 hours. Then it got a hole. Never was able to fix it.
5,one of the best holiday gift,"My dad is a very handy man. This is one of the Christmas gifts I gave him. Besides those other fancy stuffs, he like this one the best. It is a perfect tool in his tool box."
5,Great rebar finder,"After trying many other products that claimed they could find reinforcing steel in concrete (they couldn't), I gave this a try. It works great! No more drilling into steel to set anchor bolts."
5,Fabric Protectant Works well,"I live in South Florida where we get torrential rains and hot sun and I've been using this product bi-monthly on my 2005 Mustang black top. The top looks and repells like new. Couldn't ask for a better product for my needs. It's fairly easy to apply, although like previously stated, you need to hold the can 18"" or so off the top. It is difficult on a windy day. That aside, the product is a winner in my book."
3,Worked but was not enough in one can,"This spray worked for a little while on my ragtop 91 firebird but not long, I think you need more liek two cans per vehicle so you can really saturate it in the cloth top."
1,Useless,I purchased this product along with one of RaggTopp's cleaning solutions to try to stop my top from leaking. Product says it 'Restores Lost Water and Stain Repellency To Like Factory New'. This is an absolute lie. Cleaned and applied multiple coats to my top. During the next heavy rainstorm the inside of my roof was completely saturated with water.
4,Cover up windows.,"I like how it works, but overspray on windows was hard to remove. Also I have to order another can to feel like I got it sealed good. The water still didn't bead like it said except on the side sails where I got a third like coat. that's why I gave it 4 star."
5,Outstanding railroad nostalgia,"Don Ball's book shows in brilliant photography a railroad and a nation in its prime. Crisp color photography throughout. If there is a business to represent America when there were no doubts, this is it. Steam, electric, diesel, it's all here. And a surprising amount of classic images of other roads as well as the Pennsy borrowed power from the eastern US to make its manifests.This book is simply a joy for rail enthusiasts. I am pleased to add it to my collection."
2,"Dog loved it, but it didn't last","I bought the Ghost for my pup and he absolutely loved it- it was his favorite toy- he'd play with it for hours. The sound got him really excited and he'd even take it outside with him. Unfortunately, the ghost's mouth is made of rather thin cloth and it didn't take long for it to rip and be destroyed. If the mouth were made of the same material as the body, this would be the perfect toy for my dog."
3,Sansa e200 Series Accessories,"For the price the accessories are adequate for recharging the Sansa e260 they sent me.The only complaint is the length of the cord on the car charger. It is extremely short!Even in a small car like our old Ford Escort when I plug the charger into the dashboard accessories socket and then into the MP3 Player, the cord is so short that the player just hangs down on the floor of the car. There isn't enough cord for it to reach far enough to sit on the seat."
1,Chargers don't work,I bought these chargers because I read other reviews that said they work well. When I got mine I tried the home charger and I had to shove it into my Sansa 4GB player because it wouldn't fit and it didn't even work. I also got one for my sister and hers did the same thing. I didn't even bother trying the car charger because I was only interested in the home charger to begin with. I think you are taking a 50/50 chance by buying these. Apparently they work for some people but not others. I returned mine. Hopefully Sandisk will come out with an inexpensive charger like this soon.
3,verdict still out,The wall charger sometimes charges unit fully and other times only partially charges. I haven't used the car unit for any length but it does turn on and the charge signal does come on.
5,One of my favorite books!,I just loved this book! It was really funny and you could see everything in Daisy's life actually happening! Read this book if you want a laugh or two!
3,A blend of XP and Open Source Tools,"Good for those who'd like to find out an intro level information on XP and Open source tools, such as Ant, JUnit, Cactus, HttpUnit, JMeter, JPerf.What I don't like is Part III of the book, is a really [bad]. It contains references to ANT Tasks, and API reference for the open source library (150 pages). This is a deadly sin that I hate most in a book, besides it's not easy to carry the additional 150 pages around."
4,Off to a good start,"Detective William Murdoch is called to a crime scene. A young woman has been found nude and dead in the snow. It is apparent she is not a street person or street person, but she is pregnant, had been given opium and smothered. Murdoch's challenge is to find out who she is and who killed her.It was refreshing to read an historical mystery set in Canada. Ms. Jennings did an admirable job of creating a sense of time and place. Murdoch is an interesting character, particularly his relationship to his friends and dead fiancée. There were very interesting secondary characters spanning all economic levels. The motive was never quite clear to me, but I appreciated that Ms. Jennings tied up all the story lines at the end. It was a very enjoyable read and I look forward to others in the series."
5,"The music is fine, but where are the words?","After viewing Zeffirelli's version of the movie for all of the 16 years I have taught Romeo and Juliet, this music is almost my theme song. I am, however, looking for a soundtrack that combines both the music and selected cuttings from the movie. If anyone knows where I might obtain such an item, I'd appreciate the information. Thanks!"
5,A Romantic Masterpiece,"""It's a really beautiful CD to listen to, and then you get to ""Romeo And Juilet Are Wed"". Your heart breaks the second you hear the voice, angelic and pure, singing to the two young lovers."
3,Not either the best of Lennon or of Nilsson,"Lennon was a great songwriter and singer without question, but I think his hand at production leaves something to be desired. Drowning in reverb and double-tracking, it sounds like a counterpart to ""Rock and Roll Music"" to me, and that's not a compliment (it's one of my least faves).Harry on the other hand trashed his voice on this album, which is sad and interesting. I have this feeling that Nilsson's voice was destined for trashing anyway, given his self-abusive lifestyle. In the end, it's Nilsson somehow sounding like he was trying to be Lennon.I've heard the album maybe 4-5 times, and I like it. Maybe 3-1/4 of 5 stars. I just don't like the Spector influence of the production."
4,Great Resource for anyone looking into this career field,"Opens your eyes to the wide variety of jobs in this career field.Good book for an environmental student, in their senior year."
2,Less Than OK Picture Quality,"I bought this about 3 months ago and I've noticed a terrible picture quality. I've even set up my computer for the resolution, white balance, etc. with my tv, and the color is terrible. It is also extremely pixilated. You could buy a cheap dvd player for the same price with better quality."
1,Frustrated,"I bought this item because I believed the other reviewers that it would just ""work"" but sadly it doesn't do anything like the ""don't bother"" reviewer says. The frustrating thing is that since it doesn't work there's no trouble-shooting advice, no help line, and no further instructions online.I know with components that you have to try them several different ways or restart, etc. but after doing all of this multiple times I still get nothing.The instructions say:1. Put your iBook to sleep.2. Plug iTV Link into your TV and your iBook3. Wake-up your iBook4. You can now play your iPhoto or iMovie project or DVD on your TV.As you can imagine- if it works you're pleased. If if doesn't then you're left with nothing. I would have liked some trouble-shooting tips at least."
3,Almost perfect,"I bought these earrings to wear on my wedding day as my wedding ring is an emerald ring. I was slightly disappointed as the emeralds are very light, not the deep green that you can see in the picture. I nearly tried to send them back and ask for deeper green to be sent out, but there wasn't time before my wedding day. I chose to keep them as they are lovely and delicate, a bit smaller than you would imagine, very pretty, but if you are expecting a deep emerald green you might be disappointed.They seemed quite expensive for what they were when they arrived.I have no regrets about buying, they arrived very quickly and in good condition, and I did wear them on my wedding day, but I was not 100% happy with the product and wish the emeralds were deeper."
2,not worth the money,"The little straw thing won't stay on while spraying, it has to be held on to work. I'll never buy this brand again.Also, I saw someone else wrote on a review that it doesn't have ""bitterent"" (?)... that stuff that leaves a film on the keyboard and a bad taste on your skin... well maybe it doesn't have that ""bitterent"" stuff, but the skin on my hands where I touched the keyboard definitely have a bitter taste. I stopped using this product because of it and because of the problem with the strawn."
4,Stoner 94203 Gust Easy Air Duster,"The product arrived well packaged. No problems with order. Would have liked a quicker response, but did arrive in time."
5,Works perfectly,There is no more dust on my laptop keyboard. It even fixed a few key that were hard to push.
4,"Probably The Best Deal Out There, Although Pressure Can Be Better","This is undoubtedly one of the best deals around for canned air, cheap and I got it pretty fast even with Free Super Saver Shipping. It works great although for dust that has been accumulated for quite some time is not that effective, it takes the outer layers but it leaves the dust layers in direct contact with the object. I tried it on a keyboard and I'll have to use either a stronger canned air or a liquid product (in this case I guess no canned air would do the trick)One advice: Read the fine print. If you are accustomed to use canned products you may shake the can from time to time just as you would do with canned paint or cleaners, but what this will do is just reduce the flow of air our of the nozzle and reduces its overall effectiveness"
5,Searching for your parents,"A mutual acquaintance of mine and the author's sent me this book, knowing my own father served in the Marines during World War II. My dad always told funny stories about his experience, but never anything unpleasant. This book helped me see what my dad's experience must have been like. It reminded me of another book, After Long Silence, in which a woman's search for her parents'WWII era secrets unlocks whole aspects of their personalities theretofore unknown to her. I'm not a war or history buff, but I recommend this for anyone who asks, ""what were my parents like when they were young?"" or wonders about the experiences that shaped their parents' views."
2,Falls flat,"After reading A Kiss of Fate I had high hopes for this hard cover, but Mary Jo Putney's newest novel fell flat. There is no suspense, no tension, no conflict between characters. Everything is laid out and explained for the reader. It's a real snooze! Add to it that the author tells us what a character's personality is like, but doesn't have the character act appropriately. Jack Langdon despises magic? Well, he sure doesn't act like it. Even the ""attraction"" between the main characters is deflated and uninspired. In fact, this entire book is deflated and uninspired. It starts out like the next installment of Harry Potter, by the way. Don't waste your money."
1,Not user friendly,"We had our contractor install these and he even had a hard time putting them in. The magnet wasn't strong enough to go through our wood cabinets, so we were afraid we'd get locked out of our cabinets. He ended up uninstalling them. We paid for an hour of his labor with no success. I do not recommend these!"
2,Poor construction quality,"I purchased this item after reading the positive reviews here at Amazon.It arrived today and I am pretty disappointed about the poor quality of construction. The box overall is somewhat flimsy and can easily be twisted and bent (it feels like thin leather wrapped over a cardboard body frame).The latch sticks, so it doesn't operate smoothly or easily and the lid doesn't open quite enough to balance properly so it sometimes falls closed by itself.On the plus side, the interior pockets and features are nicely appointed in cushy-soft velvet and the watch holders fit my watches nicely and snugly.I had thought that at this median price the build quality and fit/finish would be better. It is disappointing enough that I will probably buy something else."
4,At least as good as advertised,"Clean construction, lots of compartments for all my stuff, plus plenty of room for my selection of watches. Would recommend."
4,Yaktrax Walker Ice Cleats - Black - Small,"Pretty pleased with these. The coils do make the bottom of your shoe slightly uneven, so it takes a little while to get used to that, but they really will save you from slipping if your winter involves a lot of ice. The coils grip onto the slick ice and I can walk out on any of our frozen lakes here with no problem. Great for getting around town on bad days! Be sure to take them off indoors: if the coils don't have anything to grip onto they can be really slick (i.e. grocery store floor linoleum.)"
2,"Good idea, but quality has gone downhill","I bought my first yak-trax walker years ago and they lasted 3 years. I just got a new pair at Christmas and they didn't even last 3 months. I walk 3 to 5 times a week, 3-4 miles each time, on slippery sidewalks and a roughly cleared wildlife sanctuary trail near Minneapolis, MN. I wouldn't take my daily hikes down the trail without them, but I'm very disappointed in the quality. I may try the pro model next, but from the pictures they don't look any better. If you're willing to buy 1 or 2 pairs each winter, then I recommend them for the stability I get from them, but you're going to have to buy 1 or 2 pairs each winter."
5,Love this product,"First, the service was excellent and the order arrived within just a few days.I love my Yaktrax. In the past I've worn Stabilicers, which I also recommend. However, I prefer the Yaktrax for two reasons: 1) The ends of the Yaktrax flip up over my shoes, so my shoes are somewhat protected from the elements and they are easier to put on. This is important when shopping, as the Yaktrax must be removed upon entering a store, and put back on when venturing back outside (same w/ the Stabilicers). 2) The sole of the Yaktrax are made in a coil pattern and seem to grip snow and icy surfaces more solidly.In sizing I prefer the flexibility of ordering on the larger side. That way the Yaktrax are slightly large when worn w/ my regular shoes, but also accommodate my winter boots.Highly recommend for icy weather."
3,the good the bad and the ugly,I previously bought a similar product that had spikes; it cut holes in my wood floors. This product did not cut holes but also failed to provide as much traction on icy sidewalks and I nearly fell when encountering black ice. The plastic is about as durable as that of competitors and has broken after a few months of use. Would probably be fine for someone who does not walk much but for every day usage there must be a better (albeit more expensive) alternative.
3,Buy the YakTrax Pros instead!,"These are perfectly adequate cleats. They do a great job of keeping you from slipping and provide excellent traction. However, shortly after I bought them, one of my cleats came loose somewhere and was lost. I should've listened to all the reviewers who recommended the YakTrax Pro model; they are a much better investment because they have a strap that keeps them more firmly affixed to your shoes so they don't come loose and go flying, never to be seen again."
2,"Good traction, but poor durability","I walk 1 1/2 miles every morning, and use these in the winter when we have snow and ice on the sidewalks. In less than 1 week two of the rubber straps on the bottom broke. I wired the remaining straps together so I can still use them for the time being, but obviously this is not the durability I expected. The traction is fine, except for smooth ice."
1,"2 months, tops.","The product absolutely works, but you're lucky if you get more than 2 months out of a pair. All they would have to do is solder/weld the wires closed, but instead, they have very strong, lose, sharp wires wrapped around rubber. Also, the product has a tenancy to fall off your shoes midstride at random times.Do not buy."
1,Beware Dangerous!,"If you use these, make sure you inspect them before each use. The rubber framework is not very resilient and can break. While running, my Yak broke and I stepped on the broken piece. I subsequently tripped and landed on my face. I broke a tooth and it became imbedded in my lip. I needed oral surgery to remove the tooth. This is not an isolated incident. I know another runner whose Yaks broke and got caught on her pants. She fell on her face. She has been told that she may need numerous root canals on her damaged front teeth. I will either try spikes or just put up with a little slipping and sliding. These things are just too dangerous."
2,work but broke quickly,These yaktrax were purchased to use on a vacation in the mountains in the winter. They provided excellent traction control but bot of the shoe covers broke after 2 uses. Thankfully Amazon customer service is wonderful and provided full refunds.
3,Greatest invention ever!... if only they would stay on my shoes,"I can't give these less than 3 stars. After watching my strong, young husband reduced to a stooped near-invalid by whiplash after he fell on black ice, I'm a believer in ice cleats. They don't look terribly chic, but neither does an arm cast. They lose 2 points, though, because while his stay on his big Timberland boots, mine don't stay on my slightly-more-ladylike waterproof boots. They're the right size and all, but my boots don't have a ""ledge"" where the sole meets the boot, and the Yaktrax have an annoying habit of popping off in the middle of the sidewalk. Many's the time I've backtracked for a Yaktrax, retracing my steps amidst the snow-narrowed sidewalks of Brooklyn to find the lost cleat. Are you one of the unlucky ones whose shoes won't hold these on? You'll never know until you buy them. And that's why I can't give them more than three stars."
3,Worked before they broke,"I purchased these last season to help a new Michigander not fall on her butt while clearing a sizeable driveway. Now that I've moved into a new house with a 15% graded driveway, these are an absolute MUST. However, after just two uses this season they have snapped (both feet) and are no longer usable.This may have been exacerbated by my fiance wearing my pair on accident and stretching them out. We'll have to get some new pairs and see what happens."
5,Great gift for elderly people who still want to go out in the snow each day.,These yaktrax are exception. They are so easy to take on and off. They are great for older folks who still like to get out and about in the snow.
1,Good for to and from mailbox only,"We bought 4 pairs of these for our family. After 5 miles of walking on a flat, paved (but snow covered) walkway, the rubber broke on the first one. After 12 miles 2 pairs were completely broken. After 22 miles all 4 pairs were destroyed. We only walked on snow covered trails a few miles a day so this was extremely disappointing. We threw away all 4 pairs.These do have good traction and are comfortable to wear. Also, with all the walking (times 4 people) we only slipped twice collectively. As others have noted, with prolonged walking they do tend to slip off. During our entire excursion they fell off about 3 times. You have to constantly check to make sure they are on."
5,Ice Walker Trax,"Excellent product and excellent supplier. These (2) are not the first ones I've bought. Very prompt delivery. I have a very steep, long driveway with my mailbox on the road. Excellent traction when I have to walk on the ice-covered driveway!!!!"
4,"Great item, will buy again!","These are great! What I like best is that they are not sharp to the touch and they are not heavy to wear. Some types are sharp and I worry about hurting myself when taking them off, but these are great. I did notice a few times one would come off one foot, but I easily put them back on. I do agree that they should not be worn inside on a tile or slippery floor, you could fall down. The pros far outweigh the cons and it sure beats slipping and falling on your bum on the ice like I did before the Yaktrax!"
4,Good traction on Ice,Love these things. They slide over the boots and improve my traction greatly.Haven't fallen once since I got them.
1,Disappointed,"I walk to work about 3/4 a mile each way. After a week, one of the cleats snapped. The rubber that was covered with the metal spring just snapped, I couldn't believe it. I am so disappointed."
1,Not happy at all with product,"The second time I wore these hiking the both broke on my feet, and it was very dangerous going back down the mountin. I would not recommend them to anyone, and I will never purchase them again."
4,no more sore butt!,2 years ago i was taking public transportation to work and boy you wouldn't want to be walking on snow without a good traction under your foot... i'm the one who would always slip and ofcourse i hate it then one day i was blogging about how scared i am to walk on a snow when a friend of mine recommended this...bought one right away...never failed me so far and my most favorite experience w/ my yaktrax was this one time when there's blizzard in philadelphia and i have to go to new york (which eventually caught up on the blizzard too) to attend a formal function...i had to walk a few blocks to and from the train station and wearing a formal shoes is really not a good idea when walking on snow on a blizzard but my yak trax saved the day! it fits perfectly on my high boots without making my boots look hideous...i'll be posting a photo...look for[...]
1,Great until they fell off!,"I was so happy when my Yaktrax walker traction device came in the mail today, I immediately put them on (carefully) to run some errands, it's pretty icy here in Maine. Within 5 minutes, both of them had slipped off and I lost one. I was pretty happy with the Yaktrax Pro Ice Walkers that I used last winter but they were hard to put on. These lighter Traction Device Walkers were much easier to put on and clearly easy to remove, much too easy! I can't even return them as I now only have one. I am going back to the Pro Ice Walkers, the velcro trap keeps them on my shoes where they belong. I do not recommend these lighter weight ones without the strap, they sure didn't last long!"
5,Yaktracks in icy northern Michigan!,"My YakTracks work everybit as good and better than expected! I have been running/walking on hard packed snowy and icy roads in the U.P. of Michigan and have not slipped! Wonderful product, I see everyone else out and about with this same brand on!"
3,a little disappointed,This book doesn't talk as much about social settings as it does about mean girls in the business world.
5,Goodness in every Bowl,These bowl's of steamed brown rice are great!I think this product tastes great (As Brown Rice goes)I seldom want to wait for brown rice to cook after working a 10 hour shift.My only complaint is that you blow through them quickly.Better Buy 2 packs!
4,A poet at the beginning of a long and fruitful career.,"I would give Ms. Sarrocco five stars, but I believe that there is more and even better work to come from this poet. ""Karate Bride"" is reminiscent of the work of Mary Dorcey and Carol Ann Duffy; edgy, controlled, and brilliantly executed. This is poetry for the ear and not the eye, as Sylvia Plath so memorably described ""Ariel."" Buy ""Karate Bride"" and read it aloud. The experience is gripping."
4,good stand but it came broken,"I like the printer stand. However it came with one fold-out wing broken off. With the help of some wood glue and a few C-clamps the piece is now very nice and no one will know that it had a problem when it arrived. If you are not too handy, perhaps you don't want to take a chance on this piece of furniture."
1,Inaccurate description at Amazon,"I thougt I bought a book (hard copy), and even got a shipping date and estimate arrival... Once the book did not arrive, the supplier told me he offered a PDF copy.I finally got the copy (even thought it was not what I ordered), but it is a poor quality scan of the book. This will be the last book I buy at Amazon marketplace"
2,Muddled and Mis-Titled,"As someone that studies voting behavior in the US, I had hoped this book would provide me with some insight into the voting patterns & behavior of Muslim-Americans. I was sorely mistaken. As it turns out, this book is essentially just Tahir Ali's autobiography as it pertains to his involvement in the movement to get Muslim-Americans to vote. While it certainly appears his contributions to that effort have been substantial, the title of the book implies something that it clearly is not.If you are looking for background and historical context regarding Muslim-American voting movement, this book would likely prove a good ancillary. If you are looking for discussions of turnout rates, partisan ideology, or quantitative analysis, you will be disappointed. This book is really a first person account of Muslim voting activism, not a scholarly work of any substance."
4,I love this stuff!,I am so grateful for this decaf/sugar free chai. I have Addison's Disease and had to have emergency gastric bypass surgery and cannot have caffeine or sugar. I love Chai and was afraid I couldn't have anymore. I searched everywhere and finally found this. The little coffee shop in my town is going to order it for me. It is great!
5,Delicious Product,This is an excellent tasting tea. And the fact that it's decaf and sugar free makes it all the more delicious. Will be back for more.
4,Hang in there - it's worth it!,"I've read the entire Richard Jury series and love it! This is the first stand alone novel of Grimes' that I've read. The book does start out slow, but gains speed after the appearance of the assasins and just gets better from there. It really turns out to be a great read from a great author! Hang in there!"
1,Too bad it was boring,"Martha Grimes used to write excellent novels. Her Richard Jury novels are examples of meticulous and interesting plot and characters. I kept forcing myself to read the next chapter, wondering where it would get interesting. By Chapter 11, I decided I had much better things to do than hope that her previous novels had guaranteed her future novels to be worth reading. Quite a disappointment."
1,Disappointing,"I just could not get into reading this book all the way through. It is boring. It starts off slow, boring, too detailed, and just something I can't get into. I will never be able to finish it. Life is much too short."
3,Where is the book and play along CD?,"The DVD is great, but...1. 2.0 leads me to think of a revision, not Volume II. This is Volume II, you should get Volume I first. This DVD starts at the 48th groove, not the 1st one.2. A play along CD is mentioned throughout the DVD, but is not included.3. A book is mentioned throughout the DVD, but is not included.The DVD is very well done and comes with a poster with all of the grooves written out. Unfortunately they are very small, hard to read, and not very portable. Sheet music would have been better.I highly recommend Groove Essentials 2.0, but recommend getting Volume I first and getting the book and CD."
4,A Little Girl's Dream Doll,"The Glinda doll captures everything you loved about the movie character as a child. She is in a sparkly pink gown, with a puffed skirt and puffed sleeves. Her curly, strawberry blonde hair and dimpled face are lovely. Glinda's voice recording is surprisingly accurate. What disappointed me about this doll, however, was the quality of her crown and wand - both are plastic and look pretty cheap. Because this is a very low priced collector doll, though, the buyer still gets a great Barbie for the money. I recommend Glinda for Wizard of Oz fans or for girls who love princess dolls."
4,Yes it will help you sleep,"I got both the Sound Sleep and Deep Sleep from Kelly Howell. I prefer the deep sleep. But if I just need to unwind, release a little tension, maybe take a short doze on the couch, I will use this tape. I really think it is a preference thing. The deep sleep one seems to knock me out 9 out of 10 times. The Sound Sleep seems to ease my tension. There is no talking on either cd. It's new agey peaceful music, earthy.I would say that if you just seem to need to drift away from reality for a little while in order to fall asleep, this would be fine. If you need a little back noise for sleeping this will certainly help. If you need to de-stress."
3,"OK, not fabulous","Howell's ""Guided..."" relaxation, etc tapes/CDs are better. I haven't used it much but it could be worse. There's no tinkling piano doing riffs as far as I recall."
1,A Guru spouting Pseudoscience,"Why does this book feel like a big con to me?First of all none of the author's ideas are falsifiable, meaning that they do not fall remotely into the realm of science because they can neither be dis-proven nor tested. So what he's done is basically create a cult/religion that makes him money.The premise of the book is that the emotionally charged first memories we all have of certain concepts and products guide our decision making subconsciously. This is an interesting idea, but he always presents it in a vague enough way that it is impossible to test, and never once does he challenge the idea himself.It disturbs me that so many people can't see the bs going on here.The author is unquestionably talented at marketing himself and stirring up controversy. If he wrote a book on how to do that I'd buy it."
3,Good insight,"Good insight into why we think and act as we do, but the author does not write an in-depth depiction of any one subject. Instead, he only covers items in general, and does not do as great of a job as I expected comparing US culture to other cultures. Overall, it is a good read with some good insight."
4,If other cultures interest you,"You'll find this book very interesting if you enjoy reading about other cultures. It's easy reading and you'll find out how other cultures live and how they buy. For instance, Americans buy automobiles according to how the vehicle makes them feel and Germans buy automobiles with engineering in mind.....Great for conversation."
3,not bad,"They are ok. One pair started coming apart, but that might just be from good ol' fashion hard training. I think I would prefer the mexican wraps. I prefer for my wraps to come up higher on my arm, but that is just my preference."
2,Poor quality. Ripped after first wash.,"After I washed the handwraps for the first time, they started to rip and fray at the edges. It is pretty pointless if you can't wash them, because they get disgusting during a session of kickboxing. Anyways, I recommend the 'combat sports' handwraps. They seem to be more flexible and comfortable as well! ;)"
1,Too Short for Adults...,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing these. If you are going to do contact striking work (heavy bag, mitt work, etc.) then you need to protect your hands, and these wraps are too short for adults.I have replaced them with longer ""professional"" wraps from Everlast, which are the proper length for adult hands."
3,Fine for smaller hands,"I shared the 3 pack with a friend who is 5'6"" (I'm 5'0""). She thought the wraps weren't long enough to wrap around her hands completely. I thought they were fine."
3,Kick Boxing Perfect.,"The wraps all work for my use. I use these wraps during the week for Fitness kickboxing. The quality of these wraps are OK, they hold up to normal wear and tear. The velcro works well to hold them in place, one issue I have found is that the wrist and thumb hole do not tell you which side is down. So if you do not pay attention you can put the wrap on then the velcro will be on the wrong side. Overall this is a good product and when I purchased them the price was almost equal to buy two get one free, compared to purchasing them at a local sporting goods store."
2,Ok Wraps,"These are decent wraps, they are just small and kind of cheap. For a beginner who is starting to train they could be fine but for an experienced boxer they will not be of high enough quality."
2,Ripped on first use,"I am a female with small hands, so did not notice any problems with the length as mentioned in previous reviews. However, the velcro portion ripped from the wrap the very first time I went to take them off. Would not purchase again."
5,The toughest of them all!,"I just have to say that Aly and Aj are the best singers I've heard yet, well, enxt to Raven Symone and Hilary Duff, but who can hate them!? They write thier own songs, and ACTUALLY sing it instead of lip syncing it in some of thier videos. Also, they have instrumental talen sinc they can both play guitars! Now that I think about it, ALy and AJ or top of my list while Raven is second and Hilary is third. The three best music artist that I have seen come from Disney."
4,other stuff to check out,I am a huge fan of catchy melodic girl rock/pop. If you enjoy this album then I strongly recommend that you check out the following:1) Jalopy Go Far by Zolof The Rock and Roll Destroyer2) Ready 2 Pop by Miss Mary3) An Illustrated History by Puffyamiyumi
3,OH!!,"I guess i was mortaly disappointed. I think Aly & AJ have the voice to do much better than this cd. But other than that, it's a great album!"
2,I Wish That I Had Just Bought The One Song,"I bought this CD because I really liked the song ""Rush"", which was used as a theme song for the WNBA last year (2007). It's the only good song on the CD. To me, all of the other songs on the CD sound like a variation of ""Rush"" and all of the songs seem to just run together. I found myself actually being glad when the last song on the CD was over. And on top of that, I must have got a defective CD, because my CD sounded muffled and ""muddy"". I thought that my CD player had gone bad, so I took ""Into The Rush"" out and put another CD in. Nope, the CD player was just fine - the CD was bad. I'm happy to have the song ""Rush"" in my music collection, but I wish that I had just downloaded that one song. I gave this CD two stars because of ""Rush"". All of the other songs get zero stars."
2,Don't RUSH To Buy This!,"I like the song ""Rush"" a lot. Good lyrics and the girls have good harmonies together. Their harmonies are pretty good throughout the album actually.My problem with this CD is that there is not originality to it...we have heard it all before with Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff etc... Nothing new or exciting that stands out on this CD. I realize that they come from the whole Disney background and maybe that's where and why I get lost in this pop fluff. I can see where kids would like it But, it is just too predictible with it's chours's and guitars that make each song bleed into the next making it sound like one long song!I do give it 2 stars though because they DO have good voices they just need to use them in a way that is not so formulatic."
5,See this movie.,"This is the most entertaining nine minutes of motorsports you will ever see. It's real and you will never see anything else like it. See the October 11, 1993 page 38 review in Autoweek magazine. Car and Driver says it's one of the ""Ten best car movies we've ever seen""."
3,Interesting and strange,"I enjoyed this book but it could have done without some of the sexual scenes.It had good characters,an awesome story,and lots of twists in her life.She is a strong woman with a confusing past and future . She has to figure out what she wants and what she needs to do.It was great but different.I totally recommend it for people into the fantasy romance deal."
1,KEEP YOUR DAUGHTERS MINDS IN MIND,"Think about it. Do you really want your daughters to play with this kind of toy. In a world dominated by idols with perfect bodies and extreme sex-appeal, Barbie is just another way of letting young girls know that having a great body is a must in our world.Instead of giving them toys with such a great focus on an impossibly perfect body, give them toys that may develop their minds. Take a look in the stores, teir full of great toys for your kids."
5,Whatever happened to the Laughter,Ok this is my first review on amazon so please forgive me if it's not the best one you've read. An old friend of mine that used to host an industrial radio show at Kenyon College turned me onto this band. Thank you Ryan Parks where ever you are. You want a musical depsricption? In two words: Industrial Disco! It's great. The lyrics are humorous and the music is heavy guitars and dance beats. I don't know why they never made another album. They found a niche that was previously untapped and without them is still untapped. They could have been huge. I saw in one of the other reviews that someone got to see them live. I'm so jealous. This is a great album just buy a used one if you. I guarantee you want be disappointed.
3,Replacements---,Not sure if the dog ate these yet or not. But I purchased as replacments for the originals that were previously eaten by the dog.
5,Excellent source to learn how to control your anger.,I used to have a very violent temper. I would get so angry that I would actually black out and not remember anything I said or did. This became a problem as you can see. I bought this book and it saved my life. I took what this book said and used it and I have had no problems since.
3,RAGGTOPP Convertible Top Care Kit - Fabric Review,"I purchased this item as I wanted to protect my convertible top. I found few if any completive brands, and felt there was little choice but to use this product. The pricing, I felt, was extremely high but there was little else to compare it to. Amazon had the best price that I could find, therefore I selected to go through Amazon. Amazon delivered and I am very pleased with that service.As for Raggtop, The cleaner did very well and I was well pleased with it. The sealer protection did OK, there was not enough to put three coats on the top as recommended, I was able to apply two coats. I see some water protection on the top, but I am not impressed with the results."
1,does not work,i purchased this product to clean my vinyl 2006 mustang convertable top based on the reviews on amazons web site. the top on the car is a little over a year old. well i can tell you now that this product does not work. i tried cleaning the same spot multiple times. each time the same result. the heavy dirt spots are still there . i used a brush to scrub each spot. it is almost laughable when the directions tell you to use a cloth.i followed the instructions 3 different times. the top is still dirty.this product is useless overpriced snake oil.
5,Adorers will love this book!,This book is so amazing for any adorer of Jesus! Paul Thigpen gets it right on the money every time.
4,Easy Sci-Fi,"Not my usual subject interest, but unique storyline. Had interesting and creative ""alien"" quirks. Definitely easy reading. Kept my interest till the end. Would consider reading a sequel."
4,Bettie Page,Excellent Movie. Gretchen Mol was a very good likeness for Bettie! I'll recommend this movie to any Bettie Page fan!
4,A pleasant journey in the past,"Bettie Page is a living legend and without her as an inspiration Dita Von Teese would have done another job. The movie puts in evidence that Bettie was naive and never vulgar: the extraordinary beauty of her naked body was a gift of God to share instead of a shame to hide. Unfortunately she was punished by the hypocrisy of the same American society which, years later, became slave of Playboy culture as international symbol of female sexually-beauty ambition. Bettie left the businness to dedicate herself to her private life and family but her photos (expecially the bondage ones) made a page of history of fashion. The film is truly nice and it's really impressive the recreation of many aspects of the ordinary life in the 1940s."
4,The P. The D. The I. The D.....it's Diddy.....Hold Up!!!!!,"(...) Damn Puf!!!!!This is a good insight into the Rise and Fall of Sean ""Puffy"", ""P-Diddy"" Combs. And I use to admire the guy. Despite the Haters. Read this and it may change your mind, as it did mine."
1,A truly useless book,"When this series started 20+ years ago, it was interesting and fresh. Now it merely looks old,out-of-date and worthless. Suzy's editorial style is intensely irritating. She's a fashionista who couldn't be less interested in anything you can't wear. And I agree with the other reviewers - most of it is years out of date."
3,"A little confusing, but not bad...","The writer obviously has talent, and the plot itself is fast-paced, with good twists and turns. It did keep me guessing all the way to the end. The plot is VERY original -- no ordinary strokes of the pen here - the author is definitely poised to be a trailblazer in the arena of pulp fiction.However, I must also say that there are shifts in voice that are quite perplexing in this book. For example, there are a few chapters where both the protagonist and her brother are speaking in first person -- with NO breaks to show the shift in perspective. So, I found myself reading backwards to find out from what perspective the thoughts were eminating. It gets a little confusing to read whole paragraphs where two characters are both speaking in terms of ""I"".All in all, I would say the novel is fresh, funny, fast, and gutsy. I am, however, looking forward to the author's next novel, to see if the prose structure is more traditional than this."
1,"I tried, but couldn't get rid of the odor","I really wanted to love this tea kettle, it is so gorgeous! Unfortunately, like many other reviews stated, it has a bad chemical odor that just wouldn't go away. I washed it, boiled 6 full pots of water, boiled a water/vinegar mix a few times, and even let lemons soak in it.The smell just wouldn't go away. I made some tea and tried to ignore it but I just couldn't get the chemical smell AND taste to dissipate."
2,This is my second Capresso,"Pros: closed interior stainless steel housing; rapid boiling; attractive design; easy to clean; visible water level.Cons: my first unit: the ""chrome"" application peeled off the top, which was unsightly; most importantly, the unit stopped working completely after 2+ years. Undaunted, I purchased another thinking it had run it's lifetime.my second unit: In less than 9 months, it's working sporadically. It turns on, then stops before the boil, with the switch remaining in the ""on"" position, sometimes turning on again after a few minutes. I want this to work because I don't see an adequate alternative. Time to complain to Capresso and pay for shipping. Feh."
1,Noxious fumes from plastic lid liner,"We used this teapot for a week and the strong odor from the heating of the plastic on the inside of the lid did not go away. I began to experience some physical problems and eventually realized they were connected with the pot. My symptoms cleared up after removing the pot from the kitchen. Right now the pot is in storage. Hopefully the smell will begin to dissapate so I can use it in the future. If you have chemical sensitivities, stay away from this pot. I purchased it because it was glass and I was trying to get away from plastics. You cannot tell from looking at the picture that the lid is lined with black plastic. I would not recommend this pot to a friend and do not feel comfortable to even give it away to someone else."
2,Returned,"I bought this electric kettle and promptly returned it. The water that I boiled had a strange chemical smell (like burning plastic). I tried using vinegar, baking soda, etc. to remove the unpleasant taste, but it didn't work.I purchased a Breville stainless steel electric kettle instead. There aren't any unpleasant tastes with the stainless steel kettle."
2,Beautiful kettle but stopped working after less than a year,"While it still worked, it was wonderful. It was a thing of beauty and I loved seeing it on my counter and loved watching the water boil. However, less than a year later, it simply stopped working. I replaced it with a Hamilton Beach for half the price, and that one is still going strong two years later."
2,The top will bubble up.,The top lid is covered in simulated chrome over plastic which will bubble up around the edge in one year or less. This is what happened to our kettle--it is still a pretty glass and all and is an enjoyment to use but the fact that in one year the lid needs to be replaced (if you want to maintain cuteness) is appalling.
5,Capresso Electric Water Kettle,"I have never been more delighted with a product!! It's easy to keep clean, looks nice on the counter, water boils quickly and the cord winds up under the base so that there is not a mile of cord snaking across the counter. I liked the kettle so much, I bought one for my Mother-In-Law.UPDATE: 2+ years later, still love this product! I use it everyday!"
2,Glass Shattered,"The kettle worked well for about a month. Appeared well designed and boiled quickly, but..... My wife was using the kettle to boil water for tea and the glass shattered as she picked it up. Luckily, she wasn't scalded. I won't be buying another one of these kettles. I don't want to risk another accident and there are other designs that work just as well."
1,Looks Great - Smells and Tastes Bad,"Kettle looks great and heats water quickly. Unfortunately, a bad chemical odor and taste is imparted to the water, possibly from a piece of plastic in the bottom. After boiling over 20 kettles of water, some with vinegar and some with lemon juice as directed by Capresso customer service, we still had bad odor and taste. Capresso customer service never answered any questions about the plastic and what it was made of. We finally gave up and returned it. BTW, its made in China."
4,Excellent,"This Kettle is really quiet compared to the last kettle I had which was a Krups, and sounded like a tractor. For the first couple of weeks I found there was a plastic smell when the kettle boiled but it wears off after a while. It looks great."
4,Beautiful kettle,We love the look of the pot and watching it boil. The only reason we gave it 4 stars is that we had to do the descaling process to get rid of a weird taste in the water. The lid also lets off a plastic smell after boiling. This doesn't affect the flavor of the water though. It seems to be wearing off gradually. I hope it does because we really like the kettle.
5,BEST LITTLE KETTLE,I don't know about a chemical odor. I have ordered 5 of these for myself and my daughters and none of them have had a chemical smell. I guess I lucked out. I highly recommend this little kettle; it boils water faster than anything and is quiet.
4,Capresso 259.03. H20 Plus Glass Water Kettle,I really like it but the lid is polished chrome and it is glued on and the steam made it come off. Now it does not look good with the black lid that is under the chrome. It would be nice if you would put a stainless steel lid and handle on the pot for that price.
1,tea water tastes like toxic waste,"I decided to buy a glass teapot because I wanted to stop drinking out of heated-up plastic. I read the reviews about a funny smell and taste in some people's, but not everyones, then read someone's who has a keen sense of smell and said it was fine, it's only the lid that smells bad. My experience-- the element inside is what makes it taste and smell nasty-- I would only have water in there long enough to heat up, and it would ruin it every time! I used it for a couple weeks, hoping it would go away, but it didn't, so I returned it. Boo."
3,Good for one year,"We received our Capresso Plus Glass as a gift from someone who had set our previous electric kettle on the stove (oops!). It is undeniably beautiful, as these things go, and worked quite well at first. It was also very easy to clean (soak in vinegar & water for a couple of hours). After a year, however, it began to fail to reach boiling, thus also failing to trigger the shut-off switch. It would simmer and rest, simmer and rest, indefinitely. I would imagine that this might be a fire hazard, were it to become empty. I regret that it did not last longer. I really liked it."
1,Deadly,The smell and taste are horrible...this has to be deadly...consuming boiled silicone? I called their customer service and they said to use the lemon water...this is junk...i purchased from teavana and can't take back..i'm really upset!!!
1,Didn't last,"This water kettle looks good, but it stopped bringing water to a complete boil after about a year of standard use.Six months later, the glass cracked while it was heating water up.Disappointed. If I were you, I'd go with a different kettle."
5,Perfection,Love this kettle...I hesitated with all the complaints about odors...but I bought it from a gourmet food shop where the owner assured me that none had ever been returned. It boils a full pot in about 6 minutes. No regrets...we really like this.
4,Excellent while it lasted,"This is a sharp looking efficient kettle. We had our for about six months before it stopped working. You may think that sounds bad, but we literally operate our kettle about 5-10 times per day. So it underwent a great deal of use, and I think I got my money's worth. I think I'll still try a different kettle this time around though. The major downer of this kettle for me was the size. We had to refill it quite a lot. :)"
2,"looks good, smells bad","I was so happy with this kettle, it looks good, the handle is great, I like how it has bumpers under, so you can remove it, and set it down softly anywhere. But there is that chemical smell, I thought it would go away after a few uses, but now I've been using it every day for 2 or 3 weeks, and the smell is still there, I feel like I'm drinking some plastic emissions....There is a plastic gasket in the bottom, between the metal and the glass, and the lid inside is plastic. Be aware of this. I bought the glass kettle as I thought it would be all glass.... can't really recommend this..."
1,Capresso Lost a Sale,"I just want to let Capresso know they lost a sale because of the reviews about the odor. It was between them and the Aroma AWK-115S Hot H20 X-Press 1-1/2-Liter Cordless Water Kettle. I like the looks of the Capresso better, but I don't want the odor in my coffee. So, I'm going with the Aroma AWK-115S."
2,doesn't last,"I bought this kettle TWICE because I like the appearance and the comfort of the handle (unlike the big bulky Hamilton Beach I can hardly get my hand around). Both times it stopped working a few days after the warrantee expired. It sometimes didn't turn itself off. It has to be half full (cover the metal heating ball) to work at all. For the price, it's a disappointment."
2,Shorted out after a year and a half,"I really enjoyed this kettle - it's beautiful and functional. However, mine just shorted out (big sparks flashing inside the kettle) - kind of cool, but very disappointing after only a year and a half of use. And I have to say that I too have been troubled by the chemical smell, and can't bring myself to re-order."
3,Work horse but lid broke early in the race,"I got this as a Christmas gift in December 2008. Just this morning (Happy Easter!) it finally stopped working. Tried different plugs in the kitchen but it's dead Jim! I used this kettle at least 3 times each and every morning for over 3 years. It really worked well, heated the water quickly. It claims to do this quietly but mine would drown out the tv in the mornings.The main drawback to this kettle was the lid broke early on, about a year after purchase. While that may not seem huge, the lid needs to be in place just so for the auto shutoff to work properly. And.....who wants to tinker with a lid in the early AM while just waking up?I'm on the fence if I'd purchase another."
4,Nice teapot,"I like this kettle, it looks nice and works fast.I put 4 stars because of a bad design of the bottom of the kettle - it has pockets that can get filled with water when you fill the teapot (if any waters gets on the outer side of it), and then this water gets out when you tilt it to pour the water from the teapot. Not a good design."
5,Almost two years old and still going strong,"Have had this kettle for 1 yr 11 months and it is still going strong. We use it at least once a day, normally 2 or three times a day. The only problem we have had is the plastic ""polished chrome"" top came off the lid and had to glue it back on. In addition, the top doesn't look very polished anymore, more like a piece of silver plastic with water stains. I like that this kettle is fast, clear, simple/minimal in design, and the minimum amount of water you need is two cups. Also, it is just too cool to watch. Finally, we always use water from our reverse-osmosis filter system and have never had to worry about leaving water in it for a few days or any type of buildups."
2,Nice concept with a smell of plastic,"What a nice idea - a glass kettle, the one you can see through boiling. Nice design as well. Main problem is that the heating element is surrounded by a plastic ring, which produce quite a noticeable smell of plastic when boiling water. We used it for a weak hoping that the smell will go away, but it didn't. Many kettles has plastic parts, but this seems to be the only one where plastic directly contacts heating element, not just water. And of course, bad stuff goes from plastic to your water along with the smell, but this is only for those who are concerned about health. My point is that this smell just ruins taste of all kinds of tea.Also, two minor things- it takes about 2 times longer to boil that other comparable kettles (still fast, actually)- nice an stylish blue light, which indicates that the kettle is on is not as visible as in other models."
2,Stopped Working,"We got one of the more recent kettles, so we had not noticed any odd smell or taste to the water. It had been working fine for the first 6 months, but it suddenly stopped working all together."
1,don't buy this!!!,"Looks can be deceiving as they say. This is a beautiful looking water kettle and for that reason I bought it. However, like others have said, there is a horrible chemical smell and taste when you boil the water. Even after I add sugar and milk in my tea, you can still taste a chemical. Not a good thing to say the least. This company should correct the problem."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I purchased this kettle after a recommendation from an associate. It is beautiful, heats quickly, and I had no trouble with a smell. However, after a year of use, the top fell off. I had taken care with this appliance but the plastic that holds the top just broke. I sent an email to customer service with no response at all. I didn't expect a new appliance but at least an acknowledgement of poor design. This is also a safety issue that could cause a bad burn. I will never buy one of their products again. A manufacturer should stand behind their product and Capresso certainly did not.C.Ely"
4,model ship building,Great book for the first time model ship builder. Full for great tips and short cuts. It's worth the money just for the time you will save and the mistakes you would have made.
2,Not very much information ...,"I looked carefully at the ""Look Inside"" review. Fully 26 out of 162 pages of this short book, or almost 1/6th of the entire book, is an italian-english translation dictionary. The book also has other fillers, like a half-page illustration of a desk with a ship hull laid on top. I do not think that a book of this length (and breadth, from reading all the ""Look Inside!"" pages) should be rated so highly."
3,A disappointing debut album,"I don't get it! This CD was so weak, and I think it damaged my player. It's not like I am old, but the stuff kids listen to these days is beyond me. Even if I got free tickets, I would not go to see Freud LU74R012 12-Inch 96-Tooth ATB Thin Kerf Cut-Off Saw Blade with 1- inch Arbor and PermaShield Coating in concert. Well, the third track was kind of catchy...I could dance to it."
3,COLLECTOR'S ITEM,"The movie is dumb and acting is grade C. The car chases are spectacular considering has no digital effects; but even so the 40 minutes chase is overlong.In any case, if you collect movies is a must."
1,Waste of time and money,"This DVD was a COMPLETE waste of time and money! It was a home made camcorder dvd of the singer and a friend. They offered no techniques for the gospel genre or even basic singing techniques for a novice. The singer even said if you want to learn how to sing gospel, get a cd of your favorite gospel singer and imitate them! What?! I wished I'd have litened to the other reviewer before I purchased this dvd. And the icing on the cake was that the copy of the dvd I got stopped at lesson 4! The rest of the lessons didn't play at all because of some glitch in its dubbing! Don't even bother with this one."
5,Very Good Phone and Answering machine,"Very easy to install, very easy to use, and it has a very useful feature thath allows you to check you voice messages from anywhere, you just have to call to your number and enter the password and you can hear and manage the voice messages... very nice telephone"
1,LC,"I just finished it. Left me very unsatisfied. The kind of book you want to throw across the room when you've finished reading it. It didn't have an ending. (You really are tricked into buying the next one, which is exactly what I'm not going to do).Can someone please recommend a good book, romantic but not too cheezy. I'm in need of a good book! I haven't read a good one in years now. One of my favorite author's was LaVyrle Spencer. Since her retirement it's hard to find a good book."
2,Disturbing reading,"I always enjoy Ms. Rice's books but this one disturbed me. I don't think it was necessary for her character to disappear like that. If she wanted to leave her husband she could have left a note that she felt endangered and was disappearing, some kind of note to keep the police from wasting years of manpower looking for her. She would have been just as safe, maybe even safer without her picture being all over the news and papers.It was no small thing to me that the detective, Patrick, had his marriage ruined because of his obsession with Mara's disappearance. All that could have been avoided, but it seems Mara didn't care what the fate was of those left behind, just as long as she and her baby were safe.It rather ruined the book for me."
5,McKenzie Airback review,Very compact and transportable but still works effectively to provide back support. Great for air travel or car travel. Recommend for those on the road frequently.
3,"stores small, provides small support","They could have sent this in an envelope, it stores almost flat... which could be a good thing for travel. It doesn't blow up very big. I prefer the thermarest self inflating items, but they do take up considerably more space. This will go into the theater much more inconspicously and still suffice... if it holds up and it looks pretty strong. I'm keeping it."
3,"Works good ,butgray spots!","It works perfect! So sticky. Nice! But if you're a bit clumsy like me.you can get gray spots on your yes and it spoils the whole make up,be careful when you are applying it ,and them you will get nice results !"
5,Great choice for VIXIA HF S21,"I went through many lenses for the VIXIA HF S21, including those recommended by Canon (the WD-H58 for example). This is a great choice if you don't want the heavy WD-H58 but still want 0.7x demagnification. Fits on the camera perfectly, and the full zoom range is available with no vignetting. Best of all, weight and cost is significantly less than the WD-58!"
4,Love it,This is a BIG book not pocket size people. BIG and very informative. nice instructive pics to follow. happy whipping!
4,"Good book, leading to hours of enjoyment","The book arrived quickly, and has led to many hours of knot tying. A great book to have as a Boatswain Mate in the US Navy."
1,"Should be 'The History of Nautical Knots""","Ordered this book on the recommendation of another site. If you are interested in learning knots, keep looking. The author gives great dialogue on the different knots and rope-work, just very weak on the instructional aspect. Selling my copy."
1,DO NOT BUY IT!,"WARNING! If you use it to store your camera (what else are you supposed to do?), it will corrode the metal casing and leave you with black spots. These are permanent. These spots began developing after a few months on my Canon camera. They acknowledge this problem and will ""fix"" your camera, whatever that means. Apparently they will do something that will mess up the casing even more and make it a darker color. Also, Canon claims that they do not manufacture the leather case, and therefore are not liable for this defective merchandise. According to Amazon, it is made by Canon. I bought it, and it was a waste of money."
4,Its easier to use than the hard case.,"I bought it to use with my sd400. I have the hard case for my wife's sd200, but I like this case better because you can get the camera out quicker for those fleeting-moment shots.Best would be a case you don't have to take off the camera and would protect it during use - like the old 35mm SLR's cases - except with a belt clip."
4,Why extra?,"Nice Case, fine because it's small.BUT - with as much as you pay for this camera, why can't they include a simple case? I would have paid ...more dollars at the outset for the case to be included, so I didn't have to spend the extra time looking to buy it, finding it, and paying to have it shipped to me!"
4,Canon case is a cover,"This is a great cover for the camera to protect the camera casing. It is not a camera bag or storage case for disks, instructions, lenses, or cleaning kit. It should be included with the camera as it really just covers the metal casing. For the price it Canon should add it to the set."
3,not a perfect case,"I like the fact that it fits my S400 like a glove, I dont need any additional space. I can always carry extra memory cards or batteries in a kit bag, no big deal.But I am totally totally surprised, why none of the reviewers point out that the loop design in this case is flawed. It is very irritating when once i finish taking a picture, i have to loop the entire thread back through the case hole on the top. This case does not get my vote."
5,Affordable complete 6 pole trailer conenctor kit,"Has everything you need for hooking up a 6 pole trailer connector.You'll need some technical expertise, but it's no rocket science."
3,Very Difficult,"The book presentation is very good but the presentation of the material 'jumps right in there' with a good review and is very technical and a bit difficult to follow. It is an excellent book for someone that remembers their basic math, if your rusty, take a refresher course first."
5,A Must Have...,"This is Certainly a ""Gotta Have It"" Figure from the Early Days of Marvel Legends. An Amazing Sculpt on the Most Iconic of All of Cap's Costumes, with a Great Base that Put Him Right into the Action of a Possible WWII Battle. Hangs on the Wall or Placed On a Shelf, I've Used it for Many Figures Over the Years, but Captain America is the Only One Who ""Flies the Flag"". Not an Overly Patriotic Person Myself, but I had a Captain America Figure Growing Up. He was a Bit Taller than a GI Joe (from the Secret Wars Series, I would Later Find Out), So He would Naturally Boss the Joes around and Be a ""Super-Soldier"". Purchasing this Figure was Based on that Nostalgia, and I'm So Glad I Did. Posing Him can Be a Little Tricky without the Base, but with it You Can Create some Dynamic Scenes. He Can Even Wear His Shield Over His Back like He does in Many of the Comics. That's Probably My Favorite Feature of this Amazing Figure."
1,Eh? How's That?,"This phone was a total disappointment, as it is impossible to hear the caller. If the volume is at its highest, your own voice is so loud that it's torture, and you still can't hear the other person clearly. I bought this phone because of previous good experience with a GE phone. Thought this would be better, since it's more powerful, but it's far worse."
5,"MEMORIES, MEMORIES, MEMORIES!!!!!!!","Always GREAT MEMORIES of this show. Yes they are syndicated versions but they still did a really Nice Job with all 4 Season Sets. Sit back , put your feet up and get ready for some good laughs with ALF!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Alf,Love this show. Wish TV today was more like it. Takes you back to when TV was worth watching. Love it!
4,campy fun,"This series was a favorite for my family back in the eighties, and we still enjoy it today. The first two seasons were our favorites but the last two were still great fun."
5,Excellent For the Novice or the Interested,"I bought this book in the late 1960's and have read it over and over for myself and others. Mr. Goodavage makes it easy to learn about your horoscope - far easier than any other book I have read, which were enough. Now in 2011 I can say that reading back upon the book, much of what he said has come to pass. I'm glad I did pay attention to help develop my better qualities while working on my not so positive traits. I'm re-reading it to have insights into my new grandchild. Highly recommend this book! Mine is falling apart. Must be time for a newer version."
4,Uncompromising,"The Brothers Chevelle have made, in my humble opinion, their finest album thus far in This Type of Thinking(Could Do Us In). It is, in short, unrelenting and uncompromising rock...not some superficial catchy bubblegum pop. Chevelle brings a high adrenaline, angst-filled, guitar-driven sound that is as unique to the music scene as anything out there.Of course, everyone digs Vitamin R, but few have heard the other solid tracks on the CD that are just as good, if not better. The most solid tracks include The Clincher, Get Some, Still Running, Another Know It All, To Return, and the slower, anthemic, but just as solid, Bend The Bracket. In summation, what you get with Chevelle is solid, unrelenting rock that, unlike pop, doesn't fizzle or go flat."
5,Perfect Third Effort,"These guys keep getting better. I wasn't much of a fan of their first release and their second was eh, good for the first month then found it's death somewhere in my car. But this, this is a good album. I have been waiting for a decent new cd to come out for a long time and this is the one. They do a great job of mixing up their sound from song to song and the entire album is sonically different than the past two. Vocals are impressive. Definitely more so than their past album and the guitar riffs are amazing. I'm impressed. If you've read this far you should at least check this album out. Listen to the songs and see if you don't agree!!"
1,Might as Well be a Single!,"i give Chevelle's new album ""This Kind of Thinking Could do Us In"" a 1 for the 1 good song on it...""Vitamin R"". Buy the single before you make a mistake of buying this album, cause the other tracks on this cd are junk...a 1 out of 5, TERRIBLE!!!"
2,Just wasn't good,"Having bought this book based on the review above, i wanted to like this book but it was in no way a page turner. I forced myself to read it and found most of it vapid and inconsequential. There really is no plot so much as conveyances of saratoga scenery from one sex scene to another. I found myself skipping entire chapters and not being lost in the ""plot"" because of it which says to me that much of the writing was just filler. Many of the characters actions and reactions to different situations just didn't ring true and then of a sudden the book just kind of ends. It sounds like i'm being uncommonly harsh but having just finished two historical page turners in a row my disappointment with this book grows. I only give it the second star because i actually finished it."
2,great idea - but not in aluminum!,"We love the idea of this popper, and used it at least once a week for a year. It worked great, but when it developed a pinhole in the bottom, right in the center, and oil started to seep out onto the hot burner, we got weary. And then when it started a small fire on the burner, we threw it out. We'll be replacing it with a stainless steel model (which means it will have to be a different brand)."
4,WhirleyPopper,"pops corn fast and with little clean up, product does feel a little light duty in regards to the price, but overall, satisfied"
5,Best tasting stuff you can pop,I think this is the best popper ever made. I just use peanut oil and a about 6 tablespoons of popcorn w/ some artificial butter salt and great corn arrives!! I have never burned any corn and the pot cleans up very nicely.
3,Crispy kettle corn but gears broke first time we used,"A friend made the best kettle corn and said she used a stovetop popper. She recommended getting one with metal gears but our little local kitchen store ordered the Whirley-Pop with plastic gears. Since the popper had a 25 year warranty, I bought it anyway. Unfortunately, mine broke the first use. The instructions said to stop turning when it gets hard to turn but I didn't think it was turning too terribly hard. The gears slipped about 10 times, so I stopped even though it was still popping. When looking at the gears, I saw one of the teeth had broken. The company was closed when I called, but hopefully it can be fixed easily! The kettle corn turned out great and was very crispy, so will make again but will definitely stop turning the first time the gears slip."
3,"Great product, but quickly falls apart!",I loved my whirley-pop and the popcorn that I received from Wabash Valley. The only problem is that once the handle turn breaks there is no other option but to throw the device away. I was very sad when it broke after 3 months of use.It is an exciting way to popcorn.
5,This Popper works well.,"At first glance, this Popper seems flimsy; made of thin aluminum. But the aluminum makes the kettle heat up very quickly. The rotating bar inside distributes the heat and keeps anything from burning. Very easy to clean, just wipe it with a paper towel.just don't try to overload it - a half a cup of kernels is maximum."
2,Whirly Pop could be so much better,"We received a Whirley Pop as a Christmas gift, and love it, but the construction is very cheap. As a previous reviewer wrote - because the pot is so thin, it deforms after some use. This item would get a 4 if the pot were made of better materials - 5 if the lid would clip on and off a bit easier. A shame since the popcorn is so good!"
5,Great,I got this for my mom who has ruined many regular pots making her popcorn. I was kind of skeptical about it but it turned out to be great. Yes the metal is really thin but as others have mentioned I believe that adds to its great functionality. You only need a tiny bit of oil and it pops so fast. Plus the popcorn puffs up bigger than making it in a regular pot and shaking it like mom used to do. I bought it several months ago and she still uses it several times a week. No gear problems at all as others have reported.
3,It's not THAT great!,"After reading all these wonderful reviews about this popcorn maker, I bought one myself. It's not a bad popcorn maker, but it is Cheaply Made! I burnt the bottom of the pan right off the bat while ""seasoning"" the popper. You have to re-season the thing after every washing! I kinda like my air-popper better, at least I'm not Required to use oil then!I agree with some of the other reviewers that there are quite a few ""biased"" reviews here...perhaps they are employees of Whirley Pop. I don't know, but don't believe everything you read about this popper. It's not all that and a bag of...corn!"
5,This is the way popcorn is supposed to taste!,This is very easy to use. Follow directions and taste the results and you will agree that you forgot what popcorn tastes like. I have been using hot-air poppers (tasteless popcorn) and microwaveable popcorn ( tastes artificial) for years. I knew something was wrong and couldn't figure out what until I purchased this product. WOW! Wake up and taste the popcorn. You use less oil than the other methods and the taste is 20 times better. I have bought one for each family member and they in turn are now buying for other friends and relatives.
4,Old fashioned popper,"This makes great tasting popcorn and uses very little oil so is healthier than microwave for sure. The metal is pretty thin, especially the lid so it has to be handled carefully. I've learned you must follow the portion directions exactly or you will end up with burned popcorn or a mess of oil on the lid. Be sure to send in the warranty card because it is a pretty flimsy popper!"
2,pops corn... but quality is lacking,"i've owned several whirley-pops in the past and for 2009 christmas i bought one for all my family because whirley pop made great popcorn. unfortuanately, whirley pop has gone to the plastic gear and aluminum pot.aluminum pot is ok, but if your a cook like me.. nothing works like stainless.plastic gear.... i bought 12 of these for my family members and had 2 extra... i went through both of them in about 3 weeks due to the plastic gear breaking teeth off.go for the back to basics popcorn popper... metal gear... lid is a little tricky... but it makes great popcorn, has a stainless pot... and doesn't break."
5,Whirley Pop - if only it could last forever...,"BEST BEST BEST popper you will find. Nearly every kernel pops, and none of them burn. A giant batch comes from just a 1/4 cup of kernels, and it takes just 3 minutes to pop. The only thing that I would wish for is that they make the Whirley-Pop last forever.Some may say the gears are lightweight and prone to breaking. If you crank the handle gently and stop when the popcorn provides a little resistance, you'll make the popper last a long time. It's not for handling rough. Stirring really fast won't speed up the brief 3-minute process - so just relax, crank slowly as if you DON'T want to break it, and enjoy the fruits of your labor. :-)But hey - it's so GOOD that if you needed a new one once a year, you won't be wasting your money. You'll never buy those smelly bagged microwave things again.Now, stop reading reviews, and order your Whirley Pop!!"
3,Not as good as the original,"The only reason that I am giving the Whirley pop a three star rating is because I feel the construction quality of the machine is just not up to par. The hinges that keep the lid on kept wanting to slip off. I have only used it a few times and the base is already dented, how? I have no idea I haven't hit it on anything.The popcorn comes out great, every kernal popped to perfection. I can't wait until I try some of the recipes."
1,popcorn popper,"Worked OK for about a week, then the whirly thing broke away from the bottom of the pot. It still works but not as well. Very cheap construction."
4,Good Popper,"I don't like that the gears are plastic, but I am guessing it is so they don't rust. We have used 4 times in the week since we got it and have had no burned corn and no kernels left. It is great and so far we LOVE it!!! Very easy to clean. I use canola oil and Orville Reddenbacher popcorn and it is perfect everytime. Med 5-6 heat on a gas stove. It's a keeper!"
5,Good Eatin'!,"I love this popper!! It is a fun and easy way to have a healthy and delicious snack. I purchased it two years ago and have eaten microwave popcorn only ONCE since then. Yuck! Once you prepare your popcorn with the Whirley-Popper, you will not want another bag of nuked popcorn ever again."
3,Whirley-pop popcorn popper,"Found same product at Target for $21.95. Product is not the best to use on a Flattop range, this is not noted in the add."
1,Something is wrong here,"I agree with a previous review---something about the accolades is biased here (consider the repeating phrases).This does not produce great popcorn. I bought the unit with the special Wabash popcorn pouches touted to have won awards. I have used several, and the popcorn is not crisp, but is chewy, not particularly special in flavor, and full of saturated fat because of the coconut oil blend in the pouches.The unit is flimsy, prone to bending, and IMO does not produce popcorn as good as Popsecret Homestyle or Orville's Movie Theater microwave popcorn.Avoid this item! Within weeks I had to dispose of it."
4,popcorn without the microwave,This is a great product. It has held up well. It allows you to make the kind of corn you want.
4,Great Product,Works great! Only complaint is that it makes a loud squeaky sound when i turn the handle. Nithing a little oil cant fix.
2,Gears are the weak point,"As other reviewers have said, this popper makes good popcorn until the plastic gears start to slip. Our popper has been gently used but within a few months of getting it the plastic gear got loose on the shaft. In the middle of a batch it would slip and the cranking mechanism would become unusable, leading to a ruined batch. Reassembling the gear mechanism is a pain and the fix doesn't last. When it works it makes wonderful popcorn, but they need to reengineer the gear mechanism to make it last as long as the other parts. I hope they solve the problem. I wouldn't buy another until they do."
3,Lightly Built,"A good idea, just cheaply made with very thin aluminum. The gears are plastic and I'm suspicious of long term durability. I've been using it to roast green coffee beans, and it does a great job. The concept is excellent, and works well, just too bad that manufacturing and execution are so cheap.R*2"
4,No grannies,"I love my Whirley-Pop popper for the most part. It makes the best popcorn of any popper I've ever used with virtually no grannies (unpopped kernels).I use a 1/3 cup of popcorn, 3 Tablespoons butter-y popcorn oil and a teaspoon of sea salt in mine to make popcorn perfectly to my tastes, a bit more salt and oil makes a popcorn my husband loves.I use it on a gas range with no issues.My only complaints about it are that the brushed aluminum and top are very hard to get very clean by handwashing. I wind up having to use a chopstick and a bit of steel wool to get into the housing that has the gear to turn it and brushed aluminum has to be scoured to get all traces of oil out of it or it will feel sticky to the touch after it dries.So far, it's worth the effort. Popcorn made this way does taste a lot better to me than airpopped."
4,Whirley pop stovetop popcorn popper,"I've always wanted one of these but they seemed over-priced in the stores.i saw in on Amazon.com at a very good price. its really great.almost every kernel pops.its very fast, it makes a good amount and its guaranteed for 25 years when you register it. the only drawback is the lid has very sharp edges, you can easily get cut which means children should not use it. other than that i love it and use it all the time, real popcorn is way better than that air-popped stuff!"
5,YOU WON'T BE SORRY,"I had seen pictures of this device for years, but thought it was an older design and was no longer available. I can't tell you how much I LOVE this thing. I have long been crazy about popcorn, prefering the oil-method electric poppers rather than the ones using air (the sale doesn't stick to air-popped corn). After the failure of my electric model, I bought this popper and have been happily using it since. Easy to use and clean (wipe clean with a paper towel) and it uses very little oil, making the popcorn healthy as well. It actually does work as fast as they claim, less than 3 minutes from turning on the burner to bowl. This is the world's best popcorn popper."
5,Perfect!,"This popper works great. As long as you sit there and spin the handle continuously, you will get a full pop. Its usual for me to have less than 5 or 6 unpopped kernels. Get this!!!"
2,Received wrong kind of popcorn,"Purchased this as a gift for a family that loves Kettle Korn. There was a delay in delivery, which eventually made it in time for the holidays. But when the family opened it, there was no Kettle Korn, only regular popcorn. Tried to get Kettle Korn packets from the company, but to no avail."
2,popcorn pan,This popper is made very cheaply. Gears fall apart easily and the popcorn gets jammed in the pan easily. Turning mechanism is very weak. Works best if small batches are made.
3,Disappointed,"I was primarily disappointed with the lack of rigor. But it has more pretty pictures than math textbooks I remember from high school, in case you need that sort of thing to keep your (or your students') interest. I would rather have paid less for a black-and-white text that doesn't hurt your arms to hold up to read (the dimensions of the book also make that awkward). There are nice little blurbs about various relevant/famous mathemeticians. The book strives to give a lot of real-world examples, and for that I give it 3 stars instead of 2. If you are looking for a book with that kind of emphasis, you may find this to be just what you want. I have to agree with an earlier reviewer that my highschool trig and precalc course were much more detailed and had more depth.PS: I am still searching for an errata sheet."
1,"Not really a review, but a caution","There isn't enough info for this item and it's really my fault that I didn't do enough research on this item, but recommendation information for this lens adapter might suggest that it can be used with the G3. It's absolutely wrong -- the right lens adapter is LA-DC58B. The appended ""B"" is important! Be sure that if you're buying the G3 or G5 and need the adapter that you get that one instead.As such, I'm sure this lens adapter works fine on the G1 and G2, but I can't be totally sure of this, having not used it."
2,Answering Machine Got Fried in Power Outage,"After using it for over a little two years, it got fried in a power outage. The message display says ""8"" and none of the buttons responded. The manual said to unplug power cord and plug it back it. Nothing.This was purchased for the home office. For the main home number, the answering machine combined with a phone by AT&T; survived the power outage."
2,Alien attempt,"This is an old movie from 1984 and to me seems like a cheap attempt to reproduce the ""ALIEN"" sci-fi movie. It has the same premise ole dead ALIEN on an ancient world that all it wants is to kill. It does not make it! Save your money..."
3,A book for Dads..,"I enjoyed the letters in the beginning of the book but by mid-book I felt like it was enough of the same thing. It might make a good gift for your father or someone who is a new father but I, personally, didn't feel the necessity of finishing the book. Perhaps if I'd have read Mr. Russert's first book, I would have enjoyed this more."
4,a great father's day gift,I gave this to my Dad for Father's Day while he was in the hospital recovering from heart bypass surgery. It is a great book to pick up and read a story or two at a time.
2,Liberal Bias,This paper's hard left swing in recent years has left it irrelevant to the broader values of the communuties that it once served
5,Excellent Book for the Beginner,"I bought this book simply to broaden my knowledge on IT security. Although I have worked in the IT field for years, my area of expertise is not security. The book offers a nice overview of the hacking methdology from footprinting to actually hacking into a network. It is a perfect book to get started in the area of IT security."
4,Good for a travel razor,"I purchased this razor to use while traveling. It is light weight, cordless, and uses Li batteries with a long charge. Sure, it doesn't give as clean and quick a shave as my everyday razor, but it is great for what it is . . . a travel razor."
4,Good Razor,"I like this razor a lot. It cuts pretty well, nice and tight the way I like it. The fact that it's water proof means you can shave in the shower to get an even closer shave. It also makes cleaning a cinch. Also, the battery life on this baby is awesome. Although I am Asian and I don't have a full beard to content with. I do shave a every morning and ever since I got it 2.5 years ago, I'm still on the same set of lithium batteries."
1,Expensive Toy,"I've tried this razor for 5 weeks, both wet and dry and can only say that this is the worst electric razor that I've ever used. It doesn't give a close shave and requires a second shave with a standard razor to remove some of the stubble. I shouldhave bought a new Norelco instead of this. My old Norelco alwaysshaved me close. This Panasonic would still be handy as a travel razor, or to be used in a pinch. But for a close shaving everyday razor, this isn't the one to buy.Oh well, I waited too long to send it back."
3,gets the job done,"Good for small to average sized necks, comfortable enough to wear to bed if needed, gets the job done for temporary support such as a strained muscle, or minor injury to neck shoulder area. The Velcro. Area could be a little sturdier."
4,RADICAL HAIR BARBIE,My daughter Alex is a Barbie fanatic. She loves all kinds of Barbies and accessories to go with them. Barbies are durable and they last forever! I don't think Alex can get enough of them!
2,poor,"Not real, not good acting. The story line was very poor. I did not like the way it switched from 2 women and then 2 women."
5,perfect fit..good price,The filter fit my 2009 Ford Escape XLT FWD perfect with no issues and it was much cheaper to buy from here. Installation (and I am no mechanic by ANY means) took about 5 minutes..SUPER easy.
3,"Works, but does not include everything advertised","Recently installed my Kicker ZX750.1 Amp with this wiring kit, it does not, as it claims, include the Split Loom Tubing. It does, however, include everything in the Amazon picture. The gauge seems to be pretty accurate, the kit doesn't measure the wire gauge based on a pound of insulation, as some cheaper kits like to do. If you do order this kit, realize that you will probably also need some speaker wire, and speaker RCAs. Other than that, this kit seems to work pretty well."
2,not a real fireplace,"This was a gas fireplace with fake logs. The logs never burn down like a real fireplace. Plus, I expected a roaring fireplace, not this trickle. I don't know how they did it, but even the beach fire looked fake. No logs burned down and crumbled as a real fire would. When burnt logs burn, they crumble and emit lots of embers and sparks. This lacked all of that."
2,Loaded with errors,"I used this book (fourth edition) in a graduate level thermo course and found the errors so numerous that it was absolutely frustrating trying to make sense of an already difficult subject. The one good thing about the book is that Gaskell offers many worked examples (unfortunately the errors in the examples make many of them quite confusing).I find it ironic that the preface reads ""The fourth edition...is different from the third...[in that] there is an acute emphasis on typographical and mathematical accuracy."" If this is the case I would have hated to have used the third addition."
3,Could be worse... could be better,"This is not a good book. It's full of errors.Of course, the other thermo books out there (DeHoff, Lupis, Swalin) are much worse. At least Gaskell's explainations make a little sense.Read this book for the concepts; read another when you want accurate equations, graphs and tables."
5,Soon to be a Best Seller!,"The divide of east and west evaporates in the breadth of Ali-Salaam's ""Becoming Human; Being Human"". He see things as they are and knows what they can be and guides us on how we can get there. A world not divided by linguistic archetypes, religous dogma, but a world uplifted by the common understanding of the inalienable rights of all people. A must read, I anticipate this book to make it to the Best Seller's List!"
3,Hornblower in magic seas,"There are two different stories in this book, and for the reader, almost independent. The first is the coming of age of a young man, with a fast, furious pace who ends in a bloodbath, and the start of a new life. The second one, far better than its predecessor is in the line of Forrester, Pope, naval adventure intertwined with magic. Very interesting and convincing to follow the next installment."
4,Easy to add floppy capability,"Many of the newer laptops don't come with floppy drives. Supporting users who require floppy use but have no floppy drive can be difficult. Memorex's 3.5 external USB floppy drive is easy to use, at an affordable price. No software needed (at least not for the latest Windows OS and Mac OS systems.) It was immediately recognized by the system, and useable. (Insert USB cable into system, insert floppy into drive, browseable floppy!)This product is especially good in that it means multiple people can share the drive as needed rather than wasting space and weight lugging around a laptop with the added feature."
1,Suzuki FL-SC Flute,"As a band teacher and technician I can say without reservation that this flute was not ready to be sold.The case and the box and the literature are the best money can buy but the flute willmake it impossible for a young student (any student)to progress.In short- It does not work- The right hand keys are set incorrectly and the instrument leaks. It would require an hour for a technician to adjust it correctly.More time must be invested into quality control-AS difficult as it is for an experienced player to use this instrument, it would be impossibke for a student to learn on it."
3,Never paraphrase ancient texts...,"A good book overall, but I feel authors should never paraphrase ancient texts; it takes from credibility. It's difficult to believe a Ph.D. wrote this. I expected a lot more."
2,"Great Coasters, BAD Video","First of all, this video runs in SLP mode. The picture quality is poor. The sound is ok in stereo. The 3d effect works ok. On the good side, you get to see coasters from all over. This is 1998 so you don't get the newest ones, but you do get some unique rides. It was worth the $10 at the video store. Some nit-picks: I want to hear the COASTER, not the music. I want to see the entire lift hill, not just the beginning and at the peak. I want to hear the ""click-click""."
4,Fun third-person shooter!,"Yes, the original Xbox is on the way out. Yes, there are better shooters out there. Yes, the game is kinda short. But this game is really fun! I almost didn't play the game because of the snobby reviews that say there's nothing new here. Yeah, if you're comparing it to Gears of War! I was able to immerse myself in a fantasy world for a few days and had a blast doing it. Rogue Trooper controls are good and is definitely better than a lot of the shooters to come out on Xbox. Any shooter fan is missing out on a fun ride. Pick it up cheap. You won't regret it."
5,Great,It is one of the few games that reinspires the shooter genre. It is deep and innovative and is definitely fun to play. The thing I love the most is hiding behind cover and throwing a grenade.
2,Beginners only!!!!,"Whilst Jam Master Jay is undoubtably a legend to hiphop fans, this DVD doesn`t really do his legacy much good. For an instructional video this video features very little instruction, and what instruction there is crosses between cd players and turntables, whereas most of us can`t afford both!!!! Instead of instruction you are treated to a lot of showcases performed by Jam Master, which show his awesome skills, but with no pointers on how to achieve that level of skill.If you know what a BPM is; can set up your DJ equipment properly; know the difference between a cheap belt-driven turntable and an expensive direct drive; and can perform basic scratching there is absolutely nothing else worth having on this DVD other than that. If what I`ve said makes no sense to you then this video could be perfect for you."
1,leak,I am sorry to say that I am not happy. The tether ball has a slow leak and will not keep air in it. I am planning on sending it back. The kids were very disappointed that the Easter Bunny brought something broke!!
2,"""1-cup"" equals two ounces!",It's really cute but it won't make a cup. It'll make at most two ounces. It's only like four inches tall. I was hoping to be able to make enough for two people to have a few ounces so I guess I'd need to buy the 3-cup.
2,Very Basic General Overview,"This book is okay as an introduction to how outboards work, but if you know anything about mechanics, I'd recommend you forego this and just buy a factory repair manual for your engine - as this book is frustrating in its lack of detail."
3,Excellent overview - but buy the service manual too,"This book provides a thorough explanation of the workings of 2-stroke & 4-stroke outboard engines, with conscientious troubleshooting guides & meticulous maintenance schedules. However, it works best as a companion to the service manual (not the general Owners Manual, but the Service Manual) for your specific model. Consider the number of outboard engine types and it's easy to see that diagrams and descriptions included are necessarily generic. If you're the kind of person who likes to know the theory behind the black box before fixing anything, order this & the manual. If you just want to learn how to clean your carburetor, call your manufacturer & get the manual."
2,Storm Cellars in Key West????,"This book was given to me by a friend and it was a fairly good read because of its Key West setting, but where were the editors and why didn't somebody check the book for accuracy before publication? I had a really hard time getting past the storm cellars (which are non-existant) in Key West and characters going underground (which is the LAST place you'd want to be) with a hurricane approaching. That being said, I'll probably give Merly Sawyer another chance and give ""Half Moon Bay"" a try."
3,Not one of her best,"I do feel that this novel was a tad more suspenseful than some of her others, but it did not have the emotional attachment as Tempting Fate or Half Moon Bay. I did notice though that this was the only one in the series that was labeled as a romantic suspense rather than a contemporary romance. I have a feeling the author was trying to expand yet did not do the best job. She tried to keep the suspense going throughout the book, and even tried shocking the reader with her surprise ending, but it was very anticlimactic as another reader mentioned. I have read books much worse, but do not believe that this particular novel is one of her best. It is just an okay read. Check it out from the library rather than buying it. That way you won't be too sorry that you spent the money."
2,Not as good as her previous work,I read this book after having read 'Nest of Vipers'. I was disappointed. The plot seemed to plod and did seem to be lost in some sort of Wilderness.
1,copycat,why did you use the same title that david c. martin did in his 1980 book? were you lazy or tired?
4,Cute and Sweet Book,"Kelly Atwood marriage starts out with knocking out her new husband cold, after finding drugs in her suitcase. So whats a girl to do, but run. She ends running to Paradise Washington and in to the arms of local golden boy Sam Grayson. Who, with the help of the town falls hard for Kelly.After reading the first book by Ms. Macpherson, I was looking forward to this book. It was a good, but the only thing that bug me was that the good people of Paradise, including our hero just seem to perfect to me. But still this is a good book for a rainy day or car trip."
2,Great start,"I really loved the beginning of this book and the heroine who knocks her criminal husband out. Kelly is eccentric, dyes her hair and has everything pierced. She meets and moves in with an even more eccentric woman and, all together, there was just TOO much eccentric in one place.I would have enjoyed the book a lot more without so much Myrtle."
2,Doesn't really tell you how to cook with a Dutch oven...,"I was disappointed in ""The Outdoor Dutch Oven Cookbook."" I purchased this book looking for information on cooking with Dutch ovens. What I got was a book with some interesting recipes (quite a few that are not made with a Dutch oven!) that was very vague about cooking techniques. There is a section on the differences in cast iron and aluminum Dutch ovens and some info on the various ways you can use them, but nothing on the actual techniques. After reading the book, I have the same questions I started with! Instead of the oddly random general camping information (""catch & release"" fishing, human waste disposal, etc.) I would've much preferred some nitty-gritty info on how to use a Dutch oven."
4,"Delicious, versatile recipes for home and camping.",We have used this cookbook at home using our conventional oven as well as in our backyard and on camping trips. The recipes are fairly easy and there is a a good variety to choose from. My kids have even tried some of the desserts and breads. The instructions are straight forward and simple.
2,Using dutch oven cookbooks,I found a couple of things in book I really liked but I have found a book that I like alot better.It is a book by Dian Thomas and it is called Backyard Roughing It Easy.
1,Don't Judge This Book By It's Title,"Even though this book is titled ""The Outdoor Dutch Oven Cookbook"", most of the recipes and cooking instruction are geared more towards cooking indoors in your kitchen. The cooking instructions always include the oven temp needed for a conventional oven but never tell how many charcoal briquettes are needed for your dutch oven. This ""Cookbook"" has more information in it about waste disposal, including human waste, than it does about how to use a dutch oven. This book is a recipe book that seemed to at ""Dutch Oven"" in the title as an afterthought."
1,skip this brand,"I had been a little concerned after reading the reviews of the Invicta brand watches. They didn't seem very dependable and I didn't read many good things about their customer service. But, many of the reviews were old and, hoping things had changed, I thought I'd give it a try after FedEx lost my St. Moritz. It looked the same but was junk. The first thing I did was unscrew the crown to set the date and time - and it wouldn't screw back down to make it watertight. I sent it back the next day and won't waste my time with an Invicta again. As a diver I have to have a waterproof watch that is rugged and dependable. It seems this brand doesn't make watches that are either."
1,There are far better resources,"I too, was recently forced to use this book for a University of Maryland course, and am still at a loss as to why it was ever selected as a university text. Everything from the section headings to the review questions are poorly organized and apparently not edited. Questions are often vaguely worded and there is no answer key against which to check your progress. The writing style changes throughout the text leading me to believe that this was a group effort without enough supervision. If you are a UM student, you don't have a choice but to use this text. However, if you want a real MSCE study guide, there is an ocean of better choices out there. Go fish!"
1,Boring Boring Boring,"To be honest this is the first Black Lesbian Series I've ever seen. I thought the video footage was terrible it gave me a migraine, The majority of the actors were beginners which they could not act at all. The story lines were ok but I would not waste my money with this one. There is a Season 2 maybe that one will be better than this one."
3,Looks Great After Application / Appearance Doesn't Last Long,"I have applied about 3-4 gallons of this product to my large outdoor tiled terraces/decking now twice; once per year. Enrich N Seal happens to have done a better job than other products I have experimented with in the past. Enrich N Seal does leave a new looking, shiny, lustful, wet look to the flooring. Unfortunately, my experience has been that it does not remain looking new for much longer than six months; it seams to wear off & in some areas even display a whitish appearance or film. One time, I did find this product (1 gallon size) on-line selling for 1/2 the retail price; hopefully, I can find it again on sale since the product does not go very far and is expensive. Be careful when walking on the finished job; my tile (in particular) initially has a very slick surface after wiping off the Enrich N Seal."
2,Not really for a beginner,"For me, this package isn't well constructed.Lets take lesson 1 for instance, the very first dialogue we are given is:Wang xiaojie, hao jiu bu jian! Ni hao!It then gives the whole conversation before giving the translation in English:Miss Wang, I haven't seen you in a long time. Hello!Ok, so how are we supposed to know what word means what when you consider that Mandarin word order is mostly not the same as English?It then gives 32 words showing how different tones have different meanings. In the first lesson! Are we supposed to remember this?I'm sticking to Pimsleur."
4,"Good, but a little expensive","This product workd just fine, but it is a little expensive. You could buy third-party products that work fine for much less. it is smaller than older models, and comes with the USB cord needed to use it."
5,Excellent,Dont't you dare to have an iPod without this charger!!!It's fast and DO FULL CHARGE the iPod.
3,Overpriced,"This adaptor works and I needed it, but $30.00 for a simple plug, with no cables, is way too much money!"
1,Not an Apple product!,This item is falsely advertised as an Apple product. It is NOT made by Apple. It is a cheaply made imitation. The pieces don't fit together quite right and the charging chord is not able to plug all the way into the charging block. When the charger is plugged in it emits a VERY loud VERY high pitched buzzing sound that my entire household finds unbearable. This charger is not worth your time or money!
2,Be careful who you order from!,"I ordered from Mac_Pro_Online and did not get the USB cable. It wasn't even a genuine Apple. I returned it for a refund (still waiting) and ordered the real thing directly from Apple. The genuine Apple charger is an updated model, so I can't comment on this one. Just be careful if you don't order from Amazon because outside sellers think it's okay to sell something other than what's described just by putting a ""comment"" (which can't even be seen if you order from the featured seller)."
3,"Worked great, then died","After about 3 months, the AC adapter just stopped working, leaving me in a pinch when it came to charging my ipod (I was traveling). While I can live without my ipod, it was still a hassel. Not sure what caused it, but it was working great beforehand. Perhaps this is not genuine Apple, or perhaps I just got a faulty one, but be aware that this may happen to you as well. While it lasted, however, it was a great small size and I've always liked the utility of Apple AC adapters. If you care about quality, make sure it is genuine Apple (though this is sometimes difficult to ascertain)."
3,"Charger OK?, Batteries not OK","The charger seems to charge the batteries as it is supposed to. It takes about 8 hours to fully charge four batteries. Once charged, the batteries work OK if uesd within a couple of days, although I thought I would get more pictures per charge than I do. The real problem is that after about 5 days after charging the battery, they are essentially dead. They will not even turn on the camera. It doesn't matter if they are stored in the camera or not. The voltage measured at that point is about 1.1 volts. I have had the unit about two months and this has been a problem from day one. I even tried a full discharge through the charger, but that made no difference. I don't know if I have defective batteries (all four) or if the charger is not providing a full charge even though the indicator shows it to be fully charged.I expected better from Sony than this."
1,Very Disappointed,I was hoping that the negative comments that I read were not true but I was not so lucky. I like the display of this charger and thats about it. The batteries NEVER get fully charged (I have a professional battery tester). The batteries that come with it don't fully charge and lose their charge in about a day without even being used. I would not recommend this charger to anyone. I would send it back in a heartbeat if it wouldn't cost me so much.
1,Simply doesn't work!!,I don't know if I bought a fake product. The charger never get a battery fully charged. I got the same bad experiences decribed by other customers.
1,Each charge does not last long,"After one week, I went out and purchased a Duracell rechargeable battery pack and I am much more pleased."
4,"Good charger, bad batteries, good service getting bad batteries replaced","This is a good AA and AAA charger. I've purchased two of these over the past year. The bundled 2700mAh AA batteries each time were defective - couldn't hold a charge more than a couple of days. I got good, free service from Sony in getting the defective batteries replaced with working 2500mAh ones.As for this item's 'lousy everything' rating: So if I give 'lousy everything' a 1 star rating if I don't agree (i.e. it's bad at being lousy at everything) but 5 stars if it is really good at being 'lousy at everything'? Doesn't the normal star rating for a product offer one's opinion on the overall 'lousy-ness' albeit in reverse fashion?"
4,Does everything I need and then some,"Bought this to replace a previous Sony charger that I lost. Works the same with a bit more features, especially like the lcd display which my old one did not have. Display is not an absolute must, but handy for giving me an idea of how much longer batteries need to recharge fully. However, not as convenient as it requires a AC cable, old one had a built in plug."
3,Interestin item but not so great,It is definitely a good lucking item. The LCD indicator are not so accurate. Takes long time to charge. It is not a super quick charger.May be a bit quicker than normal charges. But definitely not 15 mins charget. Takes more than 1 hr to charge well.
4,Decent product,Been using this for the past one month and so far no issues with it. Good one to go for..
4,"Overall good, would recommend to others..","THE GOOD: Sleek design, LCD Display (very easy to check how much the battries are charged), refresh Function (will drain batteries before recharging)The BAD: The batteries are untouchably hot after recharge. The power cord could be replaced by direct wall plugin unit. Plastic cover is bit flimsy."
1,useless,Total dissapointment. I had been using two other brands of chargers and the charge lasted up to 2 - 3 months on my keyboard and mouse. All I get out of batteries charged on this unit is a week! The power cord is also tricky to get it to plugged into the unit.
4,A very nice charger,"Overall a very nice charger, though recharge times aren't even close to what is advertised. The display is very nice as is the ability to charge individual batteries instead of having to do it in a pair. The 900 mAH hold such a small charge that they are almost worthless."
2,Charger OK .Batteries are CRAP,The four 2700mA batteries (Sony label) that came with this charger are TOTALLY WORTHLESS. They hold a charge for a few days and then are dead ... not weak ..DEAD. Sony should be replacing these free of charge to all who have them.
2,Batteries have poor standby time,"These batteries work great when freshly charged, but do not expect them to hold a charge over time. A couple of days in my camera bag and they will only be able to fire my flash once or twice."
2,Sony BCG-34HRMF4 Battery Charger with LCD Display and 4 AA Ni-MH Rechargeable Batteries,"The 4 batteries that came with the charger would not hold a charge more than a few short days. Contact Sony who replied, advised some more action with the batteries and said if that did not work they would replace them."
1,"Batteries TERRIBLE, Charger Solid","The batteries that come with this charger are terrible and self-discharge within 24 hours of being fully charged. I complained to amazon and they were nice enough to send me a replacement, but there was the same problem with the new batteries as well. I would avoid this product unless you only want the charger, and plan on buying batteries elsewhere."
1,Worst battery charger ever,"I've used various NiMH chargers for years, and this is probably the worst I've ever used. I keep it next to my computer to charge AA batteries for my bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and the batteries last approximately 1.5 days before they need another charge. If I put the exact same batteries into my $15 energizer charger I bought from walgreens, they last for weeks. This is regardless of whether I use the new Sony batteries that came with the device, or the energizers I get from walgreens.It's also very aggressive about reporting that batteries are past their usable lifetime. Some of the batteries I just got with the device are already dead after only a few charge cycles.Perhaps I got a dud, but I will stay away from sony chargers in the future."
1,Incompatible with Wiimote (Wii remote),"Yeah, I bought this for my Wiimote (Wii remote) but it doesn't work with it. I put in the same batteries in a remote control for a stereo system, and it works so it's not like I didn't charge the batteries properly."
3,"Not bad, but not great","Used these gloves on about 5 to 6 different occasions for CrossFit workouts: weightlifting, pull-up bars, dumbells, kettlebells, etc. By the 6th time I had used them, calluses and skin tears were developing on my hands and some of the ""pearls"" were coming off. The grip is good, not great, and I felt the 'easy tab' on the inner side of the middle finger didn't significantly help with getting them on or off.All in all I believe it's a good glove and does what it's supposed to for lightweight, low intensity bar/lifting use, but with higher intensity activities like CrossFit or for serious weightlifting, I would choose something a bit sturdier."
3,Little Piggy,My dogs just love this toy. The only thing that would improve it would it being more durable. I have purchased many of them because the dogs tear them up.
5,The best of suspense and romance.,As fast-paced as Grisham and much better at relationships. Kept me reading on and on. Can't wait for the next one.
4,One of our favorites!,"We bought this book when our daughter was a newborn and she's always loved it! Now that she's two, she still gets a kick out of reading it! However, I recommend that you not buy this item online because there's a mirror on the last page and some copies of the book have a blurry mirror! You're better off buying it in a store to make sure that the book isn't defective!"
2,"Not good, do not buy!","I tried to buy this game from one of the vendors here it never came, but then I found out a friend had one she let me have it, I now know why too, it is well boring, I hate these games that market it self as being like The Sims games, when they are NOTHING like them, if you like The Sims games, then forget it, this is not the same, its like Sims City in that you watch everything from above the people, but then it gets really boring really fast, I am so glad I didn't pay for this junk, Amazon gave me a refund on my order so I didn't wast my money, so don't wast yours its not worth it, sure if you like Zoo Tycoon or something like that you MIGHT like it, and I do stress MIGHT, I have Zoo Tycoon and even though it wasn't really for me, I definitely prefer it to The Movies,so that's all hope that helps someone, wish I had read the reviews!"
2,Not Sim-like enough; a little disappointing for the Sim fan,"I was under the impression that this game would have more Sim-like functions; there is little interaction between stars, no ability to personalize sets, and unimaginative costumes. The tutorial is absolutely terrible. As a fan of the Sims, the Sims 2 and SimCity, this game is not what I expected. If you prefer the character and building options with these other games, don't waste your money on this one. I wouldn't buy it knowing what I know now."
3,fun in the beginning but boring later,Ive played the sims and love it. The sims is my favorite. Id been wanting the movies for a long time. Okay so I find out it's 34.99 at best buy. I head over to best buy and pick it up along while doing some last minute christmas shopping. I get home and pop the discs in and install the game. The game runs great and is very playable. I start playing with the game thinking it's really fun. Fun for a little while and than.....Boring. It's very repitive and making movies becomes old after awhile. I tried making a movie that made sense but it didnt happen. I love the idea behind this game but it was not devolped far enough. Luckly I paid $35 instead of $50.This game will be down to a budget game at $14.99 in no time. Ill stick with my sims.
2,"Interesting premise, but poorly written and argued","The research and quotes used throughout this work seem well documented, and the premise seems sound...that James the VI and I was maligned due to the antagonism of court intriguers who were ousted as favorites with his reign, and who had strong prejudices against the ""uncivilized Scots"" Anyone with any experience of the literature and sensibilities of the times would recognize that the sentimentality and expressions of love that were purported to be the evidence of James' homosexuality were absolutely normal and common speech of the times. However, I object to the homophobic tone that the writer pursues, as if such accusations were the most evil thing one could say of another, and I find the organization and arguments to be rambling and excessively repetitious. The author could have used a strong editor with a red pencil. The theme could have been fully discussed in an article of magazine length, rather than a $15 book."
3,ex calc,"Calc seems good for the price, nothing too fancy. I just opened the spreadsheet that I used to track my finances and all the equations went hay wire and changed. I immediately reverted to excel. I do not know exactly why and do not wish to explore it further. I need a spreadsheet that will not fail."
1,"lots of opinion, too little fact","If you're curious to learn Joyce Milton's opinion of Hillary, Bill, and the Clinton white house, read this book. If you're looking for a more objective picture of Hillary Rodham Clinton and her ideas, look elsewhere."
2,WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER BOOK ON HILLARY.,"Joyce Milton is a fine writer and has written many good books. However, this time she has just written a book for sell and not informing the public. Hillary is tested every day by being in the public arena. The book just rehashes old stories into new revelations that cannot be confirmed. I expect better from Joyce and I shall read her again on another day...Joe Janos"
1,Hillary is a disappointment to remain with unfaithful Bill.,I admire independent women. Hillary is not one who I want to represent me.
4,"Renaissance - Sometimes Overlooked, But A Great Album","This is an interesting album for me. Most Renaissance fans don't rank this one up with what are considered the classics from the band, but I really enjoy this one and rank it higher than albums like ""Turn Of The Cards"" or ""Prologue"". I don't really think there is a weak track on this one. It might be slightly more mainstream sounding than some of their earlier material, but they do it so well that it is hard to quibble. Annie's voice is as good as it would ever be recorded. The use of a full orchestra on this one is effective and adds a nice touch to the overall scope of the disc. I don't think album rises quite to the level of ""Ashes Are Burning"" or ""Scheherazade"", but of the albums I own I would put just a slight step down from those."
2,Tasmanian Lavender Shampoo,"Did not smell at all like lavender. For the price, I think Davines is much better but it may be a personal preference. Just like Davines, I don't know why these products come in glass for a shower!! Does not make sense."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!!,I thought this would be a funny movie like Bridesmaids..Not even close! Bachelorette is the worst movie ever made and what a waste of $5.99.
2,Didn't know what it wanted to be,I wanted to like this movie- even though Kirsten Dunst is not a fave at all. The movie didn't know if it wanted to be Bridesmaids or the Hangover - and it was hard to really like any of the characters.
2,Horrible,This movie was awful! Would not recommend to anyone. Bad acting from great actresses and no story line. The language was terrible and they tried too he'd to be like the Hangover but didn't even compare. Very upset I wasted money on this however glad I did the before theater rental so I save another $20 from the theater!
2,The fall short Bachelorette,Did not like it. Plot was horrible and so much wasted energy on not being funny. Save your hard earned money.
4,Super funny,"As far as girlie movies go, this was a good one. Kept you laughing for most of the film. Totally entertaining."
1,Didn't really get it,I'm a girl but the catiness displayed in this movie was beyond my understanding of comedy. Maybe they were going for Mean Girls but ended up being too cruel for redemption?
1,This movie is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!,"Save your time and money.....don't watch this movie!!!! It's one of the worst movies I've seen. I had such high hopes for this film because Rebel Wilson is such a funny actress, but her role was very limited. The only two character I liked were the bride and groom; the other characters were horrible. They way this film glamorized drugs and portrayed women is simply disgusting."
2,Not Funny,"The preview makes it look like a comedy. It wasn't (or maybe just wast funny to us). Characters were mean and unlikable. Good cast, bad movie."
1,Not sure if I want my money or time back more.,Not sure if I want my money or time back more. I caved in to my wife's puppy eyes and I am feeling very sad now.
3,Nice attempt,"It was a nice attempt at making the female version of the Hangover. However, there were too many emotions shown that took away from the comedy."
2,Not funny!,Just woman behaving badly. Too much emphasis on drugs. It was even a waste of the money paid to rent.
1,Expected much better,"Considering the cast, I was sure this would be funny. Is wasn't. The story line had promise but all the actors seemed to struggle to be funny. It wasn't even a dark comedy, it wasn't any kind of comedy, just boring."
2,"ok, but not as good as I wanted it to be","I think my title sums it up. I wanted this to be great, but honestly I was a bit bored with it and the cliches. If it's was on tv...maybe I'd watch it, but I'd never rent it again or seek it out."
2,disappointing,"Typical comedy letdown for us. All of the funny stuff was crammed into the trailor but the actual movie just wasn't that great. Crude and too many references to drugs. Kind of like Bridesmaids, except Bridesmaids somehow pulled off all the crude stuff and made it hilarious (except for one scene of the airplane that was a bit much)."
1,Terrible,"I was hugely disappointed in this. I don't think I was able to get through it. Seemed like maybe it was a cheap knock-off of a similar themed movie, but it just wasn't any good at all."
2,Wait for DVD,"Certainly earned a few laughs, but too many drug references and jokes on obesity. The film fell short of satisfying my expectations."
4,such a great black comedy,"such a wickedly dark comedy. i've never hated Kirsten Dunst more! She did justice to that character. Isla Fisher the opposite of Kirsten Dunst who was so good as the ditzy one of the bunch. Lizzy Kaplan and Adam Scott!!!! Adam Scott's best man speech made me spit out my drink. so funny. I do think Rebel Wilson was underused in this movie. She was so amazing in Bridesmaids... she just played this whiny, helpless Bride!"
1,No redeeming qualities,"Awful. There was nothing funny about this film. The plot was stupid and the film was tasteless. I loved Bridesmaids, and if you are thinking that this will be a similar film...it is not. The girls are just mean, and druggies, and have no redeeming qualities. DO NOT WATCH IT."
1,Don't waste your money,"Horrible movie, not worth your money or your time I've already waisted it for you,they couldn't call it the bridesmaids so they called it bacherolette, which you hardly see during the whole damn movie! Stupid waste of film, horrific!!"
1,Horribly depressing,"I do not get the point of this movie. It was not funny or sexy, the soundtrack was ok, but the story-line was depressing. If I had friends like these I wouldn't invite them over for dinner never mind a wedding."
1,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to watching this movie but it wasn't as funny as I thought it would be...I don't find women using drugs funny, I guess! The Hangover with women characters...I didn't like The Hangover, either, so if you liked that, maybe you would like this."
1,Bachelorette movie,This movie was disappointing to say the least. All of the good scenes are captured in the trailer. It was not worth the $10.99 to watch it early.
1,"Say ""I DON'T"" to Bachelorette!","I am a very easy grader and that is why I gave this movie one star. This movie was the worst movie I have seen in a very, very long time. I don't know what was more painful - watching this movie or remembering that I paid $10 to watch this movie.I am a huge Chelsea Handler fan and I watched this movie because Chelsea Handler raved about it on her show. My decision to watch the movie was also influenced by the high customer reviews.I did not laugh once during the entire movie. The acting and the dialogue did nothing for me. I loved Hangover and Bridesmaids but Bachelorette was not for me."
2,Disappointing,"Rented this to see Rebel Wilson, but she was only in about 10% of the movie. Just disappointing all the way around."
1,NOT Funny at all,"This movie was depressing. These woman are horrible people... ick. I felt soooo bad for the bride through out the entire movie! It looks like it would be a fun comedy, instead, i could not wait for it to be over!"
1,This movie was terrible. What a waste of money,All I can say is these amazing actors and actresses must have been desparate for money. Lots of F bombs and a poor story line. Not funny at all
5,Charmed VI,"I've been reading the reviews on this season and a lot of people have issues with the sixth season.After seeing all eight seasons people it wasn't a bad season at all.The last episodes of the season were so good,season seven couldn't help but pale in comparison.To the potential buyers of this season,I would say go right ahead.Without a doubt,season six had more humor than 5,7 & 8 combined.To the people that are saying ""humor? It's supposed to be about the supernatural."" I say lighten up.Over the course of eight seasons,I think you're entitled be silly every once in a while.Yes I could have did without a couple of the episodes,but overall season 6 is one of the better Charmed seasons."
5,Just what I needed,I haven't been able to find this season in any stores for my Daughters collection and was thrilled not only to find it here but at a much better price then the stores were selling it for.Arrived quickly and in perfect condition!
1,i did not get this dvd,I order season 6 and 5 i only got the season 5 and the 6th one was not in there :( wtf
5,Great DVD!,"Just Great. I loved it! Charmed in the best TV show I've ever seen. Filled with action, adventure, comedy, drama. Great entertainment!"
4,"Not the best, but still 'Charmed'","In typical Charmed fashion, this season is no letdown as far as vanquishes, humor, and skimpy outfits are concerned. Much of the season is spent trying to fill in gaps in the storyline - basically keeping Wyatt from turning evil or keeping evil from killing Wyatt. The sisters continue their awesome performances in the sixth season which, although is not my favorite season, still keeps fans inthralled with the show and leads to an amazing ending. If you love Charmed, you'll love this season just as much as the rest!For the release date for season 8, make sure you check out this site - [.....]I can't wait for the final two seasons on DVD! I'm looking forward to completing my collection! I'm currently watching my first 6 seasons all the way through, from the first episode to the last...sometimes, I just can't get enough of this show! Enjoy everyone!"
3,Decent Sports Trivia Book,"the book is a little dated but it has some great questions. It ranges in difficulty as well from easy to absurd. The book is set up in a round format where it has category rounds where the questions all have some similarities, which can be nice. It's a good book to have laying around to stump people and see how good your sports trivia knowledge is because it does have a wide variety of categories. Other than some of the questions being obsolete due to when the book was published, it is a good book for a good price with an easy to understand format that you can use to play as a fun game with friends and family."
3,Hard-Boiled with Capital 'H' and 'B',"The Kirkus review of this book was fairly devastatingly nasty, but honestly the only defense I can offer is that it isn't as bad as all that. Condemning it with faint praise, I realize.Anyhow-- the debut Blaine Stewart novel. It introduces her gun, her dead ex-husband, her drinking problem and her itchy trigger finger. Starting to get the drift? Even with all this, Zukowski has a flair for her writing and it manages to be reasonably entertaining despite the cliche-ridden backdrop. No small accomplishment."
3,Not bad,"This book was moderatley exciting and enjoyable. However, it could get quite boring at times. It's the story of a girl who disguised herself as a boy to escape an unwanted marriage. But, Elfwyn, this girl has no self confidence, no spunk and I found myself feeling bored as I followed the story of her half hearted attempts to escape and find herself. The climax of the book proves that she is yielding and supports the king who wanted her to marry a man old enough to be her grandfather. I was dissapointed by this book as a story, but I'm sure as another reviewer remarked that the historical information in this book was interesting even if I personally did not appreciate it.I think I might be a little too old for this book as it is recommended for ages 9-12. Being 14 myself I was not so enteretained by it."
3,Maybe better than having no book at all,"One can only hope that the world will one day harbor only one and possibly last assassin. I fear that the closest we'll get is this book title. But however intriguing its title, the book is a potboiler featuring rather plodding and humorless characters whose only purpose is to carry out the plot. It's one of those novels that can be scanned quckly without fear of missing some clever dialog or particlularly apt turns of phrase. If you need something on a flight or while your car is repaired, this will serve quite well."
3,the last assassin,"I HAVE ENJOYED ALL OF BARRY EISLER'S BOOKS. GOOD THEMES AND EASY READING.THERE ARE A FEW AUTHORS THAT I TRY TO READ, AND BARRIE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES."
4,Exciting Espionage - Powerful Couples,"This is another winning John Rain novel. I love spy stories and the intricate planning of assassinations in these stories. Delilah Rain's Mossad associate and lover is a fascinating character. I recently read another espionage novel, THE PERFECT ASSASSIN by Ward Larsen. In this high excitement novel David Slaton, an Israeli assassin gets forced into an alliance with Christine Palmer, a young American physician and, like Eisler's characters, they form a powerful couple engaged in high action drama. Both of these books are great reads."
5,Brilliant concept,"Shepard's work has been seminal to mine as a bioacoustician. I am only sorry I came to realize the importance of his efforts so late in the game. In particular, the ideas expressed in Coming Home...shed a very bright light on our otherwise muddled thinking about our ancient human roots and our current ecological struggles. At the same time, I can well understand why other readers might feel challenged. His ideas are sometimes difficult to grasp and expressed in ways that might otherwise be presented more clearly. However, if one has the patience and the perseverence, the walk is well worth the effort. I like to be made to reconsider my strongly held convictions. Shepard's work has never failed to add great value to my life in that regard."
4,"really eye-opening and convincing arguement,","this book really makes sense in explaining the human desire for wilderness, and why we are facing so many phsycological and physical problems, and debilitations today. We are out of our environment and trying to contradict our genes...as humans this is an incredible insight into human nature and environmental issues...i highly reccomend it"
1,Blue Magic is Magic,this is the best product we ever tried on our carpets and rugs. We received a sample of this product from one of our friends in the hardware business.We first tried it on our carpeting that had some long time pet stains. We followed the directions and to our amazement the stains just came right out.I would not hesitate to reccomend this proudct to anyone.
2,Blue Magic blues,"This product really did clean my pet stains quite well. As long as it worked, that is. The aerosol spray has stopped working after no more than eight to ten uses. The can feels almost full when I shake it but nothing comes out. I am switching to a non aerosol product in hopes that it cleans as well as this one, but works until the can is empty."
5,Works GREAT! (ESPECIALLY with dog stains!),"This product works! We have white carpet!! My dog likes to mark his territory in the house and now this product removes pee stains(even old ones) with ease! Its awesome! We got our carpets cleaned and literally a few hours after we had it cleaned, my dog got sick and got diarrhea all over the carpet!! Thank God for this product!! It got all of it out and you cant even tell that there was a stain!"
2,Didn't get the coffee out of the carpet,I bought this product to get a rather large coffee stain out of a light-colored carpet. It didn't do it.
2,BOWLS ARE JUST TOO SMALL,"In comparison to other Corelle sets ( such as the ""Impressions"" line ), these are quite small. Suitable for portion control, children, fruit, dip, etc. but not as a full size bowl an adult would use at mealtime. Otherwise the quality is here."
5,Wonderful compilation.,"If you can find a DVD or VHS of this album, get it, too! The scenery (and photography) is breathtakingly beautiful."
1,Le plus pourris comme film du quebec,"On aurait pu faire mieux, c'est un film vraiment trop long et très pourris. Pas d'action un simple amour auquel il n'y a aucun rapport. En terme simple c'est un film qui fait pitié et qui ne mérite pas d'tre acheter, ou mme regarder."
3,Good story line...,"Lysette Kersaint is being married off by her set abusive stepfather to Etienne Sagesse a man that is hateful and she loathes very much. She runs away ending up at the widow, Maximilien Vallerand's home and is taken in by him. He wants revenge on Etienne Sagesse due to that fact that Etienne was once his wife's lover. Max's disceased wife's death was questionable and Max is still thought to be a murderer. Etienne will be do anything to get Lysette and Maximilien is determined not to turn her over to him. One way to keep Lysette away from him is by marrying her himself. And that is just what he does- not thinking that he will lose his heart to her. Now Etienne is really set on getting revenge on Maxmilien while Maximilien is working against Etienne and Lysette is the pawn. It is an exciting story (one that I at times found boring, though). Maybe that was just me. I would recommend it as a read but not one to buy. There are better out there. Just my opinion."
4,Good Story,I have read some of the negative reviews about the May-December age difference. Anyone who has done genealogy of their family will find many May-December ages in the 1800's and earlier since it was very common. I found the story to be well written and very good. It was an interesting book - not my favorite but it was good. I found the heroine to be a bit too strong-willed for the story and didn't care for her as much as if she were maybe a bit more grateful of being saved.
2,the new politically correct version,"I bought the book without reading the summary because it was a book by Lisa Kleypas and I love her. My favorite book is Only in your Arms. Imagine my disappointment when I realized its the same book, not new or improved, simply modified to make the main characters more politically correct. Lysette was made over to appear more strong and educated. She was a much more likeable character without this makeover. Part of the beauty of the first book was that she was nervous and unsure but still wielded a mysterious power over her husband Max and her stepsons. While the new version is not totally bad I ended up being very disappointed."
2,Worst Kleypas novel I've attempted to read,Couldn't finish it: characters just weren't like-able or deep. Plot and dialogue were abrupt and trite.
3,I prefer the original version,"I guess I am the only one who prefers the original version. In this rewrtie, the author has made the heroine so independent and assertive that she no longer fits with the historical setting of the novel.Lysette is supposed to be a sheltered Creole maiden but in this new version she is the embodiment of the modern American woman. Her actions and attitude are no longer consistent with the historical period in which the story is set. It felt like I was reading a time travel story, where a woman from 2003 travels back to the 1800's.It is still a great romance and if you have never read the original, I am sure you will enjoy it. I just regret that the historical accuracy of the novel has been sacrificed to make the novel more ""PC""."
1,Love Lisa Kleypas - Hated this makeover!,"I was so dissapointed in this remake! The only thing that was changed was making Lysette unattractive. I'm sorry, that is just too un-original for me. This is honestly the worst Lisa Kleypas book I have ever read. Generally, I adore her books - I found myself wanting to burn this one. Only in your arms was a great book - one of my favorites. I think I'd like to remember the story the way it was."
4,Good Work Out: Too Much Money,"I was in the Marine Corps and really enjoyed the work out, but $25.00 is was too much money for it. This is a $10.00 DVD. If it had more than one session on it, I may say different, but you will get bored doing the same workout every time. I also love the fact that Amazon.com made it $24.95 instead of $25.00 so it wouldn't qualify for free shipping.However a previous reviewer was correct in that you don't have to have a circuit course at your house. I was able to do most everything with just a set of dumbbells."
3,good for a basic starting work out,"This is more of an example of the exercises that are done in boot camp, without much explanation as to the correct way to perform the exercises. I was hoping for more of an instructional video than a video that you can work out with."
5,Pain Free Program Works,"SteveIn 1996, I met Anthony Carey at a Health Fair in San Diego, California.

5,Great game,"I think I remember reading that this is a 3-4 hour game. Granted, until you get used to the rules, it will be slower than normal, but my brother and I took close to 16 hours to finish our first game. It is a great game, however. After a few battles, you get an idea as to what it involves for your particular army to win. Essentially, the Dark Lord must attack and the Free Peoples must defend. It really is a lot of fun if you have the time and can walk away for awhile until you can rejoin the fight. I got the feeling I was playing a classic military board game. It's very fun rolling dice, drawing cards, etc. Highly recommended."
3,"Nice cart, bad bolts","I agree that there's a bolt problem with this cart. It's a sturdy cart, but the bolts rattle out quickly, and the cart was actually defective when I got it. (Still functional, and I needed it for a job, so I kept it.) The bolts that hold on the wheels screw into a 'female' part inside the platform of the cart. This part had come unwelded on the inside for one screw, so there was no way to get it fixed. I managed to get the bolt out, but that piece is now rattling around inside the platform, and I only have three bolts holding in that wheel. I'm a dance teacher, and I use this cart to haul my sound system around (in stacked plastic crates). Works great on asphalt or around the buildings where I work."
5,simply the best,This cart is simply the best. My daughter and I put it together very quickly and used it right afterward to bring in boxes from her move. We also had a complete computer and copier to bring in and that was ideal. So handy to have and easy to store.
1,UNNSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS,"This movie asks viewers to spend 90 minutes following three talentless actors in the dark looking for ghosts in GREYSTONE PARK, an abandoned mental asylum where---what else---patients were abused and tortured. It's ridiculous---you can't see anything, so why bother making a movie? You won't find a movie as dull and boring as this crapper!"
1,Another wasted opportunity.,"It's All been done before, with NOTHING new. Rent if you have to, or even better, don't bother at all."
1,TRIP EASILY,I BOUGHT THID GATE THINKING IT WOULD BE NICE TO NOT HAVE TO STEP OVER ALL THE TIME. WELL INSTEAD YOU FALL THROUGH. AFTER ONLY A FEW HOURS OF IT BEING UP ME AND MY HUSBAND TRIPPED OVER THE BAR ACROSS THE BOTTOM SEVERAL TIMES THANKFULL WE DID NOT HAVE THE BABY IN OUR ARMS. IT DOES APPEAR TO BE BENT WHEN YOU OPEN IT BUT WHEN INSTALLED PROPERLY THAT GOES AWAY AND IT IS VERY STURDY. THE HANDLE TO OPEN THE GATE IS VERY HARD TO USE WITH EVEN 2 HANDS DO NOT RECOMEND THIS GATE FOR FREQUNTLY USED DOORWAYS.
4,Very nice gate,"I believe the other reviewer is mistaken. I too thought that the gate was bent at the top when we got one (two of them actually). Then I realized that the gate is manufactured like this on purpose. By having the top of the gate be wider than the bottom you can force the gate into the opening which keeps the top of the gate very snug in the doorway. I really like this feature. Since there is no top bar (when the gate is open) this also means the gate has no wobble when it's open. This and the version of the gate with the opener on the bottom (that you step on) are quick solid gates that I would recommend. I will, however, point out that the other review is right, the instructions do not make it clear that gate being ""too wide"" at the top is by design (and quite a good design I might add)."
4,"Works, kind of","This gate does not fit some openings in older homes. We have a 28 inch doorway, which is a tad too small for the gate to go between the frame. We had to jerry rig it with blocks against the wall to get it to work."
3,nice gate but has problems,"We really like this gate. we have 2 kids who will be 2 and 4 pretty soon and after having several kitchen disasters I went and purchased this gate.It is easy to install, looks nice (the cream color blends in well) the only reason I give it 3 stars is that the child lock spring worsk without pushing both red buttons. It is suposed to remain locked and only be able to be opened if you squeese the red buttons on both sides and pull back on the lock. Well the lock can be pulled back w/o the buttons being pushed.But it is a heavy spring and would not be easy for a kid to just pull back anyway. It's nice and tall also."
3,My Pet Gate,"Let me start by saying that we bought this gate to keep dogs on one side of the house, not for use with children.We have small breed dogs and the openings are too large, our chihuahuas fit right through them! We ended up having to put50 or 60 zip ties up and down each side where the largest openings are in order to keep the dogs from slipping through.It is durable, we have been using the same gate in what I would call a very high traffic doorway for several years and it's stillworking great. It's very easy open and swing shut. Except for the large holes it's a great gate."
3,Useful as Pet Gate - except for very small pets,"Our Norwich terrier puppy at less than 10 lbs could wiggle though the gate, now that she's a little bigger she doesn't try that anymore. This gate is not that simple to open but adults get the system after a couple of tries! Suits our needs just fine."
3,"Nice, but limited sizing range.","Be sure to carefully measure the intended opening, and avoid if you plan to use in more than one specific location. Not sure what a ""standard"" door opening should be, but it fits in none of mine.Latch is difficult to open even for an adult, so should have no trouble fooling your toddler.Seems well constructed, and once fitted locks in place well."
1,Buyer Beware !!!,"I have puchased 2 of these units and both have broken within a year of purchase.. Internal workings are very cheap and crack easily.. Had to be creative keeping the second one working because any of the parts that may break are not replaceable..Hard to replace entire unit, but your pretty much committed after drilling 4 1/4 inch holes through your tiles to install.. Spend a little more and save the headaches..."
5,Track listing,"GERMAN import CD has 10 tracks:1. Platform 92. Feel It3. Theta State4. Dreams (Original)5. Redemption6. Global Harmony7. Hope8. Sounds of Jupiter9. Redemption (Ambient)10. Dreams (Crunched Up Mix)AUSTRALIAN import CD has 2 bonus tracks as well:11. Dreams (Deluxe 12"" Edit)12. Dreams (Carl Cox Remix)"
3,Pet sling,"I had to return this item because it would not work for my dog. I have a very long, slender Dachshund, and it just was not comfortable for her. It might have worked better if it had a solid bottom, but it just curved too much and her head was at an awkward angle to be out over the top. Probably would work well with smaller, shorter or taller dogs."
1,Not such a good carrier,"Trying to carry your dog in this ""pouch"" is like trying to carry your dog in a hammock that's slung over your shoulder. Don't waste your money. There is no ""platform"" on which your pet can sit, so s/he clings to the top of the elasticised opening. It feels very insecure, I'm sure.If you wanted to take yor pet somewhere without her/him being seen, forget it. The pouch is to insecure for them to feel safe.."
3,pet carrier,"I was hoping Rudy (11 lb maltese) would fit better, and that I could bring him along on walks with the 2 big girls, however, its not all I hoped. It is better than the over both shoulder type."
3,Didn't work for my older pug,"I have an older pug with hip problems and bought this to help me carry her around the house. Unfortunately, it is made out of a stiff, backpack material and my pug was not very pleased when I put her in there. When I set her up and then put the strap over my shoulder, it was awkward for both of us - the sling carrier did not seem very sturdy and my pug was scared because of this. I'm returning it and will stick to carrying her the old fashioned way."
4,"Great concept, and the dog loves it!","This sling is very durable and the wide strap is very comfortable across my shoulder. I have a 3 lb MinPin/Chihuahua who loves to be carted around in it. It's way too big for him, but I hook his collar to the lobster clasp at the front of the sling (great safety precaution) and he sits more towards the front on a folded-up blanket. It's great for being hands free, and worked great at the farmers market and around the house. He may get a little too hot in it during hot days, though. It may be too much sling for chihuahuas and yorkies, I'm still waiting for something a little more simple and something that holds him closer to my chest, but it's safe and it works well."
4,Cool but takes too long,"I have recently just purchased a perler beads bucket that brang 6,000 perler beads . I have already made a lot and a lot of creations ! However my ironing paper that came in the bucket got cut and all mest up because of my brother . So I have been waiting for this product for so so long . I think it is coming all the way from hong kong . Over all I think you should buy this product , however it is going to take a long time to arrive . This product deserves 4 **** stars"
5,Don't read this. Buy the book. You won't regret it!,"This is one of two books that have succeeded in making me not notice the budding tap-dancer seated behind me on a plane (and the other was by JRR Tolkien, so that says something). The ""sports book"" label is a misnomer; the baseball is really secondary to the friendships.This book is about a boy and a man who change one another's life. It is laugh-out-loud funny, it is moving, and contrary to other reviews I found it completely believable--Joey Margolis is so unusual that his exploits seem completely within his abilities, but at the same time he has very human flaws. The time you've spent reading this review could have been put to better use reading the book!"
5,laughed and cried,This is one of the most touching and hilariously funny books I've read in a long time. I have gone back and re-read portions of it several times. Be prepared for a good cry (or several).
3,read the fine print,"I was expecting a large board book like the ""Sheep in a Jeep"" book we own. I didn't read the dimensions, and when it arrived, I was surprised that it is more of a travel size book. The illustrations are much easier to enjoy in the larger book, and we haven't spent much time in this book, mainly because it is so small."
5,They're at it again!,"Those crazy sheep are nothing but an accident looking for a place to happen! They can't keep out of trouble, and that just tickles my 5yo son and I into hysterics. The entire batch of sheep books -- and the only thing wrong with them is there's just not ENOUGH of them -- are just as funny the first time they're read as they are the 20th time. They're a great source for the ""what do you think will happen next?"" prompt, the ""what do you think they should have done instead?"" prompt, and for reading lessons as well."
1,Garbage gloves,"If your hands are bigger than a child you will not fit in these gloves. I wonder if my seller gave me cheap knock offs they are so small. Quality is bad also. Who are these people that like these gloves? Too small too cheap the real deal, garbage."
5,Great Tuna! But Packing some Heat!,"I ordered a case of all three flavors Amazon offers. All were wonderful! It's about the same liquid to fish ratio as standard tuna, except instead of water you pour down the sink, you get very well seasoned sauces. The ""Spicy Chili"" flavor features a wonderful tasting sauce with chunks of chili, but be warned this stuff packs some heat. I have a fairly high tolerance for spicy foods and this was just right for me. 170-calories (give or take)per can. Throw in some mini carrote and a few crackers, and you have a very satisfying meal for very few calories. (.....)!"
2,it is awesome yet terrible,"this controller is so awesome mainly for the fans. The controller is terrible, the buttons are a bit off and the only game that i have found that works with the controller is Halo, of course. the fans are very usefull and work great but the problems, iv tried this on 3 xboxs and on all of them it doesnt work especially on medal of honor so the controller is probly a waste of money unless you are using it for LAN parties or a marathon of halo."
4,Nubian Heritage Coconut& Papaya soap,"Soap smells so good and even lathers up more than others soaps, skin feels great and smooth will try other combinations"
3,Should have been better,"A pair of young lovers gradually discovers that they are integral parts of a centuries-old Satanist conspiracy to rule the world. A good idea that begins well is largely undone by mediocre prose and plotting that fails to integrate the threads of its story. The most fascinating aspect of the novel, the revelation of a secret history of warfare between the Catholic Church and a powerful dynasty of Satanists, is tossed off in a series of asides that turn out to have little to do with the main story. We are set up to anticipate the arrival of a certain character who is dispatched as soon as he pokes his head up. Whitley Streiber could have done better."
2,OK book for kids learning diverse words.,Its an OK story though the book takes a different approach and repeats to a dullness the prince's names over and over again.
5,Great GF flour,I bought this based on other reviewers and they weren't wrong. It has produced perfect results with everything we've tried it with from Lava cakes to french bread (used a GF recipe but this flour for suggested blend). It's used to thicken things when all purpose flour is called for too. There is no aftertaste which is important. My next experiment is onion rings and cookies. I'm pretty sure I'll continue to be happy and buy this if Amazon can keep it in stock.
5,"Go, Leigh!","I am a longtime fan of Sixpence None The Richer and was sad when they disbanded...however, if you too were a fan of Sixpence, Blue on Blue will not disappoint! Leigh's voice is magical and oh, so soothing. She has a mighty talent and I will look forward to her next release with great anticipation!"
4,Earth bound flight,"Unlike Jonn's totally SPACE releases, ""Tingri"" seems to have been the vehicle that he experimented with while refining his craft. Although the CD never really gets into space, it does contain more enjoyable tracks than flops. ""Midsummer Century"" is very similar (only more spacey) and makes a nice pair for collectors."
2,Tiny Zombie Army,"I didn't realize how small these zombies are, or that they were all the exact same zombie. They're downgraded from present to stocking stuffer. Overpriced and unpleasant-smelling, they will probably still make decent targets for a Nerf gun."
2,Eh...it didnt survive a week,"The kids liked it but it didnt last a week, they little plastic bits at the top fell out and arms didnt move at all."
4,Sprinkler fun for little ones,"This item is inexpensive and so much fun for our grandchildren. They are young, so I don't know how it would be with older children.Just having the water available would probably be fun enough.We had none of the problems that others had, with keeping it stabilized,It is a really fun and different item."
5,A must read!!!,"From the moment I picked up this book, I could not put it down. It's sad and yet amazing to see how Mayada's life goes from normal one day to being in complete upheaval the next. The book really shows you the craziness that existed under Saddam Hussein's rule over Iraq. After reading this biography, I totally understand why the Iraqis were almost afraid to celebrate the end of Saddam's rule. This man was as ruthless as one could get.By the way, I've read other books from this author and she is wonderful. (...)"
5,Sasson does it again,"I am a Saudi national , and after Ms. Sassons book Princess , I believed that nothing would surpass it , but after reading Mayada Daughter of Iraq , I find it hard to decide which was better. The feelings submitted in this new book make it hard for any reader to put down the book after starting with the first page.A must reading if you want to understand what is happening in Iraq.Thank you Ms. Sasson for your wonderful booksA. Al-Rajih"
1,Back to Mine - Not Worth A Dime,"If you are looking for something like his Coastal Breaks, Tectonics, albums that made him known, look elsewhere. It starts off with rock, huh? I wonder if this could even be classified under electronica. Yeah, I was shocked, kept listening, and was even more shocked at how worthless my 20 bucks had so quickly become. This CD is more suitable for a proper game of frisbee golf. I wish I could return, but of course not if it's opened."
3,ATN Brief,"Decent brief, better than the store and K.C. major brand. The peach matting is a plus, but consider inserts due to low capacity."
2,Low Voltage,Voltage with no load reads 110.0. Voltage with 240 watt load AC reads 105.0. This low voltage may be unacceptable for use with a refrigerator.
2,Fails because button falls off,"Overall the case is nice, and offers decent protection. However, the red tab attached to the body is not attached well. The button falls off."
5,A Must Have Cookbook,Lone Star to Five Star is a must have cookbook because of the many types of recipes for all dining occasions. My wife loves making different dishes because she finds there are so many delicious recipes in the book.
3,For the sailing enthusist.,This book is full of usefull information for the transitional sailor. Lots of good stuff for someone thinking of heading out. Some what dated but good to know none the less.
4,A good read,"If, like me, your favourite episodes of Charmed were the ones that centred around the Halliwell family past and present, then this is the book for you. A collection of short stories that are about the Halliwell family, The Warren Witches recount the magical adventures of almost every Warren witch named in the show; Charlotte Warren, Melinda Warren, Prudence Warren, Great-great-aunt Brianna, P. Baxter, P. Russell, P. Johnston, Penelope Halliwell, Patricia Halliwell, Piper, Phoebe and Paige Halliwell, even Paige's future children and grandchildren. A must have book for every die-hard fan."
1,Could be better,Blade is very flimsy. It is not very good at jabbing through sheet rock but it cuts it very well. I don't care for it.
1,Slow Game,"If you want a good game, get Soldiers of Fortune. This game, Heroes of World War II takes too long to get anything accomplished, due to having to be in charge of every little detail that is done with the men, machinery, etc. It reminds you of the Simpsons Game, but in war mode. Not my cup of tea."
1,"Great idea, but very poor quality",The general idea of this product is great. Its low profile allows doing job in very tight places. Unfortunately it failed during the first use. Long axis has moved out under load because it is held inside plastic body just on friction. This caused disengagement of gears. I went to manufacturer's website and read their instructions that do not allow drilling holes more that 3/8 in wood. Even tightening of 2inch screws assumes higher force. What a screwdriver is it that you cannot tighten even small screws?Return policy however is great!
5,great adaptor,this realy let's you get into all the tight spots .I bought it for just one job but have used it many times
4,Great addition to toolbox!,This is great for getting into tight spaces. The design is made to last and the molded grip makes it easier to handle at any position.
1,Off center and grindes when turned,Cheaply made and poor quality. The drill turns off center. The internal gears bind and grind when turned. Made in China...
3,Not the best fossil,"I purchased this watch as a gift, and when it arrived I was hesitant. The hex links in the braclet cause the face to sit at a very unusual angle, almost as if it would be better suited to sit on the side of your wrist. But overall, it looks good for the price."
4,Would be Great Fun if it didn't Leak Water,"This toy straight from the box leaked water under one gun and soaked the kids in that bunker. The blue side was great fun, but the orange side has a leak where the hose connects to the gun and there is no way to get to it to repair it. I am deflating them and returning today."
2,Huh?,"This is just a bunch of basic stretches you'd do at any aerobic class. There isn't a ""routine"" in here to follow, just a instructions on how to do the stretches. Not worth it. Sent it back."
2,Modifications Missing,"This book is useful, but it suffers from a terrible omission. It shows almost no modifications for exercises. This makes it much less useful than it could be for the target audience. As an example, they show child's pose with your head resting on the ground, an unsafe place for many heads to be. They do not show head resting on blocks, head resting on hands, and several other useful variations. The seated twists show legs crossing over and arms doing full wraps, that probably 40% of regular practitioners of yoga cannot do in that form (and I suspect an even larger percentage of the audience for this book). Also, all of the lotus pose pictures have the head improperly positioned, with the face looking forward instead of down and slightly front to maintain spinal alignment. When I saw that I should have returned the book immediately. The sequences are nice, and are short. I will use it, but with the proper modifications that I learned in years of yoga classes."
5,Relieved the pain in my wrists,I have been using this keyboard of about a month. It meets my needs and expectations. My wrists not longer hurt after a days work.
1,poor design,"the keys are sticking and make a lot of noise while typing, that is very annoyingsome of the keys are sticking when depressed.....and its hard to pry them back outwould like a refund"
4,nice keyboard,"This keyboard is pretty nice. The keys are quiet and respond nicely. The split spacebar is such a great feature; you don't have to worry about hitting the spacebar extra hard to type in a space. Two things I have against this keyboard is that it is just so large, and has a lot of unused space that could be potentially used for improvements. There's a space that would be perfect for adding a touchpad, but they chose not to do that. The second thing is the angles of the keyboard aren't the best and still leaves room for improvement.Overall, it's a nice keyboard."
4,like,"I like this shampoo a lot, it makes my hair soft, I do wish however that it had a more interesting smell. it's not unpleasant just not great either."
1,Okay,"I was curious about this product so i bought it at first it was fine, then it dries out my hair and scalp badly. it is a strong product meant for horses. i do not recommend this product to anyone!!"
5,Had to rate this product...,"I bought this on a whim yesterday when I remembered I was out of my old Shampoo. After having heard some good reviews I decided to give mane n' tail a try--and I've only used it once, and my hair feels so light and fluffy and clean! It's not weighed down with anything, which has always been the case with every other shampoo/conditioner set I've used, from Garnier Fructis to Herbal Essences to John Frieda. When it said on the bottle that you should see a difference in your hair after one use I most certainly did not expect it to be true. This is a great product for a great price. If you value your hair, you'll buy this!"
2,Doesn't do anything for my hair.,Nothing special about this shampoo. It doesn't make it shinier or anything that other shampoos can't do. Live and learn.
3,It's a nice shampoo.,I heard about this product from friends. I had such high hopes....it's just a shampoo in a really big bottle.
3,It's okay...,"I'm not quite sure what the big deal about this shampoo is. I got it thinking it would make a difference to the way my hair looks and its health, but it's exactly the same as using my Frederic Fekkai glossy shampoo but with less smoothness. I'm also not really seeing how this lathers very well as others have said. It's pretty standard unless you're not using a good shampoo. Good shampoos and conditioners should always lather. I know everyone reacts to products differently and I'm not saying this is a bad product, I'm just saying it didn't do anything for me. The best shampoo I have ever used in my experience is Alterna Anti-Aging Caviar volumizing shampoo- and it doesn't contain sulfates."
2,Need Coordination to Complete,"I was disappointed in this dvd. The steps are not for beginners. I did do the dance lesson segment a few times and tried the routines a few times. I ended up all tangled up. Julianne has a pleasant personality and the music was ok. People who love to dance and those with more of a dancing background should enjoy it, but others may have lots of frustration."
1,Watch Julianne Dance,"This workout is disappointing and not at all motivating. I love to dance, but I used it once and wanted to return it. I've had some dance experience before, but this workout went way too fast to keep up with. She has a nice upbeat personality, but that's about the only good thing about this video.There is a step guide, where the moves are broken down, but there isn't much repetition in that section. She shows you the move once or twice, and then goes onto the next.I suppose you could stand in your living room and practice them alone for hours to prepare for the workout, but who wants to do that?The actual workout portion is extremely hard, so many whips and turns, it is dizzying!If you've had an advanced dance background and want to get back into shape, I'm sure it would be great; however, her fancy footwork is far too fast for the average person."
3,Not a first time dancer video,"Love Julianne and the idea of this video, but from someone that has never danced before this is not a beginner's video, even after watching the personal instruction I am still struggling. I think she should have done this in front of a live audiance before recording to see how hard this is for beginners. I will keep at it and let you know how long it takes me to get it down."
4,Dance with Julianne: Cardio Ballroom (Purchased on 03/26/2011),is a fun video but more for advanced if u do this one take it easy and just do what u can without getting sore lol it is simple logic if it hurts u won't do it lol she is a wonderful teacher and this a good and fun work out
5,What a fun workout!,"I love this workout because you get to learn dance moves at the same time! I might not be the best at them, but I have fun keeping it up and trying my best. Julianne has put together a fun video that I look forward to doing. The jive is my favorite!"
5,So excited to have this video!!,"If you are a Dancing with the Stars fan like me, and always wish after each show that you could dance like the stars, but don't have a partner to take lessons with -this video is just what you need! Julianne Hough is such a motivating instructor and wanting a body like hers will keep you dancing right along with her!This video is challenging at first, especially if you haven't had professional dance lessons, so I would recommend taking Julianne's private dance lesson first (also on the DVD) before starting the routines. She breaks down the footwork, making it easier to learn and practice before putting all of the steps together. Once you move onto the routines, you will definitely feel your muscles working with all of the twists, turns, and flirty moves! This is a must have for any DWTS fan or for those who want to learn how to Latin or Ballroom dance in the comfort of their own home. Get ready to sweat and shake that booty - so fun!"
3,Not for beginners!,"For some reason I thought this was a beginning ball room dancing DVD. Boy, was I wrong! Lessons are taught at same pace as done on show. REALLY fast. For dancers + people in EXCELLENT health!"
3,Bad views and lack of instruction!,"I bought this hoping it would be as great as the DWTS dvd's, however, she moves very quick through the movements and the video focuses on her top half when teaching feet!!!Overall, it is okay - I am sore the day after doing it and now that I know the moves I will be more prepared. She does offer a dance lesson so I recommend doing that before attempting the workout - I am a trained jazz dancer with very little ballroom experience and found her confusing at times by just jumping straight into the workout"
3,Dance with Julianne,Good workout only to much for me at first. To advanced for beginners!!! Gave it 3 stars because it was to advanced for me and I must say that I can dance but just to hard for beginners.
1,Terrible,"I have the complete Zumba dvd and love it so I thought this dvd would be fun too. Wrong, the dancing isn't even dancing to me. Julianne is annoying to watch. I didn't break a sweat. When I do Zumba I am wiped out and the dancers in zumba you can tell are there to work out and love to dance. Julianne's instructions were not good either. I will stick to Zumba. I've lost 30 lbs so far and do zumba 4 days a week. The music and dance moves are way better in zumba. I thought Julianne's dvd was a joke. But maybe it would be better for beginners. I was surprised this many people rated it high because I bought this based on that. At least it was cheap."
4,"Great, unique novel","A lot of reviewers have said they dont understand where Adrianna got her skills from... well it says that early on she was a math wiz and learned calculus before she dropped out of school at a young age. I thought it was kinda obvious that she must have taught herself (because she is so smart, good at math and logical thinking).This book was interesting because the first part of the book was so different from the last half, as far as tone and action. I found the plot very unique because you get to see both the good and bad sides to living in a Moslem world. I kind of wanted Adrianna and her father to make up somehow, but I guess thats just the optimist in me. Excellent book, I could hardly put it down and finished it in about two days."
3,Entertaining but not the best,"Sweet Revenge was prabably my 20th Nora Roberts novel. I am a true fan but I find that while the book was entertaining it was also very predictiable and seems that it was modeled after countless other contemperary romances. This novel reminds me of another Nora Roberts novel that is much better - Honest Illusions, truely the best she's ever written and also my first Roberts book. If you enjoy stories with cat burglers with a touch of romance you really should read If Tommorrow Comes- by Sidney Shelden, truly in my opinion the best in it's class."
3,something to enjoy,"while it isnt what i expected, it kept my attention. very descriptive and because of this, the reader is able to visualize places and feelings. all in all, a nice read ::smile"
4,from the back of the book,"Augustine's notions of human nature and of person have not received adequate systematic treatment, despite their centrality to all the important areas of his thought. Although he notoriously changed his mind on many major points, his explorations of human nature and person remained central and to a great extent consistent across his mature and most important works. In this insightful and accessible book, the author examines the crucial issues in Augustine's understanding of these two related subjects and concentrates on Augustine's fullest development of that understanding."
4,pretty good,"A mediocore(?) cd. Im not as fond of this cd as their others, but it is still pretty good. Oh yes, all the songs flow and have great sound, but the lyrics are rather repetitive. It eventually gets old, hearing a guy sing about his girl or the one he wants/needs for 30 minutes straight. I still listen to it often, but it definitely is not up to slick shoes standard. And also, the recording was done all that skillfully because it is sorta faded and all. Buy it if you are a long time supporter, but other than that, go for a different one."
5,Re publish please....,I have worn out my copy of this text. I sure wish it would be published again. Anyone know of the prospects of it coming into print again? Please email me with the facts. I cannot FAX without this book!
4,V-Ice is the Rodney Dangerfield of music...NO RESPECT,"I'm a big Ice fan. People completely slept on Mind Blowin (a great party album)...and have been dissing him ever since. His new album is good, don't get me wrong, but I have a problem with a couple things. Why is he putting the same songs on here that were just on the last album?! O.K.S and Detonator were just on his last album. Dunn Natt is a rework of an old song - the lyrics are identical. However, my man's got skills and doesn't get the props he deserves. There's a nice mix of grooves, beats, raps and singing. There's a nice blend of rock and hiphop. Keep it up ice. Give it a chance and I think you'll like what you hear."
4,The Mermaid's Purse,"This is a great book. Cute love story and fun characters. It was a quick read, I read it in an afternoon. The love scenes are clean and sweet so I would rate it PG."
1,"Dreadful warmed-over ""Sandalista"" tripe","Longtime pro-Sandinista activist Joan Kruckewit's apotheistic account of ""red-diaper"" baby, part-time clown and part-time Sandinista militia man (read the AP, LA Times and Dallas Morning News accounts at the time of Linder's killing) is a truly painful exercise in dreadful, warmed over ""Sandalista"" tripe. Tendentious, poorly written and dull, and playing fast and loose with the facts. The ultimate critique must be that the red and black mafia for which Ben Linder gave his life hasn't won an election since 1984 and is a totally discredited and corrupt political force. A really misleading and mediocre book about a controversial period in Latin American politics that polarized America."
2,Incomplete book,"it might be a good beginner's book for understanding the basics of web services. When you start dealing with realworld web services architecture situations, all you get from this book is just how to make a simple hello-world JAXRPC, JAXM example working -- beyond that i had no more use of the book. The chapters on SOA, transactions, practical considerations, security are nothing but theoretical junk with no example proof. After browsing all the pages, I don't find anything which show how to build a working java Web services architecture. The word architecture is abused and does'nt make sense for this title."
5,Building block for distributed systems,"This is clearly the book for architects and is not entry level. Any thoughts that a general audience would read this title are shattered by the end of chapter 2. A working knowledge of both Java and XML are a prerequisite. That said, I recommend this book for developers who quickly want to get rolling with web services. The authors waste no time in diving right in and giving developers the tools and hands-on experience that they crave. The book has good code examples and even screen snaps! Altogether, this book is a great way for developers to learn about web services."
2,Very tedious book,"This book is so long getting to the point, it really is a pain to read. It has 800+ pages, a lot too many. Verbose and repeating itself, just frustrating."
2,Book need updates.,This book may be a good book sometime ago. I find the chapters now needs an update. the code discussed in the book not working now. The CD has got only old code and software.
5,Great resource for the average Vanagon owner,I think I have just scratched the surface with this manual.I was able to understand my engines hydraulic lifters and why they are noisy.Seems that worn lifters lose thier oil if sitting to long. (Bleed out)I feel that I may be able to replace the lifters by myself using the manual.I was lost before and now I'm informed.A must have for vanagon owners that can twist a few wrenches.I would recommend this to other Vanagon owners.
5,"Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL","This is an excellent book about heliconias. These beautiful plants are distant cousins to the banana family of plants. The book is well organized and filled with many interesting photos. I loved the info on Heliconia Rostrada (LOBSTER CLAW). By Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL"
3,Better for adults,"This is a great book to learn more about Chinese cultures. Adults would find it more interesting than children. The text and concepts are sometimes higher than your average primary age child. The pictures are artistic, but not exactly kid appeal. Good resource for learning; it doesn't get picked up for leisure reading by kids. I have this book in my school library collection."
4,Great value for the money,"Great vanity mirror, with both regular reflection and magnified. If the oval shape were a bit wider (or even circular) it would be perfect."
3,A likeable collection of music.,"I've had Turn of the Tides for a few years now. It's a pretty good collection of material. The musicianship and production are great as usual. My favorite moments are ""Pictures at an Exhibition,"" ""Firetongues,"" and ""Death of a Nightingale."" ""Firetongues"" is one of my favorite songs from Tangerine Dream. ""Death of a Nightingale"" sports some impressive and emotional soprano sax playing from Linda Spa. The guitar playing throughout the album is very good too. I don't think that Turn of the Tides is excellent, but I do think that it his some great moments in places. Of the handful of releases that I have from this band, this is one that I still listen to sometimes. Worth a listen."
4,"OK, but not my favorite TD CD.","This one is OK. I'm a pretty hard-core TD fan and like this CD OK, but I like some of the 1973-1983 material better and also like 'Goblins Club' better than this but this is better than the 'Private Music of Tangerine Dream CD'.Worth having if you are a Tangerine Dream fan."
2,Save your money.,"I have to agree with those who find this work to be, shall we say, ""lacking.""My Stars go to Fire Tongues; the rest I could do without and in fact feel foolish that I ever paid to hear them. It's a very monotonous collection, and that's about all I can say of it. When people talk about the ""drought"" Tangerine Dream had during the mid 90's, this is the kind of work they're talking about."
4,Awsome!!!,OK YOU MIGHT THINK OH GREAT MEMORY CARDS WHAT ARE THRY GOING TO DO BESIDES WASTE MY MONEY RIGHT.MEMORY CARDS HELP YOU SAVE A GAME AND IF YOU BUY THIS TWO PACK IT IS WAY CHEAPER THAN BUYING TWO OF THE REGULAR PACKS PLUS THESE ARE COOL COLORS!
4,"Reads well, pictures could have more","This book is great - the only thing I would change is the pictures. There's not much to talk about except to say, ""Baby!"" It would be nice if the babies were at least holding a couple items, or wearing colorful clothes you could talk about. Once your baby starts learning to talk, he/she may not find enough here to keep interested."
5,SATISFACTION FOR THIS PRODUCT,I am very pleased with this product. It was exactly as described in the description. Very heavy duty plastic letters which should stand up to years of durable use.
1,too much clucking,"Convincing someone that pet chickens are fun, funny, and fascinating might take a chapter. The anecdotes about the author's hens are convincing in themselves. The rest of the book needs to be more focused and practical, a lot less chatty and repetitious. This book lacks clear structure--wanders around like a hen looking for goodies, and you need sharp chicken eyes to find the few nuggets of practical information."
3,"Adequate, but get the Glyndebourne DVD...","Though this is an adequate performance, if you're going to be a Rodelinda DVD, get the Glyndebourne production. It's simply one of the finest opera productions on DVD, period. Visually, the productions is stunning - all blacks/greys/silvers with the occasional touch of blood red. Every singer is also a consummate actor - both physically and vocally. It also doesn't hurt that it may be one of the most attractive casts ever assembled. To a person, every singer looks like a movie star.Most of all, Anna Caterina Antonacci is far superior to Renee Fleming in this repertory. Her voice may not be as sumptuous, but Antonacci has both a purer sense of style and more profound expression. Her duet with Scholl that closes Act 2 - Io t'abbraccio - is heart-wrenchingly beautiful. (It's on YouTube.)In short, if you're a huge Renee Fleming fan, get the Met DVD. If you appreciate opera performed at the highest level of artistry, get the Glyndebourne DVD.d"
2,Fun for Kids...Bad for Mom,"Great fun for the girls...however the floor door is a tripping hazard. Also, the directions say for best results store flat and when we tried to follow the directions to fold into storage bag the tent was never the same. The seam split after a week of indoor use so I finally returned it."
1,What a disappointment,"It is very seldom that I will start reading a book and then abandon it. However, in the case of The Red Cotton Fields I am sorely tempted to do just that. A potentially excellent story has been so badly written it almost brings tears to my eyes. Reading it has become something of a chore. Apart from spelling and typing errors, the author seems to have forgotten about the use of pronouns. I will make every effort to finish reading The Red Cotton Fields, if only to see if there is some redeeming factor towards the end, but I have only awarded it one star because I was required to."
5,Very soft and cute bear,"I got this as a gift for a friend and well I'm not sure how much she likes it. It was everything I expected it to be, very soft and the ""fur"" is silky smooth. Everything about this screams Hug me."
2,A poor historian and a poor book,"The author Seager adds nothing as a historian. In fact, blindly believing the worst of the historical sources, he does the modern reader a disservice by being insufficiently critical.In particular, Seager blindly accepts Tacitus' description of Sejanus and in doing so ignores the most basic of contemporary scholarship on the subject.For example, Seager says p181 that Sejanus planned to kill most of Tiberius heirs.Seager says Sejanus didn't kill Drusus, but he would have done it anyway p185.Very disappointing."
2,its not very good,"i got this gun about a week ago and it looked really cool. when i shot it, it worked great. then, as i kept shooting it got busted. it was because i put too many b.b.s in it. also, i was shooting it and a b.b. got stuck inside of it. then i tryed to load it to get it out but the thing you pull back to load if snaped and now its broken. but, when it shoots, it was really acurate."
1,CRAP!!!,"I bought this gun thinking it looked like a cool and fun gun. I go through 1 freakin war with it and the thing wont cock any more and pieces are falling off it. I know how to treat guns but this is ridiculous, and for the record im not a kid im just to lazy to sign up!"
2,dull,"This book only affirmed to me what Truman Capote said about Saul Bellow, ""Saul Bellow is a dull writer, and a dull man."" This is certainly a dull book."
1,Multi Function Meter NOT WATERPROOF,Unit is sold as a motorcycle accessory.Not suitable if you are riding outdoors in the real world.The unit is NOT WATERPROOF.It is an AUTOMOTIVE accessory mislabeled MOTORCYCLE!
5,Excellent Cookbook,"This cookbook not only provides you with recipes, but provides information on the benefits of the ingredients."
4,Good cookbook for my kitchen collection,"Regardless of your diet, this is a good book to have in your collection. The recipes are not only healthy, but they are flavorful and colorful and spicy."
4,Only one complaint,"When I saw Tegan and Sara in concert last year, I was won over by the ladies' great sense of humor and amusing anecdontes which made the concert that much more enjoyable. On this DVD, you get a sense of that in the bonus materials, but the concert itself has just the music. It's a great show, but I would have loved to see the whole unedited show including between song banter. The music videos are cool as well. Definitely worth picking up especially considering the price!"
4,I love Tegan and Sara.,"Not as good as the dvd included with The Con. The production quality isn't as great, and there's even more bickering. And the live portion edits out all of their stage banter! That's what we all love about Tegan and Sara!But overall, if you're a T&S; fan, it's worth your money. I can't get enough! I love these girls!"
1,Jan has better albums out,"I really like Jan Hammer's work. I like his stuff with John McLaughlin, Al Dimeola, Neal Schon, and Jeff Beck. I like his solo stuff such as his music for Miami Vice and Beyond the Mind's Eye. But I could not stand this CD. I do not know what he was thinking when he wrote this music. I was so disappointed I sold the album - there was not a single song I liked to justify keeping it."
3,Tip gets clogged,Tip sometimes gets clogged and getting it cleaned out can be tedious. Perhaps it should come with a cleaning tool
1,Water Pik warranty,"I have bought several cordless water piks (WP360W) and the battery always gives out. The last one almost made two years. Since they have a two year warranty, they replaced it free. However, the second one only lasted 7 months and they would not replace it again. I found customer service to be less than friendly. Maybe they are tired of all the complaints. I would think the company would try to improve their model. However, they keep making money because customers have to keep buying new ones. I will not buy another one and am looking at other brands."
3,Recommended for Travel Use Only,"I had originally written a much more favorable review of this one-piece cordless WaterPik, but after some months of use, I have found it to have some real power problems. Basically it has nowhere near the irrigation power of WaterPik's plug-in models. The nicad batteries seem to be the problem, with a severe case of memory effect. I was having to discharge and recharge the unit every other day to get a few good irrigation sessions. I finally threw in the towel and got a standard plug-in WaterPik, which has much more power and a much larger reservoir as well. So -- I would recommend this cordless WaterPik only for travel use, where it does an adequate, though not superior, job of irrigation."
1,not up to waterpik standards,i agree with other negative reviews...is just too cumbersome and not enough power to do the job..feels like you are putting something the size of a flashlight in your mouth..
1,Waterpik Cordless Model WP-360W,Bought this item Christmas of 2007. The water pik worked well until August 2008 when the battery would no longer hold a charge. The connector for the battery charger easily corrodes. The water tank is a little small have to refill tank. Item made in China.Would not recommend this unit due to its very short battery life.
1,Battery lasted about two months!,"Battery lasted about 2 months. Other than that, it worked pretty good, but with a dead battery that won't recharge - USELESS!!!"
1,Waterpik,"The insertable ""piks"" will not stay in place when using the product, they dislodge and water goes all over the place. I have tried to tighten them but that does not seem to be an option. Can't use the product."
2,Dissatisfied,"Poorly advertised, cumbersome to use and hard to refill barrel or remove from its base.This model doesn't have battery capacity which is especially beneficial for International travel."
1,bad,"I bought this for a long visit with my son, three months. It did not even last three months. No longer works, there should be a better product out there."
3,My Bad,"While marveling at the convenience I missed that the water flow isn't adjustable like the standard model. I need a low pressure waterpik. Guess I have to go back to the plug in model with a transformer for use overseas. Love the product, just not right for me."
1,I sent it back,Reservoir is too small. YOu have to hold it at an odd angle and then keep refilling it every 15 seconds.
1,"Yup, battery makes this worthless...","Yes, I am throwing away my second unit now also, due to battery failure. The unit works great, but 6 months of use on a unit before the battery fails is not a good product. Sorry - I am trying a Panasonic now."
3,Water Pik,This hand held model works fine but the water tank is too small. You need to fill it at least twice.
3,Handheld water-pic - sloppy but effective,"I recently bought this water-pic without having seen it ""in person"". It's kind of bulky, but works well, and you must remember that the water comes out pretty fast so do this over the sink with your mouth slightly open, or you'll drown!! Well, not really, but your mouth can fill up really fast! It does the job well, though, as advertised!"
3,JUST SO-S0,"i bought this for traveling but decided it wasn't powerful enough to do a good job so it wouldn't be worth carrying along on a trip.Also, it needs to be filled at least three times during the cleaning. I could easily do without this."
3,bought this because i got a bridge,"bought this because i got a bridge, but you still need to floss. the price was good from this site, but honestly i don't use it that often, it has a high pressure that makes water squirt out of your mouth and like i said you still have to floss. If you have the time and want to have a freasher mouth then i guess it would be worth it."
1,Junk,"Plugged it in.. waited the specified 24 (!) hours before I could use it. Didn't work. There was a motor spinning somewhere inside it, but no water came out, at least out of the end of the nozzle where it was supposed to. The reservoir leaks all over the place out of both the top and bottom. It's too long to fill conveniently in a typical bathroom sink. After reading the other reviews here about what further problems lay down the road if I were to get a functioning unit, I'm not even going to bother getting a replacement."
3,Works well enough,Adequate for my uses. It runs out of water pretty quickly. Pressure is fine and seems to work pretty well
5,Very satisfied,Am so glad I got this instead of the full size. It works great. I would recommend it to anyone.
1,Don't do it,Great product for two months then would not recharge. When it would still recharge was much better than string flossing. Ability to mix in mouthwash was great. Overall it would be a keeper if it would actually keep working but alas was a piece of junk.
2,good product that doesn't last,"I bought this product at walmart for less than $30. Took it home and it worked great for 3 days. Then stopped. Immediatly returned it for a full refund. The product idea is great, but needs to go back to the drawing board."
1,"Works on your teeth, but only when it works!","I have just finished with my 4TH Waterpik WP360W. The first lasted 6 months, so we bought another one. The second lasted about the same, and this time I had it replaced by warranty (they are pretty good about that, at least). The third one lasted about 7 months, again I returned it under warranty and they sent me another. But I've finally had it as this one has lasted maybe 5 months. Each time, the battery either refuses to continue to charge and you get a weak jet or the whole think just dies (sometimes I can get it started again by banging the base on the counter). The idea of oral irrigation is great, I have much better dental appts since using it (my gum lines have lowered) and its great for a kid who doesn't like to floss - my son uses it twice a day. But I will not buy a waterpik again."
2,"Battery and power troubles, low water capacity","While this is better than using no waterpick at all, and cordless is nice, my experience with this over 6 months has been:CONS- Battery wears down quick.- Over time battery holds less and less of charge. After 6 months I'm lucky to get through 1 or 2 full sessions without it getting ""weak"".- Water resevoir only holds enough to do one side of your mouth. Not hard to re-fill, but a little annoying to have to keep stopping and refilling it for a thorough cleaning.PROS- Better than just flossing, noticably cleaner / better feeling mouth. Better breath.- Much more enjoyable than flossing.- Cheap and portable.- Once you upgrade to a real waterpick system this will make a great squirtgun, you'll win every time in short battles ;-)OVERALLWish I'd spent the extra $16 for a full powered, higher-end system, and will be ditching this for one soon."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Over the years I have been happy using the ac powered WaterPiks so I tried this one when the last ac unit wore out. Big mistake! Within a few weeks the thing quit working. I opened it up and found everything rusted, corroded and totally a mess. Thinking it was a fluke I bought a second; should have known better. It was worse than the first. The engineering on this device is very bad, clearly built by the low bidder. Definitely my last WaterPik!C.G.B."
1,Waterpic,I didn't rate this product as low as I could because it is a useless watepik. To properly use this item it has to be turned sideways and upon doing so you lose water pressure and nothing comes out. I purchased a ultra water flosser waterpik from your company with a separate holding tank and this one works perfectly. Thanks for you effort in taking care of my problem with my first order.Joe Norton
2,Waterpik Oral Irrigator,"I was excited for the first couple months by this product, however, I have gone through two of them and they stop holding a charge. I have tried everything suggested and nothing works. I have also tried the Panasonic oral irrigator and that too stopped working. I wish I could find a similar product that works."
1,Product doesn't last!,This is the second cordless water pik I purchased. The 1st one worked well but stopped working after 7 months. I purchased a second one and now 9 months later it no longer works. I made sure that the unit was properly charged per the instuctions provided. When the 2nd one crapped out I took the unit apart and found the unit was full of condensation. I will NEVER buy another one of these!
1,stinks,"Sometimes you just have to call it like it is.. this product stinks. It sat on my counter for a year. Each time I used it I hoped the experience would be different. It wasn't. Water everywhere, it's bulky and it doesn't clean your teeth at all."
5,Love it,"I love this little device. I bought this one to take along on vacations and visits. I keep it in the car for use when needed. I have the larger one for home. I have implants and the pic is necessary. It gets all kinds of critters out of your teeth after eating!! Actually, I am writing this after I have had it for 1 1/2 years. Still love it."
2,bad design,Reservoir is too small; it needs to be refilled twice for an adult mouth. This unit is too long for our bathroom sink; we have to refill it in the bathtub. Very bad design.
3,not a lot of power,Handy because of size. It does not have as much power as the larger model with the tank. Also does not hold as much water.
1,used product!,"I bought the waterpik listed as a new item. But when it arrived, it was obviously a returned item. The package had been opened and repacked. There was no way to tell if it had been used or not, but I didn't risk it. Since this is a dental hygiene item, I didn't want to use it. It was returned."
1,Great while it last! (about 2 months),"I bought two. Both of them wore out in aprox. two months. I will never by a Waterpik product again. I'm going with a Phillips Sonicare unit, more expensive but I trust their quality."
2,didn't last,"Worked fine for 6 months, I used it every day. Then it started making a big noise and finally quit. Not worth the money for 6 months of use"
1,Shame on Me,"I'm a dental assistant. The two I purchased had short battery lives. Liked the portability. Contacted Waterpik with little assistance. I WILL have a water flosser but not this one or brand. Going to go to corded water flosser. FOOL ME ONCE - Shame on you, FOOL ME TWICE - Shame on me."
3,Waterpik Waterflosser 360W,"Well even thought I saw some of the bad reviews didn't look good for this product I bought one and so far it seems to do a good job of getting food from between my teeth. It may not work as well on someone else, but I like it. It is a little messy and you have to learn how to keep the water in your mouth or let it run out as you use it. I turn it off and start at a differant spots when my mouth fills up with water. Whatever works for you is good. So far the battery issue on the other reviews is'nt a problem yet, sence I haven't had it very long. I hope the warrenty will take care of that if the time comes. If the manufacturer does have a problem with the battery I hope they get it resolved because it is a good little flosser and I love it so far. Lynn from Saint Louis Missouri."
1,Don't waste your money,Do not waste your money on this hand held flosser. Mine lasted only a year before it died and the pressure from the flosser is almost non existent. You are much better off spending the extra money and getting the platinum counter top model. It is far superior and does a much better job. What a disappointment this product is!
1,Fool me twice,"I've had two of these and I'm done. On the first one the power connection oxidized so that it would no longer charge. On the next one the pump gave out. Six months each was my guess at their lifespan. My third will be the Panasonic and we'll see how that works out.Like others say, the battery duration is terrible and charging it is very hit and miss.I'd steer clear of this product."
1,Don't waste your money,"I got this because I thought it would be more powerful and better than the Conair that I had. It is more powerful but the water reservoir is so small that you must keep refilling it again and again if you are going to do as the instructions suggest and spent 5 seconds on each tooth. The water reservoir is less than half the size of the Conair that I already had and it probably empties in around 5 seconds! After refilling and refilling and refilling I put this thing back in the box and shoved it away, I went back to using my Conair."
1,Please save your money...,"Despite the negative reviews, I purchased this product because there are no electrical outlets in my bathroom. I should have heeded the advice! The product did cease to hold a charge within a couple of months of purchase. The resevoir is indeed too small. Mine ended up in the garbage. I now own a Water Pic with a cord which I use in the kitchen! It's fine. Please save your money and do not purchase this item!"
3,lego book,this was a nice book that my son does not look ati continue to point him back to the book as it appearsuseful in making your own plans.
5,Helpfull guide with lots of examples,"As a adult fan of Lego (AFOL) it was a helpful guide in helping meto design and build my own creation (MOC).I now have detailed plans combined with creativity and it has begunto take shape.Like in the real world building your own house;With this book you become archetect, contractor and builder.The book gives a lot of infrmation in 320 pages!"
4,The McCampbell Brothers Were The Real Deal!,"Recruited producers Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, L.A. & Babyface, and the Lewis brothers from Atlantic Starr did help make the McCampbell Brothers debut a soul, urban, club/dance success. The McCampbell brothers made their debut as The Mac Band and did get two very strong songs in the R&B chart topping new jack swing styled ""Roses Are Red"" and ""Stalemate."" They never again came close to landing a big record, and are virtually a forgotten group. The group consisted of the McCampbell brothers Ray, Derrick, Charles and Kelvin (from Dallas by way of Flint), backed by bassist Ray Flippin, keyboardist Rodney Frazier, guitarist Mark Harper, and drummer Steve Fuller (formed Mac Band in Los Angeles)."
5,Bet you can't sit still!,"Their music draws you in and you cannot resist singing along, tapping a toe, lifting a pint. Their instrumental musicianship is fantastic. Although I had all the other CD's by Gaelic Storm, I found this one, like the others, earned high marks and I can listen to it over and over."
4,such a classic!,"So fun to share with the new generation, especially with the recent Alvin and the Chipmunks movies that are so popular."
2,Dave loves money,"In this Christmas classic Dave lectures the chipmunks about the true meaning of Christmas, while simultaneously pimping the chipmunks at a recording session over Christmas vacation. Dave needs the chipmunks to maintain his posh uptown lifestyle, but when the chipmunks try to exercise their entrepreneurial spirit and open up a photo booth, man, do they catch a beating. Dave doesn't want the chipmunks to make money unless he gets his 98%. After Dave discovers Alvin gave his prize harmonica to a sick child, his cold heart melts, and he allows Mrs. Claus to buy Alvin a new harmonica. Actually after watching this 200 times this year, it's starting to grow on me. It's one of my wife's favorites and my 2 year old likes it as well. All of that doesn't help the piss poor animation cheesy story but i guess there are worse Christmas specials."
4,Fun with the Chimpmunks!,"I got this as a gift for an almost-four-year-old who is new to the Chipmunks. Let me tell you it was lots of fun to watch her enjoy it, since we watched and listened to the Chipmunks when we were only a bit older than she. (1958!!)This is a good DVD with three different stories, and every one is a winner. Certainly, you can't go wrong for the price."
4,Great style for the price,"What a deal. This style of watchcase is very contemporary. TW Steel has a model that's very similar to this one @ 8x the price. However, the Corduba has the thicker leather band and the larger case. The photo shows a yellowish dial; but it's more of a cream color.Setting the time is kinda tricky; the pull-out crown is hard to manage. Overall, I give the watch a very positive review and, at this pricepoint, you can't go wrong with adding this one to your collection."
1,Knock off?,"I also bought this watch on Amazon and just realized mine does not say ""Japan Movt"" on the face. When I ordered this watch Amazon it did not tell me it was knock off from the real one! And now it is selling at a price cheaper then ever so if you want it you should get it now, but they should at least refund me the docked down price for giving me a knock off! If you buy it now while it is at its cheapest so far, you too will probably also get a knock off!"
3,Yet Another Invicta,This particular Invicta does catch the eye. The drawback here was the length of the band; way too short. Would be ideal for a guy with small wrists. Weight of the timepiece is substantially lighter. For the price it was quite an exceptional deal aside from the band issue. With time the leather stretches a bit.
3,Not what I was looking for,"I guess I should of looked into the measurements a little closer and the word ""oversized"" in the title. Long story short, I returned the watch And found another Invicta watch that wasn't so oversized.If you're looking to turn heads and have strangers come up to you in public questioning your timepiece then this watch is for you."
2,Not Big but HUGE!,"I really like the look and feel of this watch, however I can't get used to the shear size of this thing. I held it to my wrist and no! Don't get me wrong I like oversize watches, but this one overdoes it. This thing dwarfs every watch I own including my Ebel divers watch. I am pretty sure I will have to send it back.CG"
1,Awesome Design Terrible Execution,Like all Invicta products they are very stylish and dare I saw beautiful but stylish doesn't equal craftsmanship or quality. I have owned two of these bracelets and both broke within the first month of use. The problem was in the clasping mechanism... It simply fell apart due to inferior quality control and shoddy workmanship.. I also have owned an Invicta Russian Diver Watch which I have had to send back to the company twice this year alone for repairs... I also have owned an Invicta Oversized Corduba Watch that has had so many defects that I don't have the time or patience to list them all here.I have not seen an Invicta design that I have not loved but the reality of their craftsmanship does not rise to the level of their design... Buy anything with the Invicta logo on it if you are interested only in a disposable piece of jewelry and not a quality product.
4,great watch,"This is a very good watch. the face is huge and i get a lot of people telling me they they like it. for the price it is, its worth it. only down fall is the band is leather so if you sweat on it, it starts to smell."
1,poor product,"I have had this watch for less than a month, and have worn it only 5-6 times. It is supposed to be water resistant. I have never worn in the pool, but the first time I wore it in the shower it filed up with water. I will be returning it shortly."
1,Read these reviews...pillows too small,"I bought two of these for ~$30 each...I really like the construction. The outside felt good as did the looks of this.I'd be tickled if I didn't have to stuff foam between the pillows to make my watches fit.The PILLOWS ARE TOO SMALL!!!!I didn't heed these reviews. I bought then I returned both displays...SIGH!!!!Well least I tried them..My watches are large mens watches.Seiko Monsters Black and Orange, Marathon Sar, Ecozilla, Casio Pathfinder, Smaller watches like a Traser and Marathon Navigator.They would look swell in this display...BUT THE PILLOWS ARE TOO SMALL...Read and HeedTom"
4,a cultural cornucopia!!,"Wowsers. This book is chock full of information--cultural, biological, historical, literary--pertaining to the human body. Sims has done a masterful job of research; this book springs to life with allegories, allusions and myths, each connected to a particular part of the body. Though not as humorous as Mary Roach's marvelous paean to the cadaver, _Stiff_, this book proves to be just as interesting. If your interest is piqued by the body human, you must read this book. Sims goes much further than what you would find on NOVA--for instance, he addresses the purpose of eyebrows and why Bram Stoker's Dracula presents the true embodiment of evil. You'll sail through this book; although it can be a bit viscous, with perseverance, the reader will learn myriad factoids. It is well written, thoroughly researched and will refocus the reader on the miracle that is the human form."
5,Straight up Death Metal,"This is Embodyments best album. It's death metal at its best. Bruce Fitzhugh from Living Sacrifice appears on Religious Infamy making it the highlight track on the cd with vocal trade offs. The guitars are also noteworthy as well as the incredible bass work on this album. It's unusual to hear a technical bassisit in a death metal album, but this guy does it right. If you want a nice album to thrash to as well as meaningful lyrics, this album is for you."
3,I blew it,"I got this scanner to replace my perfection 1640SU which was working perfectly and suited my needs. I end up scanning at 1200 DPI anyway. The main problem is that the multi-strip frames (35mm or 120)absolutely do not work so I always scan using the film area guide and no individual templates like I had on my 1640 are provided to assist this. It does scan faster and it did permit me to fully scan all of my 6x17 negatives and slides which I could not scan on the 1640...so at least I got something for my money. Oh yes, it does come with Lasersoft and has a reasonably good version of its own, but if you are using CS3 for everything, what's the point?Once you get the negatives positioned correctly and reasonably flat (a bit tricky with 120 film), the film scans are beautiful, exceeding what I can get with my digital SLR."
4,"great scanner, no real competition for this product","I have two of these scanners, they are awesome. To do a great job with negatives it will take about 5-8 mins per image. I have scanned over 20k images with my first one and the second one is working the same as the first.The Epson scan software is a little buggy, I get a lot of ""unable to write to file"". Talked to support but they are unable to resolve. Something about ""not enough contiguous space on disk"" (OS disk is a SSD 128GB with 50gb free). Fails a lot on my 2GHz duo core box about once/day. Quad core box has better luck but still fails randomly. Use RamDisk to create a member disk as use for temp space, this helps."
5,Amazing product; impressive results,"An amazing product, easy to use with impressive results. The ability to individual adjust the scanning properties of each slide/negative allows customization to yield excellent outcomes. Plus it is fast. More effort than sending your slides off to be processed, but a lot more control over the quality of the final product. Highly recommended."
4,"I found this a ""hard-to-put-down"" book!","While it is no classic work of literature, White's story telling often touched my heart. Every story brought forth unexpected emotions, ranging from suspense and fright of wilderness experiences to the sadness of lost love. White writes about ""matters-of-the-heart"" issues which we all experience as part of our search for our own destiny.This is not just a collection of short stories, it is collection of the ""defining moments"" of White's journey in search of himself."
4,Clare Tourist,"While visiting the Clare, Michigan Cops and Doughnuts Bakery I came across this book and its' sequel at the doughnut shop. I read it all while enjoying our week in Michigan and the sequel on the way back to Illinois.I was laughing through some chapters and crying at the end of others. I did not want to put either book down. I originally bought the two books for my son who will do his police internship this next year through the university he attends in Illinois. He is also an avid fisherman.I have several regrets - 1. the copies were not autographed. 2. so far, there is not a 3rd book. 3. Mr. White was not at the Cops & Doughnuts Shop the day we stopped in for a doughnut and drink.(Yes, in the second book there are several misspelled words - though/through as an example. I would also think that the publishing company would have a better proofreader)"
1,Poor quality,"This DVD had real potential. As a member of the Armed Forces, I was hoping for something that would take me back to boot camp and give me the quality of workout I remember. Didn't happen. I'm not saying that the Navy SEALs don't have excellent training, what I am saying is that it is not reflected in this workout. The filming is done very poorly, on about $40/day. I thought I was getting a workout that would require no equipment, but that is not true. While the majority of the exercises don't require anything but you, there is a major section that needs pullup and dip bars. In retrospect, I would not have bought this DVD, but would have spent my money elsewhere. Don't waste yours like I wasted mine!"
3,DIP BAR NOT INCLUDED,The title description never mentions that a pull-up and dip bar are required for this workout. I got it mostly to remind me of PT cadence.
4,Great Guitar playing.,"There is only Bill playing the harmonica, the guitar, and foot stomp. If you haven't seen him perform, you will have trouble believing this. His singing voice is unusual and his style is close to Irish folk, but i think he will appeal to anyone who likes great guitar and folk music. He is On this recording, he reminds us of Greg Brown with a lot of Irish in his playing. Almost everything on the disk is his composition and that's good too."
4,Book is ok,"Most of the recipes actually have more than 3 ingredients but obviously recipes need more than 3 ingredients to taste like something, but the recipes are mostly tasty just wish they had pics in the book."
4,Pretty good,"For college physics, if you have the time to do all the probs, its a pretty good book. I noticed that its the same problems and explanations as the older version that is strangely more expensive...so...get at it guys...lol. But if you want really good, excellent, challenging, college level that will make you a master, I recommend Serway's physics problems to do, and...resnick,halliday's,and krane's physics book to learn from."
4,The Sound of the Future,"Neu! created the motorik beat and subsequently acted as the electronic and industrial influence upon many other experimental bands and albums, ranging from their own contemporaries Kraftwerk to Brian Eno to David Bowie's Low and Heroes to Joy Division to Radiohead. Neu! displayed unity in the ""song cycle"" of their debut, while their third and final album showcases their diversity. The strength of their swan song is that in going their separate ways Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger achieved the impossible: an album which captured both opposite sides of the '70s at their most minimalistic--ambient AND punk."
3,"Interesting, with 'name' musicians...","I picked this up because I am a huge fan of Billy Sheehan, however, I'm not too sure he plays on the whole CD. One song he definitely solos on, but it says additional bass by Wayne Garner on the package. I'm willing to bet Garner played on most of it. The same goes for Steve Howe- one solo on one tune.That aside, it is not too bad at all. If you dig Yes, then chances are good that you'll like it. This CD is also a must for John Petrucci fans. He solos all over the place. Some of the vocals are uneven, but James LaBrie does a great job on the parts he sings. (He stays within his range on this disc.)Obviously, this disc is relying on your curiousity. All those names on it are hard to pass up. Are they worth the sum of their parts? I'm not too sure."
2,"Obvious plugs, not reviews","I turn to these reviews to help me decide on a purchase. Unfortunately, in this case, the reviews are almost worthless because they are obvious plugs by the publisher, author or their friends. There are even two identical reviews back to back. This system needs some screening to make reviews of these types of products relevant and not self-serving hype."
3,glad I didn't pay book store price for it,"Just couldn't get into it. a lot of the information was good, but some very erroneous stuff too. Organic - is a waste of time. More important than organic is the pesticides and crap added to preserve our food. I suppose it's worth a read and look through - I saw nothing 'power aging' about it."
2,Power to age?,I found his system a bit to hard to follow. Maybe I should look at the book again. I am getting older fast!
1,The same ole' thing!,"I had heard alot of 'buzz"" about the book before it came out and was very excited and anxious to pick it up; anticipating learning something new that I could implement. I found that a significant amount of the text in this book overlapped or repeated information contained in other Null publications. The book touts that it gives you a step by step approach to anti-aging YET throughout the text I could not find one. Redundant and disappointing.."
1,after reading the reviews...........,"Since being a member of one of Gary's health support groups and following his program to the letter, I like to stay in touch with what is new. I read the reviews and decided to buy the book and judge for myself. Unfortunately, I didn't find anything new or different that I could use to update my current lifestyle....what is his definition of ""Power Aging"" anyway."
2,Did anyone at Amazon LOOK at this BEFORE putting it on sale?,"Read the other reviews -- they are spot on. Unfortunately, I bought it from my tv and didn't take the time to read the reviews. There are two completely different lectures and the show stops in the middle of the second one. This is a video of ""Science-UFO"" symposium -- two guys with powerpoint lectures standing behind podiums -- NOT something from the Discovery or History or PBS. Although the stuff was interesting (why I gave two stars), it's all hocus-pocus science (connecting dots that don't connect)and it wasn't what was expected and the fact that it ends in the middle of one of the lectures is outrageous."
1,Aweful,"This was the biggest waste of time and money. I need a refund. Horrible nonsense, I don't know why or how something like this would be on a rental site. Don't watch."
3,Final Justice: A Badge of Honor Novel,"I've been reading this book for a few days, now, and I'm getting more irritated as I get further into the book. Who talks like this? I can't believe the police do or for that matter, anyone does. I certainly don't. And I'm not inferring that the police are idiots, either. Matt Payne is chasing a guy fleeing the scene of a car crash and the guy is described as a young, tall, white male 15 times from page 229 to 231. And, Mother? Please! All in all, the story is good, but it could have been boiled down to a shorter book if you take out all the ridiculous language. Tell Griffin to get real!"
3,25 years later and nobody is a day older,"Not as good as Books 6 and 7.Big beef: The first 7 books all took place in the mid 1970s. Start reading Final Justice and all of the sudden everyone has laptops, cell phones and digital cameras. I don't think the year is established, but what is clear is that more than 25 years has elapsed, but NOBODY is any older. And I think the story could have been told in the 1970s."
3,30 year time warp?,"This is nothing special in the Badge of Honor series.The story line isn't particularly interesting or suspenseful and there is no character development.As usual, there are many repeated text passages from the preceding novels.30 year time warp?In the opening scene, 2 robbers walk into a restaurant and one of the workers takes out his cell phone.Cell phone?Up until now, this series has been set in the 1970's.Not any more!It's now set in the late 1990's with no explanation.The mayor has disappeared but all the other characters are the same age and positions they were 30 years ago.What's going on here?The main problem I have with this is that Griffin has always threaded his novels around actual historical events.When he's dealing with 1970's events that I'm not familiar with, they make for enjoyable reading. When he's dealing with events that got national attention 2 years ago, I already know what happened and the results.It makes his writing even more predictable than usual."
4,The Art of Camouflage,This video shows you step by step on how to make ghillie (sniper) suits. It Shows you how to conceal a rifle or a camera. It also tells you the crawling moves. Like Sniper low crawl and others. They tell you the supplies you need to make a ghille. Chance Doane
4,Good Enough,"Anacona was a pretty good book. It kept me reading and all that jazz but at times I felt it was sorta... lifeless. Almost as If it wasn't a real diary. I can totally understand because she's not a very well known person. I liked the story and stuff. Well, I think my main point is it's great but not as great as some of the other spectacular Royal Diaries. READ THEM ALL!"
5,Great collection,"Of course we all love the piano music and ""Peer Gynt Suite"" by Edvard Grieg, but here are also fifty very fine Lieder of his. I appreciate that this edition calls itself ""for low voice,"" and it really is! Some low-voice editions are pitched more in a middle register. Texts of the songs are in English and German only; I would have preferred to have the Norwegian also, but a person can look the Norwegian up, and it is true that few singers know to pronounce Norwegian anyway. This is a great book."
4,A good gift for my mother,"I bought this 3-pack CD soundtrack for my mother at christmas. She is a big fan of the TV series, so she was thrilled when she saw what i got for her.I'm not really into that music myself, but accordingly to my mother, the soundtrack is a great collection of those 68' hits from her youth. 75 classic good tracks for little money, is a good buy I would say..."
3,it's ok,"It's definitely not the best phone on the market, but it's never dropped a call yet. It's good as a phone and a camera, but that's it. It has horrible battery life so I'm luck to get a day out of it (I only use it about 3 times a day). I've completely given up on the mp3 function - the sound quality is horrible and it's too confusing (you need to be a certified genius to operate this thing). The speakerphone is bad too - the best I can describe it is, it souds like an out of rage radio station (alot of static and constantly breaking up).The camera on it is surprisingly good for a cell phone though. I went to a car show a little while ago and my digital camera died on me so I swithed over to my phone. After transferring the pictures to my computer, I was surprised to find that the pictures from this phone were the same quality as thos from my camera (kodak easyshare cx6230 in case your wondering).I wouldn't entirely reccomend this phone, but you could still do worse."
4,"Not perfect, but so far so good.","Pros: Excellent camera; Clear calls; Design and style; Lots of features; Decent music player; Excellent display quality; Good voice recognitionCons: Plays only WMA, not MP3; Some music files stored on the card don't show up in the playlist; Limited number of ring tones; Less than intuitive menus; Bluetooth works only for head set, not file transferI'm happy with it so far, but I've had it less than a week. I ordered an extended life battery because standard battery runs down too fast. It works great with my new bluetooth head set. I wish it would play MP3 files but it only plays WMA.Overall, it's a nice phone with tons of features. A lot of features that some people cry are lacking are actually there if you look in the right places, such as one-button silence mode (open phone and hold in on the volume down button for 2 seconds.)."
5,"Wide for my althletic calves, comfy compared to regular boots",wide in the forefoot which is great for my problematic wide womanly feet. they look great and fit nicely over my athletic calves. this will do well over jeans or with short sweater dresses. Nice rubbery sole won't make my feet suffer too much.
2,The boots tore up in a month!,"I do not like these boots. I have a job where I have to walk for 7 hours a night, and I needed a boot that would last. Well, these boots didn't even last a month. The bottom of the heel is already completely off of both boots. They also hurt my back and knees. Definitely not like walking on air. My advice... buy Clarks Diamond Glow. They work wonders for people on their feet all day!"
4,Nice combination of comfort & style--Great for slim calves,"This is the third pair of Aerosoles boots that I tried & the only ones I didn't have to return. The other 2 (Cardinal & With Love) were too wide in the calves. The shaft measurements given were not accurate. Lasticity are stated as being 14 inches around on Amazon, but stated as 10 inches around on the Aerosoles website. The size 9 is about 13 inches around, which is almost perfect for me especially if I wear thick tights. I like that these boots are dressy, but also comfortable & practical. The rubber sole has nice traction. The shaft has a cloth liner & the insole has moderate cushion. I debated on whether to get wide width, because some reviewers said these are narrow, but I went with regular width & they fit fine. They are not the most durable, though, so probably not a good outdoor or heavy use boot. The outer coating is thin & peeled around the ankles after repeated use. But overall these are good looking boots for around $50."
3,Received and Returned,"I ordered these boots and immediately sent them back. Too big and baggy on my skinny calves. Ironically enough I bought these boots cause I found a website that specifically recommended them for ""skinny calves"". I wore them around the house for a while. They seems comfy but were clearly very cheaply made. My quest for skinny calf boots continues... bummer."
3,Not as hot as I'd hoped indoors,"It's tough to get those poles together, as other buyers stated, but that's what makes it sturdy once it's done so that was fine w/ me. I got it for indoor use, hoping to warm up my indoor cacti. It's not airtight as it has soft sides and an open bottom so even in sun it hasn't gotten hot inside yet. It says it's for outdoor use which is probably best."
1,TNA SUCKS!,This has got to be one of the worst ppv of all time!Certanly a low point in tna at that time.
2,Foundations Textbook,"This book is an ok text on foundations. There are a lots of typos in the book. My professor has to constantly add corrections to the book. He calls the text sloppy. In every edition some mistakes are corrected and new ones appear. Would not recommend this book to anyone, instead look at some Federal Highway Publications and a soil mechanics book. That will be a lot more helpful."
4,Excelente texto como guia para un cursode pregrado,He tenido este texto como guia de mis cursos de cimentaciones en la universidad Nacional de Colombia y mis alumnos tienen en el el mejor texto guia sobre el tema .Lo utilizo desde 1994 y no le he encontrado sustituto
1,Broke after a month,"I was very disapointed in this watch, it stopped working about a month after I recieved it. I thought it was a dead battery, but it still did not work after I got a new battery."
2,SHALLOW PRETENDING TO BE DEEP,"I've read Castillo's ""So Far From God"" and was so charmed by it that I couldn't wait to read ""Sapogonia.""I had to double check myself and make sure that I, indeed, was reading the same author. ""Sapogonia's"" characters are so on-the-surface and stereotypical that even this gringa is waiting for more elucidation.Castillo tries to be too angry, while not giving me characters that draw me into their inner anger. All the anger is on the exterior in this book...leaving one thirsty for something more satisfying. And, while there's nothing wrong with experimenting, this book lacks true ingenuity."
2,Way too small,"When I purchased two of these (pale green and black) there was no review. As the other reviewer mentioned, these bags are way too small. My regular size yoga mat doesn't fit on the side of this bag. My green bag started tear apart on the side less than a month of very lightly used so I don't think these are quality bags. They look nice and that's all. They don't feel soft (rather rough) so unless you are wearing t-shirts, the shoulder straps and straps at the lower back will rip off the clothings. I also don't like the handle, which is very uncomfortable for the back of the neck (at least for me in the summer in DC). I paid ~$19 each of these bags but I am willing to pay more for quality backpacks, such as SwissGear by Wenger and amazon often offer with good price."
5,Moving and Memorable,"People tend to have enough to read, so I rarely foist new things on my friends to add to their pile. But I've made repeated exceptions for ZZ Packer since discovering the title story of this collection several years ago, which sent me scurrying to the library to find whatever else she had written. These emotionally complex and gutwrenching stories showcase a variety of African-American characters struggling to break free of their mental prisons, with realistically mixed results. Like Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, race is a context but ""on the lower frequencies"" (and not so lower ones) the characters speak for all of us. Plus the stories are simply good reads - events move fast and the tension rarely lets up until the finish.Friends of the extraordinary, give this book a read!"
5,Exciting stories,"Drinking Coffee Elsewhere is one of my personal favorites. Its exploration of the characters, fascinating plot and smooth flow make for an excellent read, which is why I recommend it to any lover of nice stories.With other collections like Usurper and other Stories, Ward no 6, I am I am enjoying short fiction for the first time in my life."
5,Water Pik Flosser,"I love the flosser, and I've finally got my husband to floss. He's bad about using normal floss, I think he is finally doing a good thing for his teeth."
3,Better than nothing!,"I am not a flosser...I don't do it nearly as much as dentists recommend. This gadget will give you more incentive to attempt daily flossing. Even if you don't floss everyday, you'll find you're tempted to do it more often with this device than with that dreadful string.Pros- Infrequent flossers may floss more. It's easier to maneuver than string floss. It's a Godsend to people with braces or other dental work.Cons- It is difficult, sometimes impossible, to get in between tightly spaced teeth...I can barely slide the thick tips down the sides of my front teeth. It is costly to keep replacing the tips.While it does not reach the many plaque prone areas between teeth that normal floss does, something is better than nothing. String flossers, stick with your string...flossing slackers, give this device a try."
1,Not worth the money..,"Don't waste you money on this, its useless, I tried it once, and i tossed it in the garbage."
3,Handy,"Handy and quick when you can't use regular floss, but it is not a substitute for string floss. It's a little difficult to maneuver to get the backside of your teeth."
1,Too good to be true.,"I was really hoping this would make flossing easier but honestly, it increased the amount of work involved and didn't do a good job. The back teeth are nearly inaccessible to the head because of it's angle. When I could get an angle, the plastic tip often buckled under the pressure and went down into the gums instead of through to the other side. There is just no way this is as good as plain old flossing."
1,CRAPPY,"Now I know why this product was only $6....because it works like crap.If you purchase this product it will be the worst choice you have made.It says ""waterpik"" but the only water you will be using it the water to wash the blood out of your mouth because of it puncturing your gums.I tried it once and will never use it again nor will I buy another WaterPik product because of this.If you like the feeling on something stabbing your gums and the taste of blood, you might like this product ,but otherwise there is no use for this product!!"
4,Underrated and Overembelished,"Its an obvious rip of ""Last House on The Left"".For what it is , I recommend it. I don't think it's as brutal as all the media has portrayed it to be.Kevin Gage, who was seen in Micheal Mann's ""Heat"",is excellently disgusting. Hope there's a sequal."
1,"Most boring ""chaos"" you can imagine","Chaos is a total waste of time and money. This movie is suppose to be the most graphic and brutal movie ever released and it does not come close. All you see is upper body shots and suppose to guess what is happening off screen. The character ""Chaos"" is suppose to be the face of evil and is portrayed as just a horny redneck. The performaces by the actors were lousy and not beliveable at all. The movie obviously tried to build a name by creating controversy when maybe they should directed their efforst to the movie instead of hyping it. Defintely skip it."
2,Carbon copy of the original Last House on the Left,"First off I'd like to say that I love Cult Films, Grindhouse Films from the 70's, Obscure Rare Horror, Revenge Movies, Euro-Trash, Asian Imports, Classic Drive-In Movies, Midnight Movies, etc. So this type of film is right up my alley. Yes, in the last 20 minutes or so of the film it does become a carbon copy of the original Last House on the Left BUT the filmmakers do throw in a twist ending. The film over all was brutal but not as brutal or well executed as [...]. Both far superior revenge films. The opening ""message"" seemed kind of silly as if the filmmakers were trying to justify the brutality they were about to subject you too. The torture did make me squirm at times but again, Hood Has Eyez knocks this out the box. Recommended for those who like rape/revenge films."
1,OMG,"Don't waste your money, it STINKS!!! Stallone's kid needs to hit the gym too. GOD THIS MOVIE WAS AWFUL, LOL!!"
1,One of THE WORST BOOKS I have ever read!,"We open on the story of three kids who sneak into nieghbors' pools to swim at night without permission. Sounds like a regular story- right? Then as in all bad kids at a secret pool stories- one of them almost drowns! Oh, no! How sad and depressing! This book is dreadful! Don't waste your time reading about skinny-dipping kids who get yelled at by a bunch of western singers in bright pink outfits!"
3,Repeat this mantra,"Inspiring but, in this case, thin material for an entire book, the importance of positive imagery is an element of health that may become more respected as the USA resigns itself to our need for affordable medicine.The author is a saintly prophet of visualization. But the book is repetitive, like a mantra... Maybe Naparsek has ODed on her own panacea!"
1,Really is obsolete,"Corel Ventura may have been a good program once upon a time, but it is unsuitable for long, complex documents that involve color and illustrations. Other programs offer more value, more features, more support, and will work on modern operating systems."
5,Nora Roberts - Key Trilogy,Very captivating reading!! I read the Key Triology and was literally hooked. It was after that I purchased the Three Sisters Triology and am currently reading The Circle Trilogy. Enjoyable is all I can say. Not your everyday romance. Written as only Nora Roberts can do.
1,Key Trilogy Box Set,"I never received the order.I actually forgot that I had ordered this item, but I did not receive it.I am sorry for the inconvenience about not letting you know.Martha Call"
4,quick fun read,"This is a great set if you want a classic Nora Roberts tale. I breezed through it in two days. Well worth the money, and a good story for anyone around fifteen and up. There is mythology and Wicca tone."
5,johnson leveling tripod,What a breeze it was to set up this tripod. I love the durablity of this tripod. The only downfall that this tripod has are the clasps on the chains that hold the legs together. I still give it a 5 star rating as that is such a small item to fix. I love how it raises and lowers. It's very simple to use and very efficient.
3,6-Ounce Squeeze Bottles,"The size of these is perfect for smaller quantities. The quality is average. Got them on time, but one of the tips had a hole in it and had to be returned. Which was done quickly. Thank you, Amazon."
5,fun hop rox my world,"well, when i was a kid, which wasn't too long ago, this thing took over. i loved it soooo much, that i've been looking for it ever since i first got to use one. now that i've found it, you bet i'm buying a few...if your kid (or adult, as in my case, ha...) likes more physical platy, this is the thing to get. my goodness...i looove them. later dayz, kiddzoz."
4,Good exercise ball and enjoyed by my kid,I am using this ball since last one month and happy with it mainly because of its capability to provide a good pleasure for kids
2,Smaller than expected,"Smaller than I expected it to be, it's hard to tell by the description just what to expect. Good for up to 4 years old, maximum."
1,Too small!,Size of product needs to be mentioned in ads. My daughter wanted a larger one as she had outgrown her small one. This was smaller than what she had and she couldn't understand why Santa wouldn't give her the right size?!Bummer!
3,Ball bounce & sport fun hopper,The bouncy ball is much too small for our 4- yr. old granddaughter. I wish it had been apparent when I ordered that there are many sizes and that I needed to order according to her size.
3,Too small,My small four year old loves hers but this was way too small for my nine year old I would recommend only for kids ages 2-4. Very small ball.
2,did not like prouduct....shipper was good,the ball bounce and sport fun hooper does not stay blown. i keep having to refill. not as i expected!
3,Way smaller than I thought,"When we put air in these on Xmas eve we were surprised to see how small they were. Would not recommend for kids 6+. (I have a 6 year old and an 8 year old). That said, they are made of heavy rubber and look like they will last for awhile."
3,It's ok,I remember having on as a kid and I enjoyed it. my kids played with it for a little while and that was it. Very durable.
2,Too small to be fun,"I guess my kids are larger than average (they are 3 and 6), but this was so small, they could not even use it. It is well enough made, however, so I will give it to GoodWill, and I am sure someone will get something out of it."
1,Has gotten too silly,"When I started watching this series, I enjoyed it. Now it is just plain silly. Nathan Fillion is acting way too silly for me. It is no longer realistic and many here won't agree with me, but that's how I feel. Too bad because it could have been better if he wasn't so darned silly acting in it."
5,Fabulous,Love the whole concept & enjoy the interaction that the cast have. really like the idea of the writers around the card table. Keep it going.
1,Horrible glitches and stoppage,From the start to the finnish it would pause and have to rechash ....dont waste your money!!! Needs major improvment
3,Not as good as previous seasons but still enjoyable,"We loved season 1 and season 2 while season 3 was good but at times got silly. This season is similar to season 3. Some episodes are very good, some are fun but silly. Still good, still recommend it but with a little hesitation."
5,Best show on TV,"I purchased this for my wife for Christmas this year. My wife got me hooked on this TV show. The more you watch it the more you want to see. It it a very good show that gives you comedy, drama and suspense every time. I can't wait to see what they will do on the next show and yes I did purchase seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4."
4,Really helps shed water weight,Talk about instant skinny!PEOPLE not to be used as a weightloss supplement. Use safely and wisely and drink lots of fluids while taking. I found it worked great during those PMS water bloat days...amazing!
2,Not suitable for a shower,I have recently bought this item thru Amazon.I have installed it in a shower to catch hair which blocks the drain.The item is unfortunately not very robust and the suction cups do not hold it very firmly in position with the effect that it is easily disturbed and then moves away from the drain outlet.
2,Too small for shower drain.,This is nice idea and would work for a small shower drain hole but NOT for regular sized shower drains. The suction cups do not cover so that you can keep it down. A larger size would be better.
5,BEST Drain Protector EVER!!!,"I lose so much hair in the shower that I should either be bald or my shower drain should be irreparable. Thanks to this little bit of plastic magic (and good genes), neither is true. I have purchased four other drain protectors and none work. Two were metal but the holes were so small that they only worked for a little while and then they started getting clogged. The other two were plastic like this one but never stayed in place. This drain protector has cool little suction cups that hold it in place and large slits that trap hair really well but don't clog at the same time. I have been using this little wonder for well over a month now and my shower drain is still running clear."
2,Kitchen Drain,Item works well for kitchen sink drains only. The picture of the item is deceiving - it is to small for a shower drain.
1,Clog protector,"Does not stop hair from slipping down the drain, but does make a great toy for a toddler!"
1,Don't believe those 5 star reviews.,"This product is too small, worthless, and expensive. At $20, they are trying to steal your money. The hair just slip underneath and the suction won't hold. If you have a small drain, it might work."
3,Uneven Comedy,"This is quite an off-beat comedy. It has some very enjoyable, very funny moments. But, on the other hand, there are also some very grating, very unpleasant moments as well. JoBeth Williams turns in an excellent performance as the schizophrenic neighbor of scripwriter George Segal, and she is definitely the high point of the film. The ending was unsatisfying, and to some exent, so was the film."
2,Bootleg...doesn't benefit TG...,"From Brainwashed's website:Studio recordings allegedly from 1975 (but most likely between 1975-1977),: Peter Christopherson is not credited. He was most likely a participant,: and the credits are falsified.Is it worth it to pay an outrageous price for a used copy of this cd? Save your hundred bucks and buy the boxed set live cd's instead, Mute record's website (US and UK) carries a lot of TG's back catalogue, go buy it from Mute's website for a much better deal."
1,new ecw or wwecw,"if you like the new wwecw and want thoese macthes on dvd then this is for you but if you want best of ecw vol 2 you are out of lucki know others have allready said this but know i am to i tried not to but know i final have to ecw is gone and wwe has taken its placethank you paul,rvd,sabu,mick,dreamer,sandman,franchice,spike and the duddleys,jt smith,tanka,raven,bwo,candino,pe,pit bulls,fbi,tajire,supper crazie,the elimenters,jerry lynn,lance storme and every else thank you all rip ecw long live tna and roh"
1,Behind the times,"This is fine for old hands who refuse to try anything else.If you are new to Desktop design, look elsewhere - this program was last updated in 2002, and there are no upgrade routes, no support from Corel, and no third party how-to books. Search Amazon.com to see how many books about Corel Ventura 10 are out there.The information promoting this program is nearly a decade out of date - it does not support the newer versions of the programs listed, and those programs it once outperformed have advanced far beyond Ventura's limited scope of basic page layout, and several of the features advertised - including .pdf export - are poorly implemented. Worse, most printers are not familiar with the nuances of this program.Selling it like a 'new' program is akin to selling Windows 95 as a cutting edge operating system. Great for its time, but now hopelessly outclassed."
3,Interesting but complex,"Very interesting book but extremely easy to get lost. The ideas put forward are complex and much re-reading is required to comprehend the author's viewpoint. Still, an interesting and alternative view - why not give it a try?"
2,Don't just hand this to your child,"This would be a great book for learning about Catholic life and pilgrimages during that time period if it wasn't so PC. About 70% of the book is accurate, 25% is fluff and 5% contains the usual inaccuracies and misconceptions about the Catholic Church. There are about 20 or 30 sentences that do one of the following-poke fun at Christian beliefs-misconceptions about the Catholic Church-portray Moslims as more enlightened and more intelligent-references to s-e-x (about 3 sentences)-other politically correct viewsThis book does not twist historical people to act like modern people as does Catherine Called Birdie, for example, but there are enough problems that I won't be having my younger set read it and the older teens aren't interested. To bad she didn't do just a bit more research on the time period or perhaps she does and just couldn't resist bringing her own biased views to the story."
2,Don't bother,"The couple of fun things about this book, assassin-style chases and Bruce Banner on the run, still don't make it worth the time. The cliched comic characters of the team hunting down Bruce hit you like a thrown tank to the head and then you have to wade into a ridiculous plot. There's a lot of fun and good Hulk books out there. This isn't one of them."
5,A Must Read for Health Professionals and Persons suffering from Insomnia,"This new book addresses the growing Insomnia epidemic facing Western cultures. Our 24/7 society encourages less sleep and more work, for all ages. The Insomnia Answer is well written and creatively addresses the many variations of sleeplessness. The authors offer detailed behavioral treatment techniques that can be used effectively, step by step.Health professionals will no doubt rely on this book for helping their patients and will prescribe the: Insomnia Answer as the first line treatment, rather than immediately writing a prescription for medication."
4,$10 more than other sellers,I guess there are really not much to rate a belt other than price and material.Price : some sites are selling for $19.99 so shop around.Material : rather soft n comfy after all the duration of the weighted dip exercise will only last no more than a minute. While one reader comments that the length of the chain is not longer enough if 3 or 4 - 45 lbs or 25 kg - plates are chained up. But again a nylon belt is not meant for heavy dipping as the sides of the belt are not sturdy enough n will fold up and that will not be comfortable. Pay more and get a leather dip belt instead.
5,Great double trigger,"Worth every penny. Though you can't get a walk going, that is the fault of the A5 itself, with it's high trigger pull. Using both fingers at once you can really get your money's worth with the cyclone feeder and get a lot more paint downrange than with a single trigger. Having that extra leverage really lets you get on the trigger, I'd recommend this to anyone looking to fire faster with the A5. The included trigger guard is just as sturdy as the stock guard."
4,Good replacement part,"I was very pleased to find this item on Amazon. An electrical malfunction caused my original fan to run constantly and burn out, so I needed a replacement quickly because it was summer in Texas. This item fit well and runs more quietly than the original. I wish that the receptacles for the hood propper-upper bar were better, because they don't hold the receiver brackets well at all, but the fan does the job, so far."
3,Science Fiction or Fantasy?,"I read Lebbon's Berserk. Hated the story but I liked his writing enough that when I saw this on the rack I decided to give him another chance.He is an excellent writer and knows how to tell a story. This is definitely an adult fantasy. The world he constructs is indeed dark and grim. Even the ""good guys"" are hard to like. One thing I didn't like at all was the introduction of ""machines"" into the story. Sorry, but I am a purest. I like my fantasy to be fantasy and my science fiction to be science fiction. I don't like to see my magic and science mixed. I also found the back story to be somewhat confusing and had difficulty sorting out the Red Monks versus the Mages versus the Noreelans versus the heroes. Also be warned that this is the first in a series since this book ends abruptly without any resolution. The central characters are left hanging in midair, literally."
5,"Excellent, dependable product","I had a smaller Cuisinart food processor that I received for my wedding 11 years ago and then lost a vital part. I replaced it with this larger size and am thrilled. It is easy to use, easy to clean and indispensible if you love to cook and need to cook efficiently -- a huge time saver!"
5,Love Schaums,"Even though this did not perfectly follow along with my college book for Signals and Systems, they paperback was very helpful to help me with the course. There are lots of problems to work in the paperback and also gives you step by step instructions on how they were solve. The material is easy to read and understand."
3,Feminine feel.,"I love much of Jonn Serrie's music, but Xlandia is not among my favorite Serrie releases. The first couple of tracks are mildly flavorfull, but the rest of the cd just doesn't fly off the ground much with its pastel dominated feel. In fact, I just can't help but say that this is just a rather boring cd. I am very much into relaxing, soft music, but Xlandia just doesn't appeal to me."
1,False Advertising,"There were many problems with my order with Favor by Serendipity. I ordered 2 engraved business card holders. One holder was difficult to open, while the other would not close at all. The so-called leather is not genuine leather; the overall craftmanship is shabby; and the engraving looks unprofessional.When I called them, I was told that I could not even get a full refund, since they were engraved. Needless to say, I was not happy with either the product or the customer service. Hopefully, I can prevent someone else from having the same unfortunate experience I had."
4,lots of fun,"I bought this last year to pull behind my jet ski for the lake.Me and my friends had a ball on this thing, it was so much fun!! The material is heavy duty and can stand a lot of weight,we had 3 grown women on this.The only thing I didnt like was its hard to get back on in the water, we had to climb on the jet ski to get back on the hot dog,other than that We love this thing and cant wait to use it again"
1,Not all it's cracked up to be!,Does not swivel on bucket seats that are not flat and it is also hard to keep it away from the back of the seat to allow for easy swiveling. I returned the product.
