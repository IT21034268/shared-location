2,boring,"I found this book to be long, unexciting, boring at times, I only finished it because I bought it also in hopes it would get better"
3,not as good as her others,"I very much enjoyed the characters in this book, as I do in all of Anne Tyler's work, but it lacked something. It was kind of flat and disappointing, especially the end. Had Delia gone to all this trouble for nothing? I almost felt let down, since SAINT MAYBE and THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST were such brilliant masterpieces."
4,Amazing read!,"Since reading Tyler's fabulous SAINT MAYBE, I have started to write her other novels. This is one, while not as brilliant as SAINT MAYBE, is satisfying and quite entertaining. Admittedly the ending leaves much to be desired, but Delia's story is marvelously told, and the characters are all richly drawn out. I just think this is a fabulous book."
1,Total waste of time i hated this novel,"I would prefer to give this book 0 stars but it won't let me. The story seems to start off well enough but it goes downhill from there to the point i wanted to quit reading the book after about page 50. Do you really know any REAL women that can walk away for over a year and not want to visit or call or see their children? Depressing to say the least, i wish i had back the hours i spent reading this corny romance. Yes i read the whole book all the way through and it left me wishing i hadn't."
3,Starting over,Ladder of years is a unique mystery. The main character Delia Grinstead walks off and leaves her family while on their annual family vacation. Befor this vacation delia realized that her husband may have married her for all the wrong reasons. She also felt that she was useless to her almost grown childeren. For years Delia made it her buisness to please everyone other than herself. Now it was time for Delia. After leaving her family Delia started a new life for herself in a small town. At some point everyone feels the need to start over. Delia explores this fantacy for you.Ladder of years took several unexpected turns. I thought her husband would come find her and profess his love to her. Instead for a year and a half with little contact her family decided to give Delia her space. I enjoyed the book as a whole. I was a little disappointed with the end.
3,Not Anne Tyler's best--by a long shot,"I DID like this book but contrary to what I've heard it is not her best. The resolution comes way too quickly and the reader really doesn't understand why Delia makes the choice she does. We also lose a few characters along the way--the author just stops mentioning them--and that is odd behavior for the main character. If you've read all of Ann Tyler go ahead and get this one too; you won't be disappointed, necessarily. But if this will be your first Tyler, or if you're hoping for a new favorite book of all time: Buyer Beware. ""Homesick Restaurant"" is the better choice."
3,Finding Yourself,"Anne Tyler displays an excellent portrait of a woman who has lost her own identity. Delia, a woman in her forties, knows herself only has a wife, daughter, mother and a sister and becomes unhappy when she realizes her identity is only through others. In her confusion she just walks away from it all. She moves to a new town, makes new friends and begins a whole new life. Except, her new life is exactly like the old one. Proving you are what you are through the choices you make. I really liked this book. It gave wonderful insights on life, self-worth, and relationships. However, I feel deprived not knowing what ever happened to Noah, Nat and Joel."
2,Boring,"I had high expectations for this book, based on the reviews printed on the first few pages. I was very disappointed. I disliked the style of writing and found the storyline to be both contrived and excessively drawn out. I didn't particularly like Delia, the main character, and none of the other characters were developed enough for me to really get a feel of what they were like. I thought this book would never end and when it did, I found myself left with nothing more than I had had when I started reading it."
4,A good book to think of myself,"Annie Tyler's ""Ladder of Years"" let me put myself into the book. It provides a platform for me to ask myself who I am and what should I do.The express is straightforward. Delia Grinstead, main character, tried to figure out what her identity is. She tried to change her dress and her manner. What's more, she changed her role from a wife and a 3-child mother to a secretary working in another place. While reading the book, I asked myself, ""Am I satisfied with present life?"", ""What can I do if I want to make life better?"", ""Do I need do the same as Delia did?"" At the end of the novel, Delia found her identity, but I still cannot find mine.Nevertheless, the book let me think my situation further, and hopefully, I can find my identity at last."
4,Taking a Trip Through Time,"Delia Grinstead never had much experience in life. She went from ""her father's house to her husband's house"" (actually, the same house!), without pursuing an independant life; even her secreterial work was connected to her father's/husband's medical practice. Delia decides to live her life over again, first by pursuing a man who reminds her of her only teenage boyfriend, then by travelling to a town that at first glace seems to be preserved from the early twentieth century. As her personal life proceeds, so does the ""age"" of the town and her various attempts at change, moving forward from an idealic past to a flawed present and future. Delia is forced to take notice of the true nature of her life."
2,Lacked Something,"It has been difficult for me to even decide if I enjoyed Ladder of Years. Yes, I kept turning the pages to see what would happen next, but that was the only reason I kept turning the pages. I felt that the book lacked something that I still cannot put my finger on. It is not the best book I've ever read, but not the worst. I could not fully figure out what Delia's intentions were for leaving her family, so I was never able to figure out if I personally could excuse her actions. I feel that Ms. Tyler could have gave the main character more emotional depth and not kept the reader guessing."
2,"Well-written, but inplausible","As both a mother and a daughter I could not 'buy' this story line. Like the character I went from my parents house to my husbands house, but I could not identify with her leaving the way she did. As a mother I couldn't imagine my kids letting me go without a fight. As a daughter there is no way I would have NOT put up a fight to get my mother back if she walked away like that. I had no sympathy or understanding for any of the characters."
3,"""So-So""","""Ladder of Years was not a novel that was particularly striking, nor did I find it boring. The idea of a wife and mother who up and leaves her husband and children is intrigueing becuse it happens so rarely. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I enjoyed the blurry explanation for Delia's actions. I felt that Tyler was leaving something for the reader to infer. Like many others, I enjoyed Tyler's casual style. Her writing flows nicely, and she creates characters that one can love and hate at the same time. Her characters are similar to real people and not romanticized in any way."
2,Disappointed,"When beginning Ladder of Years I was expecting an exciting and interesting story, but that was not what I ended up with. I really liked the beginning of the book but then there was no action. It seemed to drag on with little storyline. I was expecting that Delia would do something exciting or adventerous, but she never really did. I was disappointed with how little her character actually did while she was away. I don't think she was a changed person after leaving. I can relate to her actions and feelings but I don't think she accomplished anything while away. It was to easy for her to fit back into the same role as before. I would have liked to see the story end differently, perhaps more action from Sam. However I really did like the many metaphors throughout the story. I am able to appreciate the story for that but I did not find it to have enough action and to much detail that dragged on for to long."
2,Female empowerment? I don't think so!,"Anne Tyler's Ladder of Years started out with good intentions. I feel that they were lost somewhere along the way. At the end, those intentions were totally out the window. I was given the impression that the character, Delia, was going to be a strong female role model. She was someone who left her unhappy life in pursuit of her own happiness. And I was proud of her when she did eventually leave, though I would have liked her to be more exciting about it! But my pride went away quickly when I realized how wishy-washy she turned out to be. The ending to the novel left a lot to be desired. Much as Jackie from WI stated in a previous post, the ending just left me kind of baffled. What I thought was going to be a good example of a strong female character just ended up being a good example of what a strong female character ISN'T."
2,Anachronistic Mess,"As standard chick-lit/beach read, one baby step above romance novels, this book is okay. But I spent most of the book trying to figure out when it was set. The descriptions of clothing ranged from 1960's to 1980's, but suddenly there was a desktop printer and CD's. Superficial complaint? Maybe, but over-long descriptions of clothing and decor are a classic element of the genre, and I couldn't get a clear mental picture at all."
3,Classic Tyler,"Artfully crafted without artifice, and an especially moving depiction of how it is to want to disappear in order to know that it can be done, and can be survived. Perhaps a million married family-women have imagined it so."
2,A bit thin,"Ladder of Years was my first experience with Anne Tyler. I was only mildly impressed, because I thought the development of the plot was a bit thin. The book incorporated many real-life situations and emotions, but Tyler was too vague in her descriptions. Tyler left too much to the reader's imagination, which made it a bit difficult to really connect with the characters. It was a constant guessing game throughout the book as too what Delia was really feeling. It was almost impossible because of lack of description to decipher the real reason for Delia leaving, and whether or not she was justifiable in doing so."
1,A mystery...how poor writers get recognition as authors!,"Anne Tyler is so much lauded as a wonderful author...well, it just beats me how that has happened. A occasional good turn of a phrase does not make a great author! Ladder of Years...this plot is weak, the characterizations shallow, the ending implausible, the dialogue tedious. I only finished reading it because it was an assignment for our book club. All this business about Tyler writing about a slice of life... it isn't a slice of anybody's life I could imagine. Could Delia really walk back in from her 18-month totally selfish disregard of her family and they would act like she was just returning from a weekend out of town? Only in a novel in which the author is too lazy to do any real writing."
4,I Am Confused,"What is Delia going to do about Noah and Joel? The book just ended! What a horrible ending to an otherwise great book. I would have given it a ten, except for the ending?Any insights on what was supposed to happen to all those people Delia was involved with in her new life?"
5,Courtney Pines Back in the Day,"Nice mix of Traditional and modern, track 1 is really great with the dub of the old style kungfu dialog mixed in."
3,Robin Return To Batcave,"Burt Ward book looks into the real world of the pressures of his Caped Image.The stories are enough to make you realize the change and how insecure he was, and as a bit actor he was so influenced by the media frenzy at the time and his relationships and friendships that developed was a exibition of his training as a child performer.Growing up and taking charge later in life to rescue animals that were hurt and neglected shows that his feelings in the book are to be taken as a learning experience in life."
2,"Holy Moly, Somebody Put His Bat Back In The Cave!","After reading the first few pages of this book, it seemed like it was going to be an inspirational story of Burt Ward's struggle to success in one of the most beloved TV comedies of all time. Instead, I was brought into a somewhat funny (if not exaggerated) tell-all. At times it was charming, funny, and clever (for example, the stories about his first wife, apperances at schools, and one heck of a chapter on Julie Newmar) ...but in other moments it would go into sleazy, trashy, and VERY over-exaggerated nonsense (referring to yourself as a mock 'Super Stud Porn King' leaves a bad taste in anyones mouth).Buy it if you are a die hard Batman fan, or if you didn't grow up on the show...but if your only memories are of good natured fun on a clever TV show...read Adam West's ""Back To The Batcave""."
1,Hohner Echo Harmonica,This harmonica takes a lot of air. I have several and my favorit is the Hohner Chromonica 280 C
4,European Release of Unrare (but still great) Jonathan,"I know the music is great, but there isn't anything new except a different picture of Jonathan & pictures of the singles for ""Roadrunner Once"" & ""Buzz Buzz Buzz"". All the music you can get on ""Modern Lovers"", ""Jonathan Richman & the Modern Lovers""(which actually hasn't been available on cd the ten years I've looked), ""Rock & Roll With the Modern Lovers"", ""Modern Lovers Live"", & ""Back In Your Life"", or other compilations.I do like the middle period Jonathan, where He wrote some great songs like ""Martian Martians"" which teaches kids about tolerance, & ""My Love Is A Flower Just Beginning To Bloom"" about self esteem. These albums do get overlooked by critics who are focussed on ""Modern Lovers"" & how great it is. There are, however, better compilations for them, & great songs like ""Important In Your Life"" & the original ""Affection"" are left off this one. So the 4 stars is just cause I'm a crank who wants record companies to do everything I want."
1,a dissappointment from a genius,this is a terrible album for the great summers. I own most all of his solo stuff post-police and this was a huge let down.
2,Average Album Disappoints Pierce Fan,"I've been a fan of Pierce's since his Spacemen 3 days and this has to be his most mediocre output thus far. While it contains a few wonderful tunes, the majority of the album is mediocre and downright poor in some places. Given his work in the past, Pierce is capable of far better output than the work on this album. If you want to become acquainted with Spiritualized, skip this album and buy Lazer Guided Melodies. Then,at a later date, buy this album for the 2 or 3 wonderful songs on it. Otherwise, pass on to greener pastures."
3,let's try to be fair,"there are more beautiful records out there (anything by My Bloody Valentine, Cocteau Twins, The Black Watch, Slowdive) but the sheer majesty if not audacity of the arrangements and the feel, as it were, of this record makes it worth auditioning a number of times. Spacemen 3 were utterly transcendental, utterly mindblowing. immense bands fade, splinter groups never equal their sources, and everyone has his own opinion: buy this or borrow it, but you still do need to hear it. let's try to be fair."
1,Ouch!,"This album comes about as close to representing the feeling of floating in space as a punch in the arm. Annoying, overproduced garbage."
2,Disappointed,"I had read glowing reviews of this book and expected more than I got when I read it myself. Disappointment is often a function of expectations and reality being out of synch and I think that was the source for me here. It's not that it's a bad book, but I didn't get the DEPTH of information I was expecting. After going through the design and build process a couple of times, I felt as thought I already knew what was broadly covered in this book. Also, I was disappointed in the photo layouts. Like another reviewer here, I found the spaces to be pretty impractical for living in."
4,I thought this product worked very well. I ...,I thought this product worked very well. I noticed when I was taking it that my mood was better than usual. It seemed to work a little better than other similar products that I've tried. I think I'll continue to use this product and would recommend it to friends and family.
3,Not really for the Nikon S8000,"This is a great product; however, for my Nikon S8000 that has the tripod attachment slot on the right side rather than on the middle of the camera makes using this tripod difficult. With the Nikon S8000 I spend so much time adjusting the tripod and it still just flops down/ unable to hold it up because the weight is unbalanced. On my Easy Share Kodak camera where the tripod slot is in the middle of the camera this tripod works great. My Kodak camera is actually a heavier/bulkier camera than the Nikon, but the placement of the tripod slot makes all the difference. Not sure why Nikon placed the slot on the end of the camera."
2,Item does NOT support a digital camera,"I ordered the smaller tripod thinking it would be good for travel, but it is so small that it cannot hold my camera (which is a Canon ELPH SD model) in positions unless it is exactly centered and upright because the knobs rotate. That is not what the images and product in general is supposed to do. I am very unhappy, and now have to pay more to get a larger tripod."
5,Wonderful tripod!,"Now that my cameras have image stabilization, I find that I rarely need a tripod. It takes up space and can be a hassle to carry. These gorilla pods are wonderful. They weigh next to nothing, are flexible enough to conform to various terrain, or even to wrap around things (e.g. poles, furniture). Do make sure you get the right size tripod, though. The smaller ones are designed to support only point and shoots, and will sag/collapse when attached to a typical dSLR."
4,Small Gorillapod,I use mine with my Go-pro cam. Works well. Not built for heavy duty work but it pulls it off ok..
4,Versitile.,It hooks onto just about anything or sits on a desk nicely.The only change would be- I wish it held just a little tighter though.
4,Gorillapod Flexible Tripod,"I like the concept of this product and in general, this product is good. However...the only problem I have with it, and it's an important one, is the weight of the camera didn't seem to be factored into the design. I have a little Canon PowerShot A470 that screws onto the tripod just like all the other cameras would. This camera is not heavy or big, it's a little guy from Wal Mart, so it shouldn't slump over on the tripod. I find myself having to find something to prop the camera on when using the tripod in any position other than on a flat surface."
5,Great Little Tripod!!,"I took this compact tripod on vacation, not having tried it out at home. In fact, I hadn't even taken it out of the box, but when I did put it to use, it worked perfectly! I attached it to a camp chair and got took some group shots, you know the kind....where someone else always has to take the shot for you? I used it with my Panasonic Lumix 10X which is on the heavier side for a compact digital camera. Also, the area where you screw the tripod onto the camera, is off center so I was concerned that it Joby might not support the weight of my camera. I was pleasantly surprised that it worked just fine. The pictures turned out great. I would definitely recommend this handy little tripod!!"
4,Good for small jobs,Got this for spur of the moment shots. A little to small for certain styles of shooting. But overall it functions how it should. Can attach to almost anything and that is its greatest function.
1,Piece of CRAP!,"The ad picture and description for this item is a Joby GorillaPod Flexible Tripod. That is not what I received. I received a piece of junk, cheap knock-off that is clearly made of inferior materials. The item I received did not say ""Joby"" anywhere on it. The packaging did not say ""Joby"" anywhere on it. I have a Kodak C513 camera. This piece of junk would not hold my camera. It fell over every time and the one time I kept if from falling over, the section that the camera fastens to slowly slid to one side or the other and would never keep the camera in a position to take a picture. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
3,compact tripod,compact tripod but requires a lot of twisting and wraping to hold onto a pole or tree branch as it shows in images. Does work well as a standing tripod though.
4,Joby GP1- D1EN Gorillapod,"This tripod is great and an excellent fit for the FlipUltra HD, 3rd Gen! No more standing there with a camera in your hand."
5,Wonderful!,Words can not say enough about this awesome little gift! This tripod allows you to take a picture anywhere there is not a flat surface!Would buy again for myself or someone else!
5,Great practical tripod!,"When I was able to wrap this mini-tripod in a fence and take pictures of friends playing tennis, I was sold! Durable, many practical uses and affordable - a must buy."
3,Ok for small cameras only,"I guess my expectations were too high, but this tripod is way to weak to hold anything beyond the little point and shoot cameras. I wish they would have made that more clear up front so I wouldn't have wasted my time on this. I give it 3 stars instead of 2 because I guess if you need a small tripod for small cameras it will just fine."
3,Not as useful as I thought it would be,"Maybe I'm just not creative, but there are considerably fewer situations where the wrappable legs come in handy than I thought there would be. Most of the time I just end up using it as a normal tripod, where it is harder to make level than a traditional one. The legs seem to be pretty strong and don't move unless you want them to. I've used it on a Canon A630 and I think that is about the heaviest camera I would want to use it on, as well as a Canon S95 which is a perfect fit. The removable clips are a nice touch though I have to unscrew them anyway when putting my camera in its case. I would probably get something else if I had a do over, but I've had it for two years and haven't had a need to replace it."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,Wanted to use this for my Samsung Galaxy S2 but the joint right below the tripod head is so week it doesn't support anything more than a couple of ounces. Can only take photos in a landscape orientation it can't support my phone in a portrait orientation. Complete waste of money!!!
3,Not what I expected,This seems like a great item for a smaller or lighter camera. I mounts into my Nikon D5000 but wont support the weight well. I assumed from Pics and Reviews it might but it really doesnt.
5,Great at doing what I need.,"This little guy is handy to carry around on just about any trip with the camera. It worked well to steady my camera for night shots and always gave me a place to stand my little guy for selftimer group shots. Plus, it's easy to use. This is going on every trip."
4,"Great product, but beware if you have a Canon Powershot S60","Just wanted to make sure you were aware if you have a S60 or camera with similar offset tripod mount (it's way off to the side on the S60), this smallest Gorillapod will not support it adequately. I had to return this and get the larger model (for SLR cameras). That model works fine with the camera. Despite this, a great product overall."
4,For right now..,"It seems pretty good. I bought this from Brandsmart when it was on sale, and it works really well. I have a Samsung camera which looks like its heavier on one side (the design) and without the batteries, it holds the camera up steadily and solidly. It takes a minute or so to get it to stand without tipping over, but that is because each joint is adjustable. Once you figure that out, its a cake walk. Haven't put it to the test yet, but I have high hopes for it."
1,Would nit hold my canon powershot,"The tripod would not hold my canon powershot s50, what good is it? Need an extremely lightweight camera for this tripod to work."
1,Flimsy,Does not hold a point and shoot worth a darn. Save your money. I would buy something else if I were you.
1,Flimsy!,"I purchased this tripod for my Nikon 4500 digital which is a fairly compact camera, and should be right for this tripod. I found however that it would not support this camera, and legs would unravel, and the head sagged. The little Vanguard flex tripod is MUCH better for the same camera, and for far less money. My Canon S3 is a bigger, but still not an SLR by any means, and it simply can't be used with this tripod. I did try this with a SLR model I borrowed with equally disappointing results.If you have a VERY small light camera with 3x zoom or less this may work. Otherwise I'd recommend buying one size larger than they recommend, except that gets very pricey very quickly. There are better and less expensive options available."
5,Love it,"I have been looking for one of these but refused to pay over $20 for it, scored this one for $12 becuase it was black & grey. All the one with color were more expensive....who cares they all work the same!!"
4,Great gift,"My husband received this from our son and loved it. However, when we went to order it for our friend, we were unaware of the different sizes that this comes in....The one we got was larger than this one, and much more useful than this smaller one. I wish there was some way to make the consumer aware that there are the two distinctly different sizes.It's a great gift, however, I wish I would have had the additional information.The service was great and delivery excellent."
2,don't wanna loose my camera,"maybe if I had gotten the bigger ""gorrilapod"", it would hold my camera better. But this one felt very unstable, sliding off everything, bending unpredictably. I ended up returning it and getting the ""real thing"" a little tripod that can be extended up to 5 feet high and fits into my bag."
5,"Great, creative tripod for digital cameras","This product caught my eye one day when I was looking for tripods on Amazon, and with iti's great customer review record, decided to give it a shot.I use a Canon SD550 and it's a perfect tripod. It's size is just right for my point-and-shoot camera and it goes above and beyond what the typical mini tripod can do. Bravo to you, Joby. Or whoever makes these.Well worth the price."
4,Good purchase,"My camcorder was a little wobblier than I would've liked but my pocket camera worked great! I think the camcorder is too heavy for this tripod. Still, it stabilized my pan and zoom shots and worked great for self-portraits.If you're a professional photographer with a big backpack full of lenses and whatnot, you'll want something more solid. This one is light, it fits in my camcorder bag, and it helped us take nice snapshots of ourselves."
5,Excellent Device,"I purchased the Gorillapod GP1 for a Panasonic Lumix TZ1. Even though the TZ1 is near the max suggested weight it works fine.I often just use it to steady my camera against a wall or sign. I've also leaned my bike against a tree and mounted it on the wheel. I grips well and takes no space in a backpack.My only fear is the little mount connector may come loose from my camera and get lost, making the device unusable so for the most part I leave it connected to the Gorillapod."
4,gorilla pod,bought two of them for my kids (adults) this gadget makes it easy to get photos of a group without leaving someone out of the picture. It was very easy and fun to use. They love it!
3,Perfect for a small point and shoot camera.,"This tripod is very compact and light weight. It works well with a point and shoot camera. However, I hoped to use it with my DSLR camera too and the camera is too heavy. The tripod will not stay in position under the weight of a DSLR. I also hoped the legs of the tripod would have been longer. They are only 5"" long and that makes it tough to ""grab"" larger objects. Maybe I didn't read the product description thoroughly enough to know what I was really buying."
2,Great Pico Projector Tripod,"I bought this as a tripod for my pico projector and it works great. The tensioner on the mount could be better and I doubt it would function for a SLR, but a smartphone or point and shoot camera would be fine using this mount.Edit: I'm downgrading my rating to two stars. Even with a light pico projector, the tensioner wears out fast and the tripod becomes pretty useless with a few uses."
5,Gorilla MiniPod is A Handy Versitile Pocket Pod,"I just love the Joby GP1-01EN Gorillapod Flexible Tripod because of its tight gripping design. Just twist it to any shape needed to hold your camera and have fun! I highly recommend buying this product. I also plan on buying the larger model also. LF - Kalamazoo, MI"
2,GorillaPod,It's some what clumsy and fidgety and hard to adjust. However it's better than nothing when you need a tabletop tripod.
3,Not wonderfully stable,"For the price, it is a good basic tri-pod; but it isn't as stable as I would like for taking outside photos."
5,Great gift!,"This tripod made a great gift! It's extremely flexible, allowing you to stabilize the tripod in almost any position; and the rubber gripping keeps it from sliding down lamp poles, etc. It's also very lightweight, which allows you to take it anywhere. For example, the very first time we used it was to take a group skiing picture by placing the tripod on a ski slope! The pic came out great :)"
1,electro twister sux don't buy it.,"i bought one from amazon. 2 days after installing it it stopped working. part of it had melted and not from an outside source but from within. Talismoon replaced this for me saying ""we've never heard of that happening before. send us pictures."" the replacement melted in 4 days and caused my xbox 360 to short circuit. i am not going to get a third.you can see it on you-tube as well."
2,Not what I was hoping for.,I live in a very rural area and most of these recipies seemed to go in a kitchen that was in an area that had access to fresh spices and herbs (and some ingredients I've never seen/heard of).I have no opinion of the recipies or the instructions provided because there literally wasn't one dish I could prepare using this book.
2,"All form, very little function. Greenwashing at its best.","While there are a few inspired designs, most of the products in this book are given the ""eco"" label because of some trivial afterthought. There is a thick line between ""ecologically sound"" and ""greenwashed,"" but no one seems to have told the editor. Good design is about problem solving, not creating more crap out of recycled tires.If you want inspiration, read these:Design Like You Give A Damn: Architectural Responses To Humanitarian CrisesandDesign Revolution: 100 Products That Empower People."
3,"So, so",The DVD contains 5 videos. I bought it last night at Wal-mart at the much better price. Is it worth the money? No. But you you have five bucks why not to buy this DVD instead of a Burger King Value Meal? Much less fat and calories...
3,Honest_Reviewer,This movie is family and kid oriented. Very easy to understand and nothing shocking. I would say its good for children but the storyline could be more interesting (it was a bit boring). Me and my family are big fans of Anne of Green Gables. This movie does not compare so I am a bit sorry for wasting my money.
5,Moving combination of songs and duets,"As a long time Jimmy Webb fan (I saw him recently in concert in Kansas City with Michael Feinstein) and an admirer of Carly Simon I must have listened to the CD over a hundred times. The duet ""Spring will be a little late this year"" makes me remember those close to me that I have lost all of whom looked forward to their next spring. Such a treat to listen to good music by those who both write and sing! Donna Brown"
3,CARLY TORCHES AGAIN,"I really like Carly Simon and have many of her albums. But I must admit that I don't feel Carly's voice is best suited for standards. Her gruff, smoky voice is perfect for her pop material but it somehow seems out of place on her standards collections. I feel the same about Rod Stewart's American Songbook series. Linda Ronstadt's oldies work because her voice is suitable for any kind of music.FILM NOIR captures the seamy side of 1940s screen classics. The best of the lot are I'M A FOOL TO WANT YOU, LAST NIGHT WHEN WE WERE YOUNG and SPRING WILL BE A LITTLE LATE THIS YEAR, a touching duet with songwriter Jimmy Webb. I have to wonder why, out of all the men she could have chosen to sing TWO SLEEPY PEOPLE with, why select John Travolta? Bad choice, bad result.I certainly support any artist's right to choose their material, I am merely expressing my opinion on that choice. But Carly, I still love that boy in the trees, your sultry spy and hope you'll be comin around again!"
1,Not at all what the reader may expect.,"If you are looking for a book on social criticism than this may be the book for you. If you are a serious Sherlockian looking for an interesting story about your favorite consulting detective, then this will be a major letdown."
4,"Excellent, but somewhat dated, travel guide.","As long as the reader understands that this book was released in 2004, before Hurricane Katrina, this is still a very useful guide to New Orleans, especially the French Quarter. Some businesses have changed or gone under due to the lack of tourist trade, but the French Quarter had almost no significant damage from the storm. We visited New Orleans in June of 2008, so we took this book with us. There is a revised issue coming in the late Fall of 2008, so if your trip is after that time wait for the new revision. The information is very well presented, and the book is a great carry-around guide."
3,good price for two blu ray movies.,Good price.both movies are on separate disks.only bug is that the witch movie is only 1080i and stereo 2.0.the other movie is fine with 1080p and 5.1 surround
2,Strieber's return to fiction lacks creative magic.,"Whitley Strieber, after writing two non-fiction accounts of his experiences with apparent non-human intelligence, returned to the fiction arena with this rather uninspired novel about the infamous Roswell incident. Strieber breaks no new ground, simply retelling the documented events and, when the time comes to fill in the blanks, he lets the book slip into confusing pseudo-mysticism and offers no concrete payoff. A real disappointment from a writer I have sadly become used to being disappointed by."
2,Intifada?,"I was as intrigued and inspired by this Haggadah as any reviewer. I was taken aback and jolted out of my spiritual reverie when during the seder we read a passage that lamented Pharoah not responding to the Jewish 'intifada'. So, the authors compared the defiance of 450 years of Jewish slavery to the Palestinian uprising of our time. In using the word, 'Intifada' the authors had to intend for the audience to draw parallels between both uprisings, thus making a bold political statement that alienated myself and others at the table. I wouldn't recommend this Hagaddah unless one has strong leftist tendencies vis a vis Israeli politics and can stomach that kind of comparison being made during one's Passover seder."
4,Little sympathy,"I have lived in gang infested areas in America and I have traveled to Cambodia while living in Asia. These men will be fine in Cambodia as long as they don't bring that disgusting American gang mentally to Cambodia. People of Cambodia live a simple, yet beautiful life and the culture is rich. These young men would be wise to try to understand this and stop acting as if it impossible to adapt. People do it all the time having grown up in America. As for the deportation process, the law is to keep people who are given a once in a lifetime opportunity to come to America from becoming menaces to society. We can't bend the laws every time we feel sorry for someone. Millions of immigrants (legal and illegal) have similar sob stories. Should we let all of them stay after hearing their sob stories after they break the laws?"
4,Kept me guessing,"Mr. Odom has a easy to read, natural style. I love a mystery and although this is not a true mystery in the ""who done it""style, it kept me guessing until the last page. Bravo, Mr. Odom."
3,"Not for Wii, otherwise fine","I wanted to review this in case others, like me, were considering it for an alternative for the weak resistance band that comes with EA Sports Active. The handles on this cable are extremely stiff, even in normal use. This makes it extremely difficult to exercise with the Wii controls in each hand. Even during simple exercises, such bicip curls, the Wii would not recognize when I completed a rep because I had to struggle to get the remote to the right position.Go with something else if you need this for the Wii. Otherwise, it's a good cable that could use some less restrictive handles."
4,Great Work Out Cable,"Great little work out tool. It is nice to be able and change the tension by adding or removing bands. Well made and quick to add or remove resistence. I use these bands to suplement my free weight work outs. Also, I was able to use these bands to help rehab an injured shoulder."
3,Not enough tension,I had two fold them into then workout and tension got decent I would recommend for a beginner.i was expecting heavy duty band not beginner bands.
5,GREAT DEVICE FOR HOME/TRAVEL WORKOUTS,"If you can't get to the gym or are traveling, this is a great device to keep in shape. I like that you can quickly change the cables and increase or decrease the tension. The handles are comfortable to grip and the stretching action is smooth, providing ample resistance throughout movements. Unlike the old metal-spring cables, a tubing exppander can easily be packed in a travel bag. You can find more than a dozen movements by searching the Web or you can invent your own routines. I also like that with an expander you can hit the majority of muscles, even the legs. Eventually, you'll have to replace the cables, so inspect them before using to make sure there are no cracks or other damage. Go for it!"
3,Plastic dominoes!,"I bought this as a gift for a Coca Cola collector, and I was disappointed when she opened them up because the dominoes are made of very lightweight plastic. I assumed that they were ""real"" dominoes. They don't even have any numbers on the back. You just match the pictures. We played with them, but I was a little embarrassed that they were so flimsy, and seemed cheap. The container they came in was cute though, and we did enjoy our game. I was just expecting regular size/weight dominoes."
3,"Great account, but too much God drivel","She has a very compelling history, but it is marred by religious arrogance -- a million slaughtered and she is spared by God to tell her story? She was lucky -- the end and that's enough. Despite the God mumbo-jumbo spirituality, the book held my attention as a first-hand witness to man at his most vicious and cruel."
3,Left to tell...My Questions,"The Left to Tell book has done much to raise awareness of the Rwandan genocide, and of course I am sincerely happy she survived. There are some honest issues of integrity with the story, however. Immaculee, like every other Rwandan, learned English in high school, rather than by the gift of tongues. Also from my talks with Rwandans living in the United States, there are questions regarding how a bathroom like that would have been available in her village. Normally, they use pit latrines. There are some other issues that make the book confusing to me, because I know so many from the country. The Missionaries of Charity also do not allow pictures to be taken at their orphanages. It's easy to get a crowd of kids around you and take a picture in Rwanda...I am glad she survived and sorry for her plight, but I question the packaging of the book."
5,Left To Tell,This Book is such an eye opener. I loved this book and this is my 2nd copy because I kept leanding out my other and now don't know where it is. Finding God is such an important thing and seeing how he works threw her eys was so awe inspiring. We want from time to time to turn our backs on the terrible things that life throws at other people and cultures. This happened and we need never to forget it. We need to teach our children of this hate and to now be like this. To stand up for each other; no matter what they believe or what tribe or nationality they are. Just like the Killing of the Jews it can not be forgotten. And we need to stop repeating this kind of haterid. This woman is an AMAZING woman.
5,Empowering,"I was absolutely astonished at how deep Immaculee's story touched my heart. I felt completely empowered by her strength and determination. I felt as if I was there with her and I couldn't put the book down. I am blessed to have been introduced to this book and grateful to have learned of this historical event that I had no prior knowledge of. I was originally assigned this book for a class that I am taking and though I read it only once to complete my assignment, I plan to read it again and again. Particularly to reinforce the empowerment I felt while reading her story. Immaculee - Thank you for sharing your experience!!"
5,READ IT!! Truly Inspiring!,"If this woman doesn't inspire you, you need to read the book again. If she still doesn't inspire you, you really need serious help. This book touched me so deeply I have been promoting her web site and telling everyone I know about her and her story. I have even written and recorded a song about her! EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK!!!"
5,Transformative!,"What an inspiring and compelling book! Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.What I'm struck with most is the example Immaculee offers of finding her faith amidst such horror, and being able to transform anger and hate into forgiveness and love. Her dedication to living and being of service is an inspiration. One can wonder how people do this in life, Immaculee shares a story that tells me how she did it (not just that she did it.) She offers hope for many."
5,Inspirational,This is an incredibly inspirational book. I wish everyone could read it. Perhaps we would live in a better world.I highly recommend this--
5,Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust,"Amazing story. I strongly suggest everyone to read the story, it's profound and a real eye opener. As an American, the majority of us have no idea what it's like to be put into poverty and suffering as she and millions like her have experienced."
1,Bottom Line:It's Bottom Line,"The book My Gal Sunday is slow reading. It tells you who did it,and why before you get to the next page. I'm sure this was not her best work. Who is Sunday and Henry? How can all this happen to a ex-president and his congresswoman bride?"
2,I couldn't finish it.,"Having read several of her books in the past, that I really enjoyed, I was disappointed in this book. I read the first 2 short stories and then put the book down. I hate not finishing books but I just wasn't getting into this one at all."
2,Less than Ms. Clark's Best,"My neighbor gave me this book. I suppose she remembered that I had told her that I had read several of Ms. Clark's novels. I have read her works but they were her earlier novels which I enjoyed. However I thought ""My Gal Sunday"" was a disappointing read. I actually had to force myself to finish this book. The husband and wife team were so sweet and dear that I thought I was reading a grade school story. The short stories didn't hold my interest and was glad to finish this book. Definitely not Ms. Clarks best. I'm sorry to say, there are no recommendation here. I'll probably try her new release just to see if her writing style has improved."
3,Easy reading for relaxing,"It was quite interesting getting to know this husband and wife team. True, this is not the type of book that will make you think and contemplate- but yet, if you love short stories and just want to relax - hey, it's summer! - then this one is okay"
2,Very Disappointing,"Mary Higgins Clark used to write excellent mystery thrillers. This book shows nothing of that talent. There is no character depth, no real suspense, and no attempt to involve the reader in the story. I only hope the author will return to her old form in her next book"
2,EHH...NOT MY CUP OF TEA,"as a mary higgins clark fan... i didnt enjoy this book that much it has 3 different stories in it, but i didnt find it that interesting.."
4,Fluff but fun,"Ok, so it wasn't a collection of mystery stories to make youthink or keep you up at night, but it was a fun, quick read. Henry and Sunday are a likable couple and I look forward to reading more of their adventures."
1,Watching a wheel go round is more fun that reading this!,"Having read a few of Mary Higgins Clark's books I could not believe that this book was written by the same person. I have not been able to finish this book; it's so very very boring! This is a miserable collection of short stories and a complete waste of precious paper! I wish I could send it back for a refund - reason : lack of content, please recycle!"
1,Barbie and Ken go Sleuthing!,Give me a break! Although I do like mHC's work I found this to be a bore. mHC is a good writer and when she wants can really draw a reader in but one irritating quality she has is that she uses uppity characters once too often; does the well to do only have fun? This is my one big complaint and since this book was such a bore to begin with using characters such as Henry and Sunday well that really did it to me. boring! mary honey there are others in the world besides snobs you can use to write about.
3,"Nice, quick mysteries","I picked up this book at the library, as it was the only one by Mary Higgins Clark that I hadn't read yet (because I had read such poor reviews). It was definitely WORTH the read. The mysteries are quick and easy....no 300+ pager here. The only bad thing was that I really didn't care for the ending on the last story. it just kind of ended very suddenly, when things were getting good. Overall though, this book was a quick read and was enjoyable. I loved the characters, although I couldn't relate to that terrible yearning to go home and make my husband a gourmet meal!"
2,Not the original recordings,"I picked this CD because it seemed to have the songs I wanted, and the cost was low.Clearly it's Melanie singing, but unfortunately neither ""Lay Down"" nor ""Roller Skate"" are the original recordings."
4,Chewing the Fat,"I have loved most of Bill Cosby's books, yet his two most recent publications, this one and ""Congratulations! Now What? A Book for Graduates"" have fallen very flat. Perhaps I would have appreciated this book more if I was in the same age group. Even as health conscious as I am, I still think Cosby missed the mark.Each chapter continues a theme of the pitfalls of getting old. Whether it means having to change your diet or alter other vices from your life, the body cannot have certain things if we are to live a long life. Obviously, Cosby takes a humorous approach to this subject. He does not actually claim to be a health expect. The problem is that Cosby's jokes have already been done, mostly by many other people.I would recommend most of Cosby's books expect those cited. It seems Cosby is at his best when he is talking about the family or experiences of his youth. In his most recent work, he may be straying too far outside his strength."
3,Look great,"The main reason I purchased these was to scare away a Blue Heron that has been eating my fish.A few minuses. The metal is very thin and the legs fall off when you lift them up. The anchors for the legs are useless - simply use large stones on the feet to keep them in place.On the plus side, they look great around my pond. They have kept the Blue Heron away. And the price was right!I sprayed on a couple of coats of clear coat to keep the metal from rusting."
5,Friendship and betrayal...,"An attractive alcoholic is befriended by a plain, cunning woman who eventually tries to steal Katie's life. Engrossing."
4,"Good, but could be better","I have read the first and second part of Drake's series, and the first one (Blood Red Moon) is better. I did appreciate the steamy romance, but was disappointed by the numerous typos. Also, the villain's physical appearance is wrongly described. The first mention of him says that he is dark haired with golden eyes. after that he is said to have blond hair and dark eyes. it did confuse me for a while, and made me believe there were two villains. Also, there are too many secondary unimportant characters, and this muddled the plot. Overall, it was a good read, and I suppose i will read the last installment of the trilogy just to see how it all ends."
5,Interesting book.,"I was originally looking for a book of poems by Yates, but found this one. Very interesting and not something I would have chosen otherwise but am glad that serendipity sent it to me. It is one of life's little pleasures!"
1,Deleted it,I found this useless and deleted it after only a few minutes. It was not worth the space it takes on my Kindle.
1,Don't buy this title!!,"This title is the bootleg title for a film called the The Ratings Game. I'm no sure why Amazon is selling this on their web site.The quality of this DVD is terrible, I was suspicious when I got it. The DVD caseand the DVD itself look like they were home made.Having said all this, knockoff or not this is a bad film with a lot of big names in it.It's like they were trying to make something campy and failed big time. I expected more of Danny DeVito."
3,imagintive but slow,"I was blown away by the description that Gowdy used to describe the life of an elephant. You rarely find a book that gives you the perspective of the animal without it seeming like a human in an animal's body. Although the book was fascinating, the plot didn't stand. As an another reviewer said all the elephants seemed to do was eat, sleep, dig for water, and lament over their dead. Excellent read if you're looking for a unique view but a dull plot,"
3,A moving adventure of large proportions,"Gowdy designs an interesting world of elephant life that is simple, yet touching. The story of Mud is both a beautiful and horrific tale of coming of age. Most striking is the effectiveness of narrative from the perspective of the elephants. The book's weakness, however, is its repetitiveness as the animals constantly search the desert for food and their lost family members.I would shy from comparisons between ""The White Bone"" and ""Watership Down."" The latter is a literary masterpiece, but the former is merely a good read."
1,poor quality,"I picked these bowls up in a friday sale for ... bucks, and this will be the first purchase I send back ... The quality was pretty poor - the wood is rough in spots, finish is not consistent and one of the chopsticks was bent. The bowls are also very light and thin. They look good in the picture but not close up. You get what you pay for."
1,like splinters? love these bowls!,"poor craftmanship makes using these bowls risky. The holes where the chopsticks are to rest are roughly done, jagged wood sticks out making a hazard. A lousy buy at any price."
2,A detective that doesn't detect.,"The book claims to be about two or three things: an attack on the protagonist, her mother's health and the failure of a company. But in only the third case does the investigator (the protagonist) make any headway; in the other two, everything is revealed in an unnecessary confession."
5,Very good..,Does the job it's suppose to. I would recommend for extra support as I use it on my Fluval heater. My Piranhas kept running into it.
4,Almost Brilliant,"Great Spiritualized full length. Last of their drone-y style releases. Not as captivating as the perfect ""Lazer Guided Melodies"", anor enthralling as ""Ladies and Gentlemen, We Are Floating In Space"", but certainly close behind those two."
4,Perspective is timeless,"I don't think I'll ever view the medical profession the same way I did before reading this book. The Healers does what only history can do - it tells the truth about beauty. In this case, it strips the profession of its aura, letting the reader see some of the dirty laundry (George Washington's physicians, for example), as well as its heroes (or heroines as the case may be for medical education reformers). It certainly helps to put managed care, technology, money and the profession in perspective. It's a timeless treasure in my opinion."
5,It's been 3 years!!,"It's been three years since I first read this book and I can't say ""I love this book!"" enough. An amazing novel for young girls that teaches independence. The author has a great sense of humor that shines through the story. Ruby Lavender is a perfect character for the plot and fits in expertly. The setting is described wonderfully and is also a fun environment for the character's to interact in. The author makes the read more whymsical by adding the letters that Ruby writes, instead of just saying ""Ruby wrote a letter saying..."" It also provides for a more realistic feeling. I don't have any suggestions for improvements that could be made on this masterpeice. I have read this book four times in the past three years and am still discovering new details. Anyone who ventures out into the magical world of ""Love, Ruby Lavender"" is on the right path and will enjoy the walk thoroughly."
5,I love this show,Dharma and Greg are so adorable together. I'm so glad they've finally put this show out on DVD!
4,I love it,"I'm not giving it 5 stars because it's too expensive and I miss extras, but this is my favorite show, I love Dharma and her parents, their hippie positive attitude to life, I wish I'd have persons like them around me, I'm still waiting for the other seasons."
2,Better options available.,"I bought this because I have a very weak stomach. When we got our puppy I figured this would be my best bet when it came to avoiding picking up after my dog with just a bag (by hand). When it came in the mail, the forked edges were bent over and not straight. This made ""scooping"" almost impossible also it usually ends up making a mess then it's worth. DO NOT USE ON FRESH MESS! YUCK! The only way I could recommend this would be to use it after the mess has been sitting for a few days. It would work much better in that situation."
5,one of the best of all time,I owned this Four Tops album in vinyl. This is one of the best albums of all time. If you don't own it and you like R&B you are mssing something.
3,Useful but too noisy,"Adequate classic distortion--but, beyond the twelve o'clock mark, the pedal is far more noisy than it ought to be. I thought at first I had a defective pedal, but it wasn't my particular pedal that was the problem. It's a DS1 issue. A pedal you should probably have in your arsenal but one that's limited by its noisiness."
1,Bought it but didn't use it.,"I brought this product to my mechanic to see if it is advisable to add to my coolant while at service. He told me never use with aluminum radiators. Also there is nothing wrong with my coolant system so he flushed the system with distill water and added Toyota Red coolant to a mix approximately 50/50.The mechanic added, only Royal Purple product he might use is brake fluid for its color so when you flush the brake system you can easier to tell the fluid is clear when purple fluid starts breeds out.I was laughing reading those reviews of swearing up and down how good all the Royal Purple products are. Those clowns are very likely working for or owning Royal Purple."
4,Am Pleased,"Recieved it. Had it hooked up, programmed and running in 15 minutes. The program may be a lil difficult for the average Joe. But I use it with windows movie player and am pleased with it.The bottom line is: I believe I got what I paid for. And satisfied."
2,quite difficult,The picture on the outside of the box is slightly different than the actual puzzle. Very frustrating. Love the picture not sure if I am patient enough to ever finish. Very small pieces.
3,Gag Gift Turns 2 Gold,"Marla Gibbs: Ms. 227 herself, who'd a thunk it: a jazz singer. However, it was at her Supper Club in L.A. that two of the best Etta James albums in the 80's were recorded, live no less, - but I digress......this CD is like Nancy Wilson's *RSVP* CD: some nice standards with some rarely sung tunes. I bought it just for a gag, but it turned out that the goof was on me and this was actually pretty solid. Don't underestimate this sista."
3,"Well written, but small and dated","Here's the thing about Good to Great: it's a well-written study that belies its underlying flaw - that it's a very tiny study. That is to say the entire set of core principles upon which the book is founded derives from just 11 companies. Now there are some great learnings from the leaders of those companies, don't get me wrong, but I'm not willing to stake my entire paradigm perception of good business models on such a small and dated study (it is now over half a decade old). For a much better look into successful managers and their behavior patterns, see Buckingham's ""First Break All the Rules"", which was a Gallup study of over 10,000 managers. Three stars: five stars for excellent research and writing, minus two stars for impact and size of study (and subsequent relevence)."
5,Good to Great,"Finally a book based on extensive research on why companies are truly excellent in what they do. No fads, no flash in the pans just hard work that's focus on their mission and core business. In my mind a must read for anyone who is tired of mediocrity or the status quo."
3,Mediocre book with few useful items for a startup,"Our class was required to read this book within the Founder Institute, an entrepreneurial program. While interesting I really don't see how people rave about this book. Good to Great does have more insights for a larger company but for the startup most of this isn't that practical. The deepest criticism I have is that there are five or six key points made and the knowledge could have been communicated in a few bullet points. Not a bad read but there are many other business books I would read before this one (Four Steps to the Epiphany being a great one)."
1,From Bad to Worse,"If I were giving out stars for book titles I'd give this five - it's perfect. The content however is far less than that. The ""research"" is at best questionable and further, there is nothing new here. If you are among the many looking to move from good to great (and aren't we all) and hope to find the answers in this book you will be disappointed. Pop management books are easy to find and even easier to sell - do your research, there are better resources out there."
4,A good to great read!,"A very well researched and clearly written study of 11 good companies, and how they became great. By applying the principles taught in this book, combined with actual research data showing the difference between what makes a company (or yourself) great, anyone can benefit."
1,Not impressed at all,Too general and stereotypical of large structures. Does not take into consideration the phase before which is from zero to good.
2,No Rocket Science,"Its very simple why MOST companies don't become great. They dont want to !! Its alot cheaper to just edge out your competition (if you even have to), than to start a price war, or any other kind of war. Also, most companies are clueless, since they cant tell the difference between an investment, and a cost. They would rather not invest in their people because, they either might take the jobs of the one who taught them, or go somewhere else, and get paid a higher salary, from a company that didnt have to invest in them, so then that other company can then steal what they didnt have to invest in. Lets face it, the company with the lowest cost wins. That one statement explains everything else. There will never be greatness as long as this is true. The race to the botton, trumps the race to the top."
4,Great book!,This book has been recommended by many and many professors and colleagues. I now offer my recommendation for this book to you. Get this book!
5,"Good to Great - Timeless, Inspiring","When I first heard of this book I expected another management snoozer filled with platitudes. It's anything but. Yes, ""great"" is distilled down to a manageable number of primary concepts and findings, but Collins' authorship makes it a compelling read as he proves and disproves his own preconceptions. This was as meaningful to me as Peters' In Search of Excellence and Porter's Competitive Strategy."
4,Good Adventure to Venture Through,"Good to Great was a very easy and enjoyable read that gives the reader a good understand of what it takes to make a good company a great one. Collins and his research team spend five years researching and analyzing Fortune 500 companies to see what trends or similarities prevailed. In the end, they came up with seven key elements that all need to be present in order for a company to be considered ""great"";1) Level 5 Leadership2) First Who...Then What3) Confronting the Brutal Facts4) The Hedgehog Concept5) Technology Accelerators6) A Discipline Culture7) The Flywheel and Doom LoopCollins walks through and explains these elements in a way that makes the reader understand the importance of them and how they all work together.I would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in the professional business world. The practices can be applied to a business, department, organization, or even your day to day activities."
4,A Quick Read,"This book provides the conclusions of a research study undertaken to try and answer the question in the title. It includes plenty of hard data and methodology, but the bulk of it is conclusions and anecdotes.I personally felt that the material provided, at the very least, a new perspective to look at your business processes and see room for improvement. It seems like everyone today has a ""MAKE MONEY FAST"" solution to every company's problems, and this book includes some element of that. However, the real message is to look deeply into the real potential of your business for your future direction and to never waver from that path.I found the book easy to read, and I will probably look closely at the author's past and future publications for more information as well."
5,The best book on my book shelf,"This book becomes one of my best collections on my book shelf. As a business owner, I appreciated author's practical teaching on how to become a good business owner. I will pass this book to my son and my friends so that more people will benefit from it. This is not a book. This a must read book if you are serious in business."
2,From GOOD TO SUCKS,"this book can be read just by reading the first couple of chapters, other than that its a waste of your time. this books took years of research and interviews to arrive at this conclusion? and a whole team of researchers at that? This book is no great break through, its just common sense and repeating of the main concept over and over and over and over and over again, the end. You know how alot of books should be alot shorter, but they just fill it with[..]to make you fill like its a real book? this is that."
2,Not my idea of a great life!,"I read the first two chapters of ""Good to Great.""The book has some really great examples of the traits inherent in a great leader and company, but some of the reasons it gives as to why you should have a great company and be a ""5 Level Leader"" are just blatantly stupid.I found that what they are deeming a ""great"" company is whether they were Fortune 500 Companies. That's it! That's all! Nothing more. That's what makes a great company? Wow.One of their primary examples is a CEO that finally made his company great (Gillette) and then had himself a heart- attack.Great example.They mention that if the CEO hadn't prevailed then ""none of us would be shaving with Sensor, Sensor for Women, or Mach 3 - leaving hundreds of millions of people to a more painful daily battle with stubble.""Great argument for why you should put yourself before the company.I was going to read further but didn't have the stomach . . ."
5,All points are supported by facts,"What makes this book very different is, it is based on facts captured through five years of extensive research by a group of dedicated people. It is inspiring yet not pure theory. Although the emphasis of the book is how to be the best in the world; I read it with an eye on ""how to be among the top in your market segment or as a matter of fact in your daily life"". If not all, many of the points apply to Big companies. For example, hiring the best and getting rid of mediocre people. Small companies and Sole Propritership does not have this luxury. Therefore you need to use a bit of imagination and relax some rules to be ""among the top"" which may take you to the top. Trying to apply some very strict rules without many resources at your hand could be a disaster. Overall, this is among the best business books I have read."
1,Wasted my time reading this,This book has nothing to offer. Can't understand why people would give it more than 2 stars.
2,Not Impressed,Book was advertised as used like new condition. Luckily I used a gift card or I would have returned and flamed the seller. I will not buy from them again.
4,surprising and digestible for anyone who can read english,This book is the product of a lot of work in terms of time and debate about values.Reassuringly it provides emphatic powerful evidence of the values of:. honesty. decent human behaviour. recognition of strengths and weaknesses. discipline through self to corporate. despite the nature of the businessin developing great enterprises in a modern era.The sequel of what happens to these iconic companies over the next 1/2 decade of recession will make compulsive readingPeter Wallace
2,My Kindle Keyboard didn't like this... (Kindle Version),"While the content of the book is what it is, all of the tables and graphics were shrunk to near-illedgible making many of the consolidation of the points in this book difficult to read.My advice is to get a hard copy, as this book didn't make the coversion to E-reading well."
5,Useful for the Key Managers in An Organization,"This is another book from the new trend of collecting data, and come out with a summary. Instead of having a set of guidance in mind and trying to convince the readers abuot its value, books like this one and the ""First, Break All the Rules"" did the survey and extract the common factors among the subjects.I know several companies bought many copies of this book and distributed to their middle and high level managers. An easy reading that is quite useful!"
1,Worthless,"Yet another engagingly well written, but essentially useless, book on how to run a great company. Collins presents a number of case studies purporting to show what he says are the keys to running a great company. Problem is, they're also characteristics of many failed companies. And his insights aren't terribly deep, either: Hire good people. Know your market.The secret, if there is one, to running a great company isn't going to be found in a book; if it was, the business schools wouldn't be full of MBA candidates. There is no secret. It's a matter of knowledge, experience, vision, and perhaps a certain amount of good fortune, none of which are cheap or easy to acquire."
5,Good to Great...is great!,Good to Great to me was recommended by a friend. I thought the book was very though inspiring and put into words things I knew but did not know how to put together. Great book!
3,"OK material, grating delivery","The material in the book seems good; Collins has managed to extract some fascinating conclusions from his data, though as other reviwers have pointed out, the companies profiled have not continued their success post the end of Collins' study.What made the audiobook only worthy of three stars was the amazingly anoying delivery by Mr. Collins. Every! word! is a reason! for an exclamation! point! Man - go take your ritalin, or lay off the speed...I may pick up Collins' next work, but I'll make sure it is the book, and not the CD."
5,Powerful Must Read for Senior Management,"What a great book! I couldn't put it down and have suggested it to our CEO and President. Insightful, surprising results, based on sound research. This is a must read for companies focused on excellence and growth."
5,this book is very helpful,"Not just a restatement of company statistics or financial reports, this book offers critical analysis of successful and very successful companies and the strategies and tactics that produced the differences. The author goes to great length to explain why some companies do just OK, and why others are great successes. The analysis is very useful to my business."
2,Not Good,"Writing as a big fan of previous release, God Shuffled his feet, this is a big let down. It's an even greater disappointment, considering that I waited 8 years from its release date to finally sample its fruit. All that anticipation, every day of those 8 long years, for this prolix attempt to pass this cd off as art? Mind you, I'm as pretentious as the next guy, but there are some things I can't even pretend to get. Shout out to Robert Schumann though."
1,Fanatics Unite!,"Some music fans (note: the word ""fan"" is derived from ""fanatic.""), will go to great lengths in denial defending their Gods. In this case the Gods are The Crash Test Dummies. This ""collection"" is so bad, in so many ways, only a true ""fanatic"" would find any redeeming qualities in it. It really is an insult to anyone who bought it."
2,"Not a ""How To""","I was very disappointed in this video. For the price, I expected some instruction on how to customize a Ruger Vaquero. Instead, this was a basic overview of the type of customizations a gunsmith like the author could perform for you. There were a couple of items mentioned that a viewer could perform for themselves, but the steps were not very clear because disassembly of the Vaquero was covered in a different video that could be purchased seperately. Overall, not worth the money that I paid for this item."
4,Info about the mixes,"Okay. Here goes. 'That Don't Impress Me Much' is the remix used on the radio, and it's listed as the dance mix edit (so where's the full length dance mix!!!). Track 2 is listed on the CD sleeve as the tempo mix of 'From this Moment On,' but it is the dance mix, and it's awesome! Unfortunately, it's rather short, and sounds like it fades just when it's heading towards being a club anthem (again, where's the long version???). The third track is 'From this moment on', and is listed as the dance mix on the sleeve, but it is not. It's the Shania solo ballad version that one of the other customers was requesting in his comments. No background vocals by the male."
1,Harley Davidson 426306 Digital Headphone Radio,"After having a Sony radio of the same type - this is a poor alternative. I wish I hadn't ordered online without seeing and trying it first. Radio has many flaws, poor sound quality, poor level adjustment, tight, unadjustable fit, among others. When you turn it in you have to cahnge bands in order for it to work. I'm sorry I bought it."
3,Springs can't take heavy use.,"Well, it is one of those things that are great while it lasted. Which for this thing was about four days. So popular was this, that we loaded and loaded it again and again for our boys, and it worked great at first, but, no matter how careful you might be, and we are, the ""snakes"" start to lose the evenness of the spring conformity, and then kinks set it, and then it won't fire them out as well as it did at first. This does not get better with time. Tried to fix them, and could not. That is all I have."
4,Surprise in a Can!,"This can of snakes does basically what it is meant to do. That is, it surpises your friends one time, and good! The design of the can is deceptive enough to invite the curious. After all, who can resist jelly beans! And boy do these snakes fly! Right across the room! One thing to be wary of is the cap and grooves on the can -they are not the best and most secure as the platic groove does not hold the cap on very well and has a ""hair trigger"". In fact, you can overturn the cap, resulting in a misfire. Would have prefered a metal can with secure cap staying power. But for the price, you just have to order one!"
3,things to know about this product,"ok, so please read my review before purchasing this!the pros:small, cute, silver, pretty powerful... i've had some decent 'experiencees' with this. nothing too impressive, though. it does come in a cute silk bag and is non-threatening to boys.the cons:this vibe is VERY LOUD! BZZZZZZZZZZZ your roomates will know you're trying to get off. also: it requires 4 CAMERA batteries to run! i purchased replacements and it cost me $15.00 or $16.00 for new batteries... more expensive then the vibe itself! (I also had to go around everywhere asking people at Radio Shack and CVS for the right kind of batteries - they were hard to find). let me tell you this - next time i run out of batteries, i'm just going to buy a new vibe that runs on AAs and not waste $16 bucks on new batteries. DONT BUY THIS VIBE (unless you have access to many many cheap camera batteries)!!!"
2,RMS Titanic Construction,"I am very disappointed in the editing of the book, many many typographical errors! Also, the book did not go into detail about the various construction techniques that went into building the ship. I wanted a step by step process especially in the interior construction of the cabins and public rooms, i.e. construction from the bulkhead/exterior skin, insulation, woodwork, plastering, wiring, plumbing etc."
3,NOTICE,"i installed this in my car myself. as far as getting the item everything was fine. however, the harness is flawed. the constant power wire and the acc wire are backwards and must be matched with each other. IE yellow with red and red with yellow. sounds wrong but its the only way to get your head unit to not clear everything when you cut the power in your car"
1,Have plenty of coffee,"This film dragged. The best part was the opening 10 minutes and went down hill from there. Most of the actors could have phone in their parts. The only one who appeared to even try was Kiefer Sutherland. Visually this was a beautiful movie. But, many scenes were too long or added little to the overall plot. Kirsten Dunst is a good actor. I've seen her in some very good movies, however, she missed on this one."
1,Don't Watch,"Movie was not good, just boring. All the people that rated it five star would be entertained and 'moved' by watching paint dry. If people consider this art, its art like the weird metal shapes people in their yards, where their neighbors think, ""Why would they do that, and I wish it would just go away"""
1,Truly a drudge,"I cannot believe that such an admirable cast could have signed up for such a drudge of a movie. Slow, dragging and uninteresting do not quite cover the range of adjectives that describe this movie. To the cast of characters: Its time to move on."
1,I don't give many 1-star reviews but this deserves it,"One of the worst movies I've seen. If you want a movie that moves slower than life itself, and makes you feel terrible the entire time, this is it. Just over 2 hrs of my life that I'll never get back. Don't bother with this, seriously."
4,Breathless.....,"That's what this film leaves you. Kirsten plays her best role ever and the mix between the charactor's relationships & the ""planet X"" theory is beautifully and poetically written. 4-STARS!!!"
1,"You're too dumb for this movie, and so was I","This film was long, tedious, overwrought with baseless emotion, etc, etc.I would have rather been doing laundry then wasting my life watching Melancholia. You've been warned."
1,terrible,terrible. the story is awful. i got sick like i was watching blair witch. cant say enough bad things about it.
2,I should have seen it before buying the DVD!,"I had such high expectations for this movie...and then, ho-hum...So disappointed.It was too 'all over the place'...and somehow left me feeling somewhat captive in these people's twisted and staged lives... To me it was worth 'nothing' (pun intended!)"
1,Require much patience and causing headaches and nausea,"Very slow motioned. Requires a lot of patience to get into it. Then the camera was handheld, like a home video. The shaking of the images caused me huge headaches and nausea. Could not watch for more than 10min."
1,So Disappointing,"It was just toooooo slow. I couldn't understand why this guy wanted to marry this girl if he already knew they would never get along. Why go through the trouble of marrying her and then leave her after the wedding? I wish I could've cared about these characters, but the movie was just too boring."
1,Rip-off,"Very short review: Cynical rip off of a great movie called ""Another Earth"". Stay with the originality of a work of art and don't support robbers."
1,Horrible,"Most long, drawn out convoluted movie ever. Didn't help that the movie kept starting and stopping. Finally just gave up after one hour. Don't waste your time unless you want to get depressed."
1,Terrible movie,"This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. The plot was ridiculous and the entire movie dragged on and on. I've read other reviews from people who suffer from depression and they seem to have related to it. I have never suffered depression so I cannot relate to this movie at all nor do I see the point of it. Slow, boring, depressing, dark with not much of a plot. I gather we're supposed to feel for Justine but her actions are so selfish and destructive that it's difficult to understand her. I wish I hadn't wasted my time but I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this garbage."
1,Couldn't make it through 30 minutes,"I was really looking forward to this film,as the trailers made it look really interesting, but after 20 minutes of plotless romantic wanderings I couldn't take it anymore."
1,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL- dont waste your time,I am almost 60 years old AND THIS IS THE WORST FILM I HAVE _EVER_ ENDURED. If I had seen it in a theater I would have demanded a full refund for my money and regretted the irreplacable 2 hours and 16 minutes lost of my time. It was like a rambling pointless improvisation on Quaaludes -- how could they even print this to film. TAKE MY WARNING AND AVOID!!!
1,"Prentitious, long and dull","This is another pretentious claptrap that uses CGI for some fancy animation about death (ENTER THE VOID, PAN'S LABYRINTH) for 10 minutes, then it's 2 hours of boring, rich white folk's problems shot on a handheld camera. I'm sure Lars von Trie thought he was satirizing the Bourgeoisie, but he really romanticizes it. I've seen more interesting things come out of my dog's ass. On top of how dull it was, the Amazon download froze in the middle, so we had to reboot the Roku, which made the film even longer."
3,Meant for Mood,"This movie puts one in a melancholy mood. The director has said his inspiration for the movie was his observation (his personal observation from his personal life I believe) that depressed people deal better with tragedy than others. This makes sense, as a depressed person is generally detached and indifferent to life. Sometimes up to the point of physical harm and death. Such is the protagonist, played by Dunst. She's profoundly depressed.Nothing much happens beyond the beginning and the end, it's true. But it is a beautiful nothing if nothing else. 3 stars for the damned creeping sense of melancholy it produces."
4,Great way to teach numbers,Many children like BLUES CLUES and my daughter enjoys counting with Blue. Great board book for early learners.
4,FDA approved vagus nerve stimulation-a much better therapy,"In February of 2005, the FDA approved vagus nerve stimulation as a treatment for chronic depression. With this approval, for many patients electro-convulsive therapy will no longer be the most aggressive way to treat their chronic disease. Max Fink's book is very helpful in explaining and comforting a patient that is fearful of ECT. There is a terrible stigma associated with shock therapy. If it works, the relapse rate is high. For my money, I think I will go with vagus nerve stimulation and its benefits which are apparently sustained over a long time."
5,An important book to read for anyone interested in ECT,"Max Fink's book discusses ECT in detail, but also in terms that the majority of patients can understand. It is clearly written, without hype, and describes ECT from the perspective of an experienced and caring clinician. I frequently recommend it for patients who are considering ECT.As for vagus nerve stimulation, studies indicate that while it may be helpful for chronic depression, it probably takes too long (3-12 months) to work for it to be useful in an episode of acute, severe depression."
2,Shock not for everyone,"Mr.Fink's book on the wonders of E.C.T. leaves a lot of unanswered questions.Clearly Dr. Fink believes that electroshock can provide remarkable relief in the areas of clinical depression and mania.What is not answered is the memory loss that getting shock causes.I have received 2 series of electroshock-yes , I know where of I speak-and getting E.C.T. causes memory loss. I always thought it would be great if these shock doctors like Fink and Abrams would shock themselves too. I wonder if they then would be such eager advocates of electroshock."
2,Estee Lauder Travel Comb with Mirror (Travel Size),Product arrived scratched all over and covered with some sort of greasy dust. Item itself is exceptionally cheap made. Disappointed.
5,Awesome,"The lotion is amazing. I'm telling everyone I know about it and also sharing with them the catalog that came with the order. Many of the other products are products I want to try. The Hired Hand Cream results in the softest skin I've had in a long time on my arms and legs. I'm always looking for products with natural ingredients, especially herbs, and I couldn't be more please."
5,Arab Strap at its most intense,"This is, quite simply, the best live album I own or have ever heard. Arab Strap create a uniquely claustrophobic and intensely alive atmosphere with their sparse arrangments that oftentimes culminate in an orgasm of sound and fury. ""Girls of Summer"" positively explodes at the 5 minute mark, its dancefloor beat creating an overwhelming wall of sound (sorry about the cliche, but it's fitting in this case). ""New Birds"" is another highlight, the dark, mumbled, drunken story accompanied to perfection by the crashing cymbals and foreboding bass that builds throughout.Play this record as loud as possible, drink a few beers, and listen to a live show as it was meant to be recorded and experienced."
4,Turn iTunes' Sound Enhancer off while playing ripped digital version of Rubble,"Has anyone else compared the sound quality of their box set tracks to those found online at allmusic.com? The tracks on my set sound thin/distorted/excessively trebly at times...this is especially noticeable on the vocals, which fuzz when the sound of the singer's voice hits a certain point. Overall, it sounds like my box set was derived from a vinyl transfer with the volume or treble turned up too loud. Does anyone else's sound like this? I've done some research, and the consensus seems to be that an earlier release of the Rubble series (not the 2003 re-release) sound better...UPDATE 8/5/11: Ok, found out what the problem was: if you're playing any of these tunes in iTunes, it's best to play them with Sound Enhancer turned off...it boosts various aspects of the audio, including treble. That seemed to account for some or most of the high-end fuzz I've been listening to."
5,**Great Gift**,I included Puttin on the Peachtree in the gift bags for guests at my wedding. We got such fabulous comments from everyone about the cookbook. My guests *loved* it.
3,Loveboat or Titanic?,"At first listen I was ready to toss it out of the car window. But, I gave it a couple more tries and it is addictive. It falls in with their previous albums, ""I Say, I Say, I Say"" and ""Erasure"". No where near the greatness of ""Cowboy"", ""Chorus"", or even ""Wild"". A few good tracks - ""Catch 22"", ""Freedom"", and ""Here in my Heart"" - will make for excellent dance remixes."
2,DISSAPOINTMENT,"I have followed and have been a fan of erasure since wonderland. Before that of depeche mode and yazoo. I have waited in anticipation for each of the erasure releases, but this is by far the worst of the batch. The sound quality for one is terrible, you can't even hear the lyrics. It's an album full of ambient mumblings put to incoherent music. Save your money and buy the Freedom single, it's the only thing that I can listen to on the entire album. That and the packaging are the only redeeming qualities of this bomb. What a waste of time and money."
4,Very Helpful despite Appearance,"When I received this book, or booklet, I was somewhat disappointed. The typeface and layout look like a highschool handout from 1965. But the content and organization are excellent. Mysteries of German (some of them anyway) are explained for the first time. Also ways of organizing German vocabulary into thoughtful and somewhat predictible groups are included. So, once you get over the initial shock of the format, this book provides a lot of valuable content."
3,PLASTIC bird bath,"it looks very pretty but it is VERY lightweight and hollow. Needs rocks or sand put inside or it will tip over when the first bird lands on it or the wind blows. I don't see any 'red' in the 'red granite'. It looks just like the picture though. Gray granite color. I think it's a bit overpriced for a plastic bird bath. Very functional with weight added. Nice and wide, shallow bowl for the birds...."
3,Missing Joseph,"Elizabeth George has really extended herself in ""Missing George""to the point where the whole story borders on the truly unbelievable. We have colorful and well developed characters, multi-faceted plots and subplots, with teenage problems, witchcraft practicing priest's housekeeper, salacious mother, obnoxious rapist constable, and last but not least the British aristocratic ex CID agent, Thomas Linley. Wow...what's left??Well, there is more. We have thegroom who really doesn't love his pregnant bride to be, who happens to be very very rich, and a priest who doesn't show cause he's been murdered! Then there's the rectory housekeeper who has the hots for the errant groom and vice-versa. When all the above is sorted out and we come to the finish of this convoluted novel, the ending shocks us. Not George's best, by my standard, but readable and reasonably interesting.E.J. Walden, author of ""Operatin Snow Owl"""
3,Too Many Subplots,"A murder in the rectory, but why kill a priest who is about to perform a wedding ceremony? A strong beginning to a plodding novel as too many subplots clog the narrative.Elizabeth George's MISSING JOSEPH is a must read for fans of B. Havers and Insp. T. Lynley, but it will take some careful reading to match all the characters to their purpose in the story.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
4,pure George,"Last year a friend gave me George's latest work and I got hooked on the life of the main character, Sir Thomas Lynley. After I finished that one, I realized I had to read the earlier works to understand the whole character development. George's attention to detail of the physical as well as the emotional aspects of the story are amazing. If you are a detective/mystery fan, I highly recommend any one of her books as a starting point. They can stand alone or as part of the whole series. Now I have to order a couple more. . . . . ."
2,ENGLAND in the 1950's,"Something I didn't see mentioned before buying this book is that it's about ENGLAND in the 1950's. If that's what you're looking for, I'd give it four stars. But since that's not mentioned anywhere I only give it two."
5,"Thanks, HOS","I first heard (literally!) of Cirque through the Stephen Hill's ""Hearts of Space"" show which highlighted some of their music. Based on that show, I bought KA.Fantastic !!!I will be buying MORE Cirque CDs !!!!!!!!"
4,"Great, but just not enough.","Pretty good, it just isn't enough. (Like French cuisine.) After a while it gets boring, but the first few weeks (or months) with this blaring in your ears is almost heaven. Great music, as long as you don't get used to it."
4,Ka Soundtrack,"I already knew what to expect since I've seen the show, and the only disappointment is that it didnt have much of the villians music. An unexpected joy was a couple of the songs in English."
2,Looks nice but didn't last long,"I bought this item a year ago and installed when we remodeled our bathroom. It looks great and has worked great until about a month ago when the bar attachment came apart which quickly led to the entire bar falling off the wall. We now have to replace it as the enclosure is not repairable. Also wanted to note that this item was used lightly and was not something that was used on a daily basis. For the $$, feel like it should have lasted longer than 11 months of light use."
5,Too Funny and way sweet,Its an easy read with laughs and it allows you to just escape. Let go from all your woes and take a dip into fun.
5,I LOVED IT!!,"This is a comical, quirky novel about a 29yr old executive from New Jersey who's about to turn 30, and feels that her biological clock is starting to tick. She sells her $400,000 condo and resigns her high paying executive job for a beat up (she is unaware it is beat up)cabin and a hardware store in ALASKA! She is under the notion that Alaska is outnumbered by men and therefore feels that it is easier to find a husband there. From the first moment she is transporting her belongings to Al she comes across all sort of mishaps along the way. It is a lovely romantic story about how she finds true love."
2,I HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS!,"Have you ever seriously regretted spending money on a book that you thought was terrible? If so, congratulations! You know how I feel. This book was lame, lame, lame. It was sooooo boring! I was actually about halfway through this book when I got bored with it and stopped reading it. It was probably three months later when I picked it back up again to finish it. Then I kinda wished I hadn't. This was like reading an attempt by your 14-year-old friend to write a novel. Man, I could have written this book! I felt like I had heard this same story like fifteen times before. I gave this book 2 stars because some of it was kinda cute, but it was so unoriginal. I have a feeling that the same problem is going to overtake teen fiction for girls in the future."
5,cuter in person,"My little girl is 5 going into kindergarten, she loves horses so when she saw this it was a ""must have."" I was a bit leary not knowing the exact size and the feel of it, but I do have to say that we got it today and she LOVES it. It is the perfect size, book bag requirements were no wheels and should be able to fit a 2 pocket folder, which it does with no problem with room left.......it is a must have for any horse loving little girl. 5 stars*****"
3,too small and no side pockets,"It was too bad was rated so high. I bought this and the polka dot packs for my daughters in 2nd and K. I should have noticed there were no side mesh pockets, which I consider a must for packets of tissue, chapstick, hand sanitizer or other small and daily needed items. There was also no 'support' or semi rigid surface on the section which sits against the child's back -- so my K daughter who only transports a paper folder to/from school ends up with bent folders! After purchasing packs at WalMart which barely made it through the school year - I was looking for pack which would last more than 1 year. I don't know yet if they will last longer than the $11-$14 kind at discount stores. We'll see -- I don't plan to purchase again since they're smaller than a typical school backpack. I'll go with Land's end or LL Bean next time."
1,*yawn*,I wish ther was a -10. Dum story. Same old evil wolfs are bad. Y not somthing new for a change?
4,Engaging and terrific!,"This is a delightful book. It seems obvious that our long-accepted version of the Revolution is open to some serious questioning. Read this book, and give thought to the possibility that the Founding Fathers were less than we have always been told. Mr. Lussier has written a wonderful fiction, but it is even more captivating when one considers that much research seems to have gone into it. Read it and think!"
3,Eco Organizations act like greedy corporations,"Once you get past the cover picture which I guess is well chosen to illustrate the point of the book... it is an OK short read. I find it easy to believe that all big organizations work to achieve their own special interest - it doesn't matter what type of organization they are.The author basically says that ""environmental groups"" cause as much or more harm than ""greedy corporations"" ....His big examples are BP pretending to be ""green"" (spending more on PR than green products) and ""environmental groups"" getting DDT banned for all uses which makes it harder to control malaria in Africa. They are well picked examples that do illustrate the argument but the world is a very complicated place when you try to determine ""motives""."
4,"Smart, witty, and tragic",Funny and witty with characters that possessed unique sensibilities. Childress pulled me in with his light hearted and fun portrayal of a friendship. Then he shifted it someplace I would have never imagined myself headed. Childress tackles real issues such as racial intolerence and mental illness with expert precision. I started the book on a fun ride but by the time I was through reading I was left feeling sympathy towards many of the characters. All the characters stayed with me long after I finished the book. This was not wrapped in a neat little package. The book leaves you with thought provoking questions. I really enjoyed the ride of this book. Great job Mr. Childress.
5,One Mississippi,"Don't know if I sent my previous review. This is a book for the over 50 crowd. (Please, who else knows Sunbeam bread?) But, it's a good book: Ended like I wanted it to end, and not as I expected. It's now a Christmas present. (ALWAYS: you need to read the book first! ;) )"
4,Great game for dog lovers,"My daughter received a Leapster for her 5th birthday. Pet Pals was her first game and she played it non-stop. I wasn't sure it was challenging enough to hold her attention, but it really did. Maybe because she just loves dogs so much & we don't have one! She loves cleaning and grooming the dog of her choice and competing in the dog show."
4,Very nice,"My 2 1/2 year old LOVES dogs. She is very excited to play this game, and with some help, she can play some of the very basic games. Most of the games are two advanced for her, but I figured that they would be. I think in about 6 months to a year, she will benefit enjoy this game more."
4,Daughter's Favorite Leapster Game,"I got this for my three year old daughter's new Leapster. Honestly, three year olds might be a little young for Leapsters but she's getting the hang of it. This and Dora are her favorite games."
4,My daughter loves this game!,"My daughter is 6 years old and finds this game to be very fun. She was able to figure out how to play it fairly quickly. I'm not sure how educational it is in terms of math or reading but she does enjoy ""taking care of"" the dogs on there and giving them names."
1,My Friends And My Enemies,"I have to say that this is pretty funny. An artist with no talent gets a greatest hits collection. What can I say, that's how music is today. I would like to comment on two reviews I saw earlier. They uneased me. First, a gentleman said that Kenny G was the greatest instrumentalist. Let's forget jazz for one moment. Are you saying that Kenny G is better than Beethoven, Bach, Schoenberg, Bartok, or Stravinsky? Is he also better than John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis, Mike Oldfield? Face it, he's no better than all the thousands of faceless studio musicians. The Other review was from a girl who could not believe that an album could be based around a saxophone. I guess she was pretty young, and so, maybe one day she will realize the beauty of instrumental music. Anyway, don't buy this cd."
2,This is NOT jazz!,"I don't care what anyone says, this is not jazz music. It's not even remotely related to real jazz. What this actually is is dull, lukewarm adult-contemporary pop/soft rock that has turned doctors' office waiting rooms all over the country into torture chambers. I haven't bought any of kenny g's cds but I unfortunately know his music from being forced to listen to it in doctors/dentist's offices and in riding other peoples cars and hearing it on their tape or cd player. The biggest hits of Kenny G's career are the first three selections on this cd: ""songbird"", ""silhuette"", and ""forever in love"", but when I hear them I can't remember which is which even though I've heard them hundreds of times because all his music sounds the same. If you're a jazz fan DON'T BUY THIS CD! Get Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, George Shearing, or Stan Kenton. These artists make real jazz."
1,The Song Remains The Same,"I'm sorry, I do not understand all of the people who come to the defense of this man. He has not changed his tune much in the past fifteen years and is smug because CD buyers continue to support him. He is nowhere in the league of the true jazz artists. This is good is you like background music to weddings or need this kind of music to unwind after a long day at work. This is not my preference and it is my right to rate this CD with its single star."
1,Jazz Muzack,"To me, Kenny G is to jazz as Puff Daddy is to hip-hop. They both make mokeries of the music they are performing. Kenny G's songs are all the same old boring mush. His solos are slow and lack excitement and the music that accompanies his playing is about as interesting as a blank TV screen. If anyone would take the time to listen to saxophone greats such as John Coltrane and ""Cannonball"" Adderly, they'd become easily bored by Kenny's (lack of) talent. This is not jazz at all. Jazz is Miles Davis, Count Basie, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, and Dizzy Gillepse. They elevated jazz music just like The Roots and A Tribe Called Quest have elevated hip-hop. Do not support Kenny G who does not elevate or stay true to the artform of jazz. Spend you money on a true jazz great instead."
2,"Kenny G's not Satchmo, but he's no slouch eighther! Just dif","What a bunch of gimps you all are. It seems to me that if you don't like this mans music, then get off the site! DUH If the only reason you have to be here is to tear up the works of a man that has at least some hits, THEN GET A LIFE! Like anyone would listen to some hatefull, mindless fool that has nothing nice to say. There is enough of that in this world without wanna be's like you!"
4,"No Pulitzer Candidate, But Important Dynamic to Understand","If you're at all interested in global issues, then you need to understand (or at least consider) Dr Chua's premise regarding the interplay of free markets, democracy and market dominant ethnic minorities. After reading this book, you'll view many contemporary conflicts around the world in a whole new light. Dr Chua could have gotten her point across in less than half the pages, and more objective data instead of personal anecdotal evidence would have been nice. Nonetheless, the opportunity to be exposed to this theory is worth your investment."
2,Not practical or thorough enough,I think that a guide of this sort should be versatile in its searchability. I found this one to be difficult to explore.
2,Unimpressive,"Ambitious project, but doesn't quite measure-up to expectations. I struggled with this book and kept hoping I would get into the story and enjoy it...never gave up...but kinda wish I had. This would be a good book to pass on."
5,Unique,"OK, the choice of songs might be weird. There were a lot better ones by almost all the groups represented here. Also the way the CD's are organized is somehow not satisfying. But then again this is a sampler of Factory records, a label that was both fantastic and frustrating. New Order, Joy Division, The Happy Mondays, The Durutti Column and others are all here and it represents a very very strong collection of a very innovative and important label still. Some stuff is missing and there is also some unnecessary filler but that was Factory records actually."
1,A Fair Cover Photo Is The Nicest Thing I Have To Say...,"The sound quality here is atrocious. It sounds like someone recorded a officially released cd onto a cassette and then back on to cd for this release. The stereo almost seems fake and the songs seem to be playing at the wrong speed at times. Despite the price, avoid at all costs. Go for the major label releases instead. Yuck!"
4,A good start for Baxter,"For a first novel, Baxter has done a superb job of thinking about wht would happen in a scenario where gravity is one billion times greater than it is in our universe. Imagine each person having their own gravity field! I always like an SF book that is set in the future, but also hearkens back to the ""days of earth"" where humans originated and the ideas that come from that. As a physics teacher, I will find it interesting to have a discussion about this scenario and I hope to bring up this book in class.Baxter needs to work on some of his descriptive abilities, on the other hand. Granted, it may be my problem, but I was unable to picture some of the things he was trying to describe in the book and I think it lacked in being able to effectively describe what something looked like.All in all, this book has some great imaginative features, and Baxter is someone I am happy to read again."
3,Used Stephen Baxter paperback,The product was accurately described. Condition was fair. Delivery was in a timely manner.
2,meh,"I purchased the Boostaroo for use with a pair of Sennheiser HD280's. I primarily use the headphones with my PS3, but the PS3's default volume level isn't quite loud enough in some games. The Boostaroo definitely helps in this regard. However, there is some noticeable distortion introduced at medium to high volume levels. I also had to purchase a separate volume control since neither the audio source (PS3) nor the headphones feature a volume control.Pluses:-amplifies volume (duh)Minuses:-introduces some audio distortion at medium to high volume levels-no volume controlI'm probably gonna end up returning the Boostaroo and picking up one of those cmoy amps off e-bay instead."
2,"Not much of a ""boost""","I travel quite a bit and can't hear my movies with my laptop nor my smart phone on the plane due to the load drone of the engines. I'd hoped this would boost the sound enough to do so but no such luck. You get at the most another 20%. I'd say, not worth the price."
3,Samson myth,"Very scholarly, but too repetitive. I thought applying psychological motives a bit over the top. I expected it to be more like the CanonGate myths series. In short, more than I wanted to know."
3,The game isn't too bad. Multiplayer is the key feature.,"The game isn't too bad. Building the robots isn't too difficult when selecting parts and weapons. Control is good as well. However, single player tournament mode seems a bit short and doesn't really inspire you to want to play it again and again to try building different robots.However, multiplayer mode is what helps save the game. Playing against other people with their own designs in a multiplayer rumble is rather fun."
4,Great,"This game will be great! You will be able to play as some of the most favorite and well built bots! for once, the fans can actually take part in the battles without an actual bot! this game will be great for all battlebots fans"
3,Interesting,"I was really disapointed when i got this book, only because I thought I was getting the real wicca Bible. I payed good money for this book. I guess i'll know better next time i shop for books from you. FOOL ME ONCE, GET THE PICTURE. other than that the book is kind of ok."
5,Worth reading if you are searching.,This book is a must read even if you are not a wiccan or pagan. It portrays the feelings and true meaning of being Wiccan. A.J. stresses the point that this is only HIS oppinion and that EVERYONE should decide on their own if they agree. This is one of the few books that I have read that does not try to sway the reader to one point or another. It confirms that everyone has a right to their own decisions and beliefs. Highly suggested reading for anyone researching religions and want an accurate view of Wicca.
3,OK CD,"This was an okay CD, but not more than that. Berlioz is my favorite composer as well. The CD arrived in time, in good condition. Thanks!"
2,Awful!!!!!!,"I have not paid much attention to this singer and yesterday, on the way out of the music store, I grabbed a copy of this CD out of a display.The first tracks are excerpts from Les Troyens. Alagna is really out of his depths with this one. Why pretend he's Vickers or Heppner when he is just good enough for the church choir! It is TERRIBLE and it doesn't get better whith the rest of the CD. I'm not going to give any more attention to this CD, that's for sure.Alagna does not have the vocal heft for Énée nor are his renditions of the ""Benvenuto Cellini"" arias comparable to Nicolai Gedda's. Like his wife, Angela Gheorghiu, he is recording stuff he would NEVER be able to handle on stage. This is the worst form of studio trickery and should be frowned upon by all opera lovers. This practice of opera singers recording things that they would never be able to sing on stage is an outrage, especially in today's opera world!"
1,"Read Marlo Thomas' ""The Right Words at the Right Time""","I have read both this book and that authored by Marlo Thomas. Compared to Thomas' offering, this one is shallow and poorly edited. Some of the contributors offered up not one, but multiple people who changed their lives. The net result is a rambling of thank-you's and very little depth...very much like an acceptance speech at the Academy Awards."
4,"Very Pleased, BUT","This garden bench is everything I wanted and more. Its light grey, looks like the real thing and is a great addition to my newly landscaped area. I am very pleased, BUT, there are a few rough edges were the resin is not smooth. I had to reorder and to my surprise, the second bench was worse and the color was slightly different. I kept the first one and haven't seen a bench that tops it (even with a few rough edges)."
1,Out of date guide to Finale,"Publication date had not been included in the ad. I purchased it thinking it was relatively recent, but found it to be from 2002. Completely outdated information. Big rip-off. Item was sealed in new condition from Berklee press, but 10 years old."
4,nice but not what I hoped,"This is a good stick. I love the sheer foundation and thought this might be just the thing to cover slightly redder areas. It is nice, but not great. It tends to melt a bit."
1,Target changed the Baby Tad - I didnt get the one which I saw,"The image of the baby tad was different when I ordered. But when the shipment arrived after a long delay, it was not the one which was displayed. When I revisited amazon, they changed the image to current one. I wouldnt had ordered this baby tad, as I didnt like it.This one is not good as the other Baby Tad. Was a bad experience from amazon"
4,"Not quite as good as Dreamland, but a good one","It has a kindof' different type of music than Dreamland, but the music still captures you in its moods. A great one to own"
4,"Different from Dreamland, but definitely worth a listen","When I first listened to this CD, I expected to hear the danceable music similar to the well known ""Children"", and ""One and One"". What I heard were very beautiful, relaxing, moody ambient tracks. I quickly fell in love with this CD, and I've found it appropriate for listening no matter what kind of mood I'm in."
4,Pretty Darn good,"I liked this CD a lot, but I have to say not as much as Dreamland. I was so excited Robert Miles came and with a new CD then was dissapointed because it just wasn't the same... This one has too many vocal tracks and sounds similar to ORB but in a bad way. I love ORB but I want Robert Miles like Robert Miles, not like ORb."
1,Nothing like I was hoping for,"After ""Dreamland"", Robert Miles gave me an overwhelming disappointment with ""23AM"". Far too whiny for me. I'm seriously considering selling the album at a local CD exchange, if they will take it. Not a good experience."
3,"Different from Dreamland, but excellent.","This CD is very different from Dreamland, but it does give an in depth look at the more mellow and creative side of Robert Miles. He uses an excellent array of horn and guitar solos that just wouldn't be expected from him. He mixes them is such a way that it sounds awesome. I'm not a real big fan of mellow trance music, which 23AM is, but this album is excellent. There is one track, Full Moon, that is killer. I feel that Robert Miles should make all of his music like this track, but it's his diversity that makes him such a unique artist. I highly recommend this album to all Robert Miles fans who are open to change."
5,Amazing strings!,"These strings are some of the greatest round wound strings I've ever tried. They're super smooth, responsive, and create a nice, round, punchy sound. I've been playing them for quite a while with absolutely no signs of wear.Great buy!"
1,terrible feel to them,"although they look cool, they soung like crap. The tones are dull and the fingers do not slide very easily across the strings. I hope this review helps.."
5,Works wonders,I use this great product every time I hand wash and wax my classic cars. I recommend this product to everyone who washes their car.
2,Worked great the first few times,"It worked great the first few times, but stiffened and didn't absorb as well after a while. Maybe I didn't care for it properly, but if that's the case then it requires a lot of work."
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm glad bought this exact item through my local auto store on sale for $2.98. It does a VERY POOR job of absorbing moisture and is nothing like a true chamois cloth. Even after washing it in hopes of removing any residue, it still failed to perform. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, a cotton towel will do a better job. Mine is now in the garbage."
1,do not buy!,It was hard as a rock once I took it out of the container. Would not bend at all - not worth the money
5,Packed with insights,"Dominic Belmonte's TEACHING FROM THE DEEP END: SUCCEEDING WITH TODAY'S CLASSROOM ADVANTAGES appears in its second updated edition and uses the author's extensive teaching experiences to encourage new teachers to reflect on why they chose teaching and how to develop a teaching philosophy. From working with parents and colleagues to considering still moments in the classroom, this is packed with insights."
3,Made me feel good too,"I've appreciated Randy Crawfords way of singing ever since I got my first album, ""Raw Silk"" for christmas many years ago.A friend of mine, Geir Langslet, played the keyboards in the ""LAVA""-band, which accompanied miss/mrs Crawford on some of her tours in Norway.The ""Feeling good"" album means very pleasant listening, but lacks an obvious "" # 1 - hit """
3,what a fotographer does with this book?,"i thought this book would be 'revisited edition' of ""nikon and the nikkormat way"" -book from seventies. i hoped it contains updated data of new af lenses with more backround data and sizes, measures, weigths, quality etc. -but no. book just says that 'nikon doesn't make poor lenses'. on the other hand if you collect nikon stuff this is quite good book for recognising them, with photos of different versions and more."
1,Not as represented,"I live in Alaska and this isn't what I expected. The flashlight- no, the emergency candles are just tealights - come on I expected EMERGENCY candles, the first aid kit is a couple of wipes, a small role of tape and some bandaids - ok for a paper cut, the shovel is nice but not much good for anything more than planting a rose bush - we have feet of snow it will take hours to dig out with this. Need I go on. Not worth the money I spent for sure. I would not waste my time with this one."
3,Not the best but ok.,"Purchased this for a friend. reading the description it sounds alot bigger than it really is. No jumper cables, the strobe didnt work had to put in new batteries. shovel was kinda difficult to put together and flimsy. bag is just over stuffed. not easy to put things back into bag and close it once its opened."
4,Well thought out winter kit,"Purchased for our daughter, the kit contains just about everything that is necessary for saftey on the highway in winter. Matches couldn't be provided due to mailing restrictions, but that was easily remedied when the kit arrived."
2,Wii-Down,"When it comes to video game systems today, Nintendo is the company that has shown it has it all. With the return to console gaming on the Wii, many gamers are eager for looking for new ways to get their fix of action packed excitement. But, for Wii owners, they might feel the need of something else. This Widescreen 7"" game screen, works nicely for Gamecube gamers, who can also get their fix of Gamecube madness on the Wii, but it doesn't add up very well on anything else. Although it might be good if you're in a mobile home, but you unfortunately can't see very well on where you're aiming in games like The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. I really suggest you wait for either a bigger game screen, or just don't buy it at all. At about $200, it just misses the mark a lot.Price: DGameplay: C 1/2-Overall: D+"
2,"Bummer Eric, What Happened?","I actually read 1632 twice then sprung for the hardcover of 1633. Waited for the paperback of 1634 and what a downer. This rag joins the ranks of two books I quit in the middle in the last ten years. The other was Robert Jordan's ""Crossroads of Twilight"" adding the 1632 series to the heap of my worst literary disapointments.The things that made 1632 such a great opener for the series were all missing and replaced with really dull dialogue about stuff nobody outside a university history dept even cares about.Should have busted Galileo out of house arrest in the first 3 chapters and moved on to good stuff, leaving the hippies and venetian stooges behind."
1,Cure for Insomnia,"For huge fans of ""1632"" as I am, ""1634 - The Galileo Affair"" drifts far from the orignal flavor of ""1632"". Dry political, religious, and economic dialogues about philosophies and strategies of the period caused by the influence of Grantville, replace action and adventure. Absent from most of the book are the themes of 20th Century technology overcoming the 17th century villains. Sorry Mr. Flint. You had a great thing going, but you sure drifted away from it."
2,WHERE HAVE ALL THE WOMEN GONE?,"One of the more interesting things in the original book of the series, 1632, was the strength and intelligence shown by the female characters. Women often have little more than supporting roles in Fantasy Fiction unless, of course, the author is female. (Lackey, McCaffrey and Norton, et al.) Unfortunately, that trend did not hold true for this book and, to a lesser degree, the second in the series, 1633.The other thing that distinguishes this book from its parent is the sheer volume of details, subplots and historical lessons sandwiched into the plot. If you were attracted to the series because of its subject and balanced characterizations you would do well to stop after the first novel. If you are interested in the minutiae of historical interpretation without the taint of scholasticism, read on!"
2,Great potential; had to return due to ungodly hissing,"Terrible, loud hissing at volumes over 11. It is not slight or unnoticeable. It's loud. Extremely unfortunate because unit sounds great for a budget-combo unit (iPod + CD + radio). I would have kept the unit if I thought I could overlook the noise. I can't.Also, the CD door grinds while opening/closing, and it is not compatible to charge my iPod."
1,Faulty electronics; quits working.,"I bought this unit for use at work, as it had decent sound. However, it had a loud hissing sound at low volume levels. Sometimes it would freeze the ipod and I would have to let the ipod's battery drain before the ipod would come back on.Worst, I moved it from one outlet to another. After that, the power would never come back on, no matter what outlet I tried. It would only show this symbol on its display screen: "":"" or ""--:--"". It was receiving power because the ipod would charge, but it wouldn't do anything more than that. It didn't matter what button I pushed. The radio, CD, ipod, and clock would not work at all. I haven't tried customer service at Memorex yet, but since I bought this more than a year ago, I don't expect to get far based on the other reviews."
1,"Ugh. I""m returning this.","After a very shallow description of the types of resorts, and a plea for developers to be more sensitive to the natural environment, the book glosses over the huge planning phase and goes into how to turn a profit once the doors are open. All of the steps in between are dismissed with the understanding that you'll hire various teams of professionals to handle them. But THAT's what I wanted to know!"
1,Sentimental tripe,"This is sentimental tripe -- a yuppie's nostalgia for a pre-gentrified city. As for the Amazon.com reviewer who prefers this rubbish to the amazing Ric Burns series or to anything by Studs Turkel -- all I can say is, buddy, you're not a real New Yorker."
5,The SWITCH sizzles!,"Sean is a handsome Alpha male, a former Special Forces warrior, and the father of a teenaged son. He also has a secret: He's a Switch, a man with fantasies about submitting to a beautiful woman -- or, conversely, dominating her. When he meets beautiful Beth, he realizes she's the woman of his dreams. Despite her Asian heritage, Beth loves to play dominant in the bedroom. When the two get together, the result is steamy passion-- but more than that, their relationship quickly blooms into a sweetly passionate romance.Whiteside's writing shines in this story. You'll love it!"
3,Hawkwind - 'Quark' four track CD-single (Griffin),"Do keep in mind that this IS,in fact a four track CD single,it is NOT the actual disc 'Quark Stangeness&Charm'.It does have the title cut from THAT lp,as well as two mixes of ""Uncle Sam's On Mars"" as I really liked the Martian Conquest Mix as well as the ten-minute unreleased tune ""Black Sun"",which is exclusive to this single.For big-time Hawkfans ONLY.Line-up appears to be Brock,Alan Davey and Richard Chadwick.More or less JUST another disc to add to your already extensive Hawkwind collection."
1,It's just a bag of corn!,"Corn is the number 1 ingredient. If I wanted to feed my dogs corn, I would have went to Wal-mart and grabbed a bag of Ol' Roy. My dogs refused to eat this ""vet recommended"" crap ."
2,Book club,This book is so hard to get through. I gave up. But others in my book club who finished it said the second half was much easier to read than the first half.
5,Excellent reading.,I found this story very entertaining and well written.Owen Meany is a wonderful person that I found completely facinating.
1,This book is boring and Childish,"I find this book boring and childish ...not to mention bigotted and insulting ... it celebrates perversity ... It is full of obscenity, and inappropriate sexual commentary involving teenagers ... and it has no redeeming literary value ... unless you are the most extreme left-wing liberal, who hates Christians, and Republicans like Ronald Reagan ...The book's primary theme seems to be to mock Christians and Republicans, and is only ""humourous"" in a perverse way ..."
3,Great beginning disolves into PC babble by the end,"If you only read the first half or two thirds of this book, it will be one of the most enjoyable books you read this year. A Prayer for Owen Meany is laugh out loud hilarious through its first half as it brings back the anguish and triumphs of growing up. However, Owen Meany's pains are darker and more tortured than most readers are likely to have experienced.While I could not put the book down in the first half, I had to force myself to continue to the end as the book becomes boring and preachy as it draws to a close. I was praying that Owen's mission would somehow involve the sudden death of the narrator. Believe me by the end of the book you feel his pain."
5,heartbreaking,"The tale of Owen and John brings to our dark, narrow field of vision a sweet glimmer of transcendence, of an eternity that is perhaps incomprehensible but ultimately caring. This is a marvelous and painful rumination on fate, certainly one of the most powerful stories I've ever read. The final page will leave you in tears, wishing for Owen's bright return to a disordered earth. Lovely."
5,Irving's Masterpiece,"I had read other of Irving's books, and though they were well-crafted, filled with understated humor and zany characters, I would not have expected one of his books to wind up near the top of my all-time favorite list. Owen Meany is unforgettable, it is bound to have any literate person laughing and crying. It is also bound to stump those who like to categorize: is it a comedy, a tragedy, a mystery novel? Is is religious, psychological, political? Is the ending a victory or a tragedy? This one is as hard to put down as a best selling thriller, yet it will leave you more fulfilled and thoughtful."
2,"Powerful writing, but too much naive politics","John Irving is a powerful writer, and in A Prayer for OwenMeany he has created an endearing, unforgettable character in Owen.This novel is insightful and poignant, and offers many sharp and funny observations of life in a small New England town and in a private boys' academy. But Irving doesn't settle for this. He also adds left-of-left political commentary that is jarringly out of place in an otherwise lovely book. Irving's venomous politics badly mar his novel, making many pages of the book seem like a naive, windy polemic."
4,"I good book, that I liked a lot","I liked the characters in this book a lot. They developed into mature pesons during my reading, and they humored me in a good feeling way. I tried to tread one of Irwing books when I was young, but could not stand it. Now I am older and realy enjoyd this."
5,A book for all,"A Prayer for Owen Meany is my favorite novel. This is a book that I think should be included on many more reading lists in college and even high schools. Irving has an uncanny way of getting into the meat of all his characters. Even when you don't completly understand where the story is heading you can be assured that it is going to all come together at one point, and fully transport you into his world. This is an easy enough read, but one with life long lessons inside."
4,More than Scarlet,"I've just finished Owen Meany and have been mourning the end of the book at the office all day...This is a great and easy read. Please dive in. Many of the previous reviews have touched on Irving's allusions to Hawthorne's THE SCARLET LETTER which is certainly accurate. But this book is NOT about Hester Prynn. It's about FAITH. Regardless of your religion of choice or lack thereof, Irving builds on questions of faith and doubt throughout the novel which are essential for anyone struggling to understanding LIFE. God? Fate? Motivation? Chance? Divine Plan? Christianity aside, Irving weaves a wonderful modern myth which is difficult to put down. One more thing, my use of capital letters had nothing to do with Owen. Really. I think."
2,A Prayer for this book to end.,"While I appreciate the carnival atmosphere that John Irving loves to portray in his storytelling, it wasn't enough to save Owen Meany for me. After all the hype surrounding this story, I was expecting something a little more entertaining and a little less preachy. Throughout the book I felt as if Irving were trying to convince the reader to believe in a story that wasn't believable. And with over six hundred pages to convince me, the only thing I began to believe was that the book was not worth reading."
2,A very slow prayer,"I expected to love A Prayer for Owen Meany. The World According to Garp and Hotel New Hampshire were both terrific books. My book club members recommended it highly. But I didn't love it. The book reads very slowly. It's like wading through quicksand except you don't sink; you just fall asleep while reading. The premise is interesting but it is nowhere near the ""classic"" I expected. The book simply isn't what I expected. There are no great epiphanies, no wonderful moments. The reader just slogs through as the book moves ever so slowly to the expected climax."
1,reasons,"I gave A Prayer for Owen Meany 1 star so that you'd read my review. There are so many 5 star ones that you tend to skip over them because they all say the same thing. Something different stands out, for instance; TYPING IN CAPS. hence, my rating. I loved the book and couldn't put it down. Truly thought provoking, but also hysterical and fun to read. Owen is a spiritual figure, but human enough to be a little more believable. Read it. It's sparked many discussions in my group of friends, who've all recently had the privelege of being forced to read it for class. You'll find yourself relating it to everything that happens and wondering what the purposes of your actions are. This wondering will help you to realize and give you more direction in the cloudier areas of your life. I hope you'll enjoy it in the way I did. 5 stars."
3,Eany Meany Miney Owen,"The character Owen Meany is great (especially in the early years), the story is good, but it is about a hundred pages or so too long. I just found myself wishing it would move faster. There are places where we divert from the main story for all this description of minor characters that just isn't necessary and it weighs the story down. But overall, I liked it."
2,Really?,"Way to long. This author seems to hate the United States, Ronald Reagan, those who fought in the Vietnam War, etc. Some parts of this book I liked, others I didn't. The author rambles on about things that don't pertain to the book. Was not impressed."
1,Bad,"This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life and I would never read it again even if the fate of earth depended on it. The only positive comment I have on this book is the ending; the book is so long and unnecessarily detailed that just knowing you're nearing the end is the only pleasure I can see that the reader could get out of this book. The characters, setting, and overall plot are unoriginal in the sense that they all seem to reflect upon much of the author's life."
5,The Best of Irving,Owen Meany is by far the best of John Irving's novels. Irving is a master at drawing the reader into the story and this is no exception. The reader is introduced to the seemingly strange Owen and soon falls in love with him. He becomes the unlikely leader and VOICE of those who know him best. Everyone should know someone like Owen. He knows himself and forces those around him to look at themselves and their fates. I did not want the story to come to an end. I have read A Prayer for Owen Meany several times.
5,Why do the world's best two writers live in the same place?,"I read Owen Meany when it was first published, actually before it was published, as I had managed to get my grubby paws on an uncorrected book proof. It remains the only book to have made me cry - yes tears actually came to the eyes. If you haven't read this book - YOU HAVE TO. ""Cider House Rules"" is also brill, although I found his latest offering ""Son of a circus"" a bit drawn out and compared to Owen Meany and Cider House - a bit disapointing. P.S. The OTHER author is Stephen King"
1,Not recommended,"Did not hold my interest. Very drawn out without enough of a plot or story.Prefer action to this. Some parts were ineresting, although found that skipping parts to look for the story wasn't much better so quit reading altogether. Some friends have felt the same way."
3,A litte disapointed,"This book was fun to read. The people are so believable, and so real which is what I loved most about the book. I could find Owen's sacrifice much more believable if the author hadn't paid so much attention to ridiculing religion in general. I did go away from this book with a since of loss, because I became attached to Owen and his personality, he just grows on you so. I was sad to see how Johnny becomes so ambivilant that he has let Owen's sacrifice and the world pass him by instead of concentrating on the joys of really living."
4,a joy to read,"This is the kind of book to read when you feel like things aren't so great. It renews hope and it makes you feel like you're part of something bigger -- that everything happens for a reason. It's just a little bit of inspiration, which is why it's so special. Give it to someone you care about so they can have wonderful memories too."
4,Mean to women but it shines in depiction of selfless love,"OK, first the bad stuff. As in Garp, John Irving wants women to be either sluts or saints. Cousin Hester lives with Owen in a relationship that is never fully clarified, and she carries on his memory in her rock videos by living up to the name given to her by her brothers: Hester the Molester. Well, that's one female character. The other one, Joe's mother, is admittedly a mixture of the two extremes, but she is only described from a distance, mostly after her death, and it's not clear who she really was.The good: this is a very poweful, funny, creepy and deeply moving book. I'm not big on stories about religious figures nor am I fond of prep schools, but Irving brings both these elements to life.I was trying to describe this book in the briefest way to a friend and I broke down when I thought of the ending. Like the narrator, I will never forget Owen."
5,This book forces you to search your soul for your own truths,"A Prayer For Owen Meany is one I will never forget and will always cherish. I have read it once a year now for the past seven years and each time I laugh and cry until I feel sick. Everytime I read it, the end always tears me apart. ... Irving perfectly captures the image--physical and spiritual, of Owen. I am able to visualize what he looks like and I can even ""hear"" his voice. Each time I read the book I learn something new about life and fate and how each of us has a purpose and a reason for being alive. This book has pulled me up several times and it will continue to do so until the day I die. It definitely makes me think long and hard about the life I lead. Bravo to Irving. I look forward to reading other books of his"
5,How did the author think this up?,"I read the first and second halves of this book more than a year apart (due to the interruption of childbirth and its aftermath). I had enjoyed the beginning so much that I never forgot about it and picked it up as soon as I could, right in the middle where I had left off. Wow. I mean, WOW! I really loved this book. More than the basic plot, I was amazed by all the stories within the story that gave life to the characters, to the ""love"" story between two best pals. The story was masterfully crafted, every part having a purpose. It was the most creative book I can remember reading in a long time."
4,A prayer for Owen Meany,"I read A prayer for Owen Meany for an English class. At first, I was intimidated by the book's length because I didn't have much time to read it. I decided I'd give it a try. The book started off very slowly, giving boring background information. I was bored and thought about choosing a different book, but I thought it would probably get better as the novel progressed, and it did. Once the story really started taking shape, I was intrigued. A prayer for Owen Meany is the story of two boys growing up together. John Irving did a great job making believable and lovable characters. once I got to know each character, i couldn't stop reading. After the first chapter, I absolutely loved the book. Irving did an excellent job of making both a great plot and wonderful characters. Although the book does not have a captivating beginning, I loved it and feel it is definitely worth reading."
5,Review of A Prayer For Owen Meany,"This is the second time I've read this book. I loved the writing and the story. The title may give the impression that it's a religious book but, it's not. There's nothing like a book that can make you cry and laugh."
5,"This is my favorite book of all time, bar none.","The first time I read this book, I thought it was about Owen Meany. I loved it. I laughed out loud until tears rolled down my cheeks, and then I cried like a baby. The second time I read this book I realized that it is really the narrator's story. And I loved it more. I still laughed. I still cried. (Note to the person below who mentioned that the Toronto segments were not necessary--read it again. They are!) This story is brilliant on many, many levels. I know I will read this book time and time again throughout my life. I recommend it above all others. (See the ParentsPlace.com book club archives for a great discussion on this book!)"
4,Wonderful reading,"As a fan of John Irving, I had picked up Owen Meany several times only to put it down again because I'm not religious and the thought of reading a book about god and faith was not enticing. When I picked it up this final time and started it, I couldn't put it down. I didn't want it to end. I was laughing out loud throughout the novel and was teary eyed at the end. You don't need to believe in god in order to fall in love with Owen Meany. Another masterpiece by John Irving, although I didn't think the ""Toronto"" segments were necessary or even enhancing to the book."
5,The best book I will ever read!,"I have just finished reading ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" as an English assignment for school. I absolutely loved the book, and Owen Meany. I keep expecting to see him at the gym practicing ""the move,"" or at the airport, waiting for those ""penguins"" to show up. Owen Meany has touched my heart, and will not soon be forgoten."
5,My Favorite Novel - EVER!,"Words cannot express how I feel about this book. Irving's characters are so quirky and bizarre, yet I believe wholeheartedly in, and fall in love with every one of them. I was hooked from the first paragraph. The new film ""Simon Birch"" is based on this book. I fear no movie can ever do it justice."
4,If it wasn't for my bookclub - I would never have read this!,"If you can get through the first two chapters without giving up, and through the religious stuff, this book is first rate. I really disliked the capitalized letters in which Owen spoke; however, THAT is Owen. Bigger than life with a lot of insights. The last chapter or so tied all the loose ends together. Great read. I have passed the book on!!"
4,A modern day Romeo and Juliet,"You know the story. Two families have hated each other all their lives, and continue the tradition by raising their children to hate each other. However, the children meet, not knowing the other is their enemy, and fall in love. It's a fresh spin on it- Kait starts a new school and feeling overwhelmed, spends her time writing in her journal. But who should she meet but a boy named Bram who also likes to spend his time in the shade, quietly drawing. The two are drawn to each other and all is going well until Kait finds out who he really is. Can their love overcome their family history? You'll have to read to find out!Overall it's a cute story, and though I don't expect one, I'd love to see a sequel. There are a lot of loose ends still laying around when the story finishes and I'd like to see what else could happen in Kait and Bram's lives."
3,Didn't do it for me...,"Ok, I'm not really into romances, but I read this, and it didn't do it for me. I struggled to get through the books. The main character in this story seems really stupid to me, writing silly poems in her ""secret"" book. I don't like how the author describes the events in the story. It had a good plot, though.Try Gone with the Wind, an excellent romance."
4,If you're a train buff and interested this is interesting to watch.,"My favorite route of all of Amtrak's long distance trains. Could be better, but gives an idea of the train and the route though parts are old and no longer true."
5,Great Tools for a Great Price,I was extremely pleased how fast this tool kit arrived after I ordered it. There was no better price on the web and this kit rated the highest on Consumer Reports (.org) so I am confident that this kit will serve me well and dutifully. I haven't had a chance to break the set in but all of the tools and batteries were fine in working order. My only complaint is that the canvass bag that was included had a zipper that is in need of repair because it wasn't attached correctly to the bag. This is a minor problem and I don't consider it to be significant enough to even warrant less than a five star review. I am very excited.
2,For Babylon 5 Fans,"It seems that everyone who likes this CD liked the TV show first, but I was a Chris Franke fan before B5 (which I didn't watch too much), so my review is of the MUSIC. Frankly (no pun intended), it's weak. Since leaving Tangerine Dream, Franke has added an orchestra to his electronic sound, and it gets in the way on this CD (The first B5 release is better). I guess I won't know how the rest of the B5 albums sound, since this one was so disappointing. Electronic music lovers should start with KLEMania. Chris Franke fans in general should gauge how much they like the TV show before investing in this."
2,Weak depth of character,"I was not expecting anything from this book, though I loved Madam Bovary. The problem with the character, Salambo, a temple girl, is that she was missing in action. Instead, the author uses the title as a pretense to explore and describe ancient Carthage, and gives us little opportunity to know the main characters. Salambo says a few vague lines and then she's off, usually in a huff over her father, then Flaubert starts his travelogue on Carthage again, panning the lens around. If you love sheer exotic scenery then you might like this story--but if you also want memorable characters, this is not the book."
3,No Difference,"I have only been taking this sporadically....not consistently. So I can't really say whether effective or not over long term.I will continue to take it. If a noticeable change occurs, will re-write review upon next order."
5,philosophy belongs to everyone,"Rather than a give the story of philosophy in 50 pages, Dr. McInerny points students of philosophy in a direction such that their philosophical studies might actually benefit their lives. The book is thus a defense of perennial philosophy, and the classical view that philosophy is something humans are ""naturally"" drawn to do, because it completes our lives. Dr. McInerny engages the reader in argument, as he defends this view against modern views of philosophy, and discusses the nature of certainty, common sense, and the role of science. Its most important value is the great faith in human intellect and reason, implicit throughout the book. This book would make a good beginning for college philosophy classes. A concluding bibliographical appendix by Joshua Hochschild gives a brief overview of main philosophers throughout history, and some good suggestions for reading."
1,I Can't Give This Zero Stars,"I am a professional military historian who used to appear in commercial videos like this one. They're all pretty lame, but this is just crap, the worst I've ever seen. Trust nothing it says or shows, and the film quality is awful."
4,Beautiful,"I've never really been into American Alternate Music before, but I don't like to limit my taste in music and when I heard ""Don't I Hold You"" single once on BBC Radio 1 I was transfixed. I bugged my dad for ages to help me find it hoping that the album would be as good as that single. It was! The fantasic guitar chords and beautiful words totally infiltrated my brain! The single ""Don't I Hold You "" is one of the most moving tunes I've heard (along side ""Iris"" by Goo Goo Dolls). Believe me if you're a girl at ""that time of the month"" you won't be able to stop crying for hours. It's haunting. ""And Someone with Strength"", ""Body Talk"" (parts 1 and 2) are fantasic examples of well written songs. Only god knows why ""Wheat"" haven't been promoted enough in England..they deserve more notice and recognition in the UK."
2,CAUTION!!! -mix well before serving-,"Out of all her albums I wouldnt say that this is her best bc of one small, but very critical problem. With the exception of a few moments, everytime she mixes from one song to another, its off just by a hair. It drives me nuts. On her ""live in ibiza"" cd, every song is mixed perfectly. What happend this time? This really takes away from the entire cd. I couldnt belive the beat matching was as poor as it was at times from a superstar dj. But to be there in person was probably a diferent story. Other than that, track slection was massive and had the classic irene sound. So it falls victim to 2 stars on account of busted pitch faders!"
5,The Daughter of Rosie O'Grady,"areAnother lovely musical, very much a great follow-on from Look for the Silver Lining, these type of films never date, and are always well worth buying. GREAT FILM."
4,love the table,"I love this table. I have a small apartment and this table works great! I never needed to buy the chairs, I already have chairs."
5,Boss LS2 Line selector,"For little amps with no channel selector switch this is a must, it allows me to take out the distortion and leave my clean sound just like switching channels on an amp, for my little practice amps is a life saver, I don't even have to spend extra on a switch for my Mustang I, the LS2 works just fine."
3,essential reading for Star Wars fans of all ages,"I'm 25, and although these books are written for younger readers, they are superior to many of the other Star Wars books with their psychological focus. Watson carefully traces Obi-Wan's and Anakin's development together, and captures the essence of the Jedi spirit. Approving this series and the Jedi Apprentice one was a great move by Lucas. I recommend that every serious Star Wars fan read each of these short books, as they flesh out key characters tremendously well.Unfortunately, saber color and hilt design is a major problem on the covers of these books. _The Way of the Apprentice_ has Anakin holding a blue lightsaber (which is right), but the hilt is from Qui-Gon's GREEN saber. In the background, the girl on the left is holding Obi-Wan's blue saber. Careless illustration.Verdict: ignore the lightsabers on the covers, but revel in the excellent character development."
1,Total Junk,"It is bulky, ugly and useless. I sent mine back to tv boys, or whatever their name was, even though they charged me return shipping and acted like they were doing me a favor."
3,Ruby Ring of Looove!,"Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb"" came to mind at first glance. But the light vibrations of this device were not to be frowned upon. I like the shape and bright color of the device. And its jelly grip was ""just right"" for me. I am in the bigger class of men, and I treat toys as toys and usually give them little credit. Most I imagine getting in the way or overpowering the moment, but if properly introduced, this little guy can send you on a Lord of the Rings fantasy all night long. <my precious>"
1,Lot's of sun in AZ,"I've been using this for a few weeks and have noticed no difference at all. Since I'm in my mid-40's, I'm very careful about not getting too much sun and always wear sunglasses and a hat. This product didn't seem to help my wrinkles at all."
3,nothing special,I am always on the lookout for a great eye cream as I get older. This product is nothing special and it seems that for the money Olay should have put the product in a tube instead of the individual Derma Pods. You are paying for the packaging more than the product. The product is ok but nothing exceptional. I think that Olay's Regenerist under eye roller is a better product and more soothing and also reduces puffiness as well.
4,Great product,"I was a little hesitant at purchasing these the first time. I really enjoy this product. The only thing I do not like is the delivery system. While it works, I would find it much more functional if you could just buy a tube of this and use your own applicator or finger. The cream itself is wonderful and you will notice a small difference even after only one use. When used over time with proper skincare it definitely makes a larger impact. I would recommend these to anyone looking to find an affordable way to tighten up the eye area. Thanks Olay :)"
3,Eye Refresh,Very light eye moisturizer in small compact dispensers good for travel. Minimal cream in each container
3,Loved it for awhile,"When we first got this stroller I loved it. It was perfect for 2 kids, at the time aged 3 yrs and 6 months. Now that we have had it for a year, however, I am increasingly disappointed. It seems that the bigger the kids get the harder it is to steer the stroller. Even when there is only one kid in it. Not only that but it squeaks. We have WD-40'd the stroller but it still squeaks. So now I have a squeaky stroller that no longer turns on a dime. I doubt it would even turn on a...I don't know, something much bigger than a dime anyway. In short it was great when it was new, but now that it has been used a lot, it sucks. If I could go back in time I would have bought a different one."
5,Best Stroller!,"We just received our stroller and I absolutely LOVE it! I have a Scion (really small car), which has a hatch back so I was really concerned about finding a double stroller that would fit. Once we assembled the stroller we put it in the car and were amazed! It takes up less space than my Graco single stroller does (they only thing I have to do is remove the canopy but the fact that it fits I'm ok with that!). I wish I had known about this stroller when I was pregnant with my first because I would have just bought this one then and not purchased the single one. If you are planning on having more than one child I wouldn't waste my money on a single stroller I would just go ahead and purchase this one. This was the best gift we have received and we are so happy with this stroller."
2,Not the best option for 2 different aged children,"We bought this stroller as a 2nd stroller to keep in the car. We live in a city and have a primary stroller for every day use so this stroller did not meet our needs for several reasons. We have a 2 1/2 yr old & a 2 month old.*When using the extender for the infant car seat it is actually over 50"" folded despite what the dimensions read on the description and it didn't fit in our trunk.*When using it with a car seat in the front you have to recline the front seat & it makes it very uncomfortable for your toddler to sit on back seat (you can see this in the pics). So it is not the best option when using it for a toddler & an infant.*You also have to put the car seat in the front & I would prefer to have my infant closer to me than in the front of the stroller so after much comparing of these type of strollers we found that the BabyTrend Sit N Stand Ultra is actually a better choice cause it gives you this option. Its much more versatile."
2,not so hot so,"this is, i am sure, a perfectly helpful book across the pond. in america, especally the upper midwest not so much. the measurements are off and the ingredients are not readily available fresh or frozen. very few recipes i can use. some interesting ideas tho."
2,Useless,"Replaced one of my DIR-625 router omni-directionals with this, carried my signal strength meter around the house and saw absolutely no change. Still looking for a solution."
1,Didn't work !,"I put this device directly on top of my wireless laptop and the signal meter read 2 bars out of 5 ! Needless to say, I had to send it back. My advice, keep looking, I am."
5,Lost Planet...5 Stars Easily,"I bought this game and played it all the way through on single player and it was about a 4/5 star game. It has great graphics, great gameplay but needed something else. Well then I played multiplayer on Xbox Live and this should have a 10 star rating, this is by far the best online gameplay of any game I have played to date, even better than Gears of War."
5,Emergency Road Assistance Kit,This was a gift for Christmas and was exactly what I was looking for as a gift. All in good order and recieved on time.
4,"they love it, but my son noticed.....","that they dont show one of the trains that is showing on the case.....he was waiting to see it but it didnt show......other then that, great! They love all the mighty machines"
5,Great DvD Series!,"I found this by accident on Netflix. Since then my 3 year old son and 2 year old daughter cannot get enough so I finally purchased their own Dvds. Its a great hit! Now everytime we out they name all the machines, cars, and trucks they see along with the colors! This is great for all toddlers boys and girls!"
2,It was the same story.,"The origional song was good as a song, but to me there was only one different story in the whole book. The rest were the same with different names."
4,nice add-on,"Nice add-on that fits the K10D perfect. makes it looks more like a pro camera. :-)However, doesn't make it better or the other way. I should saved it for a DA* lens."
2,Downer,"I really thought this would be a clever and well crafted expose on the business practices of huge companies like McDonalds. Instead I watched a really depressing movie about the use of illegal aliens in meat packing places that supply the fast food chains. Despite a bevy of guest stars, the movie is really not very captivating and not nearly as clever as it should be. I really did not enjoy this one. There is a good message and a strong warning involved, but it would have made a better documentary than a feature length film."
2,Not a great documentary as I hope for,"I should of just read the book instead. Judging from some reviews, the book seems to be a lot better than the movie. The movie just seems fake to me because I wasn't presented with new surprising facts about the how fast food restaurant operates. I thought I would be getting some movie similar to Sicko and Supersize Me. The movie makes me feel like they are trying to connect two movie into one but fail to do that. If you are looking for a good documentary on the corruptions and evil doing of fast food restaurant, I think you will be disappointed."
3,I bit horrifying...but ok...read my review,"Ok, so I bought this movie b/c I don't eat burgers, fries, ect....any fast food would be Subway...b/c I can WATCH them make the food...and now I have more of reason than ever...when that kid SPIT in the food, I freaked...I mean I know this stuff happens, but still!!My problems w/ this movie are that some parts are very boring. Too much talking, and not enough action...I did NOT care for the sexual parts, there was no need to put pure sex w/ nudity in this movie...it served NO purpose to the meaning of this film.It does make me think twice though...I had no idea how awful the slaughter houses were, and what the cows go through...that was disturbing, and I was bothered....I felt strange for the rest of the night, and wish I would have never watched the movie....it's a movie I would sell or give away in a heart beat. I plan to NEVER watch it again.If you have $12 you want to spend on a DVD...find something else to spend it on...."
4,Food for Thought,"It can't be easy to make a film about the fast food industry without coming across as preachy or judgmental, but ""Fast Food Nation"" does just that. The film does a good job of showcasing a diverse array of characters who are involved in the fast food industry on a variety of levels; from high school student cashiers, to an upper level marketing executive, to illegal immigrants working in the meat packing plant. It helps that an impressive level of acting talent was engaged for the film (including Patricia Arquette, Bruce Willis, Greg Kinnear, and Wilmer Valderrama, who is somehow far less annoying when he's speaking in Spanish), and the talent all helps to flesh out characters that could easily have come across as two dimensional. Each character, although superficially different, is each depicted as a person doing their best to survive in society, despite their reservations about their job or the industry they work in. Is there anyone who can't relate to that?"
5,Fast Food Nation,"Fast Food Nation was a good movie.. I enjoyed watching my cousin Lou Taylor Pucci in it he is really becoming a great actor.. I have worked in the fast food business since I was 16 up until 8 years ago and this movie really hits home lol , I thought it was very well done....."
2,Not worth the rental price,I like to watch documentaries on the food industry and how our food is processed. Someone told me to watch this one as it gives a look at the meat processing area. I think they movie could have done more to show how the dirty side of the processing plants. This movie was too much about the illegal immigrants and supervisor taking advantage of them. Really didn't feel it was worth the rental price. Have seen much better. Unless it comes up on the free prime list wouldn't spend the money on renting it.
1,Terrible,"This was by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't waste your time or money! I truly enjoyed the book, but the movie really had nothing to do with the book. The topic of ""poopy"" burgers was hardly addressed as the whole movie revolved around illegal immigrants. It was full of propaganda and rather un-American."
1,Disasterous - the only word I have for it!,"It is hard to say why this movie is as bad as it is! You take a tremendous book, that will make everyone think twice before going to a burger joint again, add some decent actors, and accomplish nothing but a deplorable movie. If they would have read from the book for two hours it would have been better. The story goes nowhere, the message lost among random thoughts, the plots non-existing to intermingling. My advice - Read Eric Schlosser's book and save your money on the movie."
5,great,"Works very well in the shop. Would buy more if needed, Very easy to install and they stay in place well."
2,just so so,some of the peg hooks should be a little longer on the back (the part that goes into the peg board) because they fall out
4,informative movie with cool facts,"Good movie- definitely worth the time it took to watch it. Interesting perspectives on ""black names"" associated with fewer call backs for jobs, how abortion legalization in 1973 may be associated with drop in crime in the 1990s, and how real estate agents recommend selling houses 10 days earlier on average(for less money) than they sell their own houses because of the economic incentives influencing them. Cool movie."
3,The song's fine but..,"after a few days or even two weeks, you'll get really sick of it. I mean, i've been hearing the song in radios getting non-stop airplay all the time, my sister repeating the song over and over again. I don't regret that I bought it but I don't think it's gonna be very long before most people get sick of it."
2,I used the cups several times for short ...,"I used the cups several times for short amounts of time. The fit was semi-correct and as far as comfort, I couldn't tell I was wearing it at all. Even though I wore the cup for only a short period of time there was some slight leaking. I recommend it if you're looking to be """"intimate"""" during a time you usually may not want to. I don't recommend it for long term feminine protection."
5,It just can't get any better,"This is a must have album if you like dance music. There are very few compilations of greatest hits as good as this one. This is all you need in 1 cd from one of the greatests eurodance groups ever. From track 1 to 16, 2 unlimited will rock you with their catchy beat, great vocal and cool rap. Unfortunately, the original members of the group are gone, and current 2 unlimited mustered up only a few good songs that just remind you of their glory past. 2 unlimited was one of the pioneers of eurodance and will always be remembered as one of the greatest euro groups."
2,No subtitles or CC,"I love Eddie Izzard and I own all of his other DVD's. But, my husband is slightly hard of hearing and the sound of this production is not the best. Unlike all the other DVD's there are no subtitles or closed captions. It looks like they put a lot of money and effort into this production, why couldn't the spend the extra couple of $ to put subtitles on it? It makes very me angry at the production company and sad to not be able to enjoy the show."
5,True Horror,"What provoked me to rate the film and write a review was the undeserved and misleading two-and-a-half star rating. Put simply, this isn't Hollywood horror, and that seems to be the movie that so many of those who wrote negative reviews were expecting. This is something much more sophisticated and terrifying, an exploration of loss, trust and betrayal, self-doubt, and so much more. And that's to say nothing of the overwhelming atmosphere, the mesmerizing imagery, the total immersion. Turn off the phones, the lights, and tune out every other distraction. Don't talk. This is film horror at its best and something to be experienced, not just watched."
3,Hi am Tom H THE BIGGEST BLINK FAN OUT THERE!,"Okay now that Austin Gibbons guy who wrote a revew was wrong! he said that Tom was the bass guy, mark was the guitarest!!! come on! if he was a real fan he would know it was the other way a-round. But it's okay, i guess he tryed his best. Now to the book. The book wasn't that great, i meen some of it was taken from BLINK 182's video they made. If you were me i'de only get this book if you wanted to get all the BLINK 182 stuff there is. Well this is Tom saying so long and good bye..."
1,Why are two Moms always a problem?,"Why are two Moms always presented as a problem? I have an 11 year old son and a 6 year old daughter. In Kindergarten neither of them even had the concept that having two Moms was bad or that one or the other of us was or was not their real Mom. I sure don't want to introduce those ideas thru a childrens book. Sure, kids have asked how you can have two Moms or do you have a Dad? But they are not so mean about it as presented in this book. Even though it all turns out well in the end, I wouldn't want to read the first half of the book to my daughter. It's time for a book for kids where there are two Moms, but that fact is just incidental to the story -- not the problem to be dealt with."
3,"Good, movie, not good quality dvd","My husband has been looking for this movie forever. I ordered it and the dvd skips alot, even after being cleaned. It was okay for the price, but I was slightly disappointed in the product's quality."
3,"It Was Pretty Good, Entertaining","I agree with Kurupt: If you've seen ""You've Got Served"" and/or ""Drumline"" then you've already seen ""Stomp The Yard."" The plots are very similiar. And if you've seen ""ATL"" and remember the conflict with NuNu and her father, you'll find a similiar conflict with Megan Good's character and her father in this movie. Other than that the music was just okay and the dancing was great- it was like watching a music video. The only similarities ""STY"" has with ""School Daze"" is that both deal with fraternities on HBCU campuses and that's pretty much it; ""School Daze"" has more depth to it.Overall, ""STY"" is a fun, entertaining movie geared towards the younger crowd. Even though Chris Brown wasn't in the movie for long, he did a good job and I'd like to see him in more movies."
5,No complaints. .,"I purchased this movie for my daughter and it arrived relatively fast and in the condition specified. She's very happy with it, which means I am too!"
3,Not a live album,"This is a good compilation album, but the title is ""Zappa on the Radio"", not ""Zappa on the Road"", and the tracks are all taken from previously released albums. Some of the tracks were recorded live, but I'd have been disappointed if I bought this thinking it was a live concert recording. Oh, wait, I *was* disappointed because I had thought it was a live concert recording. I don't regret buying it, though; I love the packaging."
2,Brown Rice Cakes,"Unfortunately, most of the rice cakes in the carton were broken. Taste was good, but crumbly rice cakes left much to be desired."
3,Avoid if you are allergic to CORN,"I avoid glutinous grains and corn, but enjoy eating brown rice. I had an allergic reaction to these rice cakes. I wasn't sure what could've caused it. I contacted Lundberg and found out that they process the rice cakes on the same equipment they use for their other products that contain corn. I think I may have also reacted to the flavorings they use in the other rice cakes. I will not buy again."
3,superb,"The way Mr.Nance has presented the network concepts is simply superb.I also tried out some of concepts mentioned by him but I have a problem in it. I actually wanted to directly write a e-mail to Mr. Nance but I don't know is e-mail id. The problem is that my message gets routed only to those workstations whose network number is the same as that of mine,otherwise the system gets hanged. What may be the problem? (Actually all the values in registers,vaiables structures gets changed after calling getlocaltargetaddress function I found this problem when I was debbuging the program)."
2,Okay,I bought the e book which was nice because I got it the same day but no nice since I can not print it or copy it for notes. This book is very good for new assistants. I would have liked to have read more ideas than hear all the stories. It was an okay book I probably would not recommend it. I was pulled in by the strong title.
5,Wonderful product,"I ordered this, plus a bottle of 35% glycolic acid peel solution. I started with the salicylic acid that accompanied my order, leaving it on for 4 minutes before then putting on the lactic acid solution. The lactic acid is gentle enough not to irritate or feel too tingly, but strong enough to really exfolliate and leave the skin feeling tighter and extremely smooth. I used the lactic acid once a week for 3 weeks, then did the glycolic for 3 weeks. Both are extremely effective. Crows feet are diminishing, acne has disappeared, skin is smooth and glowing. I love this stuff. You won't see the skin peel, as these solutions aren't like a tca peel, but used regularly, they do reveal new, pink, glowing skin, they do remove impurities, they do tighten the skin and help produce new collagen. I'm a big fan of Skin Laboratory - excellent service,and excellent quality."
3,Slips a bit in relation to earlier volumes.,"Ken Akamatsu, Love Hina vol. 4 (Tokyopop, 1999)Oh, Akamatsu-sensei, why'd you have to do it? Here I am all happy that I've found my favorite manga since I discovered Bleach, and you had to go and toss in a super-animal. Worse yet, you had to do so in a volume where the plot seems strained as it is; this is a lot more contrived than earlier volumes (and given how contrived some of the situations get, that's really saying something). I'm not going to stop reading the series, because I still love the characters, but man, I hope this flying turtle fades into the background mighty quick. ***"
5,A Romance with no Drama,This series is grate. Naru realizes(kinda)that she likes Keitaro and before that makes him cry. READ THIS!!!!
5,my favorite cleaning product,I bought a 16 oz about a year ago and I have making my own all purpose spray -- It is a tablespoon 16 oz plus some tea tree oil for a disinfectant -- this cleans everything ! and it gets whatever stains out - I clean the kitchen counters the bath room the floors -- I bought the 32 oz it has lasted about a year -- I am 3/4 thru the bottle -- I clean my fridge doors -- This is an excellent cleaning product -- this is made in the usa always a plus -- I would recommend to a friend - this is good for the environment --
5,the best hazlewood ever,"this is my favorite record of the genius hazlewood,the melodies and the superb string arrangements...when i listen the cd i am in heaven,my favorite song is ""easy & me"". the only regret is the sound quality (no master tape,but the vinyl)...anyway this is a masterpiece you have to buy it...."
1,This is OLD Beyonce from DC!!!,"THIS WAS ONE THE MOST DISAPPOINTING PURCHASES I HAVE EVERY MADE. I RESEARCHED THIS DVD BEFORE I BOUGHT IT AND IT DID STATE IT WAS 90 MINUTES ON MOST SITES THAT I CHECKED OUT.......WELL IT'S NOT ........IT'S ONLY LIKE 30 MINUTES AND ITS ALL OLD DESTINY CHILD VIDEOS....WITH A COUPLE OF K ROWLAND'S VIDEOS. THE ONLY BEYONCE VIDEO IS ""BONNIE AND CLYDE"" WHICH IS NOT JUST HER ANYHOW??? THIS DVD SUCKS!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID. I ACTUALLY JUST THREW IT AWAY."
2,I can't stand it any more,"My wife is usually good at following recipes, of Chinese, French, Italian cuisine etc. None of the dishes she made from this cookbook taste like Indian food. There is something bland about each dish, and most of them taste like cloves. I have quietly suffered through this, chalking it up to the difference between home cooked vs restaurant food.But I realize I have had many home cooked Indian food. My friend's Mom's South Indian dishes were great. My ex-housemate's cooking were excellent whenever we invited people over. His friends usually brought great dishes of their own. One time, a friend of mine whipped up a simple Aloo Mutter in 30 minutes, and I could eat that with rice all day long.But the dishes from this book, I can only rate them as ""blah."" I can't believe the day would come when I start dreading Indian food, but that's what happened to me with his dishes."
1,not much help,"I remained patient on this book, trying many of the recipes only to no avail. I did not find this book helpful at all. Most of the recipes are lacking in flavor and taste while they are also hard to make and very time consuming. I do not think this is a wise purchase since being of Indian descent, even I can prepare better tasting food than what is in this book."
4,Not enough pictures,I like Indian foods but I don't know all the names so I was dissapointed when I didn't see much pictures to match with the recipes.
2,Your butt will not love you,"I'm getting older and fatter and was trying to lighten my ride a bit when I got this seat. Two or three hour rides are fine. Multi-day, five hour rides with younger, faster and stronger riders? Not so good. Not only will you get dropped, your but your ass will hurt as well."
3,NOT FOR PRYING,"Seems to work well enough as a screw driver, but I've had similar problems with the jeweler's screwdriver (smallest) unscrewing itself from the handle when you try to use it. Do NOT use this for prying things open. I thought ""well each bit is metal, and it's metal where it attaches to the handle...surely they would have made it all the way through..."" Nope. Both sides are joined by plastic. Seams like a really dumb idea on a multi-purpose tool."
4,Better than the knock-offs,"I have discovered that these last longer than the Chinese Knock-offs if you don't pay too much. Amazon has the best deal on these, especially if you get the Super-Saver Shipping."
1,complete waste of time; pure dreck and waste of great actors,"really bad story and even worse realization. take fabulous actors and waste them on this terrible script. ouch.Daniel Craig married Rachel Weisz after working on the movie, though."
2,What was this all about?,"Okay, this guy is not who he thinks he is but everyone else in town seems to know his true identity. What his famiily does not know is what he did to them years earlier. Um...yeah. This could have been better but it is just dull."
3,Too predictable,There wasn't much to this plot. Very predictable within the first hour. It could of been better. I enjoy Daniel's Craig performance but there just wasn't much to any of the characters.
4,Dream House,"This Movie Dream House was cool, but it was confusing, someone else mentioned to me that it was confusing too, I have to agree with that, it was sort of hard to follow and put together as to what was happening, I'm definetly gnna watch it again, to see if that helps me understand it better, if it's possible and in your budget, try to rent it first, before buying to make sure you actually like it."
1,A Mess,"The movie is well shot, but plot wise is a terrible mess. It doesn't know what it wants to be and has a poorly realized twist. In fact, if you have seen the trailer, you already know the main plot twist."
3,A suspense movie that's a little different - good story,"A suspense/thriller movie with a different twist than the others. Did it deliver? Yep! You are completely drawn into this movie.It is not so much scary as it is suspenseful, it is not about anything ""supernatural"" like monsters or demons or such, and it is not likely to give you night terrors.I hate to say anything about the story - I think the less you know before watching, the better the movie is going to be for you.It IS a pretty good story though, good acting as well. A little different with it's twists. There is a good ending. It's worth a watch. I give it a 3.5/5 stars(And Rachael Weisz never looked so beautiful in a movie as she does here.)"
2,Meh...,"This movie honestly bored me to tears. There wasn't anything thrilling about it. There wasn't anything exciting about it. It was just boring... The trailer was very misleading. If you want to do a lot of thinking, then sure, watch it. If not, then just turn away. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,Kids love it,"First time I received it the radio switch did not work. The company sent me a replacement but the whole process took weeks. They were polite and helpful. The second one works but there is no way to see what radio station you are on. Not sure if it is broken or made this way but I did not want tO go through returns again so I kept it. It is a fun design that the kids really love. They did however break the light off the side and the front bumper within a week but to be fair they are really rough with things... but it isn't super durable. Overall I like it , it sounds good at reasonable volume level. Distorted at high volume. plays CDs without issue."
3,Collectors Guide to 60's Brit Pop Instrumentals,Not as good as I would have hoped but adequate for the price. Be good to see what Vol 2 offers
1,This Book Is A Waste Of Time!,"The book ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court""starts out with a man named Hank Morgan getting hit over the head witha crow bar during an argument. He awakes to find himself in 600ADCamelot where he gets taken captive by a knight and is to be burned at the stake. Hank tells everyone he's a magacian and uses a solar eclipse to his advantage to be freed from death. He becomes good friends with the king and goes on many adventures with him. Hank tries to modernize civilization but in the end fails miserably. I absolutely hated this book. It would go for pages on end where you wouldn't understand a single word they said. Many times they would attempt to throw in humor but... This book was VERY unrealistic with warping through time and having a solar eclipse fall right on the day of his execution. In conclusion, this book was a waste of my time and and will probably a waste of yours too."
2,A bit disappointing,"I am a fan of most of Mark Twain's works; his wit and charm are unsurpassed, and are ultimately what makes his books worth reading. However, although the book contained elements of these traits, I felt it read more like a technical manual for modernizing a backward people. This made it a tedious read."
4,YANKEE,"The book is a great kids book. It is one of the best books I've ever read. It is about Medieval Times and King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. I can't tell you about, the whole story you can read it for yourself."
4,Great fan!,Arrived early and holds true to product details. Makes almost no noise at all and is the perfect size for a desk fan! Very happy I decided on this product.
4,"Compelling, adventerous, and psychological","This book is about two boys, Harlan and Manny. Harlan is having terrifying premonitions that leave him questioning them. Manny is having nightmares that he thinks are concerning his past. Little do the boys know that their problems have to do with their past and present lives. It turns out they know less about their past than they thought.I thought this book was an excellent book! It was compelling, adventerous, and psychological - all in one book. I was not able to put it down. I also hope that their is an equally thrilling sequel. Everybody thought I was crazy walking around while trying to read that book because it was such a page turner.Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviews[...]Preteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations"
3,hmmm...,"Honestly, the vast majority of this book was quite disappointing. The characterizations and writing weren't quite as forced/unsubtle as in Hartinger's other books, which was a plus, but on the bad side--everything was just really, really DULL. Almost everything in the book seems like filler or fluff; it doesn't really stick with you. If it weren't for the neat twist at the end (which, unlike in The Last Chance Texaco, I didn't actually predict), my Amazon rating would be a lot lower.That said, I did prefer this book to Hartinger's other works. The writing itself wasn't as cringe-worthy."
5,Great organizer that looks great!,This cart is very attractive for a storage cart. Very easy to put together. i was very sick when i received it with a sinus infection and was still able to put it together with no thought in no time. I am diabetic and use it to store my diabetic supplies for my diabetic pump. Works great. Tons of room. Would highly recommend if you want to store something and the storage piece to look great. The smoke colored drawers are great too because they are classy you can still see through them but not enough to identify whats really in it.
2,depression recipes,"I was disappointed in the book, both the content and the actual physical book. It was made of a substance that reminded me of cardboard (maybe it is) and there were no illustrations or pictures. The recipes were ho-hum, as were the reminiscences. To be honest, the book itself was depressing!"
4,jigsaw puzzle,"The description on Amazon fails to indicate all four puzzles are in one box, each in its own plastic bag. This is a problem because the only photo of the individual puzzles are on the very large box. I have taken the box to a photocopy shop to have duplicate photos made for each puzzle and now store them in individual plastic containers. However, the art work on these is absolutely fantastic."
3,Review of cookbook: 500 Fat-Free Recipies,"The second edition which follows this one is MUCH better. I bought them in reverse order and loved the 500 More Fat-Free Recipies. This one is just getting up the momentum. However, both are good books to have on the shelf for no fat cooking ideas."
3,"Good, but could easily be a lot better.","Pros:- Holds lots of treats, or treats and a tennis ball.- Flexible top seal closes well and is easy to use.- The Biscuit Buddy is attractive.Cons:- Belt clip is flimsy and weak. You WILL lose your Biscuit Buddy if you rely on it.- Belt clip is riveted on, hard to replace with something stronger.- Belt loop clip is flimsy plastic and way too small. It took a lot of effort to get it on my Levi's belt loop, and even more effort to get it off.- Belt loop clip has to be destroyed to remove it for replacement with a bigger metal clip.For the above reasons, I would not buy this again if this one were stolen. But it's good enough for the reasons on top for me not to trash it...yet."
2,Dont Buy Falls apart VERY easily!!!!,"I bought one cause it looked like the best one to suit our needs, and now it has become a joke to us to see what falls apart or breaks on it each time we use use it!"
2,Judge Judy Justice Served,Not exactly want I wanted. I thought the movie would be blunders that Judge Judy made while televising her program.
3,Judge Judy,Judge Judy fans will enjoy this DVD. Learned about her family and her career before National TV show.
4,Gotta love Judge Judy,"I really enjoyed this DVD. Like some other reviewers, I didn't think that these were all her most outrageous cases, but I did see some of my favorites and felt that it was a good representation of her show. Can't go wrong with Judge Judy!"
3,Love Judge Judy but What are These Cases?,"I love Judge Judy, but like a lot of the reviewers on here, I really don't know how they chose some of these cases for the DVD. For one thing, almost all of the people included are white. And those of us who are Judge Judy fans know how funny it is when Judge Judy tears apart an irate African American woman who doesn't dress appropriately for court (and so on...) Is that racist? Maybe, but it seems like Af Ams often get very emotional on the show, which leads to funny Judge Judy barbs. That being said, I'm still gonna get this for my Grandpa because he loves JJ, and it's an easy holiday gift. But unless you're getting it as an easy gift, you're better off just watching the show on TV."
2,A slight disappointment,This DVD is well produced but it seems to be lacking something! I love Judge Judy and I don't think this DVD did her justice. It was semi-interesting.
1,Not very sturdy,"It worked well for several months. Then, one day, the lock cylinder pulledout still attached to the key. Its easy enough to stick back in, but youknow, it shouldn't really come out! Anyhoo, not the sucker needs to bereplaced - I don't know how secure it really is anymore."
5,good lock,"This lock is good for apartment use. It allows the spare key to go to the manager so he/she can get in when needed while you're away, without having to sacrifice security by leaving it off when you know someone has legitimate plans to enter your dwelling."
3,no flex band,"I thought the "" Plus Flex-band"" meant the flex-band was included with the DVD. IT IS NOT. The instructor did a decent job but also suggested buying handles for the flex-band.....another additional purchase. I was disappointed and felt disceived."
3,I like it except,"Bought this and then returned nice design, easy to read water proof fun looking , band is too damn short, again band is too damn short, come on who has a wrist that tiny, or maybe this is a children watch. Anyway this is America are kids are too fat so it still wouldnt work."
5,LOVE,I Love this poster. Everyone that comes over thinks its hilarious. I have it in my living room. Their dumb expressions are great! Haha. It reminds me not to take myself so seriously.
1,Toshiba Laptop,"After a week of back and forth emails with their tech support, I still can't capture more than 30 seconds of video before the card stops working."
3,Decent tweeter,"I'm running a pair of these off of my head unit. They provide highs that my 6x9's can't reach. They aren't the best tweeters out, but they are pretty decent. For the price, I'm satisfied. They also have multiple install options, which is nice."
4,Nice little tweeter. Does what I need it to do.,"I first bought these tweeters before I bought my amp and sub and it was just to much. The highs were overpowering everything. Then I bought some Memphis 6x9s and my mids came to life. But I still needed some low end bass. So I got a Cadence 800watt amp and a Rockford Fosgate P3 10 in a ported box and now I have the best sounding system I've ever had. The tweeters are perfect if you have a 10 or 12. However, if you have some major bass, like a 15 or two 12s then I would go with some Kenwood tweeters (In my opinion Kenwood has the loudest tweeters). These are'nt the loudest but sound great are very loud, just not the loudest. By the way I paid 35 for mine at a local audio shop, so the price that amazon has them for, its a no-brainer, pick these."
1,It went 'POOF' and we only turned it on!! We are from Australia - so obviously we got an adaptor ...... DOES NOT EVEN GO!!!!!,Now What ........... How do I get my $$$ Back - or at least one that WORKS!!!! Amazon HELP me PLEASE!!
1,Ceased working after 3 months,"I bought this a few months ago and it was very helpful in getting us through the hot summer (nighttime use only), but a few days ago it started cutting out whenever I tried to set it to oscillate. Yesterday it stopped working altogether. It will no longer turn on. It is completely dead, and there is no help for it. My $50 investment will be on the trash heap tomorrow. I would not buy this or any fan from Lasko again. I've heard of ""built-in obsolescence,"" but completely failing after only a few months is ridiculous and unacceptable!!!"
3,Deathrace 2000 meets the Running Man,"""Deathrace"" is not a remake ofDeath Race 2000 - Special Editionthere are no visible audience cult members sacrificing themselves for the glory of their divers like in the old 1970's cult film. It is more a remake of the ""Govenator's"" filmThe Running Man (Special Edition)but instead of a TV game show, it is a Pay Per View internet sporting event, where once again the convicts compete for their freedom, creating all kinds of carnage along the way.So here's the deal, you need an actor for a car chase movie? (Jason Statham) check; Need lots of carnage? Check; Need lots blood and gore? Check; Want an original or moving story? Sorry!2 *"
2,Grade a C - bouncy camera action and obvious plot,"I liked the idea of the film because of the 'car wars' reference. The movie apparently is a remake of a book or movie called 'car wars 2000' though i was interested in the concept because of a game called 'car wars' by a dice game company.The movie has a very simplistic character development and you don't feel the characters so you don't really get into the film. A lot of the film is quickly moved on. Again no development.The Plot is written to move quick and like the characters pretty blah. so you can predict its every move.As for the action, it is alright though if you want to actually see the action it is a bit like 'daredevil' in that the camera bounces around so fast you can't really see what is going on or get an idea. I personally don't like that as much.The way it is shot, the taste of the grit look is nice and gives a nice appeal.i give it a C- really. not a memorable one, nor really just fun, but just is. A let down for me."
4,Check It Out,"I'm a fan of the original ""Death Race"" (which almost no one has ever even HEARD of!) so I went into this with a little trepidation. However, I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it. Quite violent and gory with solid special effects (as the story requires), with a fairly strong cast and an acceptable updating of the ""car race"" concept against current trends, the film doesn't try to do much besides provide a solid 2 hours of entertainment. And, in my mind, it certainly succeeds (better than the overhyped ""Wanted"", for example). There is no cross-country race, which I would have loved to see in it somehow, but regardless, it is an enjoyable romp."
3,"You will rent this, because you know exactly what you will be getting :)","Cars, chicks, explosions, inmates, death-defying situations and a warden who knows what it takes to make a fortune.That line pretty much sums up the movie -- which isn't to say that it is bad, just exactly what you'd expect the movie to be based on the cover image and name :)"
5,The Staying power of Statham,"Jason Statham. Wow. Even a bad movie he makes a small 30 second cameo in is better for his overwhelming badassness...and this movie isnt too bad. He's what Vin Diesel should've been. I don't think you can really quantify the qualities he adds to a movie, just a sneering, Charles-Bronson-Clint-Eastwood granite-like presence that adds a lot of credibility to an action flick.And this flick could probably use some credibility. Dont try to approach Death Race too cereberally, it is named Death Race after all. You can drive the behemoth truck ""Dreadnaught"" through the plot holes and circumventing of reality this movie frequently puts out there.But damn its fun. Ian McShane says it best, ""That's entertainment"". It is, and a 90 minute movie with no lull in the action is something that is sadly missing from Hollywood these days. As popcorn flicks go, this is one of my favorite in a long, long time."
1,aaa?,"45 piece first aid kit, so is there 40 bandaids and that counts as a piece, you gotta be kidding me. I may just cancel my AAA membership after this pos."
1,Waste of money,I bought this a long time ago and finally used it tonight. What a waste of money. It contains enough batter for about 8 small to medium pancakes so it needs to be refilled frequently. The cover is nearly impossible to put on properly and if you have any dough on your hands forget about trying to take the cover off for a refill. It was an expensive one-time use gadget. Too bad I waited so long to try it out or I'd send it back...now it's in the trash!
4,Excellent Addition To Your Cooking Gadget Arcenal,It is a fairly neat and convenient way to dispense uniformed pancakes onto a griddle. It does have a slight tendency to leak a drop or two but is easily rectified with a paper towel or plate. It is very efficient in its dispensing of the batter and is completely disassembled for quick and easy washing. I highly recommend this item.
2,Ehhhh,"When I first saw this I was like ""SWEET THATS GONNA ROCK"".....Well I was wrong. it was....well pretty stupid. See I thought it was gonna really make smoke (call me stupid lol)BUT really it just makes this flaky stuff fly all over the place and it smells like nasty old matches. its really sticky and its not good for a magic trick. dont waist your money on this."
1,Didn't Work,I bought the item after watching a YouTube video of a girl just rubbing her fingers together and smoke appearing. In order for this product to work you have to snap your fingers like you are packing a lip. The smoke is a stringy substance not actual smoke. It smells horrible and once its on your fingers it is very hard to get off.
1,Smells and Works Terribly!,"The first time you open the product, you can already smell that awful ""burning tire"" smell. Then when you put it in your fingers, it feels thick and very sticky. The instructions tell you what to do. I followed them, and I did not detect any smoke. None. And when you try to wash it off, it doesn't come off your skin. So not only is it sticky, smelly, and gross, it doesn't even work. This is just a sticky piece of crap, and I do not recommend buying it."
3,That's It?,"This is the only vintage VHS of Trixter out there I guess, so I bought it. Unfortunately, all it contains are the music videos for the songs One in a Million & Give It to Me Good. The entire thing is only about 10 minutes. It's a shame that they couldn't include some interviews or behind the scenes footage like most of these old school VHS' have. I am still glad I bought it though because I love this band and the videos are pretty cool. I actually saw them live 3 times back in the day.... good stuff!"
4,Wonderful!,Very relaxing and enchanting music! It will grow on you each time you listen. I suggest listening from beginning to end without pause to capture the richness of this recording. Enjoy!
2,Drains too much,"2 1/2Lushly bleak atmospherics can delve too deeply into mood over substance for an album of this length, providing insightful alternatives in goth-pop evolution but ultimately sounding overextended and sonically redundant."
3,Not amazing,"It's so unfortunate. I got Filigree & Shadow from This Mortal Coil and I loved it. This album is uninteresting. Nothing on it is particularly memorable. I'm not moved to listen to it for fun, but rather to try to find something that sounds good."
4,NOT SEPULTURA,"I purchased this cd because it stated it was for sepultura fans. I was very surpise, this cd is really good. Not a wimp song on the disc. If you are soft and weak this is not for you."
3,newly received order,Shipping was timely but specimen is poor. Several key branches were topped out already. Will never be prime specimen.
1,Disappointed,"The maple tree came beautiful packed and arrived quickly. I was quit impressed with the packing. The tree does not in any way look like the picture. Even though it's not what I ordered and what I really expected, I named the tree ""The Ugly Duckling."" She is beautiful in my eyes, but in no way is the picture identical to what I received. I have purchased others from Brussels and was satisfied. Not this time."
4,Worth the price,"I bought this item because I never had bed-in-bag before and wanted to try this out before spending big money on high-priced items..Evenif it is 60/40 poly cotton, I am satisfied with the product. The color seems to be extactly what is shown in the picture. (some people here got different colors..so be aware). The feel of the cloth is ok.In short, This is the best price I got for 180 TC 60/40 poly cotton bed-in bag (I paid 19.99)..Please do not expect quality of 100% cotton(200-300TC).. This one falls below that...So if you are looking for avg bed in bag(OK price-OK quality), this is the one to consider...Update 12/28: I am using this from last week and I must say this is excellent..You cannot compare this with Wal-Mart.This is much better than walmart one....I bought comfortor from walmart for around $25, so only comfortor in the set is worth the price.."
5,No problems whatsoever,"Despite some of the complaints about this product, I went ahead and ordered the queen set since the price was right ($30). Though it was a little stiff when I first opened it, one washing has softened the fabric considerably. I'm very very happy with this bed set, especially considering the price. Looks great and love the reversible comforter. Now, if I had paid over $200 for the set I may not say the same thing, but you have to compare apple to apples. It's not Egyptian or Pima cotton or any high thread count. But it's a great product in it's category."
2,"scratchy, thin and cheap",Barely worth the cheap price I paid. Don't count on it lasting long. Also the red is more burgundy or maroon than it looks in the picture. And the check pattern in the sheets and pillow cases is much more tan than in the picture as well.
5,Make an appointment with The Appointment today!,"I don't care what the critics say, Don Cummings only chews half the scenery. And can you blame him? It's tasty scenery.Why a man can be in every frame in a film and not on the cover is beyond me."
1,Snore Bore,Save your money. It's another stereotypical novel that over exaggerates in an attempt to achieve success. Lacking in creativity and character depth.
4,Nice music,Thank you for sending this CD in good condition and on time. I would recommend other Michael Card CD's. My husband loves his music.
3,Fun for about three days,"Well, I LOVE these types of games. And while this game has great graphics and a really cool concept... I found it just wasn't fun to play after a few days. It's insanely difficult to progress, and it so time consuming.If you like the Sims, it's worth a shot. Just realize that it doesn't have the ""staying power"" that the Sims does."
3,Sims-No way,I'm a long time Sim player and when a new game was out like the Sims I jump at it.Graphics are good but it's harder to play then the sims.The tutorial doesn't help all that much.Stick with the Sims.
2,Sigh... yawn... sigh,"Sims gone WAY too slow, without the control of the sims. I do love simulation games, but this has got to be the slowest sim game to start. You will spend a lot of time building rooms, mostly while paused. I would spend 4 hours on layout, realise I've spent so much time on it and never get around to playing much after opening the hotel.Now, if you like building hotel rooms, boy is this the game for you. Having not played the 20 or so hours it takes to finish even one scenerio, I can't comment on how easy or hard it is to complete a level... really, I'd just lose interest after hour 12 of gameplay.This is definately a game for someone that has absolutely NO life outside of sim gaming.Graphically, I liked it. You get so many options for walls, floors, lighting, layout, ammenities and pricing it's a wonder that I disliked it so much. :("
1,It's Bad,This game stinks. I thought with all the good reviews that it would be good but it wasn't. When I first started playing it I thoght it was really cool but it got boring really quick. It is to hard to get people in your facilitys and even if you get people in them they don't make money. Once you do start to make money you try to expand your hotel and you go bankrupt. I WOULD NOT reccomend any one to buy this product because it is a waste of money.
1,Somebody actually liked this,I bought this based on a review on the page for this CD. I love Bill Laswell and Sonny Sharrock but OMG this really sucks.
2,TFal deep fryer,The size is nice for 2 people. Cleaning is easy. Seems to be a defect in that the unit has to sit just right on the base or it will not go on and off by itself. You have to juggle it to be sure it is seated just right to get it to come back on after the oil is heated up and then you have to be real careful that it stays seated just right.
3,Toning for teens,"The workout was great..I did notice a difference. However, her nutrition section is wrong. There are better books out there than this one for weight/strength training."
1,disappointing,"Even for a hard core student of the Waffen SS,I viewed this book as a complete waste of money. Hans Bayer is prolly a man with a limited education, having to leave school like so many young German men did in that period and the book is not a good read both because of that and a rather rough translation of the book from German to English.While Bayers story is interesting and the memoirs of a average SS Grenadier are very rare,this book would have been better had Bayer used a co author. If I can recommend 3 good books on the Waffen SS offered here by Amazon let me recommend these: 1: ""Chronicle of the 7 panzerkompanie"" by Ralf Tiemann 2: ""Comerades to the End: History of the Der fuhrer Panzergrenadier regt""by Otto Weidinger 3:""The WaffenSS at War"" By George H Stein Tiemann and Weidinger are former Waffen SS officers and give good accounts of their respective units. Stein is a academic who give a overview and history of the entire Waffen SS"
2,Yet another re-recording,"This turned out to be yet another original artist re-recording. I wish they would leave well enough alone. It is the original hits we want, not some updated version. The songs are OK as they are but not the originals. Most disappointing."
1,Horrible Casebook,"I too have used this book for two semesters of Con Law. In my opinion it is the absolute worst casebook I have ever had to use.The comments after the cases do nothing to clarify anything and frankly as a 1L you will be too busy reading for all your other classes you won't have time to read the 50 pages of comments after every case anyway.If you have to use this casebook, you'd better hope that you get a good professor or at least get Gilberts/Emanuel!"
3,Exhaustive Detail... Invaluable Information,"Yes, the text is pretty dense and makes for a slow read, but the the detailed index and sheer volume of cases makes this a valuable resource. No, it's not ideal for a soak in the tub or as a coffee table volume, but useful nonetheless."
4,Old and new Hawaiian,"This album contains an interesting mix of old and new hawaiian music, most of it pretty nice. It also includes a funny dialog between a hotel guest trying to order a room service meal and the harried order taker who's not paying attention, and ends with her exclaiming, 'tourists!'The title is a little misleading. I honestly thought I was buying something with selections from 50 different albums, but as there are only 17 songs on the album, this is not the case. Obviously there are 2 more volumes of ""50 Greatest Hawai'i Albums of all time.' Still, I'm happy that I bought this album."
5,Amazing,"This donut is the best! Bought it for work due to the cheap chairs they had me sit in for 8hrs were causing my tailbone to hurt! As soon as I sat in it the feeling is amazing! The material is strong and durable, it held my fat self just fine. A real life saver! Without a doubt recommended it and will continue to! Thanks, Carex!"
2,Didn't work for me,"I was having hip pain that radiated down my leg and thought this might help, but it didn't. I don't know if it was too hard or what, but it just wasn't comfortable."
4,great for softness and being tough,Use it all day long in my desk office chair .. saves me a few bruises. It should last well as the seams seem well attached
5,Ultimate relief with little cost,"I have alot of trouble sitting on a hard chair for very long. I have tried many different and expensive cushions to get relief from my sciatic pain in such situations. I ordered this specifically for a seminar I attend every year for 4 straight days, about 6 hours a day. I have used it for 2 days at this seminar and FINALLY I am not in pain the whole day! What a relief! Other cushions just squish down to nothing and I still get the pressure on my behind. This is totally different, there is some give and not the pressure to endure. It seems to be a very sturdy little ring--I don't inflate it all the way, just about half and it has saved my life. So don't waste your money on expensive ""memory foam"" products--this works great! I highly recommend!"
5,Very good,This ring is an essential item for long sitting jobs. We recently used this on a long road trip and it worked very well.
3,Third of the Foundation series.,"This novel, as with the other two original Foundation novels, were written in the 1950's and are thus considered relatively safe novels.They are from the Golden Age of sci-fi and do seem a bit dated in todays world."
3,Not USB2!,"Make sure you note that this is a USB and not a USB2 card. If that's what you're looking for, you're in good shape."
5,Another Superb Keiko Matsui production,Keiko Matsui continues to produce some unique music that is always first class. Its the kind of music that you could listen to over and over again.
1,almost sent it back,"Connecticut Electric Zinsco replacement 2 pole 100 amp full size breakercame in barely working order - had to ""play"" with both for at least 5 minutes and was thinking to send it back, due to the mulfunction, but than finaly got it to work (do not know how long it will last - used only one and the other was kept for spare) - paid express shipping as well to get it a.s.a.p. price was right, about 40% less than anywhere else, but - ""you get what you paid for"" - if i had to do it again - probably would not."
1,I'm disappointed with stock status,"I'm really disappointed. I expected the circuit breaker on April 16th and here it is April 21st. First they said it was lost in transit, then they said it wasn't in stock. I always check to see if it is in stock first; I don't like to deal with back-orders. They were in stock. If it sold out, it would've been nice to be notified. I've never had this problem with the many things I've ordered from Amazon. This is a first, but still I am very disappointed."
2,Ultra 2 Eyelash Refills Don't Fit Properly,"I have a STANDARD eyelash curler. You know, the stainless steel one that has been around longer than anyone can remember. The Ultra 2 refills fall right out of it. End of story."
1,An expensive coaster,"I have just purchased the Windows Server 2003 Bible and like the other Bible, it is has a lot of pages, open to interpretation, full of errors and out of date information. For example, Quantum hard drives are a recommended quality drive to purchase. I have no disagreement with the word quality, but Quantum haven't been around for a while and it seems like hardware information wasn't update from the draft copy. This then set the tone of the book. I also found it difficult to read as it seems very disjointed and poorly proof-read with the operating system being called Windows 2003 Server and .Net Server in the same paragraph. This book seems to be based more on Windows XP than the server version. Overall an extremely poor performance.I have a colleague I don't like so now I have the perfect gift."
4,pleasant companion,"Easy going music at incredible price. Some familiar classic tunes calmly ""refreshed"" with soothing rhytmic beat not happily ""assaulted"" like Hooked on Classics, nice buy."
4,A resource for your forest gardening plans,"How to Make a Forest Garden is a slender volume at only 160 pages, but it covers the basics fairly well. Addressing many areas concerning this form of permaculture, I nonetheless felt that more illustrations and designs would have helped explain the many detailed and specific concepts covered here more fully. Whitefield's offering is good, I just wanted MORE!"
3,Very erotic but.....,"This is only the second erotic novel that I have read. I was an avid romance reader a few years back. I've just started reading romance again and order this book for a spicery read. The sex scenes were vivid and detailed without being lewed. I am not interested in threesomes or same sex or public sex which this book didn't have. The chemistry between Kate and Tair was hot but the overall story was just so so. Maybe I needed to read the first book in the series because the book needed more that just good sex in my opinion. This scene was set on another world but the reader was never given a good look at this other world. Kate never met other people or explored her new ""home"" . There were not details about the planet or Tairs work or culture other than details about merging and linking.I think that I will stick to traditional romance because I like a good story as well as good sex."
5,The work of the Holy Spirit,"A wonderful insight into the work of the Holy Spirit, His gifts, and His Person. Fr. McCarthy has assembled the key writings of John Paul II on the Spirit and organized them with commentary. An excellent guide through the Holy Father's writings on this subject. I am amazed to see it selling used for so much some places; I got my copy from the author for less than $10.00. Highly recommended."
3,"NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT, BUT BETTER THAN NOTHING...","The quality of this DVD-R is probably on the same level as Alpha's and other low-end public domain companies. Not great, and even borderline unacceptable at times. But, unless Warner Archives decides to release the original RKO vault prints of Breen's films, or Breen's own entertainment business in Florida produces better film elements, I'm afraid this DVD will have to do -- if you are a Bobby Breen fan, that is.Com'on, Warner Archive -- cough 'em up!"
3,Average Fryer,For the money this fryer is ok. Have had 5 deep fryers over the years. Three over the last 2 years. Would rather pay more and get what best suits me.Pros: Easy to filter drain the oil into supplied plastic container. Wash all parts in the dishwasher.Cons: Basket rusts through dishwasher cleaning after 8 to 10 uses. The unit cooks small amounts of food.
1,Wouldn't buy it again,"Wanted this because of the way it lets you drain the oil so that the next time you use the fryer the oil is clean. That's the only good thing about it. I've had mine a few months now. The first time I used it and washed it , the writing came off the front so you can't tell where to turn the knob for the right temperature. The oil leaks out the bottom (even though I make sure it securely seated on the heating unit) and goes across the counter, can't pick it up to clean the oil up until it cools down. The handle on the basket won't stay locked and when you go to pick it up out of the fryer with the hot food in it, it comes unlocked. After burning my hand because of this, I decided to write this review. If I can find one I'll go back to using the Grandpappy."
4,Pretty Good,"I just got it and it seems to shoot well. I would onl recommend this as a side arm. If your looking for a main weapon you may want to invest in a better electric or a gas pistol. But once again, its fine for a side arm."
3,techno manifestations of France's colonial past,"This is a disk of house or techno music from 1995 based on ""African and Arab music that has worked its way into French culture."" Two and three remixes of tracks by Algerians Khaled and Rachid Taha, respectively, and two from West African Mory Kante. The remixes tend to simply preserve the vocals from the originals and replace the instrumental tracks with typical techno programming. Less organic fusions than, say, the typical cut on a Six Degress collection."
2,Tooooooooo expensive for what you get,"In the picture you can clearly see two sets of blades, don't make the same mistake I did, it is only one set, nothing out of this world."
3,"Good features, but a bit buggy","Has a number of good features like a recording/copying guide that makes recording, copying, erasing, etc. pretty simple. However, the unit seems to have a couple of bugs. For one, sometimes when I put in a VHS or DVD, I can't control it (stop, rewind, ff, etc.) until I switch control focus and then go back (if I put in a VHS, I have to switch control from VHS to DVD and then back). Another issue I found is when copying from VHS to DVD, syncing isn't exact, so the DVD misses the first few seconds of the VHS. Which means you have to set the VHS start point to a few seconds before where your content actually starts. So the bugs do have workarounds, but they're still a bit frustrating. Fortunately, I didn't pay full price - I got a refurbished one."
5,Excellent Book,"The book helped improve my score 170 points, and now I have over 1400. Thanks a a lot ""Up Your Score"""
1,why not less than one star?,"The first one of these I bought not only smelled, the vinyl was sticky and after washing several times it became apparent that this condition was not going to go away. Manufacturer replace with another cable that only smelled. This cable worked well for a couple of months and then 2 small parts on the 4pin end started falling off. Cable stilled worked as long as I could keep track of these parts and keep putting them back on. Eventually the cable smell diminished, but so did the functionality..."
1,Absolutely terrible.,"Why have rear speakers when nothing ever comes out of them? Regardless of what I'm listening to, be it a DVD movie, music, or an on-line video, sound only comes out the front speakers. And yes, I have ""5.1 surround sound speakers"" selected in the control panel.I think the only sound that actually comes out of all five speakers is the Windows shutdown sound. Whoopee. I can hardly contain my excitement."
1,didnt work,"my feet are pretty bad, and though i wasnt expecting it to work miracles, i did expect at least some small, small difference the first time that i used it. there was absolutely no difference. would not recommend this product.thank you"
1,"It arrived in bad condtion, damaged","This is one of the movies that arrived 100% damaged, totally balck screen, I could not see any of the movies. I did return it and then, Amazon com refunded me. I would love to get this movie, but what garantee am I going to have that it is not going to arrive damaged again? It came damaged twice when I ordered the collection ""Hammer Horror Collection"" and when I ordered separated. Please review and if you are interested in sending that one to me, I am INTERESTED in buying, however, I want you to open it up, test it out in two computers, two dvD FIRST, so that we all make sure it is REALLY working.Thank you,Jacqueline Grecco"
4,Art Work - What a joke!,"I have not even opened the package for this classic film from Hammer Studios - because I can not get past some obvious errors and bad choices on the packaging of the DVD from Warner. First, this film has always been considered a classic movie with fine production, acting and script components.So why is the outside of the front cover listing the film as Christopher Lee's ""Fang-tastic"", first ever, etc...??? I take umbrage with the use of this explotative term, that I would coin for an Abbott and Costello movie. And why would they use such a ... cover poster. Dracula does not even look like Christopher Lee. Fo course the last error is the obvious glitch on the back cover, which I don't need to mention again here..."
1,Didn't help my shepard,"I was hoping this would help my male German Shepard, but he is still miserable. I used this for 2 months and still he is scratching and biting himself. I'll go back to getting him cortisone shots and hope that helps."
4,How Far Would You Go?,"I wonder how Brian Garfield feels about the monster that he spawned with `Death Wish'. If I'd written a beautifully spare, cerebral examination of an overweight, middle-aged, liberal New Yorker who collapses under the weight of his impotent rage at the murder of his wife, and his daughter's subsequent nervous breakdown, and then seen the character transformed into a poster boy for vigilante justice by Charles Bronson (in a movie franchise of steadily declining quality), I'd probably experience what can diplomatically be described as ""mixed feelings"" at best. It's a pity that most people will come to this novel with preconceptions, because its very well written and really does deserve to be more widely read; after all, the theme of a Nuclear family destroyed by indiscriminate urban violence is as timely as ever - as a glance at the front page of any major newspaper will attest."
4,hard to call,"I could see how some hardcore reggae fans might find this not-to-their-liking, and I too was unsure of this when I saw it. After listening to it as it's own piece of music, I'd give it the go ahead. Its not the type of thing you'd hear coming out of Kingston, but all the music here is created by the Wailers and comes from the original tracks. If we could just get Island to release the strictly dub tracks without as many the modern effects, we'd be in much better shape. BUT, this is an interesting reinterperetation of the vibes Marley was putting out."
4,some missed the point,"This is an interpretation of Bob's music by one of the best ambient electronica producers and session bass players out there. If you didn't know what you were buying then I'm sorry you threw your money away, but if you would have done your research you would have known what you were getting into. This was never supposed to be roots music, is a remix album and it pretty much says so right on the cover. It's really good if your into mellow dubbed out techno."
4,historical and dramatic,Historically interesting but also is dramatic and has some humor throughout that keeps the characters human so you feel you can identify with them.Also gives some insight into that time period. I love Horatio's awkwardness mixed with his high level of skill.
5,Calm Waters Run Deep,"Jane Clement's poems have power, depth, and remarkable sensitivity. They are not mere verse; Clement has something to say that you need to hear. If your life is harried and phrenetic, this book can help you find that quiet haven of peace where you can take a fresh look at the forces ruling your life. But to do this you will have to take time out to ponder these deceptively simple poems. You can't take them in on the run. They don't shout and posture; they whisper, like the whisper of quiet waters. But watch out: their power will come in on you, and no one can stem the tide."
2,Not a Must See,"If you are a heterosexual, I don't think you will enjoy this movie!!! In case you were wondering, it has nothing to do with religion. I don't recommend anyone to watch this but I've seen worse. Not the best and not the worst. It has no full frontal nudity. If you are a homosexual male, really bored with nothing else better to do, you might enjoy this movie but even if that's the case you will not enjoy it very much."
5,One Of The Years Best,"This is an amazing full legnth debut. Featuring exmembers of Today Is The Day, this album defys the laws of . simply amazing."
5,"This album DESTROYS, I love it!","Mastodon's Remission is simply phenomenal. It's got everything from angry shouting vocals, loud crushing guitar riffs, pummeling bass lines, and very intense drumming, I mean it sounds a lot like doom metal to me. The album kicks off with two very intense numbers ""Crusher Destroyer"" and ""March Of The Fire Ants"" which show the band's tight muscianship. The 6 min+ epic ""Ol'e Nessie"" starts out slow and moody, and really heats up when the insane riffs take command. ""Burning Man"" is another great song with some insane drum work at the opening part of the song. So anyway, if you're into some real heavy technical metal, this album is yours. HAIL MASTODON!!"
5,All circles created with intention,"This cd is probably worth the $$ just for the drumming alone but thankfully the rest of the band has enough talent to back it up with. First off, Brann Dailor is an AMAZING drummer and does an incredible job on this cd , without his drumming this cd would of just been very good and not amazing.At some points Mastodon reminds of Tool a little bit(check the beginning of ""ol'e nessie"") and a little of Isis(very dynamic,plenty of different textures,and requires more than one listen to grasp it all). Overall Mastodon create an incredible,intense,melodic,flowing,dynamic cd that is one of the better cd's i've heard in quite awhile(and probably Relapse's best of 2002). this is a MUST BUY!!!"
2,Mastering dumb,"With only a few things to say musically over brutishly bland beatings, the album should entertain metal fans without pulling outside interest in."
5,THE FINEST WORLDJAZZ INTERPLAY,A NEW MUSICAL LANGUAGE A NEW KEY TO MUSICAL EXPRESSION ?YES AND SOMETHING MORE . virtuosity interplay and timing at its best .SUPERB RECORDING AMONG THE BEST WORLDJAZZ RELEASES EVER MADE .The gift of musical communication among dave holland /double bass mino cinelu /percussion and kevin eubanks /acoustic guitar is absolutely AWESOME .
4,"Very helpful, for problems big and small","Although the book tended to get repetitions at times, I found it to be very helpful. It has numerous sections (noise, border disputes, tree problems) that walk the reader through what steps to take in what order, to solve the problem. It has a crash course in small claims court issues. One point that I took away was that the first two steps to take are, 1) document the date & time of all infractions, and 2) talk to the neighbor before taking (or threatening) more drastic steps. Too often people say ""sue them"" or ""call the police"", whereas a solution can very often be found just by having a discussion with the neighbor. Quite honestly, that never would have occurred to me. I'm probably one of those who would have mistakenly tried the police first. I highly recommend this book if you have problems with neighbors. (I don't right now, but I have in the past, and I really wish I had this book at that time.)"
5,My favorite wine tasting glasses,"I love the Riedel Ouverture series glasses and have the red wine, white wine and magnum sets. Only $8 per stem and the same shape as the much more expensive Vinum series. Supposedly, the no lead allows them to be put in the dishwasher, but I always hand wash them. Good light but strong wine glass with a nice length stem; many wine glasses have overly long stems. Don't know why more wine stores don't carry the Ouverture glasses. For me, they are the only ones to own."
3,New but poor,"I'm a big LN fan. Good to hear some new work. However, the sound quality is poor. The production was done so that the vocals are way in the background."
4,"A good, basic faith-builder","I agree with the reader immediately below this review, in that Kennedy has a tendency towards being condescending. However, he is a friendly, easy-to-read writer who is both capable and humorous. This book is not the cream of the intellectual crop (although Kennedy probably is), but it is a fair introduction into apologetics.I recommend it.Peace,Christinaphylus"
2,"Not for ""advanced"" collector","agree with one of your other reviewers--a lot of pages, several facsimilies, and the most useful section being the introductory forward by Stephen Raab and the description of paper, ink, etc. What is surprising is the virtual complete lack of mention and certainly no text regarding the founding fathers, signers of the declaration, signers of the constitution, famous historical figures who were not signers such as Revere, John Paul Jones, Arnold, Jay, Marshall etc. Any ""advanced"" collector immediately comes to grip with these names. Presidents do have a section but it is modest considering the fact that this category is the overwhelmingly most popular collecting topic for most ""advanced"" collectors with American history, historical authors and composers next in line."
5,this is the best,"if your a fan of dragonball z this book u must get! i've red it 20 times and im still not tired of it. this book is where Goku and vegeta have to fuse to defeat Janemba, some guy that took over anither guys body in hell. it also has gotenks in it which is Goten and Trunks fused.this book is the best!"
3,South Riding,"I did not buy this film, but did watch on PBS Masterpiece Theater. It was a bit slow for me and although the actors did a great job, I sadly admit it wasn't among my favorites. I am a huge Masterpiece Theater fan, but was a bit disappointed in the story."
2,South Riding review,"Although I liked the production and the characters, I feel the author made some implausible choices with the plot. First, most patients with ? schizophrenia don't jump off tall buildings while normal when young as Robert's wife did. Exactly what was wrong with Robert's wife was never developed, likely because of a lack of knowledge of psychiatric disease. Also I found it very odd that Robert's daughter chose to go with her grandfather at the end, leaving behind the house she had lived in all her life and all the people she had ever known--unbelievable considering her extreme anxiety and previous clinging behavior! And then the darkest part, the cliff breaks off and dumps Robert and his horse down to the sea! The exact reverse of the male protagonist in Jane Eyre, whose wife dies, freeing him to remarry. Overall a very unrealistic and unfulfilling story."
1,Confused Plot - Uninteresting Characters,South Riding was very disappointing! The plot is an undeveloped hodge-podge of clutter all crammed together. The male characters are stiff and boring and one wonders why the creators would choose those actors at all for male-lead roles. None of the characters make me care about them at all!
2,Great book terrible delivery time,the book was fine but delivery to me took almost 30 days to arrive from the seller!! I will never buy used again like this
5,Excellent,"For my dermatitis, there's nothing better. I recommend this shampoo to anyone who doesn't tolerate perfumes, colorants and other stuffs that irritates your scalp."
5,Most unusual coloring book ever...adults only!,"This has to be the most 'unusual' book I have yet encountered. Shows external female genitals...reduced from a photo to plain white paper with black outlines. Great gift for open-minded ladies for their partners...male or female. An obvious gift for the 'person who has everything,' assuming they still have sexual curiosity and a large box of crayons ;-)"
2,What exactly are these things we're coloring?,"I admire the spirit behind this book. However, many of the genitals in this book don't look like genitals at all, but more like abstract ... things. I would appreciate some accuracy in a book like this, because it is meant to be educational. Corinne should have left the Picasso images to Picasso."
2,VERY HELPFUL,"[The Complete Book of SewingASIN:0789404192 The CVERY HELPFUL BOOK , I NEEDED IT TO LEARN HOW TO LINE A DRESS WITH ABODICE, THAT I COULDN'T FIND ANY INFORMATION ON, I HAD TO TAKE BITSAND PIECES FROM SKIRTS, ONE PIECE DRESS, IMFORMATION WAS TOO LITTLEON LINING. OVERALL THE BOOK WAS A GOOD ONE."
4,"Good, at times","This collection of articles from Bitch magazine is a necessity to women. I enjoyed quoting it on my blogs and reading sections to my friends while we sat on my patio.Unfortunately, I found myself skipping over some articles due to the rather dry approach to writing that some of the authors used."
4,"Death is an ever present fascination, isn't it Mr. Ball?","Alan Ball...again creates a death obsessive world where there is enough kitsch, quirky and kink to keep you interested and unable to stop watching!This series is no where near as thought provoking as Six Feet Under or American Beauty (both I would rate 5) therefore this one gets a 4. It's still got merit as a suspenseful story that goes in directions you don't expect.I've only seen season 1, so I am hungry for more, Mr. Ball... I await your delivery!"
1,Just Trash and nothing but trash,Want to see how white trash live and interact with each other.....The acting is as bad as the dialogue..
2,Did Charlaine Harris approve this series???,"I watched the 1st disc and enjoyed it even though there were glaring differences from the book, went on to the 2nd disc and even proceeded to the 3rd disc. After the last episode on the 3rd disc, I've decided I'm done with the DVD's and will just read the books. They are so much better and they are after all the ""Sookie Stackhouse"" novels and not the ""Jason Stackhouse"" novels! The differences from the book and the DVD just kept increasing to the point that I no longer wanted to watch. Sookie is smart and pretty in the book, in the movie she is the cliche' of a pretty, dumb, southern blonde. In the end my final thoughts were sympathy for Charlaine Harris and what they did to her novels."
3,DISC QUALITY FOR TRUE BLOODS FIRST SEASON,"I received by True Blood season 1 set and watched it this weekend. The series is WONDERFUL but the last two disc's were bad and skipped. Thats two disc's that were annoying and kept skipping, don't know that i would recommend purchasing this from Amazon if this is the quality they provide."
3,VERY GRAPHIC!,"I read all the Sookie Stackhouse books, but these videos are way too hard core for me. The episodes do follow a lot of the story line, but too much time is spent on Sookie's brother's escapades - no other word to describe it but PORN! Personally, between the horrific language (I know - it's HBO, what was I thinking?) and the soft porn exploding every other minute....oh my. Sorry, just too much for me."
2,tricked,"HBO and vampires meets soap opera. Lame, I could only watch a couple episodes cause I just felt like I was being tricked into watching a soap opera about characters I didnt care about who were just doing half the stuff they did for shock value. I'll stick with real entertainment, I.E. Breaking Bad"
4,True Blood Review,It was excellent except for two of the cd's had something wrong with them as they stopped in the middle of the episode and picked back up after a 10 second pause. Evidently there was a defect in my shipment and was disappointed since this was my first time ordering from amazon.
5,Awesome,This is awesome I refuse to spoil it for anyone so all I will say is if you like vampire shows this is a must see!!!!!
3,True Blood.... book or tv show???,I am disappointed in True Blood. I loved the Sookie Stackhouse books. I will finish watching the series because I bought it.
5,True Blood Series 1,The DVD set arrived shortly after ordering. Everything is in perfect shape! Totally satisfied with the low price! Thanks for the great gift.We are loving having the opportunity to see the beginning of this show at our own leisure!
1,true blood season 1,"im a girl from the sticks, but the vampires sucked in this one. their teeth look like they come down from a hinge in their mouth, very unrealistic.. do not watch"
3,The book is better,"I much prefer reading the books instead. After I saw this, it seemed a litte cheesey and a little sluttyish (new word)."
4,Stickler for details,"I made the big mistake of reading the book series before watching the TV series. I am a stickler for details, and we all know TV shows and movies don't always stick to EVERY detail their based-on books have (or don't have).But aside from that, this is deffinitely worth watching. If not for the funny expressions from Sookie or Tarra, then because watching someone like Alexander Skarsgard play Eric Northman is just too... Yummy... to pass up. Honest. And blond isn't even my type."
4,Great series!,Like all HBO-shows True Blood lives up to the expectations! The stories and the characters are great! Only because The Wire is best TV-show I've ever seen True Blood gets 4 stars. The Wire gets 5 ...
4,true blood the first season,I watched the second season and wanted to know how it all started? I find the series very intriging. It is wierd but makes you want to watch more of it.
4,Best show on Vampires in a while,"I was hooked from the very beginning. The show is original, sexy, with the perfect touch of horror. If you're a fan of the ""Vampire Diaries"" or the ""Twilight"" Saga, this is not for you. Exit the ""romantic"" vision of vampires as twisted poets looking for true love. This is brutal and realistic, in the same line that ""Being Human"".Ana Paquin, along with Alexander Skarsgard, gives an incredible performance. A must see."
3,True Blood Season 1,"I purchased this series after reading all of the Sookie Stackhouse novels. I had to get to the third video in the box set before, I decided this was an okay series. After reading the book; I'm not really impressed with the TV series as I am with the book series. The characters are so different from the descriptions in the book, and the fake southern voices are awful. At times, some of Sookie's and Bill's acting is just horrible. I do want to watch seasons 2 and 3; however, I will rent them this time rather than buying.If you're reading the book series, just realize this TV series is totally different from the book series."
1,Beyond Stupid,This is the most idiotic and ridiculous show that has been on in a long time. The only saving grace is that it has the occasional nudity.
3,It's different,"True Blood is a decent show. It's definitely different than I expected. I expected something like Underworld but it is more about relationships between the humans and the vampires. A couple of the characters, including the main character, are bipolar. You mostly just find yourself wanting to know how it ends and are interested in maybe one or two characters. I plan to watch the second season to see if it gets any better. Overall, it's worth a watch."
3,6th Episode of True Blood - Not My Favorite,"This is the 6th episode in the HBO adaptation of the popular Sookie Stackhouse vampire novels (the first episode isStrange Love, see my review there for the content description).People around Sookie keep dying off and it is starting to have an effect on everyone. Never too bright to begin with, Jason is just a mess with his grief and confusion caused by withdraw from ""V"" (vampire blood). This was not my favorite episode, but needed to be seen to move through the series.This series is not for everyone and definitely not for younger viewers!CFH"
1,"Disappointed: Too much drugs, sex, cursing and violence","HBO has taken a thoroughly delightful series by Charlaine Harris and warped it into just another TV soap opera chock full of drugs, gratuitous sex, foul language and B movie violence. Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire stories are imaginative, edgy and humorous. Her lead characters are appealing and vivid. I had hoped the dramatization would be truer to the tone and feel of the books. I am disappointed that HBO chose to ignore the charm of the Southern Vampire world and created just another Tony Soprano orgy of humorless drugs, sex and violence. The books are so much better and so much more enjoyable."
1,If it sounds too good to be true then it usually is,One of the dics in the package is scrached to the point it can't be viewed. So I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Ridiculous,"I checked this out to see what all the hype was about. Horror movies and even vampire stories have always been my favorites. Campy TV shows like Buffy are right up my ally. This show, however, reached a level of absurdity that I cannot tolerate. I begrudgingly made it half way through the third episode before I had to turn it off. My initial reaction to the first episode stuck through out. I didn't really care for any of the characters, the dialog was awful and the whole ""forbidden romance between a girl and a vampire"" idea has been played out, beaten up and burned down to the ground already. To be open minded, I did try to stick this out. I made it to the third episode hoping that the negative vibe I got would grow a bit. That didn't happen for me, however.Over all, this show feels like it's made for teenagers with a vampire fetish."
2,"Sorry but... This series ""Sucks""- LOL","In my opinion, the HBO series is NOTHING like the books!The characters are NOTHING like the characters in the books.AND to top it all off, the series does not follow the storylines in the books.I am currently reading book 3 Club Dead. Almost done. I am so confused after having watched this series while reading the books that I am going to go back and start the books over.They have twisted the story so much in the HBO series that it (to me) barely resembles the books. And it is only the first season!Save the money and read the books.They are really GREAT!Sorry but... This series ""Sucks""- LOL"
4,I liked it--but,"This was a very well plotted series with many plotlines and sub stories, and personally, I thought it was one of the best series I've seen in a very long time. I would give it five stars except I can't. The sex scenes were over the top. Now don't get me wrong. I love intimate love scenes, but not hard core sex, and that is what this series had. Give me Titanic or Cold Mountain any day, but gross sex that demeans women, no thank you. If the plotlines were not so good, this would have been a one star review. I'm still undecided if I will buy the second season. I want to know who's body was in the detective's car, but I'm not sure I can stomach any more gross sex."
2,Charlaine Harris WHY???,"I am a huge fan of all the sookie books. I have been waiting patiently for this series ... Can you imagine my shock with the content in the series. HBO does not always make things better. In fact the way they have done this is very upsetting to me. I'm not a prude but the content is pure raunchy sex. Some of the characters are off from the books and are doing things that if Charlaine wanted them to do, they would have done in the book. This series ranks right along with the american pie movies , she should have picked a better director because if they don't lay off the raunchy sex scenes, I won't be back for season two. Please don't assume because you love the books you will like the series. They are so bad the teenagers should not be in the room while they are playing . Sorry but this was dissappointing to me."
4,Interesting Vamp Series - Almost too racy for cable,"Good acting. Boarders on soft-core porn in the early episodes. I love the show's beginning music and scenes, it sets the tone. We pre-ordered the 2nd Season."
5,Great DVD,"Very fast shipping, I loved the DVD and cannot wait until season 2 becomes available, very satisfied, thanks"
3,"Not EXACTLY the books, but good enough","Being a HUGE Sookie Stackhouse fan, and not having HBO, I waiting excitedly for the first series to come out on DVD. Though I enjoyed the series, I enjoyed the books much more. Unlike some series where the viewer gets more out of it if they read the books, this one can stand alone and in my opinion, takes a lot more liberty with the character story lines than I prefer. Still, a great series, good effects and story plots.Not of die-hard lovers of the Charlaine Harris books."
5,"Oh, Sookie..","This is an amazingly done, wonderfully dark, brilliantly detailed series with a super- hot vampire, and a perky blonde bombshell waitress and assorted friends of each. Great plot development, a back story of every character (that's believable), and continuously rising action."
4,TrueBlood,"Highly entertaining. Good drama, good acting. Not annoying and boring (yet) like many other vampire and chick fiction shows. I feel like the whole premise is semi-original."
5,True Blood Season I,"Fantastic Series. WARNING: HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!!!! Once you've started watching it, you will crave more. Wonderfull plot and gorgeous GORGEOUS Cast."
5,fun!,"I have read the books that this series is based on, and find the show very entertaining. A little graphic with both sexual content and violence- keep your children out of viewing area:)"
3,A fan of Sookie Stackhouse but not so much this series,"The books about Sookie are great, however, the series doesn't portray Sookie like Ms. Harris does in her writing. I think since this is an HBO presentation, they take it a step further, adding all the sex and gore that Ms. Harris allows you to imagine. I also do not like the portrayal of Sookie by this actress as well as several of the other characters. I'm sure Ms. Harris isn't complaining on her way to the bank, since HBO has made this a huge success. I think if you are hoping for the book in video form, you may be slightly disappointed."
5,AWESOME!!!,Oh how I love True Blood... best way to get my fix while I wait for the new season!!!!!! Worth every penny! Soo different than the other vampire series out there!
5,fabulous show!!,"such a great show! Alan Ball never disappoints, and each episode keeps getting better. Can't wait for the second season to see what he comes up with next."
4,pretty good!,I had never seen the series and wanted to buy the first season to check it out and everywhere i went they were charging at least $40 and up for it on DVD. I paid less than half that for the whole season on Amazon - a used set but it works perfectly and i'm on to the second season already! Very nice!!
3,I Like Dalida,"Doubt I'll ever get tired of her singing voice. My problem is some of the numbers have disco backgrounds--and I just can't stand disco. Too bad. The thing that I try to do when I play this CD (and I have countless times, as the lady sure knew how to belt out a song, way better than Streisand, etc.)is tune out the [crummy] disco beat. Why did they have to do this to someone like Dalida? Why the disco background when the lady had talent? All that disco noise back in the '80s was understandable as background when the singer slacked talent (and quite a few of them just plain did not have it, with the exception of Donna Summer) but to ruin Dalida's efforts this way just makes no sense. If you're a super fan go ahead and buy it, and do what I do: pretend you don't hear the [crummy] disco, only Dalida's exquisite voice."
2,not up to their studio standard,"I was, quite frankly, disappointed with this live album. Ride sounds dispassionate and boring - quite unlike the innovative and exciting quartet I had long been used to. The few gems on the album include the infectious ""Let's Get Lost"" and the beautiful ""At the End of the Universe,"" but overall, Live Light is a weak album. For collectors only."
5,A must see,"This was definitely one of the best movies of the year for me. Fast, but well thought-through, sprinkled heavily with action sequences (I especially enjoyed Mark Dacascos and his superb martial arts training) but still not exactly an action movie. Also, the movie's pretty dark both in respect to mood and visual setting, very much like Tim Burton's The Sleepy Hollow. If you liked that movie, you'll love this one too."
4,Martial arts in France ?,"I just finished watching this movie, after i purchased in DVD, let me tell you, the action was great and the plot was really amazing, a little bit more work in the ""special effects"" (if you want to call it that, since they are computer animations) is all that it needed, if you have a digital home theater i highly recomend it, just don't look too much in the fact that indians never looked asian and that there was never martial arts in France on those days, over all, great action and fight scenes, this is a great movie."
3,The French Aristocrat Kicks Evils Butt...,"There is something vicious lurking in the woods around the mountains of France. It kills, it maims, it eats, and it is terrorizing the people of Gevaudan. On the kings orders, the royal taxidermist Grégoire de Fronsac is traveling to the area with his friend Mani, an Iroquois who is a martial arts master, to investigate the dilemma. These men spend a lot of time in the brothel while maintaining a respectable front and when they have time they perform round house kicks left and right. In all honesty, this film had potential when they began shooting it, however, somewhere in the production the director must have lost focus from the theme."
5,Excellent though a little slow moving,"This movie was an excellent film, although slow moving at times. The effects are great and the action is amazing. It's a small town being plagued by a murderous beast and two men sent by the king have come to uncover the truth and capture/kill the creature. It is not trashy horror like Nightmare on Elmstreet. The gore is in ""taste"" for lack of a better word and the acting is wonderful. This film is French, but with English dubbed over. So the mouth's don't match what's being said, but hey you get used to it after a while. I really enjoyed the film and was a well done story."
3,Missing scenes... bummer...,"I got to see this movie at the Zigfield Theater in NYC, and the initial action scene was breath-taking. When I played the DVD at home, I realized that this scene was not the same.If they re-release this movie with all the scenes restored, I'd give it a 4.5"
2,"Feast for the eyes, but turn off your brain!","Lush period piece . . . PERIOD. It features cookie-cutter characters, a crazed mish-mash of genres and styles, a painfully meandering plot (if you can call it that), gratuitous violence and over-the-top exhibitions of martial arts. The movie certainly appealed to lots of guys (including my brother) who checked their brains at the door, so I predict it'll make a fortune in DVD sales. That was probably the aim of the French: make a big-budget American-style film, throw in martial arts, add special effects . . . and make a ton of money."
4,Horror film with a twist,"Well paced horror film that keeps viewer in suspense. Some formula aspects to the film, but still very enjoyable to watch. Photography is excellent and the acting is, for the most part, outstanding."
5,dimples,"Absolutely brilliant, there should be more movies like this. Great costumes, tremendous settings, terrific acting and an excellent story to boot. The lead actors, Le Bihan, Cassell, Bellucci and Dacascos were well chosen and helped bring out the best in this movie."
3,Nice presentation of basics,"The bad news is that I bought this book to solve a specific problem. 600 pages of text and appendices later, my problem remains unsolved. Nevertheless, this is a good presentation of the basics of home networks. I use a Windows XP Home OS. There was a lot of information specific to my OS. There were also custom comments for those on Windows XP Pro, Windows 98, Mac's etc. The reader level is self-proclaimed as ""Beginning to Advanced"". It would be more accurate to say ""Beginner to Intermediate."" If you want to learn the basic concepts of home networking and some ""walk me through the commands of setting things up,"" this is a good reference. It is not an ""everything one needs for troubleshooting problems"" reference, though."
2,Not Helpful,"I was expecting more due to the title. This book tells you what to consider for your network but does little to prepare you for the technical issues you're going to encounter. Its an OK book; but certainly shouldn't be called a ""Home Networking Bible"" as it really doesn't cover very much in detail...its a wide book but also a shallow one."
3,Titanic,This was also a gift and have heard no complaints from the receipient. Have nothing else to say. Thank you.
3,"""...phasing and panning...""?",It's my understanding that this performance was recorded by (Jones?)standing in the center of the musicians while swinging a single microphone in circles to capture all of them on tape.
1,What is this?,"Sorry, but this music is horrible, you should probably chew some peyote buttoms before it makes any sense.Gave me a headache!"
4,A fitting memorial to Brian,"This album...the very pipings of Pan, the ancient and forgotten rites of Lupercalia, discovered in 20th Century Morocco by Beatnicks, Junkies and Hippies? ABSOLUTELY.The sounds made in this album send chills up my spine. This album reminds us that not only is the world stranger than we know, it is weirder than we CAN know. Everything is True. Nothing is Forbidden. These tapes will cause cold winds to blow through the canyons of your mind. The state of Pan is that of ""Panic"", and that is what you hear in these ""songs.""Mick Jagger and Keith Richards caused this album to be posthumously released after Brian Jones unfortunate drowning/murder in the swimming pool of the house where A.A. Milne wrote Winnie-the-Pooh. Brian recorded these tapes several months before his death, intending to release them."
2,sitz bath,"Item arrived OK. The bag in which the solution goes is a very flimsy material. On its very first use the neck of the bag separated from the bag. I can still put water in it but given the weight of the bag when full, I would have thought that the manufacturer would have use a heavier weight plastic. However, since it was only about 12 dollars I guess you get what you pay for. I can only give this a two rating."
2,An average TOEFL prep book with glaring weaknesses.,"This TOEFL prep book does not adequately prepare advanced students for listening, grammar, or reading problems. The content in the listening and grammar sections is off-base. Worse is the reading section which contains readings which are often less than one half the length of actual readings on the test. The book is probably suitaable for low intermediate students, but that's about it."
5,Probably the best review book for TOEFL!,"I used this book as a sole source to study for TOEFL (after browsing at least 4-5 others), did the tests from this book, Barron's TOEFL, Kaplan TOEFL, and the official ones and I got an excellent score in the real exam (my English before taking the test was high-school level). It features only high-yield grammar topics and a very good listening-comprehension section. Extremely useful especially if you don't have much time to prepare for the exam (I had 3 weeks)."
2,Waste of time and money,"I bought this book because my teacher recommended me and i thought that the real toefl test would be easy. I took the test and i couldn't believe how different it was from the book. Now i changed my teacher and i do not recommend the longman prep to anyone. If you really want to be prepared for the test, practice with the ETS and see the difference."
3,The charms were different than shown.,I was a little disappointed that the charms were different than shown. There was not a helmet nor horseshoe as shown. There were two charms with solid white and the colts horseshoe in blue.
3,It's just OK,"Good thing I didn't order a small since medium is pretty small. I have a small transmitter, and it's a VERY snug fit. May work better if you choose to hook it to your guitar strap, but since I change guitar often during a gig, it's a pain to hook up if you don't wear a belt. I bought a friction clamp so I can easily run it through a belt loop. I suppose it will provide good protection in case you drop it."
4,DTS ok with me,"I am new to DVD A and DTS. I have a brand new acura with a 10 speaker system that is capable to play both. My first DTS cd and I love it. I did notice that with DTS, it sounds best with the volume up. Clarity is impressive as much as any DVD audio CDs that I own. Dont get me wrong...DVD audios sound great but not all. I have a regular police CD and I can honestly say that there is a big difference between the two. Again, my first DTS CD and it doesn't disappoint."
5,All in one,If you like the Police then this is a great album. A super fan would have each and every CD by them but if you just enjoy most of their hits then this is your product. Not only does it have all their popular songs but the sound quality on this disk is just great. You really can not go wrong with all the songs by the Police you want and with great song quality. Highly recommended to anyone that enjoys the Police.
2,Scratched!,"Everything was good, except the last song messes up because it has a scratch on it. That is the first time somebody sent me a cd that is scratched."
3,"The import Greatest Hits is best, forget this one!!!","There's nothing wrong with the music ofcourse (5 stars!), but it's the track listing. Why did they include 2 new versions of songs (both pointless) which are on the cd already?? If you want to buy a Police compilation it must be the import Greatest Hits collection. It's easily their best single-disc compilation available (sorry, Sting & The Police career's don't mix for me and if you want an even better compilation, try the 'Message In A'- Box!). It hasn't got the 2 new versions from Message and Don't Stand... and there's no hide nor hair of Puff Daddy (thank God for small mercies!). Instead, it has 16 tracks and adds So Lonely, Bed's Too Big Without You, Synchronicity 2 and Tea In The Sahara to the usual mix, all of them much more superior than the tracks stated above. I can't understand why THAT disc isn't used as bait on the SACD-format along with the catalogue recently instead of this disc."
3,They left off the good stuff,"This CD, like the rest of the Police 'best of' CDs, suffers by exluding some of the best Police songs. A true 'classics' album would include 'So Lonely' and 'Bring on the Night.'"
5,One of the finest greatest hits releases ever!,"I'm not big on greatest hits packages. I believe the artist has an idea in mind when they release an entire album. It's like taking excerps from a great novelist's many books and putting them in one book. However, with time passed by, it appears that The Police were an excellent singles band. A lot of their albums now sound like filler around their power-pop hits. This is the CD to own, if you don't feel like buying their entire collection. The sound is a wonderful improvement over their original greatsest hits release from the 80's and the inclusion of the original ""Don't Stand So Close To Me"" finally makes this a complete package. The Police has always been one of my favorite groups. The rhythmic interplay between this trio is exciting and creative. Each one of the songs on this CD is excellent and covers the best of all their albums. One of the finest greatest hits packages ever from one of rock's most intelligent and creative forces."
1,Not DVD-Audio as advertised!!!,"The product description advertises that this disc can be played on any DVD-Audio player. I've just found this to be untrue. I can play DVD-Audio on my PC; however, upon receiving this disc, the disc itself says that one must have a DTS-compatible system to play the disc. The DVD drive in my PC is only a year old and cannot play this disc. I have more research to do, but I thought those of you considering this item should know this much..."
5,Chronicles of Narnia,I love this series. It teaches love and trust and honesty. It teaches family values and gives hope. This is a sad world anymore.
5,Old Favorite,"These are wonderful tales, I grew up on them and now at 22 I look back with a great deal of fondness. They are great for a cold rainy day to watch them straight through. Wonderful tales, perfect for all ages."
1,Not What I Expected,"Well, my fiance and I were very excited to view the old Chronicles of Narnia movies. I had the movies before but they were either lost or broken. We soon found out that there are commercials in this set of movies. That was a very big disappointment for me. Also after the commercial is over it goes through the beginning introduction of the movie. It was a big annoyance to fast forward the movie every 20min. I would not recommend this set."
1,Let's fake it.,I was very disappointed. It was my own fault. I didn't check to make sure it was the original cast not a kocck off. It was a knock off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,No.,"So many problems with these adaptaions.1) The movies are very ""BBC sound stage"" -- they come off like a Mexican soap opera.2) Poor casting of the children. Just plain awful -- the actors bear no resemblance to the book characters, and it leaves you wondering who is the powerful relative who got them the role?3) Precisely what was the problem with the original dialog and plot? The changes that have been made are NOT improvements.4) The overacting -- LOTS of exaggerated facial expressions -- very weird.5) The cheesy special effects. People in beaver costumes? People in wolf masks, roaring? People with hairy legs being fauns? Glaringly obvious animation? This series has it all. (shakes head and walks away)."
3,My kids hated it.,"I loved the books. I got the BBC movies hoping that I could convince all my kids to love it too. Bad move on my part I guess. My kids hated it. I couldn't get them to see the new theatrical release because of it, nor to read the books."
5,Love it!,"My children and I looooove this video. It is very educational and has great points that we haven't seen on other creation science videos. We love the other creation science sites, videos, books, etc., but this one is a great one to add to the collection. We also love that they acknowledge that secular evolution is just a religion. Evolutionists' view of science is based on a world without God as the creator. As Christians, we base our science on the knowledge that God's word is true from the beginning to the end, and we know the awesome truth that God created the universe. Noah is also a wonderful host, such a cutie:)"
4,Excellent quality,"I already have a two sets of these glasses--the general red and white--and am about to order another set of red wine glasses. These glasses are excellent quality, well-balanced, and thin-rimmed. Suitable both for everyday and for setting the table for guests. Riedel quality without the cost and confusion of the glass-for-every-variety line."
5,Great Classic wine glasses,I bought these to replace a set that had been diminishing over the years due to my husband's zealous dishwashing habits.It has been several months and all pieces are still intact!
4,Our everyday wine glass,"Shortly after moving to the Sonoma region, we heard Riedel glasses referenced as ""the"" wine glass by several high-end winery personnel. We first found these glasses in a wine shop in the town of Sonoma, but it was several visits before they were in stock, and we able to try them.There *is* a noticeable difference in the wine-tasting experience, enough for the better that we have junked our assortment of miscellaneous glasses, and now use these as our everyday glasses. We also have several varieties of Riedel's Vinum glasses, which get used on formal occasions, or with particularly special wine, but these have become our 'go-to' glasses.They are a bit fragile, which is the reason for 4 stars, instead of 5. However, when the enhancement of the wine experience is weighed against the number of tastings/broken-glass ratio, they are well-worth it. Shipping from Amazon has been damage-free so far."
4,"Great, but Fragile glasses","These glasses are quite nice- they definitely bring out the best in whatever reds they are served with. Considering the price, it is a bargain. Despite not having been made from crystal, the quality is outstanding for an everyday-use glass. However, be careful when handling these! I had an accident with one of the glasses the first time I used it (actually when washing it). When washing by hand, be extremely careful handling the glasses- one light tap against the sink and it broke. First time this has happened to me- sad to see it break. That's the only thing standing in the way of a 5 star rating."
2,Found it too small,I bought these Riedel glasses for the reputation of that brand. I was very pleased with the quality. However the glasses are too small to truly enjoy any wine. I recommend the Riedel Vivant model from Target instead.
4,No more brake squeak thanks Amazon!,I removed brake pads from the calipers on my Road Kinng and applied the product according to directions. Voila! No more brake squeal. Works as promised and shipping was fast as fast can be. Money well spent.
3,OK But should have spent more money.,"Easy to assemble and get to working. The adjustable flow wheel, that is also the on off switch doesn't work. You can not turn the unit off unless you take the batteries out. I still use it but cut the soap with water as it is easily clogged with thicker soap and since you can't adjust the volume, why waste half the soap. Maybe I should have spent more and got the simple human brand, but it was $17 more and had about the same number of stars. However the simple human brand has a manual dispenser button besides the motion sensor."
3,Not the best from Turtledove,"I don't want to ruin the book so i won't get into major detail:This book had some good ideas but when you get right down to it it just another, run-of-the-mill fantasy books. He does a great job in writing all the different characters but sometimes he doesn't tell us what we want to know when we want to know it. Not a great book but he does have a lot of twist and turns in the plot to make it worth the read."
3,smaller than expected,"The bell is actually a good deal smaller than I had expected. The ""Long Handle"" portion of the name is misleading. The whole bell, including the handle, is 4"" long. The bell bottom is 2.5"" in diameter, approximately. Therefore, the bell is only mediocre in loudness. But, still a good bell for the money."
1,DANGEROUS FOR BABIES!,"risk of suffocation on infants & babies, the bell's small ball was in our child's mouth!almost got suffocated!DO NO BUY IT!"
4,For Easter Vigil,I just wanted a simple bell to participate in the celebratory ringing of the bells during Easter Vigil. It's the perfect size with a pleasant tone.
3,Got it to Train the Dogs like Pavlov,"We wanted our dogs to get used to coming to dinner with a dinner bell, so we got this. It seems to work. It's not terribly loud, but I guess dogs don't need it to be. Also, it doesn't seem very heavy duty. I guess time will tell how it holds up."
5,Clear and loud!,I love how this bell has a clear and loud ring to it. You can even hear it over a classroom of noisy students. Just what I needed!
4,Nice,I liked the headbands a lot but I washed one of them and it shrunk drastically. I'm not sure how I'm going to clean the other ones I purchased because the one that shrunk no longer fits. Other than that though the colors are cool and it looks nice.
3,Little more than a good start ...,"Am a bit disappointed by the AAA 70 Piece Explorer Road Assistance Kit. In the first place, the specific reference to 70 piece is somewhat deceptive. The kit will indeed contain 70 pieces if every single band aid, etc. is counted. There are a few major pieces such as decent jumper cables, a flimsy-looking hand charged flashlight, cheap-looking flat head- and Phillips head screwdrivers (one each), etc. One could undoubtedly assemble better quality tools at a similar cost. The carrying bag is of decent quality and is luckily left with sufficient room to add one's own tools and first aid supplies (which inevitably I will. This road assistance kit is at best a decent start, but far from sufficient in even minor road assistance situations."
5,Great gift.,My nephew loved this gift as a new driver and his entire family wants one now. Has everything you need for the car.
4,pretty good,"Great value for this price.I think the only thing I will probably use is the jump up cable.The flashlight which can be powered by hand, which is great.Also there are several piece of must-have tools, covering the needs of all work I can do by myself.Duct tape seems not long enough, neither does the rubber band; and the first-aid kit, which occupies the main part of 70pc, does not look like useful."
4,Great rocking blues,"The 3 Gales brothers all play great guitar, truly a talented family. Manuel Gales took the name Little Jimmy, in honor of Jimi Hendrix. He was then ""adopted"" as the grandson of the late Albert King, and took the name Little Jimmy King. Obviously Albert also thought he could play. The album immediately punches into ""Fight the power"" and best illustrates the strength of the sounds: the inter-play between the three 'lead' guitars with greating rocking blues rhythms. 'Hand me down' also is powerful, with each player describing the progress of an old guitar handed on from father to son to brother etc and then playing their own licks. The other standouts are 'Somethin's got a hold on me' a more bluey track mixed with with great pyrotechnics, ""House of blues"", ""Sign of the times"" and ""Talking in your sleep"". I recommend the album if you like your blues uptempo with lots of guitar. If you like this album, you will probably also like Little Jimmy King's 'Something Inside of Me'."
1,Details?,"What exactly is this? People spend a lot of foot work searching for specific items and when they ""think"" the have found it they run into this type of stuff. SELLERS! Please list as much details as possible about what your selling so we know what the heck it is!!! *sigh*"
2,The Algebraist Iain Banks,"I am a Banks fan. I do prefer his fiction over his science fiction, but both entertain me. This one, though, I have started at least 3xs now, and have yet to finish."
3,Recycled Banks,"Having read all of Iain Banks' published sci-fi to date, this work provoked in me frequent feelings of déjà vu. It is not set in the Culture universe, but the culture of the Dwellers is, pretty much, the Culture all over again. The protagonist could be Gurgeh, from ""The Player of Games"", in a return engagement. A series of characters play the role of bumbling sidekick with hidden powers, which Banks has done to death by now. This new universe takes a step in the direction of hard sci-fi, with speed of light limits respected, etc. It quickly becomes apparent, however, that Banks' knowledge of science isn't sufficient to the genre - annoying gaffes abound. Altogether it's not a bad novel, but it's probably his weakest and least creative to date."
3,New Review,"I'm editing my previous review a few years later and a second time through. Five stars. Absolutely epic. More exposition than usual with Banks which is why I originally gave it 3 stars, but I'm finding now that said exposition -gasp- actually enriches and gives depth to the story. Imagine that. Greatest sci fi author of all time. Wonderful hard core space opera that is to Star Wars what Slick Rick is to Vanilla Ice. Dig it?"
3,"Thriller, not by the sci-fiction writer","This book is NOT by Robert Charles Wilson, the highly regarded science fiction writer. It is by Robert C. Wilson, a different writer altogether. That said, the book is a well constructed horror story that is likely to appeal to fans of Stephen King and his genre."
2,Okay,this is not as good as the disney version but it was okay. the actors were all right i did enjoy the performance of the lady who played the white witch. all in all it was alright
1,"dissapointing, definitely NOT for all ages","Hello! Just like to say that the video is NOT as good as the book. There are so many cheap effects. The lion Aslan is like an old old man with athritis or something... basically a big cat in a puppet suit. The characters are a big dissapointment too. The character of Lucy is too childish. Peter looks younger than Edmund. All ""special"" creatures (except dwarfs) are full-sized men or women in puppet suits (imagine the GIANT-size Beaver). The video is still too expensive. It is actually a BBC and Wonderworks production. They're the same thing, so don't get tricked if you only see ""wonderworks"". Definitely NOT for adults, you'll find it too childish and even ridiculous to look at. For the kids--stick to the book!!!"
5,A wonderful series to present to a small child,"This effort yields a production which preserves the unique humour, grace, and satirical insight which C.S. Lewis often expressed in his writing. For a parent this is a thought provoking and engrossing story to share with a young child and despite the limited budget such ventures must contend with, is still beautifully executed, never loses its focus, and will more than once draw tears from many adults who enjoyed these books as children. Admittedly this comes from an avid C.S. Lewis fan. This review is valid for the first three books I have viewed. Buy them if you can find them."
2,Total disappointment,"This movie was amazingly [dull]. I can't believe all the good reviews it got. Maybe we were watching different movies? The costumes and makeup were really bad. The acting was overdone or underdone, but never believable. Even my kids agreed it was pretty bad. I love the books and I enjoy Christian themes. But just because I want something with a religious theme doesn't mean I'll settle for something bad just because it includes some Christian allegory. Do yourself a favor and just read the book."
3,Wait For The New One,"""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is currently my daughter's favorite book series. She is excited about the planned release of ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" on December 9, 2005. In anticipation, she is viewing previously released versions. This one disappointed her.The biggest problem is the lack of ability to personify the animals in a believable way. She looked forward to seeing Aslan on screen and remarked, ""He's just a puppet. His mouth doesn't even move to his words."" At the time this film was made, on the budget with which it was made, this was an understandable weakness.But that weakness will soon be dealt with. The new film will have most of the same special effects team that created ""The Lord of the Rings""!If your children are young, get the animated version. The animated Aslan is great. If they are older, wait for the new one."
2,I love The Chronicles of Narnia...BUT,"Lewis said that he never wanted his work to be adapted to a live action film. He was concerned about how the talking beasts (such as the beavers) would look in silly costumes. He was right on the money. They looked foolish.The best thing I can say about this film is that it is true to the book, with minor exceptions.The worst thing I can say is that it was two hours and forty one minutes long! It dragged, and dragged, and dragged - and it didn't need to do so. People walked too slowly, talked to slowly, Aslan himself moved at the speed of a dying turtle. While the material presented was decent (effects aside), the pacing was horrid. It could have been just as true to the book and been *at least* forty-five minutes shorter.It's difficult for me to write a less than stellar review when the book is so dear to my heart. But here is the most salient point: I read the book in less than two hours and forty one minutes. So..."

3,Dark for a lighthouse,Jeanette Winterson is a gifted author and this is a very artistic novel but I found it too dark for my taste.
5,sun-tsu,"Outstanding book in it's logic & presentation. However, the small physical size was a bit of a suprise."
1,Little Book - Big Rip-Off,"If you are expecting a real book, this little, imitation book will certaintly be a disappointment. It is a rip-off.The review that praises this rip-off for the ""Secret Wisdom"" of its small size is certainly proof of the old adage: ""You can fool some of the people some of the time."" Or, maybe it is was written by the publisher who would really like to fool all of the people all of the time."
1,Not Worth The Time,"This book is not worth the time it takes to read. I was optimistic when I purchased the book based on the positive experience of other titles by the publisher. However, this book is poorly written. It appears rushed and does not spend the time needed to explain/expand key ideas/concepts.There isn't a single graphic depiction in the entire book which is dedicated to IS audit. There are numerous typos and the writing style can get monotonous and difficult.I generally find books on IT and audit as interesting but this one put me to sleep every time. The material was written in such an uninteresting and boring manner that my mind constantly wandered to other topics. The book definitely did not keep my interest.I generally keep these exam review books as reference guides in my jobs. This one is going back on re-sale - assuming someone buys it after reading these reviews.Very disappointing."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this book -- unfortunately before I read the reviews here -- to prepare for the CISA. Despite the optimistic title, the book fails to deliver in just about every area. The book is not connected to the exam in any logical form or structure. One of the biggest draws for a book like this is the practice test software. Sadly, this book fails yet again. The software works, but the questions in some cases are just plain wrong! I wrote to the editor and they offered me an errata sheet that I could use to spot mistakes in their data???? What good is that? My advice is that you skip this book, avoid this author, and not patronize this publisher since they are not willing to make good on their promises."
3,Not for reference,"I was looking for a reference to assist in passing a ridiculously tough exam, and this was not it. I recommend you simply get a copy of the test exam and run it over and over to get a feel for the way the test writers chose to score. The CISA exam is a remarkably subjective exam, and really depends on the frame of mind the writers were in while choosing which answer would be ""correct""...I passed the first try by simply running through the test questions a time or two. But on the other hand, I am a phenomenal test taker (I used to ace college tests without ever having studied or even shown up to class...) so take it as you will."
1,"Too many errors, ambiguous writing style.","I abandoned this book quickly and used other sources to prepare for the CISA. There are too many errors and the writing style often seems ambiguous. There are even blatant errors in the explanation of answers section.Like others have said, this publishing company put out a good product for the CISSP and a very poor product for CISA prep."
4,kicking,i thought that the album was fast paced and very thought out the only bad parts are the first song was to long ans Dis Miester was just messed other than that it was a great album buy it man
4,Essential for any Rammstein fan,Rammstein's music has changed a lot since this albumn was published. If you are a hardcore fan then this albumn is essential.
5,One of the best new bands I've listened to!,These guys have some of the best guitar riffs that I've heard in a long time. It was about time somebody came up with great music like this!!!
1,Fairly disappointed,"Being a fan of Dickie Goodman I was immediately interested in picking up this book. Halfway through it however I found my self cringing at the amount of personal information about the author. If I wanted to learn about JON Goodman I would have searched for a book about him instead, not that there would ever be one. It is sad to say, but the best part of the book was the foreword by Dr. Demento. I have never been more disappointed in a publication and I want my $31 back."
1,Nice.,I like it. Makes a good frisbee or coaster. Not such a good read though. Poorly worded and edited by a 15-year-old. Unfortunate endeavor. Great frisbee.
4,It's good but expensive.,"All glucosamine products are expensive, not just this one. I don't have 11 more words. erxtcy dtfcyvu drt y serxtcy"
2,The Miracle Medicine?,I bought Trigosomine after reading an article in the newspaper. I have a daughter with Spina Bifida that has a lot of pain. Also a Mother with arthritis. From what I can see it does not work like the miracle drug that was advertised.
2,No Help,Not sure how long you have to take is product to see some results. I've been taking it for a month now and see no improvement in my knee. It may be working to some extent but not enough to help relief the pain. I will not waste my money on any further bottles.
5,Courage: The Backbone of Leadership,I began this book in a borrowed book and about 20 pages into it I decided to buy one for my husband who is in politics and one for our son-in-law who is a business leader. It is a wonderful help for anyone who wants to do the right thing!
2,Not as Advertised,"I had tried a Ga.ma straightener previously from a friend and loved it, so I thought I'd buy my own. The biggest perk for me was that it worked for both European and US voltages so that I could travel with it without any problems. However when I received the straightener, it did not satisfy the product description. The wattage was 85 not 170, and the voltage were 220 not 100-240. Moreover, the straightener takes a *long* time to heat up. Even after 5 minutes, my straightener still flashes the red light that indicates it's still heating.I contacted Goodman's (the seller) and they told me that they don't even sell straighteners that work in Europe, despite that they advertise the 1001HP that way.The Ga.ma straightener that I borrowed from a friend was one of the best straighteners I've ever used. It's unfortunate that the ones sold in the US are not the same."
4,I love Saint's stories.,"Entertaining, moving, even transforming. Very well photographed. It was a good learning experience.Thank you for this kind of movies!"
2,Saint Philip Neri,The best movies I have ever seen. Good lesson for current church as well. Very good guidance for all Christians.
1,The Border Guide,"Ordered the latest edition (Edition #8) and they sent out Edition #7. I had to buy the book retail,"
3,"Looks nice, but the measurements are inaccurate","It looks nice, but isn't actually useful to accurately measure how tall your kid is. The ""ruler"" stitched on didn't match up with a tape measure. Also I'm not sure how to mark measurements on the fabric. Velcro didn't stick."
2,"Cute, but not very functional","This growth chart is very cute, however, it is difficult to make marks on the fabric when measuring your child because it is a little fuzzy. Also, it is hung by hanging the loop on a nail, but it really needs to be fastened more securely. My son pulled on the growth chart a couple of times and it stretched out the loop, which throws off where the measurement markers fall. It wasn't accurate anymore. It's an ok growth chart, but if I was doing it again I'd buy one that was laminated or thicker paper that can be marked on and rolled up and kept when the child grows up."
2,It is Erotic...,"I can't say I was all that impressed with this read. I thought for sure, with all the stellar reviews, that I was going to love it. In all honesty I read it in a few hours (it's about 140 pages long), and there wasn't much in the way of plot. Dak, a seven or eight foot alien comes to earth to take his life mate, Geris, after his Emperor claimed Geris' best friend as his life mate. Geris is mauled by Dak, aliens with butts for heads (I'm not lying) and little men that roam around and survive on fluids from a female. I suppose that's what made it erotic, but the sex between Dak and Geris was rather vague. There was a little humor that helped, but honestly you would be better off doing a search on the Internet for free erotic literature than spend eight bucks on this. I liked the premise of life mates and big, beefy men (who doesn't?) but the presentation fell a little short for me."
4,:0),I liked it i thought it was just right as a follow up to Kyra's friend Geris. Dak was a loveable guy i like the way the story went along. I almost didn't buy the follow ups because of the bad reviews they got but i took a chance and liked them.Take a chance if this is your type of book it's readable.PS: Try to get a better used book rate.
5,I think this album...excellent!!.....recommend it 2 anyone!!,"I think this is probably one of the best albums that I have ever bought to be quiet honest. I like the euro-dance scene, and I feel E-type have given it something that is unique!! Recommend this to anyone, it helps to lift you up. It is also very special to me because I first encountered E-type music in Finland - it helped to make it a magical place!!!!"
5,"E-type , one of the BEST Euro-Dance groups",Hey man this stuff is AWESOME! I dont know what you're talking about but E-type is one of the BEST Euro-Dance groups out there! I most definitely recommend this CD.
5,I enjoyed this item over and over. I am a great fan of the doctor,I enjoyed this item over and over. I am a great fan of the doctor
1,No size given.,"I need cane tips but how can I order them if you don't care enough to tell us the size? Is it 1"" or 3/4"" or 5/8""? Many of the other cane tips are the same. So I'd be a fool to order them."
5,Best table top.,"I have had this tripod for about a year. The main reason I purchased it, was a review I read on another site. It does everything it is supposed to do very well. I carry my camera in a small video camera bag. Folded down the tripod fits in my bag. The tripod is very stable and quality construction. Also I have taken very nice night(extended aperture) pictures."
1,"Practically useless, but it looks good.","Received this last week, thinking I could clear up some space inside my HTPC. WRONG, this thing has some screwed up temperature sensor. After 15 minutes of heavy disk usage, the temperature alarm goes off and halts the drives; screeching like a smoke alarm. I talked to ICY dock tech support and was told, ""It can take 5, but most people only use 3 drives maybe 4 max. Also it's designed for 5400RPM IDE drive not 7200 or higher."" First of all the tech guy called it ""IDE,"" second only designed for 5400rpm!Stay away, I'm sending this back as soon as I can."
3,Inexpensive SATA drive bay suffers from rattling,"This drive bay works quite well; however, the drives fit very loosely into the bay. One of the bays RATTLED whenever hard drive seeks happened, so I jammed some paper between the drive bay cartridge and the walls of the drive bay; no noise now.Seek time in drives is definitely affected by mechanical vibration; I give this product three stars due to the poor construction and loose fit of the drives."
4,Be Creative,"I wasn't too thrilled with the French manicure set this came with, but individually, the nail polishes are great.I used this one to paint my nails all white. After the polish was dry, using a toothpick, I 'drew' pictures on my names. It was a fun little thing and several people commented on my nails.Be creative, just because this polish is for a French manicure, that doesn't mean you have to use it for that. :c)"
2,Poor Editing (sample code),"After reading only part of this book, I have found numerous typos. Most of these are just in the text though, not sample code. A bigger issue is that the sample code from the book does not match the sample code provided on the CD (even some of the chapter numbers have been switched). In some cases the code in the book and on the CD is incorrect! After spending some time at MSDN, I was able to find and fix the problems. Not what I expected when I bought this book."
5,"Yum, yum, eaten-up",I buy these animals in bulk and take 5 to 10 bags to work each week as I found that the dispensing machines are more expensive and unreliable. Occasionally I turn out empty pockets and it is nice to know I have a stash at arms reach.I know that now days many people like the heaver chips. But I grew-up on the thinner Lays's. I consider these chips one of the basic food groups. I also like bulk delivery as it is like Christmas all year around.
3,"Sparse, but good.","I'm used to listening to Neil Finn's more recent albums and most of his music sounds pretty ""full"" (multiple instruments, background vocals, etc). This album was a little on the mellow and sparse side, but it is still definately worth buying if you're a fan."
1,Finn,"The Finn Brothers never fail to amaze me. More well known as members of Split Enz and Crowded House. Some very interesting pieces here....they're always moving forward. Try this one and then go on to ""Everyone is Here"""
3,leo sayers cd,"CD arrived on schedule and was what I expected. Quality was average in sound.I was not disappointed in Amazon or its ability to fill my order.Sincerely,Jerilyn Beaupre"
3,Good!,I have this Best Of Leo Sayer CD and I like it. My favorite song is More Than I Can Say which was the main reason I bought the CD!
2,I have lived a thousand years,"I Have Lived A Thousand Years is about a Jewish girl who a has to go to a Nazi camp. She has to give up all she has and is treated horribly. Her dad dies when she is away at a Nazi camp. When she comes back to her home after she has been liberated her house is all dusty. Then they went to America to go to school and stay together as a family. I thought that this was an interesting book. Some parts were boring though because, it was all about the same type of stuff. I felt really bad for her. So all in all this was an alright book."
1,I Have Lived a Thousand Years,"This is a review on the book I have Lived a Thousand Years. The book was written by Livia Bitton-Jackson.The setting takes place in Germany during World War2. In this book there are two main characters. Elli a girl that is tall, skinny, smart, and poetic. Mom is the other character that stays with Elli through out the war. In this book Elli experiences some tough times in Auschwitz a death camp. some of the things she had to fight through are starvation and torture. The theme of this book is racism and war are bad. I can prove this because the jews didn't want war but the Germans did. I would recommend this book to any World War2 buff that wants to hear a Jews perspective of the war and see how the war unfolded. The book I would compare this to is Parallel Journeys because both books give a Jews perspective on the war. I didn't like I Have Lived a Thosand Years because all it talked about was Elli and her poems."
5,A wrenching story of survival in Auschwitz.,"This wrenching, searing story of the pain, cruelty. andsuffering of a young Jewish girl in Auschwitz is the truestory of author Livia Bitton-Jackson, born EllieFriedmann in Czechoslovakia.Ellie Friedmann was just thirteen when she and hermother were taken to the Auschwitz concentrationcamp. Despite pain, suffering, and terrible livingand working conditions, Elli and her mother managedto stay alive, and the one thing that kept themgoing through the worst of times is the dream thatone day their family would be reunited again.Destined to take its place among the finest ofHolocaust literature."
4,Great watch!,"This watch was for my husband's birthday. He has had a Polar monitor for a while, but this has more features. I didn't get the foot pod at the time, but will soon. He likes the sleek look and that the time is very easy to see while running. I disagree with the other reviews about it being ""cheap plastic""--most watches of this type are plastic or a synthetic rubber. The band size was easy to adjust, and all in all he loves it!!"
3,Une Bonne Compilation... Mais Pas Un Best Of,"""Love Like A Man"" est une compilation originale par son contenu et le choix de ses pièces mais ce n'est pas un album Best Of.Essentiellement les pièces choisies proviennent d'albums et d'enregistrements ""post-Woodstock"" (1970-75). Par conséquent, ""Love Like A Man"" s'adresse avant tout aux fans, aux connaisseurs et aux collectionneurs du groupe. Le plaisir est au rendez-vous sur ce disque."
5,Wouldn't do study abroad without it,"I bought this book as a last minute purchase - I wish I had bought it earlier as it included a lot of information in selecting a place to study overseas, plus a lot on how to pack, what to take and a really good overview of the university system in Britain. I took the book with me and it was in daily use in the first few weeks as me and my new friends tried to figure out how to open bank accounts, where to go shopping, how to phone home - all those things you never expect to be different in a country that speaks the ""same"" language - but where things are just done differently. It really helped me settle in much faster and get more out of the experience - even suggesting what to expect on your return home.I would certainly recommend this book to anyone going on study abroad to Britain."
3,Sturdy good toy,"This is a well made product, my daughter likes the cups the best, doesn't ""fish"" very much. Likes to sink the boat. It could be priced lower because it really doesn't do much. Overall, it's still a good toy."
3,Useful and useless at the same time,"This item comes with three components. There is a handrest that I totally don't use. I don't want it to get my laptop sticky and it looks like it could come off easily. The microfiber sleeve is nice but it has no protection or cushioning which is what I'd really like to find for my new 15"" MacBook Pro. I use the sleeve when transporting my laptop but that's only because I haven't found a real protective case yet. The only truly useful part of this item is the keyboard cover that I use religiously to keep the keyboard and screen protected while the lid is closed."
4,Skint Boss Chips In,"Four long years after Brassic Beats Vol.1, Damian ""Midfield General"" Harris finally comes out with an album. Most people are going to buy this album for DEVIL IN SPORTS CASUAL and/or REACH OUT. The unusual (and refreshing) thing about this album is that no type of song is duplicated. With REACH OUT we get a taste of beautiful soul, DEVIL... is a blistering breakbeat song, STIGS INN LOVE is a classical piece with a quick little beat, and so on, there's even a country song!(of sorts)If you like every or anything SKINT has already put out, especially Indian Ropeman, a major contributor to this album, you'll like it. Enjoy."
2,A Boring Universe,"Death stars and galaxies. Cool. Quasers. Neat. This book. Boring.I recently read this for the NM Battle of the Books and found it dense, highly technological, and full of scientific information. If a person was interested in this subject, it would provide a good overview of many things found in space. However, as a casual read or even for classroom use, I could not recommend this book.The writing is dull and reminiscent of a poorly written textbook where too much information is crammed into too small a space. A better format for young adults, the target audience, would be less information with accompanying pictures, vocabulary definitions, and personal accounts.This book might be more acceptable to upper high school students and college students with a particular interest in science, but as a young adult book it deserves to be devoured by a black hole and regenerated as new matter."
1,A Huge Disappointment!,"I thoroughly enjoyed Tears of the Giraffe by Alexander McCall Smith and couldn't wait to read his latest effort, 44, Scotland Street.However, I did not enjoy Scotland Street at all! It meandered along and raised issues that seemed irrelevant or were never resolved.I found the characters uninteresting, the story never seemed to develop any sense of direction and towards the end I tired of all the self indulgent waffle and found myself speed reading and skipping huge chunks of text in a mad dash to reach the last page.I know he has a loyal readership so he must appeal to someone, but no more Alexander McCall Smith for me, thank you!"
5,Entertaining!,I enjoyed 44 Scotland St. It was very entertaining with lots of interesting characters. I want to get the whole series.
5,Hi im cool,hi im joey mctroutsd. i hate this basbal. my daddy hats it to. i broke it on the fist day i got for my birf day. my dadda was cring.
2,nothing new in this film,"While it certainly looked interesting, the story unfortunately uses a lot of words to say nothing new.I'm voting 1/5 because of Redford's direction of Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise; I found their characters very believable and found the casting perfect. Cruise as the senator looks like a smart a$$ (pardon the expression) and Streep is perfect as the journalist.And the final 1/5 is for Philippe Rousselot's cinematography work.Not as interesting as it could be.Watch only if you must."
1,Save your $$$,A Political Science 101 lecture and a huge disappointment from such a star-studded cast. No more to say about this one I'm afraid.
2,"Redford's Ambitious talk-a-thon,not compelling for the screen","LIONS FOR LAMBS preached and talked me out.I was exhausted looking at talking heads (albeit it really famous ones) when I would have rather ""heard"" this film over NPR Radio! Fortunately,its 80+ minutes was about all I really could have stood from Redford's unengaging cinematic approach to LIONS FOR LAMBS.I am not suggesting that what this film has to say is anything at all that I would personally disagree, it 's just simply I found the style of the film 100% un-cinematic and uninteresting.Frankly, a documentary such as NO END IN SIGHT was IMO far more compelling than this turkey,Streep,Cruise,Redford or no Streep,Cruise,Redford; their presence does not make this a great film to watch just like the recent remake of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.Doesn't the old saying go,""Children should be heard and not seen""?....well, if it doesn't it should!Glad I got to see this at a free screening.It was a major disappointment!"
4,sweet sweet nice,"I thought she was only a good actor.Well this is absolutly great,i was so glad to hear something like this becouse mtv sucks.Just as good Punk rock as Sahara hotnights,The Sounds, Hellacopters...This is my taste 10 times over,i love it.Wonderful voice at least on recordings dont know about live?Favorite songs are:Long Road Out Of HereYou're Speaking My LanguageI Never Got To Tell YouThank you Juliette for another great american band."
5,Awesome for any rock-n-roll fan!!!,"I was a little sceptical at first. I love Juliette Lewis' acting but I wasn't sure she'd have a voice, let alone any musical talent. Was I ever wrong. I love every song on the album. The sneering lyrics, and the hard beats really drive this record to the top. I haven't seen the band live as of yet, but when I finally get a chance, I can only assume it will be an awesome experience. Everyone should buy this record. This is no Ashlee Simpson!!! It's reall music!"
2,Needs work,"I love juliette Lewis love her voice but the music needs to improve.. out of the whole album the only song that got my attention was ""you're speaking my language"" kicks ass. can't say the same for the rest of the songs.."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,I have a friend who has one in a different style and was excited when I found one that I could buy. It's perfect. I found a long chain and have worn it several times. I'm satisfied with the puchase and would do busines with the seller again in a heartbeat.
4,Works for me,"I take this as an alternative to Xanax. It works for me, though it's affects are short lived (~30 minutes). I've never had any side effects with the product."
4,Hard to find Kava,"Kava is for relaxation and Slight anxiety. I have Restless Leg Syndrom, trouble staying in bed. Kava is part of my night-time meds. It helps. European studies said if you take a lot of it it MIGHT be harmful, so the USA recommended it be hard to find and buy. I've taken it for years with ne side effects. 2 pills 1 hour before bedtime."
2,There are better stress management products available,"I thought the Kava Kava Extract was okay--until I tried Valerian.Nature's Way Valerian, 90 Capsulesis significantly more effective for me in managing my stress. I know everyone reacts differently to different products, but I recommend the Valerian over the Kava because it really works for me. In comparison, the Kava really doesn't measure up."
4,Great Collection,Lost Pearls is a great collection of songs that were put into storage in the 70s and didnt appear on any ash albums of this time. Andy Powell got one of his chums to collect the original tapes from storage and with the help of Martin Turner who produced this album after getting the original tapes transferred to digital.Excellent production and great crisp sound.Some of the songs are quite rocky which will appeal to most Ash fans.If you liked Wishbone Ash in the later seventies you will really get into Lost Pearls.
4,Vitamin K creme plus use shows some improvement,"JASON Vitamin K Creme Plus does improve the healing process of bruising and dark circles under the eye. I saw marked change after the third patient week of using it in morning and night. It is not a very good moisturizer but that is because it is targeting a particular function and has natural ingredients such as horsetail extract, marigold, and echinacea. Vitamin K, beyond brand name, is used by doctors to alleviate bruising so it makes sense to forego the expensive mega-cosmetic brands that SAY they have improvement results. Other brands seem to have a whole bunch of useless fillers at twice the price. Do be careful when buying Vitamin K creme as some will contain other chemicals that may cause skin irritation and especially be careful around the delicate skin around the eyes. Use this JASON creme under a light moisturizer like Lubriderm and you should have no skin irritations and improved results. Good luck!"
1,UGH!,I bought this creme 3 weeks ago and have used it twice a day ever since...that is until yesterday! I woke up with redness under my left eye that itched like there was no tomorrow. Now the right eye is the same. This product is not worth it. I wished I would have never purchased it.
2,2 stars for attempt,"I bought this excitedly today anticipating the effects it'd have on my light undereye circles. I put it on and waited several hours before I looked in the mirror. I noticed that my undereye circles were suddenly more pronounced. (To be clear--I wasn't anticipating immediate results but was checking for any sort of reaction.) So I went online and read a few more reviews. I must have not been paying close attention before, as I did not see all the reviews noting increased redness and allergic reactions. I went immediately and rubbed it off. My skin has a slight redness but no itching or bumps. The area around my eyes looks very sensitive, as though I've been crying and rubbing the sensitive skin around my eye.I am returning this tomorrow to the local organic grocery store and purchasing Vitamin K capsules instead. Too weary of this product; I will not try this again."
2,ok,I expected more- not a very strong book and I bet no one optioned this story-there are much better from the author
2,Understanding terrorism,The book came to me with the binded end all torn up. The book did not look new since it did not come in a protected envelope when it was mailed to me.
2,Never got to wear them,Was excited to get these in the mail in time for St. Patty's day. Went to put them on and one of them snapped off of the clasp. Only reason that I am giving the 2nd star is because the return/refund process was so smooth.
5,Great variety of rockin' entertainment with soul and heart,"Enough well-paced variety to keep in the cd changer. Something for all kinds of rock enthusiasts to enjoy here. Women will love Grillos's soulful and sultry, aggressive style."
1,Typical L Subramanian - Terrible,"Saraswati is a wonderful raga. But L Subramaniam has not done enough justice in bringing out the complete structure of the raga. He has concentrated more on the aspects of speed, tala and rhythm, completely ignoring melody and imagination, thus making this album bland and boring like the rest of his compositions. The mridangam is again, just as cliched as the violin is. In summary, it is Typical ""Terrible"" L Subramanian!"
2,Sucks,"Where to start? First, this hair colro was WAY darker than it suggested.Second, as I rinsed it out my hair felt like straw. My hair has NEVER felt this way even after other commercial dyes. I had to trim the ends off of my hair myself after I dyed it because it was so dried out. Now I will have to drench my hair in product every day until this color I don't even want grows out and my natural hair comes back."
5,Best Permanent Hair Colorant that i have ever tried in my life.,My sister and i are gonna order this item again in future. We never had/tried a Permanent Hair Colorant is so good like this one before so we gave it 5 stars.
4,naturtint,"Great product without ammonia - doesn't burn you eyes or your scalp - you can leave the bathroom door closed while you color - doesn't have strong odor or fumes. Scent is what I call neutral, it is not unpleasant. Does cover the gray very well, even at the tempels. It is hard to find the right color, will have to experiment. This color came out almost black on me at first, but did lighten a bit and softened. It cost me $16 at HEB. Does change the texture of your hair and tends to dry it out. The change in texture makes your hair appear thicker, but makes it feel kind of wierd too.You might want to use a good quality conditioning treatment often with this hair coloring product."
3,Just Your Average Natural Hair Dye,"I wouldn't say this product is terrible, but it's not excellent either. It's more average than anything else. I bought it a few times and then started looking for another natural hair coloring method.PROS: Product covers well, it's as easy to apply as any other conventional boxed hair dye, and the color sets quickly.CONS: VERY one dimensional (and because of that it looked like I dyed my hair even though I chose a shade very close to my natural color). Also, it damaged my ends faster (I was surprised at this because henna doesn't damage my ends, but this product did).IMO, if you are looking for a more natural alternative to boxed hair colors, then I'd consider this brand. Being that I'm a dark brunette, it just looked too unnatural and was mildly damaging to my ends, so I'll look for something else."
2,Would have just gone lighter,"I got this to make my brown hair look darker. It does look exactly like in the photo unfortunately. It was way blacker than I was hoping for, it's a Jet Black. I just hope it will fade away and be lighter over time. I want to go lighter I think next time."
4,Interesting.,"This is definitely a nice knife to have for a collection. Although it's a little on the small side to be very practical for every day use, it's still a great item to have in the glove box or in a desk drawer for those times when you just need something to cut with. It's razor sharp and holds an edge really well."
3,Funny but inconsistent,"The musings of David Rakoff are thoroughly examined in this collection of essays on various topics. While a few sections spur laugh out loud responses and others are really interesting, it wasn't a page-turner by any means."
2,Not as good as Fraud.,"I was so excited when I saw David Rakoff was publishing another book. Fraud was, to me, mindblowingly clever and funny. While I thought the first story, ""Love it or Leave It"", in Don't Get Too Comfortable was as well-written and hysterical as all of the stories in Fraud, I didn't think the rest measured up. If you've read Fraud, don't expect more of the same from DGTC. If you haven't read Fraud, what are you waiting for????"
3,Not what I was expecting,"This was book well-written and often humorous. However, I was expecting more of a ""sociology"" book, and what I got was what felt like a memoir with social commentary. If that's what you're looking for, you'll love this book!"
2,Just not all that amusing,"If you are going to have a pissy, gay, ex-Canadian New Yorker write about what is wrong with the USA, especially its overconsumption and extravagant wealth, then the book produced better be funny. This one isn't. Instead, it just comes across as pissy. The first few dozen pages or so have some amusing little vignettes, but after a while, one realizes that these stories go nowhere. Reminds me of another dud I recommend readers avoid: Red Lobster, White Trash and the Blue Lagoon."
2,The tone makes it unreadable,"I've been a long time fan of Rakoff; his poetry is absolute genius. But I had a very difficult time making my way through the vitriol in this book. He writes more like a political pundit than a comedian and the tone completely turned me off. I couldn't make it more than halfway through the book. If you enjoy Rakoff's contributions to public radio, consider Sedaris or Auslander, instead."
2,Disappointment,I watched this and of course i have seen every episode so watching this was upsetting. they add a few new clips but nothing in the movie was worth the movie. its all seemed like things they could have used for deleted scenes. it ddoesn't explain much its mostly about the cavil and him throwing a fit. if u could rent it i would don't waste your money.
1,Not Worth Your Money Or Your Time,"This DVD is a cheap ploy to squeeze more money from fans who were deprived of a decent show beginning in Season 3. There is only one major revelation here -- and that happens in the first 5 minutes. There is no need to to purchase this DVD. It is simply a re-stringing of key scenes through the first 281 ""days"" or so of the show, with a few new scenes thrown in that add little or no value. Ron Moore and the executives at Universal should be shot out a launch tube on the Galactica set for this. If I could return it, I would. It's not worth the money or the time."
3,Good for BSG Fans,"I enjoyed ""BSG: The Plan"" for what it was: a way to squeeze a little more out of Battlestar Galactica. The series is over and the story has been told, so how else can there be new stories? With a clip show, of course.Make no mistake, this is a clip show. A good percentage of what you see in this movie is stuff you've already seen. Many of the characters you grew to love in the show only show up here in clips (such as Starbuck). There is a good percentage of new stuff as well. You see a lot more of what happened with Anders and Co. on Caprica, and it's interesting to see the two Cavil's in their respective handling of the human survivors.This is not outstanding BSG. It is good BSG. It is a clip show. It is worth it to see, but not one you might watch over and over again.I enjoyed it, but may never watch it again. There ya go."
3,A clip show with a few short extra scenes,A bit disappointed with this since it was mostly clips from other shows with a very short bit of extra shots.
2,Didn't like it,"I thought it would be a good movie, instead it was like watching out takes from the show. Disappointed to say the least. It was blocky and thrown together, not much consistancy to it. I will be more watchful the next time there is a ""new"" movie out after a series closes. It seemed to take pieces from some of the better shows on the series and tape them together, it was nice to see the parts but it was kind of like an ""I have been here before"" feeling.It would have been better if they released it at a cheaper rate, like the best of Battlestar Galactica movie, maybe."
2,A glorified clip show,"I was disappointed at the end of ""The Plan."" Even though some of the special effects, like the battlestars in orbit, were spectacular to see the film overall left me feeling like I could've loaded the pilot."
1,"Too much pr0n, too little content","Although it shows an interesting perspective regarding a couple points--such as that the original goal being the recovery of the Final Five, and the Four's storyline and the discussion between Four's widow and Chief Tyrol--I would not recommend it. It seems like only 60% new material, and the rest is like a summary documentary to show you what happened in the first 2 seasons. It's not worth the money, and the nudity is completely pointless. Razor was also ""not rated"", but it was clean. But with Edward James Olmos' direction on Caprica and The Plan, I have to say I'm never going to buy a straight-to-DVD BSG movie again. If a movie is made for SciFi channel or for the theaters, then it might be ok. But this is not something you can watch with your family."
1,"Pathetic, best-of BG plus the Cavil full of hatred","In short: Do not buy, but rent or borrow it if you have hopes. I am sad to have spent money.My hopes were disapointed, all of them.This too long feature brings mostly re-used scenes from throughout the series and adds a lot of ""that's what happened in the room next door at the same moment"", where (caution, spoiler!, as if it mattered) the hate-driven ""number one"" Cylon Cavil plots to destroy mankind. Yeah, as if we hadn't known. Very minor aspects are revealed here, the story is thick and slow, and if you haven't seen the series, you sit and wonder what the hell happens. I was bored from start to end.So, if you already thought the end of season 4 was terribly dumb, expect MUCH worse from this one, it is neither entertaining nor impressive. It is there to make money with. Gods, undo this."
3,Not neccessary to BSG's plotline.,"Avoid it if you have to pay for it, it's just not necessary and does not add anything to the show."
3,"A Look at the Making of ""The Plan""","This short is a quick look at the making ofBattlestar Galactica: The Plan, and mostly focuses on Edward James Olmos as the director. There is also a behind the scenes look at the filming of a pivitol event in the movie (which can also be found in the ""extras"" on the DVD). ""The Plan"" uses a lot of footage from the series, but new scenes were added to expanded the plot with elements we learned later.There isn't a lot to be learned from this, but fans might want to take a look before viewing the movie."
2,What plan?,"Maybe I just had higher expectations than was reasonable, but I found this to be a terribly disjointed collage of individual moments intended to fill in gaps of certain characters and scenes from BSG. There was no symmetry to it at all. It focused largely on the lives of the 5 'parent' cylons during and after the attack, and also on the failed plan of the cylons to eradicate the human race in one sweeping blow. (that was 'The Plan' btw, destroy humanity, like we didnt know that). The Plan having failed we see the cylons trying to move forward with their hunt for humanity.I was hoping for a more comprehensive fill-in-the-blanks type of story like Razor, which did a great job telling the story of the Pegasus. This wasnt a coherent story as much as it was a series of short cut-scenes pasted together. I expected better."
4,not that much new,"This mini-movie just recaps all four seasons of BSG from the Cylon's point of view. There are a few new revelations, and some things that didn't make sense in the TV series are explained, but overall there isn't much new here - it's just an alternative POV recap."
3,Good but Disjointed and Could be Better,"Very interesting and does answer some Questions about the original series but not all. Probably because Caprica is coming out to address the beginnings. The Plan would have been better as a Bonus Feature DVD to a DVD ""series set"" rather than a standalone movie. BUT I enjoy BSG, so like a junkie, I want more and more of BSG. I had the same feeling about Avatar, both really great. So please keep my BSG stuff coming even if it's a little disjointed or mediocre. I'm hooked. But please try to make it better than the The Plan."
2,"Battlestar Galactica ""The Plan""","""The Plan"" is a spliced together mishmash of out-takes and quickly produced snippets that try to bind them all together. It purports to be new backstory though most of the info is already out there. Mildly entertaining to the real BG fan but likely to be a bust with the less devout."
3,Not for the average viewer,"If you just enjoy BSG and are not a fanatic like most of my friends you probably won't enjoy this film that much. It does answer a few questions that were left lingering, but the answers really aren't going to give you that epiphany feeling. Its like those episodes of other sci-fi shows that have a compilation of flashbacks to try and save money and squeeze an extra episode out to meet a quota. Consider renting it later, esp since its been going down in price. Amazon gave me a refund for a price drop after the pre-order price and now its already down another 3 dollars."
1,Written and Directed by a toaster,"A soul free, super boring re-cap of the series with lame new footage shot to throw in between existing footage you've already seen. Boy did it suck, and I was a big fan of the entire series. Razor was so great, but this is just plain awful and unnecessary. It's like one of those lame ""remember when we did this"" episodes of a sitcom that always sucked so bad."
4,Interesting,"Not as weak as people seem to make out, this offers some thought provoking insight into the series. Plus it's more galactica which is always good news!"
3,Just wasn't good enough...,"Come on now, if it's supposed to bookend the entire series, why put so much footage of things we've already seen? It was meant for us to get a clearer purpose of the plan and in certain ways, it did and in other ways, it was just a little rushed and deserved to be a whole lot better than it was. Don't get me wrong, I really thought the series was top notch and that it will be considered one of the best remakes ever created but this just wasn't what I was expecting. I do hope that IF they do revisit this series that it'll be a lot more satisfying than the effort that was created in this particular piece."
5,Giving insight into the Cylon mind!,"Giving us a view into the mind of the Cylon was a real treat. To see how they think and how they considered their former masters was really insightful. The plot was well written and the characters were well defined. The actors were an A+ and it was nice to see more of the Simon model, as well as all the different personalities of each model! I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed or loved Battlestar Galactica!"
1,sore dissapointment,"This is a hotch-potch (hodge-podge?)of mostly previously viewed scenes during BSG seasons, with a bit of ""controversial"" topless scenes to save face if you into that, and just a couple of really new material about the actual bombing of the colonies. Terrible waste of time, and this from someone who fell hard for BSG the remake. Not only you won't get answers, you won't even get intelligent questions- then eventually I realized none of the former producers is on the credits, and it really shows. Sorry Caprica."
2,Downhill since Season Three,"This thing was completey downhill since Season Three, culminating with the atrocious finale and this film only demonstrates the hopeleness of the situation."
2,"Good item, description needs updated!","I have no problems with the quality of this product. The issue is that it is described as fitting a MacBook Pro. That may be true of older models, but I have a brand new MacBook Pro and this does not fit the keyboard. It is too small and doesn't quite fit the buttons around the edge of the keyboard. If it were the right size I would give it 5 stars."
1,not worth it,"I used this product on a bathtub. First of all, it was difficult to install because it is very sticky. Secondly, it wore off after a month of usage and started to allow water behind the tub after bubbling up in some spots and easily peeled off. I would not use this if you paid me."
1,Waste of money,"Bought this item, followed directions to the letter and it popped off after first shower, terrible product. The worst part about it was having to remove the glue mess that it left behind after removal."
2,Perfume Warning!,May state that it's hypoallergenic but it still contains a perfume that caused rashes on our infant. Confirmed with pediatrician that it was a skin rash and not baby acme. We switched to Cetaphil RestoraDerm body wash and the rashes quickly went away. Would not recommend for any sensitive skin infant.
5,Great for baby,"I love this soap. Our 9 month old has been using it since he was born and it gets him clean and soft and smells wonderful. Not at all powdery (I know some people really dig that smell for their babies but not me). And, it lasts forever! I've been using the same big bottle and it is more than half full. It makes small bubbles which he likes to play with as well."
4,Dread is the band!,"This was the last album recorded by the original lineup of Dread Zeppelin. The only founding members who remained in the group after this were Tortelvis and Butt-Boy. Anyway, as a last hurrah, this album is a pretty good one. There are a lot of good songs here, especially on the first half of the album. There are strong cover versions of ""Ramble On"", ""Viva Las Vegas"" and ""What is and What Should Never Be"". There is also an amusing, if dated, original song called ""Li'l Baby Elvis Jackson"", about a hypothetical baby born to Lisa Marie Presley and Michael Jackson. The best song on the second half of the album is probably ""Brick House (of the holy!)"", which is a medley of ""Brick House"" by the Commodores and ""Houses of the Holy"" by Led Zeppelin. This album is a fitting ""swan song"" for Dread Zeppelin, and the group's fans should enjoy it."
4,Trilateralism - A Biased But Worthwhile Read,"As a subscriber to the view that capitalists, for the most part, are heroes and that capitalism, for the most part, is the best of breed, I could have done without the editor's spin. This aside, trilateralism should be of interest to everyone who has an interest in globalism and the global economy; it contains a great deal of information not readily elsewhere. The unheralded contributions of the trilateralists will become evident upon a reading of this book; disregard the spin. I did."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"This is my 6th HP printer. I thought having all in one would be a great spacesaver for me. I had the printer exactly 3 weeks when I was using it one morning for a project. First the screen went fuzzy then gray but it was still printing. Then I thought I turn everything off for awhile and come back later. I could not turn it on. I checked the outlet to which it was plugged into but that was ok. I called HP support, they kept me on the phone for 2 hours and concluded that it must be a faulty power pack and are sending me a new one. This should take 5-10 business days. Since this product is still under warranty, (less than 1 month old) I wanted an even exchange. Guess what they said? So now I'm stuck without an operational printer. I will never deal with HP again."
1,Best printer I ever owned and 366 days later it died,"PROS: Networkedbeautifully (even with our macs), GREAT clear prints,loved the all in one functionality.CON: 366 days after I purchased this printer the scanning mechanism broke and scanning and copying features ceased. The folks at HP offered me 15% coupon towards the purchase of a new printer, but little else in the line of help. The scanner was used less than 50 times over the life of the product. I have heard from a number of people in stores that these printers are notorious for this problem. Bottom line, if you have the funds to replace annually this is a great printer, otherwise I would recommend looking elsewhere."
1,Power issues.,"I am on my second one, not sure what happens, but I have tested the power coming thru the cord and all is well to the unit. After about six months on both units the display went out and nothing seems to have power anymore. I called HP on the first one and did the swap for 150 dollars, was pleased with that. However, since the same thing happened, now I am looking for a different brand. Thinking Epson this go around"
3,Too much software!,"It makes a great printer, photo printer, fax, and scanner. But the software you must use is garbage. Even a ""minimal"" install takes 45 minutes and installs countless programs on your PC. I now have HP Director, HP Image Zone, HP This, HP That--- all kinds of crap I don't want. For a minimal install, I just want the printer driver and maybe the scanner driver. Now HP has taken over my laptop. I have system tray icons, program groups, desktop shortcuts, UGH!! I just wanted a printer! HP really needs to rethink their software strategy. This is obscene. Guess what HP: the fact that I bought a new printer doesn't mean that I print all day and night, and certainly doesn't mean that I want your dumb brand stuck all over my computer. I just want to print once in a while. My computer is not dedicated to printing, at least it wasn't until now. Sigh."
3,Ever wonder why?,"Ok for the most part the CD is decent, but not great. The one song that really stood out and was the reason why i decided to try them was Real Wild Child. They slaughter this song. They don't have the voices nor the hard rhythms that song had in either Dundee 2 or Iggy Pop's version. Granted Iggy's not the original, but he did a hell of a lot better on the song. As for the band and rest of the songs, they are catchy, but I really don't see them lasting more than a few years."
4,Excellent Story,"The author profiles the life of Mary Fields, a freed slave who,as the first African American woman letter carrier, delivered theU.S. mail via stagecoach between Cascade, Montana, and St. Peter's Mission in the late 1800s. Although Miller cites no sources and relates this tale in a style more suited to folklore than to biography, he does present a picture of a strong, independent woman who never allowed others to take advantage of her. Hanna's lively colored pencil drawings bring the cigar-chomping, gun-slinging heroine to life and include many details of the Montana frontier. A useful addition to units on African Americans and U.S. history, or, pair it with Geis' The First Ride , another perspective on pioneer mail delivery. Kay Weisman --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."
4,"Love the end result, but took my husband 3 hours to assemble","My 2 year old daughter LOVES this kitchen set! I was actually shocked how much she plays with this. And we like it too because it's cute, well-made and wooden! But it took my husband 3 dedicated hours and some sweat and tears to assemble. (But my husband says it was well worth it)"
4,Great value,"I got this when my daughter was two. She uses it almost daily. Very very durable and well made. Only takes about an hour to put together. Good value for the price. This kitchen is awesome for storage. We keep books, puzzles, kitchen stuff and other toys in it. It is a great piece that can be used as furniture."
2,Doesn't hold up,"I concur with other reviews about the long and complex assembly. My husband, an architect who is extremely handy took almost 3 hours to assemble this kitchen and had to deal with a couple of manufacturing defects along the way. After a year of use though, the kitchen is falling apart due to cheap and flimsy door hardware. None of the doors hang straight or stay closed anymore, and my 2 daughters are not rough players. Now looking to replace with something sturdier."
2,NO GANGSTARR SPIRIT IN THIS!!!!!!!,"When I get a DJ Premier project, with or without Guru I expect nothing less than pure excellence. I was very disappointed to find that his classic scratches were invisible and on some tracks he sounded mediocre! The beats used on most of this project sound like recycled lost mixtapes and we have nothing classic goin' on with any of them. You can skip this and nothing will haunt u later. 3 out of 10 for me."
5,ill shi*,This is straight up real hip hop no wack shi* if you like East coast underground it is a must get don't waste your money on other bullshi* and go hit this cd up
5,Talk the talk and Walk the walk,My CB radio is definetly puttin' out !! Elimenated all of the background noise with no breaks when transmitting. Keep on Truckin'
2,A fun little guitar but not worth learning off.,"I've been playing guitar for 4 years and this might be a fun guitar but if you want real quality,... I played around with this guitar and I don't just play the dumb songs in the book. I play Metallica, Weezer, Hendrix, Zeppelin and I don't think this guitar would live up to playing live, etc. (which I do).P.S. I own a Gibson American LP and an American Strat, so this might be fun for others but it didn't live up to my standards and song-writing."
2,Didn't last long because the amp blew.,My son loved making lots of noise on this guitar but the amp no longer works after only a few months and now he can't use it all. I would not recommend this product.
1,Expensive mistake,I actually went to a mall and a shop assistant at a retail store recommended this product so I paid $95 hard earned dollars on it thinking it's expensive but it it works its ok.As others have remarked it did not do a damn thing to my dark eye circles so my personal hunt for a great product that actually works goes on.Also I am wondering why most dark eye treats cost over $50?
3,Surprised by the other criticisms,"I have used this product for over a year. I have genetically inherited puffy dark circles under my eyes and I have found hylexin to certainly reduce the puffiness, and, it seems to have removed some of the darkness, too.I went to a dermatologist for skin bleaching of this area for a couple years, which helped, but it was very expensive, so $95 doesn't seem like a lot to me to maintain lighter pigmentation and tighter skin under my eyes. Plus, the skin bleach from dermatologists is very strong and did cause some eye irritation.What no one is bothering to tell any of you people is what the dermatologists tell all people who want to reduce dark circles and lighten the skin under their eyes: YOU HAVE TO ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS wear sunscreen on top of whatever product you are using to lighten the skin."
1,Scam product,this is another scam and bogus product from the Basic Research company who is always being sued
5,Giong Deeper into the Pain through WInter to Spring,"This book is a psalter for anyone who has ever experienced chronic pain and a metaphor for transformation for those who have not. Lopez, desperate for relief from pain following surgery that would not heal, sought the advice of a body-centered healer, who told her the only way he knew to relieve pain was by going deeper into it. Reading, browsing and rereading Lopez' book takes us to the place where boundaries merge and the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies are one. Thus, it reminds us that WE are ONE and describes for us in poetry and metaphor, the mystical and ecstatic experience of atonement (at-one-ment) and healing. The book is beautifully written and elegantly illustrated. Like pain itself, it can become a companion to trust and walk with upon occasion for there is much to learn in these liminal lands."
4,Muy bueno,Una de las cosas que siempre me han gustado de Saul es que cada disco busca cosas diferentes lo que los hace interesantes.Creo que para apreciar el disco lo tienes que oir un par de veces. Si lo escuchas la primera vez seguramente la impresion no será favorable. Sin embargo lo mismo me ocurrio cuando oi por primera vez el disco del Diablito(me dije ¿que demonios es esto?). A pesar de que no lo considero el mejor de los discos es bueno. Le doy cuatro estrellas. El disco en vivo es excelente y si tienen oportunidad veanlos en vivo.
3,what happened?,"i liked equilibrio better. lyrically, the cd is poetry. i did expect harder and darker guitar riffs. except for ""tu reino"", the rest of the songs dont get me going. cd 1 is live performances and good ones. cd 2 is slower. still good but not rock music."
4,Still holds up,"I first bought this album in 1966 when it was released on ""vinyl"". Lost it in the divorce so was glad to find it on CD. Still a great listen."
4,Highly Recommended For Those Investigating LDS Church,"A must read for those first investigating the Mormon church. The authors give clear examples of the differences in terminology, beliefs and reasoning of the two religions. Historical fact is stressed rather than an emotional response, though it does have a Christian bent. Easy to read and understand. Clearly explains how the LDS church worships man rather than the traditional God of Judeo/Christian history."
3,Great bible knowledge riddled with conspiracy theories,"Pros:I respect Robert King greatly regarding his bible knowledge and insight of the scriptures. I don't fault King or anyone else's position regarding the Society's issue with prophetic interpretation or their self appointment of being the Faithful & Discreet slave. I actually enjoyed his interpretation of prophecies found in scripture and I think all former witnesses should inspect these alternate suppositions.Cons:In my honest opinion, instead of up-building peoples faith in what he still believes is sound doctrine and God's chosen people, the book places the Witnesses' mind and faith into constant limbo. Should I stay or should I go?"
1,Not so informative,This book didn't have nearly enough information. I still have tons of questions about my goldfish. It is especially lacking in information on goldfish illness.
2,Extremely Average,"This is my first Woods book, and as a fan of this genre I was very disappointed. The love story between Cary and Stone in this novel is one of the most unrealistic, ridiculous ones I have ever read. Right before the rather dull and predictable climax, Stone dreams of marrying this woman and having kids with her. WHY???? Other than her apparent physical attributes and sexual prowess she offers nothing of substance. By the end of the novel, even before the incredibly predictable revelation of who pushed Sasha, she was an immensely unlikable person. Yet we are to believe that our handsome, intelligent protagonist is in love with this woman. COME ON!!!The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because there were one or two plot twists early on that I found interesting. Even though I have a couple of Woods paperbacks on my shelf, I am not sure I will read him again. If so, I hope the next one is better than this mess."
5,Never read the first book and it was great,Need I say more. Finally read the first book with Stone and Dino and what a terrific start to the long line of great reads.
1,"Hockey Card ""Center Ice"" Package",The description said 25 packs of cards from 1990 to the present. The 25 packs delivered had nothing from 1996-the present. 90% were from 1990.I also received 2 packs of stickers not cards.Very misleading and definely not worth the money.Go to a card store and buy 25 packs of these old cards at $.75 each and save the cost of shipping and handling
3,I don't know if I would.,"This is a OK light, it has some pros: super bright, looks pro, good hanging bracket. But the cons are: it breaks no matter what! I have ordered TWO of these and they both break with the same issue. I don't even want to take the time to type out why and what broke. If your getting this for sound active, DON'T!!! The manual and 1/4 link is fine. But sound active freaks out and ends up breaking your light."
2,Truly a beginning,"As is noted in several reviews, this is a beginning. It is devoted to basic principles and 'relaxation'. It is not instruction in a sequence. Buyer beware."
1,I Learned Absolutely Nothing From This Book,"I expected this book to cover security audits.This book is a step by step guide to using a handfull of auditing tools (including installation).If you have never seen an auditing tool like Nessus or hping then this book may teach you something. However, after reading this book alone, you will by no means have the knowledge required to conduct a security audit. You are only shown how a few tools work. Not what to do with the information provided, not what it means, nothing."
3,Warning about short rebate period,"I've ordered OCZ memory many times. It's decent, about the same as any other decent brand. The big problem with OCZ though is they are constantly running rebates which is one of the big factors in buying OCZ. The rebate period maybe the shortest time from any brand, 12 days. The usual time Ive seen generally is one to two months! By the time you get the sticks you have a very short time left. In fact if there are any delays in shipping or getting the items, you often miss the postmark deadline.This is especially true if you pick any of the Amazons cheaper and slower delivery options. Choosing Free Shipping, theres a big chance you wont even get the item in time before the deadline passes. So factor that in when ordering OCZ items with rebates."
1,YAWN--read this if you like lots of simpleminded sex scenes,"There was so little plot in this book that I almost stopped reading it. This was my first Jaid Black book, and probably my last. Don't expect the quality you'd see in something by Robin Schone. If you count quality by the number of sex scenes, this may be your type of book; if you want well written erotica, try something else."
3,Wish it could be more comfortable,It definately holds my finger in the position it should be in but the edges are sharp and cut into my finger making it very sore so I can't wear it every day as I should.
2,"Please, Give me A Break!","This collection is missing the better remixes. They should have dumped the more recent remixes for tracks off the Promotional INXS Dekadance cassette/vinyl only (I have it on CD though too, Shhhh) from australia with tracks like ""Melting In the Sun"" & ""Original Sin"" & others or the US version on vinyl only (Also have a CD version of it) which has ""The One thing"" extended. The bottom line is put out a solid remix collection or forget it because INXS early remixes were far superior recordings. I professionally collect INXS & take it from me. For the hardcore INXS fan there is nothing really here. The average fan might like to hear it for the differences. You be the judge. Later"
4,One of the first Glam Rock bands,"Virtually unknown in the US, Chicory tip preceeded Kiss by a few years. Their best known work being ""Son Of My Father"" charted mostly in the UK and the Continent. I would have given this CD 5 stars except for the exclusion of ""The Devil Rides Tonight"" (a rare gem) which never charted anywhere and which I obtained as a RAdio Promo 45 back in 1971."
3,Disappointed about Closed-Captioning,"I purchased this DVD hoping to gain more knowledge about Autism and Asperger's, but I was disappointed that it was not closed-captioned. A person would think that if the DVD was about someone that has a disability, it would be available for ALL persons with disabilities."
4,An enjoyable read.,"I also read 'Mrs Kimble',which I think has the edge over this book, by same author. The reader is educated about the happenings of a mining town, where at least once a year a miner is killed in an explosion or injured in a rockfall. (12). I loved the descriptions and nuances used by this author.The empty lives of women is depicted repeatedly in this book. It was hard for males too but at least they could get away. Women had no such outlet other than to get attached to men who were often ""drunken louts who communicated mainly by cursing..."" (117) Bigotry between different ethnic groups is palpable. Diabetes and its associated hazzards are dealt with through the character of Rose. Well done!"
1,Give me back the life I wasted reading this!,"How can a book that garnered such good reviews prove to be such a disappointment? I picked up the book expecting more candy than steak but if I am going to knowingly indulge in empty calories, I'd at least like to enjoy the experience. This book doesn't even rise to the level of beach-reading.It's not just that it was boring, but it was also historically sloppy (Magic Markers, the Watergate in the 40's...puh-leeze) and intellectually dishonest. No character development, no motivation, no reasons to care about any of the characters because all their lives were dismal. At least the ones we were told about...what was with Sandy?The only good thing I can say about it is that because so much of what should have been included to make this a good book wasn't there, it was a very quick read."
2,"lazy, sloppy soap opera","not a truly bad book, but truly not a good one either. the bite-sized sections prevent any real momentum or depth, and the inaccuracies are glaring and everywhere. on the very first page, the train that goes from altoona to pittsburgh crosses the susquehanna. that would be scenic, but since the susquehanna is entirely on the other side of the allegheny mountains, forty miles to the east, it's impossible. in a pointillist work like this, the writing needs to be precise, but so does the thinking and editing. the sloppiness kills the book."
2,long winded,The book is boring because it moves so slowly and gives to much detail. I think it would be good if it was more to the point.
2,I didn't like this one..,"I had to dig through a bunch a rhetoric to find the techniques that were promised...and the techniques weren't all that new or interesting.She talks much about what a man likes a woman to be like(bla bla bla). I don't like the fact that she encourages women to tip-toe around men's ""triggers"" or emotional turn-offs. I was hoping to be an empowered and more daring lover after i read it, but I turned out just feeling bla."
1,"Boring, never got moving very well. Snooze fest",We kept waiting for something to make us a little bit interested in any on the characters. Never happened and we have no desire to look at future episodes to see if they get more interesting.Big waste of our time and money
5,Mad Men Meets Newsroom!,Catch up on this intriguing mix of complex characters against a background of historical fact and back-room journalism and politics. It's fascinating and addictive.
5,broadcast news meets John LeCarre,"This series attains the generally high level of most BBC drama. The acting is superb, the recreation of the period spot on,the unfolding of the plot keeps you watching for the next twist. Underneath the characters all seem to have their resonancein ones from the movie Broadcast News. The responsible cynical guy is Freddy, the bloodless network execs, the freneticcareerist Belle who falls for the slick anchor man Madden and subsidiary characters who all rush around as if the worldwas entirely focused on them. But through it all, the quality shows through and The Hour overcomes the temptation of beachinga pale Broadcast News clone and becomes something far more original and meaty. Great viewing."
5,The best oil free dressing on the market,"I HAVE TRIED MANY,MANY FAT FREE DRESSINGS OVER MANY YEARS OF DIETING. NONE OF THEM TASTED GOOD. I NEVER BOUGHT A SECOND BOTTLE OF ANY OF THEM.. THEN ,I TRIED ""GOOD SEASONS"" FAT FREE ITALIAN SALAD DRESSING.IT IS SO GOOD AND VERSATILE.I USE VARIOUS FLAVORED VINEGARS WHEN BLENDING IT SO I DON'T GET BORED WITH ONE FLAVOR. MY FAVORITE IS WHITE BALSAMIC, BUT RED WINE AND REGULAR BALSAMIC ARE VERY GOOD ,AS WELL.I TURNED TO AMAZON BECAUSE MOST GROCERY STORES DO NOT CARRY IT, AND SINCE MOVING,I HAVEN'T FOUND IT AT ALL IN MY AREA GROCERY STORES.THROUGH AMAZON,I WAS ABLE TO GET A CASE OF 24 FOR MUCH LESS MONEY THAN WHAT I PAID IN THE STORE,WHEN I COULD FIND IT.THANK YOU GOOD SEASONS AND AMAZON."
1,Good Deal,"The price was good for this item. However, after opening the box of 24, 4 of the envelopes were sealed but empty of contents. So now the price wasen't so good. Guess I'll not be buying large quanties again."
4,And yes the A is for awesome.,"Great show, but Amazon mixed up the first and second episodes. C'mon, how could the pilot be the second episode?"
2,Damaged Case,The DVD's seem to play fine and the arrival date was correct but the DVD case itself is heavily damaged to the point where it can't hold the DVD's in place.
2,For Frisky Dingo fans...maybe,"Ratings are a guesstimate, usually on the ""safe side"".Genre: Comedy, spy-dramaSituations: Probably RLanguage: RNudity: PG+Violence: RSpecial Features: Disc 1: Unaired Pilot episode (a parody actually, with the main character being replaced in ep. 1 by a velociraptor), Pilot episode for the live action series ""the League"".Disc 2: Unaired Network Promo (commercial ad), The Making of Archer (subsections for different aspects of production), Deleted Scenes (always one of my preferred extras), and a pilot episode of the live action series ""Louie""This is very reminiscent of Cartoon Network's Frisky Dingo, Stroker and Hoop, or Assy McGee. The animation is very like Frisky Dingo and the writing more a mix. Whatever drew my attention to this series, I now wish I hadn't bothered. While moderately amusing in a sophomoric way, it wasn't something I'd have bought if I had known more about it first."
4,Just Fun,If you like adult cartoons of a variety of intellectual to sexual comedy this is for you. I prefer Season 2 as more seems to happen but Season 1 sets the character building that makes this series as good as it is.
5,Hilarious!,"My wife and I love this show! It's too bad they only produce ~12 episodes per year. I realize that the humor may be too crude for some people (the older you are, the less you'll like the show), but it's really clever and funny. It aims to offend just about everyone, so don't you dare wine about how offensive it is."
5,Good product,These clips are easy to use and work much better than the ones that have a metal clasp which are hard to secure.
4,Great for the $$$,Berkeley is on top of the game with this line the $$$ factor plus a very good line can not go wrong
2,Not worth it.,Not very pliable. Twists & tangles easily. Would never use heavy monofilament again. A better option is braided line for 30# weight or higher.
4,Berkley Trilene is the best,This is one of if not the best monofiliment line that is affordable to the average recreational fisherman and amazon sells it at a great price.
3,A very good attempt to intewave IT startegy to Business,"In my 23 years of experience of working in IT, I would say that this is the first book on IT strategy that attempts to make IT a PART of startegic intent of the business.No doubt, the book is hard to read and comprehend, but the effort is worth it.I would have given it an higher rating but for the fact that practical examples is missing which would have made the book more complete."
1,Terrible dvd,"This dvd lasted only 25 minutes, horrible. There are many dvds which have many many minutes of run time costing the same 24 dollars. I consider it to be the worst dvd I have ever purchased. It does have valuable information but it lacks safety measures, putting together a spearline etc.... Very empty dvd. Definitely not worth the 24 dollars. Period."
5,fast shipping,"very lively, very well put together. the cd is very heavey into the celtic roots, making it all the better"
5,Great book for wireless security fundamentals,"Excellent book to get an overview of the types of wireless technologies and security issues. It provides the reader with a solid foundation in computing technology, wireless tehcnology and security methodologies, and wraps it up with a review of processes and products to implement. I particulary like the appendicies, which detail various cracking techniques."
3,crank for the auger broke in two weeks,"My two year old grandson saw this Bruder Man Garbage rear loading truck at a friend's home, and could not/would not leave it. The toy is attractive, and has great detail. For the amount of money, I would expect however that the product testing would have vetted the crank for trash auger - a piece of plastic with not much reinforcement, when turned the wrong direction (really?) just sheared off. The auger can be still be turned but the broken shaft is rough on fingers. He still loves the truck - what does a grandmother do - I couldn't return it - he sleeps with it beside his bed."
1,Fair,It's not as sturdy as I had assumed. The back attachment to put the bins on is flimsy. I'm disappointed and will not spend that much again.
1,FOR AROMATHERAPY ONLY,"I purchased this tea tree oil from Amazon, and in tiny print on the bottle, it says for aromatherapy only, and if you want to use it on your skin, you need to dilute it with almond oil. Thanks a lot, I just bought 2 bottles for use on my toenail. The Mason Natural 2 oz tea tree oil says that it is pharmaceutical grade, and it was a superior product. We live and learn."
2,I love the smell,"I honestly haven't found any use for this. I tried using it for acne, but it makes my face REALLY dry not matter how much (or little) I use. Even after my moisturizer. I tried using it to repel fleas, no such luck.The best thing I've found about this is the smell. I love it. It is very strong smelling, though. Fortunately, I only bought the 1 oz bottle. But If I find an actual use for it, I'll post it. But as for now, I would not buy again."
2,"This product was very hard to mix, especially ...","This product was very hard to mix, especially without a shaker. Cold water caused serious product lumping and it was hard to dissolve. When mixed with water as per instructions, the taste was very bland, with little chocolate flavor even though the packaging advertises """"New Great Taste"""" and """"creamy soda fountain shakes"""". Not quite. Needs improvement in that area. Right now, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,A different tale,This book is a little different from the earlier books in the series. We know who the murderer is early in the tale and the interest lies in the way Dame Frevisse solves the crime. Another interesting and historically accurate read from Margaret Frazer.
5,Awesome!!,"Wether it's birght yellow gun or any other song on this album, you will hear an artist and a band that is truely unique and inspiring. The more I've listened to this CD over the years, the more I absolutely loved it! BUY THIS and you will not be sorry!"
3,Alberto Cortez Sinfonico CD-DVD,"El audio no está bien, pierde todo su valor cuando se escucha la voz del artista lejos y la música lo ahoga."
1,Much less than expected,It was very disappointing. It looked like a plain box of pencils not anything special and certainly not a worthy gift.
2,Check your options,"We tried both these and theseAdhesive Stainless V Towel Grabber set of 2 (Stainless Steel) (1""H x 3""W x 3""D)I'm giving two stars, because you get what you see and it's initially a great product. However...the 'Push towel grabber' came apart after 3 months. The plastic blue center fell out on both of them (I have it under my bathroom sink and use it occasionally). I have the 'V towel grabber' by the bathtub and put a wet wash cloth in it every night. The cloth is dry in the morning and the holder is in great shape. I do not recommend this 'Push towel grabber'.The 'V towel grabber' is cheaper also. If you must choose the push type, the red ones will save you four dollars."
5,Great item!,"This belt is almost identical to the one I received during deployment issue at Fort Drum. It is a few inches shorter and has an elastic strip in which to hold the excess close to the waist. These are sturdy belts, probably the same material used in ratchet straps. My original is 5 years old and other than being stained from deployments shows no signs of breaking or fraying of any kind. Great work belt. There are no notches; it is a slide buckle. The length is 44"" so should fit a waist of around 40"" with some excess.This belt was out-of-stock when my order was filled. The company found a belt and shipped my entire order to me promptly, instead of the additional 9 days it might have taken for them to get another belt. Great service."
1,"Power Bars Arrive Past ""Best By"" Date","Be careful--my order of 12 Power Bars arrived today, March 15,2012, with a ""Best By 10 Mar 12"" on the box.Update: By just advising Amazon, they did an immediate correction offering to refund my purchase. Great customer service by Amazon for another Seller's issue."
2,Do Not Taste That Great,"Good try, but these taste too much like over-sweet chemical mush bars that leave an semi-acrid aftertaste. The Chocolates are the best, hands down. This one tastes like sweetener that resembles oatmeal was added. Very fake. They are edible, but they are overpoweringly chemical."
4,"Great service, a bit pricey","Best PowerBar made. For bulk purchases, the price and shipping felt high ($1.75 per bar).Very timely delivery, though."
4,them are yummy!!!!,The box came already opened but all 12 bars are individually wrapped and they were all there. They tasted fresh. Does not melt like many of the other energy bars. All of them are yummy!!!!
3,FRUSTRATING!!!,"I just bought this bridge for my 3 year-old boy. The frustrating part is that the bridge has two female ends, meaning you cannot make a full circle. At first I thought it was defective, so I called Learning Curve. The customer care person confirmed that it is made with two female ends and I need to buy an adapter. The toy was expensive without having to buy a $10 adapter. Why would Learning Curve do this? My son kept crying because he was so excited to make a track and he couldn't. Such a shame . ."
2,Looks better than it works,"The 2 female connectors make using this bridge frustrating. Before I could buy an additional connector, the bridge broke. We can no longer reconnect the bridge after collapsing it."
4,Great addition to railway!,"My 3 year-old son is a Thomas ""addict,"" and this bridge was something he's been wanting for a long time. I was a bit concerned by some of the reviews stating that the bridge collapses too easily, but I was pleasantly surprised when we received it. I don't know if it's been re-engineered after the negative reviews, but ours holds up quite strongly. Note also that my boy LOVES to crash his trains and the tracks (ie, he's not ""careful"" with the bridge). The only downside is that it takes a decent amount of force to properly secure the bridge in the locked ""up"" position, so my son hasn't learned to do it on his own yet. Nonetheless, it's a great and interesting addition to our layout!"
4,No insurmountable issues,"Our bridge came with a supplemental instruction sheet on how to ensure that the bridge is properly rebuilt after each collapse. If anything, it's a bit tricky to collapse it since often it is not enough to just press one of the two side buttons. Our daughter loads up the bridge and it has never collapsed on its own. As for creating a loop, you might consider buying a pack of SureTrack which allows for the joining of two female ends. It's not something that a toddler can easily do on their own but it's a fairly cost-effective option. Note that carpet will make it difficult for trains to pass under this and similar riser structures because of the minimal clearance and how the structures tend to sink further into the carpet than plain track."
3,good ideas but not well written,"While Dr Ellis has some good ideas, I don't believe he presents these ideas as well as he could. I found much of what he wrote was long winded."
4,Entertaining,"I had not seen this show before watching the DVD's and we don't have cable. Fun entertainment and enjoyed watching, but have to say I enjoy Ghost Adventures much more. Might still be willing to watch more season of Ghost Hunters, but would only buy if on sale. My children liked watching. Some of the show seemed a bit to rehearsed when they talk after the hunt, but other then that it was fun."
3,Best so far,"Season 3, Part 1 is the best of the Ghost Hunters series so far. Thankfully, all the internal politics that was featured in earlier series has been sorted [or at least no longer seen as good TV], the meaningless roto-rooter sponsor messages have been minimised and the production quality has been improved. But most importantly, the quality of the locations has improved dramatically. Trips to 'The Shining' hotel and the UK are much more interesting than visiting some spook from the mid west who has been on the moonshine for way too long.Good stuff."
2,Over-rated and badly written,"I bought Slayer based on the other reviews written here and was horribly disappointed. I can't believe this book made it past an editor. It was so poorly written that I had trouble finishing the book! And believe me, it wasn't worth finishing.Slayer is, at best, a derivative parody of gothic, vampire fiction. It fails as a vampire novel because the characters are shoddily recycled from Anne Rice, Michael Moorcock, and the shows/movies mentioned in the other reviews. The pompous and overwrought writing is painful to read. Please don't buy this thinking that it is some kind of urban gothic manifesto. It isn't.Was this someone's idea of a joke?? If so, I'd like a refund. I would never have bought this book at a brick & mortar store because I was ready to put it back on the shelf after the first couple of pages."
5,A great tool for approaching the topic with an aging parent,This is one of the best books I've seen in a long time. It's a very practical book that's written so anyone can understand it. It's a great way to introduce the subject of planning for the future with a parent (or an adult child).
4,hillarious,"I really enjoyed this film. It has a very dark, sarcastic dry humor about it- More along the lines of the Royal Tennebaums. I found it even more so funny because none of the situations or character problems seemed plausible. Great comedy."
3,hopelssness as comedy?,Liv Tyler is the real highlight of this film ( the reason I didn't give it two stars). The script is as hopeless as most of the acting.I wouldn't show it to prison inmates without taking their belts and shoe laces from them. The star is just a pretty nice guy who seems to have very little going for him in brains or guts.
5,soooo good! Hard to find..,"This salad dressing mix from Good Seasons is excellent! It is very hard to find in my local grocery stores. I use it as a marinade for chicken, and as a salad dressing. It is super on pasta salads!"
1,zero results,"I started the 3 month detox and thought I was doing it wrong.. it comes with out any instructions.. I had ZERO results. I thought at least the ""cleasning portion"" would provide a cleansing. The person on NCL who sold it to me said I would have a deep cleasning of toxins and not to be surprised at how much I ""detoxed"" and also how much weight I would lose and how great I would feel. I have looked up every single ingredients on the internet and while they are all strong herbal ingredients used, the amount they use must be too low to make any difference. The more I found blogs and other sites like this .. the more I wish I would never have tried them...... Metamucil works better for a cleanse (same key ingredient) and the amount of nutrients they list are also found in a good multi vitamin. 3 months-- 300 dollars.. nothing !"
3,"It says here, ""Tortelvis will talk about Critmas album"". Critmas album? That must be Southern for ""Christmas"".","This is a Christmas EP by Dread Zeppelin, the band that played Led Zeppelin songs reggae style, with an Elvis impersonator singing. There is only one actual Christmas song on the thing, a hilarious version of ""All I Want For Christmas is My Two Front Teeth"". There are two other non-Christmas songs. ""The Last Resort"" is the theme song from the National Lampoon movie of the same title. And there is a 13 minute remix of ""Kashmir"", a song from Dred's fourth album. The rest of the CD features the group just goofing around, telling jokes and talking about Christmas related things. Pretty amusing if you're already a fan of the band, probably not so much if you are not."
3,Offers a chuckle in the classic Altman style,"I thoroughly enjoy Robert Altman's style of film, where he throws between 10 and 20 rather odd characters together and then watches them interact. This film is not great, but there are some truly classic lines and situations! An interesting cast, and definitely offers a humorous / black comedy slant on attending a wedding. Carol Burnett is a hoot!"
2,face is a little scary,"Our civic association purchased this for our annual Easter fest. We were looking more at price than overall effect, and now I am searching for a replacement. The most common comment from the kids is the face is a little scary. Looking for a cuter more cuddly effect. This one also does not cover the back of the neck and the red cords that tie the costume at the back are conspicuous. I would not recommend this one. Spend a little more and get something that will make you very happy year after year."
1,Do not buy this book!,"Do not buy this book! The only section you can use without audio cds is reading, and you know what it does not even have answers for reading sections.If you want to pay all your money just to buy the cd which comes with book then buy it :) it is waste of money.p.s : i bought this book in my country and had to paid $110 for it."
3,"Great to hear once, but nothing here compels a replay...","I love Kris, Willie, Johnny and Waylon, and I liked several of their collaborations when they were fresh recordings. Hearing this collection was pleasant enough, but somehow the sum of the parts is not the equal of the works of the individual members. There are certain performances by each of these men that I NEVER get tired of hearing, but put these superstars together and the result itself seems a bit tired. Their work as a group was a gimmick, and it shows. As with ""The Traveling Willburys"" it is the original studio recordings of the members alone that will live on, not their couple of attempts to sell themselves as a supergroup."
1,ALL REGION not Region 1,a brand new release for 2007 and its NOT region 1?!Yet MORE RETARDED DECISIONS BY THE MUSIC INDUSTRY!
2,lousy,"i just got this cd, did not enjoy it. the band is sloppy doom / hard rock with no real melody or groove. there are bits of good on here but save your money for something else. the only decent song in my opinion is track 1."
5,These I will make!,"I bought this book, and when I got it I have to admit that I was suprised at the small size and number of recipes(about 50). I was glad that I had bought the book at a discount because I do not think that I would have paid full price for the book. Then I went through the book and I was extremely pleased at the attention to detail and the ways she came up with to make traditional favorites even better. This is not a cookie encyclopedia with a million recipes for mediocre lumps of baked dough, but a selection of favorites that are absolutely delicious. I can imagine making EVERY recipe in this book, and that I cannot say about any cookbook I own but this one. The book itself has pictures of almost every cookie and it is printed on high quality paper, so this book will not fall apart in a few years."
1,Just propaganda!!,Just Pro-Goverment propaganda.Very bad written. Don't spend your money un this book.
5,Margaritaville Concoction Maker Bag,I really like this bag because I can take my Margaritaville machine with me when I go to parties. It looks nice so and I am very happy with my purchase.
1,Does not fit the Larger Margarita Maker,"If you have the larger Margaritaville Margarita Maker (it's red), let it be known that this carrier bag is NOT large enough to accomodate your machine. if anyone has any suggestions for me to store my ""monster"" please let me know."
5,Easy read and full of information,"Vera Alder does an amazing job taking rather complex esoteric subject matter and making it easy to understand for the those new to these studies. It's clear she has a deep and accurate understanding of the subject matter and covers much in this book.Thanks Vera, wherever you are!"
3,Games You Can Play with Your Pussy Cat,"Hilarious and well written book! This reprint shrinks from the original quarto size (probably more economical to publish) and changes the original cover title by adding the word ""Cat"". The original cover is used as the frontispiece, so I see no reason for the change. Not a big problem, except that the political correctness diminishes the original joke of the whole book. If you are expecting the original version of ""Games You Can Play with Your Pussy"", this ain't it. But the price is right, and the content is intact."
5,Beautiful album,"Wow, no reviews... if you're here you know this is Chris Knox of the New Zealand band ""Tall Dwarfs"". Wonderful wonderful album and ""Not Given Lightly"" was voted New Zealand's thirteenth best song of all time. Don't bother with the snippet here, it doesn't do it justice, listen to the full track on youtube, etc. to hear its beauty. You'll listen to it over and over, feature it on mixed tapes for friends and lovers (people still make mix tapes right?), and hum it while shopping for groceries. This is a required purchase for fans of Flying Nun Records and the Tall Dwarfs."
4,I like it,"I've used this product twice and I like it---once you get passed the smell. My skin felt smoother after I rinsed it off. The next day, I did received compliments on my face. That's pretty good for my age !! LOL I personally think that the bottle should come in a darker color, since knowing that acids do better in less light !!!"
2,"It's just ok, no big deal...","I am a brown complexion african american female. I purchased this product with the intent that it would lighten the dark marks on my legs. I only used it in my face once and it burned like hell. Ultimately, I did a series of four treatments over four weeks. There is absolutely no difference in my dark marks except that they are a little lighter...just by maybe one shade. If I were to purchase another peel, I would definitely get a higher strength. This one doesn't peel at all. It was my first time, and now I know what to expect. Two stars because I was fooled by the reviews on this product, They are extremely overrated and I'm just here to be real and tell the TRUTH."
5,Great 1st time Chemical peel,"This peel has made such a difference in my skin. My skin was dull, uneven, and blotchy. Plus, I was breaking out terribly due to being pregnant. You would not believe the before and after pictures. After just four weeks, my skin is dewy, even, and fresh-looking. AND no more breakouts."
2,I dont see any improvement?,"I wanted to give this a month or so before I commented on what I thought, I got it around the 1st week of Nov and I have been using it once a week, I dont really see a difference at all in my face? I did have a zit on my lower cheek and I spot treated there, I dont know hopefully it looks okay but it didnt today...also around that area it looks like I fell and scabbed my face, I noticed that happened in another area last time, and the 1st time this patch by my eye got dry and started peeling then I got another patch by my nose, I dont know I dont really see an improvement yet?"
4,Good Application of Research,"Richard Bauman presents a collection of essays that employ the use of performance theory. He analyzes a range of topics, and my favorite essays deal with tall tales and narratives told by coon-hunters in Texas. The work is solid scholarship, and he provides empirical ways of researching and interpreting various forms of verbal expression. The collection may be most useful as models for additional studies, and there is a great variety of research topics evoked what Bauman discusses. At times, however, the conclusions are less-than earth-shattering, and the theoretical apparatus tends to get in the way of developing important conclusions and offering insight into why these conclusions are significant. Despite the limitations, this is a good volume of articles on folklore."
1,LMAO!!!!,"My friends and I like to watch really bad movies for the fun of it. This one was soooo bad that we (literally) turned it off at about the 20 minute mark and finished it 2 days later. This movie has it all: horrible dialogue, atrocious animation, stupid fart jokes, random/unrelated scenes, WORSE song ever, and (being targeted to kids) it's absolutely a movie to avoid showing your children. It has scary sequences, inappropriate scenes like eating coins, and downright idiotic jokes and pranks that even made me cringe. Watch this movie if you're looking for a laugh with a couple of friends but do not... DO NOT let your children watch this garbage."
1,Poor as Biography--And Info Here Free On-Line,"Sheppard sets the stage for this weak book by entirely misconstruing the value of the two major 1990s Cohen biographies. He says _Various Positions: A Life of Leonard Cohen_ is for ""besotted"" Cohenites, whereas _Leonard Cohen: Prophet of the Heart_ is for the more ""literary"" minded. Turn this observation around and it makes sense, but as it stands it's the comment of a moron. Ira Nadel's biography is kind to Cohen, to be sure, (he had Cohen's full cooperation, after all), but it is not the fawning piece of dreck that is _Prophet of the Heart_. Nadel, in fact, uses _Prophet of the Heart_ as a source, for factual details and for some of Cohen's comments in it, but Nadel manages not to incorporate the syrupy crud that the folks who wrote _Prophet_ poured onto every page. Sheppard needs to learn what excessive deference is before his writing will inspire."
1,Rumford Fireplaces and How They are Made,"I'd still like to read this book. Unfortunately, what I received was the correct book cover wrapped around another book that had the very weird title: ""A study of Forensic Alimony"". I keep wondering who the poor sucker was that let God knows how many books be shipped with such a huge error."
2,A well written but often slow moving story.,"""The Devil's Butcher Shop"" by Roger Morris seems less a description of the Santa Fe prison uprising than an indictment of New Mexico's prison system. While the author writes solid,factual accounts of inexcusable corruption within New Mexico's corrections department,he dwells on it so long the reader tends to forget there ever was a riot."
2,Informative; but misdirected.,"The author includes many interesting details of the riot, but seems to use most of the book to describe alleged corruption in New Mexico. He gives the feeling that the alleged corruption contributed to the start of the riot. He then takes the reader on long detours that have little or nothing to do with the riot itself. I was disappointed."
5,first and best,"I read this book about 15 years ago, I kept it in my drawer for years, then I let a friend read it and never got it back......I have never read a book with so much happiness and sadness in the same chapter. The love they felt and the anger they had was uncomparable... I fell in love with the both of them. Some nights I would read for 5 hours and others I would have to put it down after 1 hour do to the sadness I felt or the anger I felt.... It was one of the best books I have ever read... If anyone knows where I can find it in Canada please let me know..........forever searching"
3,Interesting if you can get past the horrible writing....,This guy is definitely a geek and NOT an English major. The stories are interesting and frightening if you can get past the constant run on sentences and poor grammar. Good luck.
1,mitnick,"I could not manage to get through the whole of this book, and in fact gave it away, because Mitnick is so pompous as to make a subject that is so thoroughly interesting so painful to get through. Seriously, he must have none of his over-inflated personality left because I think it all dripped out of my book."
5,Doubled Download Speed over Manufacturer Installed Winmodem,"I purchased the Zoom 2925 PCI modem to replace the ""Winmodem"" that had been originally installed by the computer manufacturer. I am quite satisfied. Connections to the web are consistently fast, generally 48000 bps or better, and download speeds average better than 5 KBps, which, I believe, is fairly quick. In addition, with this modem I was able to add Fax capability to the computer, something the OEM fax did not have. Bottom line - this modem is easy to install and it works. Zoom puts out a nice product."
5,Getting Help For Your Work,"A very useful book when you are ready for practical help. Reading books is a great way to get the ideas in your intellectual center but there is a point where reading needs the support of actual techniques that can assist one in their work. Very valuable to me, I highly recommend this book."
1,Gloves pictured are not what was shipped.,"I ordered these gloves for a Dr. Horrible Costume, so I needed this exact style of gloves. Instead they were shipped from Acehardwareoutlet and when they arrived they were a totally different style. I'm going to try and bleach them so they will work, but be warned if you order here that the pictured gloves are not what you will get."
1,replaced 3 defective units so far,"Our electrician explained that we need all the same model/type of unit, which is the only reason I'm still purchasing these (big house, lots of alarms). If you are looking to switch, don't switch to BRK. Easy to install but that's about it."
3,Data Cable and software,"Fun to play with. Some features are easy to use and download. However the tone player on the computer didn't work. Still for the money, a good cheap way to get many screensavers to download."
1,More mediocrity,"If you've been unfortunate enough to have waded through one of Ms. Koehler's earlier pseudogothic pot-boilers, you can spare yourself the time required to trudge through the predicatable and poorly-crafted ""horrors"" of SLAYER. There's nothing here that hasn't been done before and done better."
3,A fairly good read,"I was compelled to keep reading, although grew weary toward the end.The beginning seemed to offer promise of some real scares, but it devolved into bloodletting and stupidity. Also, the plot is too close to Shirley Jackson'sThe Haunting of Hill House -- which is far superior -- too many horror story writers think that over-the-top gore and explicitly bloody and ""perverted"" (please - lesbianism? Isn't this the 21st C.?) sex will carry the book, when I find that what scares me is exactly the opposite - subtlety, ambiguity, the feel of someone perhaps looking over your shoulder -- that's the scarey stuff of nightmares.Read Shirley Jackson and the Turn of the Screw instead."
3,Ending leaves me wanting...,"A really quick, spooky read. Not very eloquent or particularly alluring prose as far as a literal piece, but superb content. I read this in one night, and was completely sucked into the plot. And just when the book had me poised for an unprecedented denouement, it instead did a huge bellyflop. I wont spoil the ending, but it seemed like Matheson had writer's block and had to meet a deadline. The ghost is finally beaten when one of the mediums makes fun of it and calls it names. All the mysterious pieces are more hastily crammed together at the end, instead of fitting nicely to create a completed puzzle."
4,A good read!,A good read kept me on the edge. Great plot well written. Worth the price of admission.Joe
2,Poor imitation of Shirley Jackson,"Four people spend a week in a known haunted house, trying to prove or disprove the phenomena. Sound familiar? That's because Shirley Jackson already did it in the masterpiece ""The Haunting of Hill House,"" which I recommend 100% more than this book. ""Hell House"" is not scary. The storyline is choppy and the writing isn't good. Richard Matheson is a wonderful writer, but dropped the ball with this book."
2,Boring and predictable,"There are better works by Richard Matheson, don't waste money and time on this one."
5,Fantastic - everything it's billed to be and MORE!!,"I've been looking for this book for years, and couldn't be happier to see that TOR has had the good sense to reissue it. A fast, frantic, frightening read, this is right up there with Matheson's other classics: I Am Legend and The Incredible Shrinking Man. For those who claim not to be bothered by it, a challenge: read this one alone, in the dead of night, at home, with a good storm blowing around the house. It's scary without these props, but even more chilling with them!!"
2,"Overrated, Disappointing Horror Classic (??)","Might have been scary had I been 8 years old;I found it to be fairly disengaging. Gave up about halfway through-- too much Gothic description that doesn't really lead anywhere.Instead, read Matheson's I Am Legend. Now that's a true ***** star classic!"
4,a must read if your a horror/thriller fan,This is a really good book if you like a little suspense and horror. Richard Matheson gets his reader going and into the book...i feel like i don't want to stop until i'm done...I have read twice already and don't mind reading it for the third time...anothr book that's good but is not really connected to this one is Time Without End by Linda Leal Miller...that is also one book i would recomend...if u haven't read this yet...you have to...can't wait to read his other book called Duel...this is really good...read it...
5,Verrrrry Scarrrrrey !!!!,One of Mathesons' best. A Stay Up Late; Can't Put It Down; Hurt My Eyes thriller. I've got a first edition
4,Sweet Japanese Voice,"I was already familiar with Miyoshi Umeki's performances in movies such as ""Sayonara,"" and ""Flower Drum Song""; but when I read that she had a singing career before appearing in movies, I got curious. I was happy to find two of her 1960(?) LPs that recently became available as CDs. I bought her ""Miyoshi"" CD and was charmed by her sweet voice. On this CD, my personal favorites are ""Gone with the Wind,"" ""You Make Me Feel So Young,"" and ""They Can't Take That Away From Me."" This CD grew on me: The more I heard it, the more I liked it. I am just minutes away from ordering her other CD. By the way, through a bit of internet research on her before I bought her CD, I discovered that she lives in Hawaii and is 73 years old. I hope she's doing well because she made my day."
2,some changes can make this player great,"first off i bouht this little thing for 60$, about. I was kind of sceptical aabout buying it thinking wow it has radio, screen, 2gb's, movie and picture compaatable, I thought, a steel. so I bought it and I have to say it sucks.here are some tips for the creator of this little troublesome gadget.First off you need to put more gigs in this thing, second make the headphone jack 3.5 instead of 2.5, these dumb 2.5 headphones costed me 20$alone, redicluious. Next, make the screen bigger and make it so it doesn't freeze up when its 70 degrees outside. overall this would be a great product if it didn't have so many problem.I'm telling you, if you fix these problems, this could be an I POD massacre."
2,Money was right! Quality was not!,"I fell in love with the features when I was shopping for an MP4 player. However, I was buying it for my pre-teen daughter. So I did not want to spend an arm and a leg for something I was afraid she would lose after just a short time.I was pleased when I received the player at how straight forward I found the product. The manual was poorly written, but I didn't need it to load videos, songs, or work the voice recorder. I have never owned or operated any such device and was surprised I needed no help to use it.It was a great hit with my daughter as well, but after just 2 uses the battery failed to charge and the unit died.Now maybe, I just received a bad unit. But irregardless, there is no support number and no means of help. So, I am out the unit and shopping for another one."
2,Worst movie I have ever tried to watch!,"Concept was good, but execution was HORRIBLE! You could really see this was a first time effort at filmaking! Needless to say the students that got together to throw this together failed the class! Seriously, this was so bad I couldn't force myself to watch it all!"
4,Fantasy fans will dig this,Great fantasy flick. It's great to see stuff that's not in the mainstream be so entertaining. Destined to become a cult classic.
2,BEST I'VE SEEN,"I HAD THIS VIDEO A FEW YEARS BACK, GOT DIVORCED AND X MATE KEPT VIDEO I'M HAPPY I FOUND IT ON AMOZON .COM"
5,turned my pc speakers to a home theater!,i connected my tv RCA output to my computer speakers using this cable. It rocks!
4,Good story but tiny print.,"I liked the story very much, but I had to switch to the library book part way through, because the print was so small. If there is a way to know upfront about the print size in books ordered on line, I haven't found it. I've ordered hundreds of books over the years and have never had this issue come up. Even with my bifocals and good light I was really straining to read it. Yes, I have eye exams every year. Fast pace story, drew me in right away. Good choice, other than the print."
1,Breaks fast,"I had this plasma, it is really beautiful and relatively cheap IMO. The fact that it can work from AA batteries was also cool. Very nice product, only that it broke in a year, by broke I mean I couldn't see any more beautiful light inside, it was very faint and only one thread could be seen instead of multiple ones. I didn't crack the glass or anything, it was just sitting there on a table and it would gradually become weaker and weaker. I disposed it at the end, this thing should work more than for a year. (I didn't use it every day for 24 hours, I probably used it for about 200 hours max)"
4,bravely done,"The Stranger in Us is a great story of a young man trying to figure out is life, and while moody and poetic, the film keeps a truthful edge that never veers into indulgence."
1,"Nice, but does not do anything...","I used it for a few weeks, and did not see any difference in the cellulites."
5,"10 songs of ""Japanese"" and he ain't slowing down...","Funny thing, Jackie Chan ain't Japanese either. Go figure that. But he does that song, ten different times, ten different ways like blazing lions stomp on cowardice giraffe. Very good for all and super terrific happy fun time make for good show. Yeah. Go fun right now Mister Sparkle."
3,Leaner but just as bloody,"In this new incarnation, Slade (now father & daughter), have crafted a leaner style but just as convoluted,as usual. Great history, as usual. And also as usual, the reader is weary of the twists and turns by the time of the last surprise. Slade shows no reservation with disposing of characters you figure would be around for a while, that is different."
3,An ok read,"This is the first Slade novel I've tried, and it wasn't bad. The writing's ok, the story's ok, and the characters are pretty good. Now, keep in mind that it's a thriller and some of the stuff that happens is, um, unlikely, in a real world. Make shift hangman nooses I'm sure are not the easiest things in the world to set up, and one has to wonder about the amount of strength needed to do some of these things, but... The only problem I had with book, is the research done. While it's nice to read a book that has been researched, it's another to read all of it in a book. At the end, you'll know your hangmen history quite well. Like I said, it's an ok read."
3,Gave it away,"I accidentally ordered 2 different kinds of bowls, and figured I'd donate whichever one I liked least. I didn't end up liking that these 2 were connected, or that the bowls were the exact same size - a perfect size for food for my cat for the day, but kind of small to leave plentiful amounts of water, which I obviously want to make sure my kitten gets. I ended up keeping the Catit Double Diner in Pink, and I donated this bowl to the Anti-cruelty society of Chicago. But it's a fine bowl. Just not what I was looking for."
5,works great,"I take care of feral cats and these work out perfect. I can put wet in one side and dry in the other side for each cat and they don't fight, they have their own. Easy to clean too."
1,Garbage,"After ordering as a mother's day gift (in stock with estimated arrival before the holiday), I get an email 2 days AFTER mothers day stating the item is not available and should arrive before mid-JULY!!!!! Beyond furious, THANKS FOR A RUINED MOTHER'S DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,pilot hitch receiver,the title is a little decieving as it says chrome so i believing i was buying a chrome propeller.it is plastic!!!!!!i could have bought this at a local farm & family & chose not 2 because of that very reason
3,"It looks good, but it's all plastic and can break easily.","This propeller is made completely of plastic and does not include a pin to hold it in the receiver. It looks nice and spins well when you hit 50+ MPH. I owned it for about 6 months before it broke (which was the result of taking the truck through the car wash).You should either plan on taking it off before going through car washes, or spend a little extra on a better one. Now that mine has broken, I'll be looking for one that's more durable."
1,Crummy Hitch Propeller,It was made out of the cheapest plastic and the propeller fractured after 1 week...They should refund my money!!!
5,Willie Nelson's The Very Best of Willie,"Various of Willie's songs of this album have been reviewed in detail by the editors and customers elsewhere in amazon.com, and I'll just say that On the Road Again and Pancho are some of the reasons why Willie Nelson is one of the three greatest people in the history of Country Music, in my opinion. They call these Outlaw Country. I call them Spirit of the Law Country. Letter of the Law asks where, who, what, when, how. Spirit of the Law asks why. Which one do you think gets the answer?"
3,"Very Nice, but.....","This pendant is very nice. Nice size, color, shape,...but! The gold lettering is put on with some cheap glue. It fell off after wearing for about two weeks. Nowhere to be found to re-glue on."
2,Very short hikes,"We purchased this book because it had a lot hikes. Out of 107, only four or so are above 5 miles! So, if you like hiking, rather than strolling, get a different book. We are."
4,Surrenduring Innocence,"The Pact blends youth and tragedy through the eyes of a child. A child who must deal with the unfortunate consequences of being a true friend. I enjoyed the novel because it was so blunt. The joy was as clear as the misery. It addresses the issues that nobody wanted to talk about in the 1940's. Michael, the main character, shares so much insight even though he is only eight years old. We share with him the journey of realizing that life is not perfect, the good must come with the bad. His friendship with Rickey is a pillar for both of the boys to lean on. This story beautifully expresses the complexity of friendship and family. I think that anyone who has lost someone or can't imagine losing someone should read this book. It teaches us all that life goes on."
3,Never comes off,"Depending on who you are this is either a really, really good thing or a really, really bad thing. The adhesives on these are those foam stick strips with super-strong adhesive. These are NEVER coming off once you put them on, without damaging whatever they are glued to. I'm not sure why the adhesive is so strong on these.I accidentally misaligned one of the railways and it only touched the baseboard for a second, but it left behind glue and if it was on any longer I'm sure it would have pulled up the paint. It was on there HARD.RENTERS BEWARE. You're losing your security deposit if you use these."
5,The Fugitive DVD set,"I thoroughly enjoyed the DVDs. This is my all-time favorite TV series, and the DVDs were of very high quality."
2,Is this worth buying if you own last years complete series?,I own the complete series from last year-is there any reason in the world to buy this set as well? I understand about the music situation-that this set contains all the Pete Rugolo music-but i understood most of all his music is in the last years set. Is picture quality that much better? Because i thought the Paramount discs from last year were exquisite .
1,Painful to watch,"Had I seen a production like this early on, I might never have gone to another ballet.The corps de ballet dancing is sloppy and out of sync, sapping the impact of the ballet,the soloist performances tend toward the self indulgent, and some of the production values are over done,and some of the costumes laughable. Avoid this over-priced recording."
1,Terrible Movie a waste of time,"One of the worst movie I've ever seen. Terrible acting, terrible plot. This movie is complete garbage, save your money and your time."
5,Tranceformers Transform,"I enjoyed this book very much. It contains several valuable links to other related and pertinent material. It also contains information on VantageQuest that has perfected a brain wave entrainment tool on Compact Disc that helps you be more creative, and accelerate your personal growth and transformation. The main emphasis of this book is that trance - the method employed by shamens - is the doorway to the fifth dimension of cosmic consciousness. All in all, a very enjoyable book."
2,Tranceformers: Engaging and Intelligent,"Not an easy read, this book is full of speculative outside the body (and brain) information. Mr. Harper takes us on a metaphysical excursion, jam packed with references from people of questionable authenticity. You will like it if you're into subjective paranormal mumbo-jumbo."
2,Watch closely and it will become obvious.,"Given the talent of leads Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond, I settled in to watch this movie with high hopes. The ensemble was comprised of over the top characters, which draws even more attention to the smaller details and more grounded characters. There was a flaw in the third, maybe fourth, scene that made the ending predictable. That said, it was a story I kept watching simply because I had not seen characters like this before who were so unapologetic in their deeds and responses. Though it is not a movie I would recommend or purchase, it was no doubt memorable in its performances and its grim hopelessness. This is another movie in the fast-rising genre where extreme violence passes for horror. Unfortunately, Surveillance never rose above that nor took advantage of the unique qualities it did possess."
1,SUper Boring!!!,"This movie had the worst acting i ever had the chance of watching, I didnt think Julia Ormond would ever do a bad movie, or even Bill Pullman...but they did! I guess someome was trying to do a Pulp Fiction type ripp off, but did not succeed....DONT watch this movie...I love a good action flick with a twist at the end, but the twist at the end of this picture was nothing to wrtie home about."
1,A waste of precious time,"No, we long time movie goers are not psychic, but after so many years you can see the plot turns coming. The plot errors were readily apparent and I knew ""who dunnit"" within the first twenty minutes. After that, all that was left were the details and some hope for a point to the story. Now to be fair, I've only seen one other Lynch film, Mulholland Drive. I came away from it with mixed feelings, but decided to give this film a go, as I like Ormond. As a result, I am no longer ambivalent about Lynch. I officially hate his work. This film was a waste of good talent, resources and film stock. It was gratuitously violent and prurient, only serving to encourage the current taste for the pornography of death. Sorry folks, nothing redeeming, enlightening or informative here. Just a peek at Lynch's generally low opinion of humanity and determination that all women are drug addled, stupid, evil or psychotic. Save two valuable hours of your life and pass on this one."
2,"DISBURBING AND INTERESTING AT TIMES, BUT UNEVEN! 2 1/2 STARS!","I caught this film on HD Net and while the film starts off with a bang, it quickly looses steam as this crime drama goes into some long and tedious scenes where we learn very little. I like a good mystery as good as the next person, but I need some information and this film just doesn't give it up fast enough.The scenes where we are taken back to the events of the murders are interesting, but when we are subjected to huge doses of ""surveillance"" camera interrogations, this film really meanders. While I didn't figure out the twist right away, I did figure it out long before it was revealed.It's a shame because this film had some potential and I think with some better editing and writing this could have been an excellent film. As it is, it's an OK watch for fans of disturbing crime dramas."
5,awesome.,great story. cast fantastic. this movie had me guessing the WHOLE time.Julia Ormond is awesome. Bill Pulman is unreal.
1,pretty pointless....,"I really didn't see a point to this movie. I didn't find it entertaining although I am not a big fan of love stories. And from what I get this is just a love story with a brutal murder that took place. The ""brutal twist"" becomes predictable especially when the FBI agents discover nothing new in the brutal murder investigation. The dvd does have a few deleted scenes and an alternate ending which I preferred. The deleted scenes weren't anything that interesting...just a goopey kiss scene where the two characters are going at it like two carps trying to eat eachother and a couple trying to escape from unknown tormentors....oh and the brutality mentioned in this movie isn't especially brutal. Infact, it is rather tame. The only entertainment value this held for me was a few one liners Bill Pullman's character speaks."
1,Not worth the ingredients or effort!,"I took this book out from the library because of the reviews given. I made the 1-2-3-4 cake to use up some buttermilk I had. I looked on the back of the box of cake flour and saw this same recipe. The author changed from milk to buttermilk, and added baking soda besides the baking powder in the recipe. My cake overflowed all over my oven even though I followed instructions of using 3, 8-in. pans. The cake stuck to the pans, torn in clumps, I was able to piece it together because I am an expierienced baker. I never had this problem before and I bake from scratch quite a bit. It also had a poor quality texture. It was tasteless, and my husband only ate half a piece and left the rest. The last cake I made, he ate 2 pieces because he couldn't help himself, it was so good. I returned the book to the library the next day. THIS IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY to buy the book. There are too many really good books with great recipes to waste your time with this one!"
5,Great teaching tool.,This book was great! The system used in this to teach cursive was just incredible. Great for me and my child. Highly recommended for home teachers.
5,Great Collection,"If you love Johnny Cash and want some of his best songs, this is the collection for you!"
3,Not what it used to be!,"This dinnerware is no longer made in England. I purchased replacement pieces and see that they are now made in China. When the plates are stacked, you can see that they're actually somewhat crooked."
1,Buy a Bench,Extremely uncomfortable ergonomic chair. Researched this for 1 year but was unable to actually sit in this particular model. Adjustable tilt function does not work either and Office Star admitted this design \ marketing error.More of my money down the drain.
4,Excellent,This book is a must have for anyone interested in learning the caterpillars of Eastern North America. Color photographs are very good quality. It's definitely a very useful addition to the library. My only complaint is the lack of a distribution map.
5,Caterpillars of Eastern Northern America,"Had been looking for several years for a good caterpillar identification guide - this is it! First day I had it, identified five caterpillars that had been previously anonymous. Great illustrations, easy to use, good buy."
1,Simple List of Phrases,"I did not find this book and pair of cassettes at all helpful in learning Hungarian. The book consists of a list of Hungarian phrases, and the cassettes are just a reading of the phrases in English and then Hungarian. The phrases are read too quickly to understand, and the next English phrase is read before you can even think about what you just heard in Hungarian.If you were learning Hungarian and wanted to hear how a phrase was pronounced, this system could help, if you could find the phrase on the cassette! But they are just read one after the other with no guide to which cassette has the phrase or where on the cassette the phrase is located.It would be easier to go to Hungary and ask a Hungarian how the phrase is pronounced."
4,Surely you jest!,"ha ha. Sorry. I couldn't resist.When I first started reading Mimus, I was slightly skeptical. It was sort of an ""Oh God, not another plucky-younger-hero-faces-adversity-and-is-a-bloody-genius piece of shmaltz"". But it really isn't.The characters are actually quite fleshy. My personal favorite is Mimus, the suffering enigmatic jester who takes young Prince Florin (who improves as the story goes on) under his ragged wing.I also like the villain, King Theodo. He is a great villain, but he's not portrayed as a total fiend. He is a loving father, a devoted husband, and an all and all ok king. He's just also got this thing about locking other kings up and humiliating their heirs. Whatever.So try it out. It's not your standard medieval-fantasy stuff, even though it outwardly may seem to be."
2,"doesn't last, you get what you pay for","If you're looking for a good, durable case, keep on searching. This bag does the trick, it fits my doumbek perfectly, but it's very cheaply made and the ""backpack"" straps can not be used as a backpack. It doesn't protect your drum at all, there's no panding. Essentially, it's good for the handle if you need to grab it with one hand carry other things. Otherwise, this bag has no purpose."
1,Is it just me?,suction did not last long enough to remove anything - maybe i need to try popping? nosefrieda ended up as my choice.
3,Not as pictured,"The aspirator pictured worked great for us. Unfortunately, I tried to clean it by boiling it - wrong move. I ordered this item, sold by Baby Earth, and the only Summer Infant aspirator they carry is the green and white Dr. Mom one, which is what I received. I haven't had enough of a chance to use it to properly review it, but I thought people should be aware that if you order this product, you will receive something different."
2,"No suction, difficult to use","I tried to pretend this thing worked so my wife wouldn't thing I'm an idiot but the truth is, it doesn't. First, the bulb sticks inverted if you push it all the way in, you have to push in 3/4 of the way or unscrew it to push the bulb back through the other side. Second, the suction only works if you've got the perfect angle and a complete seal - both of which are incredibly difficult to achieve with a screaming, squirming 6 month old. Ultimately we find ourselves using the hospital aspirator and a q-tip to do a proper job. The good news - my 3 year old thinks it's a really fun ""toy"" so it's his now."
2,Difficult to use,"I tried to use it but it didn't work well, the thing you put in the nose is too large, and the succion doesn't last long enough to do a good job."
4,Heavy duty bicycle tube,"I have not used every bike tube out there, but these feel like they are built ""Ford Tough"". To describe the difference, I will compare them to plastic gloves. Your regular bike tube is like the cheap lunch lady type of plastic gloves. These tubes feel like the gloves that your dentist might use. If you want a stronger tube, think about giving theses a try. They are considerably heavier than a standard tube."
4,Number One Cup's most complete recording to date,Number One Cup's new album is their most complete recording to date. Part of that is attributable to the better production and part to their growing as a band. By having 3 good singers the album has a lot of different sounds that always keeps things interesting for the listener. Mitch Meyers writes in his review that they have little songs. There is nothing little about this band and anyone that has seen them live knows first hand about the power they produce while on stage. If they come to your city on their upcoming tour definitely try to catch the show for an hour of full force rock & roll.
3,Different.....But Effective,"Well, if you are looking for a horror-type film that is a break from the traditional film of this nature, look no further than this one. Charisma Carpenter plays a writer who has moved to a secluded house in the woods after suffering a mental breakdown. After arriving there, she begins to have visions of a mass murder that occurred in that area fifteen years earlier. Aside from Carpenter, the cast is not very well known, and the performances are not that good. Also, the film drags a bit as it tries to go too noir, opting for long pauses with no music or no action. But it ends up being one heck of a good story, and there is a decent bit of gore for the horror lovers. There is some suspense, too, for those who love a good mystery. One note of caution: if you are offended by a large amount of gratuitous sex/nudity, then this might not be the film for you, because it occurs all throughout the film, even at unexpected places."
3,Slow and Unfocused,"I was expecting a better movie from the name. I thought Psychosis was terribly unfocused on several accounts. The lead character, a writer is supposed to be mentally unbalanced. She was seeing several things that were ""unreal"" but there was never any ""real"" focus on that. The husband certainly had no pretense to her or me of being even a little concerned. This seemed unreal no matter what the circumstances were. I didn't feel any suspense for her to figuring anything out or becoming worse in her ""Psychosis"". The surrounding characters were just flat, where they could have been real colorful. And the sex scenes didn't add anything to it. I hate when movies have sex scenes just because they can. If it doesn't add something - please leave them out. The gory massacre at the beginning, infidelity, her writing a book, the creepy groundskeeper - none of it really tied into together very well. OK for a one-time viewing. I wouldn't watch again."
2,Sympthy for Chrsma,"It starts off promising, and it reminded me of how much I missed Charisma Carpenter, and she looks great, but then... into the movie comes this grody groundskeeper, and then the movie starts sympathizing with the sleazy husband, and rapist groundskeeper, and not only do I feel sorry for the main character she plays, but I feel sorry for Charisma herself; that she felt she had to do a gratuitous rape scene for this job. I would love to direct Ms. Carpenter, just to utilize her bitter comedic talents, something the director and crew did not care to explore."
3,was hoping for better,"i bought this because i like charisma carpenter i think she is a great actor but this movie was so hard to understand, im still not sure what i watched it was confusing. i love scary, horror movies but this one was just weird."
4,"Hard start, fun in between, but like any game, gets old.",Cool Boarders 3 is more advanced than Cool Boarders 1 or 2. It is the best of snowboarding games out there although this game is particularly more difficult to ascertain a hold on it. It's tricks are very elaborate but the speed of the game and the difficulty of the tricks make it a hard game to master. Going to the learning section on the game is probably the best tecnique before trying to master the halfpipe or even the regular arcade. =) Is that any help?
2,not so coolboarders,"this game did not live up to the name ""cool boarder"" it is the worst of the four and i rcemend you purchase coolboarders 2"
3,THIS IS LYE SOAP: Very harsh on skin,"This stuff is not a gentle cleanser. It's lye soap, and it's extremely strong so I had to stop using it only hands and back due to the trauma. I does smell quite nice, I must say. I tried using it as a detergent and it really sucked for that. Nowadays I just use it to wash my feet since they can handle extra abuse that other body parts (such as my groin) would freak out if I washed them with this stuff."
3,Let Me Add The Water!,"The soap seems ok, smells good, works ok. But it is is very thin, very watery. It's not just a little bit thinner than normal liquid soap, but very much thinner. The label lists water as the primary ingredient. Be super careful if you use a pump bottle for this soap, it shoots out with lots of velocity unless you are very careful.Paid good money to ship water across country. I wish they would let me add water after it arrived!"
5,best soap ever,"This soap is purely amazing. I discovered it a few years back. I buy little bottles like this and refill them from a gallon jug.It is a GREAT soap for those with new tattoos and piercings. Great cleaning, no scent or other junk like most soaps on the market.Also for people with skins allergies, rashes, yeast, etc....amazing. I have so many skin allergies and this does wonders. When my son was a baby he sometimes got diaper rashes (no many, we used cloth) and this helped clear them up really fast (the orignal reason I got it per pedi recommendation). Simply lather in your hands and apply bubbles to rashed area. Let sit over the area for a minute and rinse. If the area still feel moist, repeat. For rashes like yeast I would then melt pure lanolin (breastfeeding section of the store) and apply a thin layer over it. Within a matter of hours it will be better.I have used it for laundry once or twice when I needed to."
1,extremely drying! i threw it away!,"WORST. SOAP. EVER.do NOT buy!will dry out your hands like crazy!smells pretty bad toolike poo and rosesevery time i try a natural soap, it dries out my hands like insane!my skin on my finger even split!HATE it!well, on the bright side, i can buy the gallon of wal-mart soap insteadit might have bad ingredients, but it feels nice and my skin doesnt feel like hating it"
3,This product may not be a good fit for standard soap dispensers,"I was disappointed with the product: I was anticipating to buy liquid soap that I could use in my standard soap dispenser. Presumably because it is so thin (much thinner consistency than that of regular liquid soap), it squarts everywhere when you try to pump."
4,good stuff!,"Dr. Bronners is an excellent castile soap at a great value, especially considering the natural ingredients that go into it. It can be diluted and used in a foam pump. The foam soap pumps from bottles and foamers dot com are dirt cheap and they work. I've used this soap to wash produce and as a body wash. It works well but has a stronger mint smell and sensation than another store brand that I've tried. Because of this you might want to dilute and avoid using it as a body wash on sensitive areas. Other than that I'm very satisfied. It makes you feel fresh and clean but not at all dried out."
4,Smells great,I used this as body soap for its gentle cleaning and I like the almond fragrance. Too many soaps are designed to remove all the natural oils from your skin but we need those to keep the skin from becoming too dry. I would have liked to see this product be a bit more viscous so that it doesn't just run off of the loufa. Overall this product i recommend this product.
5,How could you not love bronners?,"Great product for a shower gel and baby shampoo. I feel very comfortable using this product because it only contains ingredients that I recognize as being natural. The almond soap would be better for a baby shampoo, but we used the peppermint when our daughter was young, with no problems."
5,fantastic camping/backpacking all purpose cleaner,"I bought a 32oz peppermint one based on Backpacker Magazine's recommendation. The 4oz bottle in REI sold for close to $5 therefore the 32oz here for $15 is a super bargain!.I chose peppermint so that I can use it as face/body/laundry/dish liquid and tooth brushing. A tiny little bit is MORE THAN ENOUGH to wash the face and neck. For you superlight backpackers, this is a must have for the functionality, weight to use ratio, and biodegradability.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
4,Good clean,I haven't used this specific one yet but I've enjoyed other Dr. Bronner's soaps and look forward to using this one.
4,"GREAT product, AWFUL packaging","We use Dr. Bronner's soaps for everything- diluted for our bodies and hair in the shower, dishes, cleaning most surfaces. A little bit goes a long way with this product, and it smells lovely. When it is used around the house, everything smells minty fresh.The only drawback to this purchase was - when it arrived it had spilled ALL over the box! There was only about a quarter of the contents left in the bottle. It was so sad! But, we contacted Amazon, and they did right by us. I'm sure that they will adjust their packaging standards for this item in the future, so it is totally worth the investment!"
4,Good soap to buy in bulk,"I really like this product, and I can buy it cheaper through Amazon than I can buy it directly through Vitamin Shoppe even though Amazon offers it by...you guessed it, Vitamin Shoppe.Since I have a lot of allergies to chemicals and fragrances, the grocery store brands irritate me. With castile soap, use it plain or add your own fragrances such as essential oils - those don't seem to bother me. Another positive is that it's fairly concentrated, so I do half water, half castile in my soap dispensers and it seems to work fine that way. By the time it's diluted, the cost is about the same as buying the cheapest liquid soap at our local Kroger. But you have to buy it in this particular bulk size to get the cost advantage - the small Bronners sizes can get pricey per ounce."
5,Excellent cleansing quality,Dr. Bronners castille peppermint soap provides a nice tingle in the shower for regular bathing. This product also provides tremendous cleaning for internal enema uses as well.
5,Organic soap that saves me money!,"This all natural, non-stripping cleanser saves us money on buying regular liquid hand soap. I pour a bit of this soap into my foaming dispenser and add water. Would def recommend doing the same thing!"
2,Caught Up in the Hype,"This soap made me realize how much I like soap lather. I never felt clean using this because it doesn't lather. I would use some with a loofa, and I'd have to add more 2-3 a shower session. I was going through way more of this than I would regular body wash! I'm sure it was cleaning just fine, but I have oily skin and need the ""reassurance"" soap lather provides.Basically, if you have OCD like me you may want to avoid this soap."
2,The Tea Tree smells bad,"this doesn't smell like tea tree I have used in the past. I think it smells like pine sol.I have used it twice in the shower after doing a dirty job, rinsed, then used the hemp almond to cover the smell. Not sure what to do with the rest of the bottle."
4,Minty,"Been using this for years. A little goes a long way, and it gets you clean and minty. Makes your eyelids and, um, some other parts, tingle like mad, to the point of being nearly annoying, but it is a transient sensation. Don't get this stuff in your eyes while wearing contacts, burns like hell. But that is true of many soaps. I use this stuff for both soap and shampoo, it is gentle enough for that, at least for a (non-metro) guy."
4,mmm...peppermint,"This soap is great for lots of stuff, like a wake-up body soap, or laundry. You really can dilute it a bit, as I do, for hand soap. A Really minty soap!"
5,What I wanted on time,"The Dr. Bonner's ""magic soap"" works well for me and I will continue to use. Price was right and shipment was prompt."
5,I like the product!,"I like Castile Liquid Soap so much 'cause its no toxic ingredients in it, so it doesn't dry your skin out! Worth buying =)"
1,Acne breakouts,"Dr. Bronner's Peppermint.Pros - a thorough cleanser for product loaded hair. Scalp did not break out in acne.Cons - do not wash face skin or any other skin with this soap. It makes me breakout in acne on face & back. Makes rash breakout on legs and arms.I wanted to love this product. I spent a lot of money, $10 for a liquid soap, hoping it would be good for everything. It's good only for washing very dirty hair, and only if you can wash hair without Dr. Bronner's touching your skin."
2,"I wanted to like it, and I do think it smells great, but...","I'm 37, and have really sensitive eczema-prone skin that seems to be like a lot of super-sensitive children's skin. I thought this would be great stuff, since EVERYONE seems to rave about it. Unfortunately, within 1 week of using it, I had a Molluscum contagiosum skin virus that caused little bumps to erupt all over my legs (btw, there was nowhere new I had been where I could have been exposed), and I also got a painful case of thrush at the same time. It was a horrible experience. I quit using the stuff and everything cleared up within a few days. If you have really sensitive skin, this may not be the product you're hoping for."
2,Too drying on skin,"I only used a few drops at first, and lathered it up for my arms. Then a few more for my legs, and the rest of my body. Odd to use if you're not used to watery liquid. The scent is definitely almond. I expected less of a drying effect since I read reviews that it wouldn't dry your skin. However, even the little bit that I used has made me itchy and dry, and I've used it once a day for 2 days. Certainly clean, but I'd rather go back to a soap with moisturizers/lotion in it even if it isn't 'natural'. At least I'm not dried out. All that hype about using natural products if getting over rated. I find they never work as well as commercial brands. I'll be going back to oil of olay, and return this."
2,Okay for hands and that is it,"This is fine for hand soap but don't believe the people who say it works as a shampoo. Maybe if you don't care at all what your hair looks like it's okay. For the rest of us who want to avoid hair that feels like straw and smells disgusting, avoid at all costs!"
1,"Gross, dry film - Buyer Beware!","Bought both the Peppermint and pure castille soap and was looking very forward to a clean shower. Used it first as a shampoo then a body wash--gross on both accounts! It became very difficult to move my fingers through my thick, curly hair, and afterwards hair felt coated in dry roughness and was unusually frizzy. Also used as a body wash, same effect. The water beaded right off my skin upon exiting the shower; I felt like someone had dipped me head to toe in dried wax. My skin was very tight and uncomfortable afterwards. I didn't experience the tingly sensations others mentioned, just a nasty film that coated my skin and stayed. I'm really disappointed in Dr. Bonners, since I've been making the switch to organic and harsh-chemical free products, I really expected to love this stuff. Instead, it clogged my pores and just made my skin and hair feel awful. After experiencing a terrible effect on skin and hair, I'm very hesitant to use it on anything else in my house."
4,DR BRONNER CASTLE SOAP,I THINK IT IS GREAT TAKES ANYTHING OFF OF YOU HIDDEN DIRT AND PARTICLES JUST HIGH PRICED AND IN WAALGREENS IT LOOKS A LITTLE THICKER
3,Didn't make a good shampoo,"I bought this with the intention of making my own shampoo. I was using it every few days for about a month but couldn't continue since it leaves such a terrible residue in my hair (even with very minimal use). I switched to using it as body soap (cleansing & shaving) and that has worked out well. I do love the citrus scent.I am sad that it did not work out as a shampoo, but I look forward to finding other uses for it. I have extremely sensitive skin, and this did not bother me at all."
5,Simply the best soap I've ever used,"I was introduced to Dr. Bronner's organic peppermint soap by a very health conscious girlfriend in California, way back in 1979, and I've been a loyal fan ever since. The tingly peppermint feeling I get when showering with this stuff is like no other soap product I've ever used. Just put a couple of squirts on a facecloth for a ton of super-rich lather that serves as both shampoo and body wash. Very refreshing. I ALWAYS keep a couple of big bottles in reserve. I never want want to run out of Dr.Bronner's excellent product."
5,Happy,"Frequent hand washing was leaving me with dry & irritated hands. Not any more, with my Dr Bronners soap. Only takes a few drops,So lasts a long time. A nice natural scent also."
3,Well..,"First off, I ordered Dr. Bronner's peppermint scented soap and I have to say that the smell is AMAZING. I read that a small amount goes a long way from a reviewer and it really does if you use a shower ""poof"" or sponge. Sadly, I didn't notice any difference from this soap and a organic/natural black soap I used to use. And after being out of the shower for awhile, I didn't smell like peppermint at all. That really sucks because I really do love that smell and find it to be quite pleasant.So I would only recommend this to someone who would want brief euphoria from a soap that will last them quite some time (which also saves money) but doesn't provide any big changes in skin smoothness or softness.."
5,WONDERFUL and VERSATILE!,"I mostly use the lavendar and peppermint liquid soaps. These soaps are the BEST! You can clean EVERYTHING with them. I use Peppermint and Lavendar a lot when camping. I use them for many reasons - but when camping they keep away most of the flying/biting insects including mosquitoes. I mix with water and spray the camping area. When washing my hair/face/hands in the camp ground - everyone always wants to try it. I'm a walking advertisment for this GREAT PRODUCT. Use it once, and you will become addicted. I also love to scrub my toilet &bathroom at home. Everything smells SO FRESH when you use the peppermint! Wonderful for the dog too!! I could go on and on; but after you try it you'll understand why. I had an old blanket that STUNK from our old dog sleeping on it, and then storing it for a year in the basement. NOTHING worked to get the smell out. But you guessed it - the peppermint completely took the bad smell out!"
4,Looks like a good product,I have not actually used it yet. I purchased it because I was working on a project and needed a glue gun. Well I was finished with the project before I received the glue gun and have not had occasion to use it yet. It seems well built.
2,Dead on arrival,"Extra star for the service, but out of the package the product never worked. Thanks to one of the previous reviews, I opened it immediately to test it. Sure enough it's a dud. Amazon's return/replacement program is awesome however, so a new one is on the way, dead one is in route back to amazon."
2,hard to feed,This glue gun is a great idea with poor execution. The refill glue sticks don't feed in well and the trigger doesn't advance them well. Maybe get better version.
4,"I gifted this, So I'm guessing its great.","My sister-in-law was happy, so I'm assuming this was great. couldn't tell you more if I tried. I did like that it came with two types of glue stick and a matt to use. that was really cool."
1,"Same ol', same ol'","This book was an utter waste of time. Not only is it the most awful piece of literature I have read, the story is completely redundant in each of the books contained in the novel. Pope and others were on to something when they criticized her writing. Haywood should have stuck to short stories."
1,Faulty Unit,"It's hard to rate this item since it wasn't functioning properly and I had to return it. I bought it, plugged in my system according to the instructions and a little while later, the unit shut itself off -along with my computer, etc., which is exactly what the unit it supposed to protect my computer from... I thought perhaps it needed to charge fully before plugging the computer in, so I plugged it in alone for the night and by morning, it had turned itself off again. I didn't want to risk buying another..."
1,No Way,I would never reccomend this kit to ANYONE. I tried this and it took 2 hours just for the black outline paint to dry. The stain glass paint was all runny and sticky. It was all gloppy and really didn't show up on the bottles and I just bought the kit 2 days before. The black outline paint had almost no paint in it. This kit stinks and I will never buy this again. This happend the other 5 times I have bought this kit. It is a waste of money and has no educational value.
3,Lest you be misguided by AllieKat's review below...,"...none of ""The Horse Goddess"" takes place in or anywhere near Ireland. The context clues alone are enough to tell you the story is not set in Ireland, but just in case you don't pick that up, read the Afterward. It is here that Llywelyn gives us more detail on Epona's alpine home - Hallstatt, in the Austrian Alps.More than anything this book shows just how far ranging the influence of the ancient Celts was, long before the word ""Celt"" became synonymous with the word ""Ireland"". While not as good as ""Bard"", ""Lion of Ireland"", or ""Finn MacCool"", ""The Horse Goddess"" is a good book - well worth reading, if for no better reason than to get background for Llywelyn's later books."
5,An amazing story,"Morgan Llywellyn, if you're out there and you are reading this, you are amazing!I want to have your child. I picked up this book out of desperation and boredom because I had nothing else to read, but alas, this book drew me in and kept me reading for hours. Morgan Llwellyn is, together with Anne Rice, the best English language writer alive today."
5,Just love it....,Wonderful improvement over the old one. Sharp and stable. I do recommend buying that glove which protects one's knuckles....
3,I cant wait till this gets rereleased!!!,"3/5 is a very harsh review score for me to give a KMFDM album, but once they rerelease it and do some ultra heavy remastering (they did a damn good job on the first 3), the 3/5 will turn into a 5/5.The sound quality on the original is just plain terrible. Thats the only real rant I have for this album. Despite that, the album has spewed out songs that are the reason why you should see KMFDM live.The enthusiasm put forth in this album makes it worth buying. Any metalhead or rivethead should get this album once its rereleased."
2,One good song,"The only song I like is ""The Problem"". A totally unusuall song by KMFDM standards. I wonder what possessed them to write it. Who knows... maybe it was sampled."
1,NEVER RECIEVED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Once again, Amazon has lost my order. Shipment was never recieved and now I begin the process of trying to locate it. Very poor communication on Amazon's part. I am thoroughly disgusted with slow shipping and above all else, lost product with no follow up."
3,"Enjoyable, but not a totally satisfying story.",I had the feeling through out that the character was being established for a series rather than creating a self contained novel.
4,read this review,this is a good book to start with after u get familiar with thebasic rules of chess like how to move pieces castle and all that stuff. this is like a primer for beginnersif u have played well over some 100 games to 200 games u may need it no promise there but if u have played well over 500 games think twice or thrice because it is quite basic well can handle the rest
2,RAMBLING OLD MAN,"This was a brief and unique book. I picked it up after reading I Served the King of England, and though I would not necessarily recommend this book, I thought its style was commendable. There were approximately 100 pages in this book, all rambling chatter without any stopping points or punctuation. If you can tolerate such a thing, go ahead and read it. Otherwise, well, pass it up."
3,Excellent for single line phones,Do NOT try to use it with a phone that supports one than one line though. It will cut off the call you are on everytime someone rings in. Otherwise wonderful for a desk top unit.
3,3 1/2 stars - not bad but not great either,"In The Last Don, Puzo again delves into the realm of organized crime families. He spins a tale of the aging Don of a powerful New York crime family who yearns-and plans-for a day when future generations of his family can transition from the world organized crime to that of legitimate enterprise. As the story unfolds, the Don, who is at the same time a strategic thinker and a ruthless tactician, attempts to influence people and events in order to realize his long-term vision. Along the way, Puzo lays out a wide range of colorful, although stereotypical, characters in a story that brings a variety of disparate storylines together as the book progresses. Puzo effectively moved back and forth from the present to the past to provide depth and understanding. In the end though, the book never really grabbed me or prompted any sleep deprivation due to late nights spent reading. The Last Don was definitely not great, but not bad either."
1,"Hopefully, this IS the last don","Round up all the usual 'dis and 'dat mugs and attempt to beleive that Mafiosos are cool guys. A complete waste of money. Is this a puff piece for the Mob? Isn't everyone just a wee bit bored with a bunch of lugs with baseball bats, fascist political sympathies and bad clothing? Personally, I hope this is the last of the dons I;ll be seeing for quite some time. This ranks up there with ""Nixon-the autobiography"" and pictures of my dog. Utterly forgettable"
2,Puzo's Worst,As someone who has truly enjoyed the works of Mario Puzo over the years I was terribly disappointed in this book. The book reads as though Puzo has taken bits and pieces from previous books and pasted them together. The only thing saving this from 1 star was Puzo's incredible command of language. But for the most part the characters were hollow and the plot was thin.
1,Hopefully The Last Puzo too!,"For years after The Godfather Mario Puzo tried to write other novels. But now, all these years later The Last Don represents the full circle of Mario Puzo. Did I say full circle? I don't think he's moved anywhere actually. The Last Don is a bad Godfather clone, period. The sad part is of course that it comes from the author of that blockbuster. It pains me to see Puzo ... like this. But hey, the guy needed money I guess and figured he ain't writin' too many more 500 page novels so he might as well cash in with this and the inevitable TV movie. No secret who the Ernest Vail character represents: a bitter, disconcerted... Puzo. Hopefully this is The Last Puzo as well!"
4,"Fun, stunning visuall and very erotic.","The movie really looks great. It claims to be shot in film and it looks it. The erotic stuff is completely different than anything I've seen. This is not a porno movie, but I got into it and excited. Me and my boy friend watched it three times. Great twist at the end. And amazing fetish. I was very surprised by it. I can see why it won the Fetisch Film Festival in Germany."
1,Not for Nokia 1200,"The title of the item is misleading, the label on the box states that it supports 1100, 1261, etc., but no 1200.When I plug it into my 1200, the screen shows ""enhancemant not supported""."
4,Raggdy Andy,This was bought as a gift and she was thrilled when she opened it. Now Annie has a playmate:)) The item was shipped quickly and the description was perfect. Exactly what we wanted. Thanks
5,Great toy that is safe and cuddly that the child will enjoy.,Loved the Raggedy Andy as he is truly authentically dressed and will be a companion to read with and hug.
5,A True Memory,I had the opportunity of working the night Willie played at Airport Grocery and it truely was a wonderful experience.
3,"Show's still good, DVDs are still bad","My major problem with the Simpsons DVD box sets are still there: the packaging is bad, it's too much of a pain to find the episode you want without sticking every disc in the player, and the audio commentaries...oh, the commentaries. These commentaries are done by professional sound people and yet they sound like someone buried a microphone in the sand at the beach, scattered everyone in an irregular circle, and told some people to shout against the wind. I have a feeling that there's some money around somewhere that can be used to get whatever the super modern equivalent of a lapel mic to EACH person in the commentary. Finally, last bugaboo: the horrible elavator jazz played during the menu screen that NEVER STOPS. It blows, first of all, and hey, what's wrong with, you know, quiet?"
3,"a lanauage option, no ""play all"" function.","The product description noted many lanauges available in audio but it was not when played. There is no ""play all"" option so I had to bother to click every time an episode ends."
2,Maybe I'm expecting Seasons 1-6!,"I might be too harsh on the producers of The Simpsons but for me the lean years were 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Perhaps they just did too much of the same-old-thing but it just didn't sing like the first few although after 12 got about halfway through I felt as though the writers got back on track and rememebred how to WRITE FUNNY LINES. I never gave up on The Simpsons, even in the depressing Season 9, and I'm glad I didn't but I wish gthey would have tried harder for this set of shows."
2,Unlike Medwyn's nostalgiac compositions,"The ""Millennium"" is different from the conventional Medwyn compositions. Medwyn's trademark Preuvian flute is missing and that is the biggest letdown. I strongly recommend ""Medicine woman"" and ""Dolphins"" if you are an ardent Medwyn fan."
2,Great idea - design needs some improvement,"Love the idea of just dropping in your coffee grounds/loose tea, pouring hot water - and then leaving the house. So far, I can successfully filter coffee/tea about 1 of every 3 tries. The rest of the time, I'm drinking grounds/tea leaves. I wish the mouth had a mesh strainer (like our French press) - this takes care of any small bits that sneak out of the filter. Or I need to perfect my super-steady, super-slow pressing technique. But I'm not really the type of person who has that much patience - I mean I bought a to-go cup because I don't have time to drink at home!"
3,"Super convenient, but not perfect","I love the convenience of this mug because I love french press coffee. It saves me a few crucial minutes in the morning. However, the press isn't perfect and usually leaves some grounds in my coffee. I'm not too picky, so I don't mind too much, but if you're really particular about your coffee, you might not like it for that reason."
5,really good mug,bought this for my wife and she loves it the built in press is perfect for tea and coffee
2,You WILL Be Crunching on Coffee Grounds!,"The other reviewers have properly characterized this product. I like it, but it has that one fatal flaw..."
1,Don't buy this!!!,"This travel press coffee cup is not a well made item. Before I even used the cup, the lip that covers the top broke off and could not be fixed. Then when I went to wash the cup, the filter part unscrewed from the Press. When I tried to make coffee, first you screw on the top to press the grounds down. Then take the top off to add your milk & sugar - now screw top back on...... I am not happy with it."
2,Pay Attention To The Reviews,"I read the reviews and bought this anyway (not on Amazon btw) and am really, really disappointed. The first one had the press stuck in the bottom and I had to exchange it. I finally got all the stickers cleaned off the second one and tested it. Look, I know how to use a French Press coffee maker, I know what grind to use and how to use it. You still get grounds with this mug. I'm going to keep it but not to make coffee, just to keep the coffee hot after making it in something else. A nice travel mug; a lousy French Press!"
1,Terrible Coffee Press,"This was an impulse buy at Whole Foods a couple of months ago. I am so sorry I didn't come to Amazon ahead of time to read these reviews; I would have saved myself $20. This Coffee Press STINKS!! I use it on a medium grind coffee, and have tons of coffee grounds in my cup of coffee EVERYDAY. I hate it! I have tried every different way of plunging I can think of, but grounds still escape the filter. I don't even drink out of the plastic cup. I add the coffee grounds, then the water, let it steep and then pour it into a regular coffee mug. I then scrap out as many ""floaters"" as I can manage and still end up with a cup full of coffee grinds.Very poor design execution. Please save your money."
2,Useless,"My daughter found it too hard to turn the handle. The fluff became twisted and stuck in the machine. The zipper broke on two of three bears. After the three bears were stuffed (by hand), it now sits in the closet."
5,Well Done,Great collection by Alison Tyler. Well written little shorts that are sizzling hot yet intelligently done. Great for sharing with your lover.
2,Warning!!,"I'm writing this review just so that others with the same taste as me don't make the same mistake I did (and actually buy it)....and for those of you who like this album, my hats are off to ya.I spent the last 10 years getting familiar with, and re-familiarizing myself with Psykosonik's Unlearn album...it is absolutely amazing! The self-titled album on the other hand, is so not like Unlearn....it's a completely different genre. It's very PWEI, old school brit house sounding with an old school rave flare - if you like early 90's booty dance music, then this is for you. There maybe one or two songs that I personally can tolerate.My apologies to those who really do like it, I dont mean to be offensive. I was expecting early 90's dark wave synthpop, like Unlearn, and got something completely different. And I swear that there werent any song samples the other day when I ordered it, or I would have listened to them first...."
1,VERY DISSATISFIED!,I was very displeased with the product I recieved. It came very late and was not the quality I expected.
2,Bizzy Get's Bizzy,"I admit, I love some Bizzy Bone so that is the main reason I purchased this DVD. I also love Timothy Wayne Forsome. He is a very creative director, and I support black indies movies. Bizzy Bone gives and all out performance, as he makes you laugh as well as look in awe at times. The lead actor is a very good actor and you may see him on major roles soon. It's a decent movies but not all that good, could have been better."
1,HOT sizzlin dog mess on a bun,"Ummmmmmmmm, did we see all see the same movie b/c what I saw was complete and utter garbage. This is something you watch when you are a quadriplegic and dont have the strength or the opportunity to change the channel or crush the DVD. The only thing that was interesting is how Bizzy's ""tendencies"" were slammed to the forefront. This aint even good enough to sleep on or use as a coaster for my drink. If you want to get a good laugh at the bad acting then I suggest you see this mess. I give it five stars for bad acting and unrealism. What a waste of two hours out of my life. I rather sit on a sizzling hot space heater for two hour than be subjected to this mess. Trash this DVD."
5,Espresso pod perfection,"Lavazza Grand Crema is well named (great crema!), and tastes great. For decaf fans, the Dek pods are the best of the bunch (according to my wife--I don't drink it). Having 150 of these blue beauties arrive promises a LOT of great Americanos and espressos."
4,Good product pour in flavor,"Compare with others strong Italian pods, it is softer then the ones from Naples. If you like just for the foam that comes on top of the coffe, then it a great product."
5,Powerman is quite the kicking group,"When i first listened to PM5K i was in awe. They are original, they are metal, only not. I like their sound, buy it now, or i will be dissapointed. PM5K rocks!"
5,AWESOME,"This CD only has 7 song, and your probly thinking ""Seven CD's...eh i'd rather buy something else with a bit more music...DON'T! This CD is one of the BEST CD's EVER MADE! Pm5K Completely rocks on this cd! This is definitly worht the money, and you will love every second of this CD!"
1,I truly love pm5k but hate this....,I'd rather listen to a fast talking nerd explaining physics..ha!
1,Horrible quality,"They look great, everything looks almost the same as the original ones, but they don't work, at first, I thought it was the cheap lightbulb that came with the product but even after I changed it the headlight did not illuminate the road correctly. And yes the lights were adjusted."
1,Low quality part,"I bought two headlights, one from this company, the opposite from another company. They are like night and day. This one 1) doesn't make nearly the light that the opposite headlight does and 2) one of the 2 adjustments on the unit broke almost immediately during headlight alignment. I'd like to contact TYC directly, but there appears to be no way to do so via my order / Amanzon. Nice."
5,Good Product,"I bought both the passenger and driver side modules in Oct. 2012 for a total of $68 (sans tax) for the pair so as to replace the extremely yellowed-out modules on my 1999 Chevy Venture. It took me about 30-40 minutes overall, and I was taking my time while doing it. I am in no way, shape or form an auto mechanic -- no experience needed to swap the modules out. To remove the old ones you just first remove a few thumb screws, unplug the modular electrical harness and lift them off -- just pay attention to how the side lights interconnect as you remove the original modules and that will help you put the new ones in. To install the new ones, just ensure that the 4 install points line up as you slide the modules in and you should have no problems. The 4 points need to go in simultaneously for the easiest install, i.e., don't try to put the bottom part in and then the top connections, or vice versa. They fit perfectly, look sharp and I have absolutely no regrets in making the purchases."
1,Not what it seems,"These are thin and have a sticky back, not noted in promo. Also has a center clip not shown. Not what I expected"
4,Excellent Teaching Philosophy Book,I was required to read 5 books on Christian School Philosophy.I enjoyed this book the most!An Easy Read that inspires the everyday Christian Teacher.
5,"This CD, full of pleasing, distinctive selections, is great!","What makes this album a pleasure to listen to, for me, is its distinctive sounds that do not hit you over the head with artificial, studied ""New Age"" or ""jazz"" themes. Instead, the musicians as individual players and thinkers are reflected in each selection, as is the unique spirit of the Northeastern United States. The selections move from one theme to another with fluidity, and the sounds are, in turn, bold, gentle and calming, and compelling. I find the combination of musical instruments easy to listen to. I really enjoy the reflective mood the album creates for me."
4,"Great Game, Poor Ending","It was a great game. Night and Day compared to ""Enter the Matrix"" It took a little bit for the game to get going but once it did you were off. The ending took me by surprise and that's why it doesn't get five stars. Overall, fun game well worth what I paid for it."
4,I know Kung Fu.,"Excellent game. The action is non-stop, and the story is well adapted from the movies. I did feel that some of the missions from outside of the movies were a tad weird and possibly the result of too much acid, but it was still really fun. The hardcore Matrix fans will love it up until the final 1/3rd of the game. After that, it goes way out there and never comes back."
5,Lace Bra Lovers !,"I have three Wacoal bras now: all 3 all lace, two have the standard strap arrangement and one is a racer back.I look forward to wearing them and often will wear one for nearly 24 hours. Playtex - eat your heart out !"
5,Good for narrow shoulders,"I have trouble finding bras for my narrow shoulders, but the straps on this one sit perfectly in the right position. I wore it all day yesterday (hot sweaty day) and didn't have to readjust myself at all."
4,Fantastic!,This was a great book and I can't wait for the next one. Finally an accurate portrayal of the many cultures represented in ancient history. Good Character development also.
5,Ellen Allien - Berlinette,"A great album from Ellen Allien -- BERLINETTE has all the qualities goingn for it: funky, bright, moody. The opener ""Alles Schen"" is a shiny piece of tech-house, all the more catchy with her mysterious German vocals. The track develops in fascinating ways: when the vocals reappear, it's accompanied by both a delicate descending synth line and some electronic squiggles. ""Sehnsucht"" is much more straightforward in its darker sound that grows in intensity and mood. The funk breaks on ""Push"" certainly do kick ass, while the breaks get a little more abstract and industrial on ""Trash Scapes."" ""Augenblick"" and ""Wish"" both show the more thoughtful side of Ellen Allien. ""Open"" closes the album, with a artful blend of tech-breaks, guitar and industrial hiss. This great blend of styles and techniques make for an outstanding album."
1,Unsatisfied Customer,"Since this is a diamond, I did not receive any Guarantee Certificate to guarantee its authentic caratage."
1,NOT the old Progresso Clam Sauce,"Progresso has changed hands a couple of times. I remember when Progress Clam sauce was great! It used to come in bottles with GREAT ingredients. THEN, they came out with a canned version with terrible ingredients but STILL made the superior sauce in the bottle. They now did away with the superior bottled sauce and only sell this canned version. The bottled clam sauce still had the great indredients and no chemicals like MSG etc.Their present canned variety is horrible. The old one had ALL Olive Oil, not just a little added so that they can say it on the label. The old version did NOT have MSG and all the other chemicals that this one has. Brand Loyalty is a bad thing to fall into.This is NOT the Progresso Clam sauce of old. It sucks!"
4,White clam sauce w/macaroni,"I checked all of the grocery stores in the area (Safeway, Smith's, Basha""s, etc.) and none of them stocked this item anymore. Amazon not only stocked it, but it was cheaper (Except for the shipping charge)."
5,Best computer Headset ever.,The most comfortable headset on the market. EarHugger has done it again. I would recommend this product to anyone. The soft plastic frame makes this the most commfortable headset around. You must by this now!!!
5,Riviting. Each book as engaging as the first.,"In The Ringed Castle, Dunnett expands her screen. The 16th Century was a time when the world was tittering and swaying on the edge of a global world. Lymond, in Russia, and in his relationship with Chancellor seems to be aware of this and be reaching for something much bigger even than Russia. They both seem to be sailing into the age of Englishtment and the voyage is lethal and dangerous. Within 100 years, that complex world they know will be utterly destroyed and replaced with something much more grim. In this book Lymond finally falls in love. (I also wish Dunnett would include translations for her non-bilingual readers.) I, personally, don't think I have ever been more enthralled by a hero."
2,Do-it yrself Immigr. Kit:How to apply for a fiancee visa,"I thought this book was fair, but had most information already available by the INS. Some information was not accurate such as e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and fees involved by U.S. Embassies overseas. It still left questions unanswered, but was good for someone starting without any knowledge of the fiancee visa process. I expected it to answer issues left unclear by the INS, but had to go to the U.S. Embassy website for Russia in order to find accurate information about the process and fees. By itself it is only enough to do the application which could be done by INS instructions. It was not really worth the cost, but was good to have to show the documents that your fiancee will receive overseas. I wish it would have been more up-to-date as far as overseas fees such as the medical exam fees, the visa fees, and what your fiancee must do. It is a good reference, but not complete enough in content."
5,Its Finally Released ON DVD Officially!!!!!,"Canada Has released this on DVD Finally, for some reason no body seems to know about it cause people are still asking and hoping for this to be on DVD, WELL IT IS!!!

And you might also see whats missing on the second disc. I got mine somewhere else, cause for some reason Amazon no have it. Except for the U.K. page, and Canada's. So Now you know. Go Get It!!!!!!!!"
4,Useful book,"Very useful and practical book. The irony of most of these kinds of books is that if you really need a time management book, you won't actually make the time to read the time management book, much less put the lessons into practice.Unlike most ""get organized"" books, this one doesn't require very much time investment (1-2 hours) to start seeing a benefit. You can start by just following the step-by-step instructions to reconfigure Outlook so that the task system works more intuitively than the default settings in Outlook. I've done that, and it's worthwhile.The ""mastery"" sections are optional and available when you have time to invest in time management."
