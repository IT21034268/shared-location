4,Almost a perfect hit,"I enjoy Davidson's writing style -- no gratuitous sex, no grisly descriptions of violence, no bad language. It may be too clean for jaded city folks.I enjoyed this particular book very much, and I always look forward to her next one. Her recipes are always excellent -- I've made many of them. The architectural descriptions of castle life in this one were somewhat sketchy, but interesting."
1,Sticks and Scones is a disappointment,"As a longtime reader of Mott Davidson's, I found STICKS AND SCONES disappointingly disjointed and implausible....Loose ends, and too many leaps of logic. Besides which, juvenile son, Arch, gets more tediously obnoxious as the years go by with NO redeeming qualities, and ex-husband, John Richard, keeps up harassment that NO wife of a police officer would ever have to endure. I know this is fiction, but no heroine can be interesting being as much of a career victim as Goldy is.Even the recipes in this book are disappointing."
3,You've got to be Kidding,"I forced myself to finish this book, thinking something great would happen. The entire setting, however, was hard to swallow. A rebuilt castle?? A gothic chapel gifted to a parish church?? Even the discovery of a pricey letter wouldn't cover that scenario in this day and age. Getting past the setting, the people seemed overly sterotypical with few realistic qualities. The redeeming facet of the book was the author's ability to describe food and cooking by Goldie who is sometimes smart and other times really stupid. The book made me hungry which I guess was a tribute to the use of adjectives. On the other hand, I might have been better off reading a cook book."
3,Disappointingly unsolvable,"This is the second Goldy mystery I read (completely out of order, I know) and it was pretty good, though there was that touch of the supernatural in it - not what I like in my standard mysteries. It does, after all, make them unsolvable! And what fun is it reading a mystery unless you can try to figure out whodunit? But if you're not the sort that feels the need to solve the mystery, and enjoy simple, cozy mysteries, this seems a good series. Nothing earth-shattering or spectacular, but solid writing and decent plots."
5,GREAT SHOW,I ENJOYED WATCHING THE SHOW. IT HAS SUSPENSE OF WHO WILL BE OUT AT THE PIT STOP. NO COMMERCIALS IS A DEFINITE PLUS. GOOD QUALITY DISCS. I ENJOYED ALL THE SEASONS THAT I HAVE ( 1-9 ).
3,"okay, but not in the ""practically new"" condition that was advertised","Typewriter worked well, but seemed to be used more than a few times. The back of it was cracked and it was very dirty."
4,Ultra absorbent but tend to shrink a little,"Bought this for my wife, and we tried them against some disposable ones that came with the Avent Pump.By far this pads are better than the disposable ones because they where more absorbent than the others.We had to buy 3 paks to be able to have 9 pairs and not have to recycle them every 3 days. With 9 pairs she can go an entire week with those pads.The only CON my wife found is that they tend to shrink a little when you wash them for the first time."
3,it works,The product absorbs breast milk well. My bras still get wet once in a while. They shrink a lit bit after washing.
1,Pick Something Else,"I would have to say that no engineer built/developed this thing,if one did they received their degree from the bottom of a cracker jack box. Putting this thing together was a bit of a challenge due to the placement of the bolts you need to tighten. It was very clear that the product I received had been put together once before, because the three areas that you need to screw/tighten were all scratched to hell (yep right out of box) One would think that they would of sent me a new unit (that's what I paid for) but it was clear that the unit I received was used before I got it. Once together it did the job, but required some skill to not tip the unit on turns. Save your money for something else, do not buy this unit."
5,A must see!,"My husband I watched this when it aired on the History Channel. We both were memorized and could not quit watching it once it was on. It is the best survival story ever told and how they never gave up. I recommend this show for everyone to watch. You ask yourself if you could of done what they did, to keep going and to never give up. It is a very insperational film. I am buying at Christmas Parents this year and keeping one for myself. Watch this story with kids, and family. You will not regret it."
5,Wonderful change of pace,"I loved their first album, but I also love the folky overtones of this release. Only a band of major talent can pull off such a switch in styles. The Delgados have become a band to watch closely with great delight."
1,This CD is Awful,"this cd sucks, don't be fooled, it is not a JAy-Z cd. It has one Jay-Z song. all the rest is crappy songs and the music is slowed down (screwed), and it sucks."
5,Excellent interpretations,"This is my favorite of a handful of versions of the music from ""The Gadfly"" and contains the single best performance of the famous ""Romance"" - also known as the theme from ""Reilly - Ace of Spies"". An essential recording for those who love the music of Shostakovich."
4,Interesting channeled perspective on Earth history,"This material is channeled and claims to be from a council of beings in the Sirius star system. It discusses themes of polarity struggle and manipulation of civilization that seem pretty valid, although it seems to over-simplify some concepts and issues. This book is part of a series, and explains how things have come to be where they are now in our civilization, presenting optimism for positive transformation, to be addressed in the subsequent volume of channeled messages. I consider this material to be alien ""propaganda"" to some extent, presenting useful information and insights accompanied by ""spin"" to ingratiate the messengers as humanity's ally and a source of help in the time of chaos and transition. It is a very readable compilation and presents some good insights, but as with even the best channeled material, it has limitations and flaws."
2,Interesting concept doesn't pan out,The concept of parallel plots is intriguing. I found myself a little disinterested with this one. I don't know if it is just that Gwenyth Paltrow didn't hold my attention or the story itself was lacking. I have seen Gwenyth in many Jane Austen films and had no problem with her English accent but this time it seemed a bit contrived to me. I won't belabor the plot as you can read about it yourself in the movie description . Suffice to say I streamed it on my Kindle Fire and found myself advancing the stream to get to the end.
2,Dim Display,I bought this scale for my father who has poor eyesight. The display is large but there is so little contrast that he cannot read it. Very disappointing.
1,Horrible Programming Book,"This Java programming book, which I am using in school for Computing Fundimentals I is a joke! It gives you basic ideas on how to start programs, but once you run into a problem then forget about it cause the book sure isn't going to help you. The text is hard to read, let alone understand. The examples are very vague and don't help you understand the concept of what is being done. The examples shown in the book aren't anything like the programs you are working on in class which doesn't help when you try to use the examples for help. The author does a very poor job or teaching the readers anything of signicant importance."
5,Great Book by Malik (as always),"This is a great ground-up Java book, I was suffering with the book prescribed by my university, but I've benefited a lot from another book by Malik and, again, he did not fail me.Believe me ,and I've searched a lot, it's a great and easy to follow book, and only a lazy student who likes to watch ""wonder years"" rather than studying will think otherwise."
2,Misleading product description,"It is described by the seller as a ""Flat clinch standard stapler"". No mention is made that it is only a ""half strip"" stapler as is clearly marked on the box when you receive it. Leaving ""half strip"" out of the description leads the buyer, like me, to believe you are getting a stardard full length stapler. This is only a half stip, so do not make the mistake of comparing it to other full strip staplers. If you compare to other short half strip staplers, you will find that other sellers offer a better deal."
1,Sound activated??,"My son 6 month old son was fascinated with Eeyore in the store, so I purchased it for him. When I pulled it out of the box and tried the sound activated rattle nothing happened. I read the box further and read that the rattle or clapping would activate Eeyore after you pressed his hand. Well, I pressed the hand and Eeyore came to life with a question of ""Do you want to play peek a boo?"" I rattled the rattle and clapped my hands to have Eeyore simply hide behind his ears. I replaced the batteries and still the same thing. I returned Eeyore to the store and got another one. Still the same thing. Eeyore is not sound activated folks. You have to keep pressing his hand or have to wait for 10 second pauses for him to do anything. Then of course after the 2 minute period he just shuts off. I do not recommend buying this toy."
5,Wonderful,This is a compilation of 2 albums of Christmas music from my childhood. It is wonderful to hear the music and arrangements again.
5,My daughter loves this one!,I got this book for my daughter when she was 2 years old. She is now nearly 4 and still loves it. It's adorable. I'm a big ancient Egypt buff so I was excited to find a fun storybook dealing with my favorite subject to share with my daughter. It's a fun read.
2,Plastair coiled water hose,"I thought the concept of this hose was great, unfortunately in a real life garden it is not.Don't think because this hose is coiled it will not kink, in fact it kinks more than any hose I have ever had.As long as you keep tension on the hose from the faucet it works good, however loosen the tension or walk back toward the faucet and you have a tangled mess. A mess that is a real bugger to undo.The coiled hose tense to be a real hazard to your small plants, delicates & pots it reeks havoc on them.All in all, I salute the idea and the only real good I am getting out of this hose now is for tying up my trees.Yes, I cut the hose up into pieces and I am using this for tying trees to stakes for this I give it 5 stars forwatering my plants it gets 2 stars."
2,Disappointed,"Was originally excited to use this b/c we have a small front yard, and a smallish backyard, but it fell short of my expectations. When the water's turned on, it reduces the water pressure a lot, so when you use a garden trigger, you don't get the same effect. Also, it's not as easy to move it around the yard as I thought it would be, which is one of the main reasons I got it."
5,Brilliant compliation of Thoreau's most prolific quotes.,"Take this pocket size book with you everywhere. In On Man and Nature, one can read of Thoreau's more passionate thoughts from his various works. It is truly a book to take for a ""pick-me-up"" at any time of the day in any place. My personal favorite is ... ""Take time by the forelock! Now or never! You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in every moment...."""
3,"what, no commentary track?","i love this movie and most of bergman's early material. beautifully shot, profound metaphor, and dynamic acting all fall under bergman's talent. my only complaint: where is the commentary track? when criterion usually releases movies, especially with the more popular directors, they add a commentary track by some film historian. it is oddly missing. makes me wonder if they plan a double dip and re-release this at a later date with added material. something that they have done in the past. with the amount of work and preparation that goes into presenting these movies, you would think a commentary track would be a no brainer and adding it later on is basically ripping off the consumer and collector."
5,Another fabulous 'How to' Guide from the Mountaineers Books,Mountaineers Books did it again!!! This book has such clear diagrams and descriptions of glacier travel and rescue techniques. Thank you for continuing this 'how-to' series. I look forward to the next book in the series.
2,Very poor printing quality,"I bought this set based on several earlier reviews I have read, but unfortunately I didn't scroll down to see the other unfavorable reviews. Hopefully you get to see this one before making a decision. This book is very very poorly produced, the paper is too thin so the letters on the other side comes thru and creates double images; combined with the small type face, and the strong odors from the ink makes me wonder how can anyone withstand the ""hardship"" reading this book entails? I expect something like this in the 3rd world country.Doesn't matter how good the translation is, I will never find out, as several attempts to read the book had instead made me nauseous.I bought the one published by the Foreign Language Press."
2,A little short on yoga,"Hi, I'm a yoga fan, and Dona Holleman is a lesser known teacher and garden variety mystic. This is a very short film--maybe 25 minutes, and you get some images of Dona doing the postures and giving us some background and hiking with her girlfriends and going into a cowboy bar--I came away not really knowing why she teaches and practices yoga, except as a profession, but she does aim at some kind of mystic link with the ""universe"". It was okay but I wouldn't buy it again--and Netflix doesn't carry it."
4,Sweet story,"SEP is a master of light, contemporary romances and this story doesn't disappoint. It has all the right elements - good tension between the hero and heroine, interesting plot, great secondary characters, and lots of good romance. I wouldn't classify it in my top 5 favorite SEP books, but it is still very entertaining. Daisy is a very charming heroine and Alex kind of grows on you as the story enfolds. The background story about the circus is creative."
3,Not Susan Elizabeth Phillips Best,"I've read several of Susan Elizabeth Phillips' books and so far this was my least favorite. The union of Daisy and Alex was unbelievable to begin with. I just found the book to be very contrived. The book is not bad, just not her best."
4,It is not a new book,"One should not present an old book, reedited like new one,plus it is not the best of this author.I almost bought it twice, as it was presented as her latest,and I like how she writes,"
2,Very dated plot.,"This book seemed VERY dated to me. I know it was supposedly copyrighted in 1996, but I strongly suspect it was written in the 80s. It contained no modern references (no computers, cell phones, Internet). At one point Daisy hopes the property Alex is taking her to is a large ranch like in the TV show ""Dallas."" The circus crew don't live in RVs, they live in ""Airstream trailers."" Daisy is actually excited by the prospect that Alex might be a descendant of Czar Nicholas I, a subject that was all the rage a couple of decades ago. Add to that the verbally abusive, autocratic father who sells his wide-eyed innocent daughter to the brooding, emotionally distant stranger, and you have a very Harlequin Romance-esque book. As a result, this book comes off as cliched, contrived and, therefore, not the least bit interesting."
5,Satisfaction Guaranteed,"Welcome to the world of Circus, as Alex Markov takes his new bride, Daisy Devreaux, to live their new life. Oh, not that Daisy choose this new life. Oh, no, she is forced to marry this handsome man or she goes to jail. What can she do anyway? But Alex has a plan for his spoiled bride...a plan that backfires when he realized that Daisy is not only having an angel face but also an angel heart...The world of circus kinda amazes me. I liked circus myself, especially the trapeze perfomances. And I found myself liking this book sooo much. SEP has done it again. You'll laugh with the characters, share the pain with them, and in the end find the triumph of love..."
1,Cliched and Totally Unrealistic,"I am not an avid romance reader, but I was willing to keep an open mind since it was rated so highly on Amazon and recommended by a friend. I was actually shocked at how contrived and unnatural the events in the story were and there was a ""preachy"" animal rights element that I didn't really appreciate (is it ever really a good idea to keep live tigers loose around people?). I didn't have any sympathy for any of the main characters and the secondary characters were simply flat. I kept reading with a hope that the book would get better. Unfortunately, the plot remained predictable to the end.Kiss an Angel"
3,Oldie,"An odd quality movie, definately made me relive the era, and since I enjoy Melanie Mayrons work and missed the original release of this movie I enjoyed seeing it."
4,Perfect temp!,Ordered this as a temporary replacement for my actual engagement ring and to wear when I'm out hiking and doing other stuff where losing my ring would not be cool. It's perfect and the price is perfect. Most people don't even know that it's not the real thing.
4,If you liked The Jessica Project.....,"If you liked Thomas Farrell's ""The Jessica Project"", you'll like his follow-up ""Skylord."" Unlike his previous book which had a gender-bending twist, this one's just a straight-out thriller. If you're a fan of Robert Ludlum or Tom Clancy you'll especially appreciate the cloak and dagger situations and those infamous drug lords."
3,Uneven selection of science essays,"I agree with other 3 star reviews, the selections are becoming dated but some like the Easter Island story,remain important. Popular science articles fail to use any of the techniques in the science literature. There are no abstracts,no defined conclusions, no graphs,tables or illustrations and no editing for brevity."
3,"Fair collection, but not enough meat","I've been reading these collections for the past few years. I felt that this collection concentrated too much on the political issues surrounding science for my tastes. I preferred earlier collections with more detail and content on both current science discoveries and historical context. While I do not disagree with the points of the essays, I didn't feel they added much to the debates at hand."
3,Good music. Poor engineering?,"As much as I like listening to the music on this CD, i always hear a very clear 'clipping' sound or similar recording distortion, that makes for a buzz-killer. As a result, this one is currently sitting on the shelf.It's not my equipment.It could be my individual CD.I suspect is the result of poor engineering with too much boosting and the accompanying compensatory compression."
2,sorry i disagree,"with the above review -I found this recording boring, dull with CAballe again too concerned about making beautiful sounds with no respect for the drama that Donizettis opera contains,her phrasing is poor and some top notes are shrill-(she comes a little undone in her effort to show us all how bloody marvellous she is), it is a vain although some times beautiful performance. If you adore her, then you'll love this - but should you want a more dramatic approach - steer clear. All the supporting roles are fine - but there is just no feeling to this at all - La Borgia should have a little bit of character no?"
5,Fricking awsome,What a great tripod accessory. It adds a bit of weight but not to much. This head can support plenty of weight.The locking feature is fast and convenient. The pistol grip makes adjustments a snap and the rotating collar for verticals is the best I've seen. Worth every penny!
5,CHRISTMAS WITH MARIO LANZA,"THIS ALBUM IS EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT! ALL THE REVIEWS ARE CORRECT. THEY ARE ALSO VERY TOUCHING. I AM 62 YEARS OLD/YOUNG. OUR TRADITION( IN WEST PHILA.) WAS TO PLAY THE OLD 78 RPM, HARD VINYL MARIO LANZA ALBUM WHILE GOING TO BED. WE WOULD TAKE A LITTLE NAP BEFORE SERVING CHRISTMAS MIDNIGHT MASS IN A CATHEDRAL-LIKE CHURCH. I WAS ALWAYS ENTRANCED WITH ' GUARDIAN ANGELS' AND THE ' THREE WISE MEN'. MY MOTHER LOVED THIS ALBUM. MARIO LANZA LIVED IN SOUTH PHILA. FOR AWHILE.I JUST WISH MY MOTHER COULD HEAR THE SOUND REPRODUCTION OF THIS NEW CD. KEEP SINGING MARIO! I KNOW HE IS IN GOD'S PERSONAL CHOIR...SAM STUBBS, ASHEVILLE ,NC...."
5,Dark Comedy with Great Performance by Michael Caine,"Hard to believe Michael Caine had to do ""Jaws 4: The Revenge,"" because he kicks ass in this blockbuster still-socially-relevant 60's classic. A great snapshot of period London, right down to the great musical soundtrack and costumes. Most modern audiences should still find it affecting and effective, although the ""talking to camera"" gimmick has been overused and abused in the 4 decades since this was made.Shelley Winters gives a very good, surprisingly understated supporting performance...as do all the female players.Too bad the DVD doesn't feature a Caine commentary track. That would be great!See if you can guess who sings the famous theme song in this movie version...it ain't Dionne Warwick! You'll love it..."
1,"Nope, dunno what's it's all about, Alfie.","Out on that all-too-familiar limb again: Took ""Alfie"" out of the library; I've heard of this movie, and that its hero was something of a bounder. Sorry chaps, really DIDN'T like it! Yes, I know he's supposed to be shallow, that that's the whole point, but it's just too depressing for me. At one point, I lost conciousness in front of the screen. When I came back, I asked myself, ""Do I really want to go on with this?"" And the answer was a resounding No. As you'll read, every other person just loved it; maybe you'll find you're more in tune with them. I'd rather see something a LITTLE more uplifting."
3,Unico in the Island of Magic,"I own the 1st movie, The Fantastic Adventures of Unico & found it to be a really cute movie. This is the 2nd movie & though it's a little long, I still found it cute. It's funny how many movies from the 80's that i still remember."
5,Unico,"Wow, I can't believe I finally found this video, I haven't seen it since I was about 6 years old. I LOVED this movie, well both of the Unico movies, when I was little. I'm so happy to have found it again. What a great story line and wonderful animation."
5,Unico is the Cutest!,"When I was around 6 years old, my mom would take us to Blockbuster once a month to rent a movie. Needless to say, I picked Unico in the Island of Magic almost every time. I LOVE IT SO MUCH! I have wanted to own it so bad, but sadly, I have not been able to find it anywhere for buying!"
3,The first Unico was better.,I don't know I didn't really like this one as much as the first one. The first one was more heart warming.
3,Minor skips,"I love this movie and so do my kids. I was a little disappointed that there are some places where the movie stops for a few seconds. I've bought another Unico movie without this problem, so it might have been my particular copy. Lord Kuruku is such a tragic character and its sad how Unico always has to go away. The living puppets are just as creepy now as they were back when I first saw it. It brings back good memories to watch it with my kids the way my grandma watched it with me."
2,"Great idea, disappointing outcome","I loved the idea of having this to water my plants on the deck and front porch without making several trips with the watering can. It worked well for about 2 times, then the plastic connector would not fit on the faucet again. It kept popping off."
1,jimmie,"The fitting that connects to the water supply is made of plastic and it leaks. It is easy to overtighten and strip the threads, therefore there's really not a way to stop the leak. The whole set isn't really useable."
1,Don't waste your $$ !!,"First there is no way to control pressure, water either dribbles out or shoots out so hard that it splashes mud all over the room. 2nd, by the third time I tried to use it, the threads stripped and it sprayed water all over the house. DEFINITELY NOT worth the $30 and aggrivation it cost me!!!!!"
4,Works Well!!,I bought this hose about a year ago and it has worked well for me. I have many plants both on outside porches and in my house. So I am able to connect to my kitchen sink and water all my plants with little effort. I also use to add water to my fish tank weekly. The hose is so long I can actually water a hanging plant on my outside steps.It does tend to tangle alot so I leave it drapped down to avoid the tangles. And I did get a small pin hole on the top of the hose but just put duck tape on it and good as new.Would recommend!!
3,"Works well, once you get it connected...","Once you get the SpringJet connected to your faucet, it works fine. The challenge is connecting it to your faucet. And, you face these challenges each time you use it!First, you connect the plastic adapter to the faucet, and you must be careful to avoid damaging it by cross-threading it. Second, you must tighten all the connections enough to avoid leaks. This requires quite a bit of tightening to accomplish. Third, even when you've tightened it enough to stop the leaks, the water pressure will sometimes pop the hose from connector, spraying water everywhere. And, it's difficult to re-assemble.You'll get used to the assembly process after you use it a few times, but better instructions would have shortened the learning process."
1,Molded plastic on plastic connections are not water tight.,"Don't waste your money. Not only did the fitting leak at the faucet connection, when any water pressure was applied water leaked from the handle and every other connection. Had to return the product because it could not be used for its intended function. The carpet was soaked instead of watering the plants!"
1,A REAL PIECE OF GARBAGE,"Purchased this on-line with good intentions. Was sincerely disappointed with it. First,the length is not what it is described,it stretches to 23feet,the spray nozzel does not spray no matter how you turn it,just shoots a harsh stream of water which throws dirt all over,and thirdly, the sink adapter which screws into the hose, the threads are tooooo short and it keeps popping off the sink when turned on creating another disaster with water all over.FORGET THIS ONE OUT THERE,there was a better one with brass water wand and brass coupling for a few $$ more. Can't find in now. Let me know if you see it!!!!"
1,Stay away from this toy,"No offense Amazon, but this is junk. Looks nice until the hose sees water pressure. The cheap coupling (to faucet) flexes and blows right off. No matter how little you have the spigot open..Additionally, the inlet is a very small hose (reduce pressure to the tip, increase pressure at the spigot? go figure)..... poor design.Returning as soon as I can get it in the box.Like the Haunted Forest said, "" I go back If I were you"""
3,"Very nice soundtrack, missing some good songs from the original film","I concur with most of the reviewers below, except that Love's much less well-known ""Alone Again Or"" should also have been included. Maybe they could have left off the two more hackneyed Jefferson Airplane tunes (""White Rabbit"" and ""Somebody to Love"") if space was tight. It's a nice mix of Moroccan music and 70s rock that re-creates the crazy innocence of the search for spiritual truth abroad."
4,Very Good,"I agree with Jennifer. I would of given it 5 stars, but no ""Horse With No Name"" by America. It was in the movie, but the rest I loved, especially ""Here comes the Sun"" and the two by Jefferson Airplane and the rest of the songs."
5,The eighth deadly sin - to allow this terrific recording to go out of print!,"The recording world's greatest deadly sin!Anna Moffo's Lucia di Lammermoor is truly unsurpassed.Not surpassed by Joan Sutherland (Moffo first sung this earlier than Dame Joan), not surpassed in the 20th century, not yet surpassed in the 21st.Carlo Bergonzi's Edgardo is similarly memorable; the supporting cast is truly great; Sereni made a horrific Enrico."
5,Loved having it,"We've traveled to Alaska more than once, and both times enjoyed having this guide book along to help identify birds, especially those not seen in the lower 48 states.From sooty shearwaters and bald eagles to horned and tufted puffins, one can find all sorts of sea and birds of prey here, as well as wood and grassland birds.A wonderful source to carry along and help identify species one has previously never seen."
1,This is not a toy!,"None of the questions above relate to this product, so . . .This grate was damaged when we received it, one of the legs and part of a corner were broken off. So, to be fair, it never had a chance to work properly, but we used it anyway because we didn't have anything else. This this is a mess, other parts have since broken off and it has been just about useless to us. (The company did handle it well when it arrived broken, they credited us, so that's why we never returned it.)"
5,Fantastic book,"This is book is great for beginners, want to learn to draw manga? Then this book should be high (if not on top) of your need-to-buy resources. Trust me its well worth it, vehicles, characters and mecha are great for beginners. You may however need another book for characters as this one keeps it basic but still its worth your money and more!The author goes into drawing characters, panels in comic books. Furthermore he tells you how to draw mecha and vehicles (meaning spaceships, aircraft and cars. Altough the sections may not be so well depth as in other books it is more complete seeing as the author combined al of these different subject as where other books tend to stick to one subject as mecha or chracter design.What are you waiting for? Buy it!"
2,Doesn't look same,"I purchased this item for my five year old daughter for Christmas. It was a very faint pink, the detailing did not look the same as online. The item I received seemed in poor quality. I have requested a replacement; shall see what it looks like."
1,23 inch acoustic guitar,"I bought this guitar for my grandson so that he and his grandpa could play their guitars together and it was a huge disappointment. I took it out of the box and had to tighten the strings, one of which broke immediately. There was no way to keep the strings tight, therefore, no way to play the guitar. There was no ""e-book"" or instructions on how to get it. The ""mini guitar"" was a small magnet. The shipping cost as much as the toy. I realize that this was only a toy, but most toys last longer than 5 minutes. This is not a good buy."
4,Light weight and appropriate size of monitor,"Machine is good but the description in Amazon was not so.I was trying to know if the machine has one 512 RAM or two 256 RAMs. But I could not find any relevant info. So, I just assumed that it might have the same RAM configuration as those in the other markets (bestbuy, etc), which had one 512 RAM. I bought one planning add one 512 RAM to make the total 1G.But when I got the machine I found it had two 256 RAMs so that I took one of them out and put 1G RAM instead.Sun"
5,Good tripod,Bought this for photography and as base for an easel. It works well for my DSLR and has worked outstandingly as a base for my painting easel. Very steady and the ball head is a solid performer. Recommended.
5,Works perfectly,Many of the new Dell laptops we are buying come with a HMDI port on them. Our conference rooms have VGA or HDMI available. This adaptor allows our staff to easily hook their laptops up to the DVI port on the projector.Nice quality look and feel to it. Very well constructed. The 'just work' out of the box. No problems with 15 or more laptops so far.
4,another good book,at first it was hard for me to get in this story but after a 4th to half of the book it got better and I could not put it down. this book goes good with the new book MOON and the Anazazi triogy books.
3,Chance To Die,"This book is sometimes interesting, but I found this version dull and a little bit overwhelming, lots of pages to turn. I suggest the books written by others work this is overkill."
5,My Favorite,"This is one of my favorite books. Probably one of the best that you will find in biographies of Amy Carmichael. This book has greatly impacted me and I return to it as a source of encouragement very often. Amma (indian for mother) had a passionate love for Jesus and her sole desire was to give Him her life. Mrs. Elliot shares very well of the path this desire brought her on, and the thousands of people whose lives were forever changed by it. Miss Carmichael has become one of my favorite authors as well. Praise the Lord! I hope you enjoy!"
3,"Interesting Woman, book a bit dry for me.","I'm a bit hesitant to speak negatively about this book due to the 'saintlike' nature of Elisabeth Elliot, as well as the many other postive reviews, but I struggled through reading it, and found it a bit 'dry'. I was anticipating reading it, and read christian fiction and nonfiction frequently, but was disappointed by this one."
4,Dedication!,"It is her life story and I really enjoyed it, it was written so that it was easy to understand and not too drawn out."
3,"Pretty, but ...","No way are they real emeralds. They're absolutely clear and flawless, which you just don't get for this sort of price.I would have preferred the post to be centered rather than at the top of the earring. When they're not centered, the earring rotates on the earlobe and looks odd when they don't match on both ears."
3,A disappointment.,"This CD coontains two songs, one the original on the album and another an extra thrown in. Absolutego, the song, is a let down, to say the least.Where as Sleep's Dopesmoker keeps you interested for the entire duration, Absolutego is a fifteen minute song sandwiched between 25 minutes of feedback. Dont get me wrong, I love Earth, SunnO))) and whatever drone band you can think of, but this isnt done as well as these bands.The bonus track is excellent drone, though. So if you have a lot of patience and enjoy the aformentioned bands, go for it.Id like to note that the production, even after being remastered, still isnt as good as it could be."
3,LOL a DR2 recording. Worse than Death Magnetic.,I like Boris. This album has some pretty cool stuff if you are into amplifier drones and heavily ****ed up tones. But good god this is the some of the loudest **** ever put to tape. Almost every album they have is mastered so badly as to be not listenable.Whatever I guess. I'm not paying for it though. They sound great live.
2,Disappointing,"I am no expert, and I have never read another book on palmistry.But this book is not the best place to learn from. Its not a lot of material or examples. Something basic as to whether(or what the difference is between those two) , to read the left or the right hand seems to have been left out.Also a section the history of hand reading or that of how the hand is constructed, seems unnecessary.I regret making this purchase."
1,comes with no instructions on how to use,I have tried to use this item and so far it was not worth the time and money I have spent with it. I still cannot open up a film container.
2,Poor,"I understand how some AS children would relate; however mine did not. She was horrified at the thought of being viewed as ""not normal"". Also the way the father treated his son before the diagnosis and after was, quite frankly, nystifying to me. My daughter has many of the same quirks that Ben has (hand flapping, obseesions, etc) I would never and never have put her down or got angry over those quirks.The doctor tells the Dad that Asperger's is a ""problem in the brain."" I have always described it as a different way of thinking. At this point I wasn't reading this book to my daughter. I can not fathom how she would react to being told she has a problem in her brain.Once again, some children obviously felt connected to the story. We had the opposite experience."
2,I was somewhat disappointed with this book.,"I also decided to read this book before giving it to my son, and I'm glad that I didn't give it to him. First, the language is off (the author is Austrailian) and an American Aspie will not be comfortable reading these 'different words'. Second, I don't know any Aspie child who has such a 'understanding' friend. I was a little scared thinking that my child would want me to find this kid for him. It portrayed a relationship that just isn't real. A very dangerous thing for our children.I won't be giving this book to my son, and I really don't know why I still have it.Another reviewer suggested that this book might be useful for students. I would have to agree with that statement."
4,Good Read,"I enjoy Mary Jane Clark a lot and this book was no exception. I did think the killer's identity was a bit obvious, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book."
5,I Enjoyed Myth Hunters,"I had never heard of Myth Hunters, but picked up the book because it looked interesting. I am so glad I did because the story is really a great one. Christopher does an excellent job of making the reader feel right at home with the inclusion of ""mythical"" characters we first heard about as children. The book is a great read, and I am pre-ordering the second book due out this month. Myth Hunters has a new fan! If you enjoy reading fantasy novels, you should check this one out!"
5,Peter and the Wolf CD for children,This is an incredible classic presentation of Peter and the Wolf for children. My grandchildren ages 3 and 4 ask to hear this CD over and over. They know all the details of the story and recognize the characters by the musical instruments and themes as they are played. The narration is fabulous.
1,Too bad Richard Hale recording is not available.,"It is tragic that the recording of ""Peter and the Wolf"" with Fiedler, narrated by Richard Hale, the BEST narrator ever, is not available on CD. It was issued on vinyl in 1957."
3,Also Ran Songs,"This CD collects some of the great top 40 tunes of the 50s, 60's. Yet it also has some also rans. You have to pick and choice your favorite songs. It has enough good music to warrant purchase."
2,Worked fine for about 3 years,I've owned two AU5ES FloodAlert sump pump controllers. Purchased first one in 2006 through Amazon. Bought the second one in 2009 at ACE Hardware store after the first one failed. That one failed in 2011. I've had better results using float switches that come with the pumps so I'm not buying another FloodAlert. Really too bad because it seems like a great product concept and it did work - even the audible high water alarm function - for a couple years. I disassembled the both failed units and saw no obvious problems (like burned out relay mentioned in another review). Did notice some corrosion on battery terminals but not enough to prevent it from working.
5,Sublime is the only C.D's where i could listen to every song,"They have the best beat, Bradley was the best artist in his field and there music comes alive, like,""Date Rape,""""Scarlet Bogonia's,""""Smoke two Joints. PHATEST group in the world."
4,Different Than Self Titled,"This album has a very different vibe than their breakthrough self-titled album Sublime. 40 oz. to Freedom has more of a dub and reggae influnce than what is heard on Sublime. The punk and hip-hop elements are still there, but aren't as prominent. The majority of this album is not as fast paced as the selections on the Sublime album. While this album is still an excellent buy, I just don't dig it as much because of its slower pace, and less emphasis in punk rock."
5,JUST BUY IT DUMBASS,5 STAR AVERAGE RATING? YOU DO THE MATH. I PLAYED THIS CD SO MANY TIMES IT WORE OUT!
5,A Must Have,"Sublime is one of the few bands that is (was) able to break down the barriers between genres and reach people that less diverse artists will never be able to. If this CD is not in your collection, you are missing out!"
5,Sublime -------> 40 oz. to freedom,"this is the best album Sublime ever put out. If you are into ska/reggae, i definately reccomend that you buy this CD if it is not already in your collection. It will be one of the best investments you will ever make. END"
5,Simply The Best Album of the Decade,"The title says it all. Unlike their other albums, 40 oz. forcefully mixes in Punk Reggae and Ska to make a truly great collection of songs. This Album is truly a thing of beauty not to be denied to the ages"
3,"TBL IS ALL THE RAGE, BUT....","Like almost all of Ellis's books, this book is a very good representation and summary of much of the pertinent research up to the time of the book's publication (2003) on the now-all-important concept of 'task-based learning'. The problem in the plan, though, is most likely that TBL will be old news and not really provide definitive solutions to real-world teaching and language learning. Second Language Acquisition is very good at breaking down learning into chunks for academic analysis, but it is very weak at putting the poor Humpty Dumpty of real language teaching back together. And why shouldn't it be weak? It isn't like most people who are professional SLAers actually have to teach a full course load or write syllabues and tests for those courses.This will be inescapable reading for those in grad. school, and will collect dust on the shelves of the teachers after grad. school."
5,everyone shoukd check this out,This is the most valuable resource for bass you are ever likely to find. I love it. A class act. Keep this music living.
3,All excitement and no substance,"Be careful about buying this book if you are working on a start-up. Although it is well written and edited, it contains very little useful information for someone on the verge of writing a business plan or presentation for a start-up. In all fairness, she does comment that if you have a good idea, a good market, and a team, then you do not need this book. Risk is acceptable in one of those three areas, but this book is really meant for those seeking funding with risk in two or more areas, i.e. if you need a lot of analysis and complexity in your plan, then this book may help."
2,All favorable reviews written by publishers agents,"The book is mediocre at best and contains very little insightful beyond what common sense would tell you or what is avaiable for free on the web.If you read the five star reviews carefully you can tell by the way they are worded that they have been likely crafted by press agents, note both language and anonymity. It would be very disappointing to find that someone would work so little on writing a decent book and so much on trying to cheat to get ahead."
1,This Book is beyond useless,Your better off buying a blank book. A waste of time and money. Nothing an average business person doest already know...
1,Title is deceptive. Reader's-Digest level reading.,"Contrary to the sub-title of the book, Chandler only gives a glossy, Reader's Digest level, birds eye view of what to when approaching prospective investors, understanding the risks of funding your business, looking for investors, and building a credible business plan.She does not really address how not to lose control of your company, project, or idea, alluded to in the sub-title, so beware. This is why I rate it 1 star. If it weren't for this, I would give it a three star rating."
4,"Good starter HDTV, great picture.","Great picture when hooked up to an LG HD tuner through the DVI port. DVDs look good, but even better with an external player hooked up to the component video port. This even works with my HD DVD player. Overall, among the best HD pictures I have seen, and better than many other flat panels costing far more. A good combo is to use this TV with LGs 3510 HD tuner/DVD combo, which can hook up to the DVI port. You can find HD tuners or the 3510 on eBay."
4,K is for Kwanzaa--Great Book,"Ford managed to teach about the Kwanzaa in an interesting way to children, and was not stereotypical. This is a great book to teach cultural diversity in the classroom, because it does not belittle any race or culture. Read it, and you'll see!!"
4,Excellent album - not boring at all,"This is the ""Wise Guy"" album as was released in the UK in its original form, plus a few club remixes. Not a bad bargain for some excellent tracks. Of the entire album, about 75% is excellent, the rest is filler with a good beat."
2,could have been good,"The best part of this movie is Captain Nemo (well portrayed by Patrick Stewart) and his cool steampunk house. Unfortunately, that's not quite enough to balance out the ridiculous scripting, the barely passable special effects, and one highly annoying Southerner. Kyle MacLachlan makes a great protagonist. He reminds me of Dale Midkiff in the Love Comes Softly series. Too bad they messed this up."
3,stupid first baseman,NY Mets first baseman is the most stupid fielder I have ever seen in my whole life............
5,great!,"very cool, top quality video and then some! the footage, narration, dialogue of guests, graphics and effects, are ALL 100% top notch."
3,not exactly hate,"nurse norma theale is hired to be a nurse/companion to bossy madame thibault. the thibault family are very rich and run an art gallery in new york city.norma is accepted by all the family members as one of their' own. norma is very attracted to the son,nicolas,who is a talented musician. nicolas has deep resentment towards his mother,whom he thinks is controlling him.norma finds herself falling in love with nicolas,despite his uncontrollable temper. suddenly,someone is trying to put madame thibault's life in danger! who is it? nicolas? or someone else?i am puzzled by the book title. it was more like,the house of ""hostility"" rather than,hate. an ""ok"" story-that is all."
4,Happy Fun Goodtime Sounds,"An excellent follow-up to Trip Tease, and very similiar...Tipsy could release hundreds of hours of music just like this and it would continue to entertain from start to finish. One reviewer stated that one shortcoming was the brevity of the tracks, and that's a valid point - you really do wish the tune would just keep on going, although you can kinda sit back, relax and listen to the entire disc as if it were one continuous tune (albeit with the occasional break). Overall, lots of fun - I hope they don't wait years to release aother disc!"
2,"Uh-oh, indeed","Well, maybe I'm one to disagree with the rest of reviewers here but unfortunately this Tipsy's new album hasn't attracted me like their first LP, ""Trip Tease"". On that first album, there is a lot of spontaneity, daring and playful attitude that I just don't see it coming on this album. Well, the weird sounds and retro samples abound on this new record as well, but they somewhat lack that energy and playful attitude of their first album, sounding a lot more somber and inexpressive than we'd expect from Tipsy. Sorry guys, nice try, better luck next time."
1,Avoid it like a cold,I had to buy it for an engineering math course. It is truly aweful. It has proof after proof and theorem after theorem with very few examples. Very abstract explanations. I do not know if anyone could learn anything from this book except to buy a different book if you really want to learn linear algebra. I just purchased a different Linear algebra book so I can understand the material. Take the advice of someone who has used the text and do your self a favor. Do not buy this book not even as a joke.
2,Bud & Travis Latin Album,"I had this album in vinyl from the 60's, loved it, about wore it out.The CD is a dreadful sound mix. Sounds like Bud & Travis are on two different planets."
5,OUTSTANDING,"As I was reading the powerful poetry of Treasured MisfortunesI became to value the real meaning of sincere love between a mother and her child.I was very educated. The book was full of many emotional issues,that are very deep and sacred to the poet soul. I enjoyed the book very much,as well as appreciated Amazon .com for it's great way in allowing me to express my thoughts. I am actually waiting to read more of her books, She is just an outstanding lady of great talent and wise expressions that are very healing."
5,A life saver,"My wife was pregnant and considering to have an abortion,i was against her having an abortion.By GOD blessings she saw and read some of the book Treasured Misfortunes.She came home with a smile indicating to me that she no longer wishes to have an abortion.She explained herself to me,and when i realized that Sammer's poetry book was the reason of her changing her mind,i strongly insisted that i must read the book and encourage everyone to allow their hearts and spirits to be touched by its blessings.It is a great book.It saved my baby life.Thanks much."
4,DESTINY'S CHILD (vs.) EN VOGUE = EQUAL JUST DIFFERENT DECADES,IF YOU LOVE DESTINY'S CHILD.THEN YOU WILL LOVE EN VOGUE.THEY HAVE THE SONG'S TO DANCE TO.THEY HAVE THE SLOW~JAM'S TO GET ROMANTIC TO.BUT IN DESTINY'S CHILD BEYONCE STEAL'S THE SHOW.IN EN VOGUE YOU WILL LOVE ALL THE MEMBERS THE SAME.AND IN THE EARLY 90'S THEY WERE A HIT MAKEING MACHINE.SO PICK THIS CD UP AND CHECK OUT THE 90'S AT IT'S FINEST{EN VOGUE}.THE ULTIMATE GIRL/WOMEN GROUP OF THE DECADE PAST.[OLD-SCHOOL IS THE BEST SCHOOL IN MUSIC]{THE SLOW~JAM MASTER} NEW YORK
2,It hasn't kicked in yet,"Well after readinh the other glowing reviews, it makes me wanna go back and try again. Cuz upon the first few listens I couldn't get past track 4, the lack of song structure and melody was annoying. Don't get me wrong I LOVED the debut but maybe they should have held off going all Bacharach on us in structure til the ""difficult third album""Ok off I go to give it another shot cuz I really wanna like this CD!"
3,I dont get this one...,This is not a bad CD persay ..i feel their music is not defined well..the woman's voice is way for shrill to my taste and is pretty hard to listen to. After about 10 minutes into the CD all the songs sound the same to me. The only reason this one gets 3 stars and not one is because there is one instrumental track that really kicks ass. They are signed to Massive Attacks lable so there may be something that i am missing.
3,It's Ok.......,"there are a few good songs on it, but I'm glad I have it in my collection anyway.........."
5,Fantastic Science!,"Sould be required reading by all, but particularly, expecting parents (prior to conception).Solid science for the health of the future!!"
2,This book is not what it says it is,"I have always had an enormous interest in Genetics and was thrilled when I had the opprotunity to read this book. At the beginning of the book Dr. Lipton delves into academic research and then tries to challenge biology by saying ""genes and DNA do not control our biology; that instead DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell"". Which I failed to fully understand as that concept was the basis for Darwin's Orgin of the Species. It's well known that biological lifeforms adapt to their evironment and the concept is not revolutionary.Sadly, Dr. Lipton's jump into New Age healing concepts prevented me from confirming that 'signals from outside a cell controls it's biology' was the basis for the book. This book was a complete disappointment but may be appriciated by those have an interest in the New Age Ideals."
3,"Good start, but ...","""The Biology of Belief"" is a good start and can make for some interesting reading, but as so many people have stated, it really doesn't give you techniques for changing your beliefs. That's why I recommend ""Anatomy of Success"" by Ronald A. Kaufman. Many chapters are dedicated to beliefs with real world examples, as well as how beliefs are formed through our experiences. He then gives you a multiple-step process and methods for how to change your beliefs. Beliefs do change, and this is the way it happens. Either we manage our beliefs, or they manage us."
1,Truly Amazing anyone believes this tripe,"Lipton is apparently gunning to be the next L. Ron Hubbard, with ""PSYCH-K"" replacing Scientology. Want to solve all life's problems with nothing more than a little positive thought? No Problem! Just buy my book, and take my class."
2,Heh,"No mention of the ground-breaking work of Dr. Candace Pert?Oh yeah, and thanks for adding the Appendix which invites us to spend more money on your friend's program. I believe you could have explained your technique to the reader. Or, maybe it doesen't work. After hearing you SO excited and stimulating about your ideas on a certain well-known radio talk show program, I expected more from you than this. Your book is a disappoinment."
1,hookum,"This book is not science.It is a matter of belief, and unsupported by facts.It belongs in religion and spirituality not science.A lot of books tout amazing breakthroughs by isolated so-calledscientists which fly in the face of known facts and solidevidence of thousands of real scientists. How can these isolatedindividuals do the miraculous and stand conventional scienceon its head with these amazing break throughs? Well they don't.They write about it, but it is not true. A lots of peoplefall for it. Don't be one of them."
3,Not quite what I expected.,"I have the audio book. There are 3 CD's, the first one ""lost"" me. Too much technical detail, for me anyway. The third CD was easier to understand and made more sense. But it's true, he doesn't give many examples of excercises in ways to ""change one's ways"". It sounded too much like a university professor lecture, one who makes assumptions on what you should already know."
3,Not Sure,"I bought this book because it was recommended by Wayne Dyer.It was very informative but seemed to be a little too scientific for long stretches for me. It's written for ""laymen"" but I think some parts could have been simplified. I DID enjoy the ""Butter/olive/pimento sandwich"" example and now understand a lot about cell membranes. I agree it's environment.I did NOT enjoy references to ""psych-k"". It's like one book leading into and selling another book. I've checked out the website and it's all marketing. ENOUGH ALREADY"
1,Terrible Misrepresentation of Science,"Show this book to any other molecular biologist, and they will find it laughable. They will easily be able to point out the many distortions and manipulations of science throughout the book.The author presents himself as having great insight into human biology when in reality, he's just taking credit for well known, scientific discoveries and then twisting them to fit his theories.Sadly, this book does very little to add to the knowledge and understanding of the mind body connection. For more information on this subject I would recommend authors like Andrew Weil or Daniel Amen.In my opinion, authors like this one only deter from our having a better understanding of the effect that biology and psychology have on each other."
5,"It's the environment, stupid!","'The Biology of Belief' will change the way you look at your body and its abilities, particularly your ability to heal. You have the power to heal yourself on every level; it begins with how you see yourself and your ability to heal. ""It's the environment, stupid!"" is one of the many wonderful phrases in this book, meaning, in this case, that the environment we have within us determines what we physically become.This book is a game changer. Highly recommended!"
5,Buy It,"Three levels of exercise are taught. The first level seemed a bit easy but it was a very good (and necessary) prep for second level.The third level can be achived with a little time and effort. The program is not complicated and can be easily followed working out a couple of times a week.Athletes as well as the deconditioned can use this well organized text and conditioning is focused on but not limited to ""the core""."
3,"Great pictures, a bit hard to follow exercises","I liked the author's explanations, and the tone of the book was great. The pictures were also well done.However I found it difficult to follow the exercise programs. There was a ""pre-workout"" section, and then a beginning workout. However I wasn't sure which workout I should be doing first.When I started doing the exercises, I wasn't sure if I was doing the exercises correctly. I didn't feel a stretch in some cases. Also I wasn't completely clear on the frequency or duration.In the end, I switched to a Core workout DVD, which I found much easier to follow."
2,Have you looked at this guy lately,I found this book interesting. Yet I question the validity of some of his advice. Have you looked at this guy lately. If I am looking for advice on better health I prefer it from someone who can either follow his own advice or show that by following his advice one can be fit.With his weight and carriage he clearly should be in a different line of work.
2,Not what I thought it would be.,"Very basic. I don't mind basic when I need basic. I got this book to get something more. I wanted to learn about healthy living. Judging from some reviews I thought this would be a good book for it.(For basic information on natural healing I've got: ""God's Medicine Is Best"" by Linda Wise, and I am very happy with it.)"
5,Down-to-earth advice,"In this book, Dr. Weil provides real, down-to-earth advice for people interested in good nutrition and health. He dosn't propagate crazy diet-schemes such as eating bagels, or total avoidance of carbohydrates, but instead, advocates moderation (something to practice in all aspects of life, not just eating). A comparison is made between disease trends of the past and present, as well as diets and trends in other countries, and hypotheses are made about how the advent of modern food processing may be responsible for the increased trends of disease we're cuttently experiencing. Also discussed are herbal tonics, remedies, etc. from other cultures around the globe. Areas where information is preliminary, or warrants further study, are duely noted."
3,"OK, but there are better guidebooks out there","On a recent trip to costa rica, I had two guide books, and this one was lacking in comparison. I purchased this book, but then later ended up buying the new addition of Lonely Planet as well, as the rough guide simply did not have as much information. For most towns, they did not have as many accomodation listings as LP, and there were many smaller towns rough guide did not cover at all. I also found their maps not as easy to use. Overall, I would say this book is adequate, but that LP gives you a lot more info."
3,Classroom Instruction That Works,Classroom Instruction That Works: Research-Based Strategies for Increasing Student Achievement [CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION THAT] Great book! Very useful!
4,Excellent Read,"I felt the book was an excellent read. I liked the way it segmented and summarized the classroom instruction methods. However, I did feel at times it went too deep into the research portion, when a nice short summary would have done the job. Also thought the charts used to document research findings could have been displayed better. Overall, as a non-teacher pursuing a teaching degree, it brought me up to speed on classroom instruction strategies."
4,A Decent Presentation Of Various Modern Blues Piano Styles,"This book is the companion to LFTL: Rock Keyboards. Again, there are some nice bios and pictures of the featured keyboardists, with their personal tips quoted in the side bars. The book also has a decent introductory chapter on basic music theory, and blues scales and their fingerings are given on the last page. The guts of the book are the sixty or so transcribed and recorded licks. Each lick is referenced to a page in the book via an introductory voice over. The fingering is provided on selected licks. Most the licks are generally four bars long and played only once on the CD. However, this time the book includes one or two full 12 bar songs in the style on each artist. Learning an entire song is more enjoyable than just amassing a repertoire of licks. This book is for intermediate to advanced players and is a cut above LFTL: Rock Keyboards."
4,A Good Book,I thought it was a good book. It is very similar to what it is like in high school today. The differences between us by our looks make us feel that that person is bad or that person is strange. It really follows life like today. I would recommend this book to others because it really makes you think about what you are doing to others or thinking about others by the way that you see them as and you can be friends with people that you may never even consider to acknowledge.
2,"Trite characters, predictable plot","As a reader of Young Adult fiction, I always cheer when an author puts together a book that gives credit to the intelligence of the average teen. Unfortunately, I could find little here to cheer for.Overdrawn character stereotypes, unbelievable events, and a predictable plot all combine to make this work a mild insult to the intelligence of young adult readers.The basic ""Breakfast Club"" idea is sound, and it would be interesting to see this book completely rewritten with an eye towards fresher, more believable characters and plot events that aren't so hard to swallow."
2,not very durable,"I bought this toy for my 12 month old and she had fun with it for a week or so. The balls it comes with are loud, but that's what catches their attention. We also spun other balls and toys such as little people on the spinners. She lost interest in it for a few weeks and one day she used the toy as a ladder to get onto the couch. She would stand on the spinners and then the treetop. I caught her doing this about 3 times and now the spinners dont spin at all(not a battery problem). She's very petite and only weighs 18 lbs., So I was very surprised that she could do any damage to a fisher price toy. Even though I threw out the box, I'm returning this toy to Toys r Us. Since it is broken, I will be exchanging it for a completely different toy. Anyone can do this. I know because I worked there, in customer service, for 2.5 years. If they give you any problems, just ask to see the manager. Dont waste your money people."
2,Disappointed,"It looks so good on the package. Like the others have mentioned, this is a very noisy toy. I bought it for my 5 mos old and it stopped working within 2 days. He didn't even play much with it. I called FP customer service and they refunded my money without much fuss. I don't really recommend this toy. However, my son did seem to like the balls that came with it."
1,Would not recommend.,"Nice idea, but disappointed in the execution. When the plastic balls hit spinning disc area at the base the base spins very quickly and all you hear is a clattering sound. That sound is then multiplied the more balls you use (it comes with 4). The only way this toy is usable is when it is turned off and so the spinning base is deactivated. Would not recommend."
1,I dont like this toy at all.,I do not like this product at all. First of all its not worth the money spent. Its small for the price. The balls clanking together make it wayy to noisy to even hear the music. To top it off the things stopped spinning. I would recommend not getting this. Its not worth the money or time to put it together. But I contacted Fisher Price and they are sending a check.
3,loud loud toy,This is a very cute toy.. My son Loves it.. but it is very LOUD>>> you can turn the sound down but still if the baby puts all the balls on it it gets so load you can;t hear the soung... and you can;t adjust the sound of the balls... Other then that it is a cute toy my son loves...
3,not great but kids will love...,"all the negative stuff said about this toy are true. It is loud. The music is drowned out, and the spinning mechanishm breaks down easily. BUT....my daughter still loves watching the balls spin round and round....she thinks the toy is great. she also enjoys pushing the button without the balls actually on the spinner, so she can hear the music. I wouldn't necesarily highly recomend the toy, but i dont think your child will be diapointed if you pick it up."
4,a great birthday gift,"My son received this as a gift when he was 1. We were already familiar with the peek-a-boo round blocks so this just added to his fun. It is a little noisy, but that's why the off button was invented."
3,Not worth my money!,My 15 month old dd has has had this toy for about 5 months and it hardly gets played with. It is quite loud when all the balls are on it at once and it just gets old really fast. So if your baby isnt easily entertained this toy might not be worth it for you. She does like to play with the balls but i could have just bought those instead. So basically I think it is a pretty boring toy and I wouldn't probably buy it again unless it was like 10$ or less.
2,skin trouble...,"I never had any trouble with cosmetics before so I didn't expect Olay Definity UV Lotion to cause any...(especially, after I read many excellent reviews on the product) However, I noticed tiny pimples after applying some and my face felt itchy. I wish I could give it away to someone who likes and uses w/o trouble since I only used a few drops and it's sitting on my dressing table almost brand new..."
1,Boring!,I love these kind of movies. Saw it years ago on TV and forgot the name of the movie. So then I bought the DVD by mistake. It is just as boring as it was years ago! Save your money. What a waste of time and money for this one.
1,NOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM, THEY SENT ME THE WRONG ONE. CALLED, RETURNED AND WAS SENT THE WRONG ITEM AGAIN. THE ONE THEY HAVE IS NOT THE ONE SHOWN."
3,plastic skirt hangers,"Great product, but way too expensive shipping cost; it ended up the same as the hangers. The company definitely needs to find a cheaper way to ship this product."
2,Examples are enjoyable but plenty of obvious mistakes,"We are using it as our textbook for our Master course in Australia. Both the teacher and students found that the practical examples are very interesting. However, there are inconsistencies in the usage of exchange rate presentations. Some mathematical calculations and charts are obviously wrong. Mr Smithson, please spend more time to amend your book. Thanks."
1,Ever see someone throw up through their ears!?!?!?!?!?!?,"If you want to see the most amazing thing, listen to this album. The surprising event you will get is you will throw up from your ears. I thought we got rid of this clown with the last ridiculously wack album he put out. But just like a bad string of herpes he is back, polluting the airwaves with more immature, infantile, so called ""music"". Chingy is no lyricist and when the beat is actually decent he wastes it. This album is wack straight up and down. Chingy is not just a member of the beat waster club he is the president."
5,Why say this albums bad...,This Album is not bad >IN FACT< it is very good =] in my opinion! I think Chingy is a good Rapper and Hip Hop Star but the thing you people don't know is his music's not TECHNICALLY HIP HOP or RAP its more of Crunk or Crunk & B like lil jhon....any way i think for people who take a chance on listening to it MIGHT actually like it.
3,Pay attention to detail!,"Although I ordered this product, I didn't realize it was different than what I had bought previously in the store. Beware that this is a scented version without any SPF. In the store, I bought an unscented version with SPF 15. I thought I was buying the same thing here. They do sell the other version, if that's what you're looking for. I personally do not want something without SPF or with a scent. The scent isn't horrible though and it does go on smooth, like the other version. I really like the foaming moisturizer."
3,Olay,This product is okay....I don't see that it is any better than most similar products....many of which are less expensive
4,Live show NOT to be missed!,"Rockapella shines in this performance feature. Not a complete ""front to back"" performance as it is obvious that the order of the songs has been changed so the show will flow better on video. The ONLY thing that is lacking in this presentation is a sound mix in 5.1 surround, which is the only reason for the 4 star rating. Still, it remains the ""Blast!"" of a capella.I had the pleasure of hosting Rockapella for a concert in 1997 and I have to say that these guys are as great off stage as they are on. Of course, they loved my fajitas so their taste is impecable as well! A live show anywhere near you has to be a MUST SEE!"
5,Pastor Frank,Fresh Encounters: Experiencing Transformation through United Worship-Based Prayer is without a doubt the best book that I have ever read and has proved to be a wonderful tool in teaching a church how to pray. Dan henderson REALLY captures the essence of what Jesus intended His church to look like when they prayed. I Highly recommend this book to all who want to experience Jesus Christ through prayer!
5,Verdi's Aida,"Once again [...], classical radio in Seattle, brought this incredible recording to my attention. While it was done in 1955 it is far superior to a more recent recording that I have with Domingo in the tenor role.I was amazed that an unsophisticate, such as myself, could clearly tell the difference in the quality of the two performances. If you love opera, and Aida particularly, you'll want this version."
3,Rhonda's Rating of Humans,"The science fiction concept was a great hook. Very interesting details in the book for someone like me who studied science. The clear flaw in the writing was the direction in which the author went where God was concerned, not to mention his extremely shallow and inaccurate understanding of the Viet Nam War in the previous volume. Because the author obviously wanted to force his own belief system on his readers, he used a very obvious and immature writing style in delivering his value system. There was so much great material here...it is a shame it was ruined by such devices. I would have recommended this book to everyone I saw. Instead, I had to tell people when discussing what I was reading that, although interesting, I could not recommend the books."
3,A bridge from Hominids to Hybrids,"In this second book of The Neanderthal Parallax, Robert Sawyer continues his story about the meeting of Neanderthal and Homo sapien societies. Robert Sawyer explores much more of Neanderthal society, but his descriptions seem more of an idealized view of Earth and not much about what a Neanderthal society would really be like. But unlike the first book, Sawyer does bring up weaknesses in Neanderthal society. In addition he pontificated quite a bit about religion and war. Of the three books in the series, this was definitely the weakest, and it was worth reading because it linked the first book (Hominids) with the third (Hybrids) which was the strongest book of the series."
3,"wow, just wow","Just wow, I was looking forward to seeing this for some time, and finally popped it in. Gotta say this is one of the worst edge-enhanced dvds I've ever seen. People have a thick white line surrounding them in many scenes, faces (and places) are a contrasty mess oftentimes. Very disappointing. But all of that aside, I'd still just give it 3 stars (maybe 3.5 if I could) because I was also rather disappointed at how well this movie did not hold up to my vague recollection of it from many years ago. Kind of interesting, kind of not, it's not stood the test of time in my opinion.(Update: Interesting that only 1 of 7 people have found this review useful... anyway, for those who care about what their dvds look like, caveat emptor.)"
3,A good book to open the discussion of God with your child.,"This book is a great springboard for discussing the concept of God with your child. The subject of God is approached from a very general standpoint, making it appropriate reading for readers with a variety of religious backgrounds."
1,Had very little how to content,"This book had very little to no ""how to"" information. The drawings that you see on the website are about all that there is. Mostly a recollection of past experiences. Dissappointed..."
3,"Adventures from the Techno;ogy Underground: Catapults, Pulsejets, Rail Guns, Flamethrowers,Tesla Coils, Air Cannons, and the Gar","I did not like this book at all. It just was not what I expected. I found it very ""Verbose"" and way to boring. I wished I had not bought it."
5,"Top notch Tchaikovsky from Fiedler and the Boston Pops, 1963","Arthur Fiedler (1894-1979) made this recording of excerpts from ""Swan Lake"" with the Boston Pops Orchestra in 1963, and the sound is excellent. The playing of the Boston Pops (the Boston Symphony minus first chair players) is very fine: ensemble and intonation are A-1. Fiedler takes some fast, bracing tempos in some movements, such as the ""Czardas"", and it's really exciting.My only regret is that the playing time is only 47+ minutes. This is the type of disc you wish would go on longer than the actual playing time. But, that's what REPEAT buttons are for on CD and DVD players, right?This disc is a great bargain for both sound and playing, and I highly recommend it. I thoroughly enjoyed Fiedler's ""Swan Lake"", and I've heard other recordings of Swan Lake: excerpts by Ormandy/Philadelphia (Sony), Bernstein/New York (CBS), Abravanel/Utah (MCA), and the complete ballet by Bonynge/National Philharmonic (Decca)."
3,it does what it is supposed to.. sorta,"Ok the boards that came with this thing were a little warped or something because it was terribly off balance after assembly. It was rocking back and forth I had to ""adjust"" this puppy to get it to stay still. You could probably find alot better, but it does what it advertises i guess. You get what you pay for here."
5,; ),I'm very please with how fast the books were sent to me. I brought it two weeks ahead of the baby shower I was going to so I figure it might take a while for me to get it so it was great that I got it just in a few days like I was promise.
3,small,"Cute book, content what you expect of a child's prayer book. You can't tell how small it is though online. Think minibook, about the size of the palm of your hand. I was expecting a regular sized book."
5,Awesome!,I use this product in many of my projects and am never disapointed! It's smooth and bakes up great! Thanks!
4,My son loves to read this year round!,"It's July, and we're reading this book daily! My 16 mo. old son loves to pull this book off the shelf and have me read it to him. I wish that the last page read: ""I am Baby Jesus asleep in the hay and I am the reason for Christmas day"". But, other than that, it's a very cute book and my son loves it."
4,Christmas magic,This tiny book shows you the magic that is truly Christmas in a simple easy to read and see for the youngest to see the wonder of Christmas.
2,Not very enlightening,I bought this little book hoping that it would help me through some moments of doubt; but it didn't. It's too full of platitudes and nothing is new. I'd recommend reading the Bible instead.
5,The Versatility of Phil Collins,"I saw this video and saw another side of Phil Collins, actually ALL sides of Phil Collins, working in the round stage was a wonderful touch. He also featured not only his best but the feeling was very international. It crossed all boundries. That is why I want to buy it!"
2,Lacks Energy,"I have loved Phil's ""Seriously Live"" concert on vhs for years, and this dvd doesn't come close to it in either the music or the energy the band puts out on stage. This concert dvd is a major disappoint in comparison. I don't recommend it at all."
2,2 Stars,"Boring not to mention heavy handled psuedo-theological porn. Like reviewers before me said, the poetry was good but too much time was spent on raunchy grotesque sex scenes and less time spent on adding substance to the near invisible plotline."
3,It's OK,"I love the idea of the self-watering bulb and they look attractive in my plants. There are a couple of issues that i have with them, though. As many other reviewers have already stated, they get very easily clogged. If the tube gets dirt in it or if the globe isn't positioned at the correct angle, it stops watering. Also, if you have a bigger plant, you're going to need several of these, because bigger plants suck the water out of these in a day or less."
3,partial success,"I realize that the Osmatic process is supposed to be at work in this item but it seems to defeat itself as the neck seems to become plugged as it is inserted into the soil. Perhaps the fault is mine. Do I need further instruction in the insertion process? My experience with this is that I don't trust it to do what it is intended to do without daily attention on my part. What then, is the purpose of this purchase?Jack"
5,Good to know before buying,I am pleased by the secure artificial foam package that protects the aqua globes to arrive in one piece. What i did not know is that the soil of a plant has to be entire saturated with water for the aqua globe to work the way it's advertised. I recommend the seller ads it into the description for customers to read prior to ordering.Highly recommend both the seller and the product! Wishing that more colors were offered.
3,Good value for the price,This product is a good value for the price. The glass is good quality and looks very nice in your house plants.
5,Saved my poor plant!,"I have a plant at work that needs to be kept constantly moist. As I work from home often, my poor plant was suffering. Aqua globes have saved my plant's life! Also, my rep as a plant murderer."
2,Aqua Globe,The item seems fine and seemed to work well at first. When I has going to go on vacation and watered the plant and then filled and inserted Aqua Globe the filled globe was top heavy and the wet soil could not support the weight. The globe tipped over. Luckily I caught it. I'm now just using them for decorations and would not purchase anymore.
1,DOES NOT WORK!,"Aqua globes do not work! The end clogs when you push them into the soil and no water can get out to water the plant! Even making ""pre-holes"" with pencils, pens, fingers, etc...the end of the globe clogs when you put it into the soil then the water can't get out. I have left these in for as much as a week to see if it unclogs itself when the soil is dry and no, it does not. I have to take the globe out of the plant soil and unclog it with a pencil while running under water. These are pretty but they do not work and are a waste of money!"
4,Nice large Aqua Globes that work!,"Aqua globes work well when used properly! These larger bulbs work great in larger pots. Be sure to make a hole in the dirt and place the globe into it, do not poke a hole with the bulb or dirt will fill the stem. Used properly they work great!"
3,Look great but don't save time,"I received these for Christmas presents. They are very difficult to fill and waste a lot of water in the process. They must be refilled before completely empty or you have to dig dirt out of the fragile stem. They do add wonderful color for the plants in the window, but really are not a time saver or a water saver."
2,kinda greasy..eye makeup smears,Not really a fan of this product. I have used it for about a week now and haven't noticed any difference at all. It just seems kinda greasy and I noticed my eyeliner has been smearing ever since wearing it. Maybe I will just use this cream before bed and not during the day.
4,La Tienda Review,"I liked getting the 3 styles (Hot, sweet, biter/sweet)at once. If I use one more than the others, I will reorder individually. These really add a noticeable zip to the recipe, which I like. I have standard paprika for other subtle uses... I've used other smoked paprika and La Tienda is every bit as good. Expensive? yes; so if you're a canned spaghetti-o eater - save the extra $3/can, otherwise try some of this in your next baby-back rib rub!"
5,Unique Use,I used this product in the Theatre to hold wireless microphone transmitters. The product is worn under the costumes and provides a secure location for use. It has been exactly what I was looking for and it has proven very reliable on stage!
1,"anger, denial, and acceptance","Well, this books seems to me as the process to finnally admit, that there was a time when Celts were a Great Power and Culture, you know sometimes you dont need a great city to be a ""culture"".It is quite interesting that such a comment could be considered harsh, but Did Mongols have a great city?, why to even think or state the possibility of celts as a creation of a modern mind, are there not enough proves of their existance?Romans couldnt vanish celts from the map, by reducing their cities to ashes with man, woman, elders and babies inside, ""PAX ROMANA"".Proudly for Irish, they have been strong to resist.Romans did make a lot for culture but at the same time, were destroyers of cultures. It is NOT just a mind creation that Jews where so affraid of calling the roman attention to them. They knew what could happen to them.Even without great cities and big monuments, some cultures deserve to be called as what they were."
3,Great stuff but nothing like Miles,Most other reviewers have mentioned Flanger being like a modern day Miles Davis. I'm afraid this shows a severely shallow lack of knowledge on the subject....it's still an enjoyable record but not magic. Templates is techniocally further ahead because the programming and arrangement is tighter but it is still not a swinging jazz record. Flanger should stick to what they do best and programm tricky cool funk beats.
1,What happened?,"I don't get it? Julian should have been the perfect hero -full of agnst and in love yet strong willed. Instead he makes several stupid decisions (I'd fire him if he was my lawyer). Penelope makes even more stupid mistakes. This series is awful. The first two books were wonderful and she should have stopped. Penelope annoys me because she had several opportunties to solve her husband problem, instead she tries running away and being the passive victim hoping somone (usually Julian will save her). What could he possibly see in this inane twit!"
4,great bag,This is more of a womens makeup bag then a mens kit. It is well made and larger then most kits.
1,TERRIBLE,"I just recieved the vitacoco coconut water and have purchased this many times at a local store, but they were out, so I decided to order online. To my dismay this water has a terrible odor and does not taste quite right. I'm extremely disappointed, seeing how I spent $33 and do not know how to contact someone to resolve this matter."
2,It is an acquired taste,"I used this product in smoothies and it performed fine, but I do not like drinking it alone."
5,"Excellent product, subscribe and save makes it even better.","If you like coconut water, this is a great way to get it cheap, and without the hassle of going shopping."
3,not as good as fresh thai coconuts,"Let me preface this by saying that I prefer Thai coconuts to South American ones. Having said that, this drink is pretty good, but it's just not as good as a fresh Thai coconut I get from Chinese grocery stores. I probably wouldn't get it again, but if you like Brazilian or Mexican coconuts, this might be a decent alternative."
2,Not our favorite. Has a tart taste.,"Our family did a little taste test of three brands (we hope to do more in the future, lol). Vita Coco, (from Brazil), Taste Nirvana (from Thailand) and Zico (from Thailand). Vita Coco was the only one with a strong tart taste that none of us liked, we all rated it third of the three (though my 2 year old was still quite happy to drink it all). It's not terrible, but I won't be buying it again now that I see what the difference is. It was striking how easy it was to tell which was which by taste alone."
2,This applies only to my last shipment.,This last shipment did not last good. It had a very old taste. As a person who has been enjoying fresh coconut water from a very early age. This was not the taste of a young fresh coconut.
3,"Good product, too pricey","I liked this product, however the price is just out of our reach budget-wise. Will have to stick to purchasing the coconut water I can get locally at a much better price. It tastes the same and comes in bigger packaging."
5,Refreshing hydrator,Great for rehydrating after exercising. Marvelous mixed with a favorite fruit juice. Just fabulous whenever.
3,It's okay,Thougt I was getting a bargain fur buying in buulk by the case but it turns out the cost is the same as Stop & Shop by the ounce.
4,Excellent Coconut Water,I use this product to refuel after runs or 1.5 hour-long hot yoga classes. Tastes good and does a good job of rehydrating my body naturally.
4,Good product,Nice product and always delivered fresh through neat package. Sometimes pricing is not very compitive; once the price was dropped but i had to call Amazon customer care and get the refund. Costco sells it cheaper. I like the convenience of receiving it every month but i dont need them in winter.
1,I am disappointed,"I was born in a state where coconut water is the second thing after water,The Vita is advertised as pure coconut water but I cant even feel a taste of coconut in it, I do not know if coconut in some countries would taste like this but it is not tasting as I wanted or expected."
2,"Not my first, nor second choice...","I've only tasted O.N.E. and Vita Coco.Taste wise, I suppose they're both okay - it's an interesting (as in quirky...) taste. No bad experience either way.BIG NEGATIVE: Vita ADDS Vitamin C.* Could American companies please stop trying to ""improve"" perfectly good products?* I have no idea what quality the vitamin C is (...don't want it)* I already take a good quality Vitamin C in supplements I researched and chose for myself (...don't want it!)* For the moment, I'll stick to O.N.E. - you can keep the added vitamin C (...did I mention I don't want it?)Nothing beats Natural - and by 'natural', I mean relatively UNprocessed with ZERO additives!"
1,Only if you like a strong soap aftertaste...,"I bought their variety packVita Coco Coconut Water Variety Pack, 11.1 Ounce Tetra Packs (Pack of 12). The flavored ones are pretty bad, but this one is absolutely the worst. Terrible product all around."
2,Smells a bit rotten,I have ordered a lot of Vita Coco in the past but something is not right with this last shipment. The coconut water has a rotten smell to it. The first one that I drank gave me a throat infection and I am still recovering for the ear infection that followed. Not sure if I should bother returning this or contacting the FDA. But this shipment is not right.
1,Misled,"I couldn't believe the positive reviews and why Amazon continues carrying those. Not tasty and with the same packaging as those soy milk, NO STRAWS."
3,amazon is very unfair,"The product is fine, but I am totally disappointed with Amazon for gouging customers, especially subscribing customrs, by raising the price by $6 without prior warning. I'm beginning to very strongly dislike Amazon. I'll bet this review never sees the light of day."
3,"Tastes like ""bad water""","This is the only ""name brand"" coconut water product I have tried, so I don't know if they're all like this, but to me it tastes stale. You can get a better product for MUCH less money at your local ""Asian store""."
2,not the best,"this has a sour taste and no sweetness as expected. one was enough,had to return it. did not taste like the coconut water i know and love."
5,My favorite drink ever!,"This stuff is awesome. It is refreshing and just feels healthy. I think it helped me to recover from my cold faster, too. This is by far the best brand (I've tried 4 or 5 others). Even my husband loves it (he likes the peach mango, I prefer the plain coconut), and he's not even a coconut fan like I am."
2,Sri Lankan Source,"First they switched from Brasilian Coconuts to a Filippines stock, now the latest batch I received is produced in Sri Lanka. The taste is way off, hard to tell it is even Vita. In addition, they print ""Born In Brazil"" on the container, which certainly is misleading."
3,It's OK,"It's OK, but not great. Nirvana coconut water is definitely better (I really like the stuff with pulp).3 stars because it's ""just OK""."
1,this stuff gags me,Totally dissapointed with this drink. Could not give it away! Not one person could stand it! It sounded like anyone who likes coconut would love this drink. But it is really BAD!!
1,Citric acid--yuck!,"The manufacturer lied stating the product is 100% coconut juice. They put cheapo citric acid in there. I drank it and I broke out in a rash. Citric acid is NOT lemon juice. It is a chemical. Either way they should state on the front label ""Only PART coconut juice, other junk in there!"". A citric acid rash takes days to go away.My skin hurts. Ow. I would rate them lower but that option is not available."
1,Tastes like sweat,"I wanted to try this for a long time... wasn't sure what to expect but I assumed it would have some sort of mildly fruity taste. All I can say is 'yuck!' It's like slightly thickened salty water. It's not so salty that it is undrinkable, but it's salty enough to taste foul."
5,refreshing!,"This is not only a great way to hydrate, it's also an extremely refreshing drink. I have been enjoying it for the last few months via a local health food store and am so glad to find it here.Taste is excellent. Again, REFRESHING is the word I'd use. Tasty, yet plain. A lot different than other ""electrolyte"" beverages such as Gatorade.I have made this a regular part of my diet and it's really helped me to stay hydrated this (HOT!!) summer. You will love it!"
4,Great product; terrible pricing increase,tastes great. i love it.what's with the 50% price increase on Amazon. I went from paying about $15 to $23 per pack (Before the subscription discounts). That's highway robbery.I'm canceling my subscription for this product.
2,Sorry,"Sorry, but I cant even take one sip of this stuff. I have no experience with coconut water, so I cant really compare."
1,Disgusting,"Very disappointed. I don't know if I received a bad order, but this stuff is gross. I can't even handle one sip. *barf*"
5,The real thing!,This is the first packaged coconut water that actually tastes like it's fresh from the coconut.
3,Acquired taste,"I ordered Vita Coco because I read how healthy it was, and I thought it would be an excellent alternative to soda. Plus I grew up in South Florida where coconut ice cream and cake were daily specialties. But I rarely drink one of these a week because I haven't seemed to acquire a taste for it. It's very sweet, which normally suits me, but I don't find it compelling enough to want to drink more. I suggest that potential buyers try it and determine how much you like it before making a purchase."
3,Sour coconut,It tastes nothing like fresh coconut juice. Nor does it taste like the frozen kinds. It is not that good. I bought two cases too.The taste is weird. A bit sour like a preservative or acid was added. Coconut should not be sour. It should have a neutral sweet taste. Maybe it is from canned juice or maybe the taste changes after it is pasteurized. I suggest buying real young coconuts in bulk and crack them yourself. Delicious. These Vita Cocos are a little less than ok. I would not drink this everyday.So the good?:Price is okConvenientThe bad?:SourWeird tasteLoss of nutrients through pasteurizationNot goodNot much coconut flavor
1,Not worth it.,"I've been reading all about this product and how great it is so I thought I'd try it. I can't get by the taste, it's just too weird. I definately won't order this again."
3,Sugar-Free But Has 15 Grams of Sugar???,"Tastes good, but I was hoping that it would TRULY be a SUGAR-FREE drink as it claims. But it's not so just be aware of that. Does anyone know of a coconut water sold that's TRULY free of any sugar at all?"
4,Not the best coconut water out there.,"I am a HUGE coconut water fan, for both endurance exercise and for when I am sick or feel like I am coming down with something. Vita Coco is ok, but I don't think it is the best out there as it has a really strong/overwhelming flavor. I really like ONE brand much better. But if Vita Coco is one sale for cheaper, I will buy it."
2,Hit or Miss,"This product is a hit or miss! Sometime it would taste good the other times it would taste sour; like expired milk. I notice the ones from the gas stations / Walgreens would taste different from the ones from Amazon.com & Costco. I would most likely not purchase this brand from Amazon anymore due to a few bad batches, lucky Amazon refunded me the two cases. The coconut water that I am now currently subscribe to is Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water. Its sweeter than the other three big brands, and I'm fine with that. Just as long it don't taste like sour milk, and it have that consistence taste each batch. So try Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water if you are sick with the sourness."
3,Bland taste,"Not what I expected as far as taste.Not much of a coconut flavor, very weak. But not bad for nutritional value."
4,Outstanding value,"Sure, I could nit-pick, and find a minor issue or two. But, for the money spent, this bass is a terrific value."
4,slide,overall the gun is great feels good heavy and abs plastic so it wont break easily only downfall to this gun is that i was hoping the slide would be metal but besides that everything else is good so i give this a 4 out of 5 starts
4,EXCELLENT SF!,"Legend is a very fine read. It was a bit of a ""DUNE"" goes to the city, but in many ways it went farther than DUNE. And in many ways it was an answer to DUNE.The characters are great, extremely believeable, none of this too-good to be true heroism, rather the heroism was that of real people forced to extend themselves."
5,COULD HARDLY BE BETTER,"Legend takes you by the back of the neck and shakes you. I'm not saying it will necessarily change your life, but it will give you hours of reading pleasure, AND it will give you pause and rattle your cage more than a bit."
4,worth it for the Fight among the supers movie!,"Ninja Fantasy is one of those one movie with another movie edited in it! Basically you're watching a Chinese cop movie or whatever with some white guys dress up as ninjas (that's obviously the edited part)! But why you should buy this is becuz of Fight Among the Supers! Fight.... is a great kung fu movie! it's about these two gods (god of chopsticks and god of bowls) who take on students and teach them kung fu so they them to fight each other to see whos a better kung fu master (on the part of the gods of course)! The fight scenes were great! It's some of the best crap you'll see in early 80's kung fu cinema!The picture for the movie is crisp clean, in original language and the subtitles come out good! It's Chinese and Engish subs. The dvd plays how it should! no extras but $10 is worth it! Supers is great and Ninja is good laughs!"
5,Utterly charming,"Charming, witty, and deeply moving without any dripping sentimentality. The correspondence between American writer Helene Hanff and English bookseller Frank Doel is a portrait of an unconventional friendship and a snapshot of postwar England taken by an American friend. Hanff's delight with English history and the bookstore staff's reciprocal pleasure in her interest are brought to life in this lively epistolary account."
3,Quick read,"Pleasant, made me laugh. Glad I read it with Q's Legacy. Not a page turner. Makes you feel good about how people can help each other even when times are bad."
1,People like this Tripe???,"I don't quite know what I was expecting when I checked out this book. I knew that everyone on earth I know who has read it claims that it is perfect for Anglophiles and Bibliophiles. Since I am both, I figured I would love this slim volume of correspondence between a bookseller and a New York freelance writer. It was, sad to say, forgettable. Charming - sure. Sad - of course. A great read - not so much. The letters are short. Not like the wonderful letters of, say Jane Austen or Virginia Woolf and other authors. They were short ""send me this book"" with witty ways of wording thank-yous. I didn't get a feel for either person. Additionally, the blurb on the back states that this book is the collected 20 year correspondence. True, but its like 3 letters a year and most of them - like I stated earlier - orders and thank you responses."
4,A book that has more to offer than at first appears,I ordered the book a few months ago and I must say at first I was taken a back by the style of the author. He is very forthcoming with the views he shares and stays purposeful with his task. The maxims he shares at the end of the book especially added value to the book. Four Stars!
4,Large is really large,I wish there would have been sizing guidelines for this - a large is big enough for an average two year old.
5,Tissues necessary,"As a single woman with no children I had no compelling reason to pick up this book. But for several weeks during my routine Wednesday lunch hours cruisng the book store it would catch my eye and call to me. I finally bought it. It continued to whisper just under my consciousness on my drive home that day. Still in my suit I sat on the edge of the bed to flip through it and get a sense of why I had bought the damn book. Four hours later I had barely moved physically but emotionally had gone from a catch in my throat to belly laughs to biting my lip with tears starting to keep from sobbing.I broke tradition with a Thursday trip to the bookstore to buy copies for each of my sisters.You will cry, but you will also smile. READ THIS BOOK."
5,An outstanding telling of a truly enthralling tale,"Expertly narrated by Kate Hood, is an engaging unabridged audiobook of the novel Kimberley Sun by Di Morrissey. Lily Barton is a beautiful fifty-three-year-old adventurer searching for diversity and change in her life. The setting is a beach on the Kimberly coast in Australia, where Kimberley Sun carries readers through the story of Lily and her daughter Sami, Farouz, the son of an Afghan camel driver, Bobby, the Chinese-Aboriginal man who is caught up in the murder of a German tourist, and Biddy, the survivor of the Captain Tyndall and Olivian era as well as the peculiar artist taking mysterious refuge in the seclusion of the desert. Kimberley Sun is very highly recommended an outstanding telling of a truly enthralling tale as well as the sequel to Di Morrissey's Tears Of The Moon."
4,The 80's Are Back!!!!,I thought it was a pretty funny movie. It defintely brought me a flashback from the 80's. I loved it then and I still love it now. Thats why I absolutely had to add it to my 80's collection!!
4,"""Teen Witch Puts Spell On Comedy""","Teen Witch Starring Robyn Lively is a great comedy for teens and adults alike. The story is about a young girl, love , witch-carft , spells and everything that is true to the heart. If you are looking for a good comedy and a date movie this is the one for you! Rated: PG-13 parents may want to watch along with their children under 12."
5,Teen Witch,"I am 53-years-old and like most things that have to do with Halloween. The movie ""Teen Witch"" is one of my favorite classical movies. I would recommend it to anyone, at any age, who is looking to see what it is like to want to be popular, being popular, and then wanting your origional life back as it was. Great movie!"
4,realistic teen troubles - relatable material,"would love to own a copy but understand it is not currently being released many young teens can relate to the pressure and importance of fitting in if re-released, pls contact me"
3,Cute book,"With Bradbury's recent passing, I somehow stumbled across the fact that he had written this book and bought a used copy -- it's out of print, used is all that one can find. It's mostly a children's picture book though the vocabulary would be kind of tough for a child to whom the illustrations would most appeal. So I guess it's an adult children's book! Hey, it's a ten-minute read, so how could one go far wrong! It's kind of an interesting bit of trivia regarding an author well known for his science fiction (futurism?), and an unexpected turn of his pen."
3,Solid DVD,"I am an avid fan of Jake ""the Snake"" and the dvd is well worth your money. However, I felt the documentary was good but the extras left me feeling so so. Jake was one of the biggest stars of the 80's with some truly great rivalries. For some reason his biggest rivalries seem like they're barely touched on and Randy Savage is completely cut out!! There were some good matches with Ricky Steamboat and Rick Rude but the extras should have had much more to offer."
4,4D MagLite upgraded to an LED,"The 4D cell MagLite is a remarkable piece of equipment in its original form. The upgrading to a LED made it better. I live in the country and I need a light that will brighten up the dark. This one does it. The color rendition with the LED is great, even better than with the original bulb.Chris"
5,Finally the Truth about Me,"This book finally helped me make sense of my life. Why things were the way they were in my home growing up, why I married the person I did, and why we got divorced. The explanation of my history was right there in this book. Also, how to get healed and recovered.If you are ready to hear the truth about your heart, and to face the pain, and to get healed, you are ready for Life Passages for Men."
3,Envelopes,These basically do what normal envelopes should do so I am not sure what to put in a review other than I wish the paper was thicker since you can see through these fairly easy. If you just need normal envelopes than get you a box but if security is your deal then maybe not or just cover up items of importance in the envelope with paper or something.
4,Cute Jersey,"It is a cute jersey, but definitely runs small. I am normally a size M, but I read a review and I am glad I ordered a large."
5,Hard to read...harder to live,"What a grand legacy was left to author George Parker by his father and grandfather.This is not light or easy reading, but is worth your time because it gives you a real sense of history and a terrific overview of how politics has shaped modern thinking and vice versa.Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty good, for early L'Engle","This book is notable for several reasons: in typical L'Engle ""nepotistic"" style, it features the younger version of characters who appear in later books (Virginia Porcher, _House Like a Lotus_, and Mimi Oppenheimer, _A Severed Wasp_); and it features characters who obviously evolved into two important characters of her more recent Young Adult fiction, Zachary Gray and Max Horne. While a fascinating read, this book does not have the maturity of writing that Ms. L'Engle developed in her more recent adult fiction."
2,Average Work From the king,I know Tubbys work and I would have to agree with Shaka from Russia that this is definitely not one of Tubbys better works! The best tubby album I have come across is Dangerous Dub. Pure Heavyweight Bass lines and hardcore riddims! Dub like dirt is very average in comparison to Tubbys other works. I wouldnt recommend this album but to each his own. Respect!
3,"Young Pianist loves dynamics, clueless about Scriabin","Wow, I didn't know that Scriabin was supposed to sound like somebody just hit on the head. Otherwise ok cd, get at a good price."
5,Wonderful,"There's not much I can say about this book that hasn't already been said. It is absolutely wonderful, very colorful and easy to follow, it doesn't bore you to death with useless facts. The stories are rich and fascinating and the pictures captivating.If you have even the tiniest bit of interest in POWs in America or Missouri - this is a definite must-have."
4,Vurtual feathers,"Vurt is an odd beast. I found it hard to start with, but soon the world had sucked me in. In futuristic Manchester those looking for hallucinogenic experiences suck on feathers to enter virtual worlds, Vurts. Stash Riders, a bunch of miscellaneous losers, hunt for interesting feathers and try to find Desdemona, who got stuck in a bad Vurt.Noon has cooked up a futuristic and surrealistic world. The language is colourful and takes some getting used to. The world isn't explained thoroughly; some readers will certainly find Vurt too strange a feather to swallow. However, if you can accept that the world doesn't always make sense, the story moves on with a good pace and the plot is interesting.Vurt isn't the easiest and most accessible book, but it's worth the effort. If you like it, there's more: Noon has written several books set in the same vurtual world."
5,"For the selected few, the find of a lifetime","For those who enjoy being challenged by what they read, enticed into a world so different that one can actually relate to it, then Jeff Noon's novel Vurt is for you. Do not despair if others have rated this work poorly; this is only because they are not willing to open their minds and revel in the totality of this book's genius. Vurt is an awesome read that will make your head spin, sending ideas and messages much appreciated if you can only interpret them. Although I cannot openly give this book to all of my friends, those whom I knew would appreciate it returned it with much praise. Vurt comes with a well warning, but like English Voodoo (you'll find out about this later) will also captivate your mind with some truly amazing literature. Vurt deserves every laude it receives."
3,Noon does OK,"Noon's 'Vurt' is a simple story told with complex and imaginative details. The characters and settings are wildly imaginative but lack a certain depth and development. I think Noon has a good story here, and a strong enough creativity, but 'Clockwork Orange', as it's been compared, this is not."
5,READ THIS BOOK unless......,"....You are younger (<16), you don't like reading about drug use, don't like cyber-punk-sci-fi-fanasy novels, don't like being simultaniously confused and enthralled, or didn't enjoy the original Alice in Wonderland story. This book is excellent, especially for people who love doing mental yoga and/or have a history of psychedelic use. Cheers"
5,One of the best,"This is most definately one of the best books there are to read out there. The plot pulls you into the Vurt, it's amazing. This is Noon's best work, no doubt."
2,Not for the heavy chewer,"Though I wasn't expecting a lot from a soft toy, I was hoping that this would be able to provide a little more relief for my teething pup. While the bone is easy to use and freeze, the actual 'enjoyment' time is limited and not worth the time it takes to refreeze. After about 5 minutes, the bone was thawed to the point it was dripping and could easily have holes chewed in the fabric. When I went to refreeze it, my poor pup didn't understand why I was taking her toy and ended up becoming disinterested very quickly the next time I brought it out.Another issue I hadn't thought about until after freezing is how hard and heavy the bone becomes. If you have a puppy that likes to 'throw' their toys or pounce on them, this can become a flying projectile.Though it did seem to help with the soreness of teething, and provide a cool treat, the overall experience left a lot to be desired."
1,Poor quality,"My puppy loved this product...for about 3 minutes. Thats how long it lasted before he had chewed a hole in it and pulled out the stuffing, rendering it useless. Way over priced for the quality. I wish I had come here and read reviews first, a $2 walmart towel soaked in water and frozen has been a way more durable option, which my puppy loves."
4,GOOD chew toy !!!,"I have a German shepherd mix that isn't a heavy chewer but he's going through a faze of chewing so instead of losing my clothes to his teeth I got this. I got it locally but when I read the reviews on here I thought I would write my own. The fact is I love this I can freeze it over night and it will last for an hour or two or him just chewing on it, or I can freeze it for an hour or two and it will last about 15-20 minutes. It all depends on if I'm home or not. The point of this story is that I like this toy because he has stopped chewing on my clothes and started chewing on this and his kongs. (Which he wasnt before). I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a dog going through a chewing faze."
5,Great product and great service,Paper arrived in good shape and on time for a very important job. I will order again when I need similar products.
4,The Sad Saga of Chief Joseph,"I picked this book up after traveling along the Chief Joseph highway in Utah. It is a well written depiction of the events and travesties of the Nez Perce. It also somewhat lets the reader see that although a great leader, Joseph was not perfect and that there are some who do not believe he was a great a leader as he was depicted in history. Overall, a well researched book which gives the reader an inside view to the thoughts and actions of Chief Joseph and other leaders of the Northwest Native American tribes."
2,Very disappointing for the price,"I was extremely disappointed in Bulova for making such a cheap, inferior product. What looks like silver is actually just silver plastic, the crystals look cheesy, and the chime is synthesized music. Yuck, yuck, yuck, this is going back."
4,Koolatron 8qt Traveler III Cooler,"Power: 3 amps, 36 watts.Heats to 135F (57C). There is no heat-cool switch, you just turn the cord, blue dot to arrow=cool, red to arrow=warm.This cooler has a fan that turns when it's cooling, I wish there was a switch to turn off the fan for maximum power saving and quiet operation."
4,Very nice addition to my hybrid,"This is a very high quality product. It shipped quickly, arrived as expected, and fits great on my bike. They allow for a much more natural hand position than what a flat bar can provide, and allow me to bike into strong winds by lowering my profile over the bars. My only complaint is that the bar caps that came with the product are a little too big, I had to trim them slightly to fit into my bars.Other than that, a very solid bar end. Would purchase from this brand again."
2,Looks OK and sturdy - No adhesive.,"This looks OK, but it does not include adhesive or tape, so it will not stick to the wall. You have to get that separately. There are not any instruction so I did not know how to cut it. Tried a miter saw and it cracked it. It is wide enough for an AC cord+about 3 other low voltage cords which is nice."
3,Small,Barely got the job done pay attention it is very small I was hoping it would have been a lot bigger kind of disappointed
2,"Dracula, Come To My Aid!!!","Holy crap! Two truly demented chop-socky epics on one disc for one low price. I would rate this disc a little higher if the transfer quality were better. Both films will appeal to fans of godawfully inept vampire-fu for sure, but just be warned that the audio/visual mastering is at times distractingly bad."
4,Worth the money!!,The picture does not do this product justice. This is a beefy head and is well made.
3,Interesting,"Useful and well discussed book about two of the more interesting and well-known works by Evagrius Ponticus.The discussion is well presented, concise but not superficial. The book can be an useful starting point for all those readers who have an interest in the Desert Father. Unfortunately, there are not references to the source material nor any analysis of the original text.Overall, I enjoyed reading this work."
4,Thanks to all the mums of the world...,"I purchased this book because I read it at a friend's house. Their daughter had given it to them, and I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to give it to my mum. So, I went online, purchased it, and I believe I gave it to her on Mother's Day. Boy: she was surprised, and after reading it, she said that she really enjoyed the book. She also noted that it was a sweet thought both of me to give it to her on Mother's Day, and what is said in the book.Show your mother you appreciate her. Tell her how unique she is, how her beauty shines, and your gratitude for everything that she has endured as well as the woman she has become."
2,Puccini & Verdi Duets and Scenes,I purchased this CD particularly for the duet from the Pearl Fishers which was lovely. However the rest of the CD with a few exceptions comprises a majority of unfamiliar arias/duets that are frankly quite boring. Why do they always seem to do this with these operatic selections. There are so many beautiful arias to choose from. Very disappointing.
2,"The Pearl Fishers, this cd is not","I must have misread the cd description, or maybe it was not stated that this is a 'potpourri of duets' with the Pearl Fishers duet as the lead. I thought it was misleading. This is the first time I had had such an experience with Amazon, so I will definitely be much more careful in reading the description of the product prior to purchase. Caveat Emptor from 'Disappointed opera-lover in Wilmington North Carolina'"
4,Worth it,"for the auxiliary input alone. Although, that negates the need for the CD player. I plug my Ipod into the face mounted jack, and I'm good to go. The sound is good for the price point, but navigating the various set up options can be bewildering.I'd completely forgotten it came with a remote control! I threw the silly thing away before even checking if it had batteries. What were they thinking?This is a good utilitarian radio/CD deck. The front mounted aux input sets it apart from anything else I've seen in it's class. I've had mine for over a year. I'm still happy with it."
1,Sucks real bad,"Another one of those movies you wish you didn't buy. But for the price what could you expect? Sometimes I get good movies I only pay a couple bucks for. This is definitely not one of them. I wouldn't buy this movie for 50 cents. But if you want to waste your time and be disappointed, buy it. I will say that the 18 bronze girls wasn't as bad as the 18 golden destroyers. But both are pretty bad."
5,If you like the African Beats...,"Kwaku (also known as Martin) is one of my teachers so there certainly is a lot I can say about this music. I first discovered this album when he played excerpts from it for the class. I thought right away, wow! I bet many people would be surprised to know that jazz actually comes from African! This guy masterfully honors his African heritage in a way that others would find it hard to do. Pick this album up! (Warning!!! Side effects may include but are not limited to: feeling the beat, a sudden urge to dance, whooping & hollering, a feeling that says that was the best [...] you ever spent, & so on.) MUSICIANS: KKO-african percussion, voice, drums with Wes Brown-acoustic upright bass; Jay Hoggard-xylophone, voice; Will Lowe-trombone; Ho Bynum-trumpet, flugel; Paul Austerlitz-bass clarinet; Mike Veal-drums; Dominic Kanza-guitar; Ismail Lawal-drums, percussion; Gloria Koomson, Jeff Penn-percussion; Scott Kessel, Rani Arbo-voice."
4,Its ok,This necklace is ok. The circle thing didnt have enought detail. And the crystal felt like it was about to fall of. But It's ok.
1,1960's Shock Movie,"This movie is horrible, badly acted and is by today's standards a R rated movie. Dont waste time or money on it, wish I hadn't!"
5,Murder mystery filled with exciting American Indian insight,"This was the 1st book I'd read by the Gears and, I must admit, I was very pleasantly surprised. I'm more of the suspense/murder mystery best seller type reader and this book had all of those elements, plus so much more.I love books where you're pulled in from the 1st page AND you learn new things as you quickly flip from page to page. This is one of those books.I'm definitely going to read some more of the Gears' work....Hope they're all this great."
3,Quite Different than the Rest,"This book was quite different from the rest of the series. It was more a prehistoric mystery than a recreation of the Algonquin people. It was a pretty good mystery, but the usual fine descriptions of prehistoric life were missing. Maybe the Gears are getting tired of their series. I do still want to finish the last book in the series - People of the Masks."
5,Wonderful!,"I am a huge fan of the First North American series. This book is certainly among my favorites. It keeps you guessing and there are many twists and turns. I have a very difficult time finding large print books now that I am legally blind, but I am thrilled I was able to find this one. A very good read!"
5,great product and price,installed myself on 97 TJ 4.0 liter...4 months ago. great instructions and very simple to install yourself. not to mention upgrades it to turbine tech. best price I found on internet! paid $205 incl. shpping. other places were $250-$300 for exact same product. one small glitch is...that my fuel gage still shows not being full even when tank is full...but I think that has to do with something else that was inherent on these models. restored my fuel pressure immediately and no more backfiring. great product!
2,boring,"I assume the books are good, but as most movies made from a book, they have to stick in all the parts you expect, and don't leave room for a plot or any character development. Not much here."
1,Bleh!,"The movie is everything the book series was not: tedious, unimaginative, contrived, poorly cast and a colossal yawn. I would have had more fun repeatedly hitting myself over the head with a roller skate. The only good thing about this movie was that I rented, versus buying it. You couldn't pay me enough to watch this train wreck again."
4,Great family fun,Super movie for some family laughs! Kid-appropriate for the most part although the aunt is a bit eccentric :) Especially funny if you have read this will your children and/or your children have read this.
4,Great family movie,Love watching this with my little girls. My 4 year old really likes it too. Its a really cute movie we can all enjoy together.
1,Didn't fit,"Seller claims cartridge fits Canon copier D320 - it doesn't. I guess if you get something that regularly goes for $150 for $14, you should anticipate that something's up. This cartridge did not work in my copier so I'm out $14 but a bit wiser for the next round."
2,Good background but bad story,I liked the way the author showed racism in the world of Shadowrun. That was the only strongpoint of the book though. The story was just plain stupid: how many people are going to save the world 'as we know it' in RPG novels? The author should have used a different plot to highlight the racial undertones of the novel.
4,BIG BILL HAS WHAT IT TAKES,"I recently added this CD to my 300 plus blues CD collection. The guitar work by long time Muddy Waters guitarist, Bob Margolin is as solid as ever. The songs are well written and Big Bill has what it takes to deliver them in the tradition of the Blues. I am somewhat perplexed by the statements that this is Big Bill's ""debut"" however, as a year earlier, he recorded Big Bill Morganfield: Nineteen Years Old which is available on Taxim records directly at Taxim.com. Both CD's are worth adding to your collection as is Bob Margolin's Hold Me To It. All are highly recommended."
2,VIBRANT COLORS,"The photography for this 1960 (?!) tv show is fantastic----almost dayglow colors for the sets and costumes. The photography is certainly the best thing about this disc.Way back then one hour shows were actually 50 minutes long, not the 45 or less minutes now days, so for one disc and two episodes it's akin to a full lenth movie. For a kids' show, the sets are cheap, but that's part of its charm.The Oz episode is the best of the two, for the obvious reason that Temple lost out to Garland in the movie version, though here she's playing a different role. And Arthur Treacher is in this episode too, after he and Temple were in a John Ford (!) movie together. Arthur Treacher, of his fish and chips fast food chain, and Merv Griffin's talk show sidekick.It's probably only worthwhile for a curio, Shirley Temple as an adult with some cleavage, and an nbc 1960 (?) show in peacock color, but I paid less than 25 cents for my copy, so, for that price you can't go wrong."
5,El Jinete Polaco,"Excellent book! the amazing narrative it makes you visualize every single line. You are not reading a book, you are really ""seeing"" what is happening. A masterpiece!"
2,The old way once more and the same mistakes,"This book suffers from the basic mistakes that the early books on Flash had. Animation is only taught later in the book and some of the most exciting features are not covered. By the time the reader gets to anything interesting, he/she will have lost any interest or looked for a different book. This is the kind of book that challenges any novice to go beyond the first 30 pages. Some do, many don't. And the book still gets sold. It also helps to sell more Flash books, since the reader will often think the problem lies with himself/herself. Not too bad?"
3,"Unfortunately, not the original movie","The original movie included segments in Technicolor. This is the censored version, all B&W, with around 9 minutes of footage cut. Most of the Technicolor footage came during the Follies show portion of the movie, so we not only miss the color, we also miss a lot of the spectacle. Moreover, the existing commercial versions offered on DVD are madse from degraded film, not the original masters. As a result, video quality suffers. There is a restored version of the original masterts in the archives at UCLA, but to my knowledge, it has not been released commercially. In the meanwhile, this DVD offers a good watch, albeit with less Follies than hoped for."
3,Icarus - Six Soviet Misfits,"Strange electronic free jazz from Icarus on SIX SOVIET MISFITS, which compiles two 12""s as well as an unreleased album. ""UL-6"" starts the proceedings with long washes of sound, underpinned with some spare breaks, while ""Borichean Pintak"" piles on clattering percussion. The short ""Deutsche Oper"" has some longing strings reminiscent of the Kammerflimmer Kollektief, and ""Benevolent Incubator"" has a gentle guitar-and-piano line atop a stuttering rhythm. ""Nine Fresian"" gets even more abstract, eschewing a definite melody in favor of atmospherics, while ""Dolphin Lylic"" offers a bubbly counterpoint. ""Xot Zoiks"" merges the jittery rhythm with a see-sawing melody, and ""Skate Glug"" has an improvisational clarinet dancing all over the surface of the track. A sonic adventure."
1,And A Nightengale Sang,This is the second time this has happened to me. It is not for America and does not state that.From now on I will stick to Amazon instead of getting things from other places.I am sure I checked and it said #2 but it was not.
2,"It protects, but is not user friendly...","Yes it protects from scratches very effectively and doesn't hide the ipod beneath, but it is seriously difficult to get off once it's on. I've had this cover for like 2 years and I have to pry it off with a pin or file every time! (no joke) What's worse, it doesn't allow all chargers/hook-ups/docks full access to the bottom port. NOT recommended... keep looking for something better."
2,Took a chance and disappointed,"I used Aqua Di Gio for years but it began to be too sweet for me. Looking for something more masculine but not overpowering I took a chance on this, going by the description and the reviews, because I couldn't find it locally. Unfortunately I don't care for this cologne. To me it is a sweet, thick, syrupy smell and it doesn't last long (thank goodness). I tried it a few days hoping I'd change my mind but it always reminds me of an old ladies perfume. I have enjoyed Kenneth Cole's Black and will stick with it until I find something better. Let me interject one possible disclaimer: The bottle was warm when it arrived. It had been riding in a UPS truck all day and it was another 100 degree day. So maybe the heat ruined it and I should never order cologne in the summer! But a lot of products must experience this, whether delivered to the home or a merchant."
5,cd review Beethoven concertos,"Performances on this cd are old[dating to the early 1960's]but they are among the best of renditions of these two pieces. The 4th piano concerto is especially good, perhaps one of the best I have heard. The 5th concerto is also well done but doesnt have the same standout feel to it that Mr. VanCliburn produced doing Beethovens' 4th concerto. Overall, a very good, very well done cd that belongs in anyones collection."
5,Excellent,This is truly a beautiful CD! It arrived in a timely manner; I am very happy with the product and service.
3,Relaxing Classical Music from Amazon,"I should know better than to order this type of disc. It's a conglomeration of ""relaxing"" music played in a mediocre quality by musicians most of whom are unknown."
2,Not relaxing,I bought this CD to use for massage clients. Too many crescendos. I would not suggest it for this use.
5,Sooooo Nice!,This is indeed relaxing music and so beautiful! I play it a lot around the house and highly recommend it.
5,enjoyable,sounds great on my kindle.worth the money. I will be looking for more like this one to help relax with
5,Keep Your Secret!,"If you're like me, you're buying your silky panties online for one reason: discretion. Nobody wants to be judged in the stores, and the pink and white Victoria's Secret package is a dead give away to your postman. That's why these panties are great. They come in a discret brown package, so nobody has to know that you're getting ready to envelop yourself in the satin goodness."
2,The pictures was misleading!,"I ordered a 6 pack of underwear a few weeks again. I had been trying to find my size in a plain color or a print for several months with no luck. I searched amazon and low and behold there they were! While the picture showed the underwear being purple and having flowers on them it was still better then most of the stuff I saw in stores. Unfortunately when I opened the box I found out they were leopard print, much to my dismay."
2,quality,the quality is not what I expected.very disappointed.very disappointed.very disappointed.very disappointed.very disappointed.very disappointed.very disappointed.
1,A great read - of fiction,One of the least enformed authors on the Assyrians. A most detractive read centering on Baath propaganda and very little historical fact.
3,Only buy this item if you know which soft plug to put it in!,I bought this frost plug since KATS did list this fitting on the Nissan GA160DE engine however I think it only may be listed as such since it is a 30mm plug. I knocked out 4 soft plugs on my nissan and it wouldn't fit it any of them. So I went to Napa and for $30 I got one that came with instructions on which exact soft plug to put it in and the electrode was smaller to fit in.
2,a pleasant but nevertheless outdated 100 page booklet,"A brief but pleasant to read booklet - entitled as a manual.Needs to update materials since a lot has changed as far as eletronics go since 1984( publishing year). Contents are limited to 7 chapters and many important weapon , tactical and legal issues go uncovered."
5,Joshua Jackson in One Week,"Joshua Jackson has already been my ALL time favorite actor but the performance in this movie was extraordinary! This movie puts you in a place of reality that some people face everyday & his performance is done so well its as if you were watching HIS story and they have an awesome way of making you feel as though you have actually taken a road trip. Its no wonder he won an award for this! To me, this is a must see that may help alot of people put their life's priorities back in order."
3,Not sure about this one...,"To tell you the truth, after watching this movie, I'm still not sure how I felt about it. Granted, Joshua Jackson is fabulous. I love him in just about everything he does. The story has got a good premise, something that could resound with anyone. (It's the what-if situation where something unexpected happens and turns your life upside down. Which is then followed by the inevitable journey of self discovery and what's the meaning of life.) It wasn't a horrible movie, just different. The narrator's voice is a bit jarring at times compared to the slow, gradual pace of the movie. I know it was shot in Canada, but you don't have to be a Canadian to appreciate the landscape and scenery. If you're looking to watch it, I would try and rent it first if you can. See how you feel about it yourself. Personally, I'm glad I own it, but only cause it was on sale. Check it out for yourself."
5,Problems and Wishes,"Willafred, a 12 year old girl, has problems beyond beleif. Her mother has her under strict rules. No glamour for Willa! She moves from place to place, and now she is in Bramble, Cape Cod. Her nanna is there, she finally makes a best friend, her mother,Stella, is falling for her English teacher Sam, and Willa's wishes are finally coming true!"
3,what is the distributor trying to pull????,"I had previously viewed this book at the library and was so impressed with the contents that I had to buy my own. This book covers in detail everything one could think of running a small farm. But the book was supposed to be new!!!! If I wanted a used book I would have payed less money for one. It arrived with dirt inside, bent corners, written in, and very scuffed up! What is going on?"
5,Awesome book especially for newbies,My husband and I decided to buy 10 acres and leave the city life 3 years ago. We were like fish out of water. I am sure our new neighbors had a few chuckles. We were not able to decide on what we wanted to do with our new land so I purchased this book to study the different ideas. This book has been an excellent source of information. We were able to get started in raising Boer goats. The book explained everything we needed to get started including setting up the housing and fence. So far we have been successful in breeding and increasing our herd. We now have decided to start raising chickens and pulled out the book again to get prepared.I strongly recommend this book for anyone who is looking into raising livestock. It is staple on our shelf and provides all of the information that we need.
5,This thing ROCKS,"Kids threw something into the toilet and I was unable to get it unclog, almost had to call a plumber which would have cost $$$. This thing is HUGE it comes in a box about the size of a small dresser. Very easy to use and unclog my toilet in no time."
4,Aussie talent at its best,This album is pretty cool and definately worth buying if your into punk. It mixes it up between punk and rap and the vocals are great.The only down side is that it verges on being cheesey with songs like 'rip it up' but it is a great album to listen to when getting pissed with mates.
4,"Good, cheap product with some flaws","The first 69 Ultimate X-men comics are here with the Annual for a very affordable price. Unfortunately it is on your computer, so it doesn't have the same feel as comic book. The program runs on Adobe Reader and you can view the picture, zoom, rotate, etc. There's no installation all you need is a CD-rom drive on your computer. The scans are crisp and clear. My biggest complaint is that the CD does not include Ultimate War, a cross-over between The Ultimates and the X-men. There are major plot gaps without these comics, and I am not getting the entire Ultimate X-men story."
4,Jan plays the blues,This album features Jan Akkerman and Curtis Knight (who sadly died recently) playing the blues. Curtis Knight made his name in the 1960's and featured a guitarist by the name of Jimi Hendrix in his band. This album features a number of Jimi's songs and covers (including Little wing and All along the watchtower) and in keeping with the tradition of the blues this record is raw with some fierce blues playing from Akkerman and soulful vocals from Knight.As for previous comments about Jan Akkerman never being in a vocal band check out his early work with The Hunters and his pre-Focus hard rock band Brainbox.
2,"I love Akkerman's guitar, but King's vocals are a bust.","Jan Akkerman is an awesome guitarist, but the combination of he and King Curtis doesn't work (Just as his earlier attempt to include vocals on the, ""FOCUS CON PROBY"" album was also a disaster). Jan is best when he's doing only instrumental work on his albums. The vocalists and song selections are weird. I have most all of Akkerman's work, and would not reccommend this one."
3,just get it,"the pretenders are a great band. they are a great album band and such, any greatest hits album will not do them justice. however, they do have lots and lots of great singles which are worth listening to, in and of themselves. i am not going to give this record a great rating, but i am going to recommend it highly simply because all the songs on here are worth listening to, on their own merit. very good stuff. it's the pretenders, for god's sake."
3,"OK for diehard fans, but get CD1 first","""Beautiful Day"" is a great single. However, if you are going to pay a significant amount of money for a single, obtain the other version of this single first, which has two unreleased NEW songs - ""Always"" and ""Summer Rain"".For the diehard fans, this CD may be worth it - while some websites have incorrectly indicated that this CD2 has two songs from the fans-only CD 'Hasta La Vista Baby', actually, ""If You Wear That Velvet Dress"" is not on that CD. However, I would recommend trying to find the Australian version of this CD first, which also has a live version of ""Last Night on Earth"" (which was also not included on 'Hasta La Vista Baby')."
4,"Alicia Bridges ""I Love The Nightlife""","For those wondering about the song's inclusion on this DVD, the studio has given us viewers 2 slaps in the face and a kick in the groin. Slap 1 - The song ""I Love The Nightlife"" is not included in the nightclub scene on this DVD release. Slap 2 - The song title and Alicia Bridges' name is STILL mentioned in the credits though. Go figure. Kick In The Groin - There is a ""theatrical trailer"" included that contains almost the entire scene WITH THE ALICIA BRIDGES SONG STILL INTACT!!!!!!!!!! How can they have the ""rights"" to use the song with the trailer and not get the ""rights"" to use the song in the film. GEEEEEZZZZ!!!"
1,"Love the movie, but this edition BITES","I was thrilled to see one of my favorite comedies released on DVD. I agree with the review by bobtec. The dance sequence number ""I Love the Nightlife"" is still missing in this home video version. To me, it was one of the best moments in the film. To see it replaced with another song just ruined it for me. VHS had the same problem. I ended up selling my DVD after one viewing. However, if the song means nothing to you it is a nice digital transfer. Funny, the trailer has the song in it. Bobtec got it right. Wait for a TV broadcast."
1,No night life!!!,"I am so pissed that this doesn't have the original ""I love the night life"" song during the dance scene!!! It was one of the best parts of the movie!!Who do I complain to?!?????I really want my money back!!!"
4,A Bite Out Of Disco. . .,"Leave the tannest man alive to become a pale vampire and chase a New York supermodel over the centuries. Leave his competition as the decendant of von Helsing himself. And set that all to ""I Like the Nightlife"" and you get ""Love at First Bite."""
2,Not as funny as it should be,"Another George Hamilton parody film. This one could have been so much better. It had really great actors and a funny plot, but the script is pathetic."
1,RIP OFF !!!!,"Doe's not include the theme song, I Love The Nightlife, for that reason I will not buy this!!!Put the dvd out with the song on it and yes I will buy it!"
2,monroe 71665 sesnsa trac strut,"seemed fine out the box but about a month later and after the box was destroyed, the left strut makes lots of noise so I will have to replace again. Seemed like a good deal, oh well."
2,Strong & sturdy but cumbersome & slow,"I've used this tripod for about 3mos now and this is my experience with it.PROS:-strong-tall-quick angle adjustments-rubber feet-pan/tilt motion is goodCONS:-not a quick-release system, turning the knobs to adjust the legs is a SLOW task and quickly becomes annoying-the shoe lock/release mechanism uses so much pressure when locked, you have to use a gross amount of force to unlock it and have to be careful not to knock your camera out if you accidently slip in the process-no geared center column-no bubble-heavySuffice to say, I'm looking for a new tripod to replace this one."
2,Copy Protection is a deal breaker,"The deal breaker for me was that this machine will not record copy protected programs. I have a satellite dish with HBO and the GX 315 will not record any HBO programing. HBO allows ""one copy"" to be made. This machine (and I understand ALL SONY DVD recorders) did not allow the recording. I called SONY and they offered a soulution that did not work. Beware of manufacturers that provide hardware AND content as SONY does."
1,hunk of junk,"Worst sony product i've ever bought!1. Terrible picture at all speed levels. (I own a trinatron TV which I like)2. I've made several ""coasters"" as well to borrow from a previous review.3. Remote stinks, doesn't work half the time.4. Annoying start up time.It's gotta go, very dissapointing."
3,A bit disappointing,"I would probably buy this again, but I was a bit disappointed. It would be better if it came at least partially pre-assembled. Product cost was steep, and the rocket car was not as easy to build as one would like. After we built it, and followed the directions for launching, it went crooked. However, we still had fun, and it was a good opportunity to discuss chemical reaction, thrust, and of course counting down to ""blast Off"" was fun too. I plan to use some of the parts from the rocket car to build a smaller version, which hopefully will be less inclined to wander off at a slant."
4,The Investigation Continues...,"Thomas Sancton and Scott MacLeod not only present a well researched and highly readable journey through the details and and facts of the death of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed that are known to date, but challenge their readers to explore the unanswered questions which keep reason for the accident a mystery. We have all speculated about whether the paparazi, the driver, or a second car was responsible for the tragedy but this book weaves the thread of their lives, loves, family, with the circumstances of their untimely death. I never thought I would have more questions about the accident after I read this book than before but I do. This may prove that the authors have done their job well to not only state the facts but describe the ongoing investigation. It is now our responsibility to demand further answers from those investigators. I enjoyed reading this book and would easily recommend that others do so as well."
4,Death of a Princess: The Investigation by Thomas Sancton,"I liked this book. Very interesting. I followed all the media news and just could not get enough to satisfy my curiosity until I read this book. I don't know why I have been so touched by her death? It is a mystery to me, also? I just liked her when she was alive and was shocked at hearing about her accident. I, too, ordered the tape of John Elton's song about her. I want to thank all the readers who gave their comments on this book, it helped me to buy this book."
5,Good Profile,"Just small enough to not look obnoxious on top of a car's trunk, and the cable is plenty long enough to fit from the trunk up to the dashboard."
4,Midland 18-2442,"I bought the Midlad antenna model 18-2442 to go with the Midland CB radio. I had to search it out, because there was a statement that customers were purchasing a cobra antenna for the radio. It came, and I hooked it up and I was pleased at the performance. I was hearing things form the freeway which is about 5 miles from where I live. And it was cheaper to which makes it nice.After purchasing it, I recommened the antenna to a couple of guys who rv with us. There is a backlog on the antennas. Hope they fill it it soon."
4,A wonderful door for children to enter the idea of the past.,"I read this book to my fourth grade class as an introduction to our study of history. It began a great discussion about the past, what people remember, and why. We also talked about families and how we are connected to each other. The book beautifully illustrates how a family history develops from the stories we tell each other. It's a book to be shared with the children you care about."
4,good for serious U2 fans,"""Beautiful Day"" is a good song, certainly destined to be a classic. This time, it appears that they have not taken a misstep with regard to choosing the first single (as they did with ""Numb"" and ""Discotheque""). The b-sides are worth the buy for the serious U2 fans or those who end up really liking 'All That You Can't Leave Behind.'""Summer Rain"" is an infectious tune that, with a tad bit more work on the lyrics, could have been more than a b-side.""Always"" is an interesting b-side for the same reason that ""Lady with a Spinning Head"" (from the 'Achtung Baby' sessions) was. That is, as others have pointed out, this song sounds like an early (or later) manifestation of ""Beautiful Day"" with the similarities in the music. The chorus a la Mr. Roboto is kinda fun as well."
4,worth a listen!,"Two new songs:Summer Rain is nice, but rather ordinary in the world of U2 b-sides. Always is to Beautiful Day what Lady With The Spinning Head is to The Fly. Just like Lady With The Spinning Head, Always is a great tune and makes picking up this single worth every penny."
4,A happy arousing.....,"This song is indeed catchy, it has it's political views if you want it to, about losing it all and never feeling more happy. It of course, pertains to life and makes you feel like it actually is a beautiful day. It's not 100% POP and it's not 100% Joshua Tree, it's a blend along with a twist of something new they have to offer. Anticipate the best, U2 will never fail!!!"
4,"Just a little heavy, but stable as a rock and easy to set up","This is the 10th tripod that I have purchased over the years, from a cheap Ambico to a professional video Bogen / Manfrotto (for my range spotting scope). This unit exceeded my expectations in terms of degrees of freedoms, construction quality, stability at full extension and ease of positioning. I have no trouble recommending this as an excellent, low cost tripod (in spite of it being a wee bit on the heavy side). It is a perfect mount for my wife's Canon El-pd1."
3,GOODBYE TO THE MOVE....HELLO E.L.O.,"Alot of Move fans really like this album and I have to say it is good BUT I don't think it's as good as everybody thinks. I've had this CD for about three months now and I still think ""Looking On"" is a better album and that one was hated by most of thier fans. One promblem that I have with this album is that it just doesn't sound like it's finished in places. Some of the songs are great(It Wasn't My Idea To Dance, Words of Aaron, The Ben Crawley Steel Company) but others sound too much like the Beatles(say hello to Jeff Lynne). I think this album could've used a little more production work. I suspect that Roy,Jeff,and Bev only did this because they had to. The Electric Light Orchestra was what they wanted to get going. Although I think this album is flawed by what sounds like a rushed production, I still like it and think that anyone interested in The Move should hear it. I just don't think it's brilliant."
5,INTERACTIVE: ONE OF THE MOST,"BEAUTIFUL BOOKS FOR CHILDREN !In a very interesting child story, it drives them to feel the joy of life, to intearct with their own toys and to color the drawings.This book will keep your children interested for a very long time and leave them fine moral lessons"
1,Complete disappointment.,"I don't understand why I have to pay $7.99 for just the Seeker book when I can buy Volumn 4, on this same website for the exact same price, that includes Seeker, Origins, and Eclipse. I bought a Kindle Fire so I wouldn't have to find room for more books. But if it's going to cost me $24.00 to get these three books on my Kindle and only $7.99 to buy a paperback of these books I will make more room for books. I'm very disappointed over this unbelievable mark up just to read this book on my Kindle."
4,Eye Candy Galore,"This movie has eye-candy overload! If you like erotic movies with hot boys and a crazy twisted storyline, this is one to get! This movie easily gives a lot of other gay movies a run for their money. I loved every piece of it. There are a lot of campy little references that I found to be a lot of fun. For a low budget flick, this is awesome!"
2,"Was nice, Until it died on me...","I got a Dell DJ in the spring of 2004. It was a great little MP3 player with long battery life and good audio. It wasn't long after I had it until the headphones that came with the DJ got a short in them and quit playing. So I contacted Dell support and they sent me another pair ASAP only to have them do the exact same thing. The plastic around the plug is very cheaply made and prone to cracking, which was the source of the problem. Then one day in the spring of 2006 I was walking on the tread mill listening to my DJ when it suddenly stopped playing. Something had went wrong with the hard drive and nothing I could do would make it work again. So I tossed it in the trash and bought an iPod which was much better."
1,Don't invest the time or money!,"Do not invest your time nor money on a Dell DJ. Mine lasted exactly one year and one day before it locked up and never worked again. All the hours spent downloading my CDs were wasted, as well as all the money spent downloading songs because they're all gone forever. There is no repair option through Dell and it took me an hour and a half on the phone and four transfers (and one disconnection) to find this out. They did supply me with one option that cost (with a discount!) $170, but I'm not foolish enough to invest more money in a product that just does not work properly. If you do purchase this product, keep a paperclip handy because you will have to reboot it constantly. Save yourself some time, effort, and money and get an iPod instead."
2,Not so great...,"Most of the pages in this book are a drab black & white print, with a few (emphasis on few) pages in the middle that are glossy, full-color. I was thinking ""coffee table book"" when I bought it, but it's definitely not that fancy. I sent it back."
1,POS,"You'll notice the first of many problems with this computer when you turn it on, as might be expected. The noise output of the fan is on par with a 747 at about 1/4 throttle. I bought this thing for school and used it once in a 90 person lecture hall for about 3 minutes. Everyone in the entire room could hear it. You would think that a fan that loud would keep this beast cool. Nope. If you try to run more than one program at a time, particularly anything with non-static graphics, this mother will shut off due to overheating. I will say this for it though, it continues to run after 5 years. That may be just to spite me though."
3,Finally!!,"I was so excited that someone finally released CD versions of Juice Newton's music. Can't Wait All Night wasn't the huge hit that her earlier offerings were, but there's plenty on here to get excited about. First and foremost is the lead off cut, and first single ""A Little Love"", a poppy rock gem that is my all time favorite Juice Newton single and should've been a much bigger hit.Her cover of Bryan Adams' ""Can't Wait All Night"" and ""Easy Way Out"" are two more rocking tunes that make the album stand out on its own. Of course Juice's voice is in full form on the ballads as well and though someone else commented on her cover of ""You Don't Know Me"", I personally like it and find it to be one of the better renditions of the oft covered song.Again, the album as a whole isn't as strong as some of her previous and her next few albums but it is a welcome addtion to the Juice Newton catalog if not just to have those songs mentioned finally on CD."
3,Lack Luster Bulbs - Do not last long in my opinion,"I ordered a bulk order of these bulbs a few months ago. I'd say around 15% came DOA, and another 30% burned out after about 200-1000 hours of use.In the future, I will be buying my MR-16s from a different manufacturer as I feel these Intermatic bulbs fall short of their expectations."
3,The Cynic by Elizabeth Michaels (Harlequin Regency Softcover),"Description from the book back cover:He had never thought to meet his match in a woman! Miss Meg Sutton was the wealthiest debutante to come to Town for some time. She did not lack for instant admirers from amongst the best Society had to offer. This did not, however, include Lord Wrendale, dubbed ""The Cynic"" for his jaundiced view of The Marriage Mart and his pledge to remain in single blessedness forever. He had never looked to meet such a one as Meg, whose own disparaging sentiments toward holy matrimony proved a challenge too unique for even the most seasoned of cynics!"
5,"Witty, urbane and wonderfully engaging!",This book offers the ultimate child-parent reading experience. _Pugdog_ is about dogs and people and how we tend to treat pets from a perspective that is based on and limited to our preconceived ideas and stereotypes.The book teaches wonderful lessons about individualism and love. --Subjects that kids get immediately. I've read it to my niece and nephew countless times and they absolutely adore the book. I've had to buy them each a copy to keep them happy. What's better is that I enjoy it every time I read it because it's so smart and funny. The illustrations are fabulous and hilarious.This is wonderful for young school aged children (ages 6-7) and older school age children (10-12).
5,great!,Im 13 & am getting into puberty. This underwear helps alot in school because I get sudden erections. One time in gym we were changing and I looked at another guy and got one and thanks to these briefs they hid it so no one saw it. Also their a big hit with your boyfriend to cause my bf loves it and he wears them for the same reason.
5,The Hormone of Desire,"Thank you so very much for writing this book and getting the word out to all of us! I sincerely thought that the symptoms that were gradually emerging and causing a negative effect on the quality of my life were a 'normal' part of aging. I was wrong! After reading the book and highlighting the parts that I felt pertained to me, I leant it to my doctor. After reading it, he agreed to try testosterone replacement therapy. I feel like a new woman and my husband is going to send my doctor flowers!"
3,Book: The Hormone of Desire,"Purchased this book thinking it had some kind of magical words that would help me through my total hysterectomy. But, all I found were recommendations about things I already knew. Would recommend this to anyone who was thrown into a total hysterectomy without enough time to do some research on what to expect."
5,Everything in the picture,"The parking break kit comes semi-complete with everything you see in the picture. Don't understand why one piece is missing for a complete kit, but there is. The parking brake kit was easy to install and it was a perfect fit for my 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix. The kit even comes with two packets of grease to repack the piston assembly, so I was able to complete the brake job without having to go to the loacal auto-parts store."
5,Phil Ochs is truly inspired!,This music is an incredible display of insight into many parts of life and thought. Top ratings!!
2,Not Particularly Good,"The plot for the Story had great possibilities, which, unfortunately, were not utilised. The characters were wooden,as was a lot of the dialogue. Apart from that, having dutyfully ploughed through the book, the ending was like a damp squib, it fizzled out.This was downloaded from Amazon"
5,Speading made easy,This broadcast spreader came recommended to me and now I am recommeding it to you. I used it to spead fertilizer and seed on my hunting property. It is wasy to install and very easy to operate. I mounted it to the back of my atv and it worked perfectly!
1,I wouldn't recommend it...,"I bought this because I read great reviews on it on Xyience's page, but I was less than impressed. I took it for a week and a half before I stopped taking it because it made me feel so tired and sluggish. It definitely did not provide any energy boost and did not promote weight loss."
5,A remarkable journey,"One hundred twenty days after he pushed out of Fairbanks, Alaska-in his wheelchair-he arrived in Washington, D.C. An incredible 5600 miles by hand!Injured seven years earlier in a motorcycle accident in Calgary, Alberta, King is a paraplegic with a will that defies the reasonable.But his road through therapy, his struggle to accept his limitation, and his 5600-mile trip through summer's heat and humidity required persistent fortitude. He tells about it openly and poignantly in this personal story."
3,Where's Wu-Tang?,"A friend of mine gave me this movie since he found it on the streets. I know the band Wu-tang clan and I appreciate kung fu movies, so I was delighted to see that some rap band had something to do with a random Hong Kong action movie.The fights where fantastic, and i learned afterwards that jackie chan was the choreographer of all those very long lasting scenes. Everything seems to be like a comic dance."
4,Third one is a charm,"It's clear that Mark Nelson's collaboration with Stars of the Lid's Adam Wiltzie on the Aix Em Klemm cd has been influential. Moodier than the debut or ""360 Bypass,"" ""River"" has a much more ambient feel to it. That's not to say it isn't full of those wonderful Nelson electronic burps and chirps, but the guitar is more subdued and the jazz influence is less prominent. If you're already a Pan American fan, you will buy this anyway; if you're a Labradford fan testing the waters, start with the other two discs, as this is more challenging. If you like SOL, this will be right up your alley. Repeated listenings will reveal it to be as lush and satisfying as his other works, however, and in my opinion, Nelson is the absolute master of whatever you want to call this kind of music."
1,Bad News -- You Don't Get to Hear the Bad News,"If you are considering downloading the Mp3, please beware that the digital copy truncates Micala's climactic dramatic moment. You hear her tell Don Jose that she has something to tell him and that it will be her final word. Unfortunately, the music stops at that point and you don't get to hear the sorrowful news, nor Don José's reaction:'MicalaTa mère, hélas!' ta mère se meurt... et ta mère' ne voudrait pas mourir sans t'avoir pardonné!'José'Ma mère! elle se meurt!'Micala'Oui, Don José!'José'Partons! ah! partons!('À Carmen') Sois contente... je pars... mais... nous nous reverrons!Licia Albanese's stunning performance is the main reason to buy this recording. The missing moments are operatic tragedy indeed! Four stars for the performance, one for the sad state of the digital file!"
5,Georges Bizet: Carmen (Complete Recording),"While I have, what I consider to be the best recording of this wonderful Opera I am, nevertheless a bit puzzled. Amazon sells it in three acts, when in fact there are four. Why they would combine acts three and four into one is a mystery to me. I have in my collection the original LP box set of the opera which is split into four complete acts. Hummm.Nevertheless, I my mind it still remains the opera by which others can be measured. As one other reviewer observed Fritz Reiner is, with out a doubt, one of the finest conductors of his day along with Sir George Solti, Otto Klemperer and others.For those wishing to further enhance their operatic collection they may wish to consider obtaining copies of ""The Marriage of Figaro"" and, of course, ""La bohème"". By the way, as some claim, Rise Stevens passed-away at age 101! If this is indeed accurate it's amazing."
1,Bring on the coffee,"This is a book that I ""needed"" for class. I bought it used to save a buck. the book was in very good shape and on time. For me, this book isnt what I call an ""easy read"". Very dry, but informative. If you are tired dont read it because you might wake up and wonder just what you read. Sorry, it wasnt my choice. TOO DRY FOR ME."
3,Invisible Cards,"These cards are very durable, and somewhat of a novelty. I enjoy them, but the colors are too dull. The red and white could be more vibrant, and the black is not dark enough. I play with them quite often, but I probably wouldn't have chosen them if I saw a real pack of them first (only because of the dull colors). Also, there is a mark on the back of the Queen of Clubs. It's possible that I just happened to get a bum deck."
3,Novelty but don't expect to be quick on the draw.,"I bought a deck of these cards in high school when playing cards games was a thing in between classes or before school started. They were a hit, but since we played on the only hard, flat surface around (cement) they got scratched to the point that they weren't 'invisible' anymore. They were also pretty slippery. When playing games like 'speed' it was pretty hard to be quick on the draw. I still have them so they aren't that bad of a purchase."
3,"Good, but by far not what it could have been","This book has a lot of very cool ideas, but the writer just doesn't have te ability to write great characters enough to pull it off. I realize we don't usually read Mack Bolan books for teir characterization, but I at least want a villain who I hate. There's a great ""show of power"" that I won't spoil for you, but the author favors tactic explanation over getting us more involved with some compelling characterization. As it stands, the ""bad-guys-try-something-and-are-thwarted-by-Bolan-so-they-try-something-else-and-are-thwarted-again-etc.-etc."" thing gets old after a while, and it's too bad, because the whole Hydra thing sounds very intriguing. I'll read the other two boks in the triogy, but if they're more of the same, I fear it will have a good moment or two but ultimately leave me unsatisfied."
2,Where's the sole?,"I've had these shoes for only six months and already worn off the cute little nubbins on the soles. I am not usually hard on my shoes, they will last a least a few years, but these ones might not make it to a year.They are comfy to wear, and cute as all get out. But, they just aren't built to last for even moderate wear."
3,Great in Everything but Really Hot Weather,"I wore this shoe without socks all spring and found it to be terrific. It was great with all the rain we have had and still looks great. I just returned from NYC where the weather was really hot and humid. To my complete surprise, after just a few blocks my heel was ripped to shreds. The nubuck is just too warm to let the foot breathe. I still love them, but will put them away until fall."
5,Loved It!!! Based on a true story!,"The author, Robert Saniscalchi, writes about Vietnam from a perspective that really places the reader inside a young soldier's mind. The fact that the narrator is based on a real true story really makes the story a standout among so many Vietman stories. The book contain enough technical military background on Vietnam warfare to maintain credibility without alienating the reader. I found it compelling, heart-warming, and action-packed."
5,It does Mean Something,"I purchased this CD at a store where you could listen to one track. I don't even remember which one it was, but I was hooked. She as a soothing voice and her songs are great to sing along to. I also like the meaning behind her songs. The song ""Weight Of The World"" makes you think of how as a whole we are all putting to much pressure on ourselves and how we are missing out on a lot fun. The songs are plain and simply uplifting and make my ride to and from work, so much more enjoyable. I plan on purchasing her other albums and have recommended it to many people. I couldn't believe when I rented ""How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days"" and there were several of the songs. Another reviewer said that is was for a Julia Roberts movie and that is why one of the songs is called Julia. I don't believe that is the connection, because Julia Roberts wasn't in ""How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days."""
4,Not just another beautiful face,"Ok, I'll admit it first, I have not yet listened to the entire album yet. I came across Chantal back when ""Armageddon"" came out and she covered 'Leaving on A Jet Plane'. It wasn't til this past week that I began listening to her more. She was on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" a few night ago preforming 'In This Life'. Her appearance had changed greatly since last time I saw her but her vocals were powerful and enchanting. After hearing the song live I checked out the studio version and amazingly her vocals were the same. When an artist can pull off studio vocals live they deserve a recommendation. I will definately pick up this album. It is worth it. I promise you won't be disappointed."
5,Ugh. Disgustingly Beautiful,"I can't get over how gorgeous this album is, the melodies, the lyrics, Chantal's raw & sweet voice that sings with so much passion.I can't stop listening to this album! I'm so glad i stumbled upon Chantal. She's the real deal when it comes to being an artist.My top 51. Feels Like Home2. Morning Light3. Time4. Waiting5. Ready For Your LoveGet this album if you can!"
5,Purchase new but never used,"This book has 16 Full-Size patterns for 16"" Lamps, 11 with straight cuts only. You can reduce or enlarge patterns for 12"" thru 20"" lamps. Step by step illustrated instructions. No lampforms needed."
4,Great Pilates Video- Fair Yoga Video,"I just purchased this video. I really liked part 1 which is only pilates (part 2 combines both yoga and pilates). Part 1 has a good pace which allows you enough time to complete the exercises. Part 2, however, seems to speed through the exercises a little bit too fast for my taste. I own several yoga videos which are strictly yoga and I enjoy them better. However, I cannot stress enough how much I like Part 1. She did a great job and I really, really can feel the ab workout that it provides! Again, however, she includes a lengthy introduction before she gets into part 1 of the tape--it would have been much better to put it at the end because you are left fast forwarding it everytime. Overall, I would recommend this video to my friends. Parts 1 and 2 make a great workout and really strengthen and tone your abs."
5,Denise Austin is wonderful,"I also was a ballet and modern dancer for 25 yrs. before I had my two children. In the Graham classes we did Pilates, and I had a incredibly strong abdomen. I had two children a yr. apart when I was 32, and thought I would bounce back. I did Denise's classes on ESPN back in 1988. I was so pleased to find she had put out her first video using Pilates. I do it every day, and just received the next video. She is extremely encouraging. I do not find her ""chatty"", and resent the fact that someone views her that way. She knows how to talk, explain and keep a class moving. She's an expert at it. Thanks Denise. I appreciate you.Deborah Forbeck"
3,very good but not great,"I use this video about one or twice every two weeks to vary my running schedule and get a deep stretch. It has been my first introduction to Pilates but not to yoga. The first 20 minutes, which is all mat pilates, I find the best. The workout never seems too difficult but I am always soar the next day, especially in my abs. If only this half were a bit longer I'd be much happier.The second half which is all yoga I find to be rushed and without any explaination. I've practiced yoga for many years off and on and to me it seems as though Denise is trying to fit way too much yoga of varying levels into very little time.If you're interested in Pilates but are not advanced in it then check this video out. If you're more into yoga don't rely on this to be a great workout for you."
2,Very Disappointed,"After 5 years of practicing yoga, I decided to give pilates a try. I have to admit that my first experience practing pilates using Denise Austin's video were disappointing. This video is not for a full body workout. The emphasis was placed mostly on the abs. For a serious yoga student, that is not the goal. I was looking for a total mind and body workout. If you're looking for a quick routine to work your abs, this is the workout for you. The 2nd mat workout with yoga was pretty horrible. The poses moved too quickly and were poorly explained. Calling it yoga must be a joke!"
1,The Pilates Challenge.,"I challenge Denise Austin to take a Pilates session from me.Sincerely,Darien GoldStudio Darien"
2,annoying,"Denise has a high whispery and very annoying voice. Therefore, it makes it very hard for me to work out with her. Also, she moves a little too fast, with too few repetitions on the moderate exercises, and too many on the way too hard exercises. Not that good."
3,Not original hit recordings,"Whittaker's voice is great, but a principal reason one buys a greatest hits album is to reminisce with the original recordings. These are not the original hit recordings. I wish buyers could be alerted to facts like this in the descriptions of albums. Anyway, I never listen to this cd as I'm always annoyed that I was tricked into buying it."
2,"Great for theatre costumes, not for historic recreators","This book is very nice if your goal is creating theatrical costumes. There is very little for the serious costumer. The book is written at a very high level, with emphasis on creating something that looks like the period costume, rather than accurately recreating a historic costume."
5,A Rare Gem,Not often does an album of this calibre come along. Every song is so good that it almost sounds familiar the first time you hear it.
2,Looking for Mission or Passion? Keep waiting.,"I bought this expecting it to be another landmark Peter Gabriel soundtrack, on par with Passion/Last Temptation or Birdy. But it wasn't meant to be.Unfortunately many of the songs are over-produced remixes of songs already found on Up, Gabriel's latest studio album (which I do enjoy). And that's too bad -- it's a misuse of the amazing talents of Gabriel's back-up help, the Blind Boys of Alabama, who appear on both albums but are singing the same song(s) on both. Probably even the same cuts. Which is what makes this album feel so unoriginal...If you already own Up, and then buy this one, you're making a mistake. It's an uninspired, falsely dramatic soundtrack."
5,You can not go wrong...,The lyrics are abstract but interpretable... In other words there can be sense made based on each persons personal experience... Thus making it a deeply inspiring experience for the listener... There is no reason not to own this masterpiece.... Good music is too hard to find...
2,You are happy with your Orientalism???,"I am surprised that so many people are easily satisfied by the simplified guidebook to China. The American people (including the scholars) are easily fed. This book is OK: very journalistic, though containing many errors. But it is bizarre that many people even consider using it as a textbook. An alarming signal of the education in U$A. Do you think it is so easy to understand China? Please do more hard work."
5,a masterpiece of the track!!!!!,"This was the first game I had and the most played one Iv'e got I love it it has everything graphics, play ability and good music. its gaming bliss. for racers and non racers alike fans of wipeout for the playstation and games like tony hawks 2 will love it one word to describe it is BRILLIANT!!!!!!!"
3,"Great visuals, Gameplay is lacking..",This game looks great! However it is the first Dreamcast game I have played where you actually sit there and think about the loading time.. The racing part is Very Intuitive.. you will pick up the controls quickly. However the first time you reach a Trick Bowl.. (Think Empty simming pool) you will be totally lost. The instruction manual gives you no indication of how to do tricks. And the in game training only teaches you how to do about 5. You will find your self beating on your controller trying to get your boarder to do something other than a 360.. The first bowl you come to requires 15000 points to clear.. The first 30 times you play it you may be able to get 5000 points..This games looks great as I said before.. But ultimately ends up being too frustrating..Look for a lot of these to be previously owned at most software stores..
1,Terrible game!,"This game is total trash. Avoid it like the plague. The frame-rates are terrible, the control is sloppy, and the game is no fun. Parents shopping for their kids should avoid this one! The only good thing about this game is the music, which isn't saying much. Don't listen to the hype or the person who gave this trash 5 stars, this game is a waste of money! There are so many quality titles coming out for DC, don't bother with this garbage."
4,"Very Good, Great introduction to the subject.","A very good book, breaking down the concepts behind that hunk of silicon sitting on your desktop. While I'm sure there are books that go into more technical detail, this is a great intorduction to the topic."
4,Very Attractive Modern-Instrument Performance,"This is a very attractive modern-instrument performance of these three delightful works. The Salve Regina attributed to Scarlatti is the richest and finest work here, more complex and more interesting than the well-known Pergolesi Stabat Mater, which seems merely pleasant but facile by comparison. It was a pleasure hearing this work. Despite good work from Dutoit and Anderson, this is very much Bartoli's disc--she gives it whatever true distinction it can claim. Her timbre is more individual than Anderson's and her stylistic understanding of this repertory exceed's Anderson's more generalized vocalizing. This disc is a fine addition to any discography not already well-stuffed with the Pergolesi piece, and the Scarlatti is a notable discovery."
5,"Guys, give them a break","If you don't have the rights to an episode, that's just too bad.As far as the quality of volume 1, though, it was THE BEST I've seen yet. I was more happy with volume 1 than all my other copies COMBINED! (I'm trying to collect all 274 episodes.)It looks like we (us collectors) are just going to have to buy from a lot of different companies. I think I got the missing Christmas episode for something like $10... I would recommend the BrentWood version of this since it doesn't appear MPI can produce it. (Amazon sells it under the name of ""Beverly Hillbillies 1"" It has a picture of everyone riding in the old pickup.) It's missing the original intro music, but the quality is great."
4,My Husband Loves It!!,I bought this item for Father's Day for my husband. He loves the old shows. One really neat thing about it is that you get to see all the old commercials built into the show. There are alot of Winston cigarette and Kelloggs cereal commercials. They are really fun to watch.
1,Only Seasons,I think somone at Mpi Media Group is just stupid or don't have a clue of what there doin im going to do the same thing i did with vol.1 not buy it i never buy volumes there junk to me i want compleat seasons. There are to many other season sets i want before i buy this junk.I hope theye get stuck with them and have to sell them in the walmart bin for $5.00 thats what will happen if no one buys them. So people don't buy teach Mpi Media Group a lesson. I did not and won't buy Vol.1 and Vol.2 ill wait for seasons keep them.
4,Eclectic Mix,"A beautiful blend of folk music and modern flavor. From Pavarotti to Paul Simon, the listener is treated to an eclectic mix of music that is a refreshing break from the pre-pubescent pop/rock sound of today's mainstream music."
4,A fun chick read!,"This is not a deep literary work of genius, but it is a fun, engaging read. It's not horribly complicated, so it is ideal for the busy woman who doesn't have time to read daily religiously, but needs to be able to pick it up without having to backtrack through the book to get reacquainted with what happened the last time she left off. The characters are like friends we all have and love, as well as those we put up with just because we've known them forever. The long time childhood friends are all at different stages of their lives, there are a couple of twists & turns. All in all a fun, worthwhile read.If you liked the Briget Jones's series, Lisa Jewel's books, Jane Green's books, the Shopaholic series, and the likes of that genre, this will be right up your alley."
5,One of The Best Folkrock Albums Ever,"Delicate and melodic baroque soft-rock with a mellow hippie aura. Vocally not unlike the softer moments of the Peanut Butter Conspiracy or Comfortable Chair. Where they came from is unknown, though some of the credits hint at it being recorded in New York City. To be taken in the drawing-room with perfumed tea."
5,Took Me Years To Find This,"I first heard of Michaelangelo via a local easy listening AM station which played the instrumental ""300 Watt Music Box"". The quest to find a copy took me nearly 10 years and led to my becoming a record collector. I recall paying $10 for a mint 45 rpm, backed with another instrumental track ""Half a Tap"". This, to me, sounds like the quintessential ""sign-off"" tune for a radio or TV show. I later located the LP. Frankly, the hippie-era lyrics seem outdated, but the instrumental tracks still remain among my all-time favorites. I was glad to obtain a CD with much clearer sound than my old vinyl discs. Think of the vocals as history and the instrumentals as forever."
2,Where'd the copper go?,We got a couple of these awhile back and were planning on getting some more to line the path to our front door. We put them in on the east side of the house so they get full sun in the morning. Well they hardly ever light up and now the finish is almost completely worn off. They look awful. We're really glad we didn't get ten of them.
2,Nice look for a poor product,"These look nice and feel like they would be a great product. I bought one set and neither would light. The company customer service is great, they replaced both lights quickly. Still not much luck, one lights and not for very long it will not hold a charge. The other comes on dimly for only a little while."
4,Acid Mothers Temple & Melting Paraiso - 'In C' (Squealer),"Nicely assembled Acid Mothers Temple digipack release of their lengthy catalog. Three tracks for you to mentally absorb here. ""In C"" (20:31) is an apparently remake of the Terry Riley minimalism classic, ""In E"" (16:30) is a decent Acid Mothers improvisation piece to HOPEFULLY cause more than the usual amount of expected brain damage and ""In D"" (19:47) is what I assume to be a lengthy jam, thus penned by ATM guitarist Kawabata Makoto. Very good, Recommended, if you're a true Acid Mothers fan. Enjoy."
5,A great tool to enhance your Palm V or VII,"This is an exellant keyboard fot the Palm. Especially if you travel a lot. And, it can also double as a crade so that you can charge the orginizer with it and hotsync with it. I recommed it for any Palm user."
1,Don't Trust Amazon Reccomendation!!,"I grabbed this after getting the Raising Chickens book by the same author. Amazon reccomended this book after I purchased the raising chickens bookm and since I planned on building a coop, I figured this information, along with the raising chickens book would be enough. But, much to my dismay, this Bulletin is more of an exerpt of the book. All the same information is covered in a chapter of the book. Don't waste your money on this at all if you get the other book."
5,Very good,I have a couple of other books by Gail Damerow and this is basically excerpts from them but the info is useful and it is like a quick reference guide when constructing a basic structure for your chickens. I used this info when I was designing the coop that we are building this weekend.
2,Basically an exerpt from another book.,"I ordered this book along with Storey's Guide to Raising Chickens: Care/Feeding/Facilities. Both books are written/edited or whatever by Damerow. I was hoping to get a variety of design ideas from the different books, but this Storey Wisdom book is basically just an exerpt from the larger Raising Chickens book...word for word in many (if not all) instances. Save your money and buy the larger book."
1,Not jazz as I know it,"By all means, buy this album if you like little girl voices. Lisa bluffs her way through these standards in a pseudo-sexy, Swedish-accented, Marilyn Monroe-ish way ... but never for a moment convinces me she is singing jazz. Just listen to the sound clip of ""Boy Next Door"" to hear how she doesn't cut pitching the #4 of the chord (on the words ""ignore"" and ""next door""). Not that pitch is everything ... But she just doesn't inhabit the songs (I don't believe her) - especially ""Love for Sale"" and ""Lush Life"". I think she'd do better sticking to material she can musically handle. There are too many artists intent on tackling the repertoire of standards and doing an unconvincing job of it."
4,kind of silly but cute,ok so we made one of them throw up...you have to be carefull not to turn them to much or they get sick..to funny!cute but does not hold kids interest to long.
5,Excelente opcion,"Es un buen producto, grande, pesado, excelente para realizar labores de picado de vegetales en la cocina. Producto recomendado 100%, mango de buena calidad, hoja tambien!"
5,Great Read!,"Judith McNaught does it again! I really enjoyed Double Standards. Even though the story was short, when compared to her other books, it was still complete and not lacking anything. I feel like as a reader I got to know the characters pretty well and felt comfortable with everything. If you are in for a short read by a GREAT author, I highly recommend this book."
3,Mario's Big Break,"This is a surprisingly thoughtful movie about a flawed, but decent young man torn between the life of easy money and upward mobility that a mob boss offers him or staying true to the impoverished community where he came from. Mario Lopez gives a very well-acted performance in what should be a star-making role for him. He also demonstrates the kind of charisma and physical presence to be an action hero in feature films. Hollywood producers should take note."
3,Good while it lasted.,I bought this unit and it worked great for about a month. Thank goodness I bought an extended service plan. It started having what looked like signal disruption lines going through the pictures. I would click stop and then play gain and it would be fine for a little while. It also began sticking on the subtitles. The movie would go on with the subtitles still stuck at the previous clips. The last thing it started doing was moving very slow frame by frame on its own. I would have to forward it to get past it. These were brand new DVDs that played fine on my cheap $40 player. I took it back and would have been happy trying another but the store was out of stock and the item is discontinued so they offered me a Panasonic DMR-ES35V. So far so good with this one. It's working great and the remote is a lot easier to use.
1,Terrible. Cost too much. Stuck with it.,I bought this to copy VHS to DVD. I thought is was high quality because it cost so much. VHS player is terrible quality. So I don't use it for that. It finalizes recordings for half an hour. I'm stuck with it. I won't buy Sony again because I feel ripped off. DVD fast-forward and rewind is ridiculously slow.
1,Complete self destruct...,"The unit is beautiful. The setup seems simple and the quality of Sony places a lot of credibility on the unit's performance. However, within six days of operation, the DVD system shut down and would not run at all. There was no sound from the VHS, although a picture was visible. I can not recommend this product at all."
2,It covers the reciever badly.,"Save yourself the trouble and buy a two piece base. It looks terrible and makes it tough to clean. Amazon thinks I need to write more words here to complete the review, so I am."
2,Oldfield dvd finally!,"I've been a huge fan of Oldfield since the original Tubular Bells. This show is a New years eve affair shot in Berlin 2000. Mike looks cold and unhappy.The first half includes mediocre versions of his ""classic"" work, while the second half is new stuff (""new-agey"" new stuff). The Art in Heaven piece is pretty good.What Mike needs to do now in his career is release some dvd of his great shows from the 70's and 80's, material that's been circulated on ... bootlegs for years. This would really please his fans and hopefully inspire him to write some new music...let's face it, his last good work was Tubular Bells 2, way back in 1992!"
4,Good introduction to Slow Cooking,This book has a large collection of easy recipes for slow cookers. I especially like the Borscht and Meatloaf recipes.
2,Poor Choice for Me,"I chose this to support a 42"" flatscreen TV that would have to be angle-adjusted for viewing, hence the 'must-have' swivel top feature. Not far into the stand's assembly I realized that the top section was double-layers of the same footprint shape, the two separated by a crude swivel mechanism. To angle a TV you would have to swivel the full-size table top, but with the stand placed against a room wall (as they normally are) the end of the table top would hit the wall before the TV angled to any useful degree. The double top also made the total stand insanely heavy - over 70 lbs. of compressed fiberboard and glass panels - but I believe the finished stand would be a very durable piece. Not the right one for me though; I abandoned the project and gave it to a relative."
5,2-Stroke Glow Engines,"Very well written, good basic illustrations. Good read for beginners or seasoned hobbyist. Would highly recommend to anyone who plays with glow engines."
1,Terrible!,Terrible game......just the same game as RE four years ago with nice graphics....stupid game it's just about killing it's terrible! DONT BUY!
2,Worst Control Ever,"I will agree that this game has probably the best graphics I've ever seen, but that can't make up for the control you have. It is almost impossible at times to fight anyone or anything and you usually just end up dead or dying. I guess I was spoiled from playing Shadow Man which is the best Sega Dreamcast game to date. The only reason this gets two stars is because of the graphics...because game control sucks monkeys. I read all the reviews on this game and I was totally psyched to get it in the mail but then was quickly disappointed. Don't waste your money."
3,Frustration Frustration,"First off the positives: The game has great graphics and interesting puzzles. It stops there.Now, I'll slam it. The user intereface is terrible. The controls are clumbsy and slow at times. The inventory list usage is awkward. The movement of the character is also slow and clumbsy. Getting past the first attack proved difficult until the movement of the character was loosely mastered and found the character's slow movement extremely frustrating. This is not a game for the easily frustrated. I wanted to throw the controller at the television."
3,"""Good Day"" Good But Not Great","This is a lovely, laid back album that soothes without surprising. Molaskey offers straight-forward, no frills vocals that at times (particularly in a flat, perfunctory ""Small World"") can seem devoid of character. The oldies are well-chosen and obviously dear to Molaskey's heart; the new tunes written with her husband John Pizzarelli stand up to them impressively. (A few of them are outright wonderful.) I'll definitely have ""A Good Day"" on the stereo now and then, but it won't take the place of my Monheit and Krall CDs."
5,San Diego Gardner,"What an excellent Book! I never thought that a gardening method could make such a difference...but I can see that it does. I am very anxious to try this new method this season. I am looking forward to gardening with no weeds, no bending over, in fantastic soil that my plants will thrive on. Lynn's book is very complete, showing all that you need to have a successful garden this year. She cover everything from construction, to planting guides, and pests. I like that she includes cost for everything that you would need...no surprises. I can also in-vision how gardening with the cinder block method can create a very beautiful looking garden so not only good for your health but pleasing to your eyes (and the envy of all your neighbors)! Her approach and style of writing is very easy to understand, moves right along, and is quite humorous. I recommend this book to everyone I know that is growing a vegetable garden. It makes a great gift too. Can't wait to get started! Thanks!"
2,Gunvault GV2000C-DLX,"First off the product is fine but the customer service stinks! I had problems setting the combination due to a step missing from the instructions. I called and held, and held, and held and then held some-more and finally got a ""person"" to answer the phone. Once I was able to talk to someone she ""put me on hold"" and my call was never answered again. I finally figured it out after many many tries and go the combo set.So, the product is fine but the customer service is terrible and I am not sure I would recommend the product to anyone else or purchase another one from them. GOOD LUCK!"
5,GREAT SAFE,"After calling the company and making a minor adjustment to the latch, works perfectly. High grade steel and very secure."
5,Colm is the best there is,"I can't agree more with those who stated their regret that Colm has not produced more albums. It is almost inconceivable to me that a voice like his isn't available in a dozen different CD's. I listen to this one over and over again and he still has the power to move me to tears when he sings ""Bring Him Home."" Somebody please do something--let's get this man to record more music!"
4,Great gadget,"I bought this item for my son so that he could listen to his Ipod in his car. I gave it to him for Christmas, he istalled and said he loved it. It apparently works really well, so I bought a 2nd unit for my kid brother."
1,Did nt work for me.,"The product arrived on time. However, the quality was not good at all. I have used a similar one ( diff brand) before and I know that the sound quality is never crystal clear. However, this particular piece gave so much noise that I was never able to use it. I tried to tune it to many empty stations, even the ones that worked with my previous transmitter did nt work with this one. I have returned it."
3,REMOTE CONTROL DOESN'T WORKKK,I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS ITEM IS OK. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE COSTUMER SERVICE. I TRY TO GET A REPLACEMENT OF THE CONTROL... I NEVER GOT A RESPONSE FROM THIS SELLER...
2,Static-itis,Daughter thrilled to get for her car but it only worked one day. Cannot get clear radio stations. I am returning!!!!!!!!!!!
5,This works wonderfully!!!,"I will recommeded to anyone who needs one. I was debating between the Apple version and this one, and I'm glad I chose this one."
4,Pretty Good Device,I bought it through Amazon.It's a good and cheap solution.Might be problematic in area with crowded radio stations.One problem though - it doesn't save the last station you used so you need to set it everytime you use it.
2,6 in 1 car kit for ipod,"This is item is not the best.. it has a lot of static & the ipod touch doesn't stay in the grip... I would not purchase this item again or recommend it to anyone. also, the part that goes in the lighter came apart.... this is the second one that I have ordered from you and neither one is worth the money I paid.......this is the only product from Amazon that I am disappointed in..thank you"
4,Saetechi excellent service,"FM transmitter works pretty well, relatively minimal feedback. Remote isn't the most sensitive so have to hold it considerably close to transmitter to get it to work properly but otherwise whole product works really well. Customer service was excellent (my first one didn't have a working remote and they were excellent in following up and getting me a new one in a very timely manner."
2,"Bad product, good customer service.","I was not impressed with this product at all. It made all the songs on my iPod Touch 2G sound like an out of tune radio station, no matter what frequency I had it set to. The remote works if you point it directly at the unit, otherwise it doesn't, and the gear that's supposed to prevent the unit from tilting, doesn't. The part that is inserted into the cigarette lighter was broken out of the box, and the whole thing felt clunky. I returned it, and the customer service was pretty good.I'm really surprised at how many good ratings this thing got. Maybe most people don't mind static, and distorted highs when listening to music?"
4,Good,Got rid of Sat radio and decided to use my ipod. Picked the 6 in 1 Car Kit based on reviews.Easy to set up and worked without effort. Selecting FM stations a snap. Remote works most of the time. I think it could be my ipod that does not respond to some of the button selections.Only complaint. Engine noise from my 2006 Subaru. Was not present on the Sat radio at same frequency. Tried other freqs but still a faint noise.Overall evaluation: I'd still by it.
1,piece of junk,i got it in the mail and it didn't work right away it would not turn on when i plugged it into the cigarette lighter it would not do anything and i tried it in 4 different cars and it would not turn on it just sat there and the little screen would not turn on. WORST THING EVER PIECE OF JUNK DO NOT BUY IT WILL NOT WORK
4,Hmmm,I have not finished this book yet but so far its been great. I love canning my kills great eating. I picked through the book to get the info I needed. I recommend this book.
2,canning freezing...,Not anything new or better in this book. This book has a lot of usless fluff. If you know nothing it may help some.
3,safety first...,"too much emphasis on what the federal government deems as necessary safety. it's important to be safe especially with meats, but several things work well to preserve foods."
4,Really a good book to have.,This book gave me pointers on everything I needed to know. I learned a bunch of new things. I have recommended it to several friends.
4,GREAT BOOK,This is a really good book to have on hand. It has a lot of really nice recipes and it is very easy to read. The directions are very clear and well written.
4,Detailed and interesting - should come with a large pressure cooker,I really enjoyed this book. Lots of detail and pictures. Dont buy materials until after you have read the book. A large pressure cooker that holds standard size glass is the way to go for canning otherwise the process is much longer than need be.
2,Great idea ruined by too much salt and MSG,"I like Knorr products and have used them for many years. I just wish they would reformulate them to cut out the MSG and reduce the salt. These little cubes, which are a great idea, have 750 mg of salt in each one. That's basically the entire cube! They do have a nice onion flavor, but I'm not sure even that is natural onion flavor.Instead of these little cubes, I suggest McCormick's range of MSG and salt free seasonings (found here on Amazon, some with free super-saver shipping). They come in large containers at a great price, and are a better choice for healthy cooking."
1,"We want the full movie, not bits of it.","When I heard that a lots of parts were cut, I got very upset. I wish I could find the whole story. I saw the original in French and I just want to share it with my English friends.This is the best romantic movie I ever seen and if all the parts were included in this video, I would buy it in a heart beat.Please make the full version in English."
4,know what you're buying,"This book has tons of chords with tons of variations for each. However, you should know what you're getting before you buy it. This is NOT a chord progession book. It will not tell you how to use the chords. If you already know what chords you want to play, this book will help you find possible variations."
4,Good,This was purchased for a friend. He walks around with the book every chance he gets and has nothing but good things to say about the book.
1,Why did they or I bother?,"The review title says it all.Sorry for not being particularly 'helpful', but if you don't buy it or have the misfortune of being inflicted with it as a gift, then my work here is done. David is a wonderful person and this is almost criminal Gillian. OK i'm not wasting anymore time on this garbage."
4,David Helgott...,"I must admit that I am one of those people that, until I went to see the movie ""Shine,"" I too was ignorant about Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 3. After viewing the movie, I went and bought the Soundtrack. In itself, I didn't find it very special. But, it whetted my appetite for more, and I went and purchased his 1996 performance of the Piano Concerto. Myself, I noticed that yes, he ""muddles"" through parts, and sounds like he is just banging on keys. Furthermore, I purchased (David?) Askenazy's performance of the Concerto, to give me something to compare against Helfgott's performance. Askenazy's performance is nothing short of brilliant. Brilliant phrasing and technique. But, I like Helfgott's performance even more. I can play the entire disc over and over again, and never tire of it. And, I can't explain it...but, again, just 4 stars because there's always room for improvement!"
2,an interesting interpretation,"This is the first recording of Rach 3 I had ever heard, and after listening to it a few times I knew something wasn't right. So I bought other recordings. The cadenza and the climaxes are all bad and confusing, but there are some interesting parts. It's nice to hear different interpretations of those passages where the pianist is given the freedom of rubatto or accelerando(sp?). It's not a very good recording, but it's worth listening to for different ideas if you're interested in this piece."
5,Great follow-up,I really liked this book. Emily Griffin's style of writing is so easy to read and absorb. I really liked how she gave a different characters' perspective while keeping you informed of the former main from the last book. I can't wait for the next one!!!
4,This was unexpected...,"At first, I was so disappointed to learn that Something Blue was not about Rachel. By the end of Something Borrowed, who didn't love Rachel??? I didn't care about Darcy. I didn't much care for Darcy halfway through Something Blue, as a matter of fact.This book was predictable in that you can really see where the story is going fairly early on. What's wholly unexpected is that I would be a believer. I didn't think it was possible to see Darcy as a sympathetic heroine. But then slowly, I started to care. And then care more. And then by the end, I had as much love for Darcy as I did Rachel and felt the story was complete.The message in this story, to me, was: We can never overcome past disappointments if we aren't accountable for the role we played in them. After all, only crazy people keep doing the same thing, over and over, expecting a different result in the end, right?Great message hidden in a great story."
4,Too cute,"Really enjoyed both books, a good distraction from life. looking forward to reading another book by Emily Griffin. i would definitely recommend them."
4,"Ok, so I liked it.","I enjoyed this story as much as 'Borrowed', as both books are page-turners; however, they are page-turners in different ways. During 'Borrowed', your mouth is usually agape due to the shock of what's unfolding...during `Blue', you get to watch Darcy Rhone's transformation. Some reviewers' say it's not believable for Darcy to change `just like that', but what I got was that this person she became is really who she was all along, it just took her some time to become okay with knowing and understanding who she really was. At any rate, I do highly recommend both books. You should definitely read `Borrowed' first, as you really won't fully appreciate `Blue' not having done so."
3,"Blah for ""Something Blue""","As much as I loved ""Something Borrowed,"" this novel fell flat for me. I guess I just never warmed up to Darcy. Her sudden transformation was too ""all of a sudden."" A person as bratty as Darcy, just does not seem to change overnight like this. But, I still like the way the author paints her characters and the story. She did a great job of making me dislike Darcy in the first place."
2,Disappointing sequel,"I am very surprised at the great reviews that this book has received. The entire book seems to be told from the perspective of Rachel is she were to put herself in Darcy's shoes. The character is not believable as an actual person, and definitely did not garner any sympathy from me. Part of the reason the character is not believable is because she seems to have a lot of insight into her actions even at the very beginning. She knows what actions of hers will be unacceptable to the majority of her friends and family. In addition, it was disappointing to read the second chapter, which was pretty much verbatim one of the last chapters in Something Borrowed. Knowing that memory is not something that we can just rewind and play, this part was especially unrealistic and disappointing. I would save your money and instead pick up a book by Sophie Kinsella."
2,I Don't Get the Draw,"Darcy has always been the popular, pretty girl who has it all. Then, weeks before her wedding to Dex, she admits her affair with groomsman Marcus, discovers Dex was cheating with maid of honor Rachel and then finds out she is pregnant. After things with Marcus dissolve, she flees to London to crash with her childhood friend Ethan. With her life in tatters, Darcy is forced to make major life changes and she finds happiness with Ethan, makes amends with Rachel (who marries Dex) and has her twin boys.Although I am all for a story where the pretty girl eats crow, this story was too over-the-top. No one carrying twins would go from a 4 to only a 6 at 5 months along. No one at 30 who spends like Darcy could go for 8 months without working and still buy designer clothing and fly business class to London. Ethan would never fall for Darcy given their history. Someone as selfish as Darcy never would have had the babies in the first place and Marcus was just too stereotypically lame."
3,enjoyable,"I read first ""Something borrowed"" (which I loved) and then immediately bought ""Something blue"" not knowing that I was in for a (sweet) disappointment.I was looking forward to see what happens next in the lives of Darcy, Ethan and Rachel. Without spoilers, what happens next is not that exciting...or should I say it's way too exciting to be realistic. There was too much wishful thinking in the story as a whole, too much character change that was not well reasoned and not in compliance with the way the characters were developed in the first book. Furthermore, the end is way too sugar-coated and in my opinion not at all fair to Rachel and to Ethan. In fact, the end of ""Something blue"" made lame the many insights on friendship and personal space developed in the first book.That said, the story is nevertheless interesting and sweet and the writing is clever, dynamic and witty but also quite balanced."
4,"Light, refreshing, pleasantly surprising read","At first I thought this was a fun, easy summer read. But as Darcy evolves into a more mature woman who finally grows up, I found myself wanting to continue reading. Sweet ending, hated for it to end."
2,Something Missing,"The writing is fine, it's the plot that feels weak. The spoiled, self-centered perfect beauty queen has a ""revelation"" as shallow as she is, enabling her to marry the nice stuggling (though not for long) writer -after getting knocked up and giving birth to 2 illegitimate babies. That's basically all there is to it. Oh yeah, and she lives happily ever after."
5,Sequel Superceeds,Loved this book even more than the first. Can't wait to read more works from this author!
3,Ehh.. not quite Something Borrowed.,"The book is not a BAD book. It is not poorly written nor is it eye gaugingly boring. It just wasnt quite as great as all of the other Emily Giffin books. Something Blue tries to carry on the story of Something Borrowed..and as we all know..most sequels arent a hit! I would have better appreciated this story from a first time author... or someone just getting their feet wet, not an author with as much talent as Emily Giffin, who has written other books that I cant be pryed away from. Again, Def not her best.. but also not the worst of the worst."
5,LOVE this book,"This books is not my typical reading style. However, someone recommended that I read something borrowed and something blue. I enjoyed both books, but I LOVED this book. I love Ms. Griffin writing style and she was able to provide a smooth transition from something borrowed to something blue. Also through her writing she was about to show that yes we all make mistakes and that things can seem completely hopeless but to just continue to do your best and give things your all because you never know what wonderful ending/ beginning is awaiting us in the form of friendship and love."
5,Something Blue,"I LOVED Something Blue! When I started reading the book I was not really happy it was about Darcy. But, after much thought and reading I ended up liking Something Blue so much more than Something borrowed. I also thought, while i was reading, there really was no where else to go with Rachel and Dex anyway. They would be boring!! So, I am so glad to have read Darcy's story and thought it was a wonderful ""Love Story"" with a wonderful ""Happy"" Ending! They are both excellent books and I highly recommend reading them both!"
4,Just a bit better than the prequel,"(same tandem review from ""Something Borrowed""): I actually read this book in tandem with ""Something Borrowed"", and I'm really glad I did. I started out liking Rachel and disliking Darcy (in both novels), but as they progressed I found myself liking Darcy more and more, and getting angrier with Rachel. It's possible that I just appreciated the changes that Darcy made with her approaching motherhood, but I also found myself getting irritated with Rachel's predictable mooning over her ex-best friend's fiancé, and with how she justified sleeping with him by bringing up every little slight she ever suffered from Darcy.In the end, Darcy grew up, prioritized, and kept her colorful personality while becoming a better person. Rachel stayed vanilla and uninteresting."
1,the heroine is MISERABLE,"this book was a quick and easy read, but i was totally annoyed the whole time reading it because the heroine, darcy, is basically intolerable. she's selfish, demanding, a liar, can't take responsibility for her own actions, and extremenly judgemental. she wants to marry four different men in the course of this relatively short book! also, the last third of the book became completely predictable. pass this one up!"
5,Something I couldn't put down!!!,"Something Blue was by far my favorite read for this summer! I honestly couldn't put it down! I read Something Borrowed last summer and truly enjoyed it, but Something Blue was even better! Darcy made me laugh out loud with some of the things she said and even got me annoyed as some points, too. A great story with a great moral. I can't wait to read Baby Proof!"
2,Guide for Starting and Operating An Elderly Residential Care,"If you are looking for a general guide about starting a small business, this may be adequate for you. If poor grammar, misspelled words, and a low quality publication are correlated with content, then this is very poor. Content directly related to the subject is very general and inadequate. Most of the content appears as if it was taken directly from State guidelines and regulations."
2,Useless,"The first 30-35 pages are about Bull and Mini-bull Terriers. The next 120 pages are just general info that can be applied to any breed such as potty training, flea control, exercise, etc. Save your money and read any mini-bull breeder's website FAQ and you will get as much info on mini-bulls as in this 150 page book."
5,Couldn't put it down....,"I read this book in just two sittings and was disappointed for it to be finished. I enjoyed the characters and their dramas and dilemmas. Laura, the realtor and heroine, has her hands full with an amazingly complicated sale and a daughter who is in a heap of trouble. The plot is suspenseful, emotional, and full of surprises. I hope that Ms. Walls will tell more about the lives of these characters in a sequel!"
3,The point is?,"If I had to be simple and brief in my review of this video game, I would say - BORING."
1,Worst Fighting Game Ever,"If you want to have any amout of fun, go pickup Soul Calibur, and leave Power Stone on the shelf. Soul Calibur is to a Ferrari as Power Stone is to a Pinto."
4,great party game,"this is the 2nd most original fighter ive played in a long time behind whatever mario's fighter was called. its a great game to play with a lot of people due to the short matches, simple controls, and relatively low learning curve. nice graphics as well, of course."
5,One of Capcom's Hottest Arcade ports ever!,"This game is great. It's easy to learn, fast and looks buetiful. The more you play it the higher you skill level grow, which means this game has tons of depth. This game has a ton of replay value for those who have a few friends to play it with. The VMS game is good enough to keep you ocuppied until you earn the last extras of the game. The only flaw is that the game tends to lack a few moves, although there is never a lack of things to do. A must have for any Capcom fan."
1,THESE ARE NOT WATERPROOF,"I bought a pair of these for my honeymoon in Costa Rica. The optics and ease of use are fine with these binoculars, but they are certainly not waterproof as the description states. After one rainy trip in the jungle there was water trapped inside of the optics. I even used the lens covers when not using them to help keep them dry."
5,YES!,This item was a definate score for me. The view was clear and it focused nicely. The overall look of the bino's were very good. Also had a nice case.
4,Decent for the money,"Just so people know what actually comes in the box. It came with, a basic neck strap, lens covers, microfiber cloth for cleaning lens, and a pouch that the binos fit in with a shoulder strap and belt loop on it.For the actually binoculars themselves. Not bad for the money, okay light transmission, decent clarity. Not going to confuse them with a nice set of nikons, but for the price, I think overall very respectable.The only think I don't like about them, they are on the heavy side."
3,wire to long,"The wire is to long. Will not cut all the way through. Other than that it's a good unit. A little heavy, but being it is granite, you would expect it to be heavy, Because of the wire I would not purchase this item again."
2,steph1,The cheese cutter is just OK. The cutting wire is too long and therefore wafors when cutting--it should be shorter and tighter.
2,Dishonest Run Time Info...Why Lie?,"As a consumer, I feel cheated because I paid for a video that was advertised as 35 minutes run time, but this DVD & ""Let's Go to the Jungle"" is actually only 23 minutes including beginning & end credits. That's a big difference for such a short video. The 35 minute run time is printed on the DVD jewel case & on the DVD itself. I went on ""kidsmusicalyoga.com"" & sent an e-mail asking for an explanation or even an apology, but my e-mail was ignored.As far as the content of the video, my kids do like it for the songs which are catchy for pre-schoolers. However, I was disappointed by the lack of actual activity/yoga/exercise the video asks of the kids. It's more of a sing-a-long video...I was just expecting more movement.I just want to give other moms a ""heads up"" so you know what you're paying for & aren't disappointed."
2,A little weird,"This video has potential with the catchy original music, but the adults in the video act strangely and seem to talk down to the kids, aaannnd whhhhaaat do yooouuuu seeeeee? There is way too much talking. And they do very few actual poses/moves. The production is very poor - lots of choppy places and clearly repeated sections.If it was just the poses and songs, and more of them, it would be much better."
2,catchy but not really any yoga,"I've owned this for about two years now and am pretty much continually dissapointed with it. My two year girl old finds the music catchy (though my son was three when we bought this and has hated it from the beginning). There isn't really any yoga in the whole video and the the physical exercise is pretty much nill too. At one point 'Fairy Princess Andrianna' does a tree pose but she doesn't explain how to do it or why. The children lay in corpse pose briefly at the end of the movie but again, no explanation on the how or why. Also the 'acting' is truly, truly horrible and tends to distract from any kind of 'message' that they might have otherwise been able to get across. This isn't really worth the money or time...you're probably going to learn more (and get more exercise) from walking about the block and talking about nature than you would from this piece."
5,The Dragon v.s The Wolf,"I gotta say, Rurouni Kenshin just keeps getting better and better with every VHS and DvD release. The dubbing gets better, and the plot thickens, and you just get sucked into the story. First of all, I have got to say Saito Hajime's english voice is very well done, he sounds like the typical ""I dont take any [thing]... from no one."" Also his fighting style is rough, the way he fought Kenshin was something else, and the music just boosted it even more.If you buy this volume, your gonna end up getting the next one, and the one after that, and the one after that."
4,"Twist Turns, but most of all Fight Scenes","In the Shadow of the Wolf, the DVD continues were the show left off on television, up until recently were they have now just passed this DVD. The DVD has some pretty funny outtakes and the Saito VS Kenshin battle is the whole reason for this DVD. This DVD gives you some knowledge of the Meiji era and its leaders. In the special features there is some information about the Meiji era and revolution. This DVD is really good and I recommend it if you have a basic knowledge about Rurouni Kenshin."
3,covers misleading,"I almost didn't get these books due to the covers, figured general HQ read. Was surprised with storyand charactors, enjoyable read."
5,"Lots of fun, nicely developed story","Loved the grounded and determined Midwestern girl focused on retaining her independence and her insurance investigator career. It's easy to imagine being the young Kit, full of spunk and tenacity. Matched against Beau, an old-fashioned southern gentleman (if a bit of a playboy at the moment) who imagines he'll eventually be settling for a Southern Belle wife--not a flighty, if beautiful little con artist, Kit follows her ambitions and instincts and explodes both their tame expectations. Lots of internal debating and struggling before they each cave in for what they really want and need: each other. Enjoyed it."
3,Interesting but Long winded,"Not a bad account of Puerto Rico in the 20-50's. Its one person's life that changes, obviously, through the plantation years of PR to a more industrial way of living. As PR developed, the people started to go outside the box, so to speak. This mentality is still prevelent in a lot of people today. Even with technology, people still live within their island bubble. There were some parts that repeated itself, which made it tough to reread again. Either way, I recommend this book for those who look to uncover the culture anomoly that Puerto Ricans are."
5,"""Lucky"" Purchase","We bought Lucky and had it shipped direct for our almost 2-year old granddaughter. Our son-in-law assembled the horse without any problems. We wanted Lucky because this horse was a little taller than the others, and our granddaughter is tall for her age. However, she's young enough to still require supervision while riding. Our daughter said it was fairly easy to bounce on, and the springs weren't too tight. The shipping was great, it arrived well within the time they estimated. We're all glad we chose this particular horse and would recommend it."
5,Delighted with this product!,"This toy has come a long way from the hard plastic version I had as a child. We love the plush pony and the covers for the springs will save many a pinched leg. I bought this for my 2 year old, but all four of my kids love it (they are all under the 65 pound limit). Once we got past the somewhat difficult assembly, we have been thoroughly delighted with ""Lucky"". I would definitely recommend the Lucky spring horse to anyone with small kids (boys or girls!)"
2,None working,I was not happy with this item becasue when I recived it and put it together all the bottons do not work. It dose not make the sounds.
5,Wonderful book,"The book was absolutely excellent! I got this book as a recommended reference book for my course in digital games and animation, and was bowled over by the book. The concepts in the book are very well-defined, and it really helped me a lot in an animation I am putting together now."
2,Helpful Suggestions,"The book was helpful, but contained much information that was interesting but not directly beneficial to me."
4,Great Binoculars,"Bought these for around the farm. Ended up taking them to the beach with me all summer - they were great for watching porpoises off shore, ships and buoys way out in the water. These were easy for the kids to use as well."
4,"Difficult read, wealth of info","This is one of the most awkwardly worded, difficult to read books I have ever read and the diagrams are not always clear.On the otherhand, it was worth the 6 months it took me to read it. The book is an education on optics with allot of hard to find information that is relevant to all types of photographic and projection systems. It is a good book to have for reference."
2,For completists only,"Unless you have to read everything Faulkner wrote, save your time here. It's better than Soldier's Pay, Mosquitoes, and Sanctuary, but that isn't much to aspire to. Here and there an interesting thought comes up, but if you're short on time or energy, spend it working through Absalom, Absalom! That will save your soul. You can listen to Jagger sing Parachute Woman and get the same material in a better medium. Pylon, however, is a good word."
1,HEEEEEELL NO.,"You gotta be kidding me. He's Representing Watts? I know brotha's down in Watts wouldn't even blast this in their rides. This CD is garbage, pure and simple. Every single song is wack on this thing. Now dont get me wrong, I dont hate the brother. His first album was tight, but this..Throw it out."
3,tyrese wanna be a thug now,if you like tyrese this is for you seems like he's trying to go thug like everybody else now.
5,Elvis Lives,I love it. It was amazing how they put then and now for Elvis' band players together. Excellent show and performance.
4,ALL ELVIS >>> ALL THE TIME!,"I purchased this after a recent trip to Graceland. It is not the premier Elvis DVD, but is a great work of technology (mixing his image w/his band's later performance). We enjoyed it."
5,SUPER GREAT,"I gave this product as a gift and the person I gave it to LOVED IT!!!!Elvis Lives- The 25th Anniversary Concert ""Live"" From Memphis (DVD Jewel Case)"
4,Elvis Lives,Item ws purchased for a gift so I have not actually listened to it. I was pleased to be able to find what she wanted so easily and received it promptly
5,Elvis 25th Anniversary DVD,I waited many months for this DVD to become available. It is a fabulous addition to my collection of Elvis music.
1,What Happened?,"Laptop's last two records End Credits and The Old Me Vs The New You were really extraordinary pieces of synth pop, the hooks were strong, the lyrics were laugh out loud funny, and yet the record had a feeling of poignancy that gave it some heft. Don't Try This at Home is missing all the elements that gave the previous releases such charm. It feels like Jesse Hartman is trying to hard with his music and lyrics this time, rather than the effortless charm of his past releases. Also, Ratso Rizzo could be one of the worst songs I've ever heard. Seriously. What gives??Do not start your Laptop collection with this record. Stick to the past two releases."
3,more songs about music and laptops,"Sounds like a deadpan David Bowie (Cat People era)fronting early Talking Heads, covering Television...not bad. But do we really need that? If your answer is ""yes"", dive in."
4,Big Kahuna,"I rate this product 4 stars. The legs are hard to extend but it is vary stable. I wish it was made in stainless for the coastal area. The burner is excellent, you can get your wok hot very quick. Karl"
4,Big Kahuna,This is an excellent stove for wok use because it really puts out the heat. I do wosh they would have made folding legs so that it could be easily transported.
3,Newowner,"Impressive power (thanks to the 10 psi regulator that comes with it) almost as much heat as the outdoor burners sold as turkey deep fryers (which I have been using to stir-fry).Not as solidly built as I expected -given the other reviews about this unit being ""extremely heavy duty"". The fire bowl portion of the unit (which the legs attach to) is just stamped sheet metal (and if you weight 250 lbs I would not advise sitting on it).My one big disappointment is that this unit is NOT PORTABLE. By that I mean that, while the legs adjust up and down, they do not fold, nor are they easily removable (without a wrench and 10 min of time to basically disassemble it.) The promo pictures that show people using this at the beach and camping etc. are somewhat deceiving. Lets just say that if you have room in your trunk full of camping gear to add a bag of golf clubs - then you will have room to take this stove along on the trip."
1,wrong item delivered,"i ordered the big kahuna, but recieved a stainless steel basket instead. now i am waiting for a reply from amazon. hope they can straigthen this out so i can write a real review."
4,A fun CD,"This is fun funky/jazzy very early 80's sounding CD by people who were all members of the band Magma at one time or another. The personnel are as follows:Didier Lockwood - ViolinsJannick Top - BassBenoit Widemann - KeyboardsChristian Vander - DrumsAs usual, I feel that any CD featuring Christian Vander is always worth a listen and this one does not disappoint. I owned it on vinyl for some years and it was nice to finally replace that copy with this superior sounding CD."
2,"More corn and cheese, please","A silly chop socky movie, with only a few notable fight scenes. Some funny dialogue, though, and truly bizarre relationships between the three main characters.""Soon, you too will call me master!""""Ah-arrrrgggghhhh!"""
1,It sux,"Come on people. Want a true fighting game, buy Dead or Alive2. This game is not even worth 1 star. The graphics are terrible. When youplay it, it seems like you are playing on a SNES. What did you buy your Dreamcast for? To see graphics from 10 years ago. Please people, be smart. Don't buy this game. Don't make the same mistake I made."
2,Poor graphics and limited game play,This game is a disappointment. With games like Soul Caliber and Dead or Alive 2 this game is not the price.
4,Great Game to add to the SF collection,"This game has only graced my living room for several days now and it has been just as fun as the previous versions of the game. Although I cannot pull of several of the moves (alpha counters) because of lack of practice, I highly enjoy playing the game. My gripe with playing SFA3 is the controllers. I think that a new version of the DC game controller needs to be released. The digital stick is raised to high from the front. These games were designed to be played with the digital, not the analog stick. My thumb get too sore and callused in short order. Over all I think it was well worth purchasing."
3,Wasn't what I was expecting,"I was not expecting the cartoonish graphics. I was hoping for a game more like Soul Calibur. This game bored quickly, even playing with a friend. The special moves were hard to pull off, leaving us to just punch each other."
5,More Than FRESH AIR,This is how you should start your Sunday Brunch off!The solos are some of the best ever!!!Mr. G knows how to get you captured in his and the band's PERFORMANCE!
2,"it was a waste of my money, the quality is so poor, seems like it was filmed by an amateur.","I will not recommend to anybody to buy this dvd. the quality is substandard, the price is quite highfor this poorly filmed dvd."
2,Let us no which ones are in color!!!!,"I ordered these CDs thinking I could get them in black & white or color. The black & white are nice but I've seen them many times in that. Now I wanted to see them in Color. So far I have watched 4 movies, only one was a choice of black & white or Color. I am very disappointed in this. Had I known this I would not have ordered them because I have most all of them in the VCRs. I'm sorry, but people should get what they thouhgt they are ordering."
4,To infinity and beyond?,"Armada is unlike any game you've ever seen before, employing the depth of strategy games like Starcraft and the decent action stages of Atari's classic Asteroids. It's not for everyone, as some of the stages take forever to conquer and worlds aren't as massive as they seem. However, stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with a unique gaming experience, complete with depth and challenge. The four-player action mode is a bonus, too, allowing you to take on friends in combat the way Asteroids should have done. I'm sure refinements will come with the upcoming Armada II, but, for now, this space certainly isn't a bad place to visit."
4,Great Tchaikovsky better Rachmaninoff Elsewhere,"This is arguably one of the finest Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto recordings of all time. Unfortunately its not matched with a comparable performance of the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto - the tempi are ponderous and Mr. Cliburn slogs through the 'alla marcia"" in the first movement as if he were wearing fly-fishing waders. He peaked in his early years and there was no further artistic growth. Having heard him bungle his live concerto performances at Tanglewood, I know why he insists his live performances not be broadcast - his reputation is based on recording engineers and retakes. His victory in Moscow was political, he made a musical career out of it."
1,Not Received,"I still have not received this product. I ordered it the week before Christmas, it was due to arrive December 30, 2010 and today is January 21, 2011. I would really like to get this sometime soon! I emailed the seller on January 11, 2011 and still have not received a response."
2,Dangerous,"All turkey frying machines are dangerous. Use this product, if so inclined, but be careful."
3,AIR SUPPLY DVD COLLECTION,"When purchasing this dvd i had not heard many Air supply hits, but the dvd is hit and miss... some songs fine and some a bit too old fashioned ...actually i come from England and thought Air supply was American.... just shows how wrong i can be, but i do have a good general knowledge on different types of music...but if you know Air supply well then i think buying this dvd would be well worth the money...ps my girlfriend sang along to a few songs, so it cannot be too bad"
5,What else can I say?,"This is a pretty good DVD with all of their greatest hits. You can put the sound to 2 channel stereo or dolby digital 5.1. It sounds much better on 5.1 even if you don't have a 5.1 setup. The videos that I found the most interesting and likeable that are not that boring were 'Even the nights are better' & 'Making Love out of nothing at all'. I also liked the big late 70s disco collar that one of the guys in the band had in the 'Lost In Love' video. There really isn't much for the 'Lost In Love' video just Air Supply singing, not very creative, ah but you just gotta love that disco collar! All in all you will like this DVD for the known bigger hits, the other half of the DVD I really didn't much care. The DVD opens up with Russel and Graham who look pretty aged making an intro to every video before it plays but you can bypass that by pressing the forward button once which takes you to the video. Not that bad."
1,"5.1 encoded audio bad, video mediocre too.","if you are just an Air Supply fan, and not particular on how theaudio is reproduced, you probably rate this DVD a 5*. The 5.1audio reproduction is really bad. (systems used:A/V Marantz 9200,Speakers: Definitive Technology BP3000TL front L/R, BP2006TL for SR/SL, BPVX/P for SBL/SBR, PF15TL for Sub, C/L/R 3000 center and DVDP Sony 6500."
2,Treasury of David,Was a little dissappointed because the (3) after the description led me to believe it was for the 3 volume set and it was really ONLY volume 3.
1,Not quite...,...(especially for the price). Nice wood but the hinges are not solid brass. The caps are but the pins are polyethylene one of which split (sheared at the center) after 2 1/2 years of ``light'' use.
4,You'll salivate.,"Even though these guys get tossed in with the ""nu-metal"" pile, there'e no doubt they're near the top of it. They have enough style to set them apart from the others, and rock just as well. The first single was ""Your Disease"", and is an excellent song. Another stand-out is ""Click Click Boom"", which was heard alot, and sounds like a good ""Bizkit"" type song. The third sweet track is ""Hollywood"", a heavy ballad. The rest is all good, and each song has at least some kind of hook. If you dig the rap-rock, you should check this cd out. It's their best one."
4,Pretty Good...,"At first I didnt like this cd, but upon giving it several good listens, this is one of the better nu-metal or rap/rock around, and I think this band can only improve. The strength of the album lies in tracks like ""Superstar,"" ""Click Click Boom"", and especially the popular ""Your Disease."" Overall, Saliva has there own distinct sound and style, and I think it works in this album"
1,Please make it stop...,"Why why why can't an original band have radio success? Saliva is more of the same from this years crop of nu metal bands. Pure filth, nothing but pure filth. Lyrically it's filth (click click BOOM!!, yeah that's the writing of a true poet). The guitars are very simple. As Saliva has found out you can mask a lack of talent pretty well by playing music that's uninspired and unoriginal. And once again mainstream America will gobble it up and ask for more until the next batch of ""heads on sticks"" comes around.If you want to listen to music that has talent and is creative listen to Faith No More, Far, Vision of Disorder, and above all Radiohead(no I take that back I wouldn't want a Saliva fan listening to Radiohead)."
3,Not exactly as pictured,"I haven't had a chance yet to use this product... I would just like to note that the picture is not right, and had spade connectors and nothing with pre-wires like shown. Even the instructions that came with it talked about being very careful not to tighten to much and so on."
1,Horrible,This movie was horrible. It made a mockery to filmmaking and entertaining in general. At all costs Avoid this movie!
1,"Wow, this is, well bad.","No I mean really bad. I have know clue what possessed me to se this terrible thing. This film is in need for the MST3K treatment. It is now becoming notorious as one one of the worst movies ever made, and it deserves that status. Usually genie movies suck, and this one was no exception. Anything with a basketball player who tries to start an acting career as a genie in a boom bow has to be bad; and it is. It's even got the most corny sentimentality you'll ever see in a movie, and it's message about second chances in life it absolutely awful. This is even insulting to kids. I mean please people if you have any humanity left in you, you would not punish your children by making them watch this horrendous thing. It's garbage, and if easily one of the worst movies ever. Goodness this stinks. Even worse than Howard the Duck, and that's saying a lot."
2,OVER SIZED,The shirts are way too big for what they advertise.The XL is at least a 2 XL.Very dissapointed.
1,No DVD!,"I have watched the movie long time ago, and i enjoyed every moment of it, i was so glad i found it in amazon but when i ordered i was shocked to find that the box was simply empty! where was the DVD?!! i am so disappointed."
1,a waste of dreamcasts power.,"i did not enjoy this game.why?it`s arcade perfect.dreamcast is able to do so much better than this game,it just hurts me to see the dreamcast being misused like this.a much better game for dreamcast is soul calibur.go buy that now if you don`t have it!overall,i did not enjoy this old school relic.sorry capcom."
2,Same old same ol.,I'm a huge fan of Marvel Characters and I've been waiting for a game whose graphics and game play are as interesting as the characters. Sadly this isn't it. The Graphics remind me of the old Streetfighter games for the Supernintendo. This game is light years behind most of the other fighter games.
4,This Game Rocks!,"An awesome fighting game that bring 2-D fighting back from the dead, lots of characters to choose from for an even 4plyr rumble, also includes helper characters to choose for your fight,I'm telling you this game Rocks!...still I think they should of include some more Marvel characters.But an awesome choice to buy if you like fighting games like street fighter or even if you dont, buy it!"
3,Not her best work,Suzanne Brockmanns' stories about navy seals are normally very good and tightly written. I found this one to be below her normal standards.
4,Michie Review,"We really like cooker and think it was a very good buy, except that the lid does not fit properly. It is apparently a little warped, it still works but does not fit flush like it is supposed to. Otherwise, the cooker is great and we are enjoying using it."
1,Refurb broke before I got to use it,"Friends bought me an unlocked refurb version of this for my birthday. It charged fine at home. But when I took it to S. America and had it activated with a local SIM, it stopped charging. I took out the SIM, put in another one (when I got home) and it still wouldn't charge properly - kept cycling on and off. The phone? the SIM? Who knows - but I need a new travel phone..."
2,Weak sonics,I was disaapointed in the sonic quality of this CD. I bought it because I had enjoyed the PBS broadcast of the concert but after listening to the CD on both my trucks CD player and an excellent home stereo system I think it is a poorly engineered recording. Maybe the broadcast was done with the DVD version.
4,Decent album,"I thought the CD was fine. I liked most songs on the album, and that's really what I'm gunning for when I buy new music. I expected a decent helping of angry music and I got it. The music's really pounding/driving at times, excellent for working out or driving fast, and songs like Breathe and Pure Energy don't disappoint (at least for me)."
4,Keep it simple: A Really good Nu Metal CD,"I never purchase a CD without hearing the bands work, but in this case I took a chance. Someone at a Fear Factory forum said there a good Techno-Metal slightly Nu Metal band. It sounded intriguing, so I figured I would check it out. Basically I can't believe I didn't discover this band any sooner, it's been in constant rotation in my car.I consider this band in the select few of Nu Metal bands that are really good. Personally I have yet to find a song on this CD that I don't like. It's heavy, and catchy at the same time.At some points the singer sounds a little like Manson(which isn't a bad thing at all).I think it could have had some more techno beats into it, but all the songs are great. Also from what I've heard from other's Crossbreed is on works of a follow up CD to 2001's Synthetic Division. Which I will probably buy...hopefully you make the purchase as this CD is cheap to.Mine came out 12.99 including shipping!"
3,"Browse through it at the store, but don't buy!","The book starts out well, but quickly becomes a bit boring. At many points simply sounds like a young man who is afraid to not print everything that has been told to him by an older man that he admires. Too many extemely short and uninteresting stories find their way into this book, which really has less to do with the evil that the title suggests, than with Hazelwood's interest in autoerotic suicides. Although it is very interesting and absolutely frightening at points, it is generally just boring."
5,A Fascinating Read,"This book is not for the faint-hearted, but neither is it unnecessarily graphic. This book flows smoothly between explaining how the BSU (Behavioral Science Unit, as it was then called) originated, and detailed discussions of true case histories that illustrate the types of crimes being described. I''ve read several books in this genre, and so am familiar with many of the cases discussed, and this book provides new and enlightening insights on many of them. For true crime fans, this book is highly recommended! For those of you who have not yet discovered the genre, this is a great way to begin. Give it a try!!"
2,Hazelwood should've picked a different writer,"While I don't discount Roy Hazelwood's expertise, I felt the book was not well-written. Stories lacked details of the criminal's acts and psychological explanations were brief. There were many opportunities to expand on a particular subject, but instead, I was left hanging and wanting to know more. Also, it was occasionally hard to get past Michaud's style of writing. Despite Hazelwood's fascinating career as a behavioral profiler, this book didn't do him justice. Perhaps a good, second book will remedy this...?"
2,Disappointing,"Couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, but should have. There is no cohesive timeline to any of the stories and I constantly had to read backwards just to try and figure out which case they were talking about. Many of the stories have no ending, they just trail off into the next case story. Critical case details were omitted and embarrassingly gruesome ""facts"" were thrown in at odd moments. I was also quite appalled by the amount of typos I came across, including the various spellings of one crime victim's last name. And, contrary to the title, I did not find much psychological insight on any of the cases. I'd rather read John Douglas's narcissistic rants - at least they make sense. Don't bother with this book."
2,"All over the map, with no destination in sight","Buying this book, I felt I would gain better insight into Roy Hazelwood and learn quite a bit about how he ""profiles"" criminals. You get some of that in this book, but there is no story being told here.The collection of chapters thrown together have no real path that they are following, so what you are getting are (to me) unrelated chapters.Will you learn more about those that commit sex crimes and what drives them to do it? Yes. Will you come away thinking you understand Roy Hazelwood any better? Probably not. Will this book be a good read? For me, the answer was a resounding NO."
5,Not just for turkeys,"This is also an excellent item for home beer brewers. On high, this burner will bring 5 gallons of water from 59 degrees F to boiling in less than 15 minutes. It will turn down low enough to keep your wort at a low boil, and the efficient burner design uses less propane than the ""jet"" style burners. The overall construction is very sturdy. I use a converted 15.5 gallon keg as a boil pot, the weight of the keg plus 10 gallons of wort is right at 115 pounds. This unit has no trouble supporting the weight, and is very stable. This is the same burner as the Big Kahuna, but the legs on the Big Kahuna don't look nearly as strong as these, plus this burner is much cheaper."
4,Charming and Sweet,"What a charming couple Julian and Lily made. Lily with her love of all God's creatures proved to be the balm that Julian's bitter heart needed. I loved all the ""cats"" in this story, especially Sebastian!The various scrappy individuals (both human and animal!) met during this story were delightfully portrayed! The tenderness that Julian showed in caring for his grown nephew Peter was wonderful. It does not often show up in Regencies, where we expect our hero to be a ruthless rogue.Julian, who thinks he is rather a rake, turns out to be a lion that lies with the lamb.A bit of fluffy reading for a delightful couple of hours."
5,She is the bomb!,"Hey people! First of all, if you don't have this single something is wrong with you. It is some of the best pop music I have ever heard. I was not sure as to buy it at first, but since I have bought it I am extremely happy that I did. It was worth every cent. Goldlocks is gonna go far!!!!!! For all of you people that haven't heard this girl sing, you will be shocked as you hear the voice of this rising pop star. Not only does she singing rock, but also her personality. She is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. So go out and buy this record! You will be totally happy that you did. LOVE YOU GOLDY!"
5,"Subtle, hilarious, and clear","Frederick Lenz has made Buddhism available to the West in ""Surfing the Hymalayas"" and ""Snowboarding to Nirvana"", through his graceful and humorous descriptions complex Buddhist concepts. He has shown that Buddhism is not some old, outdated religon based upon the esoteric writings of another culture and era, but it is alive today and ever-changing. ""Surfing the Himalayas"" does not conform to the standard image of Buddhism in many cases, but the standard image of Buddhism (like any religion) isn't necessarily the most accurate. Frederick Lenz has made the subject new and fresh and applicable to Westerners today. Be sure to check out the book on tape as well, read by the author."
2,Simplistic at best,"Lenz's book tries to outline Buddhism for a weekend reader. It's easy to read and quick too but, at times, it becomes so overly self-promoting and indulgent that it's hard to keep flipping the pages. Has a tendency to repeat himself - a lot.There are a lot better books for beginning Buddhism than this. It's mildly entertaining however."
3,"Frederick Lenz, notorious cult leader","Frederick Lenz during his lifetime was a notorious cult leader that secretly victimized hundreds of followers for money, sex, and power, effectively hiding the intents of his purpose under the guise of spiritualism and pursuits of enlightenment. Many of his victims were taught incorrect spritual principles, lived in poverty while Frederick Lenz lived in extravagant luxury, and gave most of their youth, lives, health and energy, and more specifically money to Frederick Lenz. Frederick Lenz deserves his bad reputation within the spiritual community for the harm he brought to his followers, many of them who were innocent youth and who were innocent to spiritual charlatanism and exploitation. His suicide/death is a fitting retribution of those who are false teachers and cause violence against their students. This book is only a propaganda piece for his own elevation as a teacher, whose only legacy is intense damage."
4,valid overview,"This is a valid overview of Tibetan Yoga practice, the same practice which was mastered by siddhas like Milarepa and Marpa.This does not give you the techniques but it does validate the methods of kundalini arousal which are standard fare for advanced yogins of all religious and philosophical persuasions.For the price, this is a steal.==============================For information on the techniques see some of my books here:[...]Meditation PictorialBrahma Yoga Bhagavad GitaKriya Yoga Bhagavad Gita"
5,laid- back masterpiece.,"i love this cd. pure and simple. let me say it again, i am in love with this cd. 3 vocal tracks (an appearance by beth orton) and 10 instrumentals that are melodic and lovely and perfect for late night listening. quiet music at its best. thank you, mr barnes."
1,Can't believe I wasted my money,"Best advice:""don't buy!"" Product is lousy! Doesn't work as it is supposed too.Liquid Push Down Alcohol Dispenser Labeled"
5,The Big Book of Preserving the Harvest,This book is fabulous!! It is great for projects also for young children.
3,Poor title for book,"The book title is Preserving the Harvest. To me this meant canning. Instead, the author includes to many recipes using the harvest, but not canning. I made the Mint Jelly recipe which was a total failure, being too runny. The author should update her recipe instructions. Do I dare try other recipes and waste good produce? I will try a few of the vinegar recipes, which can't go too wrong. Suggest buyers, especially beginners, use the old tried and true Ball canning recipes."
1,Snitch Rap,"E Money Bags is a snitch. He snitched on everyyone from Ja Rule, Jody Mack, O-1, Black Jus, Supreme & many other members of the Supreme teamIT makes me sick that all of you people praise him. He's nothing more then a snitchHe's the inventor of the worst rap group ever G-UnitWhen The king of New York (Preme) AKA the Real Neno Brown's right hand man Colbert ""Black Jus"" Johnson was murdered unprofessionally they had enoguh & someone had to die.SO E Money Baggs was murdered like a ProFrankly I'm glad he died"
4,Relaxing CD,"If you enjoy James Galway, you should get this CD. It is wonderful easy listening music for when you are doing something else like reading. It is not as exciting as some of his other CDs but just as good. All the songs are beautiful and will be greatly appreciated."
2,Could of been worst.,"For an independent low budeget zombie movie, it was still better than Day of the Dead 2."
4,Just Looking,"We absolutely love this movie! Only problem was the disk arrived with several scratches on it, but it seemed to play all right."
4,predictable but fun and enjoyable,"Jason Alexander directed this coming of age story that takes place in late 1950's NYC. Sweet, predictable, totally enjoyable ... totally worth it. Has a plot twist or two and teaches us that we're not perfect and forgiveness and acceptance are the better angels of out nature."
5,Great tool,"My wife got this for Christmas last year. She loves it and uses it almost every day. Very sturdy. In this part of texas we have a lot of rocks and it stands up to the toughest chore. Great product, worth the money"
2,Still Numb,"I am a 50-year-old male who keeps trying to find an anatomically correct bicycle seat that doesn't create numb parts after riding for an hour or so. This seat claimed to have those qualities and looked the part. While the seat was very comfortable, it unfortunately didn't prevent the numbness."
5,Very comfortable,A very comfortable seat that is about as good as a bike seat can get. I usually ride about 22 miles a day without the pain I used to get.
4,An amazing difference.,"Feels great on the tush. Money well spent, it is now more encouraging to go for a ride knowing that something that should be fun will not hurt anymore!"
1,Uncomfortable,"I returned it because the seat is uncomfortable dont get mislead by the ""Comfort"" in the title. Spend a little more and get a better seat it does make the most contact with you when you are on your bike besides the handle bar grips."
2,nice looking however shipping and burner problems,"package arrived intact however the packaging isn't durable for shipping this type of item. Lid was dented as well as bottom of pot, most likely due to shipping. stand and assembly of pot went well. The biggest problem I had was the burner would not light after several attempts. i read and re-read the instructions but could not get gas to light. this unit arrived with a timer off the regulator so i removed it to see if this was the lighting issue. It lit on first try - however the regulator valve does not work so must use the propane LP valve to turn on and off instead. 4th of july weekend and the office is closed to today - july 3rd - so no one can help not even the website. I hope to use this item tonight to cook clams but have my doubts. wish me luck as I will call Eastman 1st thing Monday to get repair or refund of unit or regulator hose."
3,Better than its manufacturer!,"We purchased this to try to address moisquitos getting into our cabin and bothering us at night. It picked up quite a few, although they still bothered us as well. But out of the box, the black light didn't work. As the text stated it was a new type, I didn't know how bright it should be. Called the 800 number and left a message. After a couple of days, opened it up and found the bulb wasn't plugged in, so plugged it in and then the light worked as well as the fan. The light and the fan takes some getting used to if you're trying to sleep in the same room with them, which we were. But three months later, I'm still waiting for Flowtron to call me back and address the question I had left with them. So the unit is OK, but the company isn't much on customer service (at least to this customer!)."
2,Not very effective,"I own both the Flowtron BK80D and this ""Galaxie"" model. The reason I bought this unit was to avoid creating more noise (BK80D makes zapping noise). It does succeed in trapping small flying insects, just not enough. I see the ""swarm"" of insects around it, so the blacklight and octenol must be effective at drawing them in. I suspect the failure is the fan isn't strong enough to suck them in (evidence is little moths able to fly in/out and around it without getting trapped). I am ecstatic with the Flowtron BK80D - its a lean mean killing machine in comparison (piles and piles of insects fall to the ground). This unit barely got a handful after 2 months of continuous operation (and diligent octenol replacement). Sorry Flowtron, but this one is a miss!Pros:Quiet operationEasy to cleanCons:Not very effective at sucking insects in"
2,Horrible Animation Quality,"By this point in the series, it was obvious that it was obly being created to make $$$. They kept introducing new and never before seen characters so that they could make more toys and make more money. The animation quality fell off drastically to the point where some frames literally go through other frames and the picture is just this big image of nothing. At other times, transformers will literally walk through their surrounding scenery without seeming to come in contact with any of it. Really, they walk through spaceships, giant pets, and trees without ever disturbing it, or having it disturb them. The animation was horrible!The stories don't get much better either, honestly. Some of these plots are so fantastically lame (a disco club gone bad?) that the episodes are extremely difficult to sit through even for a mad-wicked Transformer fan like myself. If you want to see great Transformers watch Season 1 or the movie. This simply doesn't cut it."
4,gift,My two grand daughters love to do these fill in books so I get them every christmas. for stocking fillers
1,the wrong one TWICE,I ordered this twice from two different places on Amazon and BOTH of them were the wrong one. I wanted this for my ninty year old mother in law for her birthday but all that I got was Glenn Miller songs that were NOT the one pictured. I spent lots of money for nothing.
2,nothing special,"This is a short pamphlet-type booklet (48 pages) that lists more shrub-type flowers than annuals and perennials that do well in Florida. Strictly for collectors of old garden books, it was written in 1959 and does not list the zones that each flower shrub/tree does best in. Also, on the cover, it says ""With Color Illustrations"" but there are only 4 pages at the center of the booklet. Otherwise it shows a black and white illustration above each plant that is described. A warning: no varieties are listed and no information that you can't find elsewhere."
2,Looking for Viper one,"I was sad to find out this CD wasn't the ""Viper commercial"" version of the great Magic Carpet Ride song. The CD is still okay, but it just wasn't what I was led to believe. Fans should still get it, it will probably please them...."
1,Their worst,After falling in love with Dot-com I went back to give this one a few listens. My worst fears confirmed- not one song here is as good as the worst song from Dot-Com.I keep it just to have their full collection.Nice cover though.....
5,Brilliant,"What a brilliant singer is Mario Lanza. Listening to this CD, one can get lost in the beautiful music. Reproduced with crystal clear sound, this CD would give any listener enjoyment for many years to come. I love it."
3,Warm & Comfy,Bought 8 pairs of Skechers just before Christmas when Amazon had a shoe sale and $20 off over $80 purchase. Essesntially paid $11 each. I like them all. Gave a couple away as gifts. Very comfortable and stylish. Not a bulky look shoe; sleak and slender on the feet.
3,Not my cup of tea,"The acting was good, but the subject matter is extremely depressing. I bought the movie because of Rufus Sewell. Sorry I did."
2,Not about photographing the paranormal,"This book was an expensive disappointment. It gives no information or instgruction on how to photograph the paranormal. Not only that, I cannot tell you how many photos they mention in their text, you look for the photo and it is not even included in the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. This woman also claims nothing (spirits, good or bad) can ever follow you home which is not true. She claims you cannot photograph an orb without flash which is also false. Don't waste your money; get it out of the library or better yet, don't even read it!"
5,Surprising and interesting...,"I find that the more I read of Diane Chamberlain's books the more I like the author. This is a very interesting and surprising book, especially the ending. I think that the author keeps you guessing and I find it facinating to finally reach the end of the book with anticipation."
1,Cheap retainer case,I recieved my retainer in the mail and it was broke in several pieces. I dont know if these are made cheap or what but the i was waiting for this to come in and it was broke. So irriated.
1,Breathing holes don't allow night guard storage in water,"Our order was processed and shipped promptly, but when we received the night guard cases, we discovered that they had breathing holes which pretty much make the case useless if you need to keep your night guard or retainer stored in water. Holes are small and not visible in the illustration."
4,ME 262,"It is a nice replica it is what I expectedIt has some stains of glue and the pitot in the left wing has ben repaird and it bends a little.I recomend it, it in my desk,"
2,Disappointing,"You may want to buy this if you are interested in the development of modern folkloric music, and it may be enjoyable to listen to if you don't know the languages being sung. However, if you know Spanish, Portuguese, or Italian, I wouldn't recommend it. I find it disconcerting that the lyrics are not set to the music according to the natural rhythm of the words. It seemed an interesting but ultimately failed experiment at cross-cultural pollination; a mish-mash rather than a harmony. For me, this album certainly didn't live up to the rave reviews of previous reviewers."
5,Happy feet for everyday ... and Marathon Worthy !!,"I bought these shoes the day after a 22 mile run where I got blisters on my toes. I was planning to run a marathon in 3 weeks and clearly needed an upgrade. From the moment I slipped into the Gel Kayano's (w/ superfeet which I also strongly recommend for arch support!), I had happy feet!! These shoes take no breaking in, they fit your feel wonderfully and provide great support for long or short runs. I actually have high arches and they work really well for me! I am since on my 4th pair of Asics, 2nd pair of Gel Kayano's."
1,Did not work past the first day,"I made the mistake of disregarding the reviews and ordered the calculator. The second day I had it, it would not turn on. I will just return it. Next time, I will pay more attention to negative reviews."
2,Not as good as prior HP products,"I bought this in 2008 to replace another HP (48G) used extensively for work. I disregarded the previous reviews that this was an inferior product compared to prior HP calculators and have found that this was not a good idea. My main complaint is with keystrokes not registering. Now granted I believe you can turn on the beeper to sound when keystrokes are registered, but I don't want my coworkers listening to beeping all day, so that's not always an option. I have an old 12c and still have an old 48G and this product is now third in line behind those other two.The 12c might be older and have less functionality, but its still a better option when it comes to usability."
1,JUNK,"This new model, supposedly ""improved"" is JUNK. I have the 17B II and just compared it with my wife's 17B II ""+"" just bought here for her real estate course.Save yourself grief and and try to find the old model instead. Even if it costs more money (there is a reason...).The quality of the HP 17BII calculator is GONE. Shame on HP."
1,HP is going the Kmart way,"Obviously, the folks at HP think they have discovered a new business model. Use only the cheapest components and subcontract the assembling to sweatshops in the far-east. No need for pre-production testing and debugging. The buying public will do the testing and all design flaws will be fixed later. Eventually.Stay away from this turkey, the keyboard is defective and you'll be lucky to get a month of use out of it. Or buy it as a gift for someone you hate."
3,Not bad... but stick to the 12C if you like RPN,"the 17BII+ is not a bad calculator, comes in a nice case. But the buttons don't have the same tactile feel of the 12C. Forget all those naysayers (old farts) who way the current 12C is not up to par with the historical 12C, we did a comparison here at work between different models... pretty darn similar. I think the current 12c is 0.1 grams lighter than the old. Well within measurement error of our scale and maybe just due to different battery system.17BII+ is a bit faster than the 12c. But the form factor doesn't lend itself as easily to RPN (the enter button is small and not as central). But good easy to use functions.All in all, a decent calculator. But not sure if it will acquire ""classic"" status."
5,Best calculator for finance professionals,"While I agree that the upgraded model is not that impressive, the overall calculator is by far the best for finance professionals. Whether you're an investment banker, corporate finance, or real estate professional this is the industry standard."
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap","Ditto all the other reviewers' comments about the cheap construction of this POS. I've been an HP calculator user for 25 years, and am astounded at the cheap junk that they are now willing to put their name on. Forget about technical capabilities; if the damn keyboard doesn't function properly its all just academic. The keyboard on the 17bii+ is garbage. Routinely misses keystrokes. A calculator that costs $100 should be a quality item. Costs 4-5x as much as comparable TI or Casio financial calculator models. If it wasn't for the fact that HP is still the only manufacturer using true RPN I would have switched long ago. At this point, I think I'll just suck it up and forget about RPN because I'm tired of paying through the nose for a new HP when the old one breaks down every two years. Shame on you HP."
4,Good with Math,"Calculator is much better than I expected after reading other reviews about it. It might not weigh as much as the older HP's but button action is the best of the all the calculators I own and I like the logic of the button layout, much better than my BAII Plus. Wish I had bought this calculator first."
3,Is any crew better than no crue?,"Having only purchased this album 24 hours ago and only hearing it once, I have to say that it's not bad but it's not great.Vince Neil is only one fourth of what makes Motley Crue the greatest rock and roll band in the world and this album makes that perfectly clear.11 of the albums 12 tracks are Motley Crue songs with only 1 track being lifted from Vince's first solo album.While it is true that Vince has been a huge part of Motley's success, as a solo act this has not been the case,his own solo efforts have failed.Thus he is really cashing in on Motley Crues reputation with a cover band.He has been quoted as saying that live recordings of his own songs have been 'lost'.I doubt this is the case.Still the players on this record or good and of course the songs are great, it just would have been nice to hear Vince stand on his own merrits.Hardcore fans will enjoy this as long as they take it for what it is a Motley Crue covers albim.Buy Entertainment Or Death first."
5,Best tecno mix ever,We actually bought this one as a replacement to one thart was stolen years agi. We tried dowliading the same songs but could never get the exact right ones or couldn't find them period. We even trued a few different cds but none are as good as this one. It has a nice collection of songs that flow inti one another. Its a collection you can also stand to listen to completely sober
2,BAH!,"Cheese. Only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it's nice to listen to poppy tunes. *sometimes* I suppose it would be nice for someone just getting started in trance *as it was for me* but now I wouldn't buy this if you paid me. Get Tranceport by Paul Oakenfold. A much better cd for classic old trance. After you get situated, start getting recent stuff by Sasha, Markus Schulz, Armin van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, etc. Also check out the Nukleuz and Tidy labels for harder trance. www.trance.nu"
3,A decent compilation of Euro-Dance style techno,"Despite being named ""Trance Party"", this CD contains little in the way of true ""trance"" music. Trance style techno is usually fast, multi-layered, and contains few if any vocals. What you will find here is many Euro-Dance techno club hits, and there are a few good ones. ""Castles In The Sky"", ""Can't Keep Me Silent"", ""Ordinary World"", and ""Better Off Alone"" are all representative of the Euro-Dance genre and are very listenable tracks. There are several bland tracks that lean more toward R&B than Euro-Dance though, and there are a couple songs that are ruined by annoying samples like ""Omnibus"". ""Trance Party"" is not a bad choice when you consider that there's a little bit of every style of dance music on it...so there should be at least one or two tracks that appeal to everyone. If you like what you hear on ""Trance Party"", you should also check out the DMA Dance series."
2,plate will not remain level,"The fence is of good quality. The mounting plate is of good quality. The cabinet is convenient. However, the plate is adjustable. It will not remain level with the table top. Adjusting it repeatedly, while frustrating, is not even an option. The fibers of the MDF top have already loosened to point where I cannot tighten the screws intended to level the plate. I must now refashion a table top because my return window has expired. Do not buy this product."
2,Almost unusable,I paid $80 for this off craigslist and even though it was less than half the price I wouldn't buy it again. My table is mint condition with all the accessories. The problem is the table isn't flat and boards catch on the router plate when passing over it. Other reviewers have noted this as well. I am going to attempt to shim it but with all the lips for wood to catch on I don't think I will ever be able to route end grain on this table. You would think the most important part of a router table is for wood to slide smoothly over it.
3,Average at Best,I take pride in purchasing tools that are built well but without spending inordinate amounts of money (aka Norm!)I agree with many of the previous reviews concerning leveling of plate and the edges being higher on the exiting of the wood. I have adjusted my techniques a bit and find the table good for the average joe!The other side of the coin was that I couldn't find a table any better than this. Many that I looked at were metal framed and past history has me balking at that design. Others had the same lipping issue on exit.Average but I use it regularly!
1,Is there anything real about this book?,"I read the first addition of this book and was blown away by the bad advice, sexual innuendos, and not-so-cute in-jokes. At times there is some legitimate advice being offered, however for the most part you would be better served tossing this one back onto the pile.I doubt anyone would be prepared for a real life college experience after reading this book. In fact at one point the book recommends using duct table to attach things to the walls of a dorm room. Guess what -- that is a bad idea! Duct tape peels paint when removed. Peeled paint means room dammages, which means you, the poor college freshman, will be charged additional fees. BAD BAD BAD BAD"
2,will keep anyway,I was looking for a connector that would connect to my Nikon camera and then to a Portable DVD player so when I take pictures the picture would show up on the Portable DVD Player. This did not work. Not sure what type of connector that I need. I saw someone doing this and thought this was the right piece. hmmm! Don't know where to turn to for help.
1,"Don't buy, it is not format as a dictionary","Due poor formating kindle can not recognize it as a dictionary, so it is a waste of time and money."
2,Poor Fit,I was disappointed with the loose fit which the picture doesn't show. I found the case clumsy to operate and of no value if you expect it to protect the camera from sand or anything but actually dropping the camera.
2,Where Were The Editors??,"I used this book in a 400-level computer science course (and I did get an A) and found it incredibly frustrating.Most of the meat of the book is well presented and fairly well written.But! There were so many errors and ommisions in chapter-ending questions, diagram figures, and charts/figures that anything otherwise positive about the book was cancelled out.My edition was new as of Spring '98, it and the previous two versions used by students in my class were loaded with errors.The bottom line, what book addresses the subject better? I have to think this is a good buy, just wait for a newer edition and hope that the complex performance/cost analysis questions aren't already doomed by errors."
3,NBA JAM on Steroids,"If you're going to buy this game, ask yourself a question, Did I like NBA JAM on SNES? If the answer is YES then buy this game. If the answer is NO and you want a more realistic basketball game go for NBA 2K or NBA 2K1. The gameplay is much the same is NBA JAM, 2 buttons each for turbo, shoot/jump & pass/steal. This is a fun game, don't get me wrong, but I also enjoyed NBA JAM back in the day. Creating a player is very worth it, as you tend to feel a connection with your player. As you progress your character gets stronger, faster and so on as you distribute attribute points both from answering trivia questions and from winning games. So, ask yourself that one little question, and base your decision off that."
5,More fun than NBA 2K,"This game is a lot more fun than NBA 2K. I've played both, and in comparing them, this is simply more fun. In NBA 2K, everyhting is completely difficult and a little TOO realistic. If you're like I am and like high scoring games and over-the-top fun (with simple controls!), then this game is for you. Plus, in what other game can you create a horse and make him dunk?"
3,NBA HANGTIME RING A BELL,"I could've swore i played the game for my n64. The game was called NBA HANGTIME.IT was ok but this game has a little more. MORE heads in create a player mode, BETTER sound (especially the announcer) AND MIGHT I ADD WAY BETTER DUNKS. Though the game was the game was fun it feels like dajavou."
4,Fun for the kids,The kids were excited to receive the toy. They are really into Pokemon so it is fun for them to learn about the characters and play the games. I like the volume option.
1,horrible,DO NOT BUY this is terrable the clip broke within the hour the barrel fell out and the battery over heats dont buy for your own good and there is no refund don waste your money
5,"Very Informative, Buy it today!","""Hidden Coast of California"" is a well written book-- very easy to read and divided into neat sections. The book goes from northern California to southern, from beginning to end, so it is especially helpful for those who are going on a ""real"" California roadtrip.This book has been especially helpful with the planning of my future trip to California. Even though I haven't been able to test out the accuracy of the book, I feel as though I've lived there for years because of all the detailed information the book offers. Planning a trip down the coast of California isn't easy especially when you have a time limit, but this book has helped me sleep at night knowing that I have the knowledge to get the most out of my trip (and money).I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is planning a trip to California and those who want to see some little known hideaways."
4,excellent characterization,"This is a very enjoyable read with strong characters and an interesting plot. I am eager to read Agee's other novels now. I did find the sudden two-page ending disappointing. It seemed as if the author's editor had telephoned the author and told her she had five minutes to wrap up the book. Bam, the airplane lands, Ty runs into the barn, Harney is dead. THE END. I would have much preferred a confrontation between Ty and Harney before Harney died."
4,Bag looks Good and lots of room,"The bag just arrived, it has a lot of space compared to the tight fitting one I have. It looks good, just have to learn to pack it correctly. It is good for carring your equipment just remember to open it face up or everything will fall out. To be able to carry a laptop it has to to be pretty small, mine would not fit as I hoped it would."
4,Almost perfect,"The padding provides a lot of security and cushion for the cameras and lenses; I've dropped the backpack a few times and the equipment have remained safe and are still in perfect working condition.I wish the backpack is bigger, has a broad and padded waist/hip strap so it doesn't move while hiking or running, and the flap over the zipper for the main compartment folded over the other direction so rain water will have less chance of seeping into the pack.I like it a lot for how it is but with those few adjustments, it'll be perfect for me."
3,Good for the money.,"I own this bag and have used it for several months. This bad does exactly as advertised. I have to be careful to make sure the zippers are fully secured or the bag may open unintentionally.After several months, I don't feel this bag is for me. This bag is dedicated only to a camera and lenses. I do a lot of outdoor photography which leaves me needing space for other things (food, water, sunblock, insect repellant...) I will soon purchase a more expensive bag which offers camera and lens storage as well as a large compartment. I believe this bag would be great for certain uses but maybe not so great for me."
2,"Poor Zippers, only OK","I like the basic function of the bag, but I am stunned at the poor quality of the zippers. All of the zippers on the bag have malfunctioned from the first day. I live overseas and it arrived more than 30 days after it was shipped so returning it without penalty is near to impossible, even for a bag that doesn't work. Generally the inside is OK, but not if you want longer lenses. I like the depth of it, so med size lenses can stand. The stretch cord is way too long and so it catches on stuff like tree branches. I wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't buy it again."
5,Everything fits! Fabulous camera bag!!,"I love this camera bag, it holds everything!!! It's nice to grab it and go. It is on the larger side for me so I'll be purchasing a small/compact version when I don't need everything."
4,"Big enough for me, may be small if you have a lot of gear...","It is very well padded and works for my needs. My only complaint is the infamous Canon name in bright letters... I know, I know... The manufacturer wants to promote their brand. The problem is that you become a target especially when walking around third world countries... If I had it my way, the name of manufacturer would be a replaceable velcro tag. Anything to keep a low profile. I'll probably sew something over the canon name..."
5,Nice Product - very happy with it!,"I was a bit unsure about this backpack - it's pretty cheap - but it proved to be a perfect size (not too big) and seems very sturdy. Nice little touches and lots of storage, comfortable to wear. Nice work Canon (not know for camera bags...)."
5,Love The Bag....,"This is a great bag. It holds the camera a few lens, light meter and even a small laptop. I recommend this bag for any looking for a good deal and a good bag."
5,Perfict,I love my camera backpack. It holds everything nicely. The only problem I have had is the zipper Grips have come off and I have had to replace some of them. Now all I need is more lenses to fill the slots!
5,Great Item,Great pack! lots of compartments and straps. The velcro compartments are great for storage. I'm very picky and this item fit the bill.
5,Fabulous service and product,The Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG turned up in New Zealand in an incredible 5 days from placing my order. The delivery date and the product quality exceeded my expectations.The pack is of excellent quality with resizable slots that allows me to fit all my camera gear in easily and it sits so well on my back during a tramp. Thank you so much. tommonz
5,canon backpack,"Very nice and sturdy bag has room for my t1i and three lenses plus 2 flashes , memory cards and other items with room to spare.construction is sturdy .price on amazon exelent."
1,Just what the Doctor ordered!,I just want to say thanks! Everything was how you described it. So far it has worked well! It has even traveled to Europe and it still looks new!Philman
5,Canon Camera Backpack,This is a GREAT price and value! I fit both my digital SLR and film SLR cameras AND the lenses and still have room for more. Nice sturdy padded dividers. Excellent quality!
2,Only for light use,"I have had this bag for a year or so and am not extremely happy with it. It is truly only for light use. The smaller cameras (350D, 400Xti) would work with maybe two telephotos and a flash. Also I really don't use it that much and one of the straps for securing the bag around my waste has almost come out. I am going to have it repaired and will probably try to sell the bag. Canon really shouldn't put their name on it. Time to move on to a lowe pro."
3,One big problem,"Overall, I think this is a good bag with tons of storage and compartments...I did realize one big problem after taking it for a day. Because it is a backpack, it's not so convenient. In order to take out your camera safely, you have to sit down, lay the bag flat and then open the zippers. It is not as convenient as a shoulder / sling bag where you can take out the camera easy and quickly. The zippers on my bag are very loose, so if I attempt to open the bag while upright, everything will fall out.I use it mainly as a storage bag now. For a bag I carry with me, I bought a Lowepro slingbag (200AW) and it works great.For analogy, I think of this bag as a minivan... whereas my Lowepro slingbag as a sportscar."
3,Great bag but...,"Is a great bag for cameras and lens'. However, it could have been made better by adding a space for a laptop. As someone who shoots weddings often, I sometimes carry my laptop as well-- especially if I am out of town for a shoot. Just something to consider. However, I like the size and the fact that it's not super bulky unlike other camera bags I have owned."
3,The product is okay,Overall it is good. The main thing that I am concerned is that the zipper is not locked so it may open itself if you take both of the handlers of the zipper on the top of the bag. My advice is to use only one zipper handle and take it all the way down to the bottom of the bag.
1,knock-off?,"Having bought an identical backpack from a Best Buy store for $79, the one puchased here seems to be a knock off of a real cannon back pack when you investigate the details of construction-interior lining material, zippers and zipper pulls, stitching, labeling etc. One would never know this if they didn't have both of them to compare....so yes, the one online is cheaper, but at what expense and is it real or knock off???"
2,No good for tall guys,"This pack has nice pockets, but I am 6' and the pack tends to fall right at my midback which I find uncomfortable, also the shoulder straps are not very well designed as they meet in the center of the pack which for broader shoulder can put the load on the neck muscles more than I would like. I am going to get one of the Lowe bags as they have been designing for years."
3,its cool,"the bag is ok it does the job, the first day i got it one zipper puller came off that sucks, but i did not notice anything else break since then.i saved i a lot of money cause the same bag in best buy is much more expensive so its worth the money."
5,Canon camera backpack,"This is a sturdy, well made camera equipment carryall. It's well thought out and especially well designed. Compared to other camera bags, this is very reasonably priced. One of the best back-pack bags I've seen."
4,Complete bag & portability!,"This Canon bag is great! I have been using it for the last 3 years with no problems. I have recently upgraded to a bigger camera bag to consolidate my gear and my laptop with the tighter travel requirements. It fits my 50D with battery pack and 24-70mm with hood fully attached, 100mm macro IS, 50mm 1.4, 70-200mm f4 IS, charger, readers, etc, and 580ex flash on the outside netting in packaging, and there is more space... For a little bag, it is very spacious!There is one negative about the bag is stability, with the bag full and more so when ""not"" full, it tends to tip forward unless it is leaning on something stationary.I would still recommend this to anyone looking for a good bag, whether you are a beginner or semi-pro."
4,Exactly as I thought.,"This is exactly the backpack a begginer needs. Good build quality, good material. Not too big but enough room for 3 lenses including a 55-250mm zoom lens and my Canon T3i with the grip mounted. It's comfortable to carry and looks really nice. It's waterproof by the way, already proved!!!!! hehehe Zippers have good quality, better than I expected. The only complain are the rings in the front that came a little rusty, but for the price it is a minor detail."
4,"great photo backpack, especially for the price","This pack was purchased as an up-size after buying more (and larger) glass. Main section has decent configure-ability. Plenty of pockets. Good enough padding, both for the equipment and my shoulders / back. Construction seems very good. Straps can be adjusted to suit the user. Very good, especially for the price."
2,Not a fan,"Any type of Camera Bag is very subjective.. some will love it, others will not. In this case, I am in the do not like it category.I spend most of my time photographing in the Florida Everglades/Field environment.First, the positive about this bag... Well constructed, definitely keeps equipment safe when the bag is securely closed.What I did not like was the giant zipper opening that just falls open, that does not feel secure.. To remove equipment you must lay the backpack down and remove the top ""flap"". Otherwise, you run the risk of have a complete yard sale of everything in the bag.The other negative for me was all the straps/cords/etc hanging off the bag, just not to my liking."
3,"Didnt know a crooked ""Canon"" tag could bother me so much.","This backpack has a metal like Canon name plate on the outside of the bag, on this backpack the name plate is crooked. I did not think it was going to bother me but it is very annoying."
4,"Great backpack, a bit small for a big person","I love the backpack for carrying around my XSi with all my goodies. Plenty of room for the body and 3 lenses, battery grip and flash diffuser. Lots of little compartments for other crap I don't have yet but will soon decide I need as this photography hobby has turned into a habit!It's a bit tiny for a big person, looks a little silly on my back but it's handy enough and much better than the other bag that came with the camera."
5,"great name, great bag","i have always been happy with canon product from their point and shoot cameras, to their digital SLR's.... the camera bag works great, you can travel light or you can cram quite a bit of equipment into this bag. the price was great too, a lot of competators bags on the market are too expensive and do the same thing. great buy!"
4,Great for the photo essentials.,I bought this backpack for my Canon 40D a while back. It has protected my equipment twice from being caught in downpours and I used it throughout the winter and summer. I carried at one time a Canon 1ds-mk II with a 70-200 f/2.8L and 24-70 f/2.8L plus my 580EX mk II flash and flash bracket along with a digital master light meter and other odds and ends. It's great that you can mover around the partitions. Great bag!
5,Canon Camera Carry w/ security and ease,"My husband bought me the Canon EOS digital XTI for my birthday last year with two lenses. I needed a secure way to carry those lenses as well as my wallet/keys and camera on vacation. I had been searching local camera stores as well as the internet and I found this backpack available on Amazon. I just used it on our trip to Washington DC. It was great! The padding can be rearranged to fit whichever lens or camera that needed to be carried at that time. The backpack was easily accessible and I could put my camera in when I needed to and change lenses fairly quickly. I put the weight in the bottom section of the backpack but, again, the compartments can be changed instantly for personal preference."
2,Great for storage but not as a backpack,"This bag is great for holding a camera, 5 lenses and a flash. If you are going to use it to hold your equipment and walk for a mile or two save your money. The shoulder straps are not comfortable at all at the backpack is bottom heavy so it does not want to sit on your back correctly for walking."
3,"Sorry, I don't agree...","The best feature of this product is the velcro on the inside that allow you to re-size the storage compartments to your own personal needs. I actually ordered this product for a Nikon camera and everything fit fine.My biggest problem with this product is that there is no convenient way to carry a tripod. I tried using the side straps, but since there is only one strap on each side there is room for it to move around which is annoying when you're trying to hike. I tried several other ways to secure the tripd but nothing seemed to work. I usually just have someone else carry it or strap it on separately."
5,I LOVE this bag!!!,"This bag is sturdy, practical, excellent quality, easy and comfortable to use. The price is outstanding! I'm extremely happy with it."
4,Excellen Bag for Amatures,"This bag is excellent. Ample size, but Leaves something to be desired in the Depth."
4,best buy,"Great value for the price. It holds my Eos 10D with vertical grip, 70-200, 17-40, 580 flash , and 300F4 lens perfectly. Is it perfect, no the zippers could be better, but it holds my basic system perfect. A friend saw mine and bought one the next day, despite already owning a much larger Tamarac bag. It holds enough to comfortably carry all day long."
5,Great camera bag! It is exactly what I was looking for....,"I originally saw this bag at a big box retailer and they are charging over double Amazon's price! Plenty of room for my 5D MkII, flash, 24-70L lens and a few others, but still a very compact bag. Also the front compartment is big enough to hold a tablet and other accessories, which was a key selling point for me. Great bag at an even better price!Also, the photo on Amazon is a little off. The accents on the bag are more of an olive green, not the light tan that the picture shows."
4,Great,This Backpack provides ample space for my new camera and the lenses that I have and will get in the near future. Great quality!
4,Solid Mid Size Camera Bag,"I am very pleased with this purchase. The Bag is a little larger than I expected, but for the price I got more for far less than most competitors' products. Enough space for multiple lenses, cameras and accessories, and its fairly weather resistent, treated lip covers zippers at all openings. I used it on a week long camping trip for its maiden voyage and everything was easily accesible and well protected from the elements."
5,Nice camera backpack by Canon,"I actually purchased this backpack before my canon EOS camera, lenses, and flashes arrived. The pack is well designed and holds enough equipment to have on hand for an outing without becoming too heavy, or bulky to carry around. I have a three day trip coming up tomorrow and will have a better idea on it's function when I return."
5,It has all my gear...,"I got this about 14mos ago from Amazon.... now I thought I would outgrow it coz I've added a lot more gear.... nah, with a little thought and rearrangement... I can't believe it carries all my stuff...400D + BG-E3 + Camera Armor Tough Strap + Hand Strap40D + BG-E2N (stock strap)EF 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 ISEF 50 f/1.8 IIEF 28-135 f/3.5-5.6 IS USM + 78BII hoodEF 70-200 f/4 L IS USM + hoodSigma 24-70 f/2.8 EX DG Macro + hoodKenko 2x TC MC4Digital Optics 0.45x WC580exCleaning kit (Lenspen 4x kit, Eclipse + PecPad)Four battery chargers (2x NB-2LH, 1x BP-511A, 1x AA charger)Rubber BlowerEF-D focusing screen carry caseLots of cables (2x for charger, 2x for car charger, 2 USBs, 2 AV)AA batteries (3 whole sets for flash), carry cases for BG-E3 and BG-E2NCFs(3x 2Gb, 1x 1Gb, 3x 128Mb, 1x 8Mb), CF carrying casesCokin UV Filters and CPL (72mm, 58mm & 52), Kenko 67mm UVExtra NB2LH's, and BP-511A's and covers.USB card readers (2x)Black trash bag (just in case for weather)"
1,doesnt work well at all,"My boyfriend purchased this and thought it was going to work great. the seller we purchased from was awesome, so do not think this review is a reflection of them. the Wrench itself worked good one time and the next time he tried to use it, it wouldnt work at all. He got about 5 mins of it, if that. Not happy and will be returning it for a refund."
2,poor brahms,"the greatest genius of 19th century tonal music deserves better than to be played by this, excuse me, hack. stoltzman is one of those artists better praised for his marketing and his popularization of the repertoire for the masses than for his playing. his brahms is just too uncouth, too impure. the vibrato i find inappropriate, and the playing sloppy. passion is no excuse for uneven rhythm and messy phrases."
3,Voices,"This music takes you to really new places with sound. Somehow it felt full of the insect kingdom. Interesting themes for meditation, frictional dissolves, and an emotional journey with self."
3,"Enjoyable, but Predictable","I have read all the books in this mystery series. I did find Mistletoe Man an enjoyable read; however, the events occurring in the book were very predictable. I guessed what Ruby's problem was before she announced it to China in the storyline. I also had the murderer picked out in advance. I do not believe this book will turn me away from the series because the series has been enjoyable as a whole. However, the author needs to direct her storyline towards a more intelligent audience...because we are more intelligent than she gives us credit for being."
1,disappointed,"I found this book very disappointing. I have a large collection of sewing & serging books that are inspiring and useful, and this book isn't either of those. There are few applications in this book I would ever use, and it most likely will just sit on the shelf."
2,Too expensive,"The mistake was mine in that I was looking for an unabridged Italian/English dictionary. When the Garzanti arrived I thought it a nicely bound and designed book, however I was disappointed to learn that for this much money it was not unabridged. For $95, I expect a lot. I expect more than 75,000 words defined. My Harper Collins Sansoni unabridged was only $55."
4,Not Their Best,"I was really excited for the realease of this Templars CD but was somewhat dissapointed when I heard it. It is good, but ""good"" by Templars standards isn't all that great. And not all that great by Templars standards is still far superior to other Oi! coming out these days.Compared to their last full length album ""Omne Datum Optimum"" the Templars have slowed down a little bit. This new one isn't nearly as heavy as their last release, and the style is a little more Rock N Roll, and it has less of that early RAC/Oi! style. Carl's vocals are a little rougher than in past releases, but they still sound good with the music. All in all, I'd say any fan of the Templars should go ahead and add this to their collection. But if you're just getting started with this group, check out some of their past releases, namely the aforementioned ""Omne Datum Optimum"" or even their EP ""1118-1312"" which is still one of my favorites."
2,disappointed,"He did not talk about "" Feminist"" part equally with the other , and he quoted lots of paragraph from Bible just try to declare "" such things are not aganist women ...."" these are not proofs of ""Both sides are right"" .The content doesn't fit with the Title.God did not create the man(Adam) and the woman(Eve) in the same way ! They are complemented but never be equal! Stop brainwashing us!"
3,A bit small but fits,The cap is a bit smaller than the original cap but it served its purpose which is to protect the lens.
1,sausage press is not a good design,"If there would have been a choice of no stars I would have chosen that.The press looks good in pictures, but the practical design is not good.The nozzles do not fit properly, they do not attach to the press in a secure manner. The press ram does not fit into the meat cylinder tightly enough.Therefore, the press meat(s) squeeze out improperly through unintended gaps, making a big mess.The unit will also need to be mounted to a board, or a table/counter top to allow the proper leverage to push the ram through."
4,good book,wow at first i thought this book sucked but after i looked at the tabs and listened to some of the songs again i realized it caught alotta notes that i never even heard before. good tabs
3,still learning,"I am still in the process of reading this material. some of themedical aspects I do not understand but I want to know as much asI can about Hemochromatosis so I can deal with it. I am trying tosee if my eating habits will be helpful to bring down my number which is extremely high. I do appreciate that such material is availableto the public, I understand that more and more people are being toldthat they have this problem. I have recently purchased a cookbook on this subject which has proven most helpful."
5,Anne Osborn- Pocket Radiologist (Brain),"In my opinion, this is one of the top publications in this field. Anne Osborn does a very good job in covering the many possible radiologic findings of the brain."
2,Day of Fire,"I was disappointed in this book. Like another reader who has posted a review, I was expecting great things after the initial book in the series, The Legend of Banzai Maguire by Susan Grant. I adore Susan Grant's books and intend to read them all. However, this book is dreary and very slow-moving, kind of like Ethan Frome in the 23rd century, and I have had to force myself to finish it so I could move on with the series. There is very little interesting or likable about either one-dimensional character other than being hard-working and dedicated. The novel cries out for romance, tender words, humor, and at least a few more sympathetic or interesting characters. Even the main villain is boring and forgettable. This almost seems like a book written by a man, lots of action and confrontational dialogue, interspersed with occasional bouts of lusty sex with no romance. Hopefully the next book in the series, by Liz Maverick, is more my style."
2,JUST FOR DIE HARD FANS.,"I love AC/DC, but I'm realistic enough to know that they are already past their prime, mainly since Brian Johnson began to lose his voice or at least the power to scream in tone.NO BULL shows AC/DC with a majestic stage production: everything including bells, cannon, an inflable doll, an elevator in the middle of the corwd for Angus; Phil Rudd playing as hard as never before.But the edition.... God, what was the director thinking? It is so fast and cold, when can't get a general view of the show. And to stand Brian's voice all the way is a real ordeal..."
2,Wagner would roll in his grave!,"I have been all of my adult life involved in the production of Grand Opera and therefore am qualified to make this statement....In regard to this production...BUY a CD instead....The whole scenic concept of Tristan is destroyed like an atomic bomb was dropped on it....To be very kind....For those of us, who have over the years, seen the romantic productions...This one is a waste of money and time....The works were written to fit within a time epoch...The music, Libretto, and the presentation were outlined by the composers as to production values as well as musical values ( especially this composer ), The set designer must be one of the young brats that wouldn't know romanticism if he were clobbered over the head with it...There's more to Opera than just singing and orchestra music... Here's good advice......Steer Clear of This Production if Eye Candy is as important to you as well sung portrayals of characters and good orchestral presentation...."
3,Infinitely Joyous,"I bought this cd for a few reasons - I love Bill Finn's work (Falsettoland, March of the Falsettos, A New Brain); I will buy anything that Norm Lewis sings on; and a friend told me I had to hear the one man version of the ""Baseball Game"" from Falsettoland.I am so happy that I bought this CD - it's amused and entertained me on roadtrips, skating trips in the park, and the privacy of my own bedroom. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Finn's."
2,Who has the kind of life to go hunting for ex boyfriends after 40???,"More to the point, who on earth even wants to go see what our ex boyfriends look like after 20 something years??? Come on already!This is an ultra light read that will soon be forgotten and never recommended.It's flat and full of voids, the characters are not really developed and I just didn't buy the whole plot here, if you can call it a plot that is.This is not the kind of book that will leave a print on your mind.... It didn't make me laugh out loud like Marian Keyes does every single time, nor did it entice me to find out more about the main character.In all honesty just another plain lifeless chick lit book I won't recommend to you."
3,Lightharded Read,"I found this book, among others from the author to be extremely predictable and unrealistic. While I enjoy lightharded summer reads, thats where this book ends. It was cute and funny. I wouldn't take the book too seriously. A nice, quick fairytale kind of story!"
3,Okay,"These hangers are very pretty and nice for sweaters, however the hanger part tends to separate from the rest of the hanger."
3,"A Fun Read, Especially Before The Next HP Movie Comes Out","Parts of this book were very informative, especially the information about J. K. Rowling and also the fictional concordance - a good place to look up names, spells, etc. I thought it was a good way to jog my memory before the next Harry Potter movie comes out. I especially liked the section with the trivia quiz. I think Harry Potter fans will enjoy testing their HP knowledge. I also thought the sketches were well done."
5,A great and easy read!,"I very much enjoyed this third edition of 'Muggles and Magic', and it's great to have a new, up to date issue! I disagree with reviewers who have written, 'This material is all available elsewhere'; that may be the case, but why spend hours searching for it in other volumes, websites or magazines (who has time for that??) when it's all been gathered together for you here? Mr Beahm has taken the time to compile an extensive volume which gives many interesting insights into the world of HP, the thoughts of J K Rowling and even the HP fan base and their activities! If you want a manual which covers all topics related to HP - books, collectibles et al - then this is the book for you! Kirk's illustrations are wonderful and they, together with some great photos, bring extra entertainment to the pages."
5,Lens hood,"I guess it's nice to have an extra one. It would have been nice if the ad for the lens had said one was included. It's possible that maybe after installing my wife's under cabinet TV with baling wire because the nuts broke loose from the cabinet top and requiring a number of beers to compose myself and be able to ignore her nibs, I misread the ad. The lens also came with a case which I also did not notice in the ad and ordered separately. Anyone one want to buy a lens hood, case and pair of 34mm filters, none of which I need for any of my my lens'. They're going for 25%off--what a deal."
5,The Good Moral to the Story is....,"If a good show teaches it's done the job well. That's what Davey and Goliath show did for me when I was a kid. Every Sunday I watched the program cause I loved the talking dog, Goliath. Doesn't that get a kid every time there's a talking animal around. It's ashame they don't have good animation that teaches a good message to kids. The kind that teaches them good morals, loving your neighbor, how important it is to care about our world and not giving into peer pressure. Each episode is based on the biblical principles of God.This contains eight episodes and are short in time length. So, it doesn't take a long time for the little ones to watch. The stories are to the point and don't take alots of time to get the message across. The shows may be a little 60ish decade but their lessons are timeless. If you're going to give a gift of entertainment to a child then I'd recommend a great ministering teacher like Davey & Goliath."
5,I like it,I think this pattern book is fun. I like that it is single sided and it has two sets of the same pattern. for those of us that need extra copies. I recommend it.
4,Just ok,"I have the same bag in green (with the multi-colored zipper) and although I like it and have used it a lot, I don't think it's anything really special. If anything, what makes this bag really nice is the big zipper. If you ever had any cosmetic cases with really cheap zippers, well, with this one, you won't need to worry about it needing a fix. Could be bigger."
5,Let yourself be taken away to magical places,"Mike Rowland has created some of the sweetest music on the planet! This cd brings you into his magical world. Put it on and allow yourself to be transported to the fairy realm. Whether I have company or just want to unload the stresses of the day, this cd provides plenty of gorgeous melodies to allow myself to drift."
4,The funky mintek,I tried this tv its okay once the channels wouden't come up so we buyed a new piece.I broke the cable recciver so i returned.I would suggest to put it on your buy list but maybe not bye it until you like it.Please rate this a 4
3,A good game but not on my top 15.,"Everyone is saying this game is [junk]. All of you are trying to group together. This game is good. Graphics are SOMETIMES 2-D. Gameplay is good,tons of modes. This game is good buy it and don't listin to everybody else."
1,Breaks Easily,"The small plastic grips that hold this eyecup in place break easily. I have had two of them break, and then the eyecup slips off very easily. Canon needs to replace the plastic grips with metal or make the plastic thicker. I recommend you seek an alternative to this product, though I have not yet found one."
5,Replacement Eyecup,I was excited to see this on Amazon. Great quality and it saved me $15 from buying at a small local store.
5,what I ordered and the best price,A good product at a good price. One order and every thing arrived on time. Jerry
2,funny fit and uncomfortable,"I ordered this ring in a small size and discovered upon receiving it that it was very uncomfotable to wear. The over all shape of the ring in the small size was more oval than round, making it strange to feel between my fingers: the hole for the finger was round, the ring itself oval. I sent it back. It also seemed to me that the diamonds were awfully yellow for their stated color grade."
5,This is a wonderful DVD.,My Favorite Broadway - The Love SongsThis is a wonderful DVD and it came very fast from the shipper and Iam looking forward to watching this as I originally had it on VHS andnow have changed formats to DVD.
1,"Great performance, bad producing","What an abundance of talent! What poor sound quality! :( This video would be a gem if the producers had put just a little bit more money into the recording equipment. Each time a performer sang, it came through the television as a mangled buzzing kind of noise. If you are looking to spend money on a Broadway video, buy ""My Favorite Broadway - The Leading Ladies"" not this video."
2,Julie forever...,"I really looked forward to this DVD, after the ""leading ladies"" version. That's why I only gave two stars. Mainly for Chita (too bad she was'nt allowed to or couldnt throw her legs in the air, but she's still got ist somehow).FUNNIEST MOMENT: Michael Mc Cormick and Michael Muheren (before this DVD unknown to me) are really very funny in their rendition of the original song ""BRUSH UP YOUR SHAKESPEARE"". I had to laugh out loud and actually applauded (sitting in front of my TV-set!) at the end of the song.EMOTIONAL MOMENT; Julie actually kinda sings two lines from ""THE RAIN IN SPAIN"". Not that she does it as she did before. But everybody seems so surprised and happy thas she more or less sings. I felt two tears rolling over face. The ovation of the crowd is really understandable.These two moments for me) are two very good reasons to buy this DVD. Although there are many other highlights, these two are the most important to me."
1,Completely Outdated,"This book is so outdated (make sure you fill out your application with a typewriter?) that most of the information is completely irrelevant. The writing and organization is a bit weak as well. The newer version (seems to be available only online) may have some updates but given my impression of this book overall, I think I'll skip it.On a side note, just FYI (since it's not mentioned anywhere in the description) - the book is for current undergraduates, not for those who have already graduated."
4,"Great book, well organized",It is a great read for information. I am still reading therefore I can't give a complete review.
4,Terrific Toronto,"This is a wonderful book filled with colorful pictures and interesting text. I expecially appreciated the way the author divided the book between house styles and neighborhoods. Toronto is blessed with wonderful neighborhoods and this book does a commendable job of giving a quick glace at each one. The photos are so vivid and the cross section of homes wonderfully selected. I really didn't know what to expect from this book and I was wonderfully surprised about the text on the different neighborhoods. Very well done, indeed."
5,Excellent Product-Gets the job done,"This grinder is a quality grinder which does a good job for a good price. My husband bought the grinder to make beef sticks in our food dehydrator, and he has forced me to eat so many beef sticks I'm considering becoming a vegetarian at this point! It grinds the meat fine, and he was able to grind with no trouble. OTOH, he works offshore and has a lot of upper body strength, so he was able to grind for over an hour without stopping. One point I would like to make about manual meat grinders is they don't grind much meat, since the amount of meat you can grind depends on your personal strength (among other factors). If you plan on grinding a great deal of meat or speed is an important factor to you, go ahead and invest the extra $30 or $40 on an electric meat grinder."
1,meat grinder,"This was not an electric meat grinder like we were looking for. I was disappointed, I would not have ordered it if I knew it was a hand crank type."
2,Cheap.,"Cheap and flimsy, legs already broken when I recieved package. Waited too long to open the box and find it broken, couldn't return it."
2,Rip Off,$22.00 for a molded piece of plastic? Yes it is a rip off! But it does attach to the camera no problems.
2,Not worth the money,"The transaction went fine. The product is comparatively far over priced. I was almost ""drummed out"" of an organization where I am the secretary, for spending that much on this item. We have a competitor's product for half the price, that rivals this Sony ICD-BM1 Recorder. Don't buy it!"
1,Watch your pricing!,Started to order this item at the listed price of $299. On checkout the price was $320 - plus $22 more for handling and shipping.
2,A story all over the map,"The title of the book implies to me a very specific topic: how to tell good stories, for better leadership, in a business setting. The first two chapters warm up nicely to that idea. I started off rather encouraged. Unfortunately that appears to be where the author reached the end of his storytelling knowledge because a large portion of the book veers off into leadership styles, branding, group dynamics, etc. He connects it all with the word ""story,"" and while I understand how a brand can be, metaphorically, a company's ""story"", its really not storytelling. Its a lot of meandering chapters using the word ""story"" in ways that aren't particularly insightful and distracting from the main topic. Really I blame the editor or the publisher. Its bad enough that they should have caught it and given him some advice. Look elsewhere for storytelling techniques."
3,Good stuff but bad writing style,"Instead of filtering information and writing it appropriately, the author keeps quoting financial planners and their opinions about different topics. These opinions are often not well fundamented, repetitive, biased by self-experience or contradicting each other, in a way that it makes reading very difficult and boaring. It took me weeks to finish the book. It has useful (although basic) information for people thinking of starting in financial planning, but contend could be condensed in 20% of the pages."
3,Ascept ratio,"I feel like this should of been half off, like the movies. I feel there all pan and scan. I HATE pan and scan!!!!!! Still, amazing films but the picture. Also the quality is better with better case design covers"
5,Well worth it,"Five of Kubrick's top ten or so in one box, with oodles of extras and long interviews with Stanley and others -- this is a top-notch collection. Well worth the price, the extras alone are worth the price. I owned three of the five before I bought the set, but owing to the extras I'm very happy I bought the set. (Plus now I have ""loaners"")"
1,Fits snugly,Well made and fits well with the lens. Plastic feel but otherwise do exactly what its intended purpose. Use it almost just slightly angled against the light and did not manifest even the faintest light spill.
1,Prickly Pear Syrup -,"I was soo excited to get this prickly pear syrup because I had wanted to make a pricky pear juice drink and this was the closest I could find. I put club soda in with this syrup and didn't get the taste I was hoping for. It's way TOO sweet and just not as good as I had hoped. I am disappointed,"
4,As advertised,"I ordered the prickly pear syrup to make margaritas, it arrived on time well packaged. I made margaritas with the syrup (although people say you should use prickly pear juice) they where a hit. every one loved them."
5,EMBRACING YOUR FATHER,"As a psychologist and author of ""Embracing Your Father: Building the Relationship You Want with Your Dad"", I teach daughters how to create more meaningful relationships with their fathers - especially after their parents divorce. I applaud this book for helping children through the difficult times after their parents divorce. Dr. Linda Nielsen author of ""Embracing Your Father"""
2,Quick and boring,"Although this was a fast read, it did not hold my attention. The story line and characters were boring and I could not wait to be done with the book."
1,appalling propaganda,"Nothing like getting 'em while they're young! This reminds me a lot of WWI and WWII propaganda, which is really not surprising, given that we're in a world where W and his cronies have pronounced that they will attack ""preemptively"" wherever, whenever and for whatever reason. Sustaining support for such a plan for total world domination is going to take a lot of propaganda of various types - this being an example of a less subtle kind. This book would be hilarious, if it weren't for the fact that many people actually seem to swallow this tissue of noxious **** and will attempt to indoctrinate they're kids with it."
1,I was slighly disappointed...,"Where was the racism, the lack of affordable health care? How about greedy CEOs and hypocritcal children's book writers?I guess some people ignore other American values. Like I'm gonna trust the wife of a former corporate CEO. Sorry, Jim. I don't drink the grape Kool-Aid..."
1,S is for the Stripping of Rights by my Husband,"All I can say is that this is not only a bad book for children, unimaginative and poorly written, but one can only assume the worst from a Vice-President's wife who has the gall to write, ""N stands for the Native Americans who CAME here first."" Sure, Lynne, they CAME here first, so it was okay to strip them of the land because that is the ethic of property acquisition. Gad...two more years to endure of this nonsense."
1,"lynnve v. cheney, wife of vp cheney.",vp cheney was ceo of haliburton which ripped off thousands ofamerican citizens under his leadership. why doesn't someonewrite an expose' of cheney and the bush administrations part in the enron tragedy? if this was a democrat administration they wouldn't be able to say 'boo' without being subpoenad by the republican jerks. like hillary clinton was. I am offended thatvp cheneys wife is making more money off of little kids. I'm not surprised though.
3,Reply to Vancouver B.C.,I think that any chance a child gets to learn about the history of our great country and any/all struggles that fellow americans have gone through to get us where we are today is wonderful...history is history no matter what political affiliation you are.
3,"Great price, poor quality","My kids love this toy. However it broke very quickly, with very gentle use. I guess you get what you pay for. I would suggest spending a bit more to get a similar product that will last."
4,Perfect portable fun!,"I purchased this toy for my 2 year old son. We do a lot of trips with our RV - both desert and beach camping and thought this would be an easy, portable toy for him to play with. Not only was this toy a hit with my son, all of the other kids in our camp wanted to play with it, too. The toy looks a little over-whelming to put together when you first pull the pieces out of the box; however, it is actually very easy and I probably had it put together within about 20 minutes. I think it is a little cheaply made but for the price, fun and convenience for travel - it was well worth the purchase! I'm very happy with this toy."
1,Egregious mistakes,"In the chapter ""Numerical Ability,"" the book incorrectly solves the sample problem, Calculate: (3/4)(7 + 13) / 4(3 * 2) + 15. It makes two egregious mistakes: it misstates the rule of precedence and then even incorrectly applies its own rule. This gives the wrong answer, 0.3846.In the same chapter under the section ""Order of Operations,"" it incorrectly states that multiplication takes precedence over division and addition takes precedence over subtraction.By the way, the correct answer is 37.5 and multiplication and division have equal precedence, as do addition and subtraction."
1,waste of money,"Pump died the first time I used it. Received replacement pump, it died before I completed pumping 1 gallon of peanut oil. This pump is not worth the money, very poor quality. Eastman should be ashamed to sell such low quality junk. I will never buy a product again with their name on it."
1,Used this pump once and it died while it was pumping out,"What a joke, not worth the money. I put it in the container to pull out the oil and it dies half way through. Swapped batteries, pulled it out, washed it and looked at all the parts. It was either used and resold to me by amazon, or it was defective from the start. And since they have a 30 day return policy, I am now stuck with it, I will see what eastman says next. VERY disappointing, I will go back to the old way of just pouring it into a funnel with a coffee filter in it."
4,Good bang for the buck,"The pump works well, certainly as good as can be expected for the excellent price! It does, however, leave at least an inch of oil in the bottom of the pot. The instructions say that this last bit of oil is too dirty, and it is best discarded. In reality, the design of the pump just doesn't allow it to suck oil up from that low a level. I was, however, able to sufficiently filter most of these last few cups of oil using the pump and a large-mouth jar. When poured into a jar with a much smaller diameter, the oil is deep enough that the pump can get to it, leaving only a small amount that I didn't mind discarding."
1,Does not work,"I returned this product almost as soon as I recieved it. It did not work the first time we tried it. I read many multiple reviews before purchasing and obviously should have paid closer attention to everyone's dissapointment. In conclusion, a piece of junk."
1,Missing DVD,"Very Dissappointed I ordered this as a gift only because this came with the ""Bonus DVD"" It arrived today with the sleeve for the DVD empty in the back of the book. I will be filing a claim if a DVD is not shipped to me... I paid $40.00 with expedited shipping for a paperback book to be missing the part I wanted most"
3,The TV show is much better,"Listened to the audiobook of this ... Joe Mantegna sounded a lot like how Timothy Olyphant talks in the TV show, which was pretty awesome. :-D This short story takes place right before the events depicted in the pilot episode of the TV show. In fact, the shooting scene from the first episode is one of the last scenes in this book."
4,Good stuff!,"This is the characterization that is so often missing from crime novels today. They are REAL people who happen to get caught up in some crazy stuff.I liked the pacing and the dialog is the best that is out there, bar none. They talk like real people, not like tag lines in a movie script.A great introduction to a different type of crime novel."
3,Nothing special,"I love the tv show Justified and I love crime fiction and this author is acclaimed by some as ""America's premier crime novelist"". So, I should really like this book, shouldn't I? The problem is that this is just a mediocre book. Nothing terribly bad, but nothing especially good. So-so plot, so-so storytelling. Just a waste of time considering there are lots of good books to be read and I can't seem to get to them all.If you want to read some good crime fiction, I'd recommend Pelecanos. If you're happy with this quality material, there's plenty of it."
3,Short screws,"This product comes with #10-24 x 1/2"" screws which turned out to be too short for my Rival crock-pot. Fortunately, I have a hardware store close by that sold me #10-24 x 3/4"" screws that did the trick."
5,perfect!,"these worked perfect for every lid I needed replacement knobs for! They were different types of lids, one which was a ""hand me down"" from my Mother-in-law, so it was an old lid"
1,Poor quality - Do not buy,"Echoing other reviews on this product.2 big problems with this product:- The screws are too short to accommodate replacement of a knob for an enameled lid.- The plastic threads within the knob itself are weak and broke. Yes I over tightened, but not that much.Spend more and get a better product."
2,Doesn't Fit All,"I needed to replace two pot handles and thought this product would be perfect. But for the handles to fit right, you have to use the screws that come in the package. The screws in my pot lids can't be removed and they're much narrower than the ones that fit these knobs. I finally made it work by filling the holes in the knobs with plastic wood and letting that dry for 24 hours. But they don't really feel secure."
3,Good but missing something,"I love Basie, I love Bond - perhaps because this was recorded early on in the Bond phenomenon, is because it's missing some ""oomf"" - too much of the music - played by this - the swinginest of bands - sounds like a board group of cocktail party musicians. Worth having on many levels but didn't reach my expectations."
5,A surprisingly awesome series,"This mini-series was amazingly addictive, and I'm very disappointed that right now it's only available in this format, as I'd like a physical DVD.Jamie Chung as Heaven was badass, and is a great actress. (Also loved her as Chi-Chi on the Dragon Ball: Evolution movie.) The story was deep and really pulled you in, and the romance was sweet with only a tiny bent of the tragic. Loved it, PLEASE put it to regular dvd soon?"
3,What is this product description looking at?,"Home - good song, better off the album thoughDenial (remix by expansion union) - just has a few industrial noises chucked over the top of the originalWaffle (remix by expansion union) - not bad, as much of the guitar stripped back and some industrial drumming addedWaffle (remix by Dj lethal) - very nice remix, if your familiar with Dj lethals work you know what to expect, dark sounding versionprayer (live) - very good live version much like the waffle single live versions.Overall an ok single, the remixes improve as you move through the cd but the waffle single is much better."
3,"Fun, Works Well, but Beware!","Finally, a full-featured labeler at the right price. Brother brought the price way down (it's also 49.99 at Staples or OfficeMax) to where it belongs. Tons of whistles and bells and a lot of fun to use. Makes labeling anything a snap. BUT.....as usual, KEEP YOUR WALLET OPEN! The manufacturer designed this thing to nail you on the back end. The tapes to keep this thing running are expensive. In addition, another prime example of my biggest pet peeve, NO ADAPTOR!!!! Why Brother, and everyone else, tries to grossly overcharge for these things is an insult. That alone brings my rating to three stars instead of four."
2,Not Very Helpful,The vocabulary cards had three words per card - I would have preferred oneper card so I could divide the words I knew from those I needed to learn.The math cards had solutions but no explanations. I did not find them useful.
4,The life of a writer is not as boreing as we have thought.,"The life of a writer is not as boreing as we have thought. In his autobiography ""Bio of an Ogre"" Piers Anthony puts his own special twist and spin on things. By writing his own story he managed to get the whole story out in a style unique only to him. He depicts his story starting with his first memories, and finally ending just after his fiftieth year. He tells how his family moved from place to place untill he finally moved to America and started writing. Of course his works got rejected time and again untill his first publication and his first love. From then on he explains his stories and the stories behind them. Including Xanth, the Adept series, and Bio of a Space Tyrant. Along with many other works he has become one of the number one best sellers in America and in Europe. So if you enjoy Piers Anthony or are looking for something different then try Bio of an Ogre I'm sure you'll enjoy it."
3,50 CENT (The best videos on DVD),"track listings: 21 questions, candy shop, disco inferno, get rich or die tryin, hate it or love it, how we do, in da club, just a lil bit, look at me now, bonafide hustler, many men, outta control, rowdy rowdy, stunt, wanksta, & ya life's on the line.i recieved this DVD in POOR CONDITION, but in REMARKABLE speed, the issues are as follows: the cover is VERY WORN, it is TORN at bottom edges along lineing, & there are DENTS & SCRATCHES on plastic front & back cover.i rated this seller a 3 (FAIR) for MISLEADING INFO. regarding condition of case itself, & NOT LISTINGS TRACKS/SONGS, as for the DVD itself is worth adding to your collection."
5,Any Fan Should Get This One!!,"Excellence is the word that describes this DVD the best. The picture quality, the sound quality, the band members and Mr. Klugh are all top notch on this one. I've been a fan of his for awhile but I really never had a desire to go see him in concert until now!! Any smooth jazz fan should get this DVD!!!"
4,Gamer from New York,"I truly love those realistic fighting games that use (somewhat realistic moves - without powerballs and glowing punches). For the most part, SC gives that. On the PSX, Soul Blade is an excellent game, and I love all the characters and their variety as well as the mission mode. While I feel SC is a great fighting game in the same way, I don't believe that the creators used the full power of the system. Perhaps some blood or bruising could have been added. Or perhaps just something that makes it a little more realisticl. I am not a sadist. I just believe that if you get a game system that has twice the power, that it should show up in the games. Don't get me wrong; it's a great game, but not as good as it could have or should have been."
5,The best fighting game since Tekken 3,"Soul Calibur is probably the best fighting game right now. The game has one of the best graphics I have ever seen. What makes Soul Calibur even greater is that it has so many options to keep you in the game for weeks or maybe even months. Soul Calibur takes awhile to master due to the amount of characters the game has, plus each character is not the same. If you buy a dreamcast, make sure you also get Soul Calibur!"
5,Of Beauty and of Greatness,"I simply cannot comprehend someone labeling this game less than five. Regardless of what some wagglers say the control is perfect, they say that a novice slapping buttons can beat them, and so it encourages that sort of gameplay. Well if you're an expert you can batter their weapon to the side and rip them to shreds. The characters are incredibly rendered, you can actually muse over their expressions, the backgrounds literally are beautiful. What more can one ask? this is the best that has ever arrived graphically, the control is excellent and the characters themselves are innovative and appealing, even Voldo in his own way. It makes everything short of FMVs look like cheap crap, and there is much to do... this game is worth buying the system for..."
5,3 Words: Best Game Ever,"Soul Calibur sets a new standard for fighting games. The animation is simply flawless, and the graphics are jaw-dropping. Soul Calibur has something for everyone. For button-mashers, you can select Kilik or Cervantes, and other people of that type will suit you fine. For more advanced players that like to study the moves list, select someone like Ivy or Maxi. The AI (Artifcial Intelligence) is somewhat of a dissapointment. True, if you up the difficulty level you will be given a challenge, but the enemy themselves don't really learn some techniques of some sort. The just learn to block, really, and that's basically how you might be defeated. Many fighting games demand an arcade joystick, but Soul Calibur is the direct opposite. Soul Calibur uses a unique fighting control style, with the new 8-way run system. You won't be dissapointed. All in all, I would give this game 10 star, though the maximum is 5. This game will give you thrills of fun, and won't get bored soon."
5,One of the Best Dc games,"This game is great, 1 or 2 player, many options, lots of moves, a cool and different fighting system from SF2 clones, use of weapons, Superub GRAPHICS, great sound, and addicting fun, this is a must have DC title."
5,Great Book!,This is a great tool for any Christian who is interested in deepening their relationship with God. It has helpful quoted scriptures that help you to remember that God is with us all the time. This is just such a great book and full of reminders that are so helpful in our daily yoga practice and life. I like the way the author was able to connect some of the Eastern Yoga principles with the teachings from the Bible in such an easy way to understand. I Highly recommend this book to everyone!
1,Nothing new,"I am an absolute fan of Suzanne Ciani. I basically have all her albums, so I was happy to find this new one. Unfortunatelly, it is just a compilation of themes already published, with absolutely nothing new. It is not even an ""all the best"" collection so people who do not know her can find out the best. Absolute waste of money."
5,This is one of my favorite movies!,"I loved this movie. Christopher Pettiet is so cute! I'm sure you'll love it too!! I just ordered it, but I've seen it already!"
5,"GREAT MIC, GREAT SERVICE, GREAT PRICE","MIC WORKS GREAT, LIKE ALL 58S DO...THE SWITCH WAS FINE AFTER READING COMMENTS ABOUT IT BEING CHEAP..IT SEEMS OK TO ME...."
4,It's a Shure thing,"The Shure SM58 vocal microphone is the only microphone I trust in the field and onstage. It captures live sound from interviewees and rock star singers in a crisp and clear manner without costing too much money. It's got a solid design, omnidirectional capture, and good pickup from a distance. Every broadcast news reporter and singer should be using this microphone for live-action sound. I wouldn't use it in the studio for recording or voice-overs unless you have to. You will be satisfied with this microphone--it's a Shure thing."
3,Great for Chefs - Not So Great for Cooks,"This is a fabulous vegetarian cookbook for people with a lot of time to cook and shop. To be fair, there are some simple recipes but precious few compared to the scope of this cookbook. I live in West Los Angeles and still need to go to several stores to get the ingredients for one recipe. This is not a book for home-style cooks, but for those who seek the upper echelons of chef-dom. Most recipes are labor-intensive for the average cook. Still, I expect to find a few good recipes within my range here. And the writer is a sweet soul - bless her ever shopping and cheffing heart!"
4,A lot of Book for the price,"I recently purchased this book and I have to say that I was shocked by the sheer volume of recipes. If you're into quantity you definitely get that from this book. So far I've only tried 1 recipe from this book, and I can't really say that I tried the recipe. I used the information in this book to roast beets, after that I sort of took my cues from my intuition about what would taste good. Which is something I think all cooks should do. The book is filled with tons of ideas and recipes, some actually look like they taste good, So would I recommend this book, said the person who has yet to use one full recipe from the book--Yes I would. I haven't come across anything in this book that made me stop and say I'm going to make that, but that's not the type of cook I am. I think this book would definitely be beneficial to most cooks who are looking for ideas, this book is full of them--that's worth the price of the book alone."
4,this is good.,"i have enjoyed this cookbook immensley. crecent is a touching writer as well as a great chef. so far i have tried the gorgous lasagna, the enchilidas with verde sauce, thai crystal, and millet burgers which have shredded beet in them and turn the loveliest pink i have ever seen. the boys in the house (mostly carnivores) have enjoyed the food as well. it is truley a LARGE book - don't be overwhelmed - the recipes are great and backed up by the valuable expertise of one who knows how to cook well."
5,Inspirational Passion,"I've had my copy of this book for about a year now, and I've made quite a few recipes out of it. Each one has been fantastic. And this book is huge, so there is so much to explore here! You could cook for years using this book alone and dine very well indeed. I've served the recipes to my omnivore friends and they have liked them too.The author does a good job of explaining the recipes and drawing attention to ways to save time, suggest alternatives, and ways to use the recipe in other ways.The author is personable and writes quite a bit--some have said she is ""wordy"". However, cooking well is more than following a set of ingredients and instructions. I personally find her narratives before each section and recipe entertaining and informative. It's like having the author as a friend, and sets the mood for the cooking to come.Highly recommended addition to your cookbook library!"
2,Unclear Information what you are buying,When I bought this box set it said I was getting a 12 disc set. The package arrived today and there was only 10 discs!! You need to clarify how many discs are in this set and which titles one is receiving!!
5,"Wonderful, deep, and spritually challenging!","This is a wonderful collection that will appeal to all those who want to learn more of how God deals with mankind as portrayed in the Old Testament. Each production is well portrayed, with an excellent choice of actors. For real gems!"
1,Dissapointed,"The movie was dry, boring and not to scripture. It left out a lot of facts about David's life and had plenty of boring parts. Don't waste your money."
3,First cinemascope western has epic sweep,"Length:: 5:52 MinsIt won an Oscar for Best Writing (Phil Yordan) and the great Katy Jurado was nominated as Best Supporting Actress. OTOH, films like ""High Noon"" and ""The Searchers"" come from the same era and are far superior IMO. Nonetheless, with its King Lear like plot it definitely warrants a look, especially if you are a Spencer Tracy fan."
4,It's a Desktop Fan,"It's a small fan that sits on your desktop / nightstand. It works. My only beefs are two:1. It only has 2 speeds. It'd be nice if it had a continuously variable speed.2. It does not pivot up or down. So on my nightstand, I have to prop up the back end so that the fan points lower.But it's cheap and does the trick. Worth the money, but not worth more money."
1,Noisy,"I bought this to use in a bedroom, and it is a nuisance. The controls are on the front, and there are two speeds--good qualities. However, the noise level cannot be alleviated, either by placing the fan on a mousepad, or a folded hand towel."
4,Must have for your collection.,Done with being serious? Laugh a little! A little cheesy but who doesn't love some cheese! Watch the pivotal movies it parodys than watch this movie.
2,No That Good,"I used this pedal for a couple years than switched to a T.Rex Roomate, which made me understand how horrible this sounded in comparison. I do like a lot of the Boss pedals but not this one."
2,Disappointment here!,This is not a quality product for the money! It is nothing more than a moisture swob! I would not recommend it.
5,Awesome Group,"They are one of my favorate groups. Flooded with talent and creativity, this cd is a must have! The lyrics are amazing and the music is original.BTW, the lyrics for ""Living is Simple"" are: Is this fiction, is this fiction, Hope has given himself to the worst.Isn't that awesome, though? Hope has given Himself to the people who deserve it the least! How awesome is God?"
4,Switchfoot's best CD yet!,"Learning To Breathe is an excellent album. The members in the band have great talent. I find all of the songs well done and uplifting. Whether you've gotten the other two albums and are wondering about this one, or have just heard of Switchfoot, this is a good one to get. In my opinion, it is their current best album. And to all of you Switchfoot fans out there, a new album is comin' out Jan. 21, 2003. The album is called ""The Beautiful Letdown."" If this one is as good or better than Learning To Breathe or New Way To Be Human, you can expect great things from it. Anyway, I highly recommend this album! also look at New Way To Be Human!"
3,A nice Sunday drive,"If you are looking for a a good book that compliments the first ""Rig Warrior"" book this is not it. I absolutly enjoyed the first book, but this one needs to bee rethought out. I felt Barry ""Dog"" Rivers could have gotten a little deeper into the situation that was going on in the town this story was set in. It was interesting to find out what he went through after the ending of the first book, but again I didn't feel his presence here as in the first installment. Hopefully the third book will be an exciting conclusion to this series. If you have read the first book and are planning on reading the third go ahead a check this one out. I'm sure some of the informatin that we are given here will come to play in the third."
4,Wheels,"Good action story and romance without the intimate details. some things are best left to the imagination. Fast paced - altho you can figure out where it is going, you can still hardly wait to get there."
4,A very enjoyable book,"I read the Pilot's Wife, and just finished The Weight of Water. In Anita Shreve's books, there really aren't any surprises. The stories are predictable, and from a lesser writer, would be dissapointing. So, despite the fact that an attentive read will unravel the plot very early, you will still keep reading. Anita Shreve has a remarkable gift for making you feel what her characters feel."
4,An Amazing Ending - a very emotional story,"Thos book has so much going on in it; I love the way Shreve switches back between Maren's letters and what is going on in the narrator's life. The historical parts of this story (the murders, the trial, the evidence) make it a great read for anyone who enjoys crime/mystery.The ending shocked me - and while I dont want to ruin it for anyone - I must say I was not expecting it to end that way for Jean. Maren, well, I guessed at that somewhere in the middle.Anita Shreve is becoming one of my ""it"" authors - I hope she continues to provide such excellent novels as ""The Weight of Water"" and ""The Pilot's Wife"""
3,WHAT WAS SHE TRYING TO DO,"A BOOK HAS NEVER IRRITATED ME AS THIS ONE DID. THE TWO STORIES WERE FINE BUT SHE WENT BACK AND FORTH AT WILL. IT IS AS IF SOMEONE LIFTED WHOLE PARAGRAPHS AND JUST DUMPED THEM WHEREVER. IF THIS IS SOME SPECIAL LITERARY TECHNIQUE IT WAS POORLY DONE. EACH STORY WAS VERY COMPELLING, TOGETHER OR SEPARATELY. I DIDN'T EXPECT THE ENDING TO TODAY'S STORY. I DID FIGURE OUT THE MURDER FROM THE PAST."
2,a dissapointment,"I wanted to read Anita again because I loved her book ""The Pilot's Wife"". This book had some interesting characteristics but it took forever for me to get me hooked, unlike her other book. Once I read to the middle of the book I figured I better finish it, the end was weird, didn't make any sense. And as a mother, the loss of her child didn't seem real, she wasn't affected as I thought she would. It was an ok read, but it didn't compare at all to her ""The Pilot's Wife"". Her sentence structure I found to be really confusing."
3,not overly impressed,"i was looking forward to this book after i had read the pilot's wife. i found this book confusing with changing of time and situation fast and inconsistent. i also knew the twists well before they happened. not too impressed. i read to the end but skimmed a lot (the detail was laborous).if you haven't already, read the pilot's wife...it's much better and less predictable"
3,took too long to read such a short book,"I read this because I enjoyed Pilot's Wife & filming on Weight of Water is taking place on the outskirts of my city. I enjoyed the switching back from present to past, although I would have preferred more ""past""; clever how the language changed. Overall, a pretty boring book, sadly; I was hoping for more. Sean Penn, Elizabeth Hurley & Sarah Polley star in the film. Now, we have to guess who plays who. How about Penn as the ""murderer,"" Hurley as Adeline, Polley as Maren?"
5,helainebinstock&yahoo.com,"Easy-to-read, flowing prose. On photo-essay assignment off coast of New Hamshire, to reasearch a brutal l871 murder, narrator juxtaposes past with present. Familiar passions and emotions, clearly described, makes for mezmerizing reading."
4,"interesting and well written,","The style is engaging, the story fascinates with a comfortable pace. Based on a true event, this piece of fiction is an easy read. One feels as though they have been to the coastal area, sat in the tiny village library and smelled the sea breezes. The androgyny of the characters is a minor flaw. The male character's dialog often sounds like something only a female would say. Thus, one does not forget this is fiction and get absorbed in the historical perspective of this mysterious crime. The author does not choose to horrify the reader with needlessly graphic descriptions of the violence. This is a good book."
2,I didn't hate this book--I just didn't like it!,"I really liked Anita Shreve's ""The Pilot's Wife"" so thought that ""The Weight of Water"" would be another interesting read. Was I wrong! The book is boring and depressing--both the present story and the one that took place in 1885. Whenever I read a book, I like to be moved; either to tears or laughter. But, there is no laughter in this book--not even a smile. When I finished this book I needed something light and happy; you will too!"
3,"beautifully written, interesting dual storyline","I found ""The Weight of Water"" by Anita Shreve to be an enoyable read for many reasons. The prose was lovely and the parallel story lines interesting. The setting was reminiscent of another favorite, ""Shipping News"" (Annie Proulx) with the powerful forces of nature and the sea a playing an integral part of the characters development."
2,Two storylines that at times leave the reader confused.,"The writing style was totally different from ""Pilot's Wife"". Was disappointed that so much time was spent telling a historical story when I expected a current story line with just references to the 19th century events. Had to force myself to finish the book in hopes it would get better. --"
5,Suspenseful; Another great one from Anita Shreve!,The Weight of Water is full of suprising turns of events and is guaranteed to keep the reader's interest. Anita Shreve is a great storyteller and proves herself with this book.
3,3.5 stars,"I enjoyed this book. It was dark, which I like. At first I was put off by the writing style of Maren's letters, but I got used to it quickly. I do wonder: did Maren & Evan have an incestuous relationship? And did Adaline & Thomas NOT have an affair? I am disappointed in the whole Billie thing (don't want to spoil it), I just didn't see the point."
4,Magma,"I loved how seamlessly the narrative moved between Jean's and Maren's stories, how at first they sparked off of each other in momentary connections, and then melded.Jean's and Maren's matter-of-fact voices bely the molten activity beneath the surface of both until the killing eruptions break through."
2,Good Overview; Poor Quantitative Examples,"This book presents a good, functional overview of networking and current technologies. However is does a very poor job of providing any quantitative examples in the chapters. As a result, the exercises at the end of each section are near impossible, and require a good amount of guess work. There are also several typos in the book."
1,Not worth the paper its printed on,"I have to first say I read The prison, and enjoyed its spookyiness so much I tried this one. Ok I was kinda lost cause I didnt know what happened to get them here from the first book,however, I stopped reading this book after 100 tiresome pages of masturbation! This seems to be one of Gates' keys to writing as I will not read anymore of his books since sex seems to have to be written into every other scene! Also its clumsy sex, unneccessary to go into such detail, and boring. His attempts at putting in fairy tales is also clumsy and seems old hat. Sorry Gates is so stuck on sex, his book the Prison seemed so promising but then he lost me as a reader."
1,Pitiful attempt at horror,"I thought only movie producers made the mistake of thinking gory scenes were a good substitute for true horror, but I was wrong. If you remove the sick, gory scenes from this book, all you would be left with would be sick, perverted sex scenes. If you enjoy sexual depravity involving incest and 13-year old kids with a generous helping of cannibalism and child torture thrown in for kicks, this is the book for you. Otherwise, steer clear! I couldn't even finish it, and that almost never happens."
5,The Ultimate Sports DVD,"Wow, all of the Jordan videos and a whole bunch of features for such a cheap price!! This is a must buy for any Jordan fan, for any true NBA fan. First of all, it includes all the videos from Come Fly with Me, Michael Jordan's Playground, Airtime, Above and Beyond and a new one His Airness. Then to top it all of, it includes all of Michael's best plays ( dunks, assists, moves ), a documentary on his shoes, highlights from his eight greatest games, a musical tribute and whole bunch of DVD rom features that I haven't had the chance to go over because I lack a DVD-rom in my computer."
4,Quick review of Funeral sans color,"The quality of the reporting is clear and very informative. However, this disc gives only the three main speeches made at the ceremony and little of the ceremony itself. It includes none of the music, neither choral or soloists like Elton John. Thus, I found it to be a good summary of the event but not the event itself."
3,Postal..A good bargain game,"Good graphics/levels. Gets a little boring though. Hard to play through. Bad loading areas which take away from the game. Buy it if you're between games and need a quick, funny fix.."
1,Too Violent,"I really like first person shooters like Far Cry, MOHAA, and Call of Duty. But Postal 2 has gone way too far. This game is so violent it is sick. I really like shooters, but this game is so violent you would have to be messed up in the head to buy it. I feel bad for anyone who needs this game."
4,Works well for what I needed,"For basic household use in Home & Hobby P-Touch, I am satisfied with quality and performance. Can be difficult to separate tape from backing paper, but not impossible."
2,Brother M231 Labeling Tape-1/2 inch width,"This stuff is great. My wife and I use it to label things we don't use often so we can tell at a glance what is in a box or what a bottle contains. It goes into the labeler without a fuss and works the first time every time. The glue on the back (once the backing is peeled) requires the the surface be dirt and oil free or it will eventually come off. The printing will ""wear off"" if you are using it in a high friction environment such as on a book in a backpack. However, it lasts long enough that whatever it is on becomes habit and the label is no longer necessary.BTW, if I did not have fingernails, I could not peel the backing off without using a large paperclip. There ought to be suggestions from Brother about the best way to get the backing started off the label."
2,Not the same as the TZ,"Just some clarity - I bought this since it came up with the search for TZ P Touch tape, but it doesn't fit my machine. Now ordering what I really need."
1,Chen-ge your mind quick,"Mr Walken again. He spends the entire sorry picture trying to swat away flies. When not succumbing to Mr Walken's desperate attempts to distract us from his gravity defying hair, we witness lesbian sex scenes, drug taking and an attempted male rape over a sofa. I left the cinema in disgust. I mean, where was Hayley Mills?"
1,Or less.,"This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. And that's pretty bad considering I sat through Killer Clowns From Outer Space. The rape scene is disgusting. Ann Heche is pretty skank, too. I find it impossible to care about the main characters. Everything in this film is such a cliche. Ugh. If you're looking for lesbian love scenes (as it appears a majority of you are), rent Bound. Or, for something quite erotic between two girls, watch the belly-kissing scene in All Over Me. I mean, it gets me..."
3,"A for effort, A+ for Erotic!","Ann Heche and her little booty will make you shiver and quiver. Though not much of a story ever develops, and Chris Walken fails to impress, Heche's hot scenes make this an erotic thriller for the ages. Heche is fine, and though the plot may suffer, the film is a revealing look (no pun intended) at a star in the making."
3,More of the Same,"The seventh in Bruce Alexander's series about blind 18th century London magistrate Sir John Fielding, who is a real historical character. ""The Color of Death"" is the story of a series of burglaries apparently committed by a gang of black men. Like the six books that came before, it is a quick and fun weekend read. Not deep, not thoughtful, not even terribly mysterious as far as pop mysteries go. It's straightforward and forgettable. Enjoy it in a hammock."
1,"Terrible Lightgun, simply awful.","The feel to this lightgun is very clunky and cheap, and thesight doesn't work!!! Even after shooting at the center of screen to line the gun up, it still is terrible!!! The Double Barrel front makes it heavier than it should be, and it has a very uncomfortable feel to it. Definately not a worthy purchase."
2,Need better gun!,"HOD2 is the reason we bought Dreamcast, so it's very disappointing to have to live with this gun, which doesn't shoot where you aim it. I'm told the Mad Katz gun is better, so I'm going to return my Interact and go in search of it."
3,Thrust,"Soft porn movie at best. It try to be a lower version of the Fast and the Furious. The overall plotline is not existent. The actor do a good job with the material they have to act on. I would recommend this movie if you like hot chicks, fast cars, and adult situations."
1,What in the ?,"I rented this from a local rental store called ""videoscene"" it was sitting next to the regular movies. I mean no adult section nothing! Just sitting there right on the shelf next to the other action movies. I'm heavy into racing and cars, and picked this up because I thought it was a real movie. This was nothing but some long made for TV late night cinemax porno. As far as a soft core porno goes it rarely needs a real story or a logical plot. This one obviously had neither. The girls looked good better than looking at those boring cars."
4,Watched this way too many times,This is one of those movies that no one knows about that I absolutely loved. I've since lost my copy.. well maybe I'll order another right now :D
4,Great transaction...good product,"The transaction was timely and the product was in good condition. The product itself, while meant for new believers, is still a moderately good book for discipleship purposes, introducing the BASICS of Scripture study, hiding the Word of the One True God in our hearts, prayer, and fellowship. While I do not agree with all the methodology in the book (such as marking upon His written Word...even a translation), the book as a whole covers the necessary basic practices of growing in one's knowledge of the Holy One of Israel."
5,love my guy,got these for my boyfriend sometime i wish i didn't he watches all the time he love rocky next is a DVD player for me he can have the old one to take to his man cave glad i got them for he anyway he loves them
4,WOULD OF BEEN PERFECT IF THAY DIDN'T MAKE THE 5TH ONE,MY OPINION OF THE ROCKY SERIS.ROCKY 1 WARNING FOR ALL CHRISTIANS THIS MOVIE HAS BAD SWEARING. MY RATING 2 OUT OF 5ROCKY 2 OKAY MOVIE GOOD TRAINING SCENE BASICALLY A REMAKE OF THEOF THE FIRST ONE WIHOUT BAD SWEARING. MY RATING 3 OUT OF 5ROCKY 3 GOOD MOVIE. FGHITS WERE A LITTLE SHORT.

MY RATING 4 AND HALF OUT OF 5ROCKY 5 THE WORST IN THE SERIS BAD MOVIE WITH BAD SWEARING MY RATING 0 OUT OF 5
5,Love them,We love watching these movies at home. They never get old and we can't wait to watch them over and over again.
4,Discs are In better condition than Box,"I was wary about the quality of the movie when I saw the cover box. The cover box wasn't too bad, just a little worn. But once I scanned through the movie, the quality proved to be good condition. The only thing was that, inside the Rocky V case was another Rocky IV disc. However, once I contacted the seller, they were quick to apologize and send a replacement. Everything works and looks perfectly."
5,Rocky,I my significante other loves Rocky and he loves the Anthology I bought him for Christmas. What a great gift at a great price.
3,"Pleasing, but not what you'd expect","While this book is not in a format which would allow the reader to find a specific word for something he/she is trying to express, it is full of many uncommon and delightful words. I recommend it only as an influence for those willing to learn new words."
3,No Remorse,"Not sorry at all about buying this. Sean seems to have worked and polished this to the point his dad would be very proud.Really didn't know what to expect, never hearing anything from Sean before. From all the Beatles' boys I've heard, Sean seems far ahead musically.Looking forward to anything Sean creates in the future (as long as it doesn't include his mom's screaming!)"
4,Great little buy,"I was in the market for a lens hood for my new camera. I was reading some reviews on some copys/knock offs for the canon lens I had. After reading, some people werent happy with the actual product of the copys/knock offs, so I just end up spending a little bit more money and get the real deal. It was a good buy and worth the money."
3,An OK Read,"I'm a big Wendy Corsi Staub fan, but I didn't think this was one of her best efforts.There were too many separate things happening, and it took far too long to tie them all together, which made the book jump around all over the place and become confusing. There were also a very limited number of characters, which meant that even if you couldn't figure out who the guilty party was from the storyline (which was fairly easy to do), you could pretty much figure it out by process of elimination since there weren't many choices. Most of the main characters didn't come across as particularly likeable or intelligent, which also made it hard to feel for any of them.A decent enough read, but by far not her best work."
5,this cd I play over and over,"This group I just found recently and instantly I was drawn in. Sea of Doubts is my favorite song I think. Look to Me, Hold on Love and These White Lights Will Bend to Make Blue are also really great songs as well. These songs I can listen to over and over..I love these songs."
2,Not pleased with the book!,"The copy was a little beat up, the cover any how. So next time I'll buy brand new.Yada Yada A little yellow pages."
5,I Love this lotion!,"I've always been a fan of Austrailian gold products, especially the Tan Extender. I love the smell of this lotion and it really keeps your skin hydrated and your tan looking great! I would defintely recommend this product!"
1,not received,Actually I did not get until today this item Australian Gold Moisture Lock Tan Extender 16 oz. Pump.Mas Accelerator and perfume have reached a little while. I wonder why?? the lotion was not purchased on the same day.
3,Liked it but not tearfree,I got the lotion for my toddlers. we liked the smell but it was not tear free. I would not recommend for baby or toddler.
4,I like no matter what...,"I like this album because this is the music that I grew up listening to. I heard it being played when MOM was cleaning the house, when PACO and I ran around in the studio, and when DAD would be practicing it to make it perfect. These are the only memories I have of him, and I wish that everyone would share them with me. Xavier Pasos is a great man and a terrific father that I wish I could have been closer to. If he himself ever reads it, Papi, yo te quiero mucho y nunca pasa un dia que no pienso en ti."
1,Not the Best Book,"This is definitely not the best book I've read on Manufacturing. The preface and preview pages tell the reader that this book was especially designed and written for independent study, but I found the text confusing and poorly edited. New terms and concepts are introduced without explanation. Mistakes are everywhere. Even working the exercises at the end of each module left me feeling that I had missed the point of the chapter. A novice will get something from this book, but only if they really work at it. And even then they may be more confused than when they started."
3,Bulky,"it's a nice looking watch has alot of features only if you fly a plane or travel out of the time zone alot, you really can't hear the alarm, you can't see the features it in day light,it has a button the makes it glow for dark areas the only problem you have to hold the button in because once you let go of the button it goes out so if you're setting something you have to hold one button in while pushing another button. and the watchis very bulky I keep banging it on things because sticks out, I took it to the pawn shop ( not to sell) to see what I can get for it and they wouldn't offer me anything for it they didn't want it but it is a nice looking watch for the price"
4,Just what I hoped it would be - good value!,"I've had the watch for a week now and I'm very happy with it. Both digital and analog time are exact to the second after a week (checked against Apple network time server). The watch looks good and I can't say I've had a problem with the digital display - if it was brighter I think it would tend to be distracting. The slide rule looks good but I doubt more than 1% of buyers will actually use it. One small negative point I have noticed is that although the hands are luminous the hour markers aren't, which makes things a little tricky in complete darkness - a silly oversight, hence 4 stars. Overall though, well worth the money."
2,Not Happy,I should have paid closer attention to the reviews. The digital display is VERY faint. Backlight isn't much better. The analog and digital displays are not synched. Watch looks great but that's it. Will be sending it back.
5,Mindblowing introduction to mind and matter - do you exist?,"I approached this book with initial scepticism due to its subject matter; quantum physics and mentalism. However, this book is so gracefully written that it guides the reader with relative ease through Einstein's special relativity and seriously questions reality as we know. This book is thought provoking in the utmost - well worth it."
1,The cards STINK!,I bought them from barnes and noble thinking...maybe. I was wrong. Save your twelve dollars and get examkrackers. You can learn more from googling mcat topics than you can studying these cards. Please don't buy these cards. I hope the manufacturer goes bankrupt.
3,Okay for the price,"Although they contain several errors, these cards have a lot of information. They're decent for studying, especially considering their price. However, I recommend making your own if you have the time."
1,Good... if you want to lower your MCAT score,"I should have listened to Paul Mansour's advice. Most of the cards are very general, and sometimes worthless. For example- subject: chemistry. The front of the card says ""CONVERSION FACTOR"". The back of the card says ""A fraction which expresses and equality between 2 units of measurement and can be used to convert from 1 to the other"". No kidding. There are a few decent biolgy and physics cards for definitions and equations, but there are NO cards for organic chemistry. I guess you get what you pay for. But for 9 dollars + shipping, you could go see a movie like 'Next Friday', have popcorn too, and probably benefit just as much in prep for the MCAT as these study cards."
5,Indispensable,"While Spence's ""The Search for Modern China"" may be currently the most popular survey of modern Chinese history, Hsu's work is indispensable for the student of wants a deep understanding of China and the Chinese. I was fortunate enough to have studied the material covered with Hsu at Santa Barbara, while he was working on the first edition and still using the then only good English language Asian history by Fairbank (+ others) as a text. While I still have my copy of Fairbank's two volumes, which remain useful for Japan and Southeast Asia, it is to Hsu's text I still refer on matters of Chinese history."
5,A Great Work,"I needed a book for my university studies on China, and this was by far the best. It is detailed, sharp and well written. I cannot see much bias either way, or if there is the other side is shown.A very good treatment on the subject."
5,double single,it is a very helpful book to study contemporary architects. moneo explains the architects's phylosophy with theorical basis well. this book will be a good text book to understand 8 world class architects' ideas and works regarding architecture.
2,Get the Suspension Version,"Well, this seat was a huge upgrade over the non-padded seat that came with the bike, but after a few miles it felt just as worthless as the stock one. I debated over this seat and the suspension version of it then decided on this one. Two weeks later I ordered the suspension version the difference is night & day. Do yourself a favor and just get the suspension version right off the bat."
3,Appaloosa,"I purchased the book after seeing the movie version expecting to enjoy an expanded story. Well, the movie pretty much followed the book, even down to the dialog, except the language was cleaner in the movie! Some folks have a knack of knowing when and how to cuss; Parker isn't one of them. I doubt men of the Old West were as impolite to prostitutes as the book characters, or that the ""f"" word was prevelant then.I don't recommend the book. Waste of money and you'll have to hide it from the kids.The follow-up title, 'Resolution', is far worse!"
2,High Hopes lead to Disappointment,"I had high hopes for this book, Parker's first Western. However, while Appaloosa has all the elements of a good Western, the novel left me not caring at all about the characters.Parker's lack of knowledge about horses is painfully evident, as when he refers to a ""buckskin with a LIGHT (caps mine) mane"", which is genetically impossible.There are severe editing problems with the text, especially when the Appaloosa stallion appears. ""Appaloosa"" is capitalized in one sentence, then not in the next.I particularly resented the publisher's trick of using large font size and double-spacing to make the reader think they are getting more book for their money than they are. If this book had been printed as most are, it would have come in at well under 200 pages.I was really disappointed in this book. Worse than being a terrible novel, it's just mediocre."
4,? It's Tape ?,It fits my labeler.It does the color scheme as advertised.It's the right width.???It's sticky...What all can you say about tape?
4,"Fine for the price, but definitely not a high quality tool set.","My all-in-one tool quit after first attempt to use it in a real-life application and I was out in the market for pliers. The topmost pliers on this set looked exactly as what I needed: old school classical pair of pliers (in my opinion, the simplest tools are usually the hardest to break). I didn't really need all the other items from the set but still it was nice to have different options for a job. The set arrived in two days, just as expected based on Prime shipping speed. The only complaint I have so far is that the set looked like if it was gently used and then repackaged. So I was not completely sure if it was brand new but since the tools were fully functional I decided to keep it. Used a couple of times and these pliers didn't feel like something easy to break. Good job, Titan."
4,a brief history of the mass-marketing of personal finance,"""A Piece of the Action"" describes the mass-market revolution in personal finance. The story starts with the first credit cards and continues through the development of mutual funds, discount brokerage houses, and money market accounts. Along the way you will meet characters such as Peter Lynch, Dee Hock, and my personal favorite, Andrew Kahr. None of the products these people developed were available prior to 1960.The book offers no tips and it may not help you manage your own personal fianances, but by understanding the history of mass-market personal finance, you may be better prepared for the future."
4,VAMPIRES IN A COMICAL VEIN,"Yes, this is a vampire movie done in a comical vein, (pardon the pun) It is very light-hearted and enjoyable, particularly due to the performance of Keith Szarabajka as "" Dr. David Zuckerman, Hematologist Extraordinaire "", as he introduces himself to the Vampiress whose blood disorder he is studying. Fans of the action TV Series, "" THE EQUALIZER "" will remember Keith Szarabajka as Mickey Kostmayer, the sidekick of Edward Woodward's ""Equalizer""...."
3,Pretty Much your Usual Fellini...,"This film offers visually arresting images, set in an incoherent pastiche. Forget about the linear mode here (as so often with this director).Fellini has a wonderful eye for faces and for grotesqueries. He has a strong sense of the dark and the compelling. These strengths are attended to in his Satyricon.Fellini sometimes tends to work in fragments, without form or guiding direction. Don't look for plot in much of Fellini, and certainly not in his Satyricon. Those of us uncomfortable without straightforward plots will be uncomfortable with the Satyricon.The movie's major strengths lie in the arresting vignettes of a Roman empire coming apart and jaded in its indulgences. There are historical truths hinted at here. But do NOT look for a coherent plot."
3,Could have been a better transfer,"This movie does not need my praises. It's simply a must for its depiction of an exhuberantly ironic if amoral way of living as well as some of the most arresting images ever put on film. It should have received 5 stars. I rated it 3 because it does not appear that the transfer to DVD was from a pristine negative.... there is more detail than the VHS,of course, and it's in Italian, not English-dubbed, but if they are going to reissue a film like this, they could have gone the full mile. I hope that when they get to 8 1/2 they do..... in fact, I hope Criterion and not MGM puts it out."
1,1 star out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An almost unwatchable film with no plot, structure, or continuity of any kind, Fellini-Satyricon is a perfect example of why you shouldn't literally adapt literature that wasn't meant to be filmed (like, oh say, a 2000 year old work of satire whose context has been completely stripped) and expect it to work as a movie."
2,Listen before you buy,Ashley MacIsaac should have stuck with Scotish/Celtic music. I do not recommend this CD to those who enjoyed his previous works.
1,TZ Tape won't stick to anything. Peels right up,"This tape will not stick to anything. It is pure garbage. I had a printer many years ago and didn't have a problem with the tape. Got a new printer about a year ago with a few different tape sizes and they all suck. They will not stick to a cardboard box, a file folder or even a plastic container. So sorry I ever bought this garbage at this point. I've tried a number of times re-printing the label, wiping the surface off and sticking it on again. Not even ten minutes later and it's peeling up again. The labels look fine the print is crisp and sharp, easy to read. I just can't seem to get the tape to adhere to anything I put it on. The tape can be slightly difficult to handle. Peeling off the backs can be a little tricking. I just wish they actually would stick to something. I can't stand TZ tape anymore."
3,"Easy to use, inexpensive, but wastes a lot of tape when cut.","This is a versatile tape. Lots of uses. The problem is when you print, and cut for labeling, it wastes a few inches at a time. Before long, it adds up and converts into money wasted. Why did they design it like that? Maybe, so you buy more tape."
5,Super Yummy!,"This are wonderful""biscuits."" Previously I've only been able to buy them in the Bahamas or Italy. I was thrilled to find a way have them at home! They arrived unbroken in good time. Wahoo!"
1,Great Paper for the price,"I use this paper for proofing, double sided, nice, bright surface for true colors; can't beat it for the price."
5,Everyone that comes to this website should read this!,"After reading this book I was truely enlightened, enlightened by the thought that I have the right to buy and read what I want, when I want. It's fascinating to read this book and read about the different works of literature that were, and in many cases still are, banned throughout the world for either: sexual, social, political, or religious reasons. So if you love literature as much as I do, check this book out it is fascinating."

2,I Know It Is 1986,"I know it is 1986, but the WWF could of done a better job. My favorite match was the Bulldogs Vs Valentine/Beefcake for the Tag Team titles. The production of this ""spectacle"" was poor, but like every WM it has its ups and downs, mostly downs."
4,The King of Hearts,"This is one of the greatest films ever made. It has depth, without being pretentious, with a light, amusing, and touching style. It gently questions without pedantry some of the more dehumanizing aspects of social institutions and false values. It helps restore our faith in human beings without being naive or sanitizing. It offers a wonderful blend of irony, compassion, and deft underlying tragedy with humorous overtones. It has a memorable cast and superb directing and music. However, PLEASE NO LETTER BOX. The 10% or so gain in screen width is more than offset by the loss of the whole movie in terms of clarity and intimacy."
4,Ulan Bator : Cool French rock band,"Ulan Bator : Cool French rock band, I got their CD yesterday Ego:EchoSome of the songs are instrumental, spacey, trippy, like the French Mogway.Others are pop-rock post-grunge and others just old school punk.I was blowm away.Highly recommendable."
2,ho-hum,"This book aims to astonish with its reach but instead is a mish-mash of material that is ultimately mediocre. The author's dabblings in various modes of writing falter so often that the book becomes an ongoing example of the potential pitfalls to be avoided when 'appropriating' a style (the possible self indulgence of New York School writing, the occasionally forced obscurity of langpo, etc.). These poems are not horrible and would make a decent portfolio for a creative writing undergrad or maybe even a grad student who was performing at the bottom of the class, but one can only wonder how this manuscript got published by a major poetry press."
5,"pomo tarot... a fun, hip deck!","I really liked this deck and book. Can be used as a serious reading deck, but it's all postmodern-like! ;> Perfect for readings with cynical, hipster friends."
4,Solid Underground Funk Comp,"This is one of the better widely available funk comps out there. Varied mix of groovers and shakers from the Pacific Northwest - the vibe ranges from soul to 60's/70's pop covers with a funk edge to straight-up funk to some jazz-funk rarities. Almost guaranteed that you won't find any of these songs anywhere else, unless you pick up the original vinyl at a tag sale in Tacoma. The only reason this is a 4 star record is that you can hear some of the original vinyl pops and hisses from the transfer - to pro-tools editing on this one, but it almost enhances the rare groove experience."
1,This regards the Pelican brand S-Video,"I usually don't write reviews, but the Pelican S-Video cable for DC is sooooo bad I needed to share. I was all excited when I got it (Yay, an S-Video cable for the DC) but I was QUICKLY disappointed. First of all the cable is WAY to short, it's probably less than five feet long. Second of all (and this is why it's so bad), the picture quality is TERRIBLE. Theres background static (something that should be almost completely eliminated when dealing with S-Video) and a weird sort of image netting. The colors are good but the weird image is so bad that the only thing this cable has over the ones packaged with the machine is the color quality. Stay away from indefinitly."
5,A Must if you Have S-Video Hookups,"If your TV has S-Video inputs, then most definently get this cable. It separates the color from the brightness/darkness of the video signal, which results in a much clearer picture. I have my Playstation, Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, and DVD player hooked up via this wire."
4,Westkoast Westpresenta'z 4-Sho!!!!!,"This Is A Good Album! The BattleCat Beats Are Bumpin', Which Make Up For The Alright Lyrics That Ganxsta Ridd Spits. The Real Highlight Of The Album Is ""911"" With Eminem & B-Real. Eminem Sets The Standard By Making A Gangsta Beat And Spitting His Usual Unmatched Lyrics But B-Real & Ganxsta Ridd Follow With Power With Their Verses. ""Beautiful Thang"" Is Another Great Song That Hits Home With Them Oldie Beats And Gangbangin' Flows. Baby Downn Outshines Ridd On This Track And Proves To Be A Future Star On The Westcoast. West Up!! Buy The Album And You Won't Be Disappointed!!"
3,big production,"the tribe goes for a very modern hip hop sound here. super slick production. i really hope they will make the big bucks with this album as i think they do deserve it! the bunch of gueststars should help here.for me personally it is disappointing that obviously monsta o didn't play his bass on that album as i rate him a fantastic bassist - saw them life some years ago, he's truly a monster. the production is typical modern hip hop and some of the rawness of the old albums like new funky nation and doomsday got lost. the voices, rapping or singing, are still great and i enjoy seeing eminem or b-real paying well deserved homage to the tribe. this alone justified to buy the album for me...and of course the dvd. don't get me wrong this is not a bad album, far from it...i just don't rate it above their old stuff. long live the tribe!!"
5,Goodnight Opus,"I was quite surprised last night when my 15 and 17 year old daughters came in at midnight to ask me to read to them their favorite childhood bedtime story... Goodnight Opus! They waited until midnight, so it was my youngest's birthday and it was her first b-day request. I hadn't read to them in years and was very touched that something that I had done when they were little (like reading this book everynight) still meant something to them! (""Mom, you have to give the characters the same voices, though!""). Thank you Opus for years of enjoyment!"
4,New Sound,"By now most people that are in the know about music have heard some form of dance punk. However, most people dont realize that the Rapture were one of the first bands to take the beats from the disco bands of the 70s and add the attitude and simplicity of discos rival punk to make some of the most interesting music of the new millenium. get this before echos, it will make you apreciate the rapture so much more."
5,Pure Gold,"Musicoligists agree that the ninth was Beethovens finest symphony, and one of the best symphonys ever written..As if that weren't enough Toscanini is considered one of the greatest conductors.You really can't go wrong with this one...it's a great exxperience"
3,"to Andrew G (New Jersey, USA","I saw an OEM RS-80N3 on ebay for only $15 including shipping.I wonder if that non-Canon works as this $50 Canon remote Switch.Have anyone used both?Thanks,NicK XU"
4,"It does the job, but does it have to be so big?","I have always been a big believer in cable/remote releases. I use a tripod whenever possible and a remote trigger is essential when you want to eliminate any chance of vibrations. I have been experimenting with a technique known as HDR (High Dynamic Range) where you take between 3 and 6 shots of the same scene at different exposure settings (see my humble example under ""Customer images"") and merge them together into one photo. For this, as well as many other situations, a cable release is absolutely necessary.My only complaint (more of a question) is why, in this age of digital circuity, is this thing so big? It could easily be the size of a thumbnail but it is fairly large. Anyway, I am glad that I have it."
2,Not a very good connector,"With any RFU adapter for any system, you lose more than you gain. Everything comes out of one connector pin - video & sound - and the amount of qulaity loss is substantial. The video quality is hampered in that it becomes really, really dim, the colors bleed, and it doesn't have the crispness that hi-res games should have. The audio is in mono and at a low-fidelity. The standard connection is with A/V cables (where video, left & right audio each have their own wire); check to see if your VCR or tv has these, it's much improved over RFU. The BEST possible connection is with S-Video (a video cable where color information and brightness are seperated), but not many smaller tv's have this.If you have to use RFU, then by all means buy this product. Just be aware of the loss of quality."
5,You Can Really Feel With Her,"Wow! This book got me inside Lisa's heart and soul, and showed me what it's like to be an abused woman. Now I understand what they go through. It's a real eye-opener and a very readable book, just like reading somebody's diary. I recommend it highly!"
4,"NEVER TRUST SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE CHILDREN, MUSIC OR ANIMALS","GREAT QUALITY, QUICK SHIPPING, COULDN'T BE ANY BETTER THAN THEY DESCRIBED IT."
4,buy and enrich your techno-house-trance repertoire,"this is quite an old cd now but i find it much better than garniers newer cds. 30 is a good album but for me it lacks some good big fast beats, unreasonable behaviour is really strange: what i call experimental techno-drum&bass (have a listen to it and decide). as a fan of anything danceable (french touch, progressive, trance, funk-disco, dance, electro, house-hardhouse) i promise you won't dislike this album!"
5,Excellent flute CD - the best I have ever heard,"I have kept this CD in my changer for the past two months. This is simply the best flute CD I have heard - I realized the true beauty of the instrument. In short, it is a ""Must Have"" for any music lover."
5,Canon Metal Neck Strap,"Excellent product. Highly recommend!Canon Metal Neck Strap 1 for All Elph Cameras, 34"" Length"
4,Great look,"I love love love this item and the customer service as well as shipping was great!!!! I gave it 4 stars because my dog chewed it up the same day we put it on. It looked AMAZING, but was not durable enough for our Akita :-("
4,Very Cute.,"So I was debating about getting this or not, because it is a little pricy for a dog tag. But ultimately I decided to do it, and I am very happy with my decision. Like other reviewers, the seller contacted me on email and allowed me to give all our information that way. On top of that, they printed it in German for me! Ultimate customization. And it was here within a week of ordering! My dog's little photo is so adorable and I can't wait to walk him down the streets in our new home. I hope it holds up over the next couple years. Will be back with an update.***Update***It has been over a year and the tag is still in tact. I'm very happy with my purchase. The only reason why it isn't 5 stars is because it's on the pricey side.Even so, I think I will order a new tag with our current address."
3,Business Lacks Quality Product,"Although the business claims that you may email in your information to make the process quicker...it still took about 6 weeks to get the product. The ""item"" that is first shipped to you is the information card that you are supposed to fill out and send back before they can send you your purchase. When we FINALLY received the product, it appears cheaply made. The supplied key ring broke the first day and the paint started peeling off the tag after about the third day. I will definitely search elsewhere for the next tag. Although it is cute, the end product from this business is definitely not worth the wait. If it was more professionally done, it would be worth the wait."
1,Disappointing and limited,Rita says at the beginning that she is a person who makes excuses for herself and for others. You get that in this book. I admit I quit reading while she was in Guatamala but I was so frustrated. There are so many possibilities for her self that she stiffles. I had been looking forward to this book.
4,A few flaws but happy to have read it,"Although too invested in convincing us of her saintliness and unceasingly self-congratulatory, nonetheless a good read for her insider/outsider perspective. Her descriptions of Balinese funeral, gift giving, and hygiene practices was especially interesting."
5,Rainy weekend reading,"I was lucky to have had this book recommended to me ... I bought Rita's book and was off for many exotic adventures, new friends, struggling through up hill climbing, (both physical and emtional)l and lots of inspiration.Best book of the Millineum!"
3,Hungry for Ho Mok,"""I will make myself alert once more to the kinds of chance encounters that are always out there. I turned them off when I began writing; soon I will pay attention to them again and see where they lead me.""Rita Gelman's experiences while following the path of chance encounters are amazing and should serve as an example to those of us stuck in routine. Every roadblock seemingly presented a chance for a new friend and a new adventure. In her small way, she is tying threads amoung the peoples of the world.I found the book interesting and inspiring, but I thought it started dragging about 2/3 of the way through. Maybe I was just itching to hit the road myself. I do want to try Ho Mok, Rita's description of this Thai dish makes it sound delicious."
4,Buy this book-read it over and over,"This is one woman's amazing story of turning heart ache and mid-life crisis into emotional healing, friendship, travel and adventure.Rita does what every woman desires-to go outside of her own borders and experience many other cultures. She learns spanish, indonesian, and experiences so many cultures (to name a few: mexico, bali, nicaragua, galapagos, australia and israel).She can tell a story and she tells it well. At times it's a little slow, but when you look at the tale as a whole-it's really worth it.It's self empowering. You as a woman can go, travel by yourself and live in different countries and cultures you never even imagined existed."
5,Tales of a Female Nomad,I loved this book about a women's search for peace in her life. Rita Golden Gelman had courage to face her fears and is having a wonderful life by being an A Nomad women fitting in every where she goes. My oldest daughter sent me this book after meeting her in Cheyenne Wyoming and feel I would enjoy her writing as we are very much alike in the believe in must live at large in the world. I loved it so much I purchase three others just like it and sent to family and friends who also loved her book. I can't wait to see what she writes about Africa and her adventures. This woman can tell a story that will be passed on between Mother's and children all over the world.
5,Good experience,Item is as described. My exchange student from Japan likes having a reminder of home. Received promptly and at a good price.
2,Too self indulgent,"This is a great example of how bad cds can be for a band. Just think: if this had been vinyl, they would have only 35-40 minutes rather than this 70+ minute mess.Wow, good band but this one needed editing."
4,58mm Lens Hood,Bought for my Canon SX20 iS which had to be converted to 58mm for adding accessories. Needed an adapter ringThe lens hood is very good and screws into the adapter or any 58mm filters. As good quality as the Canon and fits better because of more threads to screw into. The original Canon Lens hood goes on with a 1/4 turn only. Got it here on Amazon.
4,Back to the Mafia,All right. Pendleton is finally taking the Executioner back to the thing that made him famous. The War Against the Mafia. I've been reading Mack Bolan for going on 15 years now. Read 'em all. But it is his fights with the mafia that always seem to be the most enjoyable. And it has been a while since Bolan has been sent after the Mafia like in this book. I recommend this one for any Executioner fan.
3,Locker Shelf,The shelf is truly for a locker. I should have thought. I was hoping to use it in a the kitchen with only 2 sides supporting and it really would like the 3rd side to help support it.But it is very good as a locker shelf.
2,Solid Collection,"Like another Madacy collection in their Ultimate 16 series, this CD has one song listed that is not on the compilation. It lists Yes, ""I'm Ready"" by Teri DeSario and KC, but ""Still"" by Lional Ritchie is track #9. Otherwise, this CD would have rated 3 stars for average. This is a good CD for the price. It's amazing that sloppy work like this would be produced by a major company."
5,Monte Walsh,"Tremendous account of the closing days of the cowboy. The movie depicts the struggles the cowboys faced as modern technology began replacing them. The grittiness of Lee Marvin always makes a great western figure, and yet here we see a glilmpse of his softer side. All the casting was ell done.I think this version is many times better than the more recent redo with Tom Selleck."
2,Only for absolute beginners,"I was disappointed with this set, purchasing after reading other reviews. It was very simplistic, containing very little spanish and was very boring. It didn't hold the attention of my 3 and 5 year olds. Too much english , not enough spanish and dull songs. Avoid, much better spanish introductory tapes available for children."
2,Horrible,"This cable was a piece of crap, first of all it didn't even come in a box, second the wires are VERY thin on this thing, I thought that I was going to break them just by plugging it in, other then that it doesn't work all the time, like the device can't decide which video to go out of so I just get nothing but audio. Don't buy this...."
1,S-Video doesn't work,"The S-Video part of this cable is worthless, like others have stated, just a black and white picture. If you were looking to get a replacement for your composite cables, this would work as the composite works fine, but I assume most people bought this for the S-Video function."
5,Great book.,"A little ""wordy"" but still a great book. Very helpful if your daily life feels chaotic and some semblance of order is sought. Very pleased with this book by Chuck Pierce."
5,Excellent service,Excellent service. Delivery date was in the time frame stated. Would order from this seller again.
2,"Not what I expected for one of the ""Greats""","I am rather disheartened by this recording. I have not knowingly heard many of Toscanini's recordings, but I am well aware of all the hype that surrounds his legacy. I'm hoping this recording was made on an ""off"" day (actually, two off days) for Toscanini. The ensemble is rather raw and unpolished; individual techniques seem to be top-notch (with the exception of the principal bassoon and principal clarinet), but the ensemble as a whole is rather lacking in clarity and accuracy. Intonation seems to be an issue also--again, with the principal bassoon.Also, the style seems to be rather ambiguous. I don't get the full ""programatic"" effect that's present in the Beethoven's writing in the 6th symphony."
5,LaBonne Cuisine,"Not only does it have recipes, but it goes into very basic cooking, what utensils are needed and why, and how and why to do various things while cooking. I am a novice at cooking but found this book to be very helpful and interesting!"
4,Probiotic Supplement,I do believe probiotic supplements are a must. This keeps your system flowing and helps with bloating after eating certain foods. It is great for people that suffer from irritable bowel syndrome. So great for the immune system. I think everyone should take some type of probiotic. Works for me
1,Have seen no benefits from this at all,"After reviewing this product on Amazon I was expecting to see maybe some increased energy, or help with my acid reflux which causes bad breath, or something. I have seen no changes in anything at all and I have been on it for over 2 weeks. Not sure how long I am supposed to take it before I see a difference, I just thought I would have noticed something by now."
2,What happened?,"I originally bought this product on December 11, 2011 for $21.38. Was thrilled with the product and it gave me great relief from my irritable bowel problems. I told my doctor about it and how much better it made me feel. Now I am getting low on the pills and want to place another order.....but the price has risen to $84.00--thats a 400% increase!! What the heck? I cannot afford that much of an increase, therefore I give it 2 stars because for the cost increase. Very disappointed."
2,"Well its a nice New Age Christmas Album, but where's the Shire????","Obvious that the makers of this disc wanted to get some of the Lord of the Rings publicity. Yep, they suckered me alright. I was expecting something relating it to Tolkiens work.Nope. Just a New Age Christmas album, like there isn't enough of them out there already."
5,simple and usable keyboard,"The best thing about this keyboard is it's standard layout --- I really do like that all the function keys (F1, ... F12) are grouped in quadruples, so that I don't confuse them --- the feature I miss the most in all newly-designed keyboards.This keyboard also looks simple yet stylish, and I find it to be pretty comfy."
2,ZZZZZZ........,"I like books of this sort but sorry, the author couldn't keep me awake. This is one of the more boring books I've ever attempted to read."
5,An excellent book that will serve many readers,"This is an excellent book, not only for tourists and visitors to the Monterey Peninsula, but also for those considering relocating there (like me). I wanted a book about the region that describes the neighborhoods and towns in order to get a general feel for the area (information pertinent to those contemplating a move), and this book does just that. It is amazing how much information the authors have managed to jam into each page, and they have included a good deal of local history. The book is written in a witty, engaging, almost conversational style. Unlike many books of this genre, the blurbs about restaurants, inns, and everything else are written descriptively, rather than subjectively or from the authors' personal points of view (which may differ from the reader). In short, this is a very well-written book from two people who clearly love the peninsula on which they live!"
3,Avrage Anime,"Street Fighter has earned a great reputation in all its games and anime over the year, and this series is no exception.The reason i gave it only 3 stars, is the flow of events doesnt really pick up til about the fifth episode. They used some very cheezy music and made the series seem almost childish.But dont get me wrong, when the series picked up, it was well worth the money, and by the last episode, i immidately wanted to go out and buy the next dvd.Give this series a shot and wait it out, you wont be disapointed"
1,Belkin Expresscard Docking Station,"Save your money. Was hoping this would be a good way to swap peripherals between three identical laptops we use in the house. The install went fine, but every computer would bluescreen as soon as it was plugged in."
3,It Works,"Although I did see a lot of negative feedback posted for this product, I thought I'd give it a shot anyway since it really seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. Setting up the product was a sinch. The directions were very straight forward and everything installed and worked as expected. I had plugged into the unit a monitor, speakers, ethernet, and a couple of additional USB devices. Again, everything worked just fine. What disappointed me was the video quality, it was very poor. I had the docking station hooked up to my Alienware M15x laptop. As you may or may not know, this is a gaming system with fantastic graphics. When running the monitor through the docking station, the graphics were well below average so this didn't fly with me. Otherwise, everything else was fine.If you're not worried about video quality, then I'd recommend you give it a try."
3,Ghost Hunters Season 6 Pt 2,The star rating doesn't reflect the show at all. It reflects the damn DVD's. After selecting a couple different vendors and having no success we have concluded Season 6 Part 2 is defective. I'd appreciate Amazon or someone please help we want our collection.
2,Works well enough but not designed with comfort in mind.,"I have no complaints about the functionality of the controller. As a game control, it works great. However it's not comfortable to hold. It is bulky and awkward."
2,"OK for some games, terrible for others","I am very disappointed with the design and quality of all of the Dreamcast controllers currently available in the U.S. The Quantum Fighter Pad is no exception. It feels more comfortable in my hands than the standard Sega Dreamcast controller and is made of softer plastic in spots, but it is quite a bit bigger. The shoulder buttons are too big and thick for rapid presses, although the standard buttons feel right. The D-pad is decent once you get used to it, but the analog stick feels flimsy. For Capcom's 2D fighting games, this controller is not acceptable. Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 plays fairly well with this controller (because of the simplized controls), although it's still only a temporary solution for me. By the way, don't let the six buttons on the pad fool you, the Z and C button's functions can't be changed (they always assume the same funtion as the X and A buttons and can't be programmed otherwise). My final recommendation: Try before you buy."
3,Better than much of what I've come across so far.,"Bethany Teachman et al., Helping Your Child Overcome an Eating Disorder (New Harbinger Publications, 2003)I like the way this book is laid out; a good portion of it is in workbook form, for you to write down answers to the questions the authors ask you as they go along. It's also relatively easy reading, and clearly written.As with, seemingly, most books on the subject of childhood and teen eating disorders, the authors tend to focus more on anorexia and bulimia than binge eating disorder, but not to the extent of some of the books I've either read or skimmed on the subject. And the authors do address the subject more in depth than a number of books.Useful. ***"
2,No odor control,"Unfortunately, this litter failed in one key area: odor control. After adding 40lb of this to a clean litterbox, the odor was so bad after only one day that I couldn't believe it. This is really too bad because this litter has many other great features, such as very low dust, larger pieces that clump very tightly and low tracking. I only wish it had any ability to control the litterbox odor. There seemed to be almost no odor neutralization, which I notice immediately since I'm in a small apartment and the litterbox is in my bedroom. If you are using this for a litterbox in a utility room or basement, perhaps the odor wouldn't be such a problem, but this is definitely not for tight living spaces. Especially for the price, this is a disappointing litter."
5,Quality litter,"I purchased precious cat low dust litter,when my cat developed a breathing problem. I was really pleased with this product. I will continue to use it, the litter is a good quality and it's the best I've used."
2,grundig e traveller,"Initially was a fine small worldband, light, accurate, strong in pulling in stations. After a fairly short time, the volume control knob started to stray, sound faded in & out. The printing on the buttons,especially the hours/minutes, have disappeared - worn off. Battery life is quite good. Now consider this product as unreliable since audio reception is chancy."
2,Wrong CD Title on Amazon,"Amazon had the wrong CD title as ""Peace On Earth"" on the web page. The title shown on the photo of the CD is ""Christmas Peace"". The title on the web page should have been ""Christmas Peace"" by Moscow Boys Choir. I ordered this CD from two different sellers hoping to get the correct one, but each time receiving the wrong one. Both sellers credited my account with both cost and shipping and handling. I emailed Amazon about the erroneous title for this CD and they immediately corrected it. As for the CD I received, it was ""From Russia With Love"" which I already had. ""From Russia With Love"" is a fantastic CD with many different performers including some by the Moscow Boys Choir. I would highly recommend this CD if you enjoy incredibly beautiful choral music."
4,Very good lens,"Very good lens. Not the best one Canon offers but does exactly what I needed.I considered buying Canons 24mm 1.4 L for about a year but could not justify the price. I could buy three of these for the price of the 24mm.All i wanted was a good low light, fast, lens to take candid shots with out the crappy flash on the camera.The images are great. Actually converts to about a 44mm film lens on my DSLR.No regrets."
5,A Great CD !!,"This is a Great CD. I am not much into rap but when I heard this CD I just had to have one. Every song on this CD is great!! If I had to pick my faverite I guess I would say ""Mexican Soldiers"" and ""Make that Money"".Buy this CD it is well worth it!!"
5,great product,I have no idea why I slept on an air mattress for so long? This by far is one of the best products out there. Plus since I don't have that much room to use for a bed it fits perfectly.
5,just as described.,This is a great product. use it alot with sleepovers for my daughters friends. we like it alot.
5,Great Cots,"We purchased these cots for our camping trip. We were tried of sleeping on a queen air mattress that would deflate by the next morning. I purchased them and Amazon shipped them quickly. To them camping, assembled them quickly without reading the instruction manual, and had the best night sleeping. They were comfortable and long enough that our toes were not falling off the end. Great cots....I would recommend to everyone."
4,Love these!,"I don't know why I never thought of using cots all these years.They are easy, lightweight and fit tall people.We love these. No more leaky or soft airbeds and you can place stuff under them. My kids take them to their friends houses when they spend the night now too.One of my 4 did rip this summer and I only got them in May.But I got an amazing deal on them using my AmEx wishlist discount, so Im happy. ( they ran me about 12 bucks each) Would be 5 stars if it didn't rip."
3,Leonard Maltin is wrong!,"What is wrong with him? The movie's not that bad. The last segment, Municipalians, is confusing sometimes, but it's also pretty funny. Fred Willard, Robby Benson, Robert Culp, and Barry Diamond are all awesome!! Besides, you get to see Ann Dusenberry naked, and that's almost worth the price right there. The first two segments are very good. Any fan of the National Lampoon should enjoy this."
3,Theyre no Devils,"Dead Low Tide has everything you would want from Spencer Moody, but the Murder City Devils band sound is gone. Its all the conviction and intensity that they used to have, minus the unique sound (no keyboards really).Its a little angrier and a little heavier.If you havent heard of the Murder City Devils, maybe this wont be disappointing."
2,Compatible Brand Toner Woes,"My purchase experience was very good with regard to the seller and delivery. I've bought two of these compatible toner cartridges and find them to be substandard. The first one had a defective drum shutter that caused frequent paper jams. Any curling of the leading edge of the sheet prevented the sheet from going over the drum as it should. Print quality was excellent when it printed. Duplex printing was impossible. The second cartridge prints with a thin solid vertical black line on the right edge of each sheet. The bargain cartridges may be OK for drafts or other non important work, but anyone looking for trouble free printing should buy the genuine HP replacement."
3,Quality of the 24-70mm f/2.8 vs Quality of 70-200mm f/2.8,"Although the Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 ""L"" lens does a good job, it does not compare with the clarity, contrast, or the color saturation that I can get with the Canon 70-200mm IS f/2.8 ""L"" lens. The Bokeh of the 70mm-200mm is much more pleasing then the 24-70mm Canon lens and that may be due to the different focal lengths. I don't know if I have an execeptional 70-200mm or that I have a 24-70mm that is below normal standards for the lens."
5,Awe-inspiring!,"I don't know where to begin. I use this lens with the Canon EOS 20D and a B+W 77mm Multi-Coated UV Haze filter (a STRONG recommendation: don't degrade a lens like this with cheap glass in front of it). The color and clarity that come from this lens will put a sparkle in your eye. If you can afford it, buy this lens and you'll feel like a National Geographic photojournalist every day."
2,Disappointing at best,"I just received this lens today and of course did some controlled comparative shooting against my other Canon L lenses and a 24-60 sigma. My control tests were with and without a flash on a tripod and wireless shutter release.I find the images very soft on the ends. From 4.0 to 20, photos were acceptable but not stunning. 5.6 seemed to give the sharpest picture which I find strange.Needless to say, this will be back in the mail tomorrow and just not in the mood to play swap and shop and praying for a descent copy. I can pull any sigma or any other brand off the shelf and get much better results at 1/4 the cost.I rated this 2 stars for excellent color and contrast, although this deserves 1 star.$1000 for this junk? C'mon canon, get real."
5,Absolutely Essential,This lens is Canon's workhorse and can be used to produce stunning portraits in low light situations and marvelous landscape shots on a Full Frame sensor. Have not had a single issue with this lens. Highly Recommended!
5,Canon's Number 1 Lens,"This is simply the number one must own lens for any Canon EOS owner. It's the lens you will use the most, it's performance is flawless, it's built like a tank and it's beautiful glass to look at. If you have EOS and are serious at all about photography - this should be the first lens you own."
5,Professional Item,"What a lense!! I bought it to basically replace the 18-55mm lense that came with my EOS 20D. I was a little concerned about the price, but what an item. It's superb. I know that a good lense doesn't make a good photo, but with this lense the picts I do take just seem so much clearer. I'm stunned at how good it is.The only slight con about the lense is it's weight. But, that should not stop you buying."
2,Poor auto focus compared to 24-105 f/4L IS,"I have tried two samples of this lens, and they both behave the same: severe back focus. Worse, when I try to compensate using the focus microadjustment feature of my camera (Canon 7D), the focus jumps around +/- several inches from shot to shot (measured at 70mm focal length and 6' subject distance). In practice, I sometimes got lucky and was rewarded with a very sharp image, but most of the time the images were soft to very soft. In contrast, the auto focus on the 24-105mm f/4L IS is extremely repeatable (I needed a +4 microadjustment on my 7D), resulting in sharp image after sharp image. Plus, the 24-105 is lighter, smaller, cheaper, and has an extra 35mm of reach. Yes, the f/4 is one stop slower, but it also has 4 stops of IS, which works very well. Low light motion situations are the only place where the extra f-stop of the f/2.8 would be an advantage, but your photos will still be soft."
3,HIgh Price by Third party Websites!!! watch out!!!,"The Canon Manufacturer website shows the price as $1399.00 I'm surprised to see that the third party sellers are price gouging the lenses for no reason. Usually all retail sellers get at a price marked below the MSRP. So, Most of them would sell at a lesser price than displayed at the Manufacturer website. I'm baffled by Amazon.com supporting these Retailers and asking for a huge Marked up price!!!"
4,Sunzi Speaks well....,"This particular translation of Sunzi's work, while simplified, is one of the better ones. It is a good book to peruse as a stand-alone or alternately a companion to a more complex version. True, the simplification can be a trifle distracting at times, but the amusing drawings and casual language capture the attention of the reader more than the dry translations that are the norm, keeping the focus on the intent behind the prose.Should one be looking for a scholarly piece for scholarly work, it is likely that this would not be the correct book to use. For reading pleasure and comprehension, though, this particular work cannot be beaten. To dismiss it as suitable only for children or semi-literates smacks of elitism and narrow-mindedness."
5,Fantastic,Hilarious...As an Irishman living abroad I could see the little towns and pubs so clearly. The characters were so obviously real
5,Simply Charming,"There is something to be said for a man who keeps his promises and follows through on his bets. There is much more to be said for Tony Hawks, for whom following through on a bet means traveling around Ireland with a fridge. The quote on the cover of the book warns no read the book alone in a public place because it is far too funny. I found that reading this book in my home brought questions of my sanity from those I lived with because I couldn't stop laughing. Hawks tells a story that is funny, philosophical and, yes, even heartwarming. The stories that unwind as Hawks travels range from strange to funny and are a great picture of a man on an adventure and the warmth of a country."
4,A delightful and humorous read,Tony Hanks is a parttime standup comic and it shows in this humorous book which has as its premise a drunken bet to hitchhike around Ireland with a fridge. Hanks makes it with the help of a radio disc jockey (Ireland has a national radio station.)It must be fun to live in Ireland as apparently most evenings are spent in a pub drinking and singing. Hanks ends up in a pub most evenings. I rate this book slightly below Bryson's a Walk in the Woods and Helen Fields Bridget Jones Diary in terms of laughter intensity.
3,"Funny, a little self-indulging, but overall a good message!",A funny biographical account of one man's travel's through the beauty and kindness of Ireland. The overall message of spreading joy (unconventially with a fridge) is a good one that should be shared to all.
2,Doesn't seem to work on flies,"This is nicely built, well designed unit but it didn't actually work for me. It lured and killed a few small moths and such but the flies completely ignored it.I can't recommend this, especially for the price. Flypaper is much cheaper."
4,Elmore Leonard at his finest..,"In Elmore Leonard novels one expects memorable characters, terrific dialogue, and a plot with incomprehensible twists and turns. 'Rum Punch' delivers all this. For the most part this story about drug dealers, gun smugglers, and a savvy flight attendant is a great read. I am always amazed how Leonard seemingly catches every nuance of deadbeats and thugs yet makes their actions comical. The only flaw with 'Rum Punch' reflects the author's tendency to make his plot endings too clever and overly contrived. Yet on the whole this is misdemeanor, not a felony.Bottom line: a great introduction into the world of Elmore Leonard. Recommended for all."
2,The price is right.,"I am not sure why this compilation garnered such high scores so far. Maybe because I am into a different brand of dnb, but the tracks on this CD are among the least musical pieces of noise I have heard, with rare exceptions. The beats are rather cliche dnb, which in itself is not too bad. The deep sub-basslines sound great production-wise, but the patterns are often nonsensical.Generally, if you like very repetitive hard and fast dnb with powerful bass and sinister yet musically simplistic soundscapes, then by all means, get this cd. However, if you expect something fresh, clever, or something that has at least a little bit of musical value, look elsewhere. This is not Roni Size, Aphrodite, or Pendulum. This is dumbed-down Dieselboy."
4,"Helpful information, easy to read.","I expected another book trying to be funny, but I found myself learning how to get through the process smoothly. I bought two more copies for friends when they got engaged."
1,easist way to guit smoking by karr,"need this on kindle can not read book not large enough. lossing eye sight need larger font, heard it was a good book but van not read it if its not on kindle"
5,buy it!,"If you want to quit, buy this book now. It works. Take it from a hard drinker of 20 years. It works. Get it, turn off the TV and read it."
3,"If you have the 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L lens, read this first","I purchased the 1.4 extender to increase the range of my Canon 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L USM IS lens. I checked the Canon website to ensure compatibility and read the reviews regarding image quality before purchasing. What I missed was that the extender increases the lens to an f/8 which exceeds the aperture opening auto focus requirement of my Canon 40D. Therefore, to use the 1.4 extender, you must rely on manual focus with the 100-400mm lens. There are a number of websites out there which discuss how to tape the contacts of the extender to allow the autofocus to work. The results of the modification are mixed with some people claiming that the performance of the lens can be affected.The loss of autofocus may be an acceptable compromise when compared to the cost of purchasing the longer Canon lenses. However, it is something to be aware of before purchasing the 1.4 extender for the 100-400mm lens."
1,Disappointed,I bought this extension and used a few times. The sharpness is outstanding. The thing that I can't stand is how poorly it was put together. It rattled after a couple of times I used it. The other day I want to use it and the autofocus stopped working altogether. I took it out and one of the small ring fell off from the extension... very disappointed
4,Get even closer,I use this extender with a 100-400 telephoto in good light when I need a bit more reach... My camera is a 50D and I lose auto focus which I miss but it is still of value... You lose one stop so you need to be careful at dawn or dusk to get enough light. Be aware of its limitations but a good value
5,Canon Extender,"This extender is very good, when attached to my 70-200 the results were sharper with it!Well worth the money."
4,Very nice Bible,"I received this Bible when I was raised. It is a very nice gift Bible, and does have sections in it dealing with Masonic ties to the Bible. That said, it is a King James version, and is not really a ""study"" Bible, so if you take it to Bible study you may find you are in the minority as most folks seem to not use the KJ version anymore. I DO wish it had more ""study aides"" in it, such as red-letter, footnotes, illustrations, etc. But that aside, I like it."
5,mmm mmm good!!!!!!,Having recently been in Halifax - i found that this book was right on! Wonderful examples of great food with some history thrown in to boot. Great gift for those who like seafood and want more than just a good receipe.
5,Pretty happy for a first time brewers yeast user.,"So far, I don't mind the taste. I don't like it in plain water (these are flakes, not dissolvable powder). It goes fine in my smoothies and I also like it on toast with butter and honey. Or butter and garlic. Sprinkle it on everything from roasted broccoli to popcorn.I had read that ""debittered"" is not as nutritional as bitter. But when I compared the cans in the store, this scored the same or higher on some of the b vitamins. It might also have something to do with the fact that it is made from beet molasses as opposed to beer."
3,"Helmet Liner, one size doesn't quite fit all","Overall the liner is a plus for me on under-50-degree days. It's warm, and is heavy enough I can have my glasses on under it while putting on my helmet. (With a thin helmet liner my glasses get knocked akilter when putting on the helmet, so I have to take them off and then thread them onto my ears once the helmet is on.)I do wish it had come in sizes rather than the ubiquitous one-size-fits-all, as it's quite tight on my sized 7-5/8 in head. If it was just a little bit bigger I would have rated it 5 stars. But nevertheless, I use it!"
5,Warm helmet liner,"I am in Afghanistan and I wear this under my helmet during the cold winter. It's not bulky or too thick that I have to adjust my chin strap, but it keeps my ears and head very warm. It also fits comfortably on my head, but it may be too tight for someone with a larger head (than a females)."
3,I tested it against the 28-135 mm USM IS lens and . . . . .,"A friend photographer for a local newspaper showed up with one of these, brand new! I tested it against the 28-40 range and the pictures were completely identical in every way, sharpness in every corner, contrast, etc.Just thought I let you know."
2,It's going back!,I orderd this lens a few days ago and I am not keeping it. Here is my reviewPros:* Solid build quality* Fast and quiet autofocus* Well controlled Barrel Distortion even at 17mm.Cons:* After testing this lens for 2 hours. 95% of the pictures were comming out dark with some indoor pictures having dark corners even with my flash on. Picture taken at 2pm on a bright sunny day were dark and colors were dull!!!*My other L lens EF 70-200 f 4 (from 4 years ago) takes amazing picture compared to this one.ConclusionI think this is quality assurance issue. We are in bad economical times and Canon is getting cheap.Now I have to spend $20 to send it back...I am thinking that I am much better off walking into a store and paying the extra bucks and test the lens before buying it...or get a used one from 4 to 5 years ago. In otherwords treat any lens produced in the last 2 years like a Sigma lens test it before you buy it
2,After my 3rd copy I'm still not happy,"I borrowed a friends 17-40 and fell in love. Great color and wonderfully sharp. So I bought one for myself. It was no where near as sharp, it went back, the second was even worse, so blurry my landscapes looked like they were taken with a P&S, even on a tripod at f/11. This third lens is about the same as the second but won't focus right. Sadly I don't think I'll ever get a good copy of this lens."
3,Good but not great...,I decided to return this to pick up a 50mm 1.4 and a 20mm 2.8... sweeping the range is nice but I found myself wanting to tighten depth of field more... this lens just didn't work for me. I eventually do want the 16-35mm 2.8 L lens but it's a bit out of my price range right now.
3,Great for a quick tutorial,"This book is fine for the casual user of Crystal Reports. It has good examples and directs the reader firsthand through some of the really tough topics, like drilldown and cross-tab reporting. While it is an excellent introductory book for the novice, I really can't recommend the book for a more professional user. The book lacks the depth of content required for such a complex tool as Crystal. The book for that is Peck's ""The Complete Guide to Crystal Reports 8"". The thing this book really lacks for the casual user is possibly a section on conversion of earlier versions of CR to version 8. Otherwise, it is an outstanding way to dive right in to report building the Crystal Reports way."
1,BAD,"BAD, VERY BAD...I PICKED THIS BOOK UP FROM A SECOND HAND BOOK SALE.THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE INTERESTING READING... BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.THE FACT WERE SO OUTDATED.NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL."
4,A gardener denied his garden,"A bleak and forbidding tale about a physically disfigured man living in South Africa during a (fictional) civil war. Michael K is an outcast, yet there are some ways in which Coetzee portrays him as a Christ figure.The absence of a human father figure, the sketchy childhood prior to the events of the novel by which time he is 30, the period in the wilderness, his return signalling the drawing of (admittedly only one) disciple to him. Ultimately K is an outsider who wants to be left alone. However, society's paranoia makes it impossible for that to happen and he is condemned to live in circumstances that would kill anyone else. A sad and challenging book, worthy of the accolades accorded it."
5,Haunting tale of the essence of South Africans,"Having read all the reviews on this novel, I have one thing to add.I was born and raised and spent most of my life in the very places described in this novel. It is a perceptive, haunting ""what if"" account and captures the essence of the places and people. I have known so many people like the characters in this book -- and the underlying psyche of the people and places is so authentic, I still think of the images months later in the strangest, most mundane periods of my day to day life.I loved it."
3,An indifferent outcast,"Michael K is a stranger in a world of continuing war.But he is not an interested, and interesting, character. He doesn't fully understand what is happening around him and he doesn't ask fundamental questions about it.He only tries to escape a violent world in order to live peacefully on a small piece of land, alone.If everybody adopts that kind of attitude, mankind is condemned.The author says it himself: 'It is time that he awakens', but K continues to want to live an outcast's life.After Dino Buzzati and others, this is a new version of Franz Kafka's K, but it falls way behind the original masterly 'Trial' of Joseph K."
2,What's the point?,"I didn't like this book and I do not see the point of it. Near the end, the main character, Michael K, questions whether the moral of the story is that there is time for everything. But if that is the moral of this story, then it wasn't clear at all. Michael K has nothing but time, but he doesn't do anything. He seems incapable of doing anything. He cannot cope with living in any kind of society; nor does he succeed in living on his own in the wilderness.Read literally, the book is horribly depressing, because Michael seems to be mentally ill or mentally deficient (because he cannot provide for himself and he has no will to survive; he only knows that he doesn't want to live imprisoned), but no one is able to help him. Read symbolically, I just don't get it. If Michael is supposed to represent some greater meaning, as the doctor/narrator suggests in the second part of the book, what is that meaning? The book doesn't answer that question."
5,Awesome Product,"I love Murad products. This is my go to moisturizer...I love the way it smells, feels and it goes on like silk. There is a tiny shimmer to it too, if you like that kind of thing. I use many Murad products and I have many faves, this is one of them!"
1,wrong size,on the size chart size 39.5 corresponds to size 8.5. On the shoe 39.7 is size 7 so the shoes are too small. They were given as a gift and now they are sitting in the closet
5,Essential reading for compression-heads,"If you're looking for a book that explains how to implement the latest and greatest variation of algorithm X, this isn't the book for you. If you want to understand at a fundamental level *why* compression works, you want to read this.The book has just the right mix of information theory and application. Everything you need to know to understand compression is here; all the rest is in the details."
1,IDIOTIC!!!!,"I have to agree with my fellow readers. This author is misinformed and clueless. First of all, there has never been a Border Guard position in the U.S. There are Border Patrol Agents, but they never work static positions at ports of entry. Secondly, I agree with the fellow reviewer above, anyone with elementary knowledge and border experience could have written this. Don't be swayed by the reviews of, ""former smugglers"" (why do you think they're ""former"" smugglers anyway if it's sooo easy????), AND DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
3,More a vocabulary test,"This little book is not a bad way to practice some vocabulary, but as crossword puzzle it is marginal. Yes, the words are laid out on the page in crossword style, but most words have only one or two letters that overlap with another word, so if you don't know the right word immediately you don't get much in the way of clues."
4,Becoming your own person,"Barbara Stanwyck was one of the best actresses of the 1930's and 40's. My Reputation was made in the 1940's when she was at her zenith, she's beautiful and oh-so-confident. In the movie she plays a woman, newly widowed, living with her two young sons and looking forward to a long, lonely, dull life, and a mother that nags. She goes on vacation with friends and meets a man that looks at life differently. They like each other. She goes home, and she runs into him again, and love happens. But, he doesn't want to get married and she's being pressured by her upper-class friends to give him up and come have more fun, single, with us. Of course, her mother and two young sons put on pressure as well. The ending is exactly as it should be. You will not be disappointed."
1,"One of the worst ""Fidelios"" ever","Toscanini was a great conductor and a great Beethoven interpreter, but everything works against this ""Fidelio."" For one thing, this was a period when he was conducting everything much too fast. For another, he omits all the spoken dialogue which compresses the opera even further. The cast is also dreadful, with almost every singer miscast: Bampton's Leonore is thin and shrill, Peerce's Florestan relentlessly loud and beefy-sounding, Steber's Marzelline too heavy. In addition, neither Bampton nor Peerce sing with any feeling or dramatic conviction. And then there are the Studio 8-H sonics, so dry and boxy that every note sounds like a thump on the head.Try to find the legendary 1941 Met broadcast conducted by Bruno Walter, with Kirsten Flagstad, Rene Maison, Marita Farell and Alexander Kipnis. That is the ""Fidelio"" of the century!"
3,Shorter life cycle,"Works okay - water tastes better, but as other reviewers mentioned, does not seem to last as long. Currently looking to find another filtering system, but will continue to use Pur until we decide on another system."
5,OUR water filter cartridges,Excellent quality at very good price. I have purchased these replacements before and have found them to be very good.
4,Pur 3 Stage Filter,My Pur 3 Stage Filters purchased through Amazon.com were an incredible value when compared to the Department Store purchase of the same product.
5,Best Filters,This is one of the very best filter systems - and a great price for the filter refills. Great service from Amazon too!
2,Product lifetime way overstated,"Very, very expensive product, and advertised in a misleading way. Each of these filters lasts only 2 weeks. Daily use I get out of it = cooking one meal, 6 cups of coffee, 64 oz. drinking water, a tiny cat bowl, and 2 gallons of drink mix per week. In reality, only a very small usage. (And our water, suburban, is not as bad as some). Pur advertises 2-3 months? Get real!!!!"
2,Didn't last long,"I bought this 2 pack about 6 weeks ago and installed one almost immidiately. however, that one is showing RED LED just after 5 weeks. Now I have installed the second one.. hope this second refill last little longer.."
2,Annoying,I had hope for this product but in truth it was more annoying than helpful. Broke pretty fast and even when it did work it was all that great. The water still tasted off.
5,good price!,I always purchase these because the cost is so much better than buying them at the store!
1,Water tastes terrible.,This is like a bad ripoff generic from China or something. I've used this product before and this is not the same. Almost not drinkable. No improvement over tap water.
1,Purr 3 Stage,"I replaced three of the Purr 3 stage filters for my mother-inlaw in approximately 1 year. We kept replacing the unit because she had an initial investment in a 6 pack of filters, but after the 3rd unit failed we decided to cut our losses. The units would leak upon initiation of the filter. I took the last unit apart and it was apparent that the internal o-ring seals were being damaged by the twisting action associated with activating the filter. We have had a Teledyne unit for over ten years and never experience a problem. Needless to say, the mother-inlaw will have a new Teledyne unit in the near future. Apparently, Teledyne has better rocket scientists........."
1,product was defective,"2 of the water filters were letting off little black dots into the water. But, we were able to return the product."
5,Gives you the ability to try to control some part of your environment,I like these after reading information on the Pur website [...]. I have often wondered if our community water was cleared of all those pills.
4,great product!,"easy to install and change, makes the water taste better and gives me some peace of mind :-). now i don't have to buy plastic bottled water and add to the landfill! i have to change mine every month."
1,way too expensive,"Notice it says ""UP to 100 gallons"". It doesn't filter anywhere near that much water. We have a softener system that uses potassium. We have very good water when it reaches this filter. Yet, this filter can only process about 22 gallons a month before it needs to be replaced... it just stops working. I know exactly how much it uses before it ""dies"" because I fill a crock with the filtered water and drink from that. The crock holds 2 1/2 gallons and I fill it twice a week. I replaced the filter on Jan 8 and it needs replacing today Feb 12.... exactly 5 weeks later. I've gone through 5 gallons of water a week for the first 4 weeks and today could only get 2 more gallons out of the filter for a total of 22 gallons. There has to be a better way...."
1,Some feedback about filters,"I have not purchased these filters from Amazon and judging by the reviews I'll probably buy them where I purchased the unit to make sure the packaging looks OK. I'm posting here to let folks know that I contacted Pur about the way the filter works; is it a granulated active carbon (GAC) filter or a solid block of activated carbon? They informed me that it is a solid block of activated carbon. If you are going to purchase ANY type of water filtering system it needs to be activated carbon in solid block form, so I was pleased with their answer. I am now more inclined to believe their claims on the types of materials that it can filter. Go to [...] and check out their products if you're still skeptical and are looking for a different manufacturer. I'm going to give the Pur filter a try, but just not going to buy what sounds like knock-off replacement filters here!"
2,"Amazingly, it leaves behind healthful fluoride ??","Just bought a package of these and noticed it says ""Amazingly, it leaves behind healthful fluoride, along with a clean, fresh taste!""Now I don't know about you but I have learned that fluoride is highly toxic (a by-product of aluminum manufacturing) it is also one of the main ingredients in some RAT POISON. I want a water filter to REMOVE fluoride not promote it!!! Do some research, fluoride is toxic and we have been programed to believe it helps reduce tooth decay! GET THIS: The ADA recently came out and said that too much of it actually creates tooth decay! Insanity..........."
4,PUR Filters,"PUR makes a good product, that's why we purchased these items; however, I have contacted PUR with questions in the past and have never received responses from them. Don't know that we will continue to purchase PUR because of poor customer service, but it still doesn't diminish the quality of their filters."
4,"Water taste great! I have used Brita, and Zero and this one takes the cake for me.","User of both Brita and Zero filters in the past, both pitcher and faucet type. As for performance, value and taste, I love the overall value that these Pur filters bring."
4,water filter,"Good value ,the filters work very well, I would always buy these filters again.Sometimes they are a little difficult to unscrew for people who dont have much strength. Nevertheless, these are great filters."
1,Pur Mineral Faucet Refill,"I no longer use this system. After only 5 months, the system fell off my faucet and will not snap back on. The refill cartridges quickly filled with debris and I was having to replace it about every three weeks. The system needs a top bracket so that all of the weight will not be on the bottom. Also, it was constantly in the way when I needed the sink. I would not recommend this system."
4,GONE-GONE-GONE.......GONE SHOOOTAaaannnn.....,"The dvd's...very cool. The highway to hell tour poster...nice. The other doo-hinkies are junk. No guitar pic. On a 1 to 10 scale...I still give this a 10. True ac/dc fans will appreciate this for it's content; hard-charging, ELECTRIC Rock'n Roll. Blues-zee too. There is one spot where Angus and Brian are being interviewed, and the interviewer makes a comment regarding David Lee Roth's comments about Van Halen VERSUS AC/DC;You see David, then back to Angus, who nonchalantly couldn't give a sht.It's awesome.Gone shootin? Two versions. Phil Rudd? Genuine tough guy. Oh..and the rare high school footage stuff. Very awesome.Need I go further? Bottom line....Entertainment treat."
1,"Obnoxious, pompous and full of self-importance...","This was an absolutely horrible comeback album from 1989. I never liked the Airplane/Starship. I have always found them to be obnoxious, pompous and full of self-importance, like ELP without any talent or Spinal Tap without the laughs. And this CD is horrible even by those standards. There are incredibly dumb lyrics about loving jet planes and flying into the sun. My favorite dumb lyric is ""Why do we remember the past but not the future?"" Well, duh! My favorite pompous lyric is ""I want to live in a world that pays teachers more than baseball players"". Hey, how about rock stars? Especially washed up has-beens. Gimme a break. Other than a couple of songs you can hear on classic hits, these guys suck!"
5,Quiet and powerful.,I used this to replace a blower on a wood insert stove. It is orders of magnitude quieter and more powerful than the OE. Highly recommend.
1,Junk,"This is a piece of junk. The gripper starts to unscrew for the pole once you start trying to unscrew the bulb. Even when I drilled a hole to hold the gripper in place the pole loosened once I started turning counterclockwise. If there's a better product, please let us know."
1,Don't bother,"This kit fit on top of my Mr. Long Arm. But, that's all it did. Not one single component actually managed to get that flood light out of my ceiling. One component actually snapped apart when it went around the flood light. Waste of my time and money."
3,Pretty good ...,"... if you like your herbs from the herb store, that is. And if you like the TCM view of things.I prefer books about herbs that I can grow myself, or pick in my back yard. I'm really not all that enthusiastic about books about exotics that I have to buy from far away places.I also prefer books that focus on herbs used in the western herbal tradition. This book has just a tad too much of an emphasis on Chinese herbs for my tastes.Finally, I _like_ books with one single, sometimes enormous, index. This one has two. I'm always looking things up in the wrong one, in books like this.YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary), of course."
3,magazine recycles,"I am a fan of his ""technical"" writing, however, this book reads more like payback type magazine articles for trips, guide services, etc. I really wanted to like it, but..."
2,Important safety tip! Hazardous waste is dangerous!,"Despite the superb acting this movie just did not cut it.Here are some of my random thoughts after watching it.Is it just me or is that the most miserable and unhappy town in America?Midway through the movie I was ready to stick my head into one of those toxic drums.The fact that a warehouse full of deadly toxic waste was being guarded by a couple of beer drinking Mexicans in lawn chairs was laughable.The scene where Auntie was suddenly overjoyed to move out of the only house she ever lived in was a mystery in itself.The weirdest part of the movie though, was when the toxic waste boss suddenly realizes that toxic waste is.......toxic.At the end when the guy announces he was quitting, Auntie is overjoyed to be moving out and everyone is in love, I was expecting a giant Wizard of Oz rainbow to be there when she opened the door and announced ""What a beautiful day!"""
2,"good movie idea, but not really a movie","What the heck did we just watch here? This is not a completed film, it's a rough outline for what could be a great movie, but not more than that. I don't even know how to describe it. Most definitely NOT worth purchasing. If you're bored and intrigued enough to really want to see Colin Firth at his absolute worst, then rent it for 50c.As I said though, the basic *idea* is really quite full of potential, but it goes absolutely nowhere, and in the end, I expect 99% of the viewers will be asking the same question I started this ""review"" with."
3,Surprise ending,"The movie has a surprise ending. Meaning, it ends and you are surprised because there was no resolution or even a decent conflict. It was like 90 min of exposition with wonderful acting. Then is just kinda ended. Did they run out of money to finish the film? Maybe the big name actors got better jobs and just quit? Very strange."
1,90 min of my life that I'll never get back,what a waste of film and what a greater waste of filmmakers money. it saddens me to think that there wasn't something better out there to spend film making money on. Is this all we have to watch. this is 90 min of my life that I'll never get back.
2,Where is Spessart?,"I have been waiting impatiently for someone to make available ""Das Wirtshaus im Spessart"" in the NTSC format. There must be others out there who, like I, have the fondest memories of this lovely Lilo Pulver romp from a half-century ago. ""Das Spukschloss im Spessart"" is anotherKurt Hoffmann gem that is unavailable in NTSC. Must I buy a PAL to NTSC converter to re-experience the great fun that these two wonderful films?"
2,"Rice, yes, Dol Sot Bibim Bap, no","This cooker makes excellent rice. But so do the other two rice cookers in my kitchen. I bought this specifically for the Dol Sot Bibim Bap setting, and was very disappointed. I followed the instructions, but the cooker did not brown the rice on the bottom, which, as far as I am concerned, is the whole point of the dish. :-) If I run the cycle twice, I get do get browning, but I also get dried out rice too chewy to serve.If you are looking for well-made brown or white rice, this is fine. But if you want dol sot bibim bap, this won't produce it for y ou."
5,Great rice and hard/soft boiled eggs,"This rice cooker is great. It makes great rice both white and brown. I was also pleasantly surprised at how well it makes hard boiled eggs. They turn out a lot better than boiling them in water. I punch a pin hole on the end of each egg before steaming them in the machine and the hard boiled eggs come out just like in a restaurant, if not better. You also do not have to do 8 at a time, just steam them for a few less minutes."
3,Messy clean up,"We have had this product for over 5 years. It makes great rice. Good for small kitchens and for small families. The downside to this product is the messy clean up! Since there is no moisture collector on the unit, the moisture collects underneath the inner lid and then drips out onto the inner lip of the rice cooker. It seems gross that the moisture would collect on the inside where the rice is cooking. Will have to replace this rice cooker for no other reason than for hygiene purposes."
1,Max life 4 years. Cannot replace internal battery. Don't buy!!,"My 4 year old Sanyo ECJ-F50S rice cooker clock timer died because of a dead battery. Now it requires a strange series of (undocumented) button presses to get started at all. Programming delayed cooking is a problem. Called Sanyo service center 800-421-5013 for help. They said that battery requires major disassembly of the unit AND that Sanyo service centers do not offer a battery replacement service. I asked for instructions or even a diagram. ""Sorry, we do not provide that"". Another toxic electronic device designed to fill the dump after just 4 years- designed to pollute the earth. Apparantly other ECJ models have the same problem. Sanyos, how green is that? I am not buying any more products from this envionmentally irresponsible company.Sanyo ECJ-F50S Micro-Computerized 5-Cup Rice Cooker and Steamer"
