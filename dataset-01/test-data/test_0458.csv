2,Problem product,"The first time I used this chipper it worked for about 15 minutes, then stopped. I tried ererything to get it to operate again - no luck, the motor would not start. I called the McCulloch 800 number in the manual, asking for a location for warranty service. They gave me two agencies in my area. I phoned both, and no, they are no longer associated with McCulloch products. I fianlly got back to the 800 number, they referred me to another source about 60 miles from me. They said they would take care of this. Let's hope so. I don't think Amazon should be selling an item that is not easily put in for warranty service!"
1,"Beware, assembly, leaves and grass only","The review complaints about the installation instructions are justified. They appear to be poorly translated from some other language. The grammar is often nonsensical. The word ""of"" is used in place of ""up"" and in place of ""and"". The low-res images are worthless.However the unit assembly is not too complicated. If you throw away the instructions and you're mechanically inclined (know how cotter pins and locking washers work) you should be able to assemble the unit.I hoped this $220 unit would be an economical alternative to $600 units, so long as I had light-duty use. The unit worked great for 15 seconds then jammed locedk on a 1"" twig. I have to disassemble the unit to clear the jam.I'll probably roll this unit into next week's trash, then pony up the $600 for something that works."
2,miss brown,"This item waste of money, takes all day to do a few leaves needs to have a larger opening to put the leaves and sticks in you have to stand there all day to put a handful of leaves in rediculous!"
1,"wrong machine , broken up machine, bad seller!","Florida Seashell, the sender deserve NO star1) she send me a MC Culloch MS 2003 of a lesser value while she advertise a MCS 20012) If this was not enough, the machine was all BROKEN UP and the broken pieces were not even in the box(it show that it was broken before the item was sent)3)the seller said that it was not broken when she sent it!4)the shipping was 48$, I still have not received from the seller instruction/money, on how to return the item.The machine is big , heavy and still sitting in my living room waiting to be returned."
1,Unsatisfactory for Garden Refuge,"Home and Beyond substitued a MCS2001 for the Yard Machine these three machines look like they are all basically the same machine,The MCS2001 I returned as ""Unsatisfactory for purpose intended!""Shredding Garden Refuge.Ten to twelve clog ups in less than 2 hours, with less than ten gallons of work done.This machine has an inherent design flaw for shredding moist or slightly green materials.It would probably work fine if all you wanted to do were chipping of absolutely dry pruning materials."
1,Don't buy!,"I purchased this in April '11. After 3 uses (on mesquite and juniper branches, less than 0.5"" thick), the cutter bush sheared off. Authorized McCulloch dealers would not do warranty work because McCulloch has been purchased by another company and they cannot get reimbursed. I had the bush replaced at my own expense. After 2 more uses (more small mesquite branches), the V-cutter broke. The V-cutter is a wear item, even if your's doesn't break you will eventually need to replace it because of wear. The V-cutter is not available anywhere, it is discontinued."
4,Remarkably informative for specialists and laymen alike,"I had been studying ancient Egypt for over 20 years before I read Sauneron's book, and I was amazed at how little I knew about the day-to-day lives of the priests who stood near the very center of Egyptian society. The book is well-written, nicely illustrated, and easily read, mixing technical titles for the various types of priests with personal vignettes describing their lives and how their roles as priests affected and were affected thereby. I truly hope that this goes back into print, but will some future publisher PUH-LEEZE include an index and some maps?! It was difficult for me, a specialist, to track down specific bits of data, so it must surely be very hard on those who don't have a whole library of books like this at their disposal. On the plus side, however, thumbing through the book to find a particular passage can lead one down some very interesting by-ways which might otherwise be overlooked by over-particularism."
2,only 1 pack,"one pack was received, torn open and empty; at the bottom of the crate was a huge hole; 6 posts were rolling around at the bottom; i don't know how many were sent; how many were lost, how many i did not receive; you need to perfect packing so this does not happen again"
1,bad service,Paid for it but never got it. Got my money back from Amazon but got excuses from shoplet. Now they want me to remove the negative rating. No way
1,NOT OEM!!,"Be careful...look the same, but NOT OEM! Six little holes, not THREE larger ones as on original. CHEAP for a reason.. TERRIBLE! Why allowed to sell on AMAZON?"
1,Junk!,"Do not be fooled by the Motorola ""M"" in the picture...these are NOT made by Motorola, and the real item delivered does not have the (M) on it. I only got sound out of one side, there was also a lot of background buzzing and interference because these are not shielded headphones. Later, the same day i recieved them, the connector (mini-usb) fell apart. They seem too good to be true for the price, but I figured maybe if they were even just ""ok"" I could use them for a while. They only lasted 30 minuted before they went in the trash."
2,Motorola Headset,"These headphones look like legit headphone since they look exactly like the other set that i lost, but the sound quality was absolutely awful. If you're looking for SQ, look somewhere else."
2,Motorola ear bud,It works fine as long as it is in your ear. I have trouble with it falling out of my ear while working out.
5,Best that ive used,Comparing to other brands stereo headphones that I've used with other cellphones these are the best that I've used.
2,A WASTE OF TIME,"DIDN'T LIKE THIS MOVIE AT ALL. PRETTY MUCH WORSE THAN A B MOVIE. POOR WRITING, POOR ACTING AND A WASTE OF MONEY. THE JUNK THEY MAKE TODAY...."
2,Useless indoors,"This camera is is compact and easy to use, but I have yet to get a viewable video indoors. I've had every light in the room on - more than required to read a book on the couch, yet the video is dark and blurry. Outdoors it's better but the recordings of my daughter's soccer game are still dicey if I use the zoom. Overall it's just a waste of time and money to try and capture family moments with this camera."
4,Nice camera. Works fine for basic recordings. A light would be very helpfull,"It's a fine camera for personal or basic recordings, various functions and effects, nice zoom, easy to use. Should come with a light to record at night or in dark places (there's a similar model with light though...)"
2,Jury is still out,"I bought this for my 9 year old son to take movies and edit on the PC. It worked for about 2 days before there was no image from the lens to either the LCD or the viewfinder. I could see other information on the LCD, such as the date, time, menu, but no image from the screen. I called Samsung and that is where it is now for repairs. A check of the web indicated that this problem is well documented. I did try to install the software that came with the camera, but that did not go to well either. I will retry when I get a working camera again."
1,samsung sc-d363,"Don't buy this camera. And if you own one, like me, don't capture your precious family moments with this camera. The video quality is very bad, with red tones shifted towards the magenta. It is almost imposible to get good focus with the camera, even in manual focus mode. The motors that drive the tape are extremely noisy. All this noise is unfortunatelly captured forever in your recordings. Battery life is also very short. The built-in SD card for tapeless recordings is a hoax; the pictures are worst than the ones captured from the cheapest camera phone, they also have the same problem with the red tones, captured as magentas. The video captured on the SD card, is low quality recording not acceptable for a video camera. Save a few more dollars and go with a better camera. You will get what you paid for with this camera."
3,pretty much a failure,"The problem with this film is that although both are good actors, Jean Artur and John Wayne just seems to have no chemistry even in the clinches. I don't think they much liked each other and it showed? She comes off a minor eastern type and he seems to be cast as an insensitive brute of a cowboy who cares for his horse more than his girl friend ( pretty much like the modern guy who spends all his time working on his car instead of keeping his wife and kids happy). They say opposites attract, but it doesn't show up here on film! Interesting that Clark Gable could make one of these romantic comedies and it would become a classic, John Wayne should fall flat in the same type of movie? I think what results is like having two straight men and no comic."
3,Good Romantic Comedy; Terrible DVD,"This is far from Jean Arthur's classic comedies of the late 1930s and the early 40s, but she's as charming as ever. John Wayne is also surprisingly good as the romantic leading man, but the film is a showcase for Jean Arthur's talents from beginning to end (it was produced by her husband).The DVD, however, is terrible. Its watchable, but you feel like you're watching the film on 1980s VHS, late night TV or one of those cheap public domain DVDs. The image is very soft, there are visible scratches and the sound is very bad. Still, I doubt that Criterion will ever pick a film like this one, so if you like 1940s romantic comedies, and Jean Arthur in particular, you should ""take a chance"" on this one."
4,Good Deal,"First of all this is the cheaper option as apposed to buying each component separately such as the lenses or collar.the collar is flat on the sides to prevent rolling.The collar can hold lens so there is no need to unscrew the bezel and replace the lens unless you are replacing the clear lens which I did. I am using this kit for a 6d Maglite the heat from the bulb creates little bubbles in the lens where dirt builds up for some reason. I use the red lens for night-vision when I am out camping. The blue I do not use often, supposedly it is used for fog conditions. The mounts are very durable I have them mounted on the side of my trucks bed. I had them on the sides of the seat at one point, but the mounts grip on the light was so tight I ripped off the seats side pieces."
1,complete garbage,"Im over seas , and thought i would buy a guitar to help pass time by , and also practice up ...In shortthe guitar looked great , the packaging was good ...The guitar was unplayable , many many deadspots ..even after spending hours trying to make adjustments .I finally got the guitar to play from frets 1-11 pretty decent .., anything after that did not work.Not sure if the guitar was just a defect , or if there all like that ...if they are ..DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!"
4,Can't Beat It for the Price,"Like the title of the review says, this baby is a piece of work. Sounds beautiful after tuning and stays in tune forever. Hooks up nicely to an amp and sound really resonates clearly.The only problem I've found is that the amp jack on the bottom is only very loosely inserted into the body of the guitar so that it comes out whenever I take the amp out. Not a major concern, but noteworthy. Also, I would be cool if there were an upper peg for a guitar strap.All in all, great sound for a great price. Awesome for people who just want to mess around strumming."
5,It works,Not really much to say beyond it works and the jacks stay in place. The 10 foot cord is a big bonus and for 4 bucks it's really hard to knock anything about it
5,Perfect for the audio hook up from my laptop to tv,I bought this cable to be used from audio out on my laptop to the audio input on my tv. This cable works perfectly. Its extremely light and fits snuggly into both output and input.
1,Horrible,I bought this to replace my moniter cable for my Samsung LCD (the cable I was currently using had a short in it). This cable was even worse. The ghosting was so bad that I could barely read any of the text on my screen. Companies shouldn't even be selling cables this bad.
2,Uninspired,"Crota is A.O.K, but it is slow, predictable, and lacks any kind of twist in the plot. You'll know what is going to happen every time the Crota attacks, after you finish reading about the first one."
4,Great horror filled book.......,"I liked this book a lot. The suspense, the terror, gore scenes and all that. It was his first book and there is always bound to be flaws. Some parts were like, yeah right, like that would really happen, but for the most part it was fun and entertaining. He reminds me of a younger and tougher gerneation of Graham Masterton who is my all time favorite. I especially love horror books pertaining to the American Indians and their Gods. I love those stories. I Feel for the the American Indians for what the settlers did to them. That is sad and unforgivable. They are the real Americans not us settlers and it is understandable that in this book, he made the gore scenes really explicit and that was what made it so entertaining. you will NOT be disappointed with this book, TRUST ME!!"
5,Second Incredible Series from James Burke,"Whether the second series of Connections is better or worse that the original is a matter of some arguement, but that they are both great is not. Why? Because for once someone was able to communicate history in an exciting and faciating form, showing that every person, event, or invention relates in some way to every other. Imagine a ""six degrees of separation"" through history, mix in a strong sense of how to tell the _story_ of history, add in a wicked sense of humor and wit, and you might have some idea of the brilliance of this show.Until amazon gets it listed, you can also buy the first series directly from Abrose Video (ambrosevideo.com), but they are all worth owning."
5,Nice Overview,"This book takes a no nonsense, chronological approach to telling the Tull story. Each album and track is handled in order of release, with tour info and other items of interest, such as band comings and goings (and they have had many!). I like this approach, personally, because the music tells the story for me anyway. If you are a casual fan and feel like digging a little deeper beyond the Classic Rock hits, there is something for you. You may even find yourself buying the reissues due out this year. Rabid Tull fans will enjoy reading what a fellow fan has to say."
5,It works!,I got this for my husband for Christmas but was a bit skeptical. It actually works! Highly recommended!
4,Very useful collection of information.,This book is very useful to the green Legal Nurse Consultant. Very useful and mostly relevant guidance and suggestions by the authors. My only negative comment would be it is in need of a revision to bring it up to speed with the current technology available and in use by the professional audience.
3,Why??,Cena is a 10 time champion and already has more than 2 3-disc set out. Hey I do like the guy but shouldn't some other guys in the back have a disc out instead of him? I don't even know what to rate it as I doubt I'll but it. I bet I already have everything on disc already.
5,old reliable,"the product arrived quickly. the price was right. it's about the same product i bought a decade or two ago. that one is still working well -- just a few paint scrapes from hard use. i expect this one will last for almost ever as well. if what you want is durable and simple, it doesn't get any better than this."
4,Choose LED instead of krypton,"If you need a flashlight as a baton, then this is your choice. If you need a bright flashlight, might as well get a Maglite LED, or you can spend around $20 on a LED upgrade kit ( which is around the cost of the Maglite 5D cell ). The flashlight itself is quite light but when it's loaded with 5 D Cell batteries, it's very heavy, not something you wanna carry around on a hiking trip. The glossy black colour, can be a little slippery and attracts finger prints & greasy. These don't happen to another Maglite flashlite of mine, which is CAMO in colour. When I was screwing back the top, a metal shard went into my finger, so, pls handle with cautious. If I were to buy another Maglite, I will definitely get a LED version. Worth every penny."
1,Doc Hudson,I'm in shock as to how much this costs. It is a Christmas resent for my grandson who is two years old and will never appreciate the present.
4,My Favorite Squeeze Album,"This album didn't sell and I rarely heard anything from it on the radio. Nonetheless, it's maybe my favorite album by Squeeze, (compilations not included).What was originally Side 1 is especially good. Dark but good. Don't get any ideas though.Good luck getting your hands on one of these babies."
1,Not for small children,"My four year old loves the Care Bears, but this movie scared her (and even kind of freaked me out) especially the blue evil guy, and the monsters in the closet. Even the music was creepy and weird (like a throwback to a bad sitcom soundtrack), and the graphics and storyline are not well done compared to the other Care Bear movie we ordered. I would say skip this one, and order the Oopsy Bear Care Bear movie, or the Joke a Lot Care Bear movie."
2,Bummer!,"As someone who enjoyed Good In Bed and In Her Shoes, I was sorely disappointed with Godnight Nobody. While I am always ready to suspend reality while reading fiction, not a thing rang true about the characters in this book or the situations they were faced with. I was particularly disappointed with how completely unlikeable the main character was, which I'm assuming was unintentionally done by the author and the lack of resolution of the main character's relationships at the end of the book. The best way to describe this book is hollow, although if you are looking for an easy read, with only ocassional entertainment value, this might work."
3,average for Ms. Weiner,"I love Jennifer Weiner's books. She always creates characters who are relatable and the stories are generally heartfelt. I think this one, though, was just average. Adding the change-up of solving the murder with her usual character development and touching stories just didn't work for me."
4,Don't count it out,"I have read the reviews, and I know a lot of readers felt this was not one of her best books--but it's still pretty darn funny.Especially the way the main character describes the ""supermom's"". We all know them, we all feel the way the main character feels about that--you don't have to live in a weathly suburb of NYC to identify. Kate Klien, like all of this authors main characters makes you as the reader feel ok, she's relatable. And the story itself, it's interesting enough.What doesn't work about this book, you are left with a feeling of uncertainity about Kate's life, especially her marriage. And you feel cheated as a reader as much as I am sure Kate feels cheated by her partner in marriage. Bottom line, it's worth reading just for the funny suburb descriptions, but it's not as good as her other books."
4,Very enjoyable!,"This book is a joy to read. I am about half way through and pretty often, I catch myself laughing out loud! Jennifer Weiner is a very witty writer and her characters are very personable. Don't hesitate to buy this one!"
3,Sputtered at the end,"I admire Jennifer Weiner for stretching out and attempting a suburban mystery novel with Goodnight Nobody, while using her trademark wit and humor to expose the banalities of married life in the suburbs. Unfortunately, the book that she has produced is not entirely convincing as either a mystery or as a satire on suburban life. Potentially, this book could have been a truly unique creation, as it would bring together these two elements to produce an amusing novel that combines the fun of pulp fiction with some light social commentary. Weiner doesn't quite pull it off, but there are enough enjoyable moments in the book (particularly in the beginning, which is very funny and quite promising) to make it a wortwhile read. That being said, the book staggers to the end and this leaves you with the feeling that you've read just a mediocre mystery book that had the promise of something much greater."
3,Worst Jennifer Weiner novel....,"I have to start off this review saying I love, love, Jennifer Weiner's books. However, this one was a major disappointment! For once I had a protagnist that ended up irritating me to no end. Also there were too many plots going on with the murder mystery, the former crush, the disapproving husband, the wacky glamorous best friend that I felt overwhelmed.The other problem I had were the constant flashbacks! I hate them in movies and I hate them in books. To go back and forth between the present, the murder mystery, and her past with her mother, her father, her best friend, the former crush ugh! It was too much.Honestly Weiner would have been better served to have just dropped the murder mystery and wrote about a housewife that feels trapped and meets up with a former crush, etc."
2,Sadly disappointed,"First I would like to say that Jennifer Weiner has quickly become one of my favorite authors. I can always identify with her main characters. I am sad to say, however, that this book was just not good. I can usually plow through her books in 1-2 days, but this thing took me two weeks to read. I just couldn't get into it. The main character is pretty pathetic. I got tired of hearing how inadequate and frumpy she was. She was never fully developed into a character that could be likeable. The entire plot dragged on until the last two chapters of the book, where the ending was rushed and somewhat unresolved. I think that Jennifer Weiner should just stick to her usual style of writing and not get caught up in a mystery again."
2,Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn,"As a stay @ home Dad, my wife told me this might be something I could relate to. But not--the world of minivans, swanky subdivisions,is the last thing I can relate to."
1,Disappointed,"This was a terrible book. I had a difficult time getting through it and finally gave up and skimmed through to the end. None of the characters were fully developed. The plot was completely unrealistic. It was not at all funny. I was shocked that so many professional reviewers seemed to love such a flat, poorly written story. I won't buy another of this author's novels."
3,Arrggh,"I tried so hard to really like this book. I mean it is pretty entertaining but after awhile the main character starts to be unlikeable since she is so mean to her undeserving husband. Then the book just ends and that should have been a good thing IF all the loose ends where tied together and somekind of closure could be made but no. Nothing. It made me wonder what happend to this, that etc. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say but this book was just disapointing."
1,where is she going with this?,"I am completely with Anne. I just took this book on a weekend getaway, as I've really enjoyed JW's other books. How did this get published? It was choppy, farfetched, and tried too hard. I was extremely disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"This book was disappointing. I have read all of Jennifer Weiner's prior books in 2-3 days, tops. This one took me 3 weeks and I wound up with a late fine at the library.I was very surprised to find myself immersed in a mystery novel - it's as if Mrs. Weiner is attempting a genre hop. I say stick to chick lit and leave murder mysteries alone!Overall the book felt like a flat cola - you still get the caffeine but none of the fizz."
4,"Another Good, but not great read","Following in the mediocre steps of Little Earthquakes, Jennifer Weiner once again delivers the story of mother's and how their children affect their lives. While this novel is full of mystery, it still lacks what Good in Bed and In Her Shoes had- laughter. I still found it an enjoyable read but the ending left me wanting more and with a feeling that the story was unresolved. Sequel maybe?"
2,Major Disappointment from a Huge Weiner Fan,"I too was very disappointed in this book. I have read all Weiner's books and this was, by far, the worst. The mystery aspect was terrible and I felt misleading regarding the ""real"" Kitty Cavanaugh. The unresolved ending really bothered me too.I will still eagerly await Weiner's next project, but do hope it will be better than her last!"
3,Great performance of immature pieces,"When I learned of Mendelssohn's piano concertos, I immediately wanted to buy them. Much to my dismay, his popular g-minor piano concerto was short and immature, devoid of any real merit.Although it is an elegant piece, it certainly doesn't compare with the piano concertos of other important composers. The d-minor concrto is a bit better (despite being less famous), but not by much. With the rather the limited violin repertoire, the very famous violin concerto is excellent, but that's not why I bought this CD. The saving grace of this disc is its performances. Serkin is an excellent pianist, and Sterne an excellent violinist 9both of these statements go without saying). Ormandy's typically lush strings are perfect for Mendelssohn's light compositional style. All in all, the pieces are inadequate, but you might want to buy the CD for the performances."
5,5 star,A very handy addition to the hand held KitchenAid Mixer. A must have for whipping. I highly recommend this tool.
5,stacked,"There were a perfect fit and quite comfortable. I wear them under a long skirt, no problem walking, no tripping."
1,wrong clamps,"The clamps indicate they join two 3"" exhaust components but they don't. These clamps are known as lap joints and I ordered but joint connectors. They would not work in my application and had to be returned. Not sure if the error was the fault of the seller or mfg but they were worthless to me. The seller would not give me a refund and only offered me an exchange. I'm still waiting and needless to say my exhaust rebuild is on hold due to the time they are taking and the fact they won't refund. I have this sinking feeling that I'm going to get the same ""wrong"" clamps when they finally send the replacement parts. Avoid these clamps and this seller."
3,episodes a mystery in themselves!,"Unfortunately, most of these individual DVDs and VHS are being sold here without a list of the episodes included. And since most versions are selling the SAME episodes in smaller or bigger numbers, you should double-check ALL THE TIME in order to avoid buying repeats.Now, why aren't all episodes being listed?Something easily done,right? One wonders...Close to half of the episodes in this series are not available (yet).For the last 5 years or so, they have been rehashing the SAME episodes.WHY?So be alert! and lets all (the fans) INSIST on making available the other half of the episodes!!!"
1,Poor transfers,"The reason for the wide discrepancy in reviews for this cd: several distinguished performances, but the sound on most tracks is very primitive. This is due to the digitalization process used: AAD. Nowadays, this almost never occurs; pre-digital recordings are digitally remastered, and designated as ADD. AAD cd's are carelessly transferred, and sound much worse than the original LP-intended records--tubby, ill-balanced, strange overtones, uneven volumes, raw and overblown. This early practice caused many to believe that cd could not reproduce sound comparable to vinyl.CBS/Sony should be ashamed to present these performances in such poor sound, when a modern remastering could easily have been done. Szell, Walter, Casadesus and others would never have approved such shoddy releases, but they are long gone, and their artistic legacies are here trashed. This disc is a slap in the face to some of the finest performing musicians of the 20th century."
5,Italians in America our Contributions,This DVD should make all Italian Americans proud. We aren't only gangsters!! I am Proud to be an American of Italian descent...It is Surprising to find out what famous people are unknowingly Italian.
2,"Lots of filler, not much meat","This is a cursory look at someone who must be a fascinating man. A not-so-fascinating book about a fascinating man. Half the book is not even on Li, it's a history lesson of Hong Kong and China."
4,Excellent mountaineering scenes,"Hijacked and subsequently downed RAF plane on NATO test flight crashes on top of a hitherto unscaled mountain peak on the Turkish-Russian border.The West and the Russians send teams to get to the plane first. The West to destroy it, the Russians to inspect it, as their technology is behind in this area.And then both teams have to get down the mountain in worsening weather.There are plenty of Garvean twists and turns in the plot to keep you reading."
1,"Very disappointed , Small is not the word.","Pendant looks as if it came from a gum ball machine. Very disappointed in the way it looks.."""
4,Good for the price,"Worked as expected.If you have trouble because the fit is too tight, file the outside plastic of the male connector (which might be the connector from your power supply; not necessarily one of the connectors of this splitter) until it fits. But first make sure the problem isn't misaligned pins (which can be straightened without much trouble)."
2,Boring...Boring...Boring,"On page 160 I thought....well, when is something going to happen? This book went nowhere, and while it was fast reading to.. nowhere, I found it to be a waste of my time. I find it amazing that I am the only reviewer that found the book to be uneventful, and not even that exciting when trying to establish the bond between the two girls. How mundane, and how pathetic, that the most interesting thing about this book was the soup!!!"
5,K&N Cold Air Intake,Amazon Stricke againInstall This K&N; cold intake with Thottle space Ana WOW it Woke this Toyota Tacoma V6 right upjust to here it when you step on it passing the car next to you and getting on the free wayWOW oh what a feeling
4,they really move like a compass,don't need to write alot about a cuff link..what you see is what you get and they move like a real compass.i believe they do point north when held correctly (vertically and still) - although i wouldn't set out across the ocean relying on them!i am very pleased.
2,"It's a script, not a book.","Decided to purchase this based on my love of the Nutshell Kids segments in the Scholastic Video Series and rave reviews by others of Really Rosie. It was not what I expected. It is perfect if you want to put on a production of Really Rosie. It's also perfect if want the sheet music for the musical numbers. But if you want to read Pierre, Alligators All Around, One Was Johnny, and Chicken Soup With Rice in book form, I highly recommend the box set on offer; my 3-year-old loves them."
2,What happened here?,"I love this series but this book (#8) and the next one must have been written by a different author as it deviates so extremely from the formula used in all the other 30+ of the series. It is trying to become some kind of spy novel, but very badly done. Things like Buchers ability to speak certain languages and even the way the hit price on him was upped are in direct contrast to even the book before this. I doubt whoever wrote this ever read the 7 preceeding books. Not recommended. Neither is the next novel, but #10 and the rest get back into the feel of the early novels and are GREAT!"
5,Now an all-time favorite of mine.,"Have watched this mini-series twice since I received it and I can sum it up in one word ... WOW! The character development, sub-plots, relationships and conversation in this, George Elliot's best work, are a feast for any BBC production devotee. The complexity of the theme(s) in the book as well as the intricate relationships are well portrayed.This mini-series is must viewing that satisfies the intellect as well as all the other senses involved in entertainment. Be prepared for a long sitting as you won't be able to tear yourself away once you begin the first disc."
2,A dumbing down of Eliot's masterpiece.,"Does away with most of the social issues, including the growth of the merchantile class and cross-class marriage. Poor casting/poor scripting of Rosamund and Fred Vincy and Mary Garth (Eliot's Mary doesn't speak with a working class accent, but Andrew Davies' (scriptwriter) does) and family. I may be picking nits, but this movie turns a very intelligent novel into a simple romance.And there's none of Eliot's witty humor!!Read the book instead..."
2,"Works, Some of the Time","This scale does work, and seems to be accurate. However,it occasionally ""resets"" and looses its calibration. This seems to happen more often when the room is cooler but is not limited to those conditions. When it acts up, I have to turn it off, back on and re-do the calibration. It is a bit of a hassle if I am weighing a bunch of charges. When it is not acting up it seems quite accurate. The scale pan that was included was to shallow to prevent powder from bouncing out when tricked in from just a few cm away. It does provide a multitude of units like grams, grains, Oz. that make it useful for several tasks."
2,"Cheap, but doesn't last.","I purchased one of these about a year ago for measuring powder for reloading. I found it easy to use and reasonably accurate (.01Gr) and anticipated several years of use. Unfortunately as I worked my way into the second year of use the scale simply went off the deep end. There were many ""ERR"" screens and it wouldn't hold a measuring mode (grain vs gram) so had to go into the trash. If it were durable I would recommend it but if I want a cheap, made in China model I'll buy one of the many inexpensive ""portable"" models."
5,Great Air intake!,I have a 2005 ford f-150 and i immediately noticed a huge leap in power and sound after i installed my K&N air intake! I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to feel a boost in power and even a nice low rumble at about 3000 RPMs.
5,MUST HAVE,"GREAT PRODUCT! i bought this and installed it in about an hour. the biggest difference i noticed is the sound of the engine which is way better. i tested the horsepower before and after and it did increase. my gas mileage did not increase, but mostly because i drive with a lead foot to hear and feel my new found power. this made driving in a big city fun for me again"
1,Don't buy!,"The ""holdings"" and facts in this hornbook are wrong. Cases such as Harris and Clark contain horrible inaccuracies. Hope this helps."
4,Excellent Introduction to First Year Law,This author explains the fundamental but essential concepts in a clear and concise manner through his text and flow charts. Numerous real-life examples help the first-year law student and/or taxpayer grasp important rationales that will allow practical application in his/her own life and on the exams. I highly recommend this book.
3,works but not great,I have used the gel a few times but it does not prevent fogging. It delays it. I was expecting a better product.
1,"Awful, cheap",This looks like it was made by one person with a video camera. He actually bumps the camera once and it's not even edited out. If this was a youtube video it might be worth your time but this is a waste of money
1,Outdated book is out of print: buy the new version!,"Since this book is outdated, don't waste your money.After the death of Pope John Paul II, his notes for the book were studied in his archives. There was a bad translation between lust and desire from Italian to English which makes a big difference. So buy the new one:""Male and female He created Them"""
1,Not a good NonStick Omelette Pan,"With nonstick pans, you should not spray oil on the surface b/c it could leave a residue, and isn't this why you bought a nonstick pan in the first place, so you could cook without the oil?This pan was not able to cook an egg on its non-stick surface. I used a little PAM and no problems, but I guess that's why the good non-stick costs more."
2,HOSTEL LIGHT,"The film is not as described. Dianna Argon, whose Snow White doll face adorns the cover is a minor chracter. Most of the film is preoccupied with building character, even the minor ones like a Dickens' novel. The main character is Chris Briant. He plays a new policeman and ex-army vet. There has been a rash of disappearances in the county. Briant suspects a fenced private hunting area known as Fort Gobin.He opts to go find out on his own and by this time you're asleep. The gory stuff is done off screen. This is not a teens going to the wrong place and being tortured type of movie. Fairly lame in slasher terms.F-bombs, no sex, no nudity, a homo-erotic dance."
2,Works but not sized for standard RJ45,The plastic RJ45 connector does not fit a standard female adaptor. The plastic seems to be too thick to fit correctly.
2,"Not terrible, but unspectacular","Randy Bachman's first jazz outing will probably satisfy fans of Diana Krall or Norah Jones, but should be avoided by most jazz aficionados. There's not much improvisation to speak of, and Bachman's vocals range from passable to unlistenable. Some of the tunes are actually quite nice (Our Leaves Are Green Again), but others fall into the usual trap encountered by jazz-dabblers of being songs about jazz rather than actual jazz (Breau's Place). Nice Johnny Cash cover, though (I Walk the Line)."
2,mediocre at best,there is a constant static in the background of the songs and also half the time doesn't work you have to unplug and plug back in a few times in order for it to work
1,Garbage,"This little tool is beyond useless. The blade is only mildly sharp, and does not screw in properly. No matter how much you tighten it, the blade wobbles loose during the shortest, simplest cutting job. Unsafe and unusable. Don't waste your time or money."
4,Almost perfect,"John Williams is by far my favorite composer in Hollywood and I really did enjoy this movie. So I guess I am basically as biased as one can get! I apologize in advance for that. This score is one of the great holiday scores of all time. The score is beautiful with moments of playfulness, surprise, and even a little creepiness (the opening little music box figure). However, I think it is absolutely necessary to comment on the songs on this album. I am not talking about the standard Christmas songs, although they do put you back into the movie when listening to them. I am referring to Williams' two masterpieces ""Star of Bethlehem"" and ""Somewhere in my Memory."" These are easily two of Williams' best songs and they both capture Christmas perfectly in their own unique way. This score has too much great music to be overlooked."
5,Texas-based band with Eastern-edge sound,"This rock band is one of the many from Texas that are working their way up the road to success. The lyrics of the songs, written by lead singer Joseph King, show much passion, desire, and emotion. This CD is beautifully compiled and is a favorite of mine."
2,Lackluster not worth the $$$,"CD 1 is pleasing while CD2 is unimaginative, dull and repetitious. This set lacks the layered depth, intensity, imagination and multidimension of Siddharta 1 and 3. Invest in sets like Sun and the Nirvana Lounge series by Claude Challe or the Chill Out in Paris series and Buddha Bar 2 and 4 of the Buddha Bar series to establish a truer comparitive baseline for what exquisite chill & dance/lounge music mixes should sound like...those sets you'll play forever and likely never get tired of them..."
3,Christmas music but not exactly what I was looking for...,"I ordered this and should have looked closer at the track listing. I was looking for the unique ""elf"" music behind the movie. What I got was the more ""standard"" music from the movie. If you are looking for the more traditional Christmas tunes, this is the disc to order. If you want the ""elf-unique"" tunes, order the other elf discElf. Still, I am happy with the item and will add it to my seasonal collection."
2,Not the soundtrack,"If you watched the movie and liked the music and thought you'd like the 'soundtrack' beware, these are not the same tracks as from the film."
5,A voice from 1940s heaven,"Can you believe that voice, I was never a real big fan (although I do like it) of the 40s genre music, but WOW I am now!!! I was completely amazed at the voice of that Zooey!!! I MUST have a CD with her singing ANYTHING. Not only is she cute but that girl can sing with the best of them, I now want to go buy a CD of the ""Rat Pack"" just to hold me over. We should have had the pleasure of her singing ""Santa Baby"" wouldn't that have been great.OH yeah the movie was really good too, one that we will soon own, mostly to hear Zooey crooning, but one that will entertain year after year. My ten year old boy even melted when he heard her voice!!"
4,missing song,"This CD is great, however they are missing a great Frank Sinatra tune? The song is You Make Me Feel So Young."
3,Elf soundtrack,"I love the movie Elf but I should have listened closer to the music while watching the movie. I thought I would love the soundtrack too but when some of the songs came on I thought, ""when was this song in the movie?"" I wasn't as impressed by the soundtrack as I was the movie."
5,Truly squirrel proof,A bit pricey but worth the money. A truly squirrle proof feeder that will last longer than ten of your usual home center feeders. I have two other Duncraft feeders which I purchased 15 years ago which are still in daily use.
4,Feeder,I live in the Pacific Northwest and with the winter rain this product could be better if it had a larger hood for better protection of the food. Other than that it is great.
5,Good Quality,"Everything you need. I like having a null modem cable not just an adapted. I've used this for several months now, and have had zero problems. I haven't noticed any speed issues either... what more are you looking for!"
5,Fibromyalgia and the Mind Body Spirit Connection,"I am 43 years old and I have Fibromyalgia. This book has challenged me to look at what my body and mind need to nourish my spirit. This book can help anyone who is accustomed to stress in everyday life. It will benefit anyone, not just those who have Fibromyalgia. I have bought three copys of this book; one was for myself and the other two were for gifts to people I love."
2,"Great, but WAAAAY Overpriced!","Great toy, my 4 year old neice loves it. However, you could buy it, the Minivan, and pay shipping direct from FisherPrice.com for less than what it is being listed here. Buyer beware!"
3,SUV Review,"Pretty good toy. Hard to get the people in and out of the SUV.Fun for children though, loves the noises it makes and the ease with which it rolls around for her."
2,bummed there wasn't the African music in this album,"I was looking for the African, middle eastern music from the movie. I am bummed they did not include it ! I am a bellydancer and LOVED the unique music, would love to know the names of the songs, our group wants to dance to them !If anyone knows the missing songs, please list them in a review, or give a web site link to find the other awesome missing songs. I hope the producers are reading this, count me as the first customer to buy the great ethnic music from this movie. Love 70's stuff, and it DID go with the great movie, but that is not why I was wanting this album.Stephy Twww.baladimomma.com"
4,two-fer,Album has long been my favorite Joan Jett album and I was happy to find it on CD. Glorious Results of a Misspent Youth was a little Bubble-gum-pop generic for my taste.
3,Simplified,"This is a great tool if you are headed to Mainland China. If you plan on coming to Taiwan you need to find something with traditional characters. Just like English, Chinese also has dialects. Mainland Chinese accent is much different from a Taiwan accent. I do, however recommend that you learn Hanyu Pin Yin. You'll be glad you did!"
4,Dictionary,Just finished a mini-course with the author of this dictionary. Very impressed with his thoroughness in really bringing it up to date and getting rid of older items which have become outdated. I highly recommend this dictionary if you need a concise pocket dictionary.
4,Castaway Christmas,"Set in Britain, this is book is about 3 children's struggle to survive a vicious flood that leaves them completely cut off and stranded in a large country home over Christmas. It is a fun read and teaches a lot about the importance of teamwork and helping those around you. I would definitely recommend it."
3,"Great films, but where's the sound?","Steam Train Legacy Two is another 3 DVD set from Marathon Music and Video featuring old short subjects on railroads. While the films were interesting, at least half of the films lacked narration, or even sound for that matter. While I understand that many of these films were silent to begin with, the producers could have at least put some canned train sound on there instead of that repetitive blugrass music! While there are a few bright spots (in paticular Southern Pacific's feature-length ""This is My Railroad""), all things considered I recommend the original over this boring collection."
1,Not worth your time!,I read Patterson's book based off this story. The book was great and well worth my time reading it. It is a very short book but I grew so fond of the charactors in the book I forgot for a mintue that they were not real.The movie could not have sucked more. I did not like any of the charactors. They did not follow the book very much. They did not build the charactors up like the book. It was a complete waste of my time.The ending was sad like the book but not as touching as the book. The build up sucked and I really had a hard time with the love part of it. The actors seemed to hate each other and there was no chemistry whatso ever between them.I could not have hated this movie any more than I did.
1,Poor Qualityh,"I am very disappointed in the quality of this bag. I have only used it for about 3 weeks, and the leather is cracking. One crack is so big that you can see the white lining underneath."
4,When you least expect it,"...this book will GET you!I read it, enjoyed it, wondered what in the world was going to happen. When it happened it took me completely by surprise. A haunting book that draws you in so skillfully you don't even realize what's going on."
3,Not her best but not bad,"This book is a pretty easy read. I give the author credit for her Civil War research but a reader should not take everything as fact. For instance, the author played it as fact that Abraham Lincoln had a acromegaly or gigantism, when it is actually believed but not confirmed that he may have had Marfan's Syndrome. From what I read, Marfan's can lead to acromegaly but it can also lead to scoliosis, flat feet and a plethora of other things. The big one was the way Robert E. Lee died. He did not die of a angina or a heart ailment nor did he say much when he died. He suffered a stroke that took away his speech and then died a month or so later of pneumonia. I think there was decent but not exactly accurate research. Others may say it's a book of fiction but there was no reason to change those two things for the story's sake. The author could have adjusted the Annie character to be warned of a stroke instead of a heart attack. Creative license was not needed."
3,Not a Love Story,"After reading ""Bellweather"" I was expecting much more from this book. I was very confused by an ending that did not successfully wrap up many of the ideas that were brought up throughout the story. Lincoln's dreams, Malachi's dreams, Annie's dreams, Traveler's dreams... I know that my dreams were much more vivid while I read it, but I was waiting and wanting so much more from the endless, and maybe that was the problem, possibilities in this book. I can appreciate the details of the battles and the violence of the Civil War, but calling this a ""love story"" is misleading. I would love to see a rewrite of this book since it read like an early draft."
4,Read Between the Lines,"Yes, this was Connie Willis' first book and though it could have been improved, she shows in this writing great things yet to come in her next novels.At first, I did not ""get"" this book. I thought it had little characterization and had a poorly developed plot. I wanted to yell, ""so what!""But then! I discovered it is not about the dreams of Annie and her life, it is about the life of Robert E. Lee and his dreams. Re-reading it, I discovered that the characterization of him and those around him are fully fleshed out, the Civil War told in extreme accuracy. This is what the book is about. His dreams are tied into the present day dreams of Annie who is somewhat linked to Lee's daughter, Annie, and then the whole scenario is linked then Lincoln himself. Confusing? Maybe, but good reading.Complicated time travel, if you want to call it that, but a pleasurable book and the ending gives it a really Twilight Zonish feel."
3,"Weird book, weak ending","Definately Connie Willis, but very early in the career. Thought provoking, interesting study of Civil War battles and dreams and the job of the research assistant. Unfortunately, the ending was weak. I felt that the book should have ended several chapters before it did. Willis seems to have commited a common mistake by trying too hard to tie up all the loose ends, and the story suffers because of it. Still, a very interesting and thought provoking novel."
1,Akbaraly Thobani,"If Akbarally Thobani is Akbarally Meherally, then the story is clear. This man eats his own vomit for quench of hunger and thirst. He is number one enemy of Islam and the Holy Qur'an. He is now more than 80 years old. He must be preparing to go to heaven and marry 72 virgins. for redering service to his Taliban like religion."
5,what a film,Gunner Palace really sets itself apart from other war movies in that it looks personally at the soldiers but is a documentary. I enjoyed watching a film about war with no political undertone. It is much better to let the audience determine their own opinion. Just a brilliant film!
3,just so-so,"if you want to see a bunch of gun battles and stuff getting blown up, this documentary isn't for you. If you want to see a bunch of people standing around in a blown up palace and doing boring raids then you hit the jackpot. Some of the scenes with the troops playing solo guitar got old after a while, dragged on for too long. I was looking forward to this for a while, but was disappointed.. boo"
1,A very very bad look on the war in Iraq,"Im not a vet to Iraqi 2 war, but i can tell u this movie pissed alot of soldiers off. I mean ALOT. Im going to Iraq sooner or later, but alot of soldiers who were vets cant stand to even discuss this movie.Boredom? Swimming pools? BBQs with girls? No shooting?Thats not how things are. Many soldiers had to live in tents, eat canned meat, watch their buddies get blown into pieces, and on their off time they could only sleep or eat.Granted some people might appreciate the artistic value of the camera man and director and all that, but this movie was made to show how war is to typical Americans, and now they have the wrong view."
2,No bargain even at $7.99,"Great orchestra and conductor come to nought in this reissue of ballet suites on Sony Classical.In Chopin's Les Sylphides the strings sometimes sound""edgy"", the venue dry.The Sylvia and Coppelia suites sound better, however,the inexplicable remix in Syliva remids one of the adage ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker is listenable but commands no interest beyond other mainstream recordings."
4,Truly Useful,"Although I purchased this book after graduating college (over six years ago, now), I still find it useful on a regular basis. I have been able to use this as a reference book again and again, not only when applying for jobs, but also when reviewing others' resumes for hiring purposes, and when updating my own. This resource is far more helpful than many other resume books out there. It does not just give a list of ""target"" words. It shows you layout, wording, phrasing, what to add on, what to omit. I highly recommend this for everyone needing to (re)create their resume, not just for first time writers!"
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed when I received this pamphlet... In the picture, they make it look like an actual book but when I received it, it was the size of a gift card... Definitely could do better for your money"
2,Contains Perfume,May state that it's hypoallergenic but it still contains a perfume that caused rashes on our infant. Confirmed with pediatrician that it was a skin rash and not baby acme. We switched to Cetaphil RestoraDerm body wash and the rashes quickly went away. Would not recommend for any sensitive skin infant.
5,man oh man...,"man oh man this is a hot read. i couldn't wait to pick up and i was not disappointed.... and that's an understatement. so hot it sizzles. loved ""the indignities of isabelle"" man oh man oh man....."
4,Love it!!,My son is 15 months old and received this toy for Christmas and the only thing that I do not like about it is that the legs keep falling off. I keep snapping them on and a little bit later they come off. He absolutely loves to play with the table though. He also got the farm set and the table has room enough to store all the pop on pieces. I love this toy for him!
3,Great Concept----With No Leg to Stand On,"My son got this for a gift and he loves it! However, the legs will not stay on. We actually had to superglue the legs on so that he could play with it. Other than that, it is a great toy. Hopefully the updated version will have better legs so that others will not have this happen to them."
5,Not Just For Hands,"I am 44 years old and am fighting all the typical age related issues one expects at this point in life. I bought the hand cream because I love Burt's Bees products and needed a moisturizer that was in a container small enough to meet the carry-on requirements for an airplane. I used it as an all-purpose moisturizer - yes on my hands, but also on my face. It was amazing. It made the skin so soft, and really did seem to make a difference with the fine lines. I now use it every night on both my hands and my face. I love it! And so much cheaper (and more effective) than some of the $100+ face creams out there that I have tried. Others have posted reviews saying how much they like the smell. I am not so keen on it. My son asked me the other night why I was putting play dough on my face. I'll be darned if that isn't EXACTLY what I think it smells like! The child nailed it! Not exactly my favorite scent."
5,Mmmmmmmm,"This is my most favorite body product I own. It smells so much like almonds/marzipan, which is my most favorite scent. And it works great at keeping my hands smooth & moisturized. I just love it."
3,allergic reaction,"OK, so it says it is for HANDS and it means it. It is a great product for adult hands. However my little toddler saw it and wanted to try it as ""makeup."" Her face immediately turned red and rashy (first time she ever had that reaction to anything). I called the company and they said that a reaction to the strong fragrance in this product is not unusual, especially in children.So if you have problems with fragrance, this might not be the product for you. Also don't use it on your kids."
2,Too much residue,"Pros: smells nice, nice texture while putting it on, leaves hands soft if you use overnight.Cons: does not absorb well into the skin, leaves a greasy residue so you can't touch anything for at least an half hour after applying itBottom line: I won't purchase this again, but I am using what I have left. It's a good product for night time treatment of dry and chapped hands (with gloves!)."
4,"Smells wonderful and is soothing, but a little greasy","The scent of this creme alone is worth purchasing it, in my book. I love naturally scented products, and this one smells nice without hitting you over the head with a baseball bat of manmade chemical perfumes. The creme is definitely soothing and terrific for dry skin on hands, elbows and even feet. I do find the creme to be a little more greasy than I normally like, but as long as you don't intend to use your computer immediately after applying the creme, you'll be fine. It absorbs into the skin in time, just not immediately as one might assume. Also, a little of this stuff goes a long way, so you get your money's worth."
3,Good storage if kept out of wind,"I bought one of these a few years back. I used it for storage on my roof deck. After owning it for two years I was looking out my 4th story window and noticed something large and green in the tree branches outside my window. To my horror it was the lid of the Rubbermaid unit - 4 stories up! The wind had ripped it off the unit and blown it into the tree about 60 feet away. I had to call the fire department to get the lid down out of the tree before it fell on someone.I still own the unit but am thinking of replacing it. After years on the roof deck the lid is warped and the hinges on the door were never very good. I have had the same issues as the other reveiwer where even before the lid was blown off the unit, the hinge doors would pop out and the whole unit would have to be out back together. All together I'm very disapointed in Rubbermaid on this one."
3,Could be better,"I am a little dissappointed with Bernstein's narration of Peter and the Wolf. I prefer the Disney rendition with Sterling Holloway. Bernstein didn't seem to put much drama into it, he sounded distracted and it just plain fell flat. The music was fine, and he did much better with The Carnival of Animals."
4,Very good set of trios,"While not up to the precedent of excellence set forth by Kempff, Szeryng and Fournier, this is still a very enjoyable set of Beethoven's piano trios. The artists involved had been friends for years and had always desired to record together, but one thing or another kept disrupting their endeavor until the mid-sixties when they finally got together. In addition to these recordings, they also did Brahms, Schubert and Mendelssohn, all quite satisfying. Another fine choice for these trios is by the Beaux Arts TrioBeethoven: The Piano Trios. Which ever one you choose, you won't regret it."
4,"Solid device, good software, but too many partitions","This external hard drive is one of the better constructed and visually appearing ones on the market. It is vented for heat reduction, has a soft blue glow, and since it is vertically mounted it does eat up desk space like a big brick (many competitors do.)I saw in another review that the FAT32 format was a welcomed feature for MAC users and it should also help for those older operating system like Win98. Due to size limitation you end up splitting the 250GB into 32GB chunks. All of those partitions are a pain and uses up drive letters that in a corporate office are needed for drive mappings. Unfortunately, if you blow these away and make a large NTFS partition, the Retrospect software no longer works. I have not found a way around this yet."
3,timer,"Cool design and I'm sure it's just fine, but not quite what I thought. The knob is a lot larger than the picture shows, at least twice the size shown. Not for me."
3,Disappointed in one of two purchased,"We owned one that eventually disintegrated. Bought two more. The first one [used on a cold grill] fell apart after two uses. So far, the second one is doing OK [about 3 uses].Bought Brookstone's battery-powered grill brush for a Father's Day present. With replaceable heads at $4 each, it seems like a great idea - and had 24 rave reviews [out of 25]."
5,Truly inspiring,"Ms. Mattern is a true hero. Her story has given me a new perspective on living. In the face of death, she saw life. I can only pray that I would possess half the courage she had while fighting cancer if ever I find myself in a similar situation. Her book will leave you with a whirlwind of emotions; I laughed and cried. The book is a beautiful composition of an amazing woman's will to live. Her family and friends were her backbone, never letting her fall. I highly recommend this book; it's a must-read for all."
2,Too many bugs,"This could be a very good game, if not for all the bugs that make gameplay downright frustrating at times (particularly in galactic conquest mode). I would not recommend purchasing this game until Lucasarts comes out with a patch."
5,good belt,"the belt arrived on time and fit the way it is supposed to.Nice and quite with no issues,like it should be."
2,delivery was late,"I never received any confirmation that my item was shipped and and only did when I inquired weeks later about it. The item was delivered September 17th, 3 days later than the estimated September 14th deadline (I made the purchase on August 20th). This was unacceptable as I received my other items within a week of my purchase. I rate it two stars only because of the price and the condition of the book - it looked new!"
5,First of a long series-- I hope...,"It is my sincere hope that this is only the first volume of a large procession of such sets of the classic show-- and unlike one of the other reviewers, while I certainly love (and will buy, given the chance) the later shows, I wouldn't trade them for the earlier ones that really show its development. The whole experience I get out of these shows is the charm, innocence and nostalgia of an earlier, simpler time. I've had the 10 volume VHS set for some time, and love them dearly. Sign me up for a complete subscription of as many of these DVDs they're willing to produce..."
1,Wrong Color,"I have a new baby boy....and you don't get to choose the color!! Of course they sent me 4 pink nuks....why wouldn't they just send everybody a neutral color, or at least let us choose?"
5,I came from a war,"Ok, first all these people that are writing comments probably are from Bosnia but lived throughout the war in another country. I am from Prijedor,Bosnia and i know exactly how a war is like because i've seen it and i know how it is. This movie cannot be better it is 110% reality and cannot be better. Maybe there are a few clips they added in but that probably was true also. I do not understand why the creater of the Movie didnt get an Oscar. If you watch this movie and you are from BOSNIA, you will cry and know exactly how it was. The way they killed Muslims was true (hammer on the head...., cut ear out...rape....etc) I just have to say that this movie is the best and cannot be any more better. By this messege i do not attend to hurt anybodys feelings...I am just sharing my opinion to this movie that its very real and no other Bosnian War movie or how you want to call it is better."
4,Stick with this past the first 15 minutes,"This film improves immeasurably once it gets past the rather clunky, far-fetched scenes that explain how Quaid's character ends up in Bosnia. It depicts (for once) Serbs, Bosnians, and Croats as equal victims and perpetrators of the 1991-95 war, rather than blaming the evil Serbs for everything per orders of NATO and the Soros Foundation. If that sounds like ""Serbian propaganda"" to you, buy Behind Enemy Lines instead; Savior will not satisfy your simple-minded action film fix."
1,Mostly one sided and misleading,"The movie, in my opinion, is propaganda against Muslims. I am a Muslim from Bosnia and I believe the movie made by a Serb is completely favoring the Serbs. One part especially disturbing to me was the rape of the Serb woman by Muslims. Anyone who knows anything about the conflict knows that it was the Serbs who used rape as a weapon of war in their ethnic cleansing of Muslims. Ofcourse the Muslims are not without blame but the entire movie seems to switch the roles of the Serbs and Muslims. For someone who doesn't know about Bosnia and what happened this movie could completely give them the wrong message. Until the Serbs stop making propagandist movies such as this and admit to themselves and their victims what they did and why there will never be peace in the Balkans."
1,Missleading and Incorrect,"This movie is entirely fictional and is NOT based on true events. First of all, the great 'Saviors' family was killed by muslims, and so he chooses to go killing some muslims in a completely different country. That in in itself shows that the director hates muslims and limits all muslims to being 'bad'. The other thing is the way that he portraied Bosnian-Muslims; main causes/killers of the war, which is a complete lie. The serbs goal was to eliminate the whole Bosnian-Muslim population and create a dominant ethinc group; the serbs ofcourse. Also he forgot to mention the attack on Srebrenica where serbs killed over 8000 civillians in just one day...I just have to asume that the director LOATHES all muslims as he completely LIED."
3,Okay,"bought it for my dad he liked it for like 10 min and found it little boring after that, i dont know i havent played it so i would guess it's okay"
5,The Story of the World:History for the Classical Child:The Modern Age: Tests and Answer Key (vol.4),"We are very satisfied with our purchase. Story of the World books provide an easy to understand, chronological view of History. We love them! The test booklet works well to check our 8th grader's understanding of her reading."
3,and now for something completely different...,"To be honest we are only ten chapters in to this volume (having read the previous three volumes), but this volume seems very choppy and disconnected. She does put a disclaimer at the beginning of the book stating the older age (fourth grade to eighth grade) of her intended audience, however the ""storytelling"" style of the previous volumes seems to be missing; that, in addition to the seemingly unrelated topics in each chapter make this book a much more difficult read, and certainly a more difficult ""follow."" We are hoping that the Activity Guide will make it more cohesive, however, it has not yet been released, which is very frustrating. Not giving up yet, however, as this has been a very good series overall."
5,Great books to read out loud!,My husband is a history professor and he read these books to our oldest daughter. He thinks these books are a great introduction for kids to world history. He loves them and is now reading them to our little one.
2,what will you use this for?,"I bought this for shooting some little news shows with schoolkids. With no mic input, it's useless. It has it's own proprietary outputs, so your existing cables will be useless. Picture is like all the rest. Didn't work for us, but if you're looking for a basic, easy, all-auto camera that gives you no control whatsoever over the image, you'll love this one."
1,The Worst,This is the worst product I have ever bought. I wanted something simple...it wasn't; I wanted to listen to the radio; I couldn't. I didn't even try the dvd player. Every radio station I tried could not be found. It would play the same station even hand tuning to another station. This is junk.
3,Alison Balter's Mastering Microsoft Office Access 2003,"comes with a fairly good cd that ends part way through what would have been a good primer, with a lead-in to purchase a rather expensive follow-on. disappointing"
3,New Title / Same Material,"I have found Alison Balter's work to be of great benefit and highly helpful in the past. However this book has very little new material compared to Alison Balter's Mastering Access 2002 Desktop Development (With CD-ROM). Besides the title and cover design little else has changed. If you don't have a previous edition in the Mastering Access series this is a good book, if you do have one you will find little new material here."
2,Not as good as most Wies\Hickman books.,"This book just wasn't the same calibur as the Chronicles trilogy. It didn't have the descriptiveness or the complex characters. Sturm having a child with Kitiara would never happen, and if it did sturm would beg forgiveness to Paladine and commit suicide. If you are looking for another great weis\hickman book don't bye this. Bye Legends or Dragons of Summer Flame."
3,dumb two stories,"I didn't like the last story. Gilthas seems to be a kind of idiotic senseless non-curious ignorant little brat. For the sake of future stories, I won't expand on how stupid. I liked all the stories, but I felt a little disappointed about the difficulty of the Test in the Legacy. It just didn't seem quite as life-threatening as Raistlin's Test. Supposedly Palin is as talented as Raistlin."
1,DOESN'T WORK!,"Does not work as advertised. After struggling to get the disks under the corners of my furniture, still had to push hard and struggle to make the furniture move - only to have the disks displace. AVOID this product. Don't know why it's still on the market."
4,Our Identity is Indeed in Christ,"Anderson writes very plainly and passionately who we as Christians are in Christ Jesus. In order to have ""Victory Over the Darkness"", we NEED to know who we are in Christ. I like the fact that Anderson doesn't proof-text Scripture, coming up with his own ideas of what the Bible says, but rather spends a significant portion of several chapters listing specific Scriptures that clearly identify our wonderful identity in Christ.A very worthwhile book."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY !,"STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS SCISSOR CUTS ..............IT SURELY IS NOT POULTRY, OR MEAT OR FISH................I WILL HAVE TO TRY IT ON PAPER BUT THEN I DIDN'T NEED ANOTHER PAPER SCISSOR !!!!!!"
4,Hilarious !,"It try to keep my review short.The crime story is average, the recipes started my mouth to water but the main plot it simply hilarious. The two main protagonists, Carolyn Blue, wife of a university professor and author of a food column and Luz Vallejo, retired cop, who couldn't be more different.The story is told alternatively by Carolyn and Luz and as funny as can be.I ordered the remaining books written by Nancy immediately."
5,Great,A great shifter but is to long. It is hitting my dash and was put in as close to my as I could.
1,the good and the bad,"The music is all there, but the recordings are terrible. If this is remastered it need to re-remastered or just left as it was."
1,Shut up,"FYI, Bratz are more prettier than My Scene dolls, and maybe Bratz don't look like real poeple, but people like that better. I mean no one wants a doll that looks like everyone else. And Bratz dolls are better and prettier than My Scene dolls in ever collection. And the Bratz don't have big heads. I mean look at the My Scene dolls. Their heads are pretty big too, and so are their feet and lips. So why are you saying mean things about Bratz huh? Bratz are better and prettier in ever collection than My Scene dolls. You just don't know anything about beauty and fashion. And people don't like Barbie dolls that much anymore. And we don't care if the Bratz clothes don't fit Barbie dolls. We don't like Barbie dolls that much anymore. And The reason why My Scene dolls are so cheap is because if they were expensive and you bought one, it would have been a waste of money. That is why Bratz are more expensive than my scene dolls"
2,And the award for worst vocalist of the year goes to...,"If I could I would give the music a 5 star rating, cause it really is quite dazzling. However, the singer manages to take any bit of life out of the music by growling in what is the worst excuse for singing I have EVER heard...yea it even makes the lead singer of Smashing Pumpkins sound like Lennon or McCartney. Anyway, just alot of loud noise and filler aimed at pleasing 12-16 year old males with angst issues."
4,"Grand, glorious, spectacular metal","If you think like me, then you must think that Coal Chamber can't be beat as far as Goth-Metal goes. And you're right. That's one of the many reasons that I love Devildriver. Dez Farvara from Coal Chamber decided to go in a completely new, harder direction for music....and I love it. I was very scared and sceptical when finding out that Dez had started a new band, but overjoyed when I heard them. Their sound is brutally hard, fast, and angry. I was blessed with the chance to hang out with Dez after an amazing show recently, and he seemed a lot happier and at peace that he did with Coal Chamber. Now, don't get me wrong, I hope CC doesn't break up, but I am a full supporter of Devildriver, and I hope they gain their much deserved success. If you are a metal fan, go and spend money on amazing bands like these guys and Superjoint Ritual, and Entombed....you'll thank yourself later....and perhaps me."
5,Great overview,"Great overview of the latest scholarship as well as the foundational and primary source material of the Bible and literature on early Eucharistic meals. All of this research is woven through with theological reflection using a narrative methodology which is readily accessible to scholar, pastor and laity."
5,"In my ""MEMRY""","Forever in my""memry"" will be the song of Grizabella the Glamor Cat MEMRY first from the sound recording. Usually I'm not a ""cat person"". I'm really a ""dog person"". But I found the poems based on T.S. Elliot cute and intriguing. Later when I bought a DVD of the production I was, at first, slightly put off by the nitty-gritty costumes and highly worked ballet dances. I suppose only the ""cat persons"" would fully understand and appreciate the poems about varous kinds of cats but I found them highly amusing, more so in the sound recording than in seeing the actual visual production. Will there ever be a DOGS?"
1,Disappointed,"I thought I had ordered the one with the actors as cats, but this was just music. i didn't discover until I had played it, and after reading your return policy on opened merchandise, I kept it because I did not want to take the loss of money in reurning it to you."
1,Absolutely worthless!,"Such a shame, I loved this idea. The metal blades on this item bent the first time I used it. I was even trying to saw carefully as other feedback recommended. I tried to use it twice and it was so bad that I actually threw it in the garbage after having it less than a week!"
1,Don't buy this slicer!,"This slicer is based on a great conceptual design, but poorly manufactured. The backs of the saw blades (which you must touch) are razor sharp! It is unusable as far as I am concerned!"
3,A wonderful tart if you miss the taste of Philly with wit.,"Having read every Amanda Pepper book, I really must recuse myself from any serious attempt at a critical response to The Bluest Blood. I would prefer if Amanda stayed in the city. The Main Line is only interesting if you can afford to live there. Go back to Atlantic City if you want to leave town. This story is so ridiculous that it feels like the author just had to meet a deadline. That does not mean I didn't enjoy it. Though I prefer having Mr. MacKenzie around for more of the story. The thoughts and conversations, and the writer's extremely accurate and witty take of life in America, Philly in particular, is what makes this entire series so valuable. And if you are a relocated Philadelphian, this is a very inexpensive way to visit home, and not drip steak juice on yourself."
2,All's well that ends well--- and this one didn't!!,"The blurbs on this book praised the author's witty style, but I didn't find she delivered on that count or any other. This book was an average read that kept me just interested enough to continue until I reached the denouement, when I bailed out. Unfortunately, the end of this book is so stupid that I put the book down with only 15 pages left. Three of the main characters are trapped in a situation where they run around and take heroic measures to escape. They exclaim that there is no phone. However, one of them is a computer nerd, and he has been working on a computer in the room where they are trapped, hooked to the Internet. Anyone with half a brain would get on-line and call for help. Any editor or author with half a brain would have seen this glaring weakness and corrected it before the book was published! I don't think I'll rush to read Ms. Roberts' next product."
5,Amazing gizmo,"This is truly an amazing kitchen gadget. I love to cook, but never quite mastered separating the egg thing. With this I simply crack the egg on the supplied metal ridge, drop the egg into the cup, shake it around a bit, and voila... perfectly separated eggs!"
5,Truly Beautiful Collector Doll,"Having been a Barbie Doll Collector for 10 years now, I cannot imagine anyone seeing this doll and not believing that finally Mattel has gone back to the roots of feminine beauty in its purest form. She doesn't have the glamour of Mackie's Goddess of the Arctic or the sexy Diva Collection.... but what this doll does have is a sense of innocence and a hauntingly angelic face. The photographs simply do not do her proper justice. I purchased 2 after I personally saw her: the face of an angel, the wonderfully feminine gown, and gorgeous deep brown hair make her worth purchasing"
4,A Simplistic Idea Brilliantly Executed,"A comic love story documentary that worked out wonderfully by chance. Berkowitz is random, hilarious and extremely creative. Has the elements of a movie that will keep you interested...a conflict (or two), a character with a tragic flaw (or two), lots of experimental footage, and a lot of twists at the end."
1,staged and stupid,"Berkowitz loses our trust early in the film and never regains it. Immediately you realize that this movie is staged and what results is just bad writing and bad acting. On his dates Berkowitz nevers says anything charming or intersteing. On one date, one woman is offended to learn she's being photographed with a hidden camera. She wounds Berkowitz's hand which he says required stitches. We never seen the hand wound or the stitches. Each date is so fabricated and staged. I felt insulted and cheated. He must think his audience is stupid to think that these dates are real."
2,"fake, though sometimes funny","Well scripted at times, and a clever premise, but Berkowitz is too much the low-rent Woody Allen to pull this off: full of himself, and full of s***. Dont believe the hype, either. No way is this a real documentary. (Elie Samaha is Syrian Jewish, for one thing, and not nearly that articulate.)"
1,I hate My Scene dolls,i hate My Scene dolls. Bratz dolls are totally better. They are prettier and more fashionable than My Scene dolls. Don't get this doll. She is too ugly. Bratz are better. Bratz Rule.
3,An interesting read,"I've seen Jan speak in person and she's very inspiring. I have plenty of fools in my life and wanted to read more on the subject. Unfortunately, there are no easy answers in this book but she does make it clear that we can't change our fools. We can detach; we can change our reactions but it's still a journey each of us has to travel."
3,enjoyable...,"Its very entertaining, the characters hot!!! And I wanted to know more about them. A good read from Jill Shalvis."
2,Just not good enough,I love romance novels and am always happy to stumble across a new author. This is the first of her novels I've read and I was disappointed. It had a good plot and could have been better. Was cheesy at times and I found myself rolling my eyes.
3,front focusing,"Update: I received another lens & this one is good. I have it combined with my E-3. It still does not focus properly on my E-500. Don't know why but it is great on the E-3 & I'm glad I got the exchange. We have so few wide primes to choose from.I happened to get a bad copy of this lens. It front focused very badly. I am sending it back to Amazon for a full refund after going around with the customer service rep, he finally did the right thing even though it is past the 60 day return because I really want an exchange. I hope to order another & get a good copy. The few times I got spot on focus by luck, it was very crisp. Hope to get a good copy next time. The focal length is great for indoors."
3,"Oops, keep looking elsewhere!","I have a good experience with Sigma lens: 10-20mm and 18-50/F2.8, but this lens did not impress me at all. May be it is not focusing correctly, the image was not sharp at all below f2.8, even at 2.8 was not good enough(3 stops down). CA is also prominent off the center. My nikkor 50mm/F1.8 (1/3 of the price) will beat it hands down in sharpness and CA at f1.8, even Sigma 18-50mm @F2.8 zoom lens will beat it. What is the point in this lens then? Just to say - you have a prime lens? For $26 more you can get outstanding Sigma 18-50/F2.8 that would outperform it in every department. May be I just got a bad sample, but I decided to return it. If you are D40,D40x or 60 owner - there is no other choices currently. Lets hope Nikon will introduce AF-S, but the chances are not good."
3,Nothing more than what it is! Fast.,"Yes, this is a fast lens, and that's terrific. But it's clunky feeling, which may seem silly but has something to do with it's awkward size and shape when shooting. It also didn't come across as very sharp. I'm sure it passes some kind of resolution test for competence, but the pictures lacked ""snap"" and that's a subjective response only. I like a lot of Sigma lenses but often discover that snappy look more in Nikon lenses--it might be sharpness, or it might be contrast (the MTF charts are still a mystery to me). But call this is heads-up warning to people thinking about the lens in any kind of professional or demanding hands. Sadly, there isn't an affordable option. (This lens is optically the same for Nikon, Canon, and 4/3 mounts.)"
2,Disappointment,"Photography is a serious hobby of mine, for more than 20 years. I own the lens for six months or so, and I am sorry to say - don't like it.Perhaps I received a defective lens, but I keep getting poorly focused photos out of my Nikon D70 with this lens.I must say this was a big surprise for me, build and materials are high quality, it has a nice feeling all over, I owned another Sigma lens (which I really liked - see later) but these focus issues just made me leave the lens at home. I have a moderate collection of other Nikon compatible lenses, all but two are Nikon, the two others are Sigma lenses - this one and a 10-20mm DX zoom (which I love).I also have a Nikon 35mm f/2 lens, which I had for three years or so before I purchased the Sigma 30mm f/1.4, I thought the somewhat wider angle, significantly wider apperture, and HSM AF would be great - they look great on paper, but... Nowdays my main two everyday lenses are the 10-20mm Sigma, and the 35mm f/2 Nikon."
2,not impressed by optical performance,"An easy way to check how this lens work in the field is to browse through the pBase camera database. I was disapointed on the lens I received, and only comforted by those pictures at pBase that I didn't receive a particular lemon.I am feeling my D70 have difficulty focusing with this lens sometimes, can't really tell who's fault though.As to the warranty issue, FWIW a vendor I talked to also have the 1 year warranty, and he said the extended warranty was $10 more."
3,Dreaming of a Nikon AF-S 35mm F2 but had to buy this...,"This lens is a funny mix - wonderful centre performance and awful edges. OOF areas look terrible if the backround is busy; smeared not blurred and with obvious CAs, although the latter is typical of f1.4 glass. My Nikon AF-S 12-24 is MUCH better but it is limited to f4. Even my 18-200mm gives a more even resolution across the frame at 18mm and f3.5.So I use this lens knowing I will probably need to crop images by up to 70% of the original to get a good result.I don't have any focus or exposures issues on my D40X.As soon as Nikon get their act together with AF-S primes, such as an AF-S 28mm F1.4, I'll be selling this on Ebay for a fraction of what I paid for it. In the meantime, it does the job."
3,Nice lens (if you are lucky enough),"This is not and L lens, but it is pretty good for the money. I was looking for a prime lens for my crop sensor DSLR equivalent to a 50mm on a full frame camera, this Sigma lens was the perfect combination of price, quality and aperture (open wide at f1.4 you will get awesome bokeh). The main (huge)problem with this lens is, as many said before, its front focus issues. I had to go through 4 copies of this lens (from Amazon and B&H) before I got one that didn't have this problem. Some cameras can be adjusted to correct this issue, if you are willing to do this or to use only manual focus (most likely for video) you probably wouldn't mind if you get a bad copy. For people like me that use AF a lot and crave shallow DOF, then be very patient and get ready to send back some of these until you get a good copy."
4,Good low light digital lens at great price.,"About 1300.00 cheaper than the Nikon 28mm f1.4 lens. For the price this low light lens does well, capturing sharp images.My only concern is that other dealers list this lens as having a total of 5 yrs warranty (1 international, 4 USA). There is NO mention of USA warranty with the lens I received. I contacted Amazon about this but have received no reply to date. Thus I question whether the lens I received was so-called grey market, which is disconcerting seeing I could have gotten same lens elsewhere with full warranty. This is something to be aware of - hopefully Amazon will respond to me.UPDATE::::5/4/06 - Amazon is listed as a authorized dealer on the Sigma site so I assume Sigma lenses sold by Amazon have the USA warranty (4 years)."
4,Excellent alternative to what Nikon doesn't even have.,"This is an excellent lens with very sharp optics. Bokeh is matter of personal taste but, I have that I really like the bokeh from this lens. Besides the cons I've written, I like everything about this lens:Cons:can used only in cropped sensor camera.Min aperture is f16. Sometimes I want f22It doesn't focus fast as some of my AF-S (pro level) lensUntil Nikon comes out with fast WA, I guess I will be using this one for while."
4,Stunning Live Cuban Piano Music,"Ignacio ""Nachito"" Herrera was raised in Cuba and was fortunate to receive the guidance of many of Cuba's top pianists, including the late Ruben Gonzalez of Buena Vista fame, before growing up to join the acclaimed Cubanismo! Band which toured the world. The influence is evident in his stylings on this live album - he takes an idea and floats it up the scales, he pounds and bounces when he wants to be forceful, and he skips across the keyboard when he wants to be playful. The arrangements are fresh, the rhythms engaging, and the band lively. I recommend Spain in the Twins (tk 2) for its powerful tempo and feel changes, Danzon para Aurora (tk 7) for its classic Cuban feel, and Speak No Evil (tk 3) for a Latin take on a Wayne Shorter standard. Track 8 is slow, with drawn out vocals and Track 1 is just an intro, but otherwise, you can't go wrong here."
2,Really its SMALL !!,I just bought this ornament for my 20 gallon fish tank stated as MEDIUM and is much smaller than expected.It's just a little bigger than my fist.Pretty disappointed by its size
4,Great additon to 55 gal tank,I bought this for my large tank and it is a great way to add some hiding areas for smaller fish and create some realness to the environment. It cleans easily and arrived promptly from the supplier.
4,Great camcorder depending on what you want to do with it.,"I just got this camera the other day. And so far, I'm in love with it. I am a photographer and a video artist, and I had a nicer Sony camera that broke, and I was seeking out a replacement. The DCR-HC36 has a much lower quality image than my old camera, however its exactly what i've been looking for. Small, portable, and grainy. I still would like to get a nicer video camera to replace the old one. But I think that this camera is what the Holga is when talking about medium format film cameras. It has its charm and you definatly get a certain look to what you record.This camera seems like it would be good for someone who just wants to film their kids or family events. However, if you want something with better image quality, spend the money and take a step up. However, i would also recomend this camera for a video production student, its got plenty of manual features and the 20x optical zoom is great."
3,"OK, but not great","The magnification is about what you get from reading glasses at WalMart. The benefit is the clip-on aspect. I work on computers and, occasionally, need to see something better with my hands free. So, I clip-on these glasses and it helps. Just wish they were a little more powerful."
4,Works For Me,"These clip on your own glasses easily, and they flip up and out of the way easily so you don't have to remove them if you want to walk over to get a cup of coffee or look out the window. I wish they were a bit stronger in magnification, but they are a good product at a great price."
1,KIDS TOY ?,"My mistake in thinking a MiniDV Camcorder used MiniDV TAPE to record on.After discovering my mistake, I packed it up to ship back without trying it. Now I'll wait for Amazon to credit my card. I did ship it at my expense as I thought Amazon had done their part in a fast excellent manner so I did'nt think they should pay to return my goof !"
2,Motor noise problem,"I bought this camera thinking it was a great valu for the price, but when you record anything (interior and exterior) you are recording all the motor noise from the camera's mechanical system.I try to reduce the noise by editing, with pinnacle, and that work if nobody is speaking.The image quality is good, the camera look great and is tiny, you can carry it very easy.I don't recommend this camcorder, spend a few bucks more and get another brand"
1,Horrible Camera - Stopped Working After 3 Months,"A longtime Samsung supporter, I had high hopes and was hopeful that for $300 (at the time) this would be my light use, family event camcorder for the next 5-7 years. NO CHANCE. this camera stopped working suddenly and without warning after only 3 months and perhaps 3 total hours of use (how convenient that Samsung's warranty expires at exactly 3/months!) After contacting Customer Service, I was informed that I could send the camera to their service center in New Jersey where it would be repaired and returned for the flat fee of $161.15. Two downsides for me are (1) The camera is now $190 (+/-) brand new, and, (2) The warranty on repairs is only for a whopping 30 days. New plan, grab some small screwdrivers and start tinkering, meanwhile I'm here to pick up a new Sony, Cannon, or Panasonic and strongly advise anyone reading this review or considering this camera to quickly DO THE SAME!"
1,Wonderful until it self-destructed in flames,"I loved the description of this microwave kettle, bought it, used it frequently and very happily for several months, and then -- at 2am, while heating water for some hot chocolate -- I smelled something acrid and turned to find flames inside the microwave. After cutting off the power and examining both the kettle and oven, it was clear that something had burned a hole clear through the kettle lid. There were no signs of malfunction in the oven, but it was coated with thick, black soot, and the terrible smell lingered in my kitchen for several days. Before this I would have rated the kettle a full 5. Beware! Should not be on the market."
3,Works very well but read about safety issues,"I bought this item at a retail store, and I have to say it works quite well. It whistles in the microwave if you leave it long enough. The outside gets mildly warm but will not burn. So all-in-all it functions as I expected.With the recent news on the safety of various plastic components though, I did a check on the underside of this item and the recycle code indicates it is made from polycarbonate which according to Consumer Reports can release bisphenol A into water when heated. Depending on what you believe regarding safety of this compound, you can make a choice. As for me, I am boiling my water in my tea kettle (stainless steel, not aluminum!)"
1,If looking for FICTION this would do,"The book claims to take much of it's history straight from the scriptures yet there are so many things that are mentioned that are untrue and misleading. There are many facts of important people in the past such as the first world leader, Nimrod, that shaped all the beliefs of every culture mentioned in the book except the HEBREWS and there are no mentions at all. I would not spend what many are selling this book for. It isn't work the money."
5,A Solid Start and Finish for Each Day,"I received this book as a Christmas present from my husband , and we both have thoroughly enjoyed it. Though each entry is brief, they are rich in spiritual truth. Spurgeon's genuine passion for the Lord shines on every page and truly encourages me towards a deeper love of Christ. The editing and updating is masterfully executed, leaving you with an enjoyable, easy read without losing the historical feel you would expect when reading Spurgeon. I would highly recommend this book."
2,Not Happy with the so-called formatting.,"I purchased this mostly on the product description. It is not as it is claimed ""perfectly"" formatted for the Kindle. There are no paragraphs and the links from morning to evening don't work (at least for me). The pages look a mess and while the content is supposed to be the appeal I think it is very poorly formatted. If I could get a refund I would."
5,Always Refreshing Im so thankful for this book!!!!!!!,"This book has encouraged me time and time again. It has changed my perspective on trials with the solid biblical truths taught and explained. Spurgeon is a very wise man and was blessed with many gifts. His continues to speak through his timeless writings long after his death and the daily readings will help you...will bless you. Thank you God for this man! The updated version by Alistair Begg is preferable to me n ease of reading however you can never go wrong with C H Spurgeon. I also highly recommend ""Comfort for the Soul"" ; select writings from Spurgeon by Ray Comfort. A great little book to keep by your bedside."
1,It sux,"This book sucks, HARD. After a few chapters i burned it. Can you find a crapier title. There is only one good thing about this book is it burns nice and toasty."
1,Slices are too thin,"This slicer would be great, except it has a fatal flaw. The slices are far too thin, they are actually translucent."
1,MADE IN CHINA,"This is not made in Italy like the product description says. It's made in China. Figures I'd spend an hour on here researching graters, spend $10 to specifically get one made somewhere other than China and get this piece of crap."
2,grater,"The grater works fine, however, it bits of whatever you grate get stuck between the plastic handle and the grater. It is hard to clean."
2,it works...just not so well,The holes in this grater are set too far apart and make it very difficult to grate something as simple as a carrot. It gets the job done...eventually but it's definately not easy. No real complaints for the cheese grating quality though...it seems to work ok for that area.
3,Brief comments in the book!,Quickly what is to be said about that book is that it is mainly addressed to people with some experience in the field and not to newcomers. well structured deals in good detail with all aspects of organizing your HVAC systems operation and maintenace. Gives good guidelines for people that are not sure if they want to run the equipment themselfs or outsource the operation. It helped me a lot deciding to outsource the operation of our steam plant. I would generally recommend it as a good reference for the evereday problems that HVAC equipment runs into and for the organization of your maintenace of your equipment. It could though deal in greater depth with the aspects of HVAC equipment design and installation.
3,still havent recieved item,"i love anything disney and was super excited to get this pluto set. well, its been almost a month and i still havent recieved my item. amazon themselves is great but the seller WPG sent out the product the cheapest way possible which in end, according to the post office has the least priority so who knows when i will get this product. As of today, the last scan was in peabody mass on the 10th of july... its aug 4 now. $2.98 is the standard shipping cost...thats what i paid but according to the post office, the seller sent it out for 19 cents. Buy this dvd if you love Pluto or Disney...just wouldnt recommend you to buy from seller WPG. i just hope the set is worth the wait..."
3,No Sarah Brightman,"I came over here to listen to Kathleen Battle after reading a couple of stuffed shirts put down Sarah Brightman, suggesting that Battle was the real thing. Unfortunately they were right. God, that operatic stuff is awful. I love Baroque, and Wynton Marsalis is like a cut and polished stone. But operatic singing is like the combination of a wet, soapy dishrag and fingernails on a chalkboard all rolled into one memorable package. ""Serious"" music is only silly if it doesn't touch your soul. If it doesn't make your breast heave, expand and amaze, or have that animal throb then what is the point? I do concede that some people actually like opera, though I can't possibly imagine how! Must be an acquired taste, like castor oil or something. For those folks then Kathleen Battle must be the real jungle juice. But in my not so humble opinion, Sarah Brightman is an angel..."
4,Thermocouple,Bought as a backup...hence the 4 star rating...hopefully it works when the time comes good buy for some insurance la la la
4,NICE TIDBITS OF HISTORY IN THE TROPICS,"The tropics have always fascinated European explorers with tales of monsters and incredible nature. In this book, the authors tell the stories of a few handpicked explorers of the tropics.The stories are divided among continents:1. In South America, we have Orellana (first man down the Amazon), Aguirre (insane explorer in the Amazon), Raleigh (Brit up in Guyana) and Condamine (the French measurer of the Earth).2. In Africa, Livingstone, Burton, Speke, Conrad, among others.3. In Asia, Magellan (first around the world), Stevenson (of literary fame), and Brooke (the white Raja).These are just short stories, of maybe 5-15 pages per explorer, and the choice of explorers is not necessarily the best, given the limited space in the book."
1,Very bad Expression,"This is against qatari people and their culture or thier relegion, I belive that this sign must not be sold."
3,"Walt Disney Treasures - Mickey Mouse in Black and White, Volume Two by",great item. thank you for the timely manner in which it was received
4,Fits great anywhere,I purchased this product because I have limited space on my closet and this one fits perfectly because I can adjust to the desired length.
2,Shoes fall off the rack,This rack has not worked well for me. I wear a size 7 and none of my shoes are long enough for this rack. The bars are too far apart and all of my shoes fall in between the bars. My husband also tried to use it and his shoes would slip off of the bars as well. I gave it 2 starts because it seems sturdy.
2,Femi Kuti,"A low budget documentary of an unknown musician, who thinks very highly of himself. Rent it or borrow it, but don't purchase it."
4,saab 9-3 drive belt,"I purchased this dayco poly-rib belt for our 1999 Saab 9-3 vehicle. I picked this belt for the quality as it is a bit more pricey than others but rated better. So far, it has held up well. I recommend 2 people installing this belt on a 9-3 as it is one of the more difficult drive belts I have done. One trick is to make sure the belt is centered well in all of the lower pulleys and also on the idler pulley but just off the upper left-hand pulley before pulling on the tensioner. While one person is pulling the other person can slip on the belt and make sure the belt is centered on all pulleys. This seemed to work the best for me."
2,Advanced Sheet Metal Fabrication,"This book consists of lots of pictures of very experienced technicians using very expensive tools to create impressive pieces/projects. Given that, I suppose the title is accurate. What I was looking for was a more in-depth discussion of metal properties and forming techniques more suited to the home/garage shop. I will say that the book does have some helpful hints useful to the home enthusiast but it leans more toward the multi-thousand dollar power hammers, wheels and shrinker/stretchers."
1,Broke first time I used it,The wheel with the blade broke off the first time I used it. Unfortunately I didn't use it until 4 days after my 'return window' at Amazon expired.
3,"Good, simple can opener for the price","I appreciate that this can opener was made in Italy, and not the typical made in China like everthing else on the market. The opener is lightweight and does the job. It performs well but I personally would prefer a heavier and more substantial feel in a manual can opener. However, it does perform better than the OXO I bought at three times the price, which started failing on me a month after I bought it. This can opener is a good price and would make an excellent backup or something to leave at work."
1,Don't waster your money,"If you're an artist you won't get anything from this book and if you're trying to learn how to draw you won't get anything from this book. Apparently based on a reoccuring segment from a British TV show, where the author would show celebrity guests ""how to draw instantly"", this book has all the depth and insight you would expect from such a venue. There are some great books on art technique and instruction, this is not one of them."
5,pennplax bath,Birds really love this bath as it is large and gives them alot of room to bathe.Very sturdy and easy to clean
3,CD Doesn't work!,The Discovery Airport Cd has refused to work...it insists I need to install a newer version of Quicktime yet if I try to do that the system says I have the latest version of Quicktime available and there does not seem to be any Quicktime on the CD to install. My daughter LOVES the other 2 in the pack and am sure she would enjoy this-if it worked........ANY IDEAS????
2,Simplistic,"I hadn't played any of the Battlefield games so I didn't know what to expect.What I found is pretty simplistic. The game just doesn't have the tactical options and complexity of Tribes 2 or Joint Ops.Its a pretty game to look at, and its fun to play in the Star Wars Universe but it seems like a game for nintendo players compared to the team shooters I'm used to playing.The multiplayer interface and chat systems are just plain painful. This game was obviously designed for console and thrown at the PC market incomplete."
1,Simply Boring.,"What can I say except this game is simply boring. The novelty of it being a Star Wars game was over in a few minutes. The graphics would be great, if it had been released a few years ago (like 5 year agos). Same with the game play. Compared to even Half Life 1 or some of the other first person shooters, this game is more like Red Faction. The game play very repetitious and just boring. The graphics are sub par. The vehicles are cool looking but that is it and driving them gets very old fast.Save your money and try Half Life 2, UT2004, or even Half Life 1."
4,"Pretty good, some things should have been more realistic","I enjoyed this movie, though I knew a lot of the stuff was very unlikely and nearly funny, I thought the director over did it a bit. Though I still enjoyed it and cried. The other ""Side"" was a bit to much for a lot of viewers i imangine. I highly reccommend Single's Ward for every one! This was a big too Serious and single's ward fixed that. Keep in mind I know several of the hilarious actors. I would get singles ward and consider God's Army. Maybe see it once or twice"
5,GMAT,Best review book for the GMAT!Kaplan GRE & GMAT Exams Math Workbook: Fourth Edition (Kaplan Gmat Math Workbook)
1,Horrible!,"This is so shameful that it makes me think there should a federal agency whose mission it is to keep things like this off the market.First off, it is a ""Director"" movie, which means /really/ old software technology, which means adding a high degree of boring and uninteresting user interface.The features in this software are awful. There are none, essentially.I was really hoping to find something along the lines of Mavis Beacon Typing, with games and such to help me work on chord progression and key scales. There's nothing like this.And the woman who is featured in the video clips is truly frightening.Its like this product was explicitly designed to invoke all the ugly memories we have of being forced to take all those boring piano lessons with that grouchy old person when we were kids.If you want to start making music, don't buy this. Buy the ""Complete Idiot's Guide to Music Theory"". MUCH better."
4,New product,"Excellent service, and the product worked extremely well.The only criticism I would have is the cost of Postage. it was ridiculous, the product came in a big parcel, and inside was a dvd."
4,Overall a very good powermetal CD,"Angel Dust is from Germany and plays powermetal, not unlike that of Blind Guardian. They are obviously less technical than that band. Their songs are good, and they have a great vocalist, unlike that of the band Nevermore. I don't really have a favorite song, although the title track ""Of Human Bondage"" is excellent. This is my first Angel Dust CD. Enlighten the Darkness is also very good. Buy both. If you are into powermetal, get this CD. Most of the CD is great, although the end gets a bit repetitive. Also, get the limited edition version double CD set with the powermetal sampler disc. It's an excellent value."
5,Should Have Reviewed This Awhile Back!!!!,"I'm from the Bay Area so I support the whole Thizz Nation, etc! Bang Fo Bread is one of the sickkest albums I have ever picked up! So don't think about it, just buy it."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THEIR FIRST CD. NOT EVEN CLOSE.,"GUNFIGHTER IS COOL, SO IS STICKS AND STONES, GIMME NO LIP, AND GYPSY,BUT THE TRUTH IS THIS CD EVEN THOUGH TOOK TWO YEARS TO COME OUT AFTER THE DEBUT, SOUNDS A BIT RUSHED AND AT TIMES TOO CHEESY. THE FIRST CD IS AN ALLTIME CLASSIC. IT IS DIRTIER, MEANIER, AND SLEAZIER AND WORTH CHECKING OUT. HELLACIOUS ACRES COULD WAIT FOR THE SALES BIN."
4,Good,It was really good but at times a little slow or maybe just too detailed (not in a bad way but maybe a little boring). I still didn't put it down; maybe I was just too anxious to get to the next part. I hope there's another one because I really want to hear what comes next. It really feels like I got to know all the characters and would love to read more about them.
2,If You Lived Here,It was just not my kind of novel. Too many historical details and not enough plot or suspense for me.
3,If you lived here,enjoyed the read but was not what I call a memorable book. Good beach or pool read. i read constantly and sometimes a book like this is just a change of pace
4,I enjoyed it,"The subject matter of this book was interesting to me. I knew nothing about the lives of morticians. I learned a little about Vietnam too without feeling like I was reading a travel log. All of the characters were well developed. Her writing style appealed to me. This book held my interest all the way through. As I said, I enjoyed it!"
2,CAUTION WHEN CONSIDERING,"These radios are fun and have good sound, but they CANNOT BE REPAIRED! Mine fell off a bedside table and the windup mechanism and light no longer work. For a while C Crane offered repairs, but they can no longer get parts. Freeplay itself will not repair their products. For a company that is selling a 'green' radio that needs neither plug in or battery power, this seems rather hypocritical. So, be forewarned."
2,"only a couple of good songs, rest is mediocre","i wouldn't have purchased it if i had listened to it a little further before turning in my cash. first song (straight line to the kerb) is good, second song (what you have is good) is okay. i couldn't care less for the rest of the songs.disappointment."
2,This One's No Good,"Not much to say, really. ""Out of There"" is a fantastic album, and if you are looking for something from Departure Lounge and have nothing, get that one for sure. But this one has no good songs, no progession, nothing of interest. What I think happened was the following: Kid Loco and Departure Lounge teamed up for some mutual assistance. Departure Lounge got the bum end of the stick, while Kid Loco made out like a bandit. Instead of buying ""Too Late to Die Young"", you should get Kid Loco's ""Kill Your Darlings"" - it's a killer, and I wish Departure Lounge would have got as much out of KL as KL got out of DL. Buy ""Kill Your Darlings"", don't buy ""Too Late to Die Young."" But make sure you buy both ""Out of There"" (DL) and ""Kill Your Darlings (KL)."
2,Hold it Now!!!!,"The SanDisk WiFi card installation was easy to understand however only gave details of how to install the card if you don't run into any problems. I have an Ipaq 3955 and I installed the drivers and software to find that the card couldn't be detected. I uninstalled and reinstalled twice before search the internet for a fix. I updated my ROM on my device. Reinstalled my software and all of my personal data which had to be backed up before being erased to update ROM. After all that it still didn't work. Finally, on a fluke I find out that I have to hold the card in because it doesn't sit in the port correctly. After doing that too much I'll be working on a sure case of carpel tunnel syndrome. The browser works perfectly but, at what cost? Tech support wouldn't admit that others had the problem but I found at least 3 of the same complaints online. TS on recommendation is to return it and get another Sandisk. Maybe I'll return it and get anotherWiFi card all together."
4,Handy crash course for communicating in Germany,"This is a compact book that provides a big service to the traveler. It is easy to carry, which is no small matter when travelling. The book's sections are divided by types of conversations and/or day-to-day scenarios in which a traveler would likely find him/herself. Examples of sections include: transportation, shopping, accomodations, dining. It is easy to read and has all the basics to get you through your travels in Germany. The only downside is that it lacks a dictionary section, making it difficult to look up an unknown word quickly. As the title implies, this is not a comprehensive guide, but it will get you through most travel situations."
2,just ok,not sure it works all that well. very expensive. any sports rub works just as well. used this during a snow skiing trip to the alps for sore legs.
5,Kytta Salbe 50g by Merck Review,Kytta Salba is the best product that I have used for muscle inflammation.I highly recommend this product to anyone that does heavy physical activity.
2,Two great years... then all downhill,"I've had this camera for almost two years. When I first got this camera I noticed the red eye was quite significant. Turned on red eye reduction and everything was ok. After about 1 1/2 years with this camera, I found that the pictures started to have stripes running through them. In order to stop this from happening, I would have to turn off the camera and turn it back on and the pictures would be ok. Fully charged or now, this would happen after a few pictures were taken.Most recently, at year 2, I took pictures on vacation all week. Came home and the camera said card read error. All of the pictures were gone. Both the camera and the memory card were Fuji. Still working to recover the pictures and determine the problem. Will not buy a fuji product again."
5,Small radiios w/small speakers have come a very long way!,"This order arrived in two short days. I was surprised how well-packed the CrosleyR31 was packed. The radio was well construced (in China), looked great and sounds amazing considering the price. Received LOTS of stations, don't even think I will need an AM antennae for baseball games in the garage. FM is just fine. I regret not having bought it years ago.Crosley Companion Radio (Walnut)"
1,NO CONTROL!!!!!!!!!!,"How in the world can a game like this be released? It is unexceptable. You can not control your man. What may be cursor key straight ahead in one camera shot, will be left in the next...though you are still hitting the forwad cursor. Your man never stands straight, he's always at an angle and you are guessing which cursor key to hit...oops pick the wrong one and you're off the cliff. It is this insanity throughout. It is absolutley impossible to control your man and the camera angle. Decent 3rd-person role-playing games are like Star Wars Jedi Outcast or Tomb Raider The Angel of Darkness. The camera should station behind your character so that you can move your mouse and cursor keys accordingly....hello? Game Developers! Every PLAY one of these games before making one and putting it out on the market and charging $45 bucks!?!? Morons."
1,"GREAT Series, LAME video/DVD","The greatest series of our lifetime is highlited with too many edits. I think this was made for an audience with an attention span of a pea. What's with the fast panning, quick zooms, and random flashes of light? Many of the great plays are interrupted every two seconds for someones comments. Also, I can't stand this narrator who is trying to emulate Casey Kasem. Don't buy this unless you're used to the downward spiral of contemporary film editing."
1,Handicam Not PC Frienndly,I could not use the software that came with the handicam and I tried five other programs and none of them could access the cams video or controls - It may be possible to link PC and handicam but I don't have a degree in science fiction. If you're going to edit and make movies on your PC keep looking. This one is only for propeller heads.
3,Catherine and the Lion,"Catherine and the Lion is an creative story about a young girl who uses her imagination to have a lion as a friend, all through her day, at school and at home. The story encourages children to use their imagination and overcome their fears. It often helps little children (and sometimes adults), to face their daily routine by having an imaginary friend who will always be with them when they need a friend and not ridicule them at any time......a friend who will give them unconditional love. I recommend the book for children from 3 years of age and up."
5,25 Ft Cat 5e cable,Excellent Vendor & Quick Shipper Too !!!! THANKS !!!!!!We will be back for more great buys soon ... Thanks
5,Just As It Should,"No challenges with this product. Price is right, works with no problems. Ordered two of these when I got two new Internet / LAN enabled items for my A/V setup. Nice to have black Ethernet cables instead of blue."
3,It's aight!!,It's a pretty good dvd but the only problem i had with it is that at times you can't hear what some of the S.U.C. members are saying cause the volume is very low on some of the scenes
5,Lost in Space,"A true comedy. Dr. Smith and Robot. Funny man and straight man. And Will of course, straight straight man. The Creatures are so funny. Imagind a great big furry monster that has a long, thin protruberance with a great big huge eye-ball looking at you. Oh for the old days."
3,If you like camp....,"The special effects are pretty bad, the acting is ok given the dialoque...you've heard it all before...but if you like to watch TV for fun and silliness you might like this DVD set. I enjoy it because it brings back memories of being a kid and watching this show through the ""snow"" on the TV because it was the only channel we could get with our antenna."
3,Need help with a song!,"Can anyone help telling me the name & artist for the song that plays after prom, and after dropping the 2 couples, still inside the limo when they start making out? I couldn't find it in the soundtrack...Thks in advance"
3,Song,To - a music fanits not that song...that song is in the TV commercial i believe and the one i'm tlaking about is only in the movie trailer that shows in movie theaters....thank you anyway
1,Songs missing,The best song in the movie was not even on the soundtrack! It was David Grey's: This years love. Advertisement for the soundtrack said every single song from the film was definetly on there...yeah right!
2,Don't you hate when...,The only reason the soudtrack got a high review is because Amazon helps people get the real info via reviews like this:Don't you hate when they don't freakin' identify artists and songs in the soundtrack or in the credits... Here is the help you want for the song that plays when they walk through the curtain:The Song: Purple HazeThe Band: Groove ArmadaAlbum: LoveboxAwesome Song and Album
2,Song on Preview - Answer,"The song in the preview that was played on TV was ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love"" by The Darkness. Now maybe you could answer a question for me. Does anybody know the name of the David Gray song that was in the movie? They played it twice. One time was during the limo ride hoome from the prom. Thanks in advance for any help."
3,David Gray song in movie,"Yeah, the name of the David Gray song is ""This year's love"". It's a great song, and they did indeed play it twice. It had been bugging me for ages what it was, but now I know, I thought I'd share it with the world!Cheers, Mike"
3,The song in the cafe ...,"... when Danielle is making a drawing of her face, is ""Something in the Air"" by Thunderclap Newman, a one-hit-wonder group from 1969 put together by Pete Townshend. The vocal wasn't by a female though, it was John ""Speedy"" Keene. I saw the film for a second time tonight to make sure it was the right song (OK, and to see Elisha again). And it's on the soundtrack CD !"
1,Terrible,"Very very very very dissapointed....There were a couple songs missing on the CD, That's why i gave it one lonely star"
3,update on the songs,"The song from the house party and the Limo is David Gray's ""This Year's Love"" and is from his White Ladder album which is a great album.What I want to know is does anyone know the song from the end of the prom when they've finished filming. It sounds like The Who and has a great organ solo to begin with but I can't seem to find the song. Someone please help."

2,Please! Name that song; anyone!,"Okay, yeah, yeah...I know, the CD's so-so, but...there's this song I just CANNOT get out of my head! It's the one that partially plays when (you know the part where Danielle feels betrayed by Matthew after he tried to do it with her in that motel, lol) Danielle isn't there anymore for Matthew? It's really nice and soothing...lol. I like it, the voice seems familiar. I think some of it goes like ""...listen to an angel fly (I dunno, I may be makin' an ass out my self)"" . You know, it plays around the part(s) where he's (Matthew) looking out the window (at school), and Danielle isn't there anymore to pick him up...THANKS a BUNCH to any/all who reply!"
3,Help,"Can anyone help me I am looking for the title of the song, when they go the that high school party and he finally goes up and kisses her. Does anyone have a clue what the song is playing then...if so could you please help me out.ThanksCourtney"
1,Crappy Soundtrack,"Horrible horrible soundtrack, but to all of those who wanted to know what the name of the song was after he said I'm in a lot of trouble, it's Suffering by Satchel."
2,"Bad movie, great music","The music in this movie is superb, but they left out so much of the good songs. I remember hearing 'Lucky Man' by The Verve buth that wasn't on there. One Elliott Smith song but that's not there either. Teenage Wasteland by The Who isn't on there. I heard 'Like spinning plates' by Radiohead in the background once. All of these great songs and not one of them on the Soundtrack, how about that!"
3,PLEASE HELP,During the scene where she makes Matt strip in the street....what was that song with the heavy baseline and drums. It's also in the movie Godfellas but not on their soundtrack. This has been driving me crazy.....any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
2,Agree - this soundtrack missed a lot of great songs ...,"But to answer the question of the person who wanted to know which song it was when Matt and Danielle first kiss - it's David Gray ""This Year's Love"" from his CD ""White Ladder."" It's also the same song they play when they're in the limo to answer the other person's question"
3,when they are in the cafe...,They play a song that hasn't been ID'ed by anyone yet. It's where they are both in the cafe and she's coloring her picture w/ crayons. The song has lyrics w/ a female singer but you dont hear it. You only hear the refrain of the song for about a minute then they cut it out...what's the name of that song?!?!
1,prom song??,what's the song the plays when they all walk in to the prom with their pornstar dates and they're walking in slow motion and everything?
2,which is which?,i couldn't manage to get the name of the song which is played at the convention when she is fashioning and he is calling her daniel! daniel!
3,It's ok,"Homemade fondant is so much better. This fondant is pretty and easier as far as color is already there, but this fondant doesn't taste good. I would recommend homemade fondant to store bought. It seems like this type of fondant doesn't stay as fresh as homemade fondant."
4,Great product,Great product to work with. You don't have to nead it much. Wish there was more product. Bright color true to picture.
4,Roller Coaster of Emotions,"This book will lift your spirits, recall memories that allow you to revisit your past. It will cause you to cry, laugh, get angry, smile. It is truly a wonderful work. The words bring pictures to your mind that are clear and distinct. Oh for a time when simplicity was the norm and the modern day decline in human values wasn't even thought, much less acted upon. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I know you will too. The stories are broken up in to many short topics. This helps in keeping your intrest and allows you to read in piece meal fashion, making it very enjoyable."
2,so bummed,My husband was so excited to get this for our daughters room. I am sad to say it brook within 2 weeks. Of course after I had gotten rid of the box and paper work. It made awful noise and then just stopped rotating altogether. Plus it is much smaller than I thought it would be.
5,Serves it's purpose! For many ages!,I think too many people are looking for a wow toy for a good price. I feel like I got a good toy for a good price.I liked it so much that I bought another one for a present. Works for a mobile for a baby that I am watching too.And for the person that says that it eats batteries either they have bad batteries or I got lucky. I have the same batteries in it since Christmasand it is Valentines Day. We use it every night before we go to bed and before nap for the baby. I think it is great for the money. It is better than the TV or ipad or video games. Thank you Uncle Milton who ever you are.
3,Great Looks...Function Fair,"I purchased this for my 3 year old son's new Space-Themed room...He Loves it...It's Very cool looking...However...the construction is pretty flimsy, and It absolutely GOBBLES C batteries...so it will light up, but often will not turn...unless you're willing to change the batteries about every 3 days! Also, prepare to put pretty large holes in the ceiling for this product! For the price, it's OK for a three year old at bedtime...the ""Moon in My Room"", by Uncle Milton works much better..."
3,less than expected but cool looking,"flimsy. I bent wires to hold planets on, then glues other end of wire into base, otherwise, planets can fall off easily. Motor is so loud I wonder if I got a lemon, but someone else complained of this too. The moon is cool, but battery door came broken....planet decals torn. Overall quality less than usual for Costco....but looks really cool nontheless!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS TOY,"This toy is a piece of junk. There is a requirement that it be toggle-bolted into the ceiling with two toggle-bolts (provided) and the ceiling must be one of drywall. So if you give your child or grandchild this toy and you have a wood ceiling, forget about it! And who wants to toggle-bolt something to their ceiling and WHY DON'T THEY MAKE THAT CLEAR BEFORE YOU GIVE IT TO THE CHILD??? Our solar system is sitting on our coffee table, the remote control that makes it revolve is already broken. I emailed the company about alternative ways to hang the item and never heard back.I suppose if you have the right kind of ceiling and are an owner (not a renter) and you know up front that you are going to drill holes, it might work out. Otherwise, buy something else."
2,Such a shame...,"The Uncle Milton Light-up Solar System is awesome in design but horrible in function. It looks great and works far less than expected. Despite many battery changes and following the advice of the Uncle Milton staff, it just doesn't work for more than 15 seconds. Just to get it to revolve it must be hand started. The very few times after it was first installed it did work and my son was enchanted. [...]"
2,not what I expected,"I went with an outer space theme room for my 5-year-old son's bedroom. When I came across this item, I knew it would add the perfect touch for his room. Foolish me for not further researching the product, but I was under the impression that this product takes the place of main light. It does not. Instead you would have to drill new holes in ceiling with a 22 inch clearing all around (for rotating planets) this concept in my son's square room would just look awkward (two lights practically side by side). Now I can't imagine anyone wanting to use this product as a main light source for any room given that it is a:battery-operated, and b: is way too dim to be useful. I think the idea of the product is great, but they should definitely design one that just easily becomes the cover plate for an existing electrical ceiling light."
2,Huge Disappointment,"This toy is of very poor quality and barely works. The motor that turns the planets isn't very powerful, and often I had to physically give the planets a push to get them started on their orbits. When it does run it is very loud and distracting. And while the sun does light up, it's a very dim light barely brighter than a nightlight -- you have to turn the overhead light off to even tell that it's on.The planets are on flimsy wires and can fall off easily. It takes a steady and gentle hand to hold the mobile when changing the batteries to keep from knocking all of the planets off.My 4 year-old loves the planets and was dying to get this, but after only 6 months we've taken it down and he doesn't even miss it. Instead, he's taken the individual planets off of the mobile and plays with those on their own."
1,This was not what I expected from a textbook.,"First of all, I didn't notice that it was paperback, because really, what textbook is paperback? Also, for a book that costs $80, I expected it to fall apart within the first week of getting it. We started in chapter 12 in my class, and literally every page of that chapter fell out within two weeks. Also, The paragraphs and examples are poorly delineated, it's entirely black text, so it doesn't include the different coloring that would be used to signify important concepts are not present, making this book incredibly hard to read. Also, it's in two parts, which is really annoying. Overall, this was a horrible purchase and I am never buying a paperback textbook again."
4,Great to view,I really enjoyed this film. The guys are very sensual. I enjoyed this film enough to look into other title by this producer. They have some very erotic videos. This being one of the best.
3,Interesting,I thought that the video was graphically entertaining. Amazon should have more videos like this and also include videos of different races and dynamics.
2,Kindle version bungles the texts.,"Content aside, the kindle version of this book is extremely difficult to maneuver due to clumsy placement of footnotes and consistent misspellings. Recommend for paper, not for e-reader."
3,Cute story,"This is a traditional Regency novel. It is a short novel and the story progresses quickly and the characters are likable. This is not the type of historical romance that I usually read or like. I like the longer, more complicated historical romances, so I do not think I will be buying or reading a traditional Regency novel any time soon."
3,What start great becomes boring soon.,"First of all, this is a great piece of music! Smooth sounds, great melodies that move you right into the old golden swing era of the 20th century. Definitelly worth a buy.The music is very diverse, from fiddle to trumpets, with unique and ear catching sounds, rhythms and vocals.What I dislike is that nearly every track starts with these very beautiful rhythms and melodies but after half a minute ends up in a near improvisal music-chaos that often isn't fun listening to."
1,"who are you ,John Rambo ?","The perfect soldier is special operations, Special Forces, Ranger, Seal,Recondo, Airborne,pathfinder, etc, but all in ONE !The main part of this is each person mut be trained in all these areas to include things like Flying aircraft,driving all vehicle, horseback, you name He is trained with every weapon known to man ! An can speak every language and look and act like the natives to include pray ! my question is HAS HE LIVE THIS LIFE ??? I have and more. I need to know before I will answer, I knew a Master Sergeant Dunnigan, SOG, 5th Special Forces Group, Kontum, VietnamARF, US Army Retired"
1,Winwood Disappoints,"Upon listening to Winwood's latest, I am astounded about how the talented muscician squanders his skills. Smooth jazz stations in NYC to this point, and philly probably later, have played his ""Plenty Loving"" which is arguably the smoothest and best song by anyone of 1997. It is this stand-out duet with Gabrielle, which features a sexy guitar hook, which drraws attention to the fact that the rest of the songs are inept. It's too bad that Winwood didn't see or industry insiders would not allow for Gabrielle and he to make an entire album together as both do better here than on individual outings. I only hope that a single is released, so that fans of ""Plenty Loving"" don't have to sit through plenty garbage. END"
2,NO Good Songs,"ok people how in the world did you ""other"" amazon reviewers give anything better than three stars! when i think of steve winwood and any of his albums...except ""junction 7"" i can name any song and sing to it!, that is NOT the case Here!, i don't even recall a song title!, i know there are a couple of decent tracks, nothing memorable though...anyone who is thinking to buy this please think twice about it! , i'm warning you it is not good.and as for you steve winwood lovers...how could you rate this medicore at Best album, a great classic review!"
4,As Good as Back in the High Life,"I'm totally bemused by the poor reviews of this album - it is more poppy but so what - it's a 90's version of Back in the High Life ...the duet with Des'ree on Plenty Lovin' is great; the remake of Family Affair a favourite and Someone Like You is a great love song. If you are critic of Winwood because this doesn't stay with the roots I'm not sure how you could also be a fan of his Grammy winning music in the mid-80's. It also was commercial in nature - as this is. It sounds good, it makes you feel good and the music touches the heart and speaks to you. What more can you want. To the critics - this isn't earth breaking stuff but why must it be - it's music not the bill of rights!!!"
3,Not very sturdy,"Okay, not very sturdy...got through 1/2 of the summer. Too much money spent for the little amount of time it lasted in the pool."
5,1994 geo tracker 8 valve,if you have a bad/erratic idle with black wet soot coming out of the tailpipe and lousy miles per gallon this will cure it
5,Hated to see the end of the book,"The detail of what happened before during and after is fascinating. The only thing that bothered me was how many of the buildings where concerts were held have been demolished. We just don't care enough about history to preserve what is historical. Money is more important. Anyway, I would love to go to the Winter Dance Party next February. A 14 hour drive in the middle of winter is tough. I am glad that it still exists."
2,Uug !,"The English was slurred. And the dialogue was so poor that I thought maybe this movie was trying to show the retardation of Caesar. I donated it to the local thrift shop, because the movie wasn't worth a second viewing. Yuk!Jo Jo"
4,Llamas are from South America,I love this collection and I don't mind about the boxes because most of the time I will de-box them. I love the color of her outfit and her face looks fine to me. The description on the back of the box has an error. It reads that llamas live in the Aztec land. Llamas are from the ANDES in South America.
2,The box is horrible for collectors,"They changed the box from the previous years. As a collector I am not impressed. The doll is very beautiful, but is now very accessible. Both front and back of the box can be removed and the doll can be ""played with"". If you buy this from a store, you don't know if it has been NRFB. This would make the value for collecting go down. Plus, now my boxes don't match and look horrible (with the entire collection together). Overall I am very disappointed."
5,astounding and powerful program,"Although it has taken some time to learn, this program will serve perfectly the purpose for which it was purchased. As a cyclist, I am always interested to track my routes. Now I can prove that outrageously steep climb to my buddies and regonize dangerous decents before I choose a route. It helps to know where you're going, and this program allows you to see where you are going... literally, if you download the free satellite imagery for a specific area. Well worth the money. It's even fun just to roam the the entire nation!"
2,Cheapie,This is not a good product. The hose loses its spiral integrity by only stepping on it. The metal connect is cutting into the hose only after a few uses. This is a $7 china special.
1,Worthless,This whip hose is not anymore flexible than the hose that comes with the sprayer. I love the sprayer but the hose was a waste of money.
1,Don't waste your money,"I just wonder if the people who reviewed this CD were relatives of the performers. This is not a good recording. The singing uneven, actually not good in some spots. The engineer at this recording session must have had trouble with his equipment. This is not a crisp clean performance. The balance of the orchestra is off in spots. Do not waste your money. I was extremely disappointed in this recording and I love Handel, I bought this to replace a worn out CD. I will have to keep looking. I should have stuck with EMI."
5,The best,"This is the best recording of the Messiah that I have heard, and I have heard quite a few. The diction is so good that you understand each word. Even the choir can be understood. The soloists are not famous singers, and the humility of their performances as well as the technical skill is a pleasure to hear. The piece itself was written to showcase the Word of God and also to display vocal range. This is a great way to introduce non classical listeners to classic music with the best theme there is Jesus Christ!!"
4,Messiah London Philharmonic,The cd came to me in very good condition and in a timely manner. I would definitely order again. Thanks!
5,The best possible Christmas gift in the world - replace old audio tapes with the quality expected of the London Philharmonic an,"See aboveAt a time when I was missing Christmas as I knew it at home and growing uop, and when my Mom, great lover of The Mesiah, was still alive, this brought me a joyful reunion with what is most meaningful at my core. Having the CD, versus old audio tapes, was a wonderful upgrade; quality meets my very high expectations. I am delighted the whole composition fits on two CD's. It has brought me joy, joy, joy and moves me deeply at the core of my faith."
5,Very entertaining book for Hoosier PRR affectionados!,I can't read enough about the Pennsy and generally enjoy most books about the railroad. This book gives a good overview of how the PRR came together in Indiana in the early days and how it came apart at the end. I was very entertained by this book and learned a lot about the operations in this state.
1,Even the most avid fans of Asian horror should pass on this.,"It should be a crime to compare this with Tobe Hooper's classic Chainsaw Massacre. This is a terrible movie and a complete waste of your life.If you want to see a strange and violemt Japanese horror film, pick up All Night Long instead. It is miles above this garbage."
3,A little too morbid!,"I'm a big McCaffrey fan but this is not one of the better ones. It gives a good amount of background information, but it's kinda sad. It tells about Sebell, Petrion, F'lar and F'nor's father, Lessa's history, Fax's rise to power, so if you want background info on them that's why you should read it."
4,Very Good,"I was so very happy to get another Pern book, thoes of us who wait with baited breath for Anne's books are. I was also distruberd with Cameo's Parentage. This book did fill in alot of the missing information in previous books. Can we get some more books about Avias or The White Dragon?"
1,"uh, no","This is definately not one of McCaffrey's better books, or even one of here mediocre books. This is one of her BAD books. There is no interesting action, no real conflicts between Robinton and his father, or any one else for that matter. Some of the explanations for certain elements of Pern and its various aspects were just a little too pat. She totally messed up Sebell's timeline by forcing him into this book, making him at least ten years older than he is in any other book. Fax's rise to domination is not given good enough attention, and the treatment of both dragonriders and Harpers was not what I'd been lead to believe in my reading of DragonFlight. The ending was too contrived, and Robinton over all was too perfect to be believable. In short, Please, whatever you do, Ms. McCaffrey, don't answer the demands of your fans by forrcing your work any more, please! The results, if this book is any indication, are not worth the effort."
2,Not worth it,It's adorable and entertaining for the first 5 minutes. After that it just takes up space. Puppets are impossible for a childs little hands and the background sags when hung.
1,"Small, hard fit","I was very disappointed in this purchase. Although very attractive to look at, the shoe fit is very small, and its insole hard. The cost to return makes that option not feasable. I am trying to ""stretch"" it"
2,Misconceiving,"The book is nothing like the title. Thin pages, heavy, and not at all attention driven for a young child."
4,Cute Book For Paging Through on a Rainy Day,"Yes oh yes, the title is deceptive. I got to page through this book before I bought it at a local store. It was priced way down and my soon to be 2 year old LOVED it. He brings me the book daily and he picks out a page and we talk about it, then go to the next page, then flip to another....you get the point.Would I ever sit down and just do one ""day"" with him? No. Are there ""activities"" in this book? Not really, maybe just pointing out your belly button and making faces. But it is insanely cute, brightly colored, touches on colors, numbers, art and so forth.It's a good book for a day when your bored and remember you could be doing something more productive with your toddler. Fun, cute, and to the point. It's engaging for young kids, all my boys love it."
4,not bad,"i bought this cd because i love both bands. when i finally listened to it, i was pleased. some of the rancid covers could have been better though. but nofx does a great job. hey blew me away with their cover of ""olympia, WA"". it was faster and better than the rancid version. i also thought their cover of ""corozon de oro"" was good. the rancid covers weren't bad either. i really enjoyed ""bob"", it was either as good or better than the nofx version. but the cover of ""don't call me white"" was bad. brett really is a good bassist, but he just doesn't sound like fat mike. he doesn't bring that ""humph"" to the table as lars or tim do. so all in all, a good cd for your collection."
2,Not the best choice,"I've had the camcorder for only a few weeks and used it right out of the box. There is an easy setting mode that enables the most inexperienced user to use the camcorder right away. Chapters are automatically set up on the DVD during each pause while recording.If you are looking for video quality though, there are better choices. I've been researching camcorders since I bought this one and have found that the MiniDV camcorders are the better choice right now - in this price range.The video quality on the Sony DCR-DVD305 is fair, at best, even on the best video setting. I have only used the camcorder indoors - maybe the video quality would be more acceptable outdoors.If you do decide to buy the camcorder, I would suggest buying a wide angle lens for a better area coverage during filming. You can buy one for around $50.00.Overall I rate this camcorder as fair due to the video quality."
5,One Great Camera,"Just received my Sony DVD305 a few days ago and am extremely satisfied. I have put this camera through the ringers, from Black and White, to Sepia, to Still Images, to Super Night Shots and I firmly believe this is the best camcorder I've ever owned! I was particularly impressed with the small size, yet the image stablizer really controls any shaking. The still images are fantastic for a 1 Mega Pixel camera.You cannot go wrong with this camera, not to mention it was over $150.00 cheaper on Amazon than getting it from Best Buy, Circuity City, or Ultimate Electronics!"
4,Karl is wonderful!,"Urban is my favorite actor, and I only gave this a 4 because it wasn't quite as good as The Price of Milk. Still, considering budget problems and time constraints (it was filmed in 6 weeks, all at night, in Wellington), it was quite an excellent film. You have to suspend disbelief, but it is geared more toward messing with your mind than shocking you with scary looking images and creatures. Is Harry being stalked, or is he going crazy? I have to say, I was looking over my shoulder for days after I watched, and Karl is an absolute delight when he works. You should definately watch this movie"
1,Starquest....the quest of a really bad movie.,I never write reviews but I thought it was my civic duty. This isn't a review but more of a warning....This is the worst movie I've ever scene....seriously ever. I do enjoy some very low budget movies especially horror films but this isn't funny or entertaining. I will not elaborate on the film itself because it's too painful.I strongly recommend that you don't even rent this film. I did and can't believe the company I rented it from would even have this in their library. Legal action should be taken....I just got robbed. It was like paying someone to beat yourself up.I suggest you visit IMBd for a review on this excuse for a movie.I do thank the makers of this film because I know that I will never see a worse movie the rest of my life. Please save your money.
2,It's a stinker,It's a stinker but I bought it because I was jonesing for bad Sci Fi and it most certainly was.Plot was bad but not too terrible and acting was stiff.It is a candidate for MST 3000
1,game wouldn't load,"This game is over due for the bone yard, it will not load in the latest 64 bit operating systems. I'll let this copy go cheap."
2,Far Cry,"This is a pretty game. However, it is comparable to a Chopped sirloin on sourdough with sesame and pomme frites - in other words, a fancy version of a Happy Meal (hamburger and fries). It is an elegant effort but nothing new. The AI is standard. Any game that I must repeatedly re-play after each death until I have mastered the play sequence isn't interesting. It is repetitive. It is repetitive.it was advertised as groundbreaking or somthing. i disagree wholehartedly. it is playing the level untill you know where every single bad-guy is, and then taking them out with inaccurate wepons and constant reloading before they shoot you back. not fun at all. buy battlefield vietnam instead"
1,Awful,"I have a fairly new PC - P4, 2.8 GHz, 1 GB RAM, GE Force FX 5200 128MB Graphics card, and the game barely works. I tried many different settings but none seemed to help. There are areas where the game just slows down to a crawl. I tried the patch and it didn't help. I give up!What a waste of money. I'm returning it."
3,A Great Game,"PROS:This game is tons of fun..the plot line and voice talent is a little lacking but your not playing this for the beautiful character arcs, you wanna blow stuff up, and this game is one of the best FPS/Action/Shooters out there today. Great graphics, large, highly explorable, environments and pretty decent A.I. will keep this game fun and exciting every time you play.CONS:No coop feature to speak of. However, I did find a user created mod that allows Multiplayer Coop but it is still really buggy and doesn't work all the time...OVERALL:Buy this game you wont regret it...unless you are looking for a Coop specific game."
3,Dated but good,"Didn't actually buy the game, as I am a member of Gametap and this was added to their lineup several months ago (you can also get it from Fileplanet as a download for less than $10, and no doubt there are used copies going for that or less on Amazon). I enjoyed the game, even though the graphics are now a little dated. Not a great game, but if you can get it cheap, it's definitely worthwhile."
1,Won't store checkpoints.,This appears to be a very good game but it is impossible to play because it will not store checkpoints. You have to start over at the beginning every time you play. Others have the same problem. Technical support cannot be reached.
5,FarCry for PC,"Great game and very challenging. Tons of action and new sequel called Crysis. This game (FarCry) might be a couple of years old, but it will still keep you glued to your PC for hours of excitement.Game arrived on time, just as I expected it to."
4,Absolute Awesomeness,"Ok. So I go out and get this game and the first thing I notice is that there are 5 discs!So installing takes about 15 minutes (on a not-too-stellar computer)I start playing and notice the awesome graphics and sound.IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE ARE GUNFIGHTS HAPPENING IN YOUR LIVING ROOMAnyway, The voice acting isn't too great, but that is easily overlooked.I start playing the first mission and I have to reload around the 5th checkpoint like 20 times!The game is ridiculously hard because of the crazy AI.The enemies in this game are like super-smart and they killed me over and over and over.This game is addicting. Even though I kept losing, I kept replaying until I won.The bottom line:Great sound, bad voice acting, ridiculously smart AI, AWESOME"
2,"5 stars, are you guys kidding!","Yeah, this games looks great. But this game ran on it's easiest level is next to impossible. Unless you have hours to spend dying and restarting in the first 5 minutes of the game. Save your money. It's better spent on something like PAINKILLER or UT2004. After reading all the reviews and then buying the game, I'm very disappointed."
2,"Hipe, Hope, Disapointment","Good Day,I must first tell you that I am a gamer and build computer all by hobbie. My rig is a P4 1.8 with a gig of RAM, GForce 4 4600 TI with 128 of RAM on it. I also have a SB audigy 2. So I will not say that my rig is top of the line but it is still a nice rig. For example my rig eats UT2004 (set to highest everything) For lunch. That being said, Far Cry Promised us a great FPS and gave us a middle of the road shooter with a good story. The game is very chopy and does not play well. By that I mean that while loading it sometimes crashes. also while playing as well. The graphics are just okay. One thing that bothers me is that you can not use your wepon while you are in the water. Thats crazy. The story is a good one and that is why I game it 2 stars. In short don't waste your time and money on this game if you are a true gamer."
2,Description and picture is Polycog but I got Polyrib.,"I wanted the Dayco Ploycog belt. What I received was Dayco Polyrib. This Polyrib has the same part number as the Polycog I bought in 2004. The Polyrib belt only has grooves running parallel of the belt, not criss-crossed like the Polycog. The picture in item desription is of Polycog."
1,Worse piece of crap you could buy,"This product will not let you drag and drop mp3 files into the mp3 player like every other mp3 player on the planet. It makes you convert your mp3 using their software to do it. Most of my mp3 library will not transfer over. I bought a Scandisk and every file went in with no problem and plays great. Sony if you were trying to make a product that sucks, well you succeeded."
2,Not real happy with this player,"Unlike a couple of others, I have found this product to be rather undurable. I don't know what the deal is - perhaps a problem with the battery housing - but I now need to hold the thing steady in my hand while working out or else the power shuts off. Also, the shuffle feature is horrible: The same sequence of songs is repeated over and over again rather than a true random sequence being generated. And as others have said, adding and changing songs on the player is slightly cumbersome. I'm now in the market for a new player."
5,impressive!,"I just doing a study on Psalms 23 I notcied that Kraus' commentary far surpasses all the other commentaries out there, even though it was written a while ago. The rest of the commentary should be just as excellent"
5,Best P.C. game ever.,"this game is one of, strike that, the best game i have on the P.C.The gameplay is great, the stealth action is awsome, and the musicin this game is some of the best ever, especially the music in the Acuda Bar. my only problem is that the game is too short for better players, 3 or 4 days. and this game was not very hyped up, not manypeople played it, makeing it an Underdog.- Devin"
1,Legalistic & without grace,"Scripture is used, yes. Sadly, it is so legalistic that if those truly desiring counsel for a problem they are in the midst of suffering, they will hear little about God's grace & forgiveness.In a nutshell, it's message is ""if you get right with God , then you wouldn't have the problem in your life"". Also messages of condemnation are very strong here.Very legalistic with, no truth in love spoken here."
2,Too Big,This peeler has a much bigger cutting space than I expected. I was looking for just a good handle on a regular veggie/potato peeler. This peeler makes huge cuts. The potatoes end up being half their original size after I've peeled it. The protective sleeve is nice since it will probably sit in my drawer for a long time unused.
3,"Basic, Just as Described","This corkscrew gets the job done. It is comfortable to use and not a lot of force is required to remove the cork. However, I have had some problems with the cork breaking, even on more expensive wine bottles."
3,Holman NT Commentary for Gospel of John,"I have a new Apologetics edition of the Holman Christian Standard Bible. I was looking forward to using the new commentaries in my study of Scripture as I prepare to teach on the gospel of John on Wednesday nights.The new ""commentary"" on the New Testament Gospel of John published by Holman, edited by Max Anders and authored by Kenneth O. Gangel is very easy to read.Unfortunately, I would not recommend it to a student who wishes to do an in-depth study of the gospel. I am afraid that it includes too much of what I feel today's student is already being taught: that is just a light ""coating"" of knowledge and/or understanding. There is not enough depth to make it suitable for the student who wishes to gain a deeper understanding of what this gospel, especially, teaches."
5,A Must Read for this Series,"I've read all of the books in this series and enjoyed everyone but of all of them, this is the best!Magdalena Yoder hasn't lost any of her tart personality in this clever turn of direction of the series. In this one she gets away from the inn while trying to find out who killed Reverend Schrock. He died when someone put peanut butter (to which he was allergic) into the chili he was tasting for the annual chili bake off.Many secrets are revealed - some of them very surprising to fans of this series.Magdalena is still Magdalena but the book is fresh and absorbing.A must read if you've read any of the others in this wonderful series."
5,Perfect!!,"A belt worth the price! Durable, and well built. Would purchase this again without hesitation! A much better belt than a ""quickie"" oil change place will sell, and for a much better price."
2,Disappointing,"This book had a good premise, but the author went off in the wrong direction. It's the story of Beth, a divorcee who is still sexually inexperienced despite years of marriage. (She'd never even seen her husband naked.) She discovers that a teenage boy, who works with her in a shop, is sexually attracted to her. This could have been a book about two sexually innocent people exploring and learning together. It wasn't. Beth decides to punish Jonathan for his interest in her. This was totally unrealistic. A sexually inexperienced woman is not going to suddenly turn herself into a S&M queen. This book was ugly and far fetched. It's only for people who are attracted to S&M perversions."
5,Thin wallet,"I love how thin this wallet is. Were I to design it, I'd make the clear ID pocket like the opposite side with three staggered pockets instead... but it is still 1/2 the size of my old wallet. I like it. I've been using it for a few months, it seems to hold up well."
4,Front Pocket Wallet,This wallet was what I was looking for when I needed something that wasn't going to bother me while I was sitting down. It is simple and lightweight. The only downfal is that the middle compartment that can hold money is not extremely secure and sometimes I am nervous money will fall out but haven't had any trouble yet. Great wallet overall.
4,Not Durable,"I bought this wallet because I needed a much smaller, slim, and light wallet to hold all my necessities. Also, because of the fact this got a reasonably great amount of positive reviews attracted my attention. I got what I wanted, and I'm happy with it. The only thing is that the wallet isn't very durable. I had a few bent ends on my wallet due to my clumsiness of moving around alot, but other than that though-- it was a good buy. Recommended."
5,Great Wallet - No Costanza,"I love this wallet. Plain and simple. It has enough room for about 3 credit cards, 10 business cards, some cash, and my DL. All I really carry is my DL and by debit card, a handful of business cards, and I am seldom lucky enough to have any cash. If it were to be lost or stolen, I am not going to have to reconstruct my life - a trip to DMV and a call to the bank would be it.I use it both in the front pocket and the back pocket, and I don't have the George Costanza like back problems associated with a larger wallet. I even accidentally washed it once already, and it made it through with flying colors.I couldn't be happier with this wallet. So happy, I am tempted to buy another one in case it is discontinued so I will have a spare for the future."
3,Game,"So, I haven't played it much. I bought it for my little brother who loves race cars and motorcycle games. He doesn't play it much, so I assume he doesn't like it. The good thing is I got a used one that was cheap. So it was all good."
2,"Loved 1-3, Hated 4","History is our favorite subject, thanks to Story of the World Volumes 1-3. The activities were pitched just right for our 1-4 graders, and we are planning to do the entire series again after finishing Book 4. However, unlike the first three volumes, the activity book for Vol. 4 was pitched for students somewhere in 8th to 10th grade. It was not an incremental step up from the other three levels, but a huge leap forward, maybe 6 grade levels or so. It was not at all accessible, fun, or even adaptable for lower grades, and we were so frustrated we quit the book in Chapter 14. I'd strongly encourage the editors and authors to remake this book to be accessible - as are the other three - for younger students."
4,Color - Not What I Expected,I was hoping for a nice purple grape color but instead the finish on this pan is a muddy metallic almost bronze. The style of the pan is nice and heavy. I just wish the color had been brighter - more energetic.
1,Poor quality,"Used item on 1 camping trip. Light was dim. After about 4 uses over 3 days, on-off switch broke simply turning it on. There was no drop or other damage. Essentially junk - look elsewhere."
2,Forget the sleeping pills!,The only people that need to read this book are students that have a professor that assigns it.
4,High Heel Stretcher,"Finally, shoes that are comfortable!! Why didn't i use these before? i could never wear pretty high heels because i have a wide foot. Now i stretch them. Wish they were sold in a pair."
2,Great Idea.....Now if it only worked,"If you're stretching high heel shoes, you really do a stretcher made for high heels. However, this one does not expand much past the width of any of the shoes I'm trying to stretch, so it can't get the job done."
5,It works,Excellent shoe stretcher. Does the job and I love the moveable nubby thingys that allow you to stretch in areas that may need extra.
5,Absolutely Great!!,This shoe stretcher works very well. It loosens up some of my strap shoes that fits tightly around my toes. This is definitely a must have. You will not regret it.
3,POORLY MADE,"Two pieces of advice/warnings: This device is made poorly. Mine also has little jagged pieces that will rub the inside of the shoe. It was my understanding the little metal bunion things were removable. Mine aren't. I'm afraid to attempt to take them out for fear that I might brake it entirely. Also, it's really big. I got the one for size 4 to 6 1/2 and it does go in my size 6s but if the shoe was smaller or had an unusual shape/design it might not fit. To be more clear, if you were purchasing this for a size 4, I don't think it would fit. I am going to keep it because it does work. I'm just going to have to be very gentle with it."
3,Not great if you just want to stretch toe-box.,"I have regular/slim feet but always have a tight toe-box on heels and shoes. I was hoping this would stretch the toe box area. Unfortunately this was made to stretch not only the toe, but the front half of the shoe including the sides. I didn't want the sides wide, just more room in the front. Just didn't work for what I needed. Also, I'm an 8 1/2 and think the size down would've been better."
3,Way too big,"I wear size 9 shoes. After reading the review, I order the one size smaller for 6-8.5. However, once it arrived, I can only fit the stretcher into my heels without the silver nobs - I meant round toe, open toe, and not even talking aboit pointy toe. Thus if I want to customize the stretch, there is no way to use the nobs. You can only stretch the whole front side of the shoe. My recommendation is regardless of what your size is, just order the smallest one possible."
4,Easy to watch.,Again one is given a look into the culture of another country. A father has to deal with his son and his own thoughts about homosexuality. It can be almost parallel to some parents in America even though this is shot in a different country. It was easy to watch and enjoyable.
2,Lacked alot of substance in film,I felt this film wasn't as fluid and strong as i hoped it would be. It had a good concept and theme with the two main characters but it wasn't portrayed as well. I thought the dialogue was weak and the acting was too simple. It could have turned out to be a great movie because it had a good concept and message but it lacked a lot of messing things to make it a complete movie.
3,Its okay ( 3.5 ),"The graphics on this game are really good. But who wants a Dodge Neon, Impreza 2.5, Lancer ES, Peugot ? Those cars suck monkey balls !! Nissan Skyline GTR R34 or Toyota Supra...these cars are absolute beast. The game gets kinda repetitive though. Like you're doing the same race over and over again SLIGHTLY more difficult each time. Overall it is definitely worth the purchase as we all wait for GT4 to drop in December. You'll just get bored REALLY fast, but maybe thats because most of the time I play alone. It is a lot more fun when you're racing friends because AI will bore you after a few days. Hope this was helpful...peace"
4,THOMAS THOMAS THOMAS WHAT AM I GONNA DO!!!!,LISTEN FIRST OF ALL THIS GAME BLOWS COMPARED TO THE OTHER NEED FOR SPEEDS I ALL READY WROTE A MILLION REVEIWS ABOUT THIS AND YOU PROBALY HERD ME SAY THIS GAME BLOWS THEY COPPY OFF OF MIDNIGHT CLUB 2 ALL IT IS IS A MAKE OF 2 FAST 2 FUROIS AND ALL THAT STUFF WELL THAT WAS ME CHARLIE V1 AND NOW THOMAS I LOOK AT HIS REVEIW IT'S NOTICEABLE THAT HE COPPYED OFF OF A MAGIZEEN COME ON LOOK AT IT IT'S LONG HAS HELL HE PUT INC. RIGHT NEXT TO EVERY THING LIKE HE COPPIED OFF OF A MAGIZEEEN PLUS HE NEVER WROTE A REVIEW THAT LONG AGO YOU CAN TELL HE COPPIED THOMAS RITE YOUR OWN REVEIWS AND STOP GETTING STUFF OFF OF MAGIZEENS!!!
4,what i game!!!!!!!!!!!,"the best game ever its got 20 cars that you make into to street racers.it has the song GET LOW,24'S EXT. ITS WORTH ALL 50.00. BEUT IF YOUGO TO TARGET YOU CAN GET IT FOR 42.99. WOW! I RECOMEND THE GAME."
1,Disfunctional,"This game freezes constantly and was extreamly scratched up apon arrival. When it does load (which is rare and time consuming) the road is invisible and we have to guess where to drive which ruins the whole game. This game was sold as ""like new"" but is actualy more ""like trash"" >:( Rip off!"
4,slick!!,Do you like your cars crazy with full boost acceleration this is it.This game is really neat. I like the way the cars are made.It goes even better with a steering wheel. If you have a need for speed do it underground.
4,Great,"Need for speed underground (NFSU) is an excellent game. We've also got Gran Turismo 3 and V8 SuperCars Race Driver (Australia) these are also excellent car games. We'd give all three 9/10. NFSU can certainly stand its ground even in that top class bunch.NFSU can be easy or hard depending on how you set it. Simple and straight forward races like drag or drift or more involved ones like sprint, which is more like a race track situation.If you want most realistic get V8 SuperCars, if you want a fun arcade game with good car and track selection get GT3, if you want variety and more modern graphics get NFSU.I'm not a fan of the style of music but gladly it can be turned off. Actually the entire teenager element that stamps this game is not me, well maybe it was 25 years ago but the actual game is that good I can look past that element. The game is fun.Recommended."
2,Don't beat the game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved this game, it was my absolute favorite but when i beat it, i finished with a crappy Lancer, and now i can't go back and get a skyline or a good car in underground mode. the reason why im mad at it is cause i race on line and now im stuck with a car with a few less stats. You'll see when you get there.(finish with a skyline) This game was great now i feel like busting it. (No good cheats eather)"
2,Not worth it,"This game is not worth what they price it. This is one of the worst EA Games I have ever played! Its complete unfair, even on easy the cars are at least 2 levels BEYOND you.. Takes for ever to unlock things, You never have enough money to buy anything! Don't get it until it hits 20 bucks, even then its a iffy."
4,ooooh what feeling Toyota!,"the game is very cool i cant stop playing it.. im beating everyone with my Mazda Miata but I cant wait to get my hands on the supra! but i was disappointed the game has no corollas they have them in gran turismo 1-3, tokyo extreme, s evution, auto modelista. How can u make video game that has driting with out the drift king the toyota corolla you cant be drifting in a honda civic . next time put the rea deal (trd) corolla, starlet, corona, old mazdas rx-7,old datsunsDrive:Drift:Dream . Keep the Old School alive"
1,never gonna be beter than gotham racing 2,"Comparing the graphics and the fact gotham racing 2 is live, underground will never match it. NFS games have always been at least somewhat arcadelike driving. It would be a better comparison to put this game up against the first gotham racing. If any of you writing reviews have ever played xbox live, I think you would call ps2 an inferior system too. Even though AI has improved greatly in the last year, there still is no better oponent than another human. I can't think of many new games xbox has come out with recently that doesn't have online capabilities, yet ps2 still hasn't made any real move in response. They need to just come out with a third one that can handle better graphics."
2,Why buy this if you can buy Burnout 3?,"The whole focus of this game is that you drive incredibly fast and customise cars. If anyone who is reading this doesn't know what Burnout 3 is, then let me give you the gist of it. The whole focus is that you drive about 10 -- no 100 -- times faster than this game, and you drive agressively. It doesn't have must customisation, but it's a hell of alot of fun. Raming apponents into walls and having them explode is much more fun than this game. This game decent at first, but then loses its charm. This game is slow compared to Burnout 3, has hideous music than will pierce through your eardrums like a butcher's knife, bad collisions, and is just not fun at all. Buy Burnout 3 if you want an excellent racing experience that you don't even need to like racing to enjoy and experience Burnout 3's goodness. Did I mention its only 20 bucks and there is a sequel coming out in a month called Burnout: Revenge?"
3,Characters Too Dark/Lights are Dark,"Somehow, I like racing games and I was hoping that this game will go over the line. And it's okay with cars and designing your own cars and then racing against other cars. Although, the racing sometimes get boring because you're racing in different races. That part is cool, but I hate the people because they look scary and dark in the background. The arrows are dark enough that you can run into them. The 3 goes on both because the background is dark as if you can't see no one standing beside your car or they are ghosts, but can't see them."
5,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is so awesome! The music is cool I love the cars and the customizations! I beat the whole game! Must have for car lovers! BUY IT!
4,It's Grinch Night in Bear Country...,"Brother & Sister go trick-or-treating with Fred & Lizzy. They plan to skip Miz Mcgriss' house, because they think she's Gruntilda from Banjo-Kazooie. Hey wait! N64 wasn't around by then! In other words, Too-Tall is gonna teepee the house.Why does Mcgriss always have a mad look on her face? She had it in this book, and she continued to have it in ""Prize Pumpkin""!"
1,Disappointed at take of the book for children,We have several Berenstein Bears books which my 5 year old son loves. I was disappointed with this one which talks about playing tricks/pranks on elderly neighbors. I would not recommend this book. Cordoroy's the Best Halloween Ever is a good choice.
5,The gift of sentiment,I gave this CD as a gift to my Mom. Sentimental Journey was her and Dads Song. she is 84. she loved it and reminisced for an hour about each song. It was a hit.
5,"Sturdy case, easy to mount","Has a sturdy case and it is very easy to mount. The operating system should detect it immediately, if not, restart the computer and that will do the job. It works with most of desktop's Optical Drive. Great if you want to buy a Blu Ray Drive for your aging and irreplaceable laptop."
3,Works well but has a high pitch hum,"The enclosure is easy to setup and use. I am currently using it with a Samsung 16X DVD-RW. The enclosure works well on my Linux OS. My only complain is that it generates a high pitch hum that is a little bit annoying, for that reason I make sure to turn it off after use. Overall if you are sensitive about sounds I would not get this other than that it does the job."
5,Great Value & EZ to Use,"This Vantec enclosure is a great value for the price and it's very easy to assemble and use. Highest quality aluminum enclosure with silent cooling fan, blue LED and vertical or horizontal mounting positions sets this enclosure apart from the rest of the pack. All the details are well thought out so when you open the box, you ""feel"" the quality. Using it couldn't be simpler. 5 minute fool-proof assembly lets you set up your choice of external optical drive. Don't waste time shopping around. If you need an external optical enclosure for your custom DVD or CD Burner, just BUY this one! You'll be glad you did!"
1,DVI pins different,"I could not use this cable, although its labeled DVI the pins on it did not line up for use on my monitor. Its close but not correct. I don't know enough to understand different versions of male DVI end. I wish the description had told me to check that the pins would line up and showed a close up image of it. As I said very similar but does not work."
5,snuggly!!!,"I think this is a great value--I love the pillows, the sheets, the comforter--all of it! And I didn't want white, to begin with, but it's beautiful! I have a deep blue-painted bedroom, and the white is so soft and crisp against it!"
4,The pigkeeper's daughter,"The two girls that appear first are quite pretty, with remarkable bodies. And considering the time this was made, it's probably all natural. Everyone plays their dumb roles to the hilt, and for me, it never got boring. There is no irritating constant tease like the Russ Meyer films... it's full nudity, but not pornographic. The video quality is excellent, and I laughed out loud frequently."
3,The house of Lim,This book is about the farm family. Aside from the family relationship that are not terribuly different from what you have seen in other works and think of every day living in the traditional family. One of WOlf's strengths in this book is her interaction with the lim family. This book is good to know the chinese large family which was village life for those with a general interest in china. It was interesting to know the other country's family society.
2,Appears to be a short in the cable.,"First, these are not high end cables. However, you'd expect there to not be any shorts in the cables upon first use. I needed the stereo split for a static install where I only needed to plug them in once and then leave them. There is a short in the TRS plug end. Usually these cables are fine as long as you don't physically plug/unplug them alot, but not this time. Not worth sending back, I'll probably put my own plugs on the cable now."
2,"Cute and plushy, but not very durable","Bought this for my (at the time) 4 month old Shih Tzu/Poodle mix. All five pounds of her tackled this toy within one hour. She seem to love the little nylon rope tail and the extremely plushy fur. The round body was perfect to her to grip on and the limbs and ears were the right proportions for her to gnaw on. The only problem was that puppies love to pick at things, and she picked at the toy until she discovered that she could pull out tufts of fur in a single pull. Sooo, within an hour of getting her muzzle on the toy the little piggy had bald ankles! I hated taking the toy away (she looked so cute playing with it and given what I paid for it) but tossing it would have been cheaper than the vet bill."
2,pig teether,"super cute and soft. after one week, the pig was already coming unstitched. couldn't use it anymore after the first week bc the stuffing was coming out."
3,very dense,"Well, this seems to be the only textbook on the topic of Symbolic Dynamics, but I think it fails as an ""introduction"". The initial chapter provides very little motivation for the use of Symbolic Dynamics, how it differs or improves on other fields such as Coding Theory and Dynamic Systems, and what kind of problems it would be most suitable for. Frankly, about 20 pages into the book I couldn't even remember why I was reading it.For better or worse (worse, in my case) the book is written in the style of traditional graduate math books... Definition, Proposition, Definition, Proposition, Definition, Proposition... with very little intervening discussion. Simple, simple concepts are presented in dense, dense notation. Some people appreciate this, I'm sure. Not me.In summary, I believe this book is written for smarter people than engineering sorts like myself, but as the only text in the area I think a more inclusive approach would have been appropriate."
4,Great sylish sturdy set!,I bought what looks like this pattern in Target a few years ago when they had it on clearance and paid much less for them. They have a nice solid feel to them and I've received many complements on them from friends. I've been putting them in the dishwasher all this time and the finish is fine. Not a five start rating due to the doubling of price compared to what I paid in 2003.
2,Fun but very frustrating!,"The biggest problem with the game is the AI, especially in later races. You have to run flawless races in order to advance. The customization is excellent but if you can not get past a race then how do you get the next upgrades? Regardless of difficulty level the computer never seems to get easier, every race gets worse and worse. Every time you think you may have it won a car comes out of nowhere and causes a crash which takes much to long to recover from. I believe that computer AI has to make it extremely difficult to win with out tons of repition simply to keep you playing, after you have unlocked all the upgrades and cars what is left? It is only a two player game and has no online play (for the Xbox). Rent this game have some fun the move on to better games with more replay value."
5,good video,"this is not a motion picture it is a documentary of the best martial artists in the world from bruce lee ,to jackie chan, to jean-claude van damme........this is a great gift for a fan of the martial arts or a fan of any great martial artist ....this video has biographys of all the martial artists....and if you're a fan of van damme like i am you'll love this video because it has a great biography of van damme and an interview with van damme's old trainer...it also has pictures of van damme never seen before by the public.....all in all......a great video....great for all ages"
4,Great history on many kung fu stars of the past and present.,"A very informative and entertaining documentary on the history of the Kung fu film genre, along with information and history on many of the grat martial arts stars. If your a Kung fu film fan and are looking for something to give more background and explination to the phenominon that is kung fu motion picture then this is perfect for you."
4,Denouement in the Peach State,"Decision in the West is well researched, and the narrative is well constructed from the various primary sources. In his own analysis, Castel drops the bombshell that Sherman was not a very good general. If only old Slow Trot, George Thomas, could have had his way, then things would have ended much sooner. Fortunately for the Union, the principles of industrial war were already kicking in, and good generals were no longer needed to win wars.Castel avoids the annoying habit of Civil War historians who name their chapters after a quote from primary sources. Unfortunately, though, he names them after the month during which the chapter's events occur. Is it asking too much to be able to look at the table of contents in one of these campaign books and actually have chapter names describe what the chapter is about?"
3,Good information in spite of itself,"The present tense narrative is irritating, and the author's irrational hatred of Sherman gets in the way; nevertheless, there's a lot of solid detail about the campaign."
4,Audubon Prints,"The book contains very good information. We were looking to buy a couple of prints for collectible purposes. Thought the book might have a few more pictures than it had, but we were able to decide what we wanted to purchase and we are very pleased."
3,information that anyone can use,"I thought this book was well written in that it is a book of filled with good information on bodybuilding. It has some very good tips for the beginner as well as the more advanced bodybuilder,written in easy to understand chapters without all that bodybuilding lingo which doesn't mean anything if you want to get a good solid foundation to bodybuilding!"
5,tree hut shea butter,"this product is EXCELLENT for anyone who has really dry skin or just wants a moisturizer that doesn't feel greasy and smell. I have migraine headaches and if I put on a moisturizer that has too much perfume I know I'm going to get a very bad migraine. With this product I can put in on everyday and never feel uncomfortable.My dad is 85 years old and this cream is the only cream that controls his itching and burning. His skin is quite dry because of his age and he LOVES it, tooNever be without it!!!!!!!!!Barbara from Brooklyn"
4,A cross between Oingo Boingo and John Lydon,"Does Adam Ant remind anybody else here of a cross between the manic carnival-feel of Oingo Boingo, and the manic flamboyance of John Lydon from Public Image Limited? Maybe it's just me. That aside, Antics is a great album that mixes New Wave with the low-fi sound of Punk. With a whopping 21 songs, there are just a few clunkers (I always hated ""Goody Two Shoes"" and the embarrassing ""Ant Rap"" that has some snooty french thrown in).My favorites:""Stand & Deliver""""Desperate But Not Serious""""Kings of the Wild Frontier""""Zerox"""
5,"Wow, just totally wow!","For a piece so short, this is touching, deep and moving. I'm a huge fan of Eve Ensler, and the Vagina Monologues, and this was another look at it that just touched me deeply. Honestly, I keep it handy and watch it regularly, because it's uplifting and so human. People get lost in stupidity whenever something they don't understand comes up. This video gives us a look into the hearts and minds of some amazing women who have worked hard to find themselves, a measure of peace, freedom and grace in their own lives.Beautiful Daughters? Beautiful People! Doesn't matter what you are dealing with in life, everyone could use a bit more humanity in their lives. This short is full of grace, beauty and real down to earth people. Real people, dealing with real life. Doesn't matter what your journey is, if this show doesn't move you and show you how real hearts and minds are, then I feel for you. If you happen to have some idea of their journey, our journey, then you'll love this even more."
1,Item is Not What is Described or Shown,"The Pedrini Black & Satin Foil Cutter that I recieved was not black at all, but instead clear. The item was made in China, not Italy as described. I returned it, so I cannot say anything on performance. I had read reviews of similar differences, but assumed Amazon had updated the item. They have not. I believe Pedrini has moved its manufacturing to China, as I ordered an apple corer from them and received a Chinese made product, even though the description said made in Italy. Buyer beware."
1,Not black as pictured,"I just received this item in the mail and it came clear, not black as pictured. My entire bar set is black, so very disappointing to get this in clear. The emblam in the middle simply reads ""Pedrini"", and does not have the word ""Italy"". It is manufactured by a company in New York, not even Italian. Just states that it is an Italian design. I guess I was expcting too much for $6. Amazon told me that if I order another they cannot guarantee that I would get one in black, so I went for the refund."
3,"NOT black as shown, but it works well.","As stated in some other reviews, the cutter I received was clear, NOT black as stated. However, the 'clamshell' package from Pedrini said ""Black & Satin"" on it. It seems that Amazon may have ordered the correct product, but the manufacturer screwed-up. Nonetheless, it does not excuse Amazon from making sure they receive and ship the correct items. There should be some level of quality assurance.Otherwise, the functionality if the cutter is fine. It seems flexible enough so that it will stand up to repeated use. There's nothing particularly outstanding, it works, and that's that. I would have given it 4 stars, but because of the mislabeling, 3 stars."
4,Evoking the 50s.,"I was married in 1950, so this delightful little volume speaks to me of an era now past. A writer and artist as talented and sincere as Charles Wrege successfuly wooed and won his future bride and life-long companion with these affectionate notes and charmingly illustrated envelopes and the US Postal service played cupid! It would make a wonderful anniversary or Valentine's Day gift to a loved one of any age."
5,Great read and sad,"I grew up as a big hockey fan of Sheldon Kennedy. I was horrified when I read about what Graham James did as a coach and then after reading this book, it makes me sick to read what all happened and how much affect something like that can have on a young child. It was well written and hard to put down. My brother in law doesn't read and I left him borrower this book over a camping trip and he read the book all day long and finished it in one day. It is very well written."
4,A bit dated but still a decent guide,"This guide is a bit dated but has nice exhibits of actual surveys and IT strategic plan component templates. It has good usable material for IT strategic planning, not just fluff. Recommended."
5,Love the Classic SitComs,"Instead of hoping TV Land would replay the oldies, we thought, let's just buy our own! We did and have no regrets - except that we didn't buy Newhart, Lucy, Andy, and more MOORE! That's next."
5,Fabulous!,"Another sensational season of Mary Tyler Moore and perhaps even better than season one. Season two continues with Mary in the news room and the usual cast of characters. However, season two begins to pick up on more social issues such as explaining sex to children, antisemitism, race, as well as some feminism-lite but despite the appearance of more serious issues Mary and Rhoda continue plugging away with plenty of laughs."
4,Indispensible,"When dear old Collingsworth passed away last year, I knew we were in for a dickens of a time. Our daughter, Bitsy, had Mexican help and I knew how hard it was for her to get those people to properly water her begonias. When we found Enrique, we were just beside ourselves. Such a nice young man! Unfortunately, his English, left something to be desired. Then, a few months ago, Bitsy - bless her heart - told us about these tapes and I've been listening to them during my hair appointments. Not only am I able to talk to Enrique, but the girls at the club are coming to me for advice with their gardeners."
2,"Messy, but my pug's favorite","These were too big for my pug when he was a puppy, but now he loves them and finishes one per night. We've nicknamed them the ""stinky beefs"" since the smell isn't great. I like that it's not a corn- or grain-based treat."
1,"too wide for a ""normal"" size foot",This product arrived on time and hurt my foot when I used it. I have a normal size foot (width wide) and my foot was in between the outside rollers. Only the middle roller actually hit my foot. Not worth the money. I sent it back for a refund.
5,Works great!,It works great for my Plantar Factitious. Put it on a towel to keep it from rolling away from you.
2,I think I wasted my money...,"First of all, I really respect Rob Thomas. I think he is a fanstastic songwriter and truly is an inspiration to me and my own musical endeavours (I have been a musician for over 20 years.)But this ""album"" just really isn't up to par with Rob's talent and abilities. ""Something to Be"" was a great album, but in many regards it was a departure from Rob's usual styles as experienced from his many years with Matchbox Twenty. ""Something More"" is even more of a departure. The songs seem very uninspired, especially the supporting ""band,"" which really feels like nothing more than computerized drum-box throw-ins.I gave the CD one solid play-through with my wife - a Rob Thomas convert thanks to myself - and both of us felt rather dissapointed. You'll probably see my copy up for sale in the near future.But again - please know that I'm not disrespectful to Rob (I'm a member of his fan club and wow do those people ever get touchy!) but hey, even Tiger Woods has his bad games."
1,Really Cheesy,"I can't speak for the rest of Smith's series but these worn anecdotes about authors are riddled with factual, spelling, and grammatical errors. She needs an editor.On the first page forty-five is spelled `fourty-five'.Aaron Sorkin was never an actor on The West WingHoratio Alger may have been a minister but was never a priestNo writer can be excused for using 'laid' for 'lay'.There are others, but the above proves the point. Moreover, if this is the way Smith handles the copy, then of course the facts themselves are suspect.The pages are also filled with whiz bang typography and exclamation marks, all of which make this a book one can readily leave off reading if one is truly looking for information, trivial or not."
3,Good,"I enjoyed it very much. I've downloaded most of the Kindle Agatha Christie stories and read them before bed to calm my mind. I tell my son each time I finish one, ""You'd like this story."""
4,Lady Sings the Blues,"Listen to the story from Ms. Fagan, instead of the Hollywood version. Please! There is just too much misinformation."
3,Succinct and to the Point,Career Counseling: A Narrative Approach is a good survey of applying Narrative Therapy to every day career counseling. This book can either be condemned for it's brevity or lauded for coming to the point without over-explaining and micro-managing the subject. This book is best read and understood by counselors who have at least some professional experience and are working in the field of career counseling.
4,STAX'S STAR DUO,"Never as deep as OTIS REDDING, SAM AND DAVE had nevertheless many hits and were popular in the sixties.The first record of this collection is wonderful, collecting vintage material written by ISAAC HAYES AND DAVID PORTER;a live version of SAM COOKE'S SOOTHE ME;the song TOE HOLD covered by many soul stars like WILSON PICKETT and others.DISC 2 unfortunally goes overtime, even if the first two songs:I THANK YOU AND WRAP IT UP are good.It's just like witnessing the decline of the duo, and that's a little sad to hear them overdoing it a little."
4,Small time user,Kicker met my needs. This was a one shot use to stop a squeaky sub floor. Kicker met expecations.
5,A+!,"Perfect fit for my son. These socks are durable yet soft and comfortable. They hold up to my son, who is rough on socks."
5,A fresh and racuous new author,"From the moment I picked this book up, I couldn't put it down. I even read it twice the day I got it. Jenna Leigh brings a quirky and very real personality to her writing. At one point, I said, "" Wow! That's actually happened to me."" Her characters are very realistic, I feel as if I know them or at least know people like them. I laughed out loud and became mad on behalf of the heroine, Allie. When a writer can bring out those kinds of feelings in a reader, you know you've got a keeper. I will be eagerly awaiting her next book. She has moved quickly into my Top Ten List of Authors to Buy. Do yourself and buy the book,you won't regret it, and if you're male buy it as a gift for that lady you know, she'll thank you for it."
4,"Good, dreamy book","This isn't one of those books with a clear story and a plot and all that. Instead, it's one that just describes something - in this case, a three-day fog and the effect it has on everybody.It's not a very exciting book, but it has its own quiet poetry to it, and the illustrations are to die for."
2,Sent it back,The cover is nice looking but I sent this book back. There is nothing new or special. The projects in the book are not interesting nor are they practical.
2,Fine embellishment techniques,"I was a bit disappointed in this book. The designs are not very modern nor old in a cool way. I don't think the techniques shown are very creative, but if you are looking for standard simple techniques like simple ways of applying beads or how to do binding and piping, this book is for you. I think there's too much text and not enough pictures."
2,Hard to have an MMO without players...,"This game is the worst mess that you can imagine, it completely ruins the great Star Wars name. If you are true Star Wars fan, this game will just make you furious. The servers are barren wastelands where it is possible to roam for hours without seeing another player. Game is buggy with a horrible combat system and ruined economy. All in all, your better off playing pong.Its hard to imagine what game these fanbois are playing but it cant be SWG..."
3,New Viewer,"I was very excited at the beginning of the book, but there were certain characters that would not have been missed. The story was good about Paula and Amber and Horece, I also enjoyed Rebecca and her strength to move on. I just think it was a little too much going on at times and it took kind of long to get back to the story you wanted to read.I picked up on a major mistake, when Sheila called her child on the telephone while she was at the hospital with Pam, they made it look like Emily went to take care of the children and she was in a comma.I did totally enjoy the zodiac portion, the book and the writing was not bad at all I just found myself a little more glued to certain characters."
2,Another one bites the dust,I buy a lot of Hosa cables but this particular model does not live up to expectation. I ordered 2 of these cable and only one of them was functional. Very disappointed with the quality of these and I'm looking to replace them ASAP. DON'T BUY.
3,Is it helpful?,I bought this book to help me study for my Algebra two class. Overall it is very good. The book gives you many different problems and shows you how to slove them. Algebra Tutor does not go into depth on problems and it is very general. As a refrence book it is a great help.
1,Unreadable,"Like most Baby Einstein books, this one was written by someone who had some pedagogic objective in mind but absolutely no feel for how children's books should read. Clumsily written and awkward to read outloud."
3,Motorhead? Maybe.,"Is this classic Motorhead? No. It's softer and lighter, (for MH, anyway), but is still quite interesting."
2,TSO,"It was ok I love TSO but this is not what I was expecting. The part with the girl I don't understand, I think it would have been better if it was just the concert. I wish I could have seen it before I bought it, I would not have wasted my money on it. I am very sorry would have liked to give it a good revue."
5,The spirit of christmas,I am a cynic by nature. After watching and listening to this DVD. I really enjoy Christmas and all it has to offer. This DVD will become part of my holiday tradition from now on.
2,Disappointing,"TSO and many of the other performers were great, but the DVD quality was substandard, much as if a video tape was digitized and put on a DVD. The story does not hold together well and the narrator does not speak clearly. I should have stuck with the album."
5,I Love this book,"I have had the privillage of seeing this book at a local craft shop and find that it is more then worth its money in floss! The patterns are easy, clear and can be imported into almost any design easily. I would like to thank the designer for such a wonderful pattern book."
2,WOW! Could this be any worse?,"So so so very sorry to have to say this, but I just tried watching this DVD and it has to be the worst concert I've seen. Yes, I agree with the reviewer who said you cannot hear the vocals at all. I get the feeling that the girls must have been having trouble with the sound system that night and this could account for their not looking exactly overjoyed at being there. Why they would still release this concert on DVD is beyond me......the producers should have used another performance with better sound quality and a bit more enthusiasm! Belinda fidgets and pulls at her clothes when she's not standing with her arms at her sides, very weird performance. Not much to see here, kids....not much to hear either. A big disappointment from a band I love so much! :("
3,This DVD makes me feel old...,"I'm sure that many of you reading this review, like me, grew up with the GoGos. They are an important part of my being. I honestly wish that this disc had demonstrated to me that the GoGos have grown with me into adulthood, but alas, as a band, they have not. As a ""Time Capsule"" video, it serves it purpose well. The classics are well played, as are many of their more minor tunes. But my overall impression is that not only the ENERGY (which they were famous for) lacking, but that they have outgrown each other.There is a fragile tension between the bandmembers (especially Belinda) which gives me the impression that a couple of the ladies really don't want to be there...The closing number: ""I Wanna Be Sedated"" by the Ramones, is a feeble attempt at regaining the glory that was once the GoGos. If you are a diehard fan, like me, you will need to purchase this DVD. But be warned... your mortality is at risk."
2,The Go-Go's Live in Central Park,"I'm sorry, the group just doesn't have major league talent. The best part of the video is the film work. Good editing, good lighting, etc...and so on. Unfortunately, Belinda and group lack any vocal desire, timing, or team work. I liked the video only for the memories. They are almost OK as musicians, but not quite. All in all, you are paying a Big league ticket price, for a group who at best, might have been the cream of the minor leagues!KJS (DVD concert critic extraordinaire)"
3,Required reading,A real snore. Serves great as a door stop or paper weight. Could probably be used to hit an intruder with.Required reading.
5,Is this the CBS Special taped at Kodak Theater?,"If it is, Celine fans are in for a treat! The CBS special captures the Celine we know and love, performing many songs from ""A New Day Has Come"" while mixing in some fan favorites (""Beauty and the Beast"" feat. Brian McKnight!)as well. She sang a movie medley of ""Because you loved me"", ""My Heart Will Go On"", and ""Beauty and the Beast"", and a few covers- ""At Last"" and ""Nature Boy"". Celine ended the special with a beautiful version of ""Nature Boy""- which included photos of Rene-Charles, Celine and Rene together as a family. I was lucky enough to attend the taping of her CBS special, and I can't wait to see Celine on DVD... She's back and better than ever!"
4,From Radio City Music Hall,The CBS special for A NEW DAY was from Radio City MusicHall and featured as guests Nsync. I believe this is the one.In the audience you can see actresses Jane Seymour and Sophie Marceau on two closeups.I taped that one on TV but accidentally erased over it.
1,Who wants to wait?,Who wants to wait for a DVD - or indeed pay in advance for a DVD that says it will be released in 2010? 7 Years of patience.
4,WARNING SHIPS WITH WRONG COVER ART,"WARNING -- I BOUGHT THIS ITEM RIGHT HERE ON AMAZON AND WANT TO WARN OTHERS THAT THE DVD INSIDE DOES NOT MATCH WHAT IS BEING ADVERTISED ON THE COVER. THE PEOPLE SHOWN ON THE COVER ARE NOT IN THIS DVD AT ALL. THE COVER SAYS STARRING JOHN HOUSEMAN, HERALDINE FITZGERALD, MARIA TUCCI. NOT SO I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE COVER ART IMAGE IS FROM, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS FROM SOME OLD MOVIE, BUT WHAT IS BEING SOLD HERE IS A FILMED STAGE PLAY PRESENTED ON THIRTEEN WNET NEW IN 1976 AND DOES NOT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE WHAT IS SHOWN ON THE COVER. PERHAPS THERE WAS SOME LAST MINUTE LEGAL PROBLEM PREVENT THE PUBLISHERS FROM SELLING THE VERSION THEY ORIGIONALLY INTENDED AND THEN AT THE LAST MINUTE SUBSTITUTED SOME OTHER VERSION INSIDE THE BOX BUT KEPT THE OLD INCORRECT OUTER BOX ART BECAUSE THEY WERE ALREADY PRINTED. I JUST WANTED TO PUT THIS OUT THERE TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE HAS ANY COMMENTS OR INFORMATION ABOUT THIS."
3,Karate Chopping Fun,"This toy is very cute and has funny phrases. My kids got this for christmas and they do enjoy it, but like others have said, Sandy seems to always be the big winner!"
5,"Good lamp, good price",This is simalar to another floor lamp that we have. The older one cost a lot more. This one is just as good. Easy to adjust direction and height. Great deal!
4,'Round and 'Round,"Though there is a lack of specific focus with the 10-track collection, it is a decent sampler of Davis from 1955-1970.The 2-disc set clocks in at 98:25 and covers a huge landscape - acoustic (Two Bass Hit, Love For Sale, Blues No. 2), the first studio recording of the departure from the acoustic quintet (Circle in the Round), experiments with at least one amplified instrument (Teo's Bag, Side Car I, Side Car II, Splash, Sanctuary) and the electric sessions from early-1970 (Guinnevere).The circle may be too large for some fans, but the selections make the smorgasbord retains good focus when the electric experiments take center stage."
3,"good idea, good product, poorly executed","This product is a great idea. And it works fairly well. I have a few problems with it. The User Interface (UI) is a tad complicated. Alarms should be intuitive. This one is not. You absolutely need the instruction manual. In the morning, when it is still dark, and the alarm goes off, you won't know what buttons you are pushing. There are so many of them so close together. Sometimes I hit buttons and I don't know what I'm doing in the dark. Snooze stops working, CDs are playing...dogs and cats living together... Maybe I'm an idiot. I don't know. I just want an alarm clock that is more intuitive."
5,Its the little things,"What can you say? The guys at Sony somehow know what little things people want in consumer electronics.The CD player, first of all will read CD-R's. Which means you can put in your own disc in there. Helpful so you dont have to tie up your favorite CD in your alarm clock.Secondly, what's the point in making a CD of music to wake up to, if it plays the same track all the time? (Personally, I mixed my own tracks using mixing software to lay mellow tunes over cuts from 'sounds of nature' sounds) Thats where the random track function really comes in handy.Its a winner"
1,Poorly made,"Don't waste your money. The material balls with the first washing and there is no flap for the zipper at the top, which ended up scratching my son's neck when it flipped up."
3,"Nice design, poor build quality","Pedrini has a real knack for making small kitchen utensils which are just the right size and weight- very useful BUT poorly/ cheaply made.If I had remembered that Pedrini made the kitchen tongs I bought....well, I would not have bought these.Now, they are better made in a utilitarian sense than any of several (2-3) other pasta tongs I have, but they are some kind of coated metal: once through the dishwasher or a single scrub with a kitchen sponge, and they are done for.So, buy these if you are willing to coddle them, or can live with them lasting a very short period of time...or just getting shabby very quickly.Until Pedrini stops using lightly coated (painted?) metal, I will not buy *anything* else they make."
5,tongs,"these are pasta tongs. you grab pasta with them. pasta is a noodly substance made from wheat and eggs that is served with a sauce usually made from tomatos and spices. Tomatos are a fruit grown on a vine and picked when they turn red, ya moron"
2,Gloria Estefan Live Concerts,Will there be any DVDs on Into The Light World Tour and Homecoming Concert? I still really love that concert..I love Evolution too..but I hope they would produce DVDs for those Live concerts..
1,Bias writing,"Books like this really make me sick. First of all, all this series does is gloss on the highlights of Biblical stories. Which in itself is okay, kind of like a cliff notes for the bible (just extended). But what it does in so doing is draws people into a life philosophy by giving them propoganda rather than all the facts of all the atrocities that the Bible contains (e.g. the approval of rape & mass genocide, just to name a couple). Anything that is so slanted without providing that this is merely mythological stories of allegory & metaphors is really not giving the reader an accurate base."
3,good for the dough,"For molded end cables, they are nice. one wire had a poop connector out of eight wires.........for the price, I can live with that."
3,didn't cut it for me(but that could be just me),"These cable are economical for a reason, I'm kinda use to pro level 1/4"" cables but these were ok, I might just be having problems with my mixer inputs because only one plug from this cable seemed to work. If I had the receipt I probably would have sent them back."
4,Great for recording,"Nice to have LR cable for my drum machine to my MobilePre. Working just fine. However, I have had Hosa products before and their longevity is questionable. But so far so good."
2,Not a reliable source,"Kent Hovind is not a scientist, biologist, or archeologist. He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material."
2,Test your cables when you receive them,"Make sure you test your cables as soon as you receive them. I ordered two, one was bad. I didn't test the second one until after it was too late to get a refund/replacement from Amazon. The one that works is great, I'd still buy them again, but I'd test all of them as soon as they arrived."
5,what a gal!,"I'm sure most people will agree with me, Mandy Moore isn't your typical pop star. First of all, she's too articulate, preternaturally articulate, in fact. Second, she seems grounded, unaffected by all the hullabaloo surrounding most celebrities. Most celebs invite attention to themselves and then later complain of lack of privacy. Mandy just moves around like she's just happy being where she is. And that shows in this video. If I had a daughter, I'd encourage her to make Mandy a role model."
3,Anonymous & James Jennings ...,If you like a book that wastes litle time on plot .. character development .. story line .. then THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU ...The story is great and deals with a young man who gets invited to a very boring summer retraet in Victorian England by Maude Helen and Alice ... Mother and daugthers ... .. FYI Alice is the teen virgin in this book ...Needless to say our hero Jack certainly falls into place quickly ....
3,60's Technology,"I first discovered the Rascals when I listened to their first album 'Time Peace' on an 8-track tape player back in the late 60's. Somehow I recall that all of the original tracks were in stereo. I was dissapointed when several of the tracks on thie best hits compliation were in the original 45rpm single 'mono' format. Don't get me wrong, these guys were a tremendous act in the 60's and 70's and listening to it brought back lots of good memories. Unfortunately, the quality of some of the tracks left a bit to be desired, as they lacked the 'punch' of a stereo recording. Good thing I got a good deal on it."
2,"Good music, horrible sound quality",My excitement quickly turned to disappointment upon hearing a recording that sounds as if it was transcribed from a portable cassette player with a hand held microphone.
1,Received the wrong telephone,"When the item was received, it was the wrong color. So I returned the wrong telephone and the Rose one is on back order and there is no ETA on it. So my account will be credited and I will try to see if it is available at another time. I must admit that I was disappointed because the phone is for my granddaughters bedrooom at my home. But I do understand.Sincerely,Anita S. Smith"
3,These are beautiful but are definitely NOT Clark Kent,"These are high quality, very beautiful glasses. BUT I was specifically looking for bigger, which is what I think of when I think fo Clark Kent, not just the shape. I believe the measurements said they were 2"" x 2"", which they definitely are not. So, if you are looking for a beautiful pair of glasses, normal size, these are definitely perfect. But, if you are looking for that new, oversize style, forget it."
3,Good....but not good enough,"The relationship between Pilar and the last Sinclair Brother, Sebastian, was good but not good enough. I mean they barely got time for romance or to really know each other. Just a few conversations and discussions and finally romance a t the end of the book. I liked the action in the book but I think miss Wilson could've done better at the beginning of the book. It was ok ,but I think she could have put the real Elizabeth, the earl's wife, her own personality, at that of the virgin-spirited girl and innocent that appears in this book to that of the gambler's mistress, a women of the world and independent that appears in My Lady's Dare."
5,Finally found my fav diaper bag,"Finally found a bag i love. I have a mini collection going, trying to find the best one....2 skip hops (which I still like) and a coach diaper bag. This has the best combination of features. I love that its stylish (the picture doesnt do it justice). Its not screaming diaper bag- in fact, it looks nothing like one. The weight of the bag is nice and light--even when packed full. I love that the fabric is wipeable and durable. The strap is adjustable so depending on your height, you can adjust to wear on shoulder/across body, or just throw it over the stroller handles. The pockets/compartments are perfectly planned out for diapers, snacks, keys, sippy, etc. Only gripe is that the changing pad that comes with it is a bit bulky and takes up a lot of room-no big deal, I just switched it out with another one I had on hand."
5,"Great acting, great movie","I watched this movie because of Sara Gilbert, wanted to see her in a different role from the wise 'Darlene' of Roseanne, she was amazing playing Sudie, very touching issue, Gossett Jr. is magnificent, what a great actor.! was worth watching."
5,Best of the Best,"Mysteries of the Ozarks is a must read for those seeking stories of the region and those looking to read quality literature. These tales will send chills down your spine, make you laugh, and most of all will keep you turning pages. It is the best of the best when it comes to ghost story and scary tales."
2,Didn't fit!!,Ordered this because I thought it fit all toiletsbut unfortunately that wasn't the case.I couldn't use it at all.
4,"So Far, So Good...","Saw this kit at my local Walmart for $10 and figured it could solve my toilet issue. The old fill valve kept making noises and the water would trickle, even after numerous adjustments. Put it in, after a not-too-difficult install, and it's working nicely. In response to the reviews that mention that this only lasted 6 months, or a year or two for them, I figure at $10 and about a 30-minute install, it's not worth complaining too much about if it only lasts that long. We will see how long it lasts. In the meantime, I'm enjoying the quiet toilet!"
4,quick and easy to install,"So the thingie that hold that floatie-thingie in my toilet broke off...so you can tell by that language I have no idea what to do with plumbing at all but figured I'd try to fix my toilet myself and I have to say that with this kit it went very quickly and easily. The only time consuming things that I had were having to drain out the tank at the back of the toilet before I installed this and that has nothing to do with this kit. I was initially concerned that I might not have ordered the right size for what I needed but it fit perfectly and it seems like it would fit in basically all non-frou-frou-super-fancy-stylish type toilets. (You know, the ones that make you think ""Wait, is that the toilet?"")Buy it if you need to replace any of the innards of your toilet tank.Don't buy it if you have a non-standard toilet."
1,Funeral Director Shirt,"The shirt was oddly shaped, it did not fit in the bust or the arms...I have NEVER had a shirt fit so strangely before. Would not recommend the shirt to anyone."
4,Genuine Corflexs Medic Air Pillow,"My original review vanished into thin air, but this product is convenient, inflatable to disired comfort and strap makes it ideal for open back or scroll back chairs. Purchased for airline use but use it every where for that tired back time. And if nothing else one can use it for a ""floatie"""
3,I think the reviews of this are inflated,"First of all, the photo is different from what I received. There are NOT any two creases down the front which control flow of air or add stability. What you get is one bit air pillow, and when you lean back on it, the air waffles to the left or right, depending on how you lean. That said, it IS somewhat useful, once you learn to let almost all of the air out of it, and it does have a good strap which, thankfully, manages to stay onto the back of my computer chair. If the other reviews were not so overweaningly (unfairly good), I might give it four stars, but the difference in the picture and the actual product is disturbing. Not as good as advertised, thought still useful."
3,Back Cushion,My wife had back surgery. We got this thinking it would help relieve some of the pressures that our car seat put on her back in places that made sitting uncomfortable. Getting it inflated properly (not much air) is tricky and we are still looking for a way to fix it in place so that when she gets in to the car it doesn't slip to one side and become very uncomfortable.
4,Spiritual Formation class textbook,This commentary has enough theological details to satisfy the curiosities of experienced lay bible students. At the same time it is nicely organized for use as the main textbook of a spiritual formation experience that involves participants doing a lot of reading and contemplating. I am presently using it in a Sunday morning adult bible class as one of my own teaching resources.
2,Not as comprehensive or unforgiving or challenging as McGraw-Hill's GED (full book),"I had gotten ""McGraw-Hill's GED"" complete study book (that massive book that combines everything) and was impressed at how much it included. I did incredibly badly at Math, so I thought getting the ""Top 50 Math Skills"" would be better for me.I was disappointed first of all how thin this book is in comparison. I took the pretest and got a 92%. I seriously doubt I am that good at math. A lot of the hardest questions from the big book aren't in this book. Also, in the big book I got around 40% at the Pretest for my first attempt, and then a 60% after some studying. I believe those scores are more accurate.In conclusion, I suggest you buy the big book ""McGraw-Hill's GED"" because it covers a lot more and will be better at preparing you for difficult math."
2,Good For Honor Students,"I like the book and the author is very knowledgeable, but I thought it was too formal a presentation for my students who are struggling. There is another book called tutor in a book that offered more support but I don't know who sells it."
2,My Review,I found this book veryyyyy boring. I didn't do much with this book. I just wanted to see some stuff about inventions. Baddd idea. I hated this book. Only read it if you LOVE SCIENCE!!! Some people will like this book but I didn't.
5,Awesome!!!!,"Every single song is awesome!!...The best songs are crank me up, t-shirt and panties, and nasty grind. Adina Howard is hot!! I saw the video for Nasty grind a couple of nights ago and almost had a heart attack..lol...this CD is amazing i would reccomend this to anyone (except my mom...)"
5,Looking for inner mysteries revealed?,This is the book to read to learn about the Golden age of Aquarius and how you can transform yourself and the world around you into your higher self. Just open this book and let Saint Germain teach you. The words will transport you to higher realms.We have waited many lifetimes to read this book and now here it is for the taking. Run with it!
1,Buy The Coleman Version,Coleman makes a similar product with better quality and for less money. Model No. 841.337
5,So glad to find this.,I saw this band several times live when I was living in Texas and had always wished I'd picked up a copy of their album when I had the chance. Thanks to the power of the internet it seems I've gotten a second chance.Great songs and great talent. If you ever get a chance to see them live do so.
3,RAM notebook memory,For somse unknown reason one of the brand new chip (sealed in the box) does not work (fale the test). Did not contact the company. Don't know what to do with this purchase.
3,Good True-Crime Read,"Growing up in the area this book is based on, I knew the basis of this story before I read 'Murder in Little Egypt': a doctor with dark secrets, who killed his son(s). Since my Mom is addicted to true-crime stories, she served as my source of true-crime books, like this one. I had to read this one myself to clarify what I'd heard about this story.'Murder in Little Egypt' was an excellent read. It seems well-researched. It uncovers a side of people that is rarely exposed. It makes it even better if you are familiar with the area, southern Illinois, and the people involved in the book."
5,Excellent True Crime novel,I couldn't put this book down. The story was riveting with many twists and turns. O'Brien paints a great picture of the time and town this story is set. Definitely a must read for those that enjoy true crime!
2,Poorly Written,"I have read dozens of books on programming languages and tools and this is the worst that I have ever used. The book is very hard to follow, the examples are incomplete and require significant additional research to completed. I would not recommend this book to a beginner, they will become very frustrated."
1,Borrowed Time,Bought this for my 12-year-old daughter for Christmas. The watch stopped by the end of February and batteries were not to blame. For nearly $20 we are left with a few beads on a string. At least we didn't trade the Island of Manhattan for them!
5,A Must Read for Those Just Starting Out.,"When I got out into the ""real world"" at age 21 I was a financial wreak. I didn't know ANYTHING! I spent and spent and spent and when I realized that the my bank account was nothing like my parents I knew that I had to get help.I heard the author give an interview about the book on a local morning talk show and it sounded like the help that I needed.I've read this book cover to cover twice and have often used it as a reference tool. This is a great book...well written...and brimming with useful pertinant information. I've recommended this book and have actually bought it for a friend that was financially lost."
1,Nothing new or relevant to 20 and 30 year olds,"This is just a repackaging of Beth's old book. If you want 100 web sites, there are many places you can find them without having to buy this book. In fact, financial web sites will supply them at no charge. Sorry, Beth, but you're now middle aged, so get a new job because you no longer speak for those of us still under 35."
2,Buyer Beware,"I brought this for my eight year old for Christmas,she began to play with it around Feb.she was having great fun with it until it began to freeze up.I took it back to the store in which I had to wait 1month till one came back in stock,took that one home did great for two weeks,same thing happened again.save your moneybuy something that will actually work for that kind of money."
5,Inspired!,"The book gives insight into the ancient traditions of Hawaii. It motivates one to respectfully learn more about this most special place and the sacred practices of Huna. Whether Hawaii is to lead us into a new consciousness is still unknown...however, there's no doubt at all, after reading The Secrets & Mysteries of Hawaii -- A Call to the Soul, that the inhabitants of these islands were/are an intensely spiritual culture and have much to offer those who are open to receiving such wisdom. Thank you, Pila."
3,Interesting,book I like the Hawaiian philosophies and it was informative. It also caught my intention story wise. . . .
3,It's got an ok taste.,This product tasted so so to me. I love apples and sparkling drinks but I thought that this was just ok tasting not mind-blowing. It is a decent price for a pack of 24 so I would recommend it.
1,item never received,Company charged my credit card even after they confirmed that they will not ship the product.Even after a followup promised by the company i have never receive any news.really disappointed with the way they treat the customer
3,Deceptive advertising,"When the descriptions reads: This product is compatible with SD, MMC, MS Card and jump drives and includes the following accessories: remote control, AC Adaptor, USB Cable and AV CableWhat it really is saying is: This product has no built in memory and so doesn't work at all unless you buy some for it, but we're not going to tell you that so you get order something else after you wait two weeks to get this."
3,Could be better resolution,"I was a bit disappointed in the quality of this enlargement. Not to typical photograph standards, a bit grainy. However, we framed it and hung it in my son's shark-themed bedroom and you really don't notice that it's grainy unless you are examining it closely. Excellent packaging."
2,Only for ages 4-6,This item is very limited. I bought this for an 8 year old and my 5 year old is almost too advanced for the activities.
5,It is just Perfect for my 5 Years Daughter,"I was looking labtop for my 5 years old daughter as she keep busy with our home computer. I found this on Amazon and it was in great deal that time. We had one from Target but when I got this on great deal, we returned the one we already bought after we verified that it is the same item.She gets busy with the new labtop and it has a lot of games and learnng activities."
3,V. Smile Nitro Notebook,"I purchased this notebook for my 45 year old downs syndrome brother so he could practice his numbers, etc. The screen is very hard to see and you have to place a lamp close by at a certain angle to view it. He seems to like the item and feels proud when it congratulates him. He has only been using it for a couple of days. He might get better with it as time goes by."
2,Too Old,"This publication came out in 1995 and most of the air rilfes and pistols reviewed are out of production. A lot of good basic information is there, but if you are looking for up to date information this book is not for you. Also, the prices of the airguns are not listed. And all the reviews are old. Too bad, because there is not a lot of good and up to date information on air guns available. They need to publish another edition."
2,A let down,"James Babb's River Music was great but Cross Currents, after a nice opening, is just another travel/fishing book. I was disappointed."
2,Save your money,"I have to say I was disappointed with this video, just Luke walking around in a big house interviewing people and some of them are getting freaky with hatchetface girls.There's not really anything to get excited about, and this is supposed to be the best of Luke's Freakshows!Don't buy it!"
5,It will save your bumper!!,"Bought this b/c I recently purchased a really expensive car and didn't want to keep guessing the correct position or bear the guilt of putting dings in the bumper if I guessed incorrectly. So far so good...It works perfectly. I ordered this versus the laser devices since I need to back in, so there would be no way to position a laser to hit the dash with the garage door overhead. I positioned the LED light unit on the back wall at a height that allows me to see it in the rearview mirror. I pull in slowly, it flashes green at 5' than yellow at around 4' and finally red at 3', and I'm done parking. Perfect alignment each time. The sensor is positioned a foot lower, so it allows forward or reverse parking. With the GE name, I expect this thing to last a while."
5,Handy Parking Device,"Sensor works great. Easy to install, no electrical cords to hide and looks clean on the wall. Sensor takes a few seconds to engage during approach as long as performed at a slow rate. Not designed for speed parking."
1,Did not do what I needed it for.,Just not what I wanted. I have a long narrow garage and no place to put in so it will work.
4,Enjoyed it very much,I enjoyed reading about the very beginning of professional hockey. It was very entertaining and I learned a lot.
1,Does not list ingredients,I can't rate the product on taste. Ingredients in the product description said only salt and spices. The complete ingredient list includes rosemary which I am highly allergic to. I wasted my money.
4,good vibes with depth,feels innocent with bittersweet cornersbright colors minus saccharinremember before you had to work and pay rent
2,disappointing,"beautiful girls and scenery but impossible to understand the audio and much too short, only 25 minutes."
1,Well...,"I bought this DVD thinking it was the original band. After I ordered it I read that it was just Dewey Martin & Bruce Palmer.I enjoyed hearing the Buffalo Springfield Songs. The singer had a Neil Young sounding voice, so the Stephen Stills songs didn't sound right. The 2nd song ""I Am a Child"" was my favorite & if you close your eyes you can imagine Neil Young singing it, the singer sounds similar to Neil.The lead guitar parts sound different but I was such a Springfield fan that I enjoyed listening.Oh, by the way. Bruce Palmer always faced away from the audience. In the oncore on this DVD he's finally facing foward.A real reunion would have been nice, but I believe Dewey Martin recently passed away."
4,Relaxing family entertainment,"As a family entertainer, I listen to, and sing along with, the Three Stooges as I drive to each gig. The light-heartedness puts me in the right frame of mind to entertain. The alphabet song is a good warm-up exercise for public speaking. I have about 6 favorite songs on the CD, and usually skip to those. Who would have thought they could sing??"
5,Can they sing? Why coitenly!,"I take a lot of long car trips with my daughter, and Barney songs get old really fast. I've always loved the three stooges films, and I remembered the Alphabet Song, so I figured I'd give this album a try. Imagine my surprise when we both started singing along with it!The songs on this album are a mixture of kid's classics (This Old Man, Old MacDonald), old time tunes (Peggy O'Neil, The Merry Go-Round Broke Down) and witty tunes disguised as nonsense songs (Mairzy Doates). As for the stooges, no they don't sound like the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, but so what? They sing in tune, but more importantly they genuinely loved performing, and every jolly note they warble is filled with that love.I can recommend this album to anyone with kids (don't worry, there's no slapping or eye-poking). I can also recommend it to adult stooges fans (if that's not a contradiction in terms). It's fun, it's catchy, and its better than a poke in the eye, nyuk nyuk!"
4,How to explore your desire,"Kloster in ""Forms of Desire"" give us all the beauty and sensuality of Fetichism. Divided by themes, all different forms of love and sense are represented by situations where the woman is the focus. She uses black and white photos to increase our fantasy. All the forms of desire are allowed and Kloster show us a range of them bringing to the reader the choice."
5,I love this cd!,"I love this cd from NKOTB its a great dance album. I used to have this album on a cassette form when I was teenager and it even sounds better on a CD format. This cd is so hard to find in stores and used record stores as well. I saw them with the BSB last year near Chicago for the first time and they put on a great show and I met one of the members too Joey McIntyre in 2007 nice person to meet. If anyone loves dance music you'll abousoluty love this cd. I highly recommend it to any NKOTB fan our a fan of dance music. Its definily a collectors item and its a must have as well. You won't been disapponted, NKOTB you guys rock, every song on here great and they are different versions from the regular albums which I like too, its interesting. Buy this Cd. love it!!!"
4,Very good remix album!,"This was a good remix album that New Kids On The Block put out during their hugely successful period. They toured during 1990 and 1991 at a relentles pace, selling out everywhere to promote their Step By Step album's songs. Perhaps the funkiest of the remixes is Games, which is catchy, funky hard hitting enough to confront their toughest critics and naysayers! Sounds very close to the siren/tornado sounds of rap group Public Enemy! Another standout is the C+C Remix of Call It What You Want, which also ended up on their Greatest Hits album in 1999. It's just as danceable and funky today! The other numbers like Hangin Tough, Step By Step and other rare remixes are just as good. This was a huge jump for them to get off their teen pop image for a second!"
3,Just OK,"I bought this to use at work and no one is very happy with it. It does not keep coffee hot for very long and is slow as molasses brewing. The coffee will stay hot for about 1/2 hour, then only stays warm. For the money, I expected better. My Black & Decker I use at home is much better. The timer is easy to set and works well."
4,Great !!,Some sections are hard to understand but this book is about taxes and for the most part they have done a great job of laying things out in a sensible fashion and do a good job of not only explaining how it works but also why the rules are set out that way.
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"After buying two horrible copies of The Eve Arden Show and Our Miss Brooks Vol. 1 of the TV series, I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity and sound of the ""Whistling In"" trilogy. They were normal dvd quality and I'd recommend purchasing them as they're very difficult to find on dvd."
1,Trash,"This is really a piece of trash and that's where it is going. Amazon advertised the ""unrated"" version"" sent the ""R"" version. Really dissapointed with Amazon. Don't waste your money."
1,Horrible idea,"I'd no more keep a live fish in one of these things than I'd keep a cat in a shoebox. Yes, both would fit, and neither would be humane. If a person wants a tiny, decorative object for their desk, they should get a knick-knack, not a pet."
1,Death Trap,"This 'tank' is a good way to torture and kill a betta fish, and nothing more. It is laughably inadequate to keep a betta in - or it would be, if animal abuse wasn't involved."
1,Not accurate,"My husband and I tried this thermometer but were very disappointed. After taking my temperature several times in a row and having a wide range of final temperatures (some were as much as 2 degrees apart), we felt that we could not trust it to give us accurate results. In comparison to our very cheap, digital, oral thermometer (which was very consistent), the forehead scanner also seemed to give lower overall readings. For the price (and the uncertainty), this thermometer is definitely not worth it."
5,vvin,Excellent movie which i highly recomend. Very good acting on all of the characters involved. A must see for any vin diesel fans.
5,EXPERT POP-MEISTER -- AND THOUGHTFUL...,"This album throws you for a loop, so to speak. It is not the WHAM George and it is not the FAITH George. Instead, it is an elegant, almost symphonically enhanced pop record of confessions, desires, and bitterness and pain. It is absolutely self-involved, but with a pop master like George Michael at the helm, the songs become universal cries and whispers. I do love FREEDOM 90, which is saucy and infectious -- but my favorite is SOMETHING TO SAVE, which is plaintive and poignant and honest. This is my favorite George Michael album, and one, by the way, that shows off his gigantic vocal abilities in spades."
5,This is the best book on Malcolm's ideology! Buy it!,"I first started teaching myself about Malcolm X when I was only in 6th grade, but I was only really concerned with his life story and not his ideas. The books I had read up through high school never gave any extra insight either (and I owned 10 at the time). I first read this book in the fall of '95, finding it by accident when I was going through the books by Malcolm my freshman year at Montana State U. This book is terrific! I had always been an admirer of Malcolm, but without the insight and this book gave it. My favorite speech is ""The Black Man's History"", truly a masterpiece. There are some ideas that don't quite pan out, but these speeches came during the time he was still with the Nation of Islam and a follower of Elijah Muhammed. This book gives terrific insight into his ideas early on. It is well worth the money to buy this book!"
5,A Lesson in Craft,"In this story of a man torn between cultures, choices, and identities, Palmer does an amazing job of continually upping the stakes for James Reese. A series of events--the escalating dangers of his job, his wife's pregnancy, and the death of his birth mother--come together to force him into a harrowing examination of his past. Palmer presents an utterly convincing male narrator whose difficulties are both global and personal. James is a character who will remain in your mind long after you've finished the book.Furthermore, Border Dogs functions as a beautiful example of how a novel should be written, combining an almost thriller-like sense of tension with a precise yet lyric style. Palmer is both a writer's writer and a reader's writer; her novel is not only a page turner but a lesson in craft."
4,Wilbur Smith as good as ever,Follows on from When the Lion Feeds and continues the gripping saga of the courtney family intrigues in developing S Africa.The Sound of Thunder (Courtney Family)
4,touch pad,"The pad works well and helps my son to study, or review different subjects. I like the way you can unhook the top and put it in your lap or use it seperate from the base. He would like it better if it was in color. It does give him a variety of things to do."
1,Not worth the money!,"This is more for a kid who is 4 or 5 years old NOT 8-11 as it states.Talk about a waste of money. I returned this the next day for a refund as my 10 year old daughter would have been so upset with me had she received this under the Christmas tree this year.It was a shame the description wasn't more accurate, because I was not refunded my expedited shipping costs I paid for this ""TOY""Thumbs Down"
3,for x box,I bought this for my grand son and then found out his x box is broken! I guess I should have asked first.
4,Great fun,"I just rented this game using gamefly, btw you should use them if your not, and it is awesome. The gameplay is really easy though, I only played maybe 4 levels and the main boss's were super easy, this is a really fun game."
1,Stay Away (either because you loved the original or hated it),"If you loved the original, you'll probably hate this. If you hated the original, you'll almost definitely hate this.I loved the original Boondock Saints. The plot of this sequel isn't horrible, but the dialogue is some of the worst I've ever heard (it doesn't even compare favorably to the type of movies they run late at night on Cinemax).It's hard to believe that this film was written by the same man who wrote the original. In any case, if you dive in, prepare to be deeply insulted."
1,Horrific!,"Seriously. This film is nothing like the original. NOTHING! It is atrocious, horrifically written and so low budget that it's disgusting. The director, producers and everyone else involved in this film should be kicked out of Hollywood for good. This movie was a disgrace. I was anticipating this movie for well over a year. I am so disappointed... I'm disgusted. Why does Hollywood allow such great movies (like the original Boondock Saints) with garbage sequels such as this?"
2,Troy Duffy ruined a perfect opportunity.,"I am a true fan of the first Boondock Saints, having said that I loath Troy Duffy. For all the fan boys who will cry foul because the creator of such an amazing first movie could do no wrong in you eyes, think again. For further clarification go watch ""Overnight"" it is a documentary following Troy Duffy and his cronies while producing the first film. It becomes apparent immediately that he purely got lucky with the script and directing in the first movie. This is abundantly clear in the second film as typical cliche direction and piss poor comedy fills the screen. Duffy tried to be ""creative"" in some scenes, and it is obvious that he tried to hard. IF and when he makes the third movie he should really goto film school first."
1,"If you haven't seen the first one, you might actually like this","....but if you're a die-hard fan of the first one, you will wish the brothers double-tapped you to put you out of your misery!Recycled jokes, overuse of the prayer finishing move, and two of the most cartoony characters ever seen in a movie (the Mexican fighter and the lady-detective). The movie even jokes itself (the ambush-planning scene).The movie is just a joke. And one of the brothers is just so Botoxed out of his mind, just to add insult to injury.But, if you've never seen the first movie, you may just actually like this one.Otherwise... you've been warned!"
2,First was better,"This movie left me with a lot to wonder. How can you make such an amazing first movie, and come up terribly short the second time? I thought that after all the years between the movies, they would come up with something a little better than this!!"
1,WORST sequel,"This is possibly the WORST sequel i have ever seen in my life. I LOVED the 1st one so much i actually gave the DVD as gifts to several people. This ""all saints day"" mess plays like someone else wrote a ""parody"" sequel. I really had hopes for it. Troy Duffy is a giant ego maniacal tool bag who got lucky with the 1st one, this one totally fell short."
3,LETS HOPE A #3 TAKES THE CAKE,"THE MOVIE IS NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE AND THE ACTING IS JUST AS BAD! From Julie Benz who played Dexter's wife on the show Dexter on Showtime who was all soft and sweet in that, to a hard ass sexy detective with a really bad southern accent in this flick. The action is ok, but the rest of the movie i really fell asleep to. So i watched it again and it was just as bad as me nodding off the first time! The plot is pretty weak, The acting is horrible including the seasoned actors, This movie isn't worth buying, its better to redbox it with a promo!GOOD LUCK"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Loved the original...hated this one. There is not one redeeming quality about it. Flanery and Reedus must have owed somebody money. It is just horrible. I was thinking of getting my thesaurus out and find more synonyms ""bad"", but nobody has that much time."
1,What a flaming piece of trash...,"I absolutely love The Boondock Saints, so I was super excited about this movie coming out. I remember leaving the movie theater in total confusion, just wondering how Troy Duffy could have made such a wretched movie. It's like he didn't even try. Every aspect of the film was either a thoughtless rehash of something from the first movie, or he just stole it from the generic action conventions box. This was a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE movie with lame dialogue, predictable plot devices, and absolutely none of the quirky originality of the first film. I hope Duffy dies and goes to hell for this."
4,Ths is truly authentic Lebanese cooking!,"Growing up in a Lebanese family, I really liked a lot of the foods my mom made, but I couldn't figure out how to make them because she puts a little of this and some of that. This book is great! The recipes come out just like my mom's, but there is no guessing on my part and they are in smaller portions. The neat thing about Lebanese cooking for me is that it is so healthy. There is a wide variety of recipes and if you really wanted to know how to make tabouli and hommos, the author makes it so easy to do so. I use this book all the time."
3,Fans will find it interesting,"If you liked Spirit you will like this dvd.It's an outdoor concert with no interviews or other talking heads, all music.I wish the guitar was louder in the mix, the sound seems better than you might expect but still not like state of the art.California on guitar, Cassady on drums, John Locke, oddly enough on bass since this was after the fergusan/andes departure.He does those great Mark Andes bass parts perfectly. So,not the full band you know from studio work, but RC looks pretty young and they are doing songs from Dr.Sardonicus.A couple of songs really work, like Nothing to Hide, Got a Line ..the new songs are forgettable.As I say, if you liked Spirit you'll probably like this.Too bad a dvd of the full band hasnt surfaced."
3,Be careful,Be careful with these wipers. I bought two of them for my 97 passat wagon. The driver's side works great. The passenger's side leaves a big spot on the middle of the windshield that it does not clean of water or anything else.No idea why - blade does not seem damaged. Only thing I can think of is for some reason the bow in the middle of the blade just does not straigthen out for complete cleaning. So be careful when you order.
4,Holdup suspenders,I am a old customer of Holdups and I have found their products perform as advertised. The reason for 4 stars is that the colour was dark (indigo) blue and not as shown.
3,Happy with DVD,Happy with DVD. Would advise to do more research when purchasing. Happy with quality of product. Overall OK. Would purchase again.
5,BUY IT NOW!! -- AN ORBITAL FAN MUST HAVE!!,"This DVD compiles the footage and audio from one of the best artists of their time. They compleatly reconstructed the way electronica was. Their performances at the Glastonbury were legend and now you can see and hear them on a collection of 3 (count em) 3 discs! The 2 audio cds include alot of their best songs and some you are yet to discover, (Some of which have some interesting improv integrated in them.) The DVD is all of the live footage of the songs. Put together in a sort of mezmerizing way. If you love orbital this DVD is a must have for you. It transends their Legendary music with live footage that (for some) is a memory on hard-copy. Cheers to Orbital!"
4,AWB,Great download and sound quality is as good as the original album. It takes me back to 1976 which was fun.
3,Won't work without the booklet but otherwise nice,"I thought I was getting a phone my 5 year old could take with him and have fun quizzing himself with but it turns out it's useless without the booklet it comes with which is fine if your child is sitting down with the phone and book as a fun project on a rainy day but if the phone and book end up in different rooms, forget about it! Also, the book is fun for the child but if the child can't read yet and isn't sitting with an adult, it's again useless since you can't play the games/do the quizzes without being able to read the answers and press the corresponding number on the phone to put your answer in. We should be able to hear the questions from the phone and then hear what numbers to press for which answer we want to choose, if that makes sense."
3,Pretty good movie,I thought this movie was a good movie. It was all filmed in Utah which is were I am from. In fact the highschool it was filmed in was my highschool and I am in the movie (in the basketball game). Anyways it is good so go watch it
5,brings back memories,i saw this movie when i was in jr high and i'm now 24 and i still love it! it arrived super fast and in great condition.
5,"Comical, Touching and Very Entertaining","""Wish Upon A Star"" is a movie my husband and I saw on TV and liked it so much, we wanted to own it. It's a pleasure to watch a movie without profanity. ""Wish Upon A Star"" made us laugh while letting us look into what it truly means to ""walk a mile in someone else's shoes""! When we want to watch something entertaining, funny and touching at the same time, we watch ""Wish Upon A Star"" yet another time."
2,McCall Misses,"In ""The Return"", Dinah McCall just misses in giving her readers a satisfying story. Somehow, the plot just lacks that certain McCall magic.Set in the hills of Kentucky, we read about, Catherine, who returns to her city of birth. Trials & tribulations over mean-spirited people almost overwhelm her. There is not much intrigue or fully developed characters. I do commend the authors message of how hurtful gossip & such can be.When romance writing is at it's best.... we expect rich, full, textural images and characters that make our hearts soar. Hopefully Ms. McCall will ""return"" with one soon."
4,A little different from my normal reading picks,Sharon Sala seems to like the mountain people of Kentucky and West Virginia and can make their lives and stories very real.
4,One for the Romance Lovers,I have been a fan of Ms. Sala's for some time and this was one of her older books. The mystery and romance are interwoven with the heroine and her love in an entertaining way. Best kind of book to read and enjoy.
3,I prefer the older series,i like the older series with pat chambers & lindsey bloom as velda it was the best i hope they come out with it in dvd
2,A lukewarm documentary on Lang,"This documentary simply did not grab me, it is very slow, andTo me, it had several flaws. One, it is mostly in French and German, so one can not just sit back at watch it, you must read the subtitles, second, this film does not have a main narrative, something I really like to see in a documentary, I think it helps to move the story a long. The documentary is soley commentary The last drawback is the lack of information the viewer is provided on Lang's life. It seems to just skim over his life's highlights with out going into very much depth. The one good aspect of this film is it provides a nice visual look into Lang's films, but that is about it"
3,A forgotten future...,"If you read the book description you get the idea of the story - it is a commentary on humanity. What exactly are mans inalienable rights? How much authority do corporations, or organizations, have over humanity? Should our rights, whatever they may be, be sublimated for the ""improvement"" of the species, or our collective circumstances?The book definitely raises some interesting points, however the story is a bit too overdramatic at times, and unrealistic at others. The love story would definitely be an example of the latter - where the main character is willing to travel through centuries of time to test a ""love at first site.""I enjoyed the book and the questions it raised, but I would not go so far as to say it was exceptional. It is worth the read."
1,Eric The Animal Ripp Off!!,You talk about running you past into the ground! Eric is very sad to watch!Too much Booze and The Animals? What Animals? Its a pick up band! youngmetal guys....
4,Great series,Good chapter in an interesting series. I like the fact that that focus is on the job and the challenges it has in addition to drawing on past episodes in his life so that it show his influences and the consequences of past actions. Also the writers have a secret agenda of persons unknown that gives it some mystery. The is he gay or not storyline has moved from being amusing to annoying however. I will buy further issues - it is more than just beating up the villan of the week - there is a broader context missing in other graphic novels.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Mayor Hundred is getting pretty stressed about doing this whole running a huge city thing. First, the weather has turned very bad, which an extremely bad storm leaving the city snowbound. To cap that off another killer is running around bumping off snowplough drivers, of all people.It is tempting to break out the superpowers when something like this happens."
3,"Don't use for 12"" tiles","I bought this at Home Depot and took it back the next day. If you are installing 8"" tiles then this cutter would be ideal. It barely fits 12"" tiles and the cutting guide gets obscured so you can't reliably make cuts where you want. It also has a tendency to crush rather than cut the edges. I had to resort to using a large pair of snips/scissors (only $17)."
2,A definite change,"I completely disagree with the other reviewers. This EP is way too polished for my tastes. This seriously sounds like an attempt to cash in on the whole ""emo"" thing. Granted, they are more sincere and better songwriters than 99% of the bands in that genre. But still, I loved their heavier, rawer stuff...it's their perogative to go this new direction, but I don't have to like it. Dead Reckoning has definitely been their high point so far. Pick that one up and work backwards."
1,Will not fit.,"This basket is 1 1/2"" too narrow for the Go Lie.I tried seven ways from Sunday to attach this thing.There is no way.Seller does not want to refund either."
2,2pac love,"It was an ok vid. If your a 2pac fan then its a must to see cos its from people who really knew him, his homies. I didn't like the home footage style film it looked a little rough. They could have had more pics etc. of him, as you get a little lost through it ! It's not the best video of tupac but thats cos hes not in it"
2,2pac Thug Immortalz,"Hey do not buy this !!it is the biggest waste of money ever, the picture and sound quality is real bad!! Its just a cheap way for people to make a buck out of 2pacs name.It is rather degrading to see what people would do to earn a bit of money, Tupac was all about quality and he would only want his fans to get the best, WHICH IS NOT THIS DVD!!"
1,Did not Like,I am an ETERNAL Tupac fan and this video is about 85% interviews with people who KNEW him and 15% Pac! I would have rathered it be the other way around.
4,"Excellent Acting and Mood, Less than Good Plotting","My wife has read the Wallander stories but I haven't, so I can judge these three episodes only on their own terms -- and the verdict is decidedly mixed. On the one hand, Branagh seems perfect for the lead role -- his emotions kept in check until compulsion overcomes control and he snaps. All the supporting actors are well cast as well, and their performances excellent. The direction is exquisite, and the mood a mix of patient endurance and tense expectation. And all these things -- the characters, the setting, the mood -- are enough to offset what is for me plot lines that hinge too much on coincidence, chance and oversight. If you need your story to be seamless and air tight, this disc will probably make you tear your hair out. If, on the other hand, you are drawn to atmosphere and character, this will be a very nice ride. The choice, as they say, is yours to make."
1,sad,"Loved the first series but this is mostly WAY too violent, way too depressing. The acting of course still superb, the setting as well, so if you can stomach the black outlook..."
1,Bored To Tears,"By the time I got to this episode, after watching all seasons, I was so sick of all the abject misery that can befall one human being.....jeeeze.....Its all about him and all his MISERY, what an absolutely depressing show. Very sad considering the talent Mr Branagh has, but one can only take so much selfcentered misery. I feel like I need a HUGE hug and some therapy LOL."
5,Hilarious Hilarious Hilarious Hilarious,"I don't normaly read this kind of books but Chris Rock has changed all that. This is the most Hilarious book I have every read.I never seen Chris on stage but if he can write like this I am sure he is Hilarious his stage as well. I have read the whole book in one go without puting it down, believe me it was that funny."
4,Typical Chris !!!,"Chris Rock's ""Rock This"" is typical Chris. Some might be pleasantly surprised by the insightfulness of his wit but that may be overshadowed by some of his blatantly vulgar observations. Chris writes on crime, race, love, marriage ... sex and sex. You can see those bright eyes and hear that loud, grating voice screaming at you through the hard cover."
2,"If You've Seen His Stand Up, Dont buy this.","If you've ever seen Rock's stand-up, which i'm sure you have, don't waste your money on this book, unless you feel the need to own a written transcript of his act. That's all this book is, his act on paper. Don't get me wrong, I think he's incredibly funny but there's nothing new in this book. It's all the jokes from his act, pretty much word for word."
2,Loose connection,"I bought these cables to extend my full sized Grado's from my computer to the couch for watching movies.The cables and the sound they produce are what one would expect with one deal breaking exception. When I plug my Grado's in, there is wiggle in the female connection on these cables. If there is even slight movement while listening, sound gets cut out altogether, or one of the channels cuts out. It is very annoying to watch a movie and have to hold on to the connector to avoid that wiggle. I feel I can't even move when watching a movie.To rule out that it isn't a problem with the Grado jack, I plug them directly into my 1/4 cable input on my computer. When I do so, I get a healthy ""snap"" with no wiggle or sound cutting. I tried multiple 1/4 jacks and all have the loose wiggle once plugged into these cables. SO its the cables.Now, I am not sure if these cables in general are all bad, or I just got a bum one."
2,Weird,"Weird case, strange book. Karen Kingsbury had never become a novelist: she has no ability to create depth of character. Therefore Missy is a one-dimensional saint and her killers are demons. Actually, all of the characters in this odd tale were quite unlikeable. And those re-created conversations are clumsy and unrealistic. But this book, I will admit, is a page-turner in the way that the Jerry Springer show sometimes fascinates me against my will: I kept thinking as I was reading, 'Do people really live like this?'"
4,Good Product,"Very decent quality for the price of the adapter. I used this adapter to connect my amplifier to my iPhone. Sound quality is alright, I'm not sure if it is my amp or the adpater. I would buy again if I need another cable or adapter"
2,Disappointing,"I bought a cable made from the same manufacturer, and ended up having the same problems with it as I did this adapter. After a while, the connector became loose, and my right channel would drop if I didn't get it seated just right. Fail."
2,Sound OK loose connection,"I have had these adapters for a few weeks now and I can't say much good from them. The 3.5 mm headphone plug will not remain in place. Simply holding the jack upside down will result in the plug falling out. FYI this issue occurred within the first few days of use with BOTH adapors!Sound is decent, but the connection is so flimsy that one can't even move while listening to music.I guess you get what you pay for....."
1,Not useful - degrades sound quality and volume,"The Hosa 3.5mm to 1/4"" adapter is not useful at all. It is cheap, works, but leads to quite a lot of degradation of the sound quality and the volume level. I don't use it anymore as the built-in speakers of the device I am using it with provide a louder and better sound than what I get when I connect it to external speakers via this adapter. I would not recommend this item."
4,Cheap and Adequate Adapter,"This adapter is perfect for casual audio use. The build looks and feels solid, and it just works. No interference whatsoever. This purchase was a very good value for the money."
5,great,Transfers the stereo audio. Awesome stuff. Using two. One for my left and another for my right speakers. (Using a sound board) buy with confidence!
5,Works fine so far,"I've had the adaptor for about a month and it has held up great so far. I haven't put it through extreme conditions (plugging and unplugging many times),but it seems well made and definitely worth the price."
2,its ok,It's okay i guess. It didn't really help me though that much. The Diagram not so much either nor the CD. kept it anyways though since it does somewhat help.
3,beautiful feeder,"This was a beautiful feeder...for the first few days. THEN the squirrels conquered it. The hook was not strong enough to endure the weight of the feeder, squirrel and full of seed and crashed to the ground. Solar lights no longer work. After many a trial and error, my husband strengthened the chain and hook so it no longer falls. We still use it. :)"
5,Excellent gloves,"We ordered these driving gloves for my husband whose skin is quite sensitive to the sun. They work perfectly--are soft and, very importantly, comfortable to wear over many hours of driving. I would recommend them to anyone--you will not be disappointed."
3,Nice but don't fit,The gloves are very nice but don't trust the Amazon sizing chart. Order the next larger size.
5,They're great!!!,"Very thin so you really can do other things while using them. Even though they're thin, they still warm your hands a little, so it was perfect for me."
1,Gross taste.,"Could not take it. For the taste, I recommendCarlson's lemon one. Cannot feel the fishy taste at all."
1,Thoughtless Design,"While the TEAC SRL50 is without a doubt one of the best sounding CD-clock-radios in the under $200 price range, I would not recommend this product to anyone. The unit produces such an annoying hum in standby mode, we could not stand to keep it in an adjacent room, much less on a bedside table.The most amazing feature of the SRL50 is that the unit does not display the time when playing the radio or a CD. You have to press a button to display the time, and then it is only shown for four seconds. What's the point of having a CD-clock-radio that doesn't display the time? With this product, you will need to buy a separate clock."
4,Well built. Great sound!,This radio is a beautiful and stylish piece. It has very good bass response and clear sound. It is also very heavy (13lbs.). Overall: VERY GOOD!
1,Not Worth The Time or $$,"Our TEAC CD player stopped working and showed an error message.There was no explanation in the manual, so we contacted TEAC.TEAC said it sounded like the laser was shot so to take our unit to an authorized dealer.I drove to the authorized service center listed on the TEAC website.Gone. Closed.Out of Business and for some time!Then TEAC said to ship it back to them!As if I still had all the packaging.I am not getting any help or ""Customer Service"" from this company.The responses from Teac's Factory Service Department are curt and useless.I am done. Would anyone like to buy a broken CD player? Ha"
1,Dated and not useful,"As other reviewers have stated, this book (published in 1907) is so dated one wonders how it is even still in print. Perhaps the only value is the author teaches you about tuning the piano using the slower beating 4ths and 5ths method (once the main method, aural tuners now predominantly use the faster beating 3rds and 6ths method). However, even this method is explained cumbersomely by the author. The section of repairing piano parts and regulation is anemic and terribly short considering the complexities of a piano. Poor illustrations with an antiquated writing style, this book is best left in the dustbin of piano literature."
4,A Continuation of My Father's Dragon,"A continuation of the lighthearted fantasy begun inMy Father's Dragon, in which the dragon delivers Elmer to his home after their adventures. Throughout their journey they meet similar challenges as in the first story -- a storm that maroons them, a riddle to be solved on an isolated island, and treasure discovered. Elmer's homecoming (bearing gifts for his parents) is heartwarming, although he never tells the secret of his adventure.It would be better for his adventure take place with his parents' knowledge and blessing, but this is still an exciting, interesting and funny story excursion."
3,Good but received some interference,"We have only tested this item due to our baby arriving next month. The unit charged well, but we had to play around with the channels due to the first channel's pick-up of occurrence in an unknown house in our neighborhood... A little concerned that perhaps they could reciprocate and hear us :-("
3,okay but needs more velcro,If the flap had a bigger piece of velcro to hold it shut it would be perfect. Its too easy to open as is and a little tug would allow the contents to fall out if you put the camera down. They put plenty ofthought in securingthe pouch but very little in securing the lid for the pouch.
1,DID NOT WORK; NOBODY CONTACTED ME,"BAD PRODUCT. DID NOT WORK. ALTHOUGH I EXPECTED SOMEONE TO CONTACT ME OR TO SEND ME THE PRODUCT THAT WORKED, I HAVE HEARD NOTHING. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN. YOUR COMPUTER SKILLS ARE OKAY, YOUR PEOPLE SKILLS ARE NOT.DR. GREENSTONE"
2,List of better products on the market now,"This was an OK product when I bought it a few years ago. The hand crank only gives power for about 1 - 2 x the time you crank the handle. For example, crank for 5 minutes, and you get about 5 - 10 minutes of power. Also, the reception for AM is a little below average, bad for FM, and non-existent for Weather. Not bad when it was first introduced years ago, but very substandard nowadays.I've been doing a lot of research on the topic. Here are the three top rated radios with dynamo that I could find. Make sure you get one that can take batteries if the crank fails.CC Observer wind-up emergency radio (Black)Etón American Red Cross ARCFR160R Microlink Self-Powered AM/FM/NOAA Weather Radio with Flashlight, Solar Power and Cell Phone Charger (Red)Sangean MMR-77 Emergency AM / FM Portable Radio"
1,Bad design and poor quality,"Italian design used to mean quality. It also used to mean that the product is made in Italy. None of this apparently true.The strainer handle is made as the single shaft, it was poorly welded on to the rim and already loose and rotating, right out of the box.Mesh bowl was flattened and disfigured on one side. It was not the result of bad packaging, as I first thought, just bad quality.Italy (as wel as France, Belgium, and many other European countries) have no law that mandates to show country of manufacture on the product. If item is made in Italy, it would proudly say so. Otherwise, it says nothing. This strainer is obviously a very cheap export at a very high design price!Although I returned it the day I received it and did not use it, I think that decorative plastic handle makes it unsafely unbalanced.The only reason I gave it one star, because I had not been give ""no star"" option."
1,Horrible,Even using a crossover I blew these guys up at 20 watts MAXIMUM... and they sounded terrible at really low volume. Not even worth 5 bucks.
5,Finally i found AR for PSone,ive been looking for it for a long time now.now i can use it to help me with my old PSone games!!!
2,Not Terrible-But Not Good,"My father had viewed this years ago and remembered it being excellent. We just got it and it is not. The sets are horrible. It must have been filmed with a budget of about $1,000 or less! The camera quality is horrible and the actors are pretty bad except for Hawkeye, Cora and Alice. The Indians are terrible. Uncas is a little nerd with an English aristocratic accent and Magua is pretty dumb too. All in all it is pretty bad. The Massacre at Fort William Henry consists of about 5 women! Would not recomend, unless you want to laugh at something very dumb."
1,This was the worst version I have ever seen,The acting was second rate and the sets were even worse except for the few outside scenes. I thought this BBC Masterpiece Theatre version was absolutely awful.
4,Wolverine Strikes Back,"Well, I actually didn't play it I watched my brother play it. Well, he got mad when he couldn't beat Wendigo. He also pointed out that Professer X looks like one of those Roswell Aliens. He also pointed out that the guy that did Magnito's voice is the guy that plays him in the movies. Sabretooth just gets on your nerves. Ladydeathstrike is like the main boss of the game. When you beat it you see Sinister and Apocalypse talking about arrangments to make Sabretooth a Horseman, it confusing because it also shows pictures of Wolverine. Omega Red is Loose."
4,GREAT,it is a great game filled with action you yuse stelth tactics and fight your old arch rivel sabertooth it over all is a great game i very much sugjest you rent or buy this game!
1,Did not receive,Seller was out of country so I did not receive this game. Seller was quick to respond to my order to let me know he could not ship giving me plenty of time to order another gift
1,defective item,I sent the item back. I was still charged for it I also was charged shipping to send it back. I will try to get in touch with them
2,"Works, sort of.","I own an earlier model of the iTrip and loved it. So when I purchased a new iPod Classic and needed another FM transmitter I went right to he Griffin iTrip. Well, this one doesn't work nearly as well as the older model. It looks very cool but it just doesn't have the same strong clear signal as the old model. It' works, but there is a lot of static and noise. The slightest bit of signal interference causes it to mess up the music you are listening to. I need to search out a better solution as this one just doesn't work well enough to suit me."
3,Bad urban transmitter,I picked this up on clearance for $10. I live in an urban area and the reception is pretty horrible most of the time. I have yet to experiment with it in a place with more than 3 or 4 clear channels - the best ones have static for both the channel above and below.I figure I got what I paid for.
2,Mediocre,"Bulky and doesn't fit with a case on the iPod touch. Very low range - needs to be right next to the radio or antenna to work. However, it is easy to use."
1,DONT BUY,This thing gets no coverage. Complete waste of my money. Dont buy one unless it actually hooks up to your car.TERRIBLE investment
3,may not work if you have a case,"The reception quality depends where you are. In large cities it can be difficult to find a station to listen on.The other problem is that it must mount flush with the base of the ipod, so if you have a protector case it may not be able to make the connection on the bottom. This should be stated up front in the product description."
4,Beats listening to the radio!,"The iTrip was just what I needed to get me through a 3-hour drive to the beach. Now that I'm back from vacation, I use it all the time--even on my 10-minute commute to work! I can't stand listening to the radio and fumbling through CDs is too much work. The iTrip was perfect for me!"
2,Contact problem Dock Connector for iPod,I usually have problem when I try to turn on the dock connector for iPod. I need to try some times to turn on the FM transmission.Now I'm living in Brazil and I don't have technical assistance here
2,Okay but,"When the empty FM station is truly empty, the unit works okay. But when it isn't, it doesn't. And going up and down hills, you hit blind spots where FM echoes around and a station will bleed into the Ipod audio. It's really annoying, and makes the device less than useful."
3,Works Good,"The transmitter definitely worked well for the first few months. After time, I heard more static each time I used it. Bought a car with an auxillary hookup and haven't used this since but if you don't have an aux hookup, this is the next best thing!"
3,Not Impressed,"Overall I'm not impressed w/this iTrip. I used to have a 4Gen iPod w/the Griffin iTrip that mounted on the top. I loved that thing, quality was good and it never got in the way. This transmitter however sounds worse and falls out of the dock connecter any chance it gets. If you try to use international frequencies there is a constant hum in the background. I finally found a US frequency that works descent but I still get ocassional static here and there. It is alot easier to use though. I will continue to support Griffin but I think they just dropped the ball on this one. Look for the iTrip Auto or Roadtrip instead."
2,griffin itrip,I bought 5 griffin i trips.the griffin i trip was listed as new and I received 5 used ones.they were defective and I tried emailing them and they made it a hassle for me to return them.I was really dissapointed with this seller.
1,Not good signal from unit to radio,"Transmission is very static and I was unable to make this unit work. It's a great idea, but I had too many problems with it. Don't know how iw works in different trucks...but this unit failed on a F150.Good luck."
2,Not Impressed,Purchased this unit for my Daughter. It seems to work OK as long as you do not mind listening to what sounds like a distant FM station with all the static and hiss.I think a cassette adapter works better and that is not saying much.
1,Have come to expect so much more Griffin,"Had a Griffin itrip for my 3rd generation iPod and loved it. The 5th generation unit looks really nice but is a very poor performer. Low audio drive, noisy, the connector constantly falls out. The transcient that comes out through your car stereo if you tap the back of the unit is quite alarming. I find that I am constantly repositioning the unit to optimize against interference. I replaced the unit with a Griffin RoadTrip (yes, I gave Griffin another chance). What a difference! The roadtrip performace is solid as a rock and the sound is crystal clear. Roadtrip must put out more power because I get no interference at all!"
3,World of Cats,"THE WORLD OF CATS is three 30-minute episodes of ""Safari,"" a shot-on-video nature television program hosted by John Ross. The programs were produced 1998-1999.The first episode is titled ""African Cats,"" in particular the lion and leopard. The second episode is titled ""Mountain Lion,"" and is about the large North American cat. The third episode is ""Sumatran Tiger.""Per usual in nature shows on predators high on the food chain, most of the time is devoted to stalking, pouncing, killing and eating. Ross provides the voice-over narration and appears in a couple of cut shots per episode, prowling about the tall grass, binoculars in hand.The photography is uniformly good, although about half the Sumatra show deals with gibbons and other leaf eaters. Perhaps because of the elusive and solitary nature of the Sumatran tiger. The only ""drama"" in this disc occurs when three gray wolves steal a deer kill from a cougar. Otherwise it's pretty much stalk and eat.Harmless and a little educational."
2,Dont Give DD So Much Credit,"I would give the book one star but because of the ridiculous nature of the attacks on the author I'll make it two.End of Blackness is simply a bad book. It is bad, bad, bad. I'm not sure how it got published in the first place but here we are. I leave it to readers to figure out for themselves. Why then do reviewers here feel the need to make personal ad hominem attacks on the author's domestic life. You're only falling into her trap and in a perverse way proving the ""point"" of her poor confused crappy book."
1,I agree with the others,"I, too, purchased this potty (its predecessor, actually) for my son some time ago. We have been trying to train him and I am almost to the point of giving up on training because I can no longer stand having to dismantle the thing every time he pees! I have to first unhinge the cover, remove the basin and clean out what little has not leaked out of it, then put the potty itself under warm running water. WHAT A HASSLE! I am going tomorrow to purchase a simple potty with no bells and whistles that will be easy to clean regularly."
3,sturdy cable but . . .,"Works great and appears to be sturdy but the 1/8"" end is very wide and won't fit into a few things. Namely my iPhone."
4,Best and cheap,"This product is the best way to hook up your iPod to a a speaker system. First of all its very cheap and second of all it is easy to use with great sound quality. The only bad thing I can say is that the base sound isn't perfect when it has to come through the wires, but its there and can be amplified. Overall its a good product for a much lower price than the rest of the iCables, although they all offer the same performance."
1,help me,"does the lastest version of AR contain cheats for resident evil 4, please also send me a list of the other games it has cheats for..."
3,"Action Replay for GCN, Failure?","I bought this last month mainly for Animal Crossing and Sonic Adventure 2: Battle but the preloaded codes for it stink, SA2B didn't have any preloaded codes to change the chao's color or strengths and the memory card for it had only enough space to hold the Animal Crossing Data, Nothing else, you can't even save your NES game data from Animal Crossing on the puny memory card, but anyways this is still fun. I unlocked Punch-out on GCN with Animal Crossing it rocks. (...)it's not worth it and the keyboared is hard to control when your entering the codes on-screen. I suggest buying the company's GCN keyboard to enter the codes and the LARGER memory card from the official site."
1,Very unreliable,"First off, this doesn't work with the wii. It turns on and allows you to add codes, but when it's time to exchange disk's that's where the problem lies, as the game disk doesn't launch. The other problem is that this product no longer works for my gamecube, despite having no scratches, and my Gamecube is also in great condition. I am very dissatisfied with this product and don't want other people to make the same mistake of buying it."
4,Informative,"This book is informative and very easy to understand! I love all the information about each type of houseplant. Plus, now I know how to propagate and make my houseplants look the best they can."
2,not worth the money,"Don't pay over $10 for this toy - it LOOKs like a lot of fun, but in reality, you can barely make out the images when used at the beach or sandbox. The material is flimsy, so little people hands often easily destroy. You're better off using your imagination, your hands, and creative containers!"
5,Rare and beautiful.,"Liliana (Virna Lisi) is a struggling young model with an insatiable desire for success. Liliana becomes famous by falsely claiming to have been sexually assaulted and robbed., becoming, as a result, a 'celebrity' at the center of a whirlwing. This new status su0ercharges her career, leading to an out of control swirl of sex, booze and hard partying.Virni Lisi was one of a bevy of exotic women (Sophia Loren, Gina Lollabrigida, Jeanne Moreau, Brigitte Bardow) who dominated European cinema during the 60's and 70's. These women filled the gap for U.S. audiencies longing for the departed Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield.The Doll That Took the Town is a surprisingly good period piece in a rare film rapidly disappearing from the market."
4,Great for traveling,"We got this seat for our 11-month old son for our 1st family vacation. It folded up easily and was quite portable for the road trip. Our son enjoys sitting and eating in it. He especially likes to put his cup in the outlined cup holder. From the 1st use, he was able to pull off the top tray. If we can angle a corner of the tray under the table, he can't budge the tray. Otherwise, it's fine without the top tray."
5,This is a great booster seat!,"My son is now nine months old, and uses this chair exclusively for feeding. It is extremely sturdy and well made, cleans very easily, with no nooks and crannies for food pile-up, and is very easy to transport.We love the fact that it fits on our kitchen chair, and slides right underneath the table when we're done, so there is no extra room taken up in our kitchen by a big highchair. The green cover-tray is also great for keeping the food tray clean between meals.My son is also very active, but loves to sit in his chair, and between the straps and the tray, he is very secure (but NEVER leave your baby unattended anyway!).As long as your baby is able to sit up to eat (before that you can just use a bouncy seat anyway), you really don't even need the highchair."
4,can use some cushion on the back,"I would like to give this product 4.5 stars.It is very easy to install and secure.It is very easy to cleanIt can be folded and carry to restaurant, friend's home or to a park.One thing I would to see in newer model is that the back is cushioned with pad."
4,Good seat!,"We picked this instead of a high chair because we have a pub height table and we couldn't find a high chair that was tall enough and easy enough to clean so our daughter could ""sit at the table"" with us. This works great! Our daughter HATES the tray for some reason and pushes herself away from the table with her feet as a game, but that's not the fault of the seat. We are considering a clear vinyl seat cover for the chair though. Without the tray, food ends up all over the dining room chair. Great solution for a pub height table though."
5,great toddler seat,"this is a great seat that won't break your budget. i only bought it for my daughter at the 15 month mark so i dont know about before then as the back rest is rather short but it works great for her now and fits perfectly tucked in under our table so that you hardly even notice it and there is no bulky high chair to worry about stashing. the chair is fairly easy to clean and the trays go right into the dishwasher. the tray doesnt disengage from the chair easily so at least so far, she hasnt been able to get it off although she can lift out the eating tray on her own (not that easy to do)"
4,Great for a travel option or extra chair,"We bought this because we are going to grand parents and friends homes who don't have a high chair. The price was right, and it folds down to a pretty portable size, about 2 large shoeboxes or so. I much prefer my keekaroo for daily use at home, but we leave this one in the car trunk and we are always ready to go. It's also nice when we have friends with kids over, we already have an extra chair for them."
4,good product -,"Pros: nice sturdy seat, plastic sections easy to clean. The colors are ok. protable. very handy. infants, toddlers find it comfortable. Cons: not sure how to clean the latches and fabric seat belts. not has cool looking as some of the other stylish items. Overall: good product. will use for baby number 3."
5,Great Seat!,"This seat is light weight and sturdy. We bought it for our 6 month old daughter and she loves it. She not only eats in it when we are on the go, but she also sits in it to play. Very good buy for the price!"
3,Kind of small for toddlers,I was looking for something a little bigger for a 3 year old when I got this. It's not very big and he will probably outgrow it soon. Also it sits kind of low even on the highest setting.
5,Better than traditional high chair,"I wish that I had this chair when my other son was a baby. It makes my son more at ease to sit and eat at the table with us, doesn't take up any extra space and it's sturdy and holds up to the wrath of a baby :)"
4,I'm really glad I bought this chair,I bought this chair for my grand daughter's visits to Grandma's house. I'm so glad I did. I fits perfectly on my dining chair and allows my grand daughter to eat at the table with us. This chair is very secure with no chance of wiggling out. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that I wish the back rest was taller. She sometimes hits her head on the back of the chair when she gets excited.
5,recommend,A couple of my family members have the booster seat. Plus it had high rating so I decided to purchase it. The description of the seat is very accurate. I recommend this product.
1,Baby pulls the tray right off,"I'm not going to write a very long review because there are already over 700 hundred reviews for this product. Based on those reviews I bought this chair. My 11 month old daughter was in it for less than 5 minutes when she pulled the top tray right off, spilling the food onto the floor. I replaced it and she promptly did it again. I would suggest holding on to your receipt, if your child figures out the tray trick then return the chair, if not-- enjoy!"
1,do not buy this terrible seat,"We purchased this seat for our daughter when she turned one. Seemed like a great option and was inexpensive. After a while, the back of the seat continued to pop off. That was so annoying. We began noticing a bruise along my daughter's lower back at her spine. It would slightly fade and then come back. I became so worried that it might be cancer until I read online that it might be the hard plastic seat pressing on her lower back. As soon as we replaced the seat with the Prince Lionheart Booster Pod the bruising went away. I highly recommend the Booster Pod in place of this terrible seat. The Healthy Care booster seat is so hard and uncomfortable and not safe for their lower backs. Don't waste your money."
5,"Great seat, worth every penny","My daughter loves this seat. We have tried all others but they simply don't measure up. The quality of this chair is great. I would recommed it to everyone. I just wish I didn't waste the money on a high chair, since my daughter refuses to sit in it."
5,Great Space saver!,"I was pleased that the seat raises up and that it has 3 trays. Very nice. I'd much rather have this one so our grandson can sit at the table with all of us instead of being in a bulky high chair. PLUS, you can take it to go! LOVE IT!"
5,Great travel chair,"I bought this for my grand daughter. My daughter visits often and I don't have a high chair and she doesn't have alot of space in her kitchen for a large hi chair. My grand daughter can sit this just about anywhere and she is safe... It's really easy to clean and folds up for easy carrying. Wherever she goes, she has a chair for her daughter that is safe..."
4,Great,I bought this seat in response to the reviews here. I am not disappointed. It is a easy set-up and my grandson looks comfortable in it. Easy to clean too.
4,Great product,"Bought two of these for twin grand babies. Easy to clean and use , only drawback is the twins are starting to get to big for any of their chairs."
5,Great!!,"My son loves, loves, loves this booster seat. He now sits ""AT"" the table with the whole family and feels more included. It is an added plus that he is safe and secure in the seat with no worries of him sliding out of his seat or tipping over. He is 14months old now."
3,Ok chair. hit or miss,"Bought it hoping my son would like it. He likes it ok. He likes to sit on it when i place it on the floor, but my son whined after short period of sitting on this chair so I ordered Lipper International 516C High Chair, Cherry for $35 from amazon after testing it out in different restaurants (it's virtually in every restaurant)so using this instead.At 7month old my son figured out that he can pull out the different layers of the table and he started to do that everytime i sat him in it"
3,Not quite as practical as it looks,"This seat was nice to have, but I will not be using it for my second child. It is bulky and not as convienient as it should be. It was such a pain in the neck to carry around and took up to much space in my trunk so I would remove it for grocery shopping or something and always forget to put it back in when I needed it. I am a server in a family restaurant and swear by the seats that attach to the table like the Inglesina Fast Table Chair. That chair in particular holds up to 33 lbs. and is very secure and easier to transport. Also the easiest way to get the Fisher-Price chair clean is to put it in the dishwasher, but again that takes up alot of space. With the table chairs, the covers can be removed and put in the washing machine with out taking up the whole washer load."
5,Nice alternative to a high chair!,We got this chair when my son was born. We already had the Healthy Care High Chair (which I highly recommend also) for my daughter. We decided to get the booster seat for my daughter and give my son the high chair instead of buying another high chair (my kids are not quite 11 mos apart). What a good investment! It's nice to have something so compact to take places with us if need be. My daughter can sit right up at the table with us and we can strap her in (a must--or else she's on the table!) My only complaint is that the tray insert pops out to easily. I gave up trying to use it because she pops it out and the food goes right on the floor! Other than that it is great!
5,Great product,My 6 month old daughter loves this chair. This chair is very practical and perfect for our small apartment. Its one less baby furniture to move out of the way. Its very easy to clean and we can take it with us when we go out to eat. Again perfect.
5,Great for Grandma's house!,"This little high chair works great at our home, plus it's so easy to take it with us. I would recommend this to anyone that needs something and doesn't have a lot of room to store a bigger one. It actually could even take the place of a big one. Very pleased with this purchase."
3,Serves it's purpose. Good deal for the price.,"I am happy with the booster seat. It was easy enough to attach to my dining room chair. Daughter loves it, including chewing on the straps. Becareful of baby fingers when attaching the tray. Attaching the tray can be trick since you cannot snap both sides in at the same time. One side has to be snapped down at a time while at the same time trying to keep busy baby fingers out of the way. Very easy to clean and the cream tray is dishwashable. Overall happy with the purchase."
5,"Easy To Use, Setup and Clean",My wife and I have used this seat for our 15 month old son on several trips and have found it to be a solid product. Setup is a snap and easily adapts to a variety of chairs. The removable tray allows for easy clean up and the snap-on base tray holds securely when in use. It folds into a relatively small size that easily fits on the floor in our back seat. An overall solid product that seems like it will hold up to the use by multiple kids.
4,"Good, with one major flaw","We received this seat three days ago. This morning, my 19-month-old figured out how to remove the dishwasher-safe tray that snaps onto the main tray. It doesn't clip in very securely. This makes for more mess than necessary.That is my only complaint. Otherwise, this chair is a great buy. It's quite compact (the tray is really quite small, especially if you are used to the gargantuan trays on full-sized high chairs) and easy to wipe down. The straps attach securely to a chair. The straps that secure the child to the seat are not removable, which I can see being annoying, however, since the rest of the chair is plastic I can always just hose it down in the bathtub if necessary."
5,Invaluable,"We purchased this product after our daughter was born to use when traveling. We lived overseas and many restaurants did not provide seating for children. It was invaluable. Had I known just how practical and useful it was for such young kids, I would never have purchased an additional high chair. When the kids are really little, the tray that attaches holds them in and you can then feed them right at the table. As they get older, you can use the chair just as a booster. Additionally, a feature we did not realize it had until later, was that the chair actually has several height levels to it! Great purchase and great product...definitely recommend."
5,Handy and Portable,"My five month old daughter sits comfortably in this seat. We use it when we go to someone's house or to a restaurant. It folds up nicely for travelling, and a harness strap becomes a strap to carry it. I like that you can wash the food tray in the dishwasher and that it has a cover for when you're travelling or when it's in storage so the tray stays clean. It is a well made and well thought out travel booster seat that I highly recommend."
5,I LOVE THIS ITEM!!!,"My mom bought the Fischer-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat to have at her house when I would come to visit with my kids. I loved it so much, she bought me one also. It is the perfect seat to take to a restaraunt or friends house when you are unsure if there will be a high chair or booster seat available. I have attached it to a seat as well as an outside bench (at Sonic). I have been using it for 2+ years now for both of my young boys (1 year and 2.5 years) and it is still as good as new."
4,Great for Grandma's House,"We ordered this booster chair when we decided on a last minute trip to Grandma's...the first time after the baby was born, and Grandma and Grandpa didn't have a high chair. What a nice, compact but sturdy feeling seat. It was easy to attach to the chair, it was easy to clean-both the tray and the chair itself, and it was a great height for my petite daughter.And, it's nice and compact to store when you're done. I suspect we may buy one for our house when we're done using the full sized high chair.Thumbs up."
5,Why Didn't I Think of This Earlier????,"I recently purchased this for my 15 month old daughter and I wish that I would have bought this much earlier!!! We had previously lugged our full-sized highchair to family member's houses and I wish that I would have had this. It is fantastic! It is portable, durable, and adjustable. It is convenient to keep in the trunk of my car so that I have it where ever I go. Highly recommended and a great gift idea for any new or expecting parent. A MUST HAVE!"
4,Portable high chair works well!,"This portable high chair really works well for when my grandson visits! It's collapses small enough to store in little space as well.I love the fact the food tray is dishwasher safe. Makes cleanup a breeze.My one wish would be for the ability to tilt the front legs up a tiny bit higher than the back since, when strapped to a dining chair with a cushion, the front can lean forward a little, though this is easily offset by just placing a folded towel under the front of the high chair."
5,Awesome,This is a great product. My son go to the point where he didn't want to sit in his highchair anymore. He wanted to sit at the table with his mommy and daddy. He loves sitting in this. We also take it with us when we go out to eat. It is much easier than having to deal with the restaurant highchairs and all those germs.
5,love,we have a pub table so I wanted my son up close to us. this works great. cleans up easy and I can pst him right up to the table.
2,Fisher Price Booster Seat,"This seat is awesome... However why ask what color i want if you send the WRONG COLOR??!! I asked for a certain color for a reason and ended up getting two of the same! Other than that great to take to day care, out to eat , or use in the kitchen!"
5,One of the Best Services for Digital Camera Users,"Ophoto is by far one of the best online photo services. It's an easy to use interface and great service. I used them during Christmas for some photos and they came out great. If you don't like the online red-eye reduction tool, try and use the software that came with your camera. From my knowldge, just about every camera is giving you a program like Adobe PhotoDeluxe for free. Learn how to adjust the red eye BEFORE you upload and just save the image in its native format. You have much more control this way. As an experinced Photoshop user, I can do just about anything to the photos before and the results are always worth framing. Ophoto has great cutomer support as well. Any digital camera owner should consider them as a definite resource."
2,Action-Replay....................LOADING....................,"ok this action replay sucks!!it only works with games that have a purple disc back!!but hey,if you want cheats for kingdom hearts and final fantasy(since they both have silver backs,)go to www.codejunkies.com and keep on going down list until you find ""square-soft doesn't like to cheat,but WE do!!"" and click it,buy the cheat disc and when you get it....vowla! you get 2 lists of cheats for final fantasy X and 3 lists of cheats for Kingdom Hearts!!any-way don't buy this product!!stay away!!until next time,Kenny >_< >_< ~_~ ~_~ :) :) :( :("
1,Don't buy this!!!,After I bought this I sold it in a garage sale for a buck. There's not much more I have to say about this.
4,The best game ever,when i first played this game i thought it was going to be bad. But then when i played it was excellent and all my friends wanted to buy it. But still the best game is Advance Wars 1 & 2.
3,NNNNNeeeeeerrrrrrrdssssss!!!!! Where is the 3-D?,"Yes Part 4: Nerds in love was release for TV in 3-D.So, Where is it?The rest are great.But the 3-D make a great addition to Nerds in love"
5,Sounds Decent,"I bought the 3-foot version and am very happy with it thus far. I needed something connect my laptop to my DI for multimedia presentations. This cable fit the bill without breaking the bank. The shielding isn't the thickest out there but at quite litterally one tenth the cost of the next grade up from Monster, I really am not complaining. Quality is about average. They don't WOW you but they don't feel like junk. The sound quality (especially thru a convention hall's built in PA sounds fine.) That said I haven't tested these on a bigger systems."
3,Just Average based on my experience,I have these connected to Alesis M1 320 active monitors from my Mac Mini. I also own the same HOSA cables with the RCA jacks.I did the following test. I hooked each up and noted the volume levels. The RCA jacks won clearly - louder output at a lower volume level.At least with my speakers.
3,"Good service, good product.","Good service, good product.It works well, not like the cheap Chinese metric cables that others sell( filler words to make up what this lame reviewer wants)"
3,Works Fine But Shipped Wrong Length ... TWICE!,"Ordered two of these (separately) but both came as 3ft cables rather than the 10ft listed. Had to go buy another extension to make up the difference. Cables work fine, just expected them to be longer as advertised."
2,"Bought two, only one works",I bought two of these. One works fine. Only the left channel works on the other one and sounds terrible. I'm returning the defective one and not buying this brand again.
5,Great for combining sources,"Works great for combining two single sources (mono) into a stero signal. I can't detect any degredation in sound quality. Of course it doesn't improve my sound either. Garbage in garbage out, right?"
4,Better than I thought!!!!,These shirts are heavy enough for welders and I liked everything about them til I washed & dried them! They came out sooo wrinkled that they could not be worn til ironed & I took them out of the dryer while still running!!!! VERY hard to iron!!! I am hoping that the 2nd wash & dry will relax them. When I finished ironing them they were just like HEAVY starched shirts from the cleaners! You may like this?
3,I liked it.,"Yes, it's low budget. If you require expensive pyrotechnics and special effects, you will not find them in ""Abraxas."" Yes, the leading lady could not act her way out of a paper bag. But I enjoyed the plot, the supporting characters of the 2 small-town police officers, funny scenes like 2 small-town waitresses having to serve breakfast to Sven-Ole Thorssen even though he's huge, brooding and looks just like the description of the man who's just murdered 2 or 3 townspeople. Jesse Ventura does a creditable acting job. The VHS box copy makes it sound like a a slam-bam action film, but that's not what ""Abraxas"" really is. If you're looking for a rather sweet little film that looks like people tried really hard to make something good without much money, I think you'll like it. I loved the scene where Jesse threatens his wrist computer ""answer box"" with deactivation of its vocal mode if it doesn't stop telling him how to carry out his mission."
2,Revell P-61,"This is a great model kit.....If you have the experience,and know how, to fabricate your own parts. The Revell parts in my kit are terrible as far as fit goes. The cockpit glass, both front and rear, are a joke. Both left and right side engine nacelle's have major fitting issues, and leave terrible gaps,so be ready to fill in the spaces with plenty of putty. After several hours of repair work that should not have been necessary, I have a nice kit,but, when purchasing a model kit, this many modifications should not be necessary."
4,Great mat!,"Great mat - worth the price. Excellent cushioning- better than your standard ""sticky mat"" and grips the floor very well. Would recommend buying a yoga mat towel to use with it (Yogitoes makes a good one) but I would recommend buying that for any mat for absorbency and comfort."
2,Simple world,"Life is simple in the world of Michael RuseA:1) Only true scientists are entitled to question evolution2) Creationists are not true scientists,3) Creationists are not entitled to question evolutionB:1) Only true scientists are entitled to question evolution2) Only evolutionists are true scientists3) Only evolutionists are entitled to question evolution4) Evolutionists won't question evolutionC:1) Creationists are are not entitled to question evolution2) Evolutionists don't question evolution3) Evolution cannot and won't be questioned4) Evolution is true, since it cannot and won't be questionedLife is really simple in Michael Ruse's world"
4,"Sit down stranger, have a drink, let me lighten your purse..","One of the few anthology series to work, this book comprises a series of stories by different authors all set in the same town. The town of Sanctuary is no ordinary town, as the title of the book suggests it is the home of a great numbre of people who live by nefarious means. Each and every story is a wonderful tale, introducing interesting characters.Unfortunately, while the series did continue for at least another 11 books only the next two managed to continue the ethos and wit of the first book. By the fourth novel the series lost it way and became dull reading. Content yourself with this book. If you want to, read the next 2 (Tales from the Vulgar Unicorn and Shadows of Sanctuary) but go no further for the series becomes self-important, dull and unreadable."
3,Fits but noisy,"The assembly fits well, but is much more noisy than the original. In fact, I had to turn up the radio to hear over the blower.Update. It has gotten quieter."
2,Going downhill,"This movie, Old Dogs, is two best friends and business partners, who are about to make it big with a business deal with a Japanese company. They are suddenly surprised when one of them is confronted with the children from a one-night stand. This throws their life and plans into chaos as promises are made and broken, hearts are broken and mended, and everything ends up alright in the end. Falling into the comedy genre and starring Robin Williams, I was expecting more laughs than what the movie provided. And the few laughs that were given seem too scripted; especially in the scenes with the children. Robin Williams is known for his spontaneity, and there was very little of it in this film. John Travolta seems out of place in this comedy also. Overall, an OK movie that luckily is only 1.5 hours long."
3,Disappointing,"This movie, although chock full of great talent, was a sad misfire. The parts of the movie that made me laugh were few and far between, however, when I did laugh, I just couldn't stop! There were maybe 3 scenes that were just fantastic. I can't imagine what happened to the rest of the movie!I thought the family dynamics a bit hard to explain to little ones. I thought the mother being incarcerated for 2 weeks was difficult as well. Robin Williams has never disappointed me so I thought I was in for some fun, despite the difficult family layout, however, it wasn't worth the 10 minute explanation I had to go through.Disney should stick to animated movies and leave the divorce, single guy out on the town and other such topics for the sitcoms and drama shows on reality television."
5,loved the movie OLD DOGS,"The movie was very entertaining, we laughed a lot.Well done. A little over the top with silliness but well done. would recommend."
5,Hysterical and good clean comedy!,"Robin Williams and John Travolta really showed a clean side of comedy in this movie. Frankly, after reading the ""one star"" reviews I was somewhat shocked that some did not find this movie funny! I ordered the DVD for my parents and am looking forward for them to view and provide their input. I highly recommend it for the whole family! It's really hard to find good clean comedy movies today!"
1,junk book for a good library,"clearly these guys do NOT know how to write a book, or they do not have the time to do it. this can not be called a book, only some printed pages filled with cryptic information that you can pull off the boost web sites for free.to be fair, c++ code that uses a library with generic programming and excessive type synthesis can be ugly and hard to explain. but hey, if you are given a few hundred pages to explain what going on in ONE library, you should be able to start from the basic and gradually get into the involved details. apparently this is not the case here, everything is thrown at the reader without much explanation."
4,Book of Prayers,"Missal-sized and comfortable in the hands, it's a lovely compendium of prayers for a variety of deities and occasions."
2,Not for Pagans. But for Wiccan's.,"I bought this book looking for ""Pagan Prayers"" but, like so many other books out there at this time it is aimed at Wiccans and their strict rules on how thing should be done and not on the less more traditional and looser Pagan. Then on top of that the first 68 pages are spent telling me why I bought the book in the first place things like ""why we pray"" and "" composing prayers"". Well I bought this book knowing why we pray and wishing to do just that. Next I wanted a book of prayer not a self how to book.I WOULD NOT BUY THIS BOOK if I had it to do over."
3,Good Clay Pot Cookbook - but could be better,"I originally got my clay pots and cookbook as a way to do some ""home cooking"" without having a working stove or oven. I was told that with a clay pot I could cook meat in a microwave without it tasting strange or having a rubbery texture. This is true, and I love clay pot cooking, and have found many good recipes to try in this cookbook. Unfortunately, not one recipe I have found in ""Cooking in Clay"" has microwave instructions.I have used many of the recipes by using formulas from the web, and the outcome has not been bad, but it has been sort of ""trial and error"" (with many things I will do differently the next time to improve the result). It would have been so easy to just have added a quick note (Example:""If using the microwave, cook 5 minutes per lb of meat at full power and 15 per lb at 50% power""). This would have made it a far more versatile cookbook and been much more helpful for those of us currently ""Kitchen impaired."""
1,A SURPRISINGLY SHALLOW BIOGRAPHY OF A DEEP MAN,"He was the ""last"" brother, the Kennedy who, despite a (mostly) sterling reputation and record in the Senate, will never become president. And so we are delivered yet another Kennedyana kernel, this one by ""New York Times"" reporter Adam Clymer. The book fails to capture the spirit and humanity of the man; the insights are surprisingly shallow for such a respected journalist. On the Chappaquiddick incident, during which a young female Kennedy supporter was drowned when the car in which Ted was driving went off the road, leaves Clymer writing the shocking news that Kennedy was a bad driver who ""probably"" was drinking prior to the accident! A faded rose indeed."
3,Too long,"Cute, but a little too long for regular comfortable peeling. It does work well on items like cucumbers, with the blade staying put and not turning like some peelers I have had in the past."
2,not enough excavators,"My son likes basic construction trucks: excavators, bulldozers, front end loaders. This DVD focuses on several exotic, extremely large machines found at a coal mine: a large shovel that looks like Mary Anne in Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel, a huge dump truck, and another shovel on a cable. If you want to see normal construction vehicles, get I Love Big Machines parts 1 & 2."
4,Pretty Good,"This video on ""diggers"" (small and very large construction excavators... including the largest excavator in the U.S.... called Ursa Major... ""The Big Dipper"") is pretty good for toddlers. It features a nice little song, ""I dig dirt"" sung to the tune of ""Frere Jacques"" which is very cute, especially if your toddler starts singing it. I really like that there are both boys and girls (and men and women equipment drivers) in the video, while most other construction videos tend to only show men and boys. My 2-year-old (boy) likes it a lot. However, he more often asks for ""Road Construction Ahead"" which is a video about how roads are built and has a wider variety of construction equipment (diggers, rollers, graders, etc.). And he even more asks for ""Farm Country Ahead"" which he calls ""the tractor movie"" and is in a series with the ""Road Construction Ahead"" video."
1,Didn't work for me,"I was really excited about this product. I purchased it for use in my 2001 Toyota Corolla for my G5 (video) iPod. I was very disappointed to find out that it doesn't appear to be compatible with my cassette player and/or my iPod. (The employees at my local Apple store told me it should work with the G5.) I put the tape in and after trying to ""read/process"" it for a short time, the adapter was spit out time after time. I've tried all sorts of things to get it to work, but it's a no-go for me.I've heard great reviews of it elsewhere so maybe if your car accepts it you will have better luck than I did."
5,Works perfectly!,"I'm astounded by all the bad reviews for the SmartDeck. Mine has worked perfectly from the moment I connected it to my iPod and slid the adapter into my car's tape deck. The best thing about it is that it pauses the iPod automatically when I turn the car stereo off or switch to the CD or radio, and starts the iPod playing again when I hit the ""Tape"" button on the stereo. No more having to rewind audiobooks that I forgot to stop playing when I stopped the car! The track-skipping feature also works just as advertised. The SmartDeck makes my iPod work like an integrated component of my car stereo, for a mere pittance compared to cost of a new stereo. For what it's worth, I'm using a 4th generation 40GB iPod and the original factory-installed stereo of a 1999 VW Passat."
1,Positively HORRIBLE; don't waste your funds,"To say that I've wanted to throw this *smartdeck* out of my car window countless times may be a strong indication of how poorly it works.Never have I encountered a product that works so poorly. Don't even CONSIDER owning this accessory if you live in an area of the country that dips below 60 degrees; it seems the product works even worse in the cold!Upon pluggin my iPod into the smartdeck, the adapter makes my iPod jump, from song to song, playing the first 1/2 a second of each. It's rare that I'm able to get the adapter to play the iPod normally.I will no doubt be shopping around the competition for a stronger, more reliable piece of equipment for my iPod"
1,Bad News,"I have a 2006 Lexus GS300, and this item failed miserably. The skip function did not work, and the unit randomly changed the tracks on the iPod without any user intervention. And the mechanism itself made so much noise, that when the music was set at a lower volume, you could hear the cassette mechanism turning over the music. Top that off, the sound quality provided by the unit was fair at best.Disaster."
4,It worked...,"I really liked the idea behind this product and decided to go ahead and buy it. It works in my Acura. I did have the reported problem of ""poor sound quality"". This was caused by the device saturating the tape head (Griffin should add a gain control). This was easily solved by placing little pieces of scotch tape to the cassette head within the adapter. In my case, I used three pieces. This increased the distance between the adapter's tape head and the cassette player's tape head. It sounds quite good now. My favorite feature is the deck pauses the iPod when you turn off the car. I always forgot to stop the iPod before I got this product and would drain my iPod batteries."
1,Jillian Michaels Ultimate workout,Very disappointed with this dvd set. The first dvd had no video and would not load on my computer. The other 2 dvds have a great deal of talking and instruction which is annoying to have to watch every time you want to work out.
4,The Best Packaging of Van's Bang Material,"Anyone interested in the work of Van Morrison is aware that Van recorded this material without planning for a studio album. Ironically, this work has been rereleased over and over again on one rip-off album after another. This is the only release that deserves merit. Historically, these recordings provide interesting insight into the way Van developed from the soulful pop/rock of Them into the stream-of-consciousness jazz/folk of ""Astral Weeks"". ""T.B. Sheets"" and the seminal ""Brown Eyed Girl"" stand out, but such lesser-known songs as ""Spanish Rose"" and ""Joe Harper Saturday Morning"" are what make this collection really enjoyable. Add the rarely heard ""Chick-a-Boom"",the original versions of ""Beside You"" and ""Madame George"", and an alternate take of ""Brown Eyed Girl"" and you get an important piece of music history. Avoid all other repackaging of this material!!!!"
4,great chair,I don't usually write a review but this is a very good chair. I have another one that I bought for my mom's house and since my little one isn't really good at holding himself up all the time and loves to move around it was like trying to feed a moving object (read: sweet potatoes EVERYWHERE). This one provides good comfortable back support. It also takes up very little space. I hate big highchairs...The only problem I had with the chair is that the seat bottom doesn't stay up for smaller children. I ended up putting some towels at the bottom .. otherwise it was too big for the baby.But it's the best chair out there for now.
2,Make sure it works with your table and chairs!!,"I got this chair as a shower gift; it was on my registry based on all of the great reviews. However, this seat seems dangerous to us because it does not fit all the way on our chairs (we have the wooden rounded back windsor style chairs) and it is also too big to push under the table. It is so bulky that we are planning on getting the Explorer travel chair by Chicco which actually hooks onto the table."
5,Great for Travel!,"I bought this feeding chair to go in our travel trailer so that my baby would have a comfortable place to eat while on vacation. We love it! It works better than the highchair we have at home for him. They tray is a perfect height, and it is easy to clean. In addition, my son loves the letter and number activity mat that came with the tray. The seat back is nice and high so he is supported behind his shoulders, neck, and head. And unlike many other portable feeding chairs, this one has a nice cushiony pad so my baby does not have to sit on hard plastic. The seat reclines so you can always adjust it to the desired angle. I looked at six different feeding chairs before buying this one, and I truly believe I bought the best one available."
5,Perfect for small spaces!,"I love this chair. We just strapped it onto one of our dining chairs. We used the newborn setting (reclined all the way) from the time our daughter was two months old and it is wonderful. The tray removes very easily and the reclining settings are easy to set. This was a much better alternative to the highchair for us, as we don't have a big dining room and our kitchen is much too small for a highchair. LOVE THIS CHAIR!"
5,WOW! No more highchair Clean-up!!!!,"I had 3 highchairs for my triplets and hated every minute of clean-up. Also when they were old enough to walk, the chairs became a dangerous climbing gym. With my 4th baby, I discovered this feeding seat and I am soooo happy and so is baby! She gets to sit at the table with everyone else. The seat reclines for infant's first feedings, and grows with baby. Space Saver, very easy to clean, fairly sturdy, reasonable price. I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! The Little laminated ABC mat that fits on the tray is abit useless and flimsy, but that's a minor thing."
4,This is a great item,"This video collects some of the episodes from the first season of Eric Fogle's short lived animated series which aired on MTV in the mid-1990's. Its the story of a guy named Jim who becomes the living host for an alien being named Roy. The adventures they experience are a lot of fun, and the series makes some great references to social acceptance. I am very glad it was released on video and hope the 2nd season's episode's will also become available. If any of you are interested there was a cartoon book based on the series which came out after it ended, titled ""The Head: The Lost Episode"", written by Fogle. Its pretty funny and worth a look, though I believe its out of print and hard to find."
3,Adequate,"These pedal couplers are inexpensive and work adequately but only for pedals that have input/outputs of the same height; they work well if you have all the same pedal brand on your board. However, if like me, you have six different brands all with different input/output configurations, these couplers will be limited in their use.So bottom line, if you have pedals of all the same brand or same input/output ocnfiguration, these will work. If not, you might opt for On Stage PC305 Angled couplers which give you some flexibility with pedals that differ."
3,It's Okay,"My classroom textbooks did a better job. I found this to be okay support material, but difficult to use as a reference on my Kindle Paperwhite."
5,great job,No issues... great service and thanks so much for being swift. I am giving it as a gift for Christmas and it came way before time. I appreciate the packing so that no one knew what was inside it. Very well packaged.
4,Helpful,"This book is very helpful while I am in my paramedic class, but you do need to have a basic understanding of A&P when you go into it."
4,JPS Tanakh,"All I suggest is this: If you have a difficult time reading very small text, DO NOT BUY THIS.Also, I was a bit put off by the bar-code printed in the inner cover.Other than that, this is a fine translation, the book is well made."
3,For my son,Did not realize it had to be put together and it was a little difficult for my 10 year old son to do by himself.
1,Terrible Toy,I hate it. I thought it was metal and would come complete judging by the pictures I saw of it. Even as I tried to put it together about 5 parts broke and I was only on step 1. Never again. Thats about 17.00 I am never getting back.
3,"In my particular case, it didn't do much","I've suffered from mild to sometimes severe adult acne for many years now. A lot of reviews online expressed that this product did what nothing else could do.In particular case it didn't help much, although I must admit my skin got a little better. I used up two bottles, but I think that Murad doesn't address my specific problems. I have tried everything, the only two things that have fully worked for me so far were Acutane (a very dangerous drug) and fasting.This means that my acne is probably due to some sort of allergy. If you haven't tried many methods to get rid of your problem, then probably this is a good option, but if you suspect that your problem is due to possible food allergies, then I suggest doing an elimination diet in addition to taking this supplement, in my case, my acne has gotten way better since I stopped eating soy products."
1,Utter ...,I only spent [money] on this one and it wasn't even worth that much. The pictures of an autopsy on the back are not actually part of the DVD. All of the segments are insanely fake and none of the usual interesting alien segments were featured. Watch the Discovery Channel instead. At least that one is free.
2,Only sporadically useful,"There are much better books on Austin, and much more complete. This seems more like a school paper on the city, as it glances over the wonders and possibilities of the city. Add the thin material to the poor layout and you, too, will be disappointed if you're hoping for a guide to this amazing city.Even though it's now slightly out of date, give the Austin Insider's Guide your cash, not this thing. It's almost encyclopedic in its contents."
5,Excelente,"Excelente producto, ya poseo varios productos SanDisk y hasta ahora todos han sido de muy buena calidad. Esta memoria la uso tanto en la cámara digital, con el adaptador, como en el teléfono celular. Muy buena relación precio valor."
1,Should not have been sold for GPS,This micro card is useless for the GPS unit and totally wastes my money. It should not have been promoted with GPS-related equipment.
5,Good cards,"I've used SanDisk cards for several different devices over the years. I bought this one to go in my Blackberry to add music, pictures, videos, etc. It's a great little card and I've had no problems with it."
2,OK,This card was meant for a Motorola Slvr but it would not work with the phone. We're using it with a Nokia flip phone and it's doing the job. We were disappointed that it didn't work with the intended phone.
4,Worked as Expected...Sort Of...,"I'm not sure exactly how to evaluate a micro disk. It certainly did what it was supposed to do. My only issue is that I didn't read the fine print on my cell phone (LG CU500) and didn't realize that it could only handle a max of 1 GB. So, I'm using the micro SD 2 GB card with the adapter as a storage device on my Canon printers. I have no other devices that use an SD card. Well, my fault for not knowing the details of my phone."
4,It's ... too big?!?,"I was very impressed with the speed of shipping and package condition. When I saw the card ... I had to just stare for aminute. There's 2GBs on a card THAT small!! It's a good feeling. Scandisk's card is, as always, very high quality. And it works effeciantly.My cellphone, on the other hand ... dosn't totaly like it. For one, the Samsung phone can only read the card if it's formatted in FAT. Windows uses FAT32. Doesn't sound like much, but it makes a big difference. The card MUST be reformatted correctly, or my phone can't read it. Unfortunately, once formatted to FAT, I can only store up to 1GB on it. Anything stored over 1GB seems to become corrupted.SO ... I got what I wanted, but now I can't use half of it! If you plan on using the card in a Cell, make sure you know the format you Cell uses before buying anything over 1gb."
5,SanDisk Digital Storage,"Gotta love SanDisk. There have been problems with other digital memory producers, but SanDisk is top notch. Quality control is obviously up and running. No problems whatsoever."
1,Order Cancelled???? (and for no reason),Waited several days after ordering only to find that my order was canceled.Nice.
1,no honesty,"I ordered this product for my LG CU500 Cingular cellphone but I was never told that it will work with my cellphone since it does not have the capacity to hold 2GB. I show have been told my them that my cellphone only is capable to hold 1GB. And as I read on the return policy , you are only given up to 7days, and not the total 15 days to return the item. So I was robbed twice by them. I will never buy anything from them and you should reconsider buying from them as well."
3,A Little Small,"I should have known when it said, mini I could possibly have problems with these. But, the truth is I still use them for opening little things around the house, although they aren't very sharp at all. I will probably keep these just in case I have a another flare up."
4,Good scissors for little hands,"Bought these for my 5 year old with CP. Perfect size for little hands, allows for hand over hand and they cut good."
4,Great for little hands,These scissors are great for my 5 year old autistic son who has fine motor issues. Easy to squeeze going up and down or sideways.
4,Plastic Foldable Earring Case,"This is a helpful device for someone who too many earrings for a jewelry box. It helps me organize my earrings by color and size. I love the fact I can fold it and put it away also. It has just a couple of minor draw backs; some earring sets don't fit on it such as 'certain' size loop earrings, and you need the post earring 'backs' to hold the posts on which is obvious, but I was missing a few. I bought 2 of these cases and am happy I did."
5,Jewelry holder,"This is nice. The holes are a bit close so if your earrings are large you will be using space for two. That said, it stands up well and doesn't tip over easily. I'm glad i bought it."
5,Perfect Organizer,I am very pleased with this purchase. Easy to use and holds all of my earrings so that I can see them to pick which to wear. I used to keep them in a jewelry box and could never find the ones I wanted. Easy to hand earrings on...love this!
2,Cheap plastic material and had a weird religious insert when it arrived...,"Pros: This earring rack holds a LOT of pairs of earrings, unlike some that only hold maybe 15 or 20!Cons: Very cheap transparent hard plastic material that cracks when it's touched. Also, this beast has a propensity to fall over, which can create a mess of earrings that takes awhile to set back up.It also came with a very strange religious insert when it arrived that really kind of freaked me out (and what religion has to do with earring racks, I don't know). I thought this was quite inappropriate--and even offensive--and it turned me off from ordering from this company again."
5,acrylic foldable earring screen,Received the foldable earring screen in a record time and am very pleased with purchase.
2,Earing set,"hi my name it torta, i still haven't gotten my package ands its been a long time and i would really like to have it."
3,Good,Now I can build a collection and not have to dig through my old jewelry box to find what I'm looking for. Good value for the price.
3,Great Value but only fits certain types of earrings,I bought this as a gift for my mom - and she liked it so much that I got one too!Fast forward to me trying to put my earrings on: small hoop earrings do not fit! Nor do large bulky earrings or very long ones. Fish hook backings you have to strategically put on so not to bend the earring. Screw backings might fit - it depends on the earring post length from the threads to the earring. I had a pair that the plastic was too thick (so the screw threads couldn't catch).One thing I really like was that this easily folded up accordion style - as long as the earrings aren't too bulky. This is great for storage. :)Would I buy again? Yup. Works pretty well for the type of earrings I wear.
4,Looks good once loaded with jewelry,"I wasn't sure I was going to like this rack - I had hoped to find a more natural, maybe wood holder for earrings. But I like this one - once you put your earrings on it, it looks nice. I also drape my bracelets on the top here and there."
5,Folding Earring Holder,"I am a native American I make beaded earrings to sell...I was going home for family Gathering as i do every year 2nd week end in October..I used the earring display holder on my table..People could see them better I could put price over the Panel of each and divide them by price this way.. They were easier to see and easier to remove when customer looked at them...It Was great and handy to have i could even fold it back up with the earrings on them and repack for the trip home...But I didn't have many earrings left..Think i sold more this year than any other time..Folding Earring Screen (Clear) (10-5/8""H x 17""W)"
3,Arrived Broken,"The item was sent in a shipping bag with absolutely no wrapping or cushioning whatsoever, so it was no surprise that it arrived broken in two places. I was able to glue it together. If it was shipped correctly, it would be a superior value for the money. As it is, it was a fair deal."
2,Erasing Code Problem,We bought this product and it worked fine until it was dropped while being played. All of the codes in the device disappeared. We exchanged it for a new one and within a week all of the codes disappeared when too many codes were loaded into the game at one time. We returned it for a refund.
5,Action Replay - the greatest!,"My friend has this, and he used it to get me a Deoxys, infinite money, and infinite master balls on my Sapphire. The internet linkup is really cool: if two people each have internet and an AR, they can trade game saves. It might even be able to be used as a link cable, who knows?Be warned that this may have some side effects on your game - unwanted side effects. My friend says that his Ruby is ""addicted"" to the twelve codes he put on it. If he starts it up without those twelve codes, it starts malfunctioning. However, when he put the codes for infinite masterballs and money on mine, it didn't malfunction when he took it out, so it depends."
1,very bad,"when i got this game it worked,but after useing a lot it would not load.i tried to update it but it would not even load it.trust me do not wast money on this game.i give it one little star"
5,Action Replay (GBA),"If you buy this Action Replay (AR) it will allow you to cheat your way through the game like in a few hours. If your playing Pokemon games such as Pokemon Ruby you can get all OLD Pokemon (Kanto: Bulbasaur,Charmander,Squirtle) (Johto: Chikorita,Cyndaquil,Totodile) (Honen: Treecko,Torchic,Mudkip) you can get any pokemon you want and as many Master Ball's you want like INFINITE. You can get as much as the Legendary Rare Pokemon like Articuno,Moltres,Zapdos,Entei,Raikou,Suicuni,Ho-Oh,Lugia,Groundon,Kyogre,Rayquaza,Celebi and much much more.Enjoy playing with an Action Replay for Pokemon fans."
3,This only works a limited amount of time.,I bought this ...at the store and it only worked for one month and then it stopped working. I can't even play games on it anymore. I would suggest just playing a game boy advance with out an Action Replay.
1,This is a Rip off,I read the reveiws on here about this product and figured My son would be lucky and his would work..Boy was I wrong he hasn't had it two weeks and it's already not working with any of his games.Products like this shouldn't be sold at all.
1,No coincidence!,"I bought an action replay a few days after my friends to replace my crappy gameshark. Everyone that I know who bought 1got his (or hers) screwed up QUICK!! Within 2 weeks, EVERY SINGLE ONE GOT SCREWED UP!! This can't be a coincidence! If you STILL want to buy one, don't bother. You might as well flush 20 bucks down the potty!!"
3,Worked great until all memory was deleted (all games),"Was working great for my son and then one day the entire memory decided to wipe itself clean, completely no games left in memory as it was when it shipped. Codes can be entered but it would take years to program all the games back into the cartridge."
5,Great Light,"I liked it, well packaged, seems reasonably sturdy for the price. Nice and bright, I thought it was broken at first because I turned it on and only one row of LEDs lit up, then I pushed the button again and both rows did...nice feature. You can't beat it for the price."
3,Bright lights from cheap plastic,"Works great but you can't touch it and have confidence in it's long term survivability. I think the batteries will last longer than the case. It was cheap, though."
5,Informative and readable.,"Each section presents information clearly in a readable, non-erudite manner. The chapter synopses reinforce the presented information. I used this as a textbook in an Adult Education Masters course. I recommend it for those new to the profession."
5,Excellent Intermediate to Advanced Collection,"This collection was first introduced to me through my violin teacher, the late Adreinne Krasner (wife of Louis Krasner who debued the Berg Violin Concerto). Since that time I have returned again, and again to it with my own students. My favorite is the Preludium and Allegro but the Sicilienne and Rigadoun are very popular as well."
1,TERRIBLE MODEL,THIS MODEL AIRCRAFT IS INCOMPLETE IT IS MISSING THE WINDSCEEN AND CANOPY MY MOM IS GOING TO RETURN IT. I WAS GOING TO PRESENT THIS MODEL IN A COUNTY FAIR BUT NOW I CAN NOT.
4,An incredible concept and well done.,"My 7 year old and I loved the book. The illustrations are wonderful and it really inspired thought. However, for the price it was over and done with a little quickly - we spent maybe a half hour on it."
5,A story with no words.,"This is a beautiful book with intriguing pictures of an underwater world, complete with fish and merpeople civilizations. It's nothing in-depth, but each page is an exciting discovery, and the final series of pictures was a happy surprise. ""Flotsam"" is a colorful twist on the classic ""message in a bottle"" and is not to be missed by the visually oriented and/or children - then again, nor should it be missed by adults or anyone who loves a good stories - words or no."
1,Did not get what was ordered,"This item listed was not the SK 42775 1/2"" wrench somebody messed up. I stead I received a set of 4 stubby screw drivers"
1,one of the worst I've played,"this game looks and feels like a PS1 game. Wolverine kind of glides around like his is skating, not very realistic. It's a button masher like the hulk."
4,Cool Game,"If you are a fan of the comic book Wolverine (forget the X2 crap), then this is the game for you...With action from the Weapon X days to current, this game plays just like a great story from the comics...Long time Wolverine writer Larry Hama put together a solid story with great action, challenge and innovative gameplay....A bit violent for younger gamers due to the animations of his stealth claw attacks, but for those who have ""The Uncanny X-men"" # 133 will love to play this game!!! The ""berserker rage"" is right on the money!!I highly recommend this game if this is your genre (action & adventure) and you love the classic Wolverine (cockrum, byrne, smith, lee) (I stopped collecting around 350)...A great Marvel game like this is long overdue!!"
2,Unfinished,"Wolverine's Revenge is a game in which you get to fight bad guys, activate switches, fight bosses, and, oh, fight more guys. The creators of WR were probably in a hurry to finish the game before X2 came out, and it seams somewhat unfinished.The fighting in WR is repetetive and will get boring after a couple of hours. Once you hit someone, or someone hits you, you are locked in fighting mode until you can get out. It sometimes can be hard to do, and it gets very frustrating.Perhaps the worst thing about this game is that is way to easy. Just fight some guys, find a corner to heal, and go on to the next bunch. I don't recomend this game, unless you are a huge Wolverine fan."
5,Very Durable,Has very good quality and is very durable. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a cheap but nice cable.
3,"To be not the original soundtrack music, this is quite good","This is maybe ""poormans"" horror music, since it`s not from the orginal movies, but it`s quite well performed by the Silver screen Orchestra. It begins with the devil and ends with the devil (Track 1: The Omen) and Track 15 The Exorcist 2: The Heretic. But how is it inbetween ? Short melodies needs short comments, and i try to use horrific terms so to speak:1. The Omen. Horrific.2. Psycho. Screamable3. Scream. Disturbing.4. Halloween. Hypnotic.5. The Exorsist. Freeeezy6. Poltegeist. Spooky.7. Friday 13 th. Murderish.8. Dracula. Blooooody.9. Christhine. Effective.10. The Hunger. Weird11.A Nightmare on Elm street. Nightmarish.12. The prince of darkness. Dark.13. Silence of the lambs. Shivers.14. The Shining. Gloomy15. The Exorsist 2: DevilshShall i show you something realy scary? This one is not to easy to get hold to, so you can go to the original soundtrack to pick your favourites."
4,"Test of the Twins (Dragonlance Legends, Vol 3)","Loved the book, LOVED it, but very very disappointed that the saga doesn't continue forward from this spot. There are other books that pick up later on (much later) but naturally I'd like to see a smooth segue' into the next segment of this same tale. Oh, well...the series and this book are still well worth reading."
5,Not just a young adults book,"I first read this trilogy whan I was in Jr. high. I was entranced, enamored, captivated. So when I read it again earlier this year, I expected to be disappointed. I've read a lot of books since, and have significantly upped my normal level of reading.But guess what. I still love it. Maybe it's nostalga. Maybe it's just a damn good book if you take it at face value. Sure, it's no great work of adult literature. But here's the thing - I cared about these characters. More than any other characters in any other books I've read, probably. When a book has that, much of the rest is forgettable and forgivable. If you read it in your youth and want a flashback, read it again. If you haven't, try it. This is one of few I've read more than once - have read it three times now!"
4,one small error,"I read this book a few years ago and have recently had the opportutnity to perue through it once again. It is a well written and cogent piece of scholarship. It is however a little lacking in it's treatment of the very vocal right wing of Orthodox Jewry during the relevant period, and is thus not a comprehensive study. There is also one factual error which I wish to point out and correct. In chapter one of the book the author states that Cantor Zawel Kwartin was cantor in Temple Beth El in Borough Park, Brooklyn. Kwartin was not the cantor in Beth El, an Orthodox synagogue, but was the cantor on Comgregation Emauel, a conservative temple in the same neighborhood. The chazanim at Beth El were: Jacob Rappaport, Mordechai Hershman, Berele Chagy, Moshe Kousevitsky, Sol Zim, Moshe Stern, Rueven Blum, and curently, Ben-Zion Miller."
3,"Good, but imitated.","Let me say that I agree that these musicians are definitely a talented bunch and create some great music ambience. However, I also must say that this is the most blatant imitation/copy of Porcupine Tree I've ever heard(In Absentia, Deadwing anyways, hence the 3 star review). As one reviewer said his g/f thought it was a S.W. project. That's because it sounds exactly like PT from the vocal style/timing to the bass & guitar interaction. If you dont believe me listen to Mother May I on A.G'g album then listen to So Called Friend by PT and try to tell me I don't have a point. After all that, we can hope these guys will be able to find their own voice on their next effort. If you just can't get enough PT buy this album and pretend it's them, =PPeace"
1,very strong odor,I just started using the product and tried it only once. That is why I can not rate it. My first impression is that the product smell very strong and bothered my eyes for about 30 min. I'll continue to use it to see how it will work on my skin.
2,Not Great for Large Doorways!,"Maybe I didn't understand its operation but I bought this to fit a 64"" doorway. The way I understood it from the directions was that if you are using all three panels, then you must have room for all three panels to swing open. I bought it for great grandmom's house and although she lives in a smaller row home she has a large doorway but no room for 65+ inches of a gate to swing open."
1,Poor Quality,"We installed this gate 1 1/2 weeks ago, and as I was opening the gate, the upper panel pulled right out of the wall, with the gate almost falling on my son! We are using the gate to block off a 60"" space, between the dining room and the kitchen, so it gets fairly frequent use. We are also using all 3 panels. The gate took much time to install, and even if it HADN'T pulled out of our wall, I wouldn't reccommend to anyone. Directions are vague, and photos on box don't match hardware with product. Will be contacting company and retailer for refund."
1,METAL GATE with PLASTIC HINGES,"I did not realize so many bad reviews before i bought it. Nice looking METAL GATE (heavy) with PLASTIC HINGES... it last a few days. Now I have to get new hinges ... but not sure where. I usually read reviews, this time I did not and I feel sorry I didn't."
1,Wait for Nintendo,By the time the PS2 gets some good games the next Nintendo box will be out. Why fork over a lot of money for a DVD player? You'll be buying one with better features later anyway. The PS2 had it's chance and it has kept people waiting a little too long.
4,RFU Adapters,"We were glad to see the UPS man deliver our PS2 the other day. Prior to connecting the PS2 to the TV I read the instructions. I noticed that our TV did not have the more up-to-date connections in the back that was needed to get the PS2 running right away. Nor did our receiver have an optical connection. ... Overall, we like our PS2 a lot, the graphics are great, however, the startup and loading are slower than expected. I'm sure we will enjoy our PS2 more and more as we try out different games on it and play DVDs."
1,just a taste of Yoga and Pilates,"Was not pleased with this DVD, the exercises and poses were few and very basic.This video is only good if you have no idea what yoga or pilates entails. If you have ever seen a yoga or pilates session on TV or on the internet, you already know more than what is contained on this video.The music was very bland and did not match the exercises. In addition, the instructors voice was over powering and too loud.Bottom line, skip this DVD and find a different one."
1,Revell Helicopter,"I thought this was a toy my grandson could play with, but instead it was a model. I didn't know anything about models and how to read about them, so it was my fault."
2,lacking,"too bad nice idea but not thought out very well clumbsy not high def video, i'm not very happy with it, not the quality it was advertised as.look at this closely before you buy i didn't i got burned."
3,Good for its day,"The Neuros OSD was an early, noble attempt to create a versatile video recorder platform out of a single, powerful Texas Instruments system-on-chip to achieve a new level of compactness and low energy use. It works well, but is underpowered. It is a Linux toy for me. Neuros technology has not upgraded the product with later TI chip but instead replaced it with a quiet but adequately powerful PC-based box that is a much better Linux toy."
5,"Decent cable for connecting a drum trigger to a 1/8"" input","I'm using this cable to connect addrum Red Shot Tom/Snare Triggerto a Beat Bug. It works fine and it was cheap, so I'm happy with it."
2,Dangerous activities for children presented as fun,"The machines are , indeed, mesmerizing, but please be sure an adult watches this video with your children. Children are repeatedly shown doing such unsafe activities as climbing unsupervised on construction machinery, playing in dirt walled excavations, and playing only a few feet from construction machinery that is operating. It sure looks like fun and it sure is dangerous! I would have rated the video much higher if not for this very serious fault. Every year children are killed while playing like this. I would hope the makers would re-edit later releases and stress safe play around machinery."
1,Received wrong item,"I received 1/8"" to 1/4"" stereo adapters, not RCA to 1/4 TS mono adapters.It's not really worth the effort to return them; I guess I'll just go to Radio Shack to make sure that I get the correct adapters..."
4,BE ADVISED,"This an excellent book for an introduction to the Riemann Hypothesis and the individuals working to solve it.BUT BE ADVISED: This is the same book as the authors recently released: The Riemann Hypothesis. If you already have a copy of The Riemann Hypthsis by Karl Sabbagh, don't buy this book!!!!"
4,classic oldie cartoons,"this DVD, as well as volume one, provides a couple of solid hours of good old classic cartoons. The only flaw in this DVD I've found is that it looks like on one of the oldest cartoons there was an editing error made and a couple of words were cut out. I know this, because I remember watching it repeatedly as a youngster. These are WW2 era cartoons with lots of porky pig and popeye. vol. 1 is more bugs, porky and daffy."
5,As Expected,"Did away with original breather for my '68 Chevy Impala; therefore, I needed a vent filter for my valve cover. Stuck a rubber gromment in and ordered this K&N vent filter to fit in the hole. Works perfect. Good buy and good price."
3,Egh...,"There are a great many P-51 kits on the market, most are more then likely of higher quality than this one. I bought this particular one because of the nose art ""Big Beautiful Doll"". It's a somewhat flimsy kit, I've had worse but that's not saying much. For a few extra dollars you can get a nicer Tamiya kit. I believe they have a ""Old Crow"" model (one of the more popular nose art reproductions). There aren't many features in this kit, and maybe only fifty or sixty parts.If you want a notable American WWII fighter-bomber, and don't care about quality or are looking for a cheaper kit, go for the Revell/Monogram P-47D Thunderbolt Razorback. It's a kit from the sixties like this P-51 is, but it is of a far higher quality."
5,mustang plane model,"Great model for my 13 year old, wwII fan. He built it without much trouble (of course he is a smart kid). Great ""toy"" for following directions and using fine motor skill."
2,Difficult to live up to an ambitious title,"Disappointing. The title and advertising lure you in, but there is nothing new. While reading the book I was hoping to be stimulated or challenged at least once by a novel concept. It never happened."
2,Pointless Preview,"The preview never gets to the actual show, but shows commercials for Wesstinghouse (REALLY Old) and a several hosts commenting on National Printing week. Even for a small fee I'd like to see a bit of the actual show, particularly since it goes back to the l950s."
5,Handy adapter when working with balanced audio,"Most equipment outputs in xlr-M and you accumulate an overabundance of something to XLRM cables. With the Female to Female adapter you can often get yourself out of a connection jam by joining two cables that terminate in an xlr-M plug. This is a handy way to get two plugs to interface if you have the proper cables on hand.Having 2 of these in your audio toolbox is a must these days if you encounter multiple types of audio connectors (RCA, TRS, TR, etc)"
2,"Ordered two, one was bad",As with anything you should immediately test when received.When I plugged this into a male jack then removed it I found that one of the two gender-benders I'd ordered had a female pin that would not stay in the connector shell.Being an old electronics tech I noted that the locking tab was deformed - poor quality components.Due to the low cost I decided to send it back using Amazon's automated system and I'm waiting for a replacement now.
1,Buy MCI Worldcom!,"Yes, this book actually recommends Worldcom (among a host of other lesser losers). It's interesting as a historical relic of the irrationally exuberant nonsense that pervaded in the late 90s. It should have been called Dow 4,000."
3,What I like about the Romantics.,"This is a pretty simple collection, only 36 minutes, however the Romantics didn't really storm the charts too often. This does give you what you want though. ""What I Like About You"" of course is included, and kicks off the disc well. Their other hit ""Talking In Your Sleep"" is great, and got tons of radio time when it came out. Very catchy. Another song I had forgotten about is ""One In A Million"", and many might recognize that as well. The rest is good filler, the best of which is probably ""Open Up Your Door"". In short, this is the only Romantics disc any casual fan should ever need."
1,don't buy this product,These were the worst windshield wipers that I ever purchased. I spent over $90 to equip both of my vehicles with these wipers and they worked ok for a week or two and then they were streaky and would not clean the windshield.
1,Don't Buy!,"I bought these wipers to replace my Rain-X Latitudes and it was a mistake. I was happy with my Rain-X, but I thought I'll try Bosch based on some positive reviews. I was wrong. It started streaking a month after installing it. After a couple months, streaks were all over my windshield making it a driving hazard. It was raining really hard one night and I literrally could not see. I just recently purchased some Rain-X wipers and will be sticking with them from now on."
4,fun for all ages,"I bought this toy for my 4 year old boy, but his younger brother who is 2 years loves it too. i gave this toy an overall score of four because sometimes the kids wont play because they get nervous about the crocodile biting thier hands. but when they do play they scream and laugh everytime the mouth closes. i love that it has no batteries and there are no pieces to lose. i am glad i bought this toy."
2,Fun for about 5 minutes,"This game is fun a few times, and then gets put back in the box never to be looked at again. It takes no skill and is over in 30 seconds. Maybe it is the age of my son, he got this for his 5th birthday, but I would save the money and buy a game with more thinking and that will be enjoyed more than a few times, like Clue Jr. or Monopoly Jr. Or if you are looking for a more simple game like this one that will hold more attention, Whac-A-Mole is better or even Elefun (I think the new one is a flying fish version). Hullabaloo is also a great game, even for only one child to play. I am glad my son got this as a gift and we didn't waste our own money on it!"
1,Be careful!,"This was a great fun toy, until it was left on the floor of my sons room. I went running in the room when my daughter was crying and stepped on it. I got my pinkie toe stuck in the back of the croc's neck(I know it sounds ridiiculous!) and could not get it out! I had to call my neighbor over to help because it was like a vice and got tighter the more I moved. He was able to unscrew the mouth off and get me out, my toe was completely twisted. The odds of this happening are probably slim, but it could have been much worse had it been a child. I don't recommend it!!!!"
3,As good as the rest.,"It didn't work for me... I've yet to find something short of prescriptions that do work... but this at least reduced the number of blemishes a bit.As with anything, results vary by individual, so it may be what you're looking for.Worth a shot!~BB"
2,Slow and Boring,"Never used this; Sold it at our Homeschool Used Booksale! A person who is super into development might love the abc123 style but i found it to be~~ well ~~~~ blah.Instead,We made a corner of our living room into an Art table, put a Huge Sandbox in the yard, Got rid of the T.V, and took our little ones Outside for Nature Hikes . Way less stress and planning involved!!!"
4,Clean and refreshing - but can leave a 'sticky' residue,"I like this product - it's more moisturizing than other toners. The directions state you can spritz it directly on your face and let it air dry or you can gently wipe it off. I notice that when I spritz it on and let it air dry, it can leave kind of a sticky feel to my skin after it's dried. Otherwise, I like it."
2,Disappointed,I've been a Crystal Gayle fan since I saw her in concert in San Diego many years ago and feel some of the songs she sang in this DVD were good. The part where John Davidson sings to the kids outside the homes should have been cut. I would have liked to hear more songs sung by Crystal Gayle. It was hard to get into a flowing Christmas feeling.
1,Not As Presented in Description,"The Anti-Glare Screen Protector was described as ""sized to specifically fit"" the Sony Cybershot DSC-W50. This is not true; the protector had to be cut down (by almost half) to fit the screen. I expected to receive a protector that was the same size as the camera screen based on the description. There also was not enough left of the protecter to provide for a second application."
4,Great action film mixed with hongkong stylish action,"There are so many interesting items in this movie. ricksha-race, tiny microbombs, fighting on a huge ship. After DOUBLE TEAM, famous hongkong director Tsui Hark created a great movie again. You can also enjoy the scenes of hongkong transition."
2,Plenty of Action,"Since the latest Van Damme movie releases have barely contained any action scenes, it's refreshing to find that Knockoff is full of fighting and martial arts sequences.Unfortunately, Van Damme tries hard to appear somewhat [slow] at the beginning of the movie, and then suddenly becomes serious and then [slow] again. While I can't explain the need to change personalities, these transitions do reduce the plot to nothing more than an unorganized mess with kicking and punching tossed in between."
2,Does not accept all Blu Ray DVD's.,"Most frustrating for me was finding out this bargain dvd player does not accept all blu ray formats. Would have been nice to know that before purchasing it. So, essentially, I have a brand new dvd player that works fifty percent of the time."
1,Confused non-techie,"I just received this preamp and have no idea how to connect it to my laptop. The 1-page instruction says to connect the preamp to the ""appropriate input"" to my computer??? Huh? The unit comes with no cables so I have no idea what to connect with. There is no port on my PC labelled appropriate input, so that instruction has flown over my head. There are no diagrams to clue me in. I will sit down and try to figure this out, but at this price, I should not have to interpret instructions. Rant ends."
1,Hosa GXR 134 Adapter,"This product is made to fail, I have purchased three, the first one was not making a connection so I pulled it out of my sub woofer and notice the contact pin had broken off. I then order two more thinking I may have been at fault, well after being a Hi Fi guy for 55 years I know how to plug in and RCA plug. The two new ones were as well defective..M Bellas"
3,Decent book to help get you started,"If you are new to creating space ads or writing copy, this is an excellent book to get you started. You will see many concrete examples and you will start to think like a advertising guru. However, if you are an experienced ad designer or copy writer and hoping for some fresh ideas, then you may be disappointed."
5,Works well,As a good appliance this inverter works very well. It suits my needs perfectly because it has both a 110V outlet and a 12V pass-thru.
5,Excellent!,Will buy another dif type when I purchase another camera. I definitely recommend! Alot better than those leather ones IMHO. And better without the bulky baggage and cases. Purchased For my Canon SX50 and its a great fit.
3,Battery,"The only problem is the battey will not last a full length movie. A sparebattery would be recomended, At $50 it almost as much as new unit."
1,"A waste of money, worthless","This review is for Brothers in Arms - Hell's Highway for PC.The graphics look great, unfortunately the controls are preset and can't be customized. You can't use the mouse to move, must use the keyboard. The mouse is for looking and firing only. I played for 3 minutes and uninstalled the game. How dumb to make the controls non-customizable."
3,There are better options,I've tried a couple of Tea Tree oils before and I personally feel that this is the least effective one.
4,Another Compilation,"But what a compilation. It goes where no other Morrisey greatest hits package has gone before. It includes songs from each of his solo albums, including the latest ""Maladjusted"" and it even includes what seems to be a one-off UK single ""Lost"". ""Lost"" is worth the price of the cd alone. Of course, you also get all the other songs that we all have a hundered times over, but, honestly, one can never have too much Morrisey!"
4,morrissey - greatest hits review,"This is a great CD if you like the Smiths / Morrissey, but don't want to buy every album. This one has a good sampling of the better Morrissey songs. I like the music, but I'm not so excited about the album cover. Why does he have to have cuts on his arm? Is he proud of it? Is that something he promotes? What a freak... but he sings on key!"
2,Heaven knows a lot of fans will hate me for this one...,"""I'm soooo sorrryyy""....but: Morrissey, bless his heart, just didn't amount to much musically without the genius of Johnny Marr's guitar behind him. So, if you're new to Morrissey, I would advise you to begin with The Smiths, a truly timeless and wonderful band. The charm and wit of Morrissey is undeniable, but people need more than mystique when it comes to music. Namely, I need GOOD MUSIC, and that is the element missing in his recordings. I'll celebrate his mystique from afar. And if you see him hanging out in that bowling alley in Eagle Rock, tell him I said thanks for the memories. And he's right: Some girls are bigger than others."
4,Really good breast pump,"This is a really good breast pump for the money - it's not as expensive as a madela breast pump and it works very well. I used mine for about 3 months never had any problems with it - it's simple to put together, clean and take apart and it's very easy to use. It even comes with a carrying case. It worked great!"
4,Svenska,Came early. Very cheap. Have to iron out the fold wrinkles. Overall though it was worth the money and it's now hanging above my bed.
3,How bout more of the engagement?,"Now I'm not saying this was a bad book. I actually read it in two days. However, with the title ""courage on little round top"" i was expecting a little more of the engagement on little round top. it wasn't until the very last chapter of the book that the engagement took place. if you really want to read about little round top i would say Shaara's Killer Angel's will do the trick. Again, a very good book just took a while to get to the actual ""courage"""
3,Buy this for the live footage,"This DVD is worth picking up for the live footage of Jacob Miller, Peter Tosh, URoy, Dennis Brown, which is available nowhere else. The picture quality is OK, the sound is passable, but the performances are great, and most songs are complete.Worth owning."
1,not good to watch,"picture is bad, story difficult to follow,disc is turned upside down,the movie on the other side is more bad or worse than the other,the label of the movie is more attractive and interesting than its contents.I couldn't finish both movies."
1,occasional spoke tighteneing is due to chinese bad quality spokes,"""occasional spoke tightening"" (as customers wrote their reviews here) is due to the fact that the wheel has low quality, chinese, brittle, severely undertensioned spokes. They all break when I ride such wheels. If you tighten them to the PROPER tension, they will break, too. Invest couple of dollars more and buy high quality spokes that never break such as DT Swiss or WheelSmith"
3,Nostalgic,"To be honest, the only song I know from the McCoys is ""Hang on Sloopy"", which of course is as good as I remember it. The rest of the album is what one might expect from a '60's pop band, so okay, but not the best 'best of"" I have heard.Still, I will play it and get nostalgic enjoyment from it."
3,Thought provoking,"I got this after the nine eleven attacks and wanted to more about terrorists and how they think and what types of scenarios they have under the radar, since it was very controversial the Oklahoma incident and there was more beneath the surface.There was more beneath the surface and it was a good idea to show what this was all about.So there are plenty details about a militia that the subject joined along with two others who were persons of interest, it would be interesting to see what has become of them after awhile.The militia is what led to the other persons of interest. Importantly, the militia was not while the subject was in the Army, he signed up after discharge apparently or was in the process of signing up around the Gulf war incident. Valuable for its earch into the mind of a veteran of the Gulf war, and just as cautionary as any other in its subject matter. Recommend...Aryan Somers"
4,1/4female coupler from amazon.,"Product works well happy with it got it quickly, would recommend to a friend . No problem with shipping, was as it was describe , would deal with this co for other products thank you."
3,okay.,Feels a little cheap but works well. So I really can't complain. and it'll serve me well enough for the small stuff I do...and any hum in my recordings I gleefully work on removing in post.
3,Maybe too good.,"If this cleans out ammonia, nitrite, and nitrates, then won't the biological filter bacteria starve and die and you will be left with having to use this product in place of a bio filter."
5,Superb,"With DCD, the fans usually have all their stuff...so why bother with a box set? right? I dunno. If you are going to sink some hard earned money into one, something like this should do the trick. This has so much material and such an interesting selection that in today's economy it's actually a great way for neophytes and collectors to bring everything full circle.DCD has been such a monumental force in the world of music and perhaps are closing chapters for good, I must recommend this one wholeheartedly."
3,Save yourself some $$$...,"...and just download the song The Carnival Is Over, which I would give 5 stars. I like Dead Can Dance, but none of their songs match The Carnival Is Over, in my opinion. Severance is good, but I like Bauhaus' Studio Version of Severance (from their Gotham album) better."
5,OMFG!!!! It has a DVD!,"I'm a huge Dead Can Dance fan, and bought this Box Set to complete my collection. Was it worth it? Without listening to it, I can say a definitive and enthusiastic ""yes!""Why? Because I opened up the package to find a DVD inside with the Towards the Within Live concert video in it. Only better! The DVD also includes 5 music/promotional videos. The video for ""Yulunga"" set to the visuals from the film Baraka is a definite highlight. Also the videos for ""Protagonist"" and ""Frontier"" are quite a nice/strange visual experience.The packaging is a beautiful booklet full of images and a history. The only drawback is that it's so nice, I don't want to open it to get the discs out.Any new Dead Can Dance fan will enjoy the three discs that will expose them to this wonderful music. Any old DCD fan will want this for the DVD. Totally worth it."
5,a MUST for fans,"I came across this CD by chance . Just browsing through pages of cds , when i saw a collection . I thought ""yeah right , another Best Of album"" . But i looked into the tracklist and saw that the songs covered were not only the classic hit singles -- so to say . There were demo versions and unreleased tracks .I ordered it and received it a few days later . For starters the packaging is excellent ! It is like an encyclopedia of Dead Can Dance . Hard cover with engraved lettering all around . Lyrics , pictures -- the works !My biggest surprise was looking inside where i found 4 cds instead of 3 as listed on the back . Looking at the forth and final disk i noticed it did not say cd but DVD ! I was shocked to see that they had included the Towards the Within Live on DVD as well ! And all that for an incredible price !What can i say but a big BRAVO to those who released this ! Good job and i hope more bands take this as an example release for their future collections ."
3,A good shoe tree.,"This is a good cedar shoe tree, but I recommend the woodlore epic twin tube shoe tree available here on Amazon. I had the wood split on one of the shoe trees where I used the handle to pull it out of my shoe, and had to super glue it back on. The heel can be a little more narrow than the style I recommended, which puts undue stress on the heel of the shoe when storing it ."
2,Disappointed in 3rd book,"Graham is an excellent writer of characters. They are very well developed. Her historical facts and stories are also well written and interesting as they flow through her plots. My problem with ""And One Rode West"" was with Christa. Although her character was detailed and developed, I just didn't like her! I couldn't find any compassion and empathy for this spoiled, sarcastic and combative young woman. Jeremy was very likable, understanding, caring, loving and Christa didn't deserve the love of this nice guy. I couldn't see what Jeremy could love in her and in his place, from the get-go, I would have shipped her back to Virginia in a heartbeat. Honestly...I couldn't wait to be finished with this book. Sorry Ms. Graham and fans..."
5,STRAIGHT AHEAD,"David ""Fathead"" Newman probaly is not the best saxophone player you will ever listen to. But he is a lyrical player and he has such a signature sound that you just got to love him. Like Hank Mobley, David ""Fat Head"" Newman kinda gets lost in the shuffle when you compare him to Sonny, Trane, Dexter, or even Stanley Turrentine !"
2,Website gave incorrect dimensions.,"The gate itself is a good product. Buyer's need to know that the manufacturer's box prints that the gate will fit up to 47.5"". The website that I purchased this item, Babies 'R' Us, states that it will fit up to 48"". This is not the case, and we have had to creatively fill the gap to make this gate securely fit our opening of 48"" exact. Just be aware of the true measurement as the stores who sell this product are not always accurate."
4,it does the job!,"i bought this gate for my puppy boxer, kiefer, so that he could come to work with me. it does the job, the only thing i would have to say is that it wasn't wide enough for the walk way we had to adjust it by using a 2x4, the walk way is not that wide so the gate should have been useful on its own this is with extensions.it keeps kiefer where he needs to be and thats all that matters!!"
4,Gate Review,"This gate would be wonderful if it wouldn't have come with one of the poles bowed out. The purpose of the gate is to keep children (and pets) from getting stuck between the poles, but this one may not do that."
3,Not good for upstairs unless bolted into the walls.,I bought this gate for my lab puppy. It works but I would not recommend it for upstairs use with babies.It works well and does the job for my puppy but I don't think it with work with babies without being bolted into the walls.My older dog is able to push it and it slides a little out of place without falling but it won't be safe for children. If you are looking at this one for kids make sure it is bolted into the walls and you will love it.
3,Security Gate,"The gate seemed well made, and was straightforward to install. However, my door opening came right at the point that was ""in between"" the size adjustments, not wide enough to add both extender panels, but so wide that the adjustment screws had to be out too far, making it easy for my dog to push out of place. So I had to return it."
3,What is the actual gate's width?,"I'm hoping that someone who's already purchased this product can help me out with a question. I purchased this gate yesterday, but after reading the onlineliterature further, I became confused on the full width of the gate. It states that it's 47 1/2 or 48 inches (depending where you look), and claims to come with a 5 inch extension and a 10 inch extension. Does the dimension of 47 1/2 inches includes the 10 inch extension, or does it not. If it doesn't, does that mean that the actual gates full possible width would be 57 1/2? I think that they could clear this up a lot better on the description."
1,disappointingly dangerous,"This gate fell several times. I ended up sending this gate back after it hurt my daughter's foot. The Evenflo SimpleStep, although an unattractive taupe color, is less expensive and of much better quality."
2,Not what I expected,"The product was too complicated for me, I guess I am not that smart, but it is difficult to align correctly and the latch doesn't work great. I would not buy this product again."
2,Not remotely worth the money,"The buying experience was not half bad - the product arrived in good time and was well packaged. Unfortunately, the remote control organizer is not worth the hot glue it took to put it together. The ""organizer"" holds 4 remotes on two shelves. But don't try to remove one remote control from the box because the other 3 go falling all over the place. The two shelves are way too shallow, covering less than half of the remote control devices and so don't hold them in place. The organizer also needs an additional internal divider so that each remote has its own spot and does not fall over when another is removed. What a waste of money - you can get a better organizer at half the price and of equal or better quality at a local store."
2,poor review guide,"Maybe it helped others, but it didn't help me. Only one of the fifty questions from the practice exam was remotely similar to one of the one hundred questions on the real test.Seemed helpful when I was reading it, but not like the actual exam at all.Find something else; I am."
2,Did i see the same movie?,I found the movie predictable and thought it tried to hard to be artsy. Frank Langella was its only redeeming quality.
2,Turns into big snoozer,"Starts out decently with the cautious relationship between the agingand becoming obscure writer and a young admirer doing her thesis about his work. However, the story bogs down and never delivers. The companion story, the touch-and-go relationship between his daughter and her boyfriend, is dull through-out. This movie is about as artistic as a slow cooked omelette."
2,Yuck!!,"Yes, Frank Langella was great in his role as the aging writer. But overall, this movie is a snoozer!I watched and watched hoping it would get better and it never took off.The story is boring!Look elsewhere for a good movie to watch this weekend!"
3,Top 40 Funk,"By no means is this an awful CD, but it's a fairly mainstream and predictable collection of tunes. Some good soul and funk tracks, although I think it's stretching the definition of ""funk"" to include tracks from the likes of Natalie Cole and Wild Cherry --- regardless of the title of their hit single. Those weak links aside, there is some great music on here, but nothing that those of us that grew up in the 1970s didn't hear played to death many times already. I'd have preferred some more obscure funk gems along with these well known tunes."
2,Age of Consent,The Age of Consent was the Directors Cut Version. Your Amazon right-up did not state this. I saw the original version on HBO or Cinemax about 15-yrs ago. This version had missing parts and sceens from the original. There were some pan & scan scenes that were clipped. I was a victim of bait and dwitch by the seller.
2,Spanking!,"During my brief tenure as a mall security guard, I played this tape over the intercom for about ten minutes. You should have SEEN the reaction it caused, the horror on people's faces. [pixel]"
2,Golfnet,"10x7 deluxe golf netThe netting is acceptable, however the framing (lower angle uprights) is too flimsy. After first wind the corner just flattened and became non supportable. Had to reinforce with metal brackets. The hold down pegs should be longer and have some nonslip ripples - they come out easily. Also, I had to tape the joints so the frame would stay in place.0 are too"
3,No tech support,"I installed the Zonet pci card without incident but there came a point where I was to enter some data about WEP. There was no directions about what to do or how to do it. Tech support email address and web site was listed on the product box. I sent an email to Tech Support showing all the data I had entered and asked about the WEP settings. It has been 2 weeks and I still have not received an answer. In-the-meantime my grandson, who has experienced installing 2 similar cards finished the installation for me.The card works OK."
4,A great starting point for a Bob Wills review!,"As a life-long Bob Wills fan, and the daughter of a Bob Wills super-fan, I've listened to almost every version of his recordings. The Tiffancy Transcriptions are excellent, and the sound quality cannot be better. This is a really enjoyable start to a great collection."
5,WESTERN SWING LOST GOLDEN NUGGETS,"THERE ARE NINE VOLUMES OF CD'S OF BOB WILLS' AND THE TEXAS PLAYBOYS ""TIFFANY TRANSCRIPTIONS"" RECORDED IN THE LATE 40'S EARLY 50'S WHICH WERE NOT RELEASED AS BOB WILLS RECORDS AT THE TIME, I THINK THEY WERE RECORDED TO BE BROADCAST ON RADIO PROGRAMS. I HAVE ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN OF THESE, GET THEM ALL IF YOU CAN FIND THEM ANYMORE. THESE ARE MY FAVORITE BOB WILLS RECORDINGS, BETTER THAN ANYTHING THEY LAID DOWN ON WAX, THESE RECORDINGS SEEM TO SWING MORE THAN THOSE OLD 78'S. BOB WILLS AND THE TEXAS PALYBOYS WERE ONE OF THE FIRST BANDS TO EMPLOY THE USE OF ELECTRIC GUITAR (WITH A BIG BAND!) AND AMPLIFICATION, AND FREQUENTLY USED TWIN GUITARS PLAYING THE MELODY, THEY WERE LIGHT YEARS AHAEAD OF THEIR TIME. NOT QUITE JAZZ, NOT QUITE COUNTRY, A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH, BUT DIFFERENT FROM EACH OF THEM."
3,"protects your headset jack, prevents inline mic & volume control","This is perfect for a regular headset for music players, but impairs smartphone use. If you use this with a phone headset, you won't be able to answer calls, change the volume, pause the song, etc. on your inline controller, so it's kind of inconvenient if you listen to music and/or make calls a lot on your phone. The mic still works during phone calls, though. I use this with a Sennheiser iPhone and Samsung Infuse 4G phone. I think protecting the headset jack from wear and tear offsets the inconvenience of having to take the phone out to change the volume or pause a song."
4,A return to favor.,"I hadn't liked some of their ""newer"" stuff (Mecca for Moderns, etc.), but this was the first album of theirs that I liked after I almost stopped liking them ... if that makes sense."
4,Another solid MT record,"Other reviews have hit some highlights, so let's talk trivia here: ""World Apart"" is a song Janis Siegel co-wrote with David Pack (of the underrated Ambrosia) about love and a life lost. She lost her unborn child during a pregnancy many years back, and this song is about that lost relationship.""Confide In Me"" was penned by Steely Dan's Donald Fagen. It sure sounds a little like Steely Dan, too. Great mid-tempo song - engaging and fun.All in all, this record is more ""pop"" in spots (in the arrangements) than most of their other records, but all is forgiven due to their masterful harmonies (as always).This is a great group to see in live performance, by the way. Don't miss 'em!"
5,The Perfect Companion,"For anyone who likes numbers, this book is a delight. Open it at random and find some fascinating treasure. Great for kids who are starting to reach out."
4,one of country's better,a varied collection of songs by original artistsranging from the 70's to the 80's not a bad buy
4,Works very well,"I subscribe to ProActiv, and it dosen't help me. At all. I have oily skin, too. So, I tried AcneFree Acne and Blackhead Terminator and I didn't expect any results. After just one week of using it, my skin has cleared up noticeably. When you first put it on, you can feel it working! You should try this for the price and for the results."
5,Oma's Quilt,A wonderful book for a family sending a grandparent to an assisted living.My granddaughters (8) & (5) really enjoy reading this book.
2,The Randy Rhoads Years: worth spending the money on?,"This was an early look at the work of Randy Rhoads before joining with Ozzy Osbourne. I personally think Laughing Gas was the best track because of the guitar solo. I can't really say much for the other tracks, though. I feel they were nothing but low budget 80's rock girlfriend/boyfriend songs. The guitar riffs throughout the cd are genious, but the lyrics truthfully take away from the guitar. I suggest finding a cheaper way to get Laughing Gas instead of going out and buying the cd. You could probably download it off a website...."
3,For the beginner,"As others have noted, the author tries to sell his software in this book. I was a beginner when I got the book and used some of what this book taught me to develop financial models. This book teaches the basics, and if YOU are a beginner, this is a great starting point. Then get deeper into the finance and move on to other books. This is a good addition to an apartment investor's library. If you are a seasoned investor, probably look elsewhere."
1,Broke in 15 minutes,"Opened up the yo-yo, was very pleased with its responsiveness to returns as well as the auto-return function. About 15 minutes into playing with it, the string got tangled (attempting a trick). I had to untwist the yo-yo to get the knot out and when I put it back together, the yo-yo stopped returning. I've attempted tightening the string but there's nothing I can do to get it to stay tight around the spool. Now, could this be user error? Possibly. However the yo-yo should still be able to auto-return which is does not. I'll change my review if I can get it working again and I find out my problem is due to user error."
4,Good little dictionary,"Haven't actually used it yet, but looks to be very functional, easy to read. Of note: check the size on what you're buying-- I expected a 4""x6"" like my French one by the same company, but this one is smaller (maybe 3""x4""?)."
2,not consistent,"It kind of did what it was supposed to do at first. Quit working without warning while trying to start grass seed. Bad deal and may have ruined 3 hard days of work and grass seed and manure costs. If you want water the first day, you have to manually water first and then go back and set time for next day (or whatever period). If you have a non critical area to water and will be home to check to make sure it gets done, great. Don't depend on this for serious watering or while out of town."
1,absolute piece of junk,"I bought this water timer last month to handle critical watering of my garden while on vacation. It is difficult to be sure of correct setup as mentioned in other reviews, but I did verify operation before leaving on vacation. At some point, the timer completely quit working and no watering occurred at that point. Batteries were new, and all directions were followed. It is waste of money to buy this product. Worse, you can suffer damage to plants that did not get watered."
3,Acceptable sub but...,"This battery is much lower cost than the Panasonic original, and it does work, but my impression is that the battery is lower in quality than the Panasonic original. It seems to run down faster than the factory original, even though it has the same mAH rating (or better). I get fewer photos before the low batt alarm comes on. But, it does work, and saves me real money, so I have mixed emotions."
4,Lenmar battery to replace Panasonic battery in Lumix camera,"The Lenmar battery DLP002 works well in my old Lumix FZ20 camera, with one caveat:After 4 years of use, the battery starts to swell and crack its case. Get new batteries when this happens. They cost about half the price of the Panasonic battery, which I lost, and will shoot nearly as many pictures per charge. A good buy for those who shoot a large number of pictures.By contrast, another, cheaper brand of Chinese battery only last about half as many shots when new, and only lasted about two months in service when rotating three batteries through the charger!"
2,Warranty Warning ---,"In addition to having to pay to return the products ....Lemnar will charge you a Shipping and Handling Charge of:$7.50 ($12.50 if Canada, International varies on location) per battery pack.$10.00 ($16.50 if in Canada, International varies on location) for each charger or tripodfor any warranty exchanges .... (PER BATTERY) The fail to mention this when they post thier 2 year warranty."
3,"One hell of a lot of $$ for a 3""X9"" piece of plastic","But, it makes my monster Milwaukee work with the Mast-r-lift, and that's a beautiful thing."
5,Simply Outstanding,"I came to this book because my family and I will be traveling to Normandy this summer. We plan to stay in Bayeaux and view the tapestry. The book delivered what I had hoped: a detailed survey of the tapestry that will no doubt simmer in my subconcious as I view the work itself. But along the way, Bridgeford offered so much more. After reading the book, I have a much greater sense of medieval history, including Charlemagne's role, the lives of knights, Britain and France's incestuous relationship, the origin of the Crusades, and the impact of the invading Vikings. The book was a pleasure to read for its gripping prose. A must if you plan to travel to Bayeux!"
4,An Honest But Bleak Journey,"Miller Packard plays games with himself. He pushes life right up to the edge and then balances there as long as possible. His life is a mess. When he meets black caddy Lionel ""Train"" Walk, he hasn't lost his propensity for drama and has discovered a talented young golfer prohibited by an invisible yet ever present color barrier.As the story progresses, complicated Packard strikes up a relationship with Nora, a woman who survives a terrible attack in which she is raped and two black men kill her husband. Tension builds when Packard begins to either expose or exploit Train's golfing talents for profit - neglecting Nora. Three lives dance in an ugly, circular motion.Climb aboard for a bleak ride through the lives of confused souls. In this well-written story, happiness seems an elusive proposition. This raw story is told without apology from a decidedly male perspective.Don't expect the journey to be pretty. Expect it to be honest."
2,Doesn't work,"The author tries to pull together a varied cast of characters,and from various periods of our history, and it doesn'tseem to work.There is much brutality presented, and old-time racism is atthe heart of much of the writing, but this book doesn't makeit very interesting."
1,Buyer Beware!,Don't buy this for $200. It's available for around $90 from amazon.co.uk including shipping to the US. The guy offering it for $200 is trying to rip you off!
2,Not that great.,"It's not that great. I thought it would be more heavy-duty but the connections weren't that tight. Plus it's heavy...very heavy, which I should have guessed since it's all metal. I would look for something with tighter connections."
4,Lighter than anticipated,A heavy duty design and not much heavier than a plastic equivalent. I weighed both a plastic RadioShack 3.5mm TRS female to female coupler and this same metal Hosa coupler using an accurate pelouze SP5 digital postal scale. The plastic model weighed in at 8 grams and the metal version weighed in at 10 grams. I don't find the additional 2 grams of weight of any real significance myself and the fit is no more slack than that of the RadioShack model.This is a very good device and I admire it's durable construction. Hosa's heavy duty adapters and connectors are well known by audio professionals for their high quality and durability. FYI - 3.5mm TS & TRS connectors are not generally considered to be 'professional' grade devices.SP5 Digital Postal Scale
5,Wonderful,"this product is wonderful, especially for little boys. My son went through 3 potty seats/toliets before we got this one. the lip on the front is great for little boys. we found a lot of potty seats/toliets are not ment for little boys. but this one is perfect."
3,Maybe better for girls?,"This potty seat fits the toilet fine, and seems comfortable to sit on. I think that the splash guard makes it a bit of a tight squeeze for my son to sit on the potty--we need to put him on carefully so as not to pinch anything. MIght be better suited for girls. We have a baby bjorn brand one for our downstairs toilet and it does not have the same issue."
2,Not a winner,"Bought this for my 2 year old daughter when she started showing interest in using the potty. I echo other's complaints that it is not good for elongated toilet seats & slides back when my daughter tries to sit down. However, my daughter's biggest complaint is that it is uncomfortable and cuts into the backs of her legs. The pee guard is not removable so if she sits on the potty with her pants around her ankles the pee guard cuts into her legs. If she sits on the potty seat without pants on (and thus can spread her legs wider) the padding compresses and the plastic ring of the potty cuts into her legs.The Elmo print is cute and my daughter loves Elmo but the design flaws have left me in search of a new seat that she likes more."
2,Moves around too much,"I won't recommend this seat because it moves around too much no matter what kind of toilet seat you it put on. Other seat that I purchased comes with non-skid/slide things that come with the seat that keeps the seat in place when your child sits on it, but this one has nothing to hold the seat in place and moves around way too much."
2,Not worth it-way too small for my boy.,"The guard on this seat is WAY too small for my 2.5yr old boy. I'm sure this would work fine for a girl, though."
3,Ok--not great for boys,"My son is almost 2.5 years old, and has been potty training for about a month. We have two potty seats---one for upstairs, one for downstairs. This one is decent--we have no problems with it fitting on our elongated toilet.However, be prepared to clean up pee if you use this with a boy! He has to sit just right in order to aim down and not get pee on the seat--I don't think the pee guard is high enough for use with boys. Also--if he 'aims' just right, pee gets under the seat, causing a mess on the regular toilet seat. I have to clean both seats every time I take this one off for adult use. It's easier for him to use it when he isn't wearing anything below the waist--he's better able to get his legs spread further apart for better support and aim.I think this would be better for girls--but someone has to get it right for boys!"
1,bad for elongated toilets and pee catcher cup is not high enough for boys!,i just bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son. it slides ALL over the place on my elongated toilet and the pee catcher cup is WAY too short so it wont even catch the stream unless he leans way forward and hangs over the toilet. im taking this back tomorrow and i will definitely be ordering the lightning mcqueen one with the larger pee catcher cup!: (
3,Not that good,"we really liked this seat- very cute- my kids liked it... they wanted to use it!! That was a good thing. However, it slides off the seat easy and doesnt always stay in place. It seemed very dangerous always sliding out from under them as they sat down. we eneded up not being able to use it."
3,"not bad, though a bit over-priced","the item is ok, though a little cheaply made. my son loved the super-heroes on it. Unfortunately it has failed to routinely coax poop from him!:) Though it did encourage him to sit on the pot, which is a certain victory w/in itself. We will keep using it and hope for the best."
1,Terrible.,"This seat elevates your kid so that (if he's a boy) the pee goes flying across the room. The regular toilet seat below gets dirty, and this seat has to be cleaned after every use. Get the one that Baby Bjorn makes."
5,Doo Wop Heaven,"I bought The Doo Wop Box for the love of a song -- ""Hearts of Stone"" by the Jewels. I heard it once on my sister's transistor radio when I was three years old. Maybe it was on Wolfman Jack. Maybe some DJ went gonzo bonkers and pulled it out of the vault. I don't know. I just fell in love with the raw,edgy feel of it; and I searched for that sound for 25 years.The Doo Wop Box is a must for any serious rock 'n' roll collector. When I listen to it, I marvel at the energy in the music -- and how the recordings have withstood the test of time. The archivists at Rhino really outdid themselves compiling the song list. All of the familiar groups are there (the Flamingos and the Skyliners and the Silhouettes) and so are some cool rarities, like ""Hearts of Stone.""I cannot reccommend this collection highly enough."
5,All time favorite.,Im glad the version I got was unrated because i think this movie would have definitely been worse if it was rated. Such a funny and awesome movie and I've probably seen it 100 times now! Good condition as well. Definitely worth it to buy!
2,"started off promising, then lost its way","This started off well enough, with the endearing James Franco and the always funny Seth Rogen as two potheads and a few comedic lines. Then it rapidly descended into goofy violence, gunplay, fights, frantic running around, screaming, and several characters that were not necessary and which added nothing to the story or the potential comedy. Too bad, because the Rogen and Apatow team is usually far better than this. Perhaps they were going for a spoof here, but it just fell flat.If you want to see something truly hilarious from them, try The 40-year-old Virgin extended cut."
2,Franco is great but....,"Franco sort of reminds me of Jeff Bridges, ""the dude"", from the big lebowski, too bad is paired with unfunny seth rogen, now if you like seth rogen, then bypass this review, but personally I do not find him funny. The jokes in this movie fell flat for me. If it was somebody else paired with franco besides rogen, then perhaps this movie might have worked. Look at shows like 2 1/2 men, perhaps the premise and some of the skits are not the most exciting, but the characters really drive the show. But if you like seth rogen, then skip this review."
1,Celebration of gun violence,"I tried this movie because I was expecting a little stoner humor. Instead I got a celebration of gun related violence; adults selling pot to kids and total disrespect for all police. Anyone who watched this movie and didn't know any better would assume that smoking pot and casually blowing someone away with a sawed off shotgun go hand-in-hand. After watching this, it only made me appreciate what a classic Cheech and Chong's ""Up in Smoke"" is. Will there ever be another?I was looking for a laugh or two. Instead I came away saddened that someone can think that resolving all of your problems with a gun is humorous."
3,"Pretty good movie, rent before you buy","This movie was pretty good, not as funny as what others have said. 2/3 of the way into the movie it started to drag some for me and wasn't as funny.Dialogue was clear throughout. Sound is directed from the front, little to no engagement of surrounds, maybe 2-3 scenes at most. There were missed opportunities to use surrounds in car chases and fight scenes. LFE was adequate for this movie. Video quality was good. I'd give it a rent before deciding to buy."
3,Great stoner flick - lousy deal from SONY,"Seth Rogan and James Franco rule. Frank is 'da man'. He reminds me of an old High School buddy I used to know - Jim. Nice as rice, but a classic stoner through and through. Thanks for the times, James.I bought this Blu Ray from Amazon a couple of months ago, expecting to have access to the digital copy. But no, it expired over a year ago. I contacted SONY, who said that ""Bonus Digital Copies are available for one year after the movie has been released to stores. Unfortunately, this title was released over a year ago and the digital copy is no longer available. On the back of the cover, the system requirements are listed for the download. There is a sentence that includes when the digital copy must be redeemed by.I would not call this stellar customer service at all. It gives me pause to purchase any SONY digital products. Amazon.com tried to make it right by offering a partial refund for me. I remain a loyal Amazon customer. Thanks. To SONY:BOO to YOU"
2,Annoying,"I enjoy Cheech and Chong movies, so I'm not not particularly biased to ""stoner-type"" films, and I will admit that there are some hilarious lines in this movie, but Seth Rogan's ""Ralph Cramden-isque"" voice, constant screaming and frenzied over-acting made me grimace throughout. I did enjoy the bizarre twists and unexpected violence amidst slapstick comedy, but the acting (overacting) was just too distracting for me to really enjoy this movie. Also the ""bro-mance"" was overdone - we get it guys, you are secure heterosexual males who aren't afraid to express your feelings, but again...overdone."
2,you need pineapple express to enjoy pineapple express,"Wasn't particularly interested in this ""stoner flick"" but checked it cause I heard a Terry Gross interview with James Franco. And Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow have been churning out some pretty good comedies haven't they. Well bottom line, this movie is just not that funny.~~~This review is dedicated to American Hero Michael Phelps whose decision to smoke pot in public at a party is actually amusing.~~~"
2,"Pineapple Express-Saw it on Cable. Not too funny, kinda bad Black Comedy.","The movie is long, At times funny, and Not entirely a stoner film per se, but pretty much bland. At least Cheech & Chong Is funny(I Don't do Drugs myself-which has nothing to do with it). But The movie plot is dumb. Don't see what the big deal is. I do have to hand it to Craig Robinson He is funny."
3,raw humor,"I just saw this movie on Blu-ray, and believe me it's hilarious. It never gets old. The fact it's coming from a probable pot-smoker makes it a whole lot more credible, and easier to relate to. The care-free story line is pretty neat, and one little incident just snowballs to a big adventure with Seth and his dealer, and later his dealers dealer. It's no half-baked, but its still one of the better chronic comedies out there.Just kick back, chill, and puff the magic dragon."
3,Buddy movie for slackers,"This movie is like Cheech and Chong meets ""Pulp Fiction"" with a little Jackie Chan action thrown in for good measure at the end. Very unusual combination of drug use, comedy and violence. But it works. Very few scenes where Rogan and Franco are not smoking pot or talking about smoking pot. Franco does a good job of channeling Spicoli from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" The middle man drug dealer does a good job and steals many scenes with his ""so unhip he becomes cool"" lingo. He is like the Energizer bunny, he gets beat up, shot and exploded...yet keep on ticking. There's an underlying sweetness that keeps the mood light, despite all the deaths that occur."
1,Waste of time!!!,Without a doubt the worst stoner movie ever made! Gives a bad name to weed! Even the best pot can't make this movie funny!
2,"Entertaining, but corny","I usually love movies like this, but this one was terrible. It kept me glued to the screen because it was so stupid. Never gonna watch it again. Might as well play frisbee with the DVD."
1,An Incredible Disappointment,"I am a huge fan of both director David Gordon Green (All the Real Girls and George Washington are superb pieces of cinema) and Seth Rogen, both as a writer and a performer, but this film is an incredible mess.Essentially it is a chase picture with no chase. None of the humor worked, the characters were annoying, the editing was terrible, and the action scenes were bland and uninspired.And the excuse that ""you don't smoke pot, therefore you won't get this movie"" is absurd. I didn't have to be a hit man to love Pulp Fiction. I didn't have to be an astronaut to love The Right Stuff. So don't fall for that idiotic argument. This is just a bad movie; pure and simple."
1,Don't bother watching,"I caught this one night on cable. Let's just say that two hours of my life I want back. I've seen a lot of Dolf Lungren movies that I've liked but this one was horrible. The acting was bad, the lines were bad, and the story was bad. It tries to be a Mad max type movie but fails misserably. I would give it zero stars if I could but I can't."
3,Good Worth seeing,Lungrin very good ... also Joe Burke ... why do we not see more of Joe Burke in more films??
4,Excellent Value,"I purchased the Raynox 250 Macro Lens for my Panasonic Lumix FZ8 and I am so impressed with the quality of the focus, it's like looking through a microscope! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good quality macro lens at an affordable price."
5,Superb product,I am extremely happy with this product and the quality it gives. This has taken my perspective of macro photography into new dimension itself. You can check the example shots taken using this attached to my Canon 90-300mm f/5.6 USM lens here on the link. ([...] )
5,EXCELLENT!,"I Had a Jumbled Mess of Containers, and Chinese Food containers etc.. and I Threw Them all Out, and Bought this. It fits well In My Pull Out cabinate and Makes it so NEAT and Organized Now! You can EASILY find the lids, and containers. Easy to Put away, and also cleans up well in dishwasher.! I am very Pleased with this. If You have really SMALL cabinates, you may want to measure, before Buying, the base does take up some space, But I dont find it a Problem."
3,either theres a defect or rubbermaid has gone down in quality,"I usually love rubbermaid products but when i received this set of tupperware half of the lids don't fit on the tubs! so out of 15 boxes, i really only have 7-8 that work. im hoping it's just a defect and i got unlucky. i would return it and just ask for a replacement but for 20 bucks i dont want to spend the money to return it."
2,Worked well for 2 months.,"Buying an ""official"" kickball, I thought we would enjoy years of use. Unfortunately, that was not the case. After the first couple of months, it was already very oblong. It sat in my garage over the winter and when practice came up in March, it developed a rip after 10 minutes of play. 4 patches later, it is in the garbage.Save your money and get a cheaper alternative."
3,It's a kickball,"I did not find this product to be superb. It is a ball that can be kicked. It has not lasted, however. I admit my friends and I have abused this ball. We leave it in the car and occasionally letting a 90-lb girl sit on it to protect her shorts from getting dirty. I have owned basketballs in the past. I know what the sun, particularly in South Florida, can do to inflatable objects, but the weather right now is mild, a mere 85 degrees inside the car with the windows up. The ball should have lasted longer than one month."
5,Life saver!!,This thing is running my sound from my HTPC audio out to my TV RCA audio in... I use it for any non-HDMI footage I pass through (such as HULU). This thing is my life saver.
5,very entertaining,It's exactly what I thought it would be. Marie Osmond is a gem. Very talented and charming.
1,Double loser.,"The product did not work. I bought it as a Christmas present, and since it was more than two weeks that the person received the product, Waste King refused to take the product back even though it was defective. The recipient said to just throw it away. He said it was a bad product and he didn't want it. $56.88 down the tubes."
5,Awesome CD - I love every song,"I had never listened to any Bare Naked Ladies before, except what I heard on the radio. I sought out the song ""One Week"" from the car commercial. It turned out this CD had the song I wanted. I have fallen in love with this group - their humor, their music - the tunes are all so catchy. It has made me a true fan and I will seek out new CDs of theirs and concert tours."
4,Mostly good CD,"These guys are pretty good musicians, the drummer stands out on several songs. Mostly pretty good songs, with some filler. I've listened to it over a dozen times, and I'm not tired of it, which is pretty high praise.jc"
5,"""Disc One"" is # 1!","Well, if it's not, it should be. I received this album for my birthday, conveniently coinciding with the release date. As a BNL fan, I am completely swept away. This has got to be the greatest possible compilation of songs by this awesome group. From the upbeat ""One Week,"" to the reflective ""What a Good Boy,"" and all of the gems in between, ""Disc One"" resonates with the truest BNL sound. The inside blurbs on each song are a plus. I think that this album is sure to please adamant and casual fans alike. (PS Be sure to check out the two brand new songs - ""It's Only Me"" and ""Thanks That Was Fun""!)"
1,Great for removing paint from your walls!,"I purchased Shurtape off the shelf at Lowes. No particular reason why I chose this brand. It certainly wasn't the cheapest. I used it to edge two walls I was painting in one room. The other walls I was leaving the original color. I applied two coats of paint, one on Friday night and the other coat the following morning. I allowed several hours to dry. When I pulled the Shurtape off I had nice clean lines, but also exposed drywall where the tape had been removed. It pulled the paint right off the walls. Not the new paint, the original paint on the walls that I didn't paint were the ones damaged. Now I have to paint the other walls as well. I certainly won't be using Shurtape for that job."
5,Simply Great!,Great soulful sounds with dynamite blending. BUY IT!!! I loved the songs with all sisters included. Also the part with her daughter and Twinkie on keyboard gave me CHILLS! Beautiful ladies inside & out.
5,This Video will open your heart to the power of God,Karen Clark Sheard is truly the most amazing vocalist I have ever heard. This album and video give you a taste of this woman's extraordinary talent. I just saw her live in NYC and I can't describe how excellent she was. Karen's voice and the Clark Sisters have lifted me higher and helped me strenghthen my faith and ability to connect with God! Get this video!
2,Waste of time,I bought this for one of my nieces who loves crafts. I thought it would be a good way for us to share some time and make something we could actually use. Making friendship bracelets is just more complicated than I remember. The beads and accessories are cheap looking and the strings are difficult to handle. You definitely need an adult to help you with these projects. I just feel we wasted a lot of time unraveling string and looking for beads. Time we could have spent outside playing hopscotch. Don't bother with this product.
4,Smooth Magic,"A lovely and smooth recording by one of the best voices in pop. I've been a fan for decades and this is a nice addition to my collection with some new and reworked tunes. Not ""Angel Clair"" but close."
3,Pleasant - not particularly noteworthy,A nice CD to add to your collection. Not as strong as the two previous offerings.
5,The Desert Song,"Coyote is the best song I have ever heard from MK. It simply isthe best song on the entire album, typically the horns are my favorite in that song. That is a track I could play over n overagain. Great song. One of my favorite songs of all time. I alsocall it ""The Desert Song"", because It's great for the Desert."
1,Disappointment,"As a huge fan of Mark Knopfler since the first Dire Staits Album, it's time he moved on from the Nashville scene to create music that more cutting edge. No great and memorable music here, just a rehash of the lesser known songs from ""Sailing to Philadelphia"". I wish I could be more positive..."
3,yawn,"Good thing there's strong coffee to drink while listening to this. Thought-provoking lyrics, but nothing with the passion I'm used to from MK. It's just too sedate. Mark give us some original licks. At least throw in something impressive. Too laid back, sorry."
5,One of the Best Discs of 2002!,"Knopfler, the Dire Straits frontman has released one of the freshest discs of the year. It's top knotch song writing and music at its best.Knopfler has a knack of combining great storytelling and fine music together.Each song on this disc has a folk-country feel to them. Each telling a different tale of life of the working class.The disc starts out with ""Why Aye Man"" a toe tapping tune that's very reminiscent of a Dire Straits song. It tells the story of men who travel to Germany to find work because jobs are scarce in their native countries. ""Hill Farmer's Blues"", ""Quality Shoe"" and most of the tracks on this disc are odes to the working class.Mixed with Knopfler's fine guitar playing and distinctive voice this cd is well worth a listen. Give it a listen!"
2,Not Up to His Best,"This is not a very interesting album. Someone else wrote that it was the soundtrack of a movie and that's sort of what it sounds like. WAY in the background of a movie.He has a lot of better stuff. For instance, I like every recording on Shngri-La. Can't say that I will play this one again."
3,Does what it is supose to do Delivery was great!,Adapter. What more can be said? It does what it says. The delivery and shipping was unbeatable.
1,minimal fun for 2 minutes,"this toy was very exciting for my 4 year old to receive but after about 2 minutes of pushing the button and making it roar and move, that was it. fun was over. he has not touched it in months and choices instead to play with other non-animated dragons he has instead."
5,I enjoyed this album immensely,"I suspect negative reviews reflect the listener's feelings about cuss words in current songs. Well, if you can't stand the heat, get out of the room, in my opinion. There is always Beetoven if you don't want the words.Toby's music is full of raw energy and the words spoke to me. Keep meaningful music coming, please. We have a plethora of old love songs to keep us busy already."
2,Do Not Buy - Very Poor Design,The hose for this is in two very stiff sections. When you try to adjust even a little bit the hose comes apart way too easily. There are other designs that have a one piece hose which would work much better. The only good thing in this is the bracket to attach it to the DP.kDrill Press Dust Collector
5,great movie,"it shows these 3 diva's at the beginning of their careers. dvd could be better, but its great"
4,Highly Entertaining,Extremely well done and highly entertaining. The casting was perfect and the performances were dead-on.
1,Did not work for me.,"Pros: The splitter cable was not very expensive and Amazon shipped it super-fast in some excellent packaging.Cons: I bought this with the intent of simultaneously plugging (2) guitars into my signal path for fast on-stage instrument changes. I am disappointed by the results:1) The cable seems to have a short in it. When I move it, the signal cuts in & out.2) When I do get a signal, tone and volume are both adversely affected, (I don't think this is due to the short but I suppose it may have something to do with it).3) The instrument that is not currently in use has to have the volume knob turned up or I get no signal from the guitar hanging around my neck - which completely defeats the purpose of what I'm trying to accomplish.Other Thoughts: I could personally live with #1 since that's easily solved by re-purchasing or doing an exchange. However, #2 & #3 make this cable unusable for my purposes. Be aware of these issues before you buy one of these!"
4,description not so clear,"I ordered this product to use at church. I should've read the full description. I was eager and excited to resolve a problem but because the two female parts were MONO and not STEREO as I thought they would be, I can not use the item and will now have to order another. I am not angry but it was disappointing."
2,Save Your Money,"I suppose that if you know nothing of WBTS music, this will do. That is about it. The scores and the mixes are cacaphonous, in the style of '50s musicals. In fairness, it may be only a matter of taste; I like WBTS music the way the men might have heard it, or even occasionally, the way civilians might have heard it at a show or gathering. This work is none of that. This is WBTS music the way a mid-twentieth century American would have it. It simply isn't real."
4,Very cute!,"Arrived in record time, seller even wrote a thank you note! Clearly labeled fragile. Doll is unique but very tiny. Glad it had free shipping. Only wish Toto was more like the real Toto, black hair, furry. Great gift for that Wizard of Oz lover!"
3,Strongly suited for parents,"In Gardner's view, truth, beauty, and good are the pillars upon which an education striving for deep, profound understanding should stand. Throughout the book he offers the examples of Darwin's Origin of Species, Mozart's Marriage of Figaro, and the Holocaust as possible case studies in order to achieve this goal. His plan is persuasive in its scope and ideology, and attempts to reach all children through espousing the theory of multiple intelligences and several ""pathways"" to educational success. In sum he is bolstered in theory, but thin in implementation. For parents, ""The Disciplined Mind"" seems an excellent source through which to guide ones' children. For educators, it seems overly ambitious, practically requiring a paradigm shift in the educational bureacracy."
1,Total garbage,"That's what this game is. I've been a hardcore gamer since I was 5 and I've learned to appreciate a good game even if it first appears bad. I gave a fair shot at this game, but it is way too simple to be any fun. Their is no way to customize your character - armor, weapon, etc. The enemies are all the same and by the way I sold it a week after i bought it"
3,Great multi player game...disturbing story line,"Gauntlet Legends is a great multi player game if you have the friends. It does get boring as a single player, fast. The graphics are less than spectacular (as with ALL Midway Dreamcast games), but the sound is passable. The game has a disturbing story line which is kind of a turn off and if not for that it would be a great game.Worth getting if you play it as a multi player, if not then you can let it slip under the radar"
2,Mindless entertainment,"If you're idea of fun is holding down the attack button and simply obliterating everything around you indescriminately, then you'll love gauntlet legends. Honestly, it quite simply is mindless. The graphics are great, and if you liked the original, you'll be nostalgic. However, there really isn't anything to challenge your gaming ability. Typically, bosses in this sort of game are tough and you need to learn strategies to beat them. I do not jest in the least when I say that I beat every single boss (including the final one) by holding down the attack button and standing in front of it. It's just that easy. There are 8 characters and 4 hidden ones. However, it's the same game over and over, no randomization, nothing really tailored to different characters. After winning the game, doing it again with another character is as much fun as painting your house, letting it dry, painting it again, letting it dry and then painting it again. Gets old pretty darn quick."
4,Gauntlet Legends,"The game was cool!!!! it had monsters and i could kill them and i ran by caves and fire came up from the ground i played it with my friend, BUY IT!!!!"
3,A Fcuking good idea!,"The concept of this album is interesting and quite original in its on way. Two French producers take 13 post punk classics from groups such as XTC, The Clash and The Cure, strip away the original music and replace it with Bossanova rhythms. Then get eight women who have never heard of the songs before to sing them. The result is a classy sounding album and, although this project has a whiff of novelty, it is pulled off perfectly. If you don't believe me listen to their version of Joy Division's `Love will Tear us apart' and you'll be converted."
3,it's an ok mouse. u might be better off with a USB one.,the only advantage this mouse have is Bluetooth so u don't have an extra dongle to stick in your usb port for wireless.I got this and I got a USB logitech wireless N200 mini mouse.this thinkoutside BT mouse is ok but not greatGOOD:- connects quickly.- pretty small- since it's BT no extra receiver dongle to carry around.BAD:- since it's small it's kinda hard to press the scroll wheel button- not nearly as accurate as the logitecn N200 and not percise/refresh fast enough.- battery don't last as long as say the logitech or my other wireless mouse.I wouldn't recommend doing any gamming on this mouse.
1,"Poor Quality, Stay away from this mouse.",I bought this mouse and the quality of construction is very poor. The battery cover keeps popping off. The power switch located on the bottom of the mouse is poorly constructed and seems like it will break at any time. In addition the power switch on the bottom does not slide easily. I am not happy with this product.
4,Pretty Good but...,"it's a bit too hard even if you put it on Easy mode. However, the game do have features that makes it stand out. The designs of the environments are nice and clean. The way wolverine slashes and cling to the wall makes you think of the X-men movie that's because that's exactly how wolverine moves! I think this would've been a perfect game if it wasn't too hard and if only you don't hear those alarm sounds that come off on almost each stage of the game, it gets really annoying at times."
5,great mosturizer,"I have really dry skin and use mosturizer daily on my entire body, the scent is not overpowering and pleasant. I really was impressed with the pump that came with the bottle, it is more of a refilling pump, but it is very sturdy and you just have to adjust your pressure when dispensing. A great winter lotion because of its thick consistency. This lotion is a keeper and well worth the money."
5,"When my kids were sick, this was one of two books we always read...","My children, now 19 and 17, loved this book. I guess they were about 6 and 4 when I got it. Whenever they were sick, we read this book and a Sesame Street book called ""It's No Fun to be Sick."" Reading these books became a comforting ritual, as well as an easy way to learn some basic science."
5,Excellent biography,"This is an excellent book, both in content, and quality.The author, Stanley Frodsham, was a friend of the Wigglesworth family, and of Smith himself. He was the family's choice biographer for Smith. Further, a large portion of the book is autobiographical as Frodsham dictated much of the story from Smith, himself. Other segments were dictated by close friends and family of Smith. Even testimonials shared were first hand accounts.This is an excellent biography, which I would take as the leading authority on Smith's life, due to the legitimacy of first hand sources.I highly recomend this book, as it tells many great triumphs of a powerful man of God, who lived his life by faith in Christ. Smith was a powerful minister and healing evangelist, who was used of God to deliver many kept in bondage to satan, to heal many ravaged by disease, and even to raise the dead. Biographies such as this one reveal what miracles God can do in the life of an average person if only we have faith."
4,Nemo's Back,"This is a well designed, high qualty annimation ScreenSaver for a low price. If you like Aquariums you will like this no-maintenance version. There is more you can do with selecting the scenes and the fish you like, which I haven't yet tried."
5,Marine Acquarium Screensaver,Just like the one I've seen at Fry's. Fish look great and it's fun to see what the starfish is up to. A fine product.
3,"Information-good, book quality-poor.","This is a book that will appeal to any Tarzan fan, loads of information and rare details. The author is very pro Johnny Weismuller, which is fair enough as Weismuller played Tarzan more times than anyone else. He states that 'Tarzan and his Mate' is the best Tarzan movie of all time, not a point of view that I share but the author's comments and reasons are well put together. The major fault of this book is the poor quality of the materials - paper quality is poor, black and white photos on newsprint, no glossies or colour shots and as a result the book is grossly over priced. Avid fans will enjoy it but Gabe Essoe's 'Tarzan of the Movies' is a better buy."
1,poor quality,"I had ordered this DVD because my daughter loves this particular episode. I had to return the first copy I received because it froze at a specific point each time she watched it. It also had auditory problems at that point as well. I received a repalcement DVD right away. However, this DVD is performing in the exact way as the one I returned. I am disappointed, will return this one, and am hoping that the third one will work properly."
3,Movie Fan from NY is right!,"The Kid does NOT meet Forrester over the Internet. The reviewer needs to got back to Movie Review School. Can't believe he/she would miss this. ""NY Fan"" calls it right again about the choice between writing and his friends. Score is nice compliment to story. Too bad we never get to hear Forrester reflect on the importance music is to writing. It would make for a nice touch."
5,Great product and great service,Received the product on time and it was exactly as advertised. Thanks a million for the great service and great product.
3,Roadside Kit,I have not had a chance to use the item but when opened all items were there and it looks to be a good item.
4,Only one reservation - be careful doing the exercises.,"Overall, a very informative book, as everyone else says. My only reservation - be careful doing the exercises in the book. The author also has a warning about this - he says ""at no point during your back exercise program, should you feel that you are straining...to the point of significantly increasing your pain.""I tried doing a lot of the exercises in the book, and it did add to my pain, so I then got a referral to a physical therapist, who then worked with me, showing me the 9 exercises that were best for me - using the big exercise ball. Those exercises (and perhaps the glucosamine that I take) have gotten me back to where I can again play badminton once a week, and no longer have the serious back pain I had before. (The book does mention, of course, the possibility of getting help from a physical therapist.) I'd recommend the book - just don't increase your pain by overdoing the exercises - as the author warns, in that chapter."
4,GOOD GAME FOR 20 BUCKS,"I heard nothing about this game when it came out a year ago and I found it in a bargain pile at Walmart for $20 so I decided to give it a try. Well its pretty damn good considering its price and that I didnt even hear about it when it first came out. The characters and the story arent exactly as ""cool"" as say Resident Evil 4 or God of War type games, in fact the characters are kind of geeky. But the gameplay is awesome a lot of fun with tons of moves and obstacles and action from te beginning to the endof the game. Controls are tight and well done. I recommend this game to anyone if they see it in the store give it a try like i said the charcters and the story might not be so cool but the gameplay is."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"After searching many stores, I found exactly what I wanted on Amazon. Many stores only sell plastic dish drainers and I wanted to rubber coated metal and the size is perfect for my sink."
4,Guitar Drenched Psychy Proto Prog,"Late 60's early 70's NYC power trio with experimental ambitions.I don't know why this is not better known.Lots of great guitar playing snaking around very modern sounding songs, not dated sounding. Instrumental guitar remake of Bach's ""toccata"" is excellent, not a novelty. Sixteen songs nothing longer than 6 minutes, guitar driven with great finese. Psych is the flavor with musical boundary exploring the ambition. Very tasteful musicianship.Some of it even sounds like a harder edge Vini Reilly/Durutti Column.A definite must for the adventureous listener, particularly of psych and proto-prog."
5,Modern Prog Rock at its Best,"This is a fantastic offering from The Reasoning.Excellent vocals with three distinct vocalists flowing seamlessly. The melodies and musicianship are great. They remind me of Pure Reason Revolution - another prog band that mixed male and females vocals. If you like PRR at all, you like like this. The sound is very listenable, yet not oversimplified.My favorite is ""Fallen Angels"", but really I listen to the entire album from top to bottom.Five stars all the way. Hopefully they will become more well known and continue to make great music."
4,Intellectualy Stimulating,"This film explores all of the theories about the origin of the universe. The scientists interviewed to explain the theories are credible, even though some are difficult to understand because of heavy accents. Arno Pensius is especially accurate when he explains that any scientist can invent a theory and then it becomes the responsibility of others to disprove it. If you love physics and science you will love this film. If you have ever trully wondered where and how it all began you will appreciate the metaphysics aspect. I purchased one copy from another source and am ordering a second copy to give to a friend."
4,Excellent Primer,"This book is a very good introduction to installing your own multi-function vehicle PC. Using this guide anyone with reasonable computer and car audio skills should be able to install a working system. It is written at the basic to intermediate level; I have just finished installing my second system and although much of the information was known to me, I still picked up some new and useful tips. People looking for more advanced information and ideas should spend some time at the MP3Car forums. Many of the contributors to this book are prominent members of the carputer community and know their stuff."
4,Relentless headhunter,"Christian Slater plays the corporate headhunter 'Vincent Palmer' who is so relentless and obsessed at keeping his record of 'always getting his man' that he'll stoop to murder to get the job done. When this pill popping nightmare pursues family man Ben Keats, the game gets very ugly. A different type of thriller with a unique type of 'stalker'.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
5,Great Music,What can be said about Paul Anka? All of his music is just the best. I never get tired of listening to him and this CD has all his best songs.
3,Error,"Everyone credits Paul Anka for being the author of 'MY WAY' That is wrong,the song's composer was a french guy by the name of Thibault,and the first singer was Frenchman named 'Claude Francois,[dead now]!"
4,"If you had to recreate society, what would you do?","This is a book that challenged the idea of what is nurture and what is nature. Can Eve, the only surviving adult overcome what may be innate human greed and desire to control other living things? Or are this ""perfect generation"" of children nothing more than better at domination than those who genetically engineered them? This book made me take many second looks at the world around after I read it as a teenager."
3,OK,"This wasn't the best Shawn Colvin recording, but it's still Shawn Colvin. When she isn't at her best, she's still AMAZING!"
2,Disappointed. Doesn't stay in place.,"I have been really disappointed with this product so far. I concur with several other reviews that it is difficult to insert, but with some patience and a little lube, it is manageable. The problem I have with it is that the neck between the base and the balls is too wide, and the product finds a way to slide back out. I think that if the neck were narrower, it would stay in better. Back to the drawing board for me."
3,I hated it!,I thought it would be cool but i found out it wasn't the greatst but a fun game for a while. it;s just after beating it i get boring! but its a good game
5,Awesome Funny Movie,"This was a funny movie. I like both actors in other movies and the pair make a great combo. Extra's on the blu-ray disc are ok, nothing great. Good movie quality and good sound quality."
3,21 Jump Street preview,21 Jump Street is absolutely hilariously funny. I thought this was the movie but it's just a 10 minute preview.
2,what a MESS !!!,"This movie was a mess, a co-working said he couldnt stop laughing and it was suppose to be such a great movie.. Well i was highly disapointed, it was only slightly smarter than the lastest batch of teen spoof movies and lampoon garbage (long disgracing the lampoon's title Chevy Chace helped create) Back on topic this had the potential to be such a funny movie, and it simply tried to hard on most fronts, i thought the funny stuff felt forced and the story line was sloppy, Rapper ice cube played the Captain and he came across as way to angry of a ""angry black man"".. I could go on and on but in short i guess im happy i only spent a dollar to rent it, im more upset i wasted my time watching it.. 2 stars for a few, and i do mean a few mild laughs.."
1,21 Jump Street,"I know it's rated R, but I expected more humor than cussing. That was not the case. To me it seemed that the writers may have been going for a record of how many F-bombs they could put in a movie. The cussing was really unecessary. This could have easily been a PG-13 film if the producers weren't so excited about every cuss word in the book."
3,Entertaining,Comical. It pokes fun at the differences between the decades of high school students.Funny stuff.I laughed.I'm glad in watched it.
2,Engh,Could have been a good movie was really funny but all the swearing really distracted from the funny. Then them swearing in a church like that was extremely disrespectful. They really need to stop making movies with all the language I'm 21 and and almost walked our of the there on this movie the language was so bad.if you have no problem at all with hearing the fbomb literally every other word this movie might be funny for you. But if you are bothered at all by language even just a little I don't recommend this one.I don't understand why they have to put so much sex and language in movies even kids movies now all have at least one swear word it's rediculous I hate it.
4,Just a fun movie,"If you're looking for high-brow entertainment, try The King's Speech. But if you're looking for a laugh, give this a try. It's fun, it's funny and it doesn't play down to the audience. Not recommended for young kids."
5,Funny,The movie was very funny. Online quality of HD was awesome. Very easy to order and very quick to load.
4,Funny-as it should be,The end threw me off in a not-so-good way. I did not want or need to see Johnny Depp's face in this movie.
4,pretty funny but don't want to hype it up,pretty funny but I don't want to hype it up. Good movie to just relax and laugh at. Acting was ok and characters were believeable.
4,GREAT MOVIE!,"This movie was supper funny! I just picked it up today at K-Mart... apparently cheaper here on Amazon. I loved it! But I don't right reviews for just about anything, I write them when I am made and I am made at the digital copy you get. You can't do much with it, I really wanted to put it in iTunes, but you can't you have to use their software. I want to have it with all my other digital movies! If they want to stop piracy, you don't do something like this, offer a digital copy but then put a lot more restrictions on it! But the movie was 5 stars but I dropped on for the digital download offered."
1,21 Jump Street,"If I could give this movie zero stars I would. I have never taken the time to write a movie review because I generally enjoy most movies. I decided because this movie was so bad, if I could spend 5 minutes writing a review to hopefully prevent someone from wasting 90 minutes of their life, like I did, it would be worth the time. Please don't waste your money. I rented this because I was a fan of the tv show. This is the worst remake of any tv show I have ever seen. If you enjoy throwing your money away, why don't you waste your money on the lottery or some scratch tickets instead of this movie. The odds of you winning money with your lottery tickets are about as good as you actually enjoying this movie...about 1,000,000 to 1."
4,21 Jump Street,Pretty funny....worth renting. But glad I didn't pay to see in theater. Would've been awesome if they would've put old cast from tv show in there more.
5,Hilarious,"I love this movie. It's absolutely hilarious and I got it on a Black Friday Lightening Deal, so it was impossible to pass up!"
5,Funny,"LMAO...I started watching this moving on the plane and had to come home and finish watching it. I was skeptical about this moving and didn't bother to watch it in the theater, but was happy that I did end up seeing it now. It is not a type of humor for everyone...it is like Will Ferrell humor is not for everyone."
2,2 lewd!,"At the beginning of this year I bought 21Jump from the 80s on a whim at Bed, Bath & Beyond... Got into it so bought the full 5 seasons on Amazon.What a sad follow-up to the original wholesome series this film is! Such a shame its so lewd.Every other word is grossly profane, why? The actual plot is okay but its filled with mess.ps,Johnny Depp's cameo was severely disappointing. He follows suit with the cursing and is super foul in his 5 minutes on screen. Sign of the times?Its one redeeming feature is getting to see the original Doug Penhall cameo - naturally, he's still the same sweetheart!But not redeeming enough to keep me from tossing it out.= $ wasted."
1,It wasn't what I thought...,"It wasn't what I thought it was going to be. The commercials may look great, hilarious, and amazing, but it's not at all what you expect. It's crude throughout the whole thing, there's a cuss word every other word, and it just doesn't make you laugh all that much. The commercials were literally the only parts that were good."
1,Garbage....,"This has to be one of the worse movies out there at the moment. I wanted to like it, but was totally dissapointed. I never knew that they were letting teenagers write scripts in Hollywood. Every other word or phrase was like hanging out with a 13 year old. Come on guys grow up, you could have done so much better."
4,Enjoyable,"It was fun seeing the cameos of all the original TV stars. Not going to win an Oscar, but fun for what it was."
5,What a relief!,For anyone who has ever had plantar faciitis these heel seats are two little miracles in your shoes! They provide almost instant relief from that stabbing and debilitating pain in the heels. I am thrilled with my results and highly recommend this product. I saved money buying the heel seats through Amazon because of lower pricing and free shipping. My order was delivered quickly and in good condition.
5,HTP Heel Seats,"While I had a cortisone shot a couple months earlier I still had discomfort. I heard about this product from a friend and the ""ridge"" in the cup intrigued me that it would provide acupressure and in essence keep the tendon stretched while walking. WOW what a difference. I can see I am getting better as when I do not have the heell seats in my pain is almost gone. Hopefully in a few more weeks I may not need to wear them at all but since they feel good - I may just continue to for preventive medicine! Great - smart product."
4,Definitely helping!,"I've been experiencing some major heel pain that I self diagnosed as plantar fasciitis (if it's not it, it's a lot like it.) So in attempt to self-cure it, I ordered these inserts. I've been wearing them in every pair of shoes they fit in--sneakers, heels, flats--for the last 2 1/2 weeks. And while the heel pain lessened, I wasn't sure if they were really doing anything because I was still experiencing some minor pain. So yesterday I decided to go insert free. The return of the pain and stiffness this morning was excruciating! Lesson learned. They are helping!"
2,heel seats,I have a bad heel spur. I bought these heel seats. I thought these seats would stop some of the pain. the heel seats are just waste of money and did not stop the pain. Still have heel spur pain for a year pain is still their.
1,I would not purchase again,"I thought that I would give these a try based on the positive reviews. Well, I feel like I just wasted $25!! Not only do they not make my foot pain any better, but, because they are made of a rubberie material, they make my feet sweat and smell bad. So, now instead of just having foot pain, I have foot pain AND stinky feet!!! I would not purchase again!!!"
2,Your shoes won't fit with this product inserted.,The heel seats made all of my shoes 1/2 size too small since they take up some room in the heel section. I didn't want to go buy a bunch of new shoes to use this product.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered these 'heel seats' because my sister, my daughter and my nephew all swore by them. I was mildly disappointed. Unless my issue was so severe that it's going to take a long time, I haven't seen too much improvement. I'm not saying there hasn't been ANY, because I do feel some relief, but it's been about a month, and I was told that it would be almost immediate. THAT sure wasn't the case.I will keep wearing them because they do help some, and I want to see if, in time, I see complete relief."
