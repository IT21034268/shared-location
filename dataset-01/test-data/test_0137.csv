5,Great Watch At a Great Price,"Bought this watch to replace a 15 year old casio. I read the reviews on it and decided to purchase it. It arrived in a timely manner and was just as advertised. It is sharp looking, light weight, easy to operate and keeps accurate time. It is ""masculine"" in appearance and can be worn worn every day while still maintaining its ""classic"" appearance. It is priced right.....saw the same watch on a competitors page for triple the price. I am glad with this purchase.....it is a great watch sold at a great price!!!Casio Men's GW530A-1V G-Shock Atomic Tough Solar Watch"
3,Didn't last nearly as long as I'd hope...,"So this watch treated me well for the most part. I took it scuba diving in South FL and it held up as advertised (dove to 110ft only though). It synchronized well with the atomic clock in Colorado when I wanted it to. BUT, its now dead after owning it for ~5 yrs. It does not hold a charge well even though it registers as being FULLY charged and dies out on me at night when I go running which is extremely irritating when I'm trying to track my time. I was under the assumption that being solar powered would keep the battery running for a lifetime. Guess I was wrong! Otherwise, it was definitely a decent watch."
5,Quality Watch @ a reasonable price,I've had one of these before and it lasted for years before giving up. I would highly recommend this watch.
1,Great watch til it stops working.,"I loved this watch. Wore it for 2 years. Watch eventually wouldn't hold a charge and went blank. Now here's the problem: You can't just go into any jeweler and buy a new battery. If you send it back to Casio, it costs almost as much as I spent for the watch. So what do people do? They toss them. Fantastic technology cheap. But the battery is the weak point."
1,Never received the refund for this item from Amazon,I ordered this item on Dec. 10. Supposedly Amazon made the refund immediately for this item as it was no longer in stock. I never got the refund. They say they sent it. This is not the only refund they sent to who knows where. Amazon is a crapshoot. Beware when buying any product from them.
1,Confused,"I have not purchased the watch yet. This is because I am confused about the size of the case diameter. The details/specifications indicate 46+ milimeters, but one of the photos, the one including an scale, show about 40+ milimeters ?! What would be the actual size of the case diameter ?"
5,good quality watch,"This is a newer version of the watch I owned. Sadly I killed the old one with extreme temperature fluctuations, but after being abusve to the watch for over 5 years, I think it was worth it. I like the fact that it will Auto synchronize the time, as well as being solar powered.The updated design is a little smaller around the connection from the face to the band. The previous model did rub on the bones in the wrist, but this model does not, so that is a major plus.Having had years of experience with the previous design, I find no flaws with this watch. It is a rugged sports watch that I wear outdoors in many different settings. Working on a farm, I am rough with most everything, and this watch holds up extremely well."
2,too much hassle,Two things made me return this watch to be replaced with the Casio G-shock Tough Solar (which is great)-I didn't like having to take the watch at night and point out out a window to receive the radio signal to keep correct time (or have to wait while I mannually did it during the day)-I didn't like the idea of having something on my wrist that is receiving radio waves-maybe there are no risks(cancer etc) but didn't want to risk itOverall-the watch seem very high maintenace just to keep the time-would not recommend it
3,Skechers,"Skechers Bikers-SpokesAre comfortable at first, but fit strange. Almost feel too big, like they will slide off the heel, but my toes/feet hurt at the end of a day, almost like they are too small. Not crazy about the velcro. I have a feeling the velcro piece will get stretched out over time and not fit snug any longer. They do look nice though."
1,Pieces poorly cut,"Wanted this puzzle for my lady since she LOVES Bernese Mountain dogs. When we got around to putting it together, we found that the pieces were so poorly cut that we couldn't tell without actually turning the pieces over whether they fit or not.Further, there was at least one piece missing from the puzzle.Would not recommend!"
3,legends,"The cd arrived with a very broken case, and the pictures for the cover were so wet they couldn't be opened. I was disappointed in the condition, but it plays fine, which is the important part."
4,Great trial lawyer,"There could have been a more thorough explanation of certain cases. There were many questions left unanswered, but still a very informative read of a world gone by. The exegesis of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire trial was fascinating, but still left some questions of the event unanswered. I recommend this book even though the price for it was ridiculous. If you have deep pockets go for it."
4,Get Ready To Sweat,This workout is awsome. Leslie really know how to get your heart going and keep you positive through out your whole work out. She even makes you want to come back the next day. Truely an awesome workout!!
4,Sweatin' Off the Pounds,I have done Leslie's workouts in the past and I like this one the best. You will definitely sweat. It is long. It's not your typical 20 min. workout; it's more like 45 mins. It does incorporate strength training which attracted me to it. I'm sure if you did this product and watched your calorie intake you would lose weight. I wish I was more disciplined when it came to exercising. :) I do recommend this product. You will definite sweat and burn calories!
3,Good lazy day work-out,"I have never worked out to her other tapes, I went straight to the 3 mile. I work out often so this routine was not difficult for me. I did not even break a sweat. Afterwards, I did feel a little burn in my thighs, but that is because I squated more in the workout than Leslie called for. This is not enough of a work out for my daily use, but, it will be real nice on the days when I just don't have the energy for a full blown workout.I found Leslie to be nice but not annoying."
4,Fat Burning Workout,All in all I think this exercise really keeps me going. I know some folks complain about her sense of humor but I can overlook that. I have slimmed down and lost inches doing Leslie's workouts. The product is well worth the investment. This is great for the middle aged group! I have also done her 4 mile workout and I find it beneficial as well.-
4,Not bad,"I bought this video with the intention of using it everyday for exercise. It is not a bad video, but there is definatly a lot of talking on it. It does get a bit corney at times, but overall the workout is not that bad. There is a section of this workout where you can use some weights, but it is not necessary. The steps are very simple and do not take up a lot of room."
4,Hunting Bramblesex,"""The Last Heroes"" was a very congenial diversion from the 4 a.m. cell-phone ramblings of my dissonant next-door neighbor. The ending was entirely unexpected yet WASN'T a blemish to the over-all excellent quality of the tale. Yes, we ALL miss Gil Kane...fortunately, his spirit soars in voluble hue with this book. MAZEL TOV."
3,Did not arrive as early as it could have.,"It was a Christmas gift. She likes reading nonfiction ghost stories so I gave her a view by this writer, she has not told me she doesn't like it, so I assume she is enjoying the book. Sorry this could not be a real review."
3,Beginners,"This video is for beginners. I'm an intermediate to advanced and found that this video is to slow and doesn't challenge my muscles. I didn't even break a sweat, not even when I increased my weights.Great for beginners though."
5,Best ever!!,"This is one of the best Buffy seasons ever, if not the best. Great villians, great plots, great stories, and Buffy's best bf ever!"
5,The best season....,"of ANY show EVER! Having defeated The Master a sullen Buffy must now do battle Spike and Drusilla, who are like a psychotic vampiric Romeo and Juliet. Also Buffy must deal with her growing attraction to Angel, an attraction that will lead to deadly consequences. Everybody brought their A-Game to the table, the writers did an excelent job crafting the seasons main storyline with plenty of shocking twists and turns. The actors all turned in excelent performances, especially Sarah Michelle, anybody who doubts her acting abiities must have never seen this show. Overall if you're looking for a quality show to watch you can't go wrong with Buffy season 2. EP"
2,Wasn't what I was expecting.,"A couple of the disks I think were copies off somebody's computer or something. You could only really tell in the more shadowed scenes, but they looked much akin to those deleted scenes on the special features where they didn't bother touching them up. Kinda disapointed and I may decide to buy a different copy somewhere in the close future. I was also expecting the slim case version.However they don't skip or stall out my DVD player so if you can deal with the couple of lower quality scenes here and there it's a fair to good product."
3,good dvd but missing scenes on lie to me and dialog,good dvd but missing scenes on lie to me and dialog in lie to me
3,Buffy Rocks,"I loved this boxed set, but felt there was much more they could have added in regards to special features. So far none of the Buffy boxed sets have had any cast interviews except the 6th season, which was only a Academy of Arts and Sciences featurette. I wish they had more special features!"
4,Good season,The fight scenes were still chippy until towards the end of the season. Good drama and excellent stories to show to the audience.
3,"Good content, BAD image quality!","Hey, if you like Buffy, you'll like these episodes. (Like they say below) However, I was very frustrated to find that the image quality can be very poor at times. I tested it on both of my players, to make sure it was the DVD. Makes you wonder who fell asleep whild managing the transfer to DVD format. Grrrr..."
4,great 4 your collection... if there weren't any glitches,"Actually, if you are anything of a buffy fan then you wouldn't let a few glitches get in your way. The behind the scenes extras are uninspiring but the episodes remain amazing... and still some of my favourites. My only problem was with the sound... skips, roughness, and feeback were problems that I encountered, but never in the same place. And since my friend had the same problem when borrowing the collection from me, I can't claim computer problems. But if you are willing to take the chance, it is worth it."
4,One of the best seasons,"I really enjoyed Season 2 of Buffy. There were a few ""skip"" episodes, but all in all I thought it was very entertaining. I am a huge fan of Angel and am looking forward to Season 3. I recommend this DVD for any Buffy fan....especially if you have a computer to access the additional ""extras""!!"
4,Fan of the Buffster,Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Second Season (Slim Set)I am so glad I found this series for sale cause I never really had time to watch it when it came out and I didn't get to see what happened to buffy in the end.Now I don't have to wait for the a T.V or cable station to air the old re-runs of Buffy because I plan to own every season so I can watch my favorite episodes when ever I want!
5,season 2 rocks!,"spike is introduced... that should be a clue for how great season 2 is. and the interaction between the core trio of friends is established even further. also, buffy starts fighting more ... ... all in all, i love season 2!"
4,Show is great..DVD itself not so great..,"A *MUST-HAVE* for any Buffy fan! It includes all the great episodes from Season 2. Season 2 introduces Spike into the series, which adds action and excitment. Also focuses on the relationship of Angel and Buffy, which is a rollercoaster ride to say the least.However, the DVD packaging/quality falls way short. When I first purchased the product, I ended up with TWO disk 2s and no Disk 1, which resulted in me having to return it and getting another. The picture quality is up and down, which can drive you nuts. One minute the picture will suffer from ""salt and pepper"" effects, yet in another scene the picture will be perfect. Which is much like Season 1 DVD Collection did. This should NOT turn you away from buying this DVD, as I said the show is great itself, unfortunately the DVD isn't so great."
4,"Good clarity and normal ""clean"" ears","I own this headset and use it regularly with my V60 phone while I'm driving. The clip I have does move up and down the cord easily and I'm able to adjust it just fine. The ear piece fits well in my ear and its exceptionally clear. (Better than actually holding the phone). People on the other end hear me well, despite the fact the mic dangles away from my lips. The button on the mic lets me start a call, from the received calls menu, very useful when I'm driving."
1,Look for somethign else!,It looks great and the price is good but if you cannot hear the call then what is the point?
3,Probably better for horn...,"These exercises will definitely improve technique on trumpet, but in my opinion, they're better-suited for horn."
5,Great product and easy to use.,It is a great product at a fair price. Amazon has the best price for it.
3,Pricey,"It is correct part just too pricey and a nuisance. No more buying razors from Wal-Mart or Target if they make me do this.This is the 4th one of these I bought. These are cheap knock-offs. They fall out of the razor when being used. Some of them come not even flush cross-wise. Some are not aligned, 1 side is flush other side is pushed in 1-3 mm. Ouch!"
3,Works good but has some annoyances.,"Within the first 2 weeks of owning the shaver, I had to replace the foil. This is because the head falls off if you're not careful and can damage the foil. When it works, it works good (much better and closer shave than clippers), just don't let the head fall off and damage the foil."
2,Not worth the effort,"Over priced, poor quality loose fitting. This product is not the same specs as the original. Dead fit loosely and frequently fell out of the handle. I purchased a whole new trimmer for only $12. Don't buy these replacements."
3,Not as great as the original,"When I first bought the philips norelco bodygroom I was ecstatic at how easy it was to use, then the shaver foil broke. I purchased a new one reading reviews that it's even better than the original. I installed it and tried to trim my body hair. I would have to disagree that it was doing a better job than the original foil. It works, but it takes twice as long now as it used to with the original foil. It may just be my hair because it's really course, but the shaver worked fine before I replaced the shaver foil. It's gotten to a point that I rarely use it at all now. Just FYI, this is shaving with a guard on. It works great without a guard on, but not everyone likes to go ""bald""."
3,Great product but...,"Works so fine, but is kind of expensive if you take in count that it would die within 3 months using it once a week."
3,"fits, but VERY sharp..grabs at my hair like a weedwacker","Maybe cause it's new....has to be broken in. Was grooming my chest, arm's and leg's and this new cartridge was really pulling on my hair.....it was painful. I always thought the sharper the blade, the less tugging and pulling you get......so what's the deal ? This is a brand new replacement cartridge."
5,Philips Foil,I was happy to find a replacement since it's not found in stores in North Carolina. I loved that I received it quickly.
3,"Good, not great.","The problem I had before, which is what prompted me to purchase the replacement foil, was that when I use the Bodygroomer on certain parts of the body it tended to snag and the foil would fall off. I attributed this problem as wear and tear on the foil, but after just buying the new foil the problem still persists. This can be very aggrivating, especially if you shave over the toilet! Granted, I realize that I may be pressing down too hard on my skin with the Groomer, yet I still rate the Bodygroomer good, just not great - which is what their website indicates."
3,Not very good,Not what I expected. Very difficult item to rate. It is not smooth and can iritate skin. Maybe i need to replace the main razor
2,"Basic Joint Locks, Little of Value","This is a book about some VERY basic jointlocks and some other ""bunkai,"" or applications, found in some specific japanese kata. Little to no value for anyone with any experience, and little to no content on what are commonly considred pressure point or vital point strikes (i.e. blood vessels, nerve plexes, cavity presses.) A good primer for beginning japanese stylists on the value and methods of dissecting kata... little more than this. Also, photos and diagrams were very poor and of little help."
2,not as good as it should be for the $$$,I have to say that I was excited when I saw this unit for the v60. Now I wish I spent the [money] to get a personal Walkman. It gets tangled instantly and it is too heavy if you are going to jog with it. The volume can barely be heard if anything else is going on. I use it in the gym for cardio work. It is ok on a stair stepper but awful for treadmill where you are bouncing and moving around.The idea is good and it is easy to use. It was just too expensive for how little it helped.
5,Love it!,"I use and love both Tone Up On Broadway and Broadway Sweat. Broadway Sweat is great because you can moderate how intense you want your workout -- sometimes I do it ""low impact"" and other times ""high impact."" I also enjoy the toning with the cords. My only criticism is that it took me two or three weeks before I fully mastered the steps (there's not much instruction on that, Richard and the people on the tape just do the dances and expect you to follow). I also love the broadway show tunes! I always love Richard Simmons videos because there are people of all shapes, sizes, and genders doing the workouts."
3,The Last Afront,"Too bad this final set of DVDs does not include all of the original music. ""Our Town"" is still there, but none of the other music is, like ""Forever Night Shde Mary"" by the Latin Playboys. Pretty dissapointing, but I still bought it. :("
3,Missing Episodes on Disc 2,"Has anyone else discovered a problem with this final NE season (Season Six) disc set? Not just missing music, etc. Episode 8. ""Up River"" and Episode 9 ""Sons of the Tundra"" are completley missing from my Disc 2 of this set. The two most pivitol episodes of the season are NOT HERE. The episode contents (index) on Disc 2 only lists three episodes; ""The Robe,"" ""Zarya"" and ""Full Upright Position"" (episodes 5, 6 and 7). This makes an already short season at 23 episodes only 21 episodes on my Sixth (final) Season set. Did anyone else get stiffed like this?"
5,Okay,"This item provides the same amount of information that you can find on the internet for free! If your school requires this book for any course, pass it up. You can find all of this information and more on quite a few different academic sites."
4,Convenient size but limited information,"This guide covers most of the APA basics, but I found one place where it differs from the APA Publication Manual. A period in an intext reference was misplaced. My professor caught the mistake when I followed this guide's placement. It is, however, very handy and fits in a brief case nicely so I use it often."
4,It's only like a brochure,"Pocket Guide to Apa Style is just like a brochure. It's not enough for writing your paper, thesis or dissertation. However, it's so small that it's convenient for you to carry. If you want a complete APA concept, you need to buy ""Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association."""
5,A treasure trove of ideas,I love this book and consider it an essential one to own. I don't stick to only what is within it's pages- I use it to also spark my own creativity around the drumset. I work from it daily.
3,for drummers in a marching band..,"This book is mostly exercises for only one drum at a time. This is a good book if you are in a marching band and it appears to be skewed for that. Not a good book for practicing coodination of all the different parts, which is what I needed. The author talks a LOT about practice pads, which many drummers do not use, yet he speaks of them as if everyone does."
4,"Felt the burn, but difficult to keep motivated","I didn't expect this video to be well, so...""old-school"". The whole feel of the video is so 80's/early 90's, and I found the music to be terrible. I do however believe that the workout itself is pretty good...I definately could feel the burn. I'm not sure if it motivates me enough to stick with it for the long-run."
3,Overall Satisfied,"I'm a very ""frugal"" person and always look for a bargain...I believe these are a deal for the price. They were very soft before the first wash and after did seem to be a tiny bit rougher, but that was sovled with adding a little extra fabric softner in the next wash. I found there to be very little, if any difference in these sheets and some I could have purchased at a local department store for three times the price. If you need good quality king size sheets at an affordable price...buy these!"
3,"Starts off great, slows down","Yeah so how can an album start off so good with ""To Be Young"" then go into ""My winding Wheel"" and ""AMY"" great songs than just slowly turn into crappy, boring Ben Harper sounding gospel rock?The album turns around shortly before the end with ""SHakedown on 9th Street"" but than continues with boring bad songs. I'm willing to give Mr. Adams another try just as long as he picks up the slack."
4,Some really wonderful songs.,"This album can be pretty laid back at times, but there is some great songwriting going on here. My favorite is AMY. This song is beautiful all the way through and it contains about five different melodic sections that blend together seamlessly. To Be Young, My Winding Wheel, Damn,Sam, Call Me On Your Way Back Home, and Come Pick Me Up are all excellent. Definetly one of the best of the year. This guy has got the goods."
5,personal favorite album of all time,"This album has grown to be my favorite album in my collection. I own this both on CD and Vinyl and it is in rotation at least twice a week since the first time I made the purchase. Heartbreaker comes off as the most honest and organic sounding album I have listened to. In many ways it reminds me alot of the feeling you can get from a Dylan ""Blood on the tracks/ Blonde on Blonde"" listen but with a modern touch. Its a genuine Record that hopefully becomes a classic."
1,He's no Hick'ry Hawkins,"This CD is nowhere near The Hell I am by Hick'ry Hawkins. If you wnat true alt country, listen to Hick'ry. This guy is just a sellout."
1,When did cry-baby sob music become popular?,As if Jeff Tweedy and EMO music weren't bad enough for the music industry. I'd rather have my toes plucked off with bolt cutters than have to listen to this album again.
2,Dully disguising derivative,"Yes, there is usually an air of disingenuous sincerity present in Adams' aesthetic pursuits of gritty country-rock, but that does not take away from his unique pop songwriting talents to help raise the songs higher. In fact, it is when Adams completely abandons any preconceived notions of ""authenticity"" and simply follows the melody with conviction that he often records his best work. With Heartbreaker, the overworking artist is nearly in full-on Dylan acoustic mode though, mainly drawing generically unimpressive results, with truly memorable passages such as the chorus of ""Come Pick Me Up"" being a rarity."
2,Unoriginal And Uninteresting,"Although I doubt they meant their name to be ironic, the corrosion of conformity seems to have mostly affected the band. They are, after all, just like any other loud `angry' metal band. To put it another way, they are annoying, bland, crowd following poseurs. A bit like a watered down Cannibal Corpse, but not as funny. Who cares?"
2,NOT Pepper...,"It's okay, but not nearly as good as any of the Pepper Keenan sung albums...which means I listened to this album once and put it on a back shelf somewhere. If you want to listen to the GREAT, heavy, COC albums, check out ""Deliverance"", ""Wiseblood"", and ""In the Arms of God""...those are elite heavy metal albums. ""America's Volume Dealer"", another Keenan lead album is pretty darn good, too."
3,lowered expectations,"I first reead TRY which I thought is a great and amazing book so I got FRISK. I wasn't too hot about the first part of the book, then it got better with dennis weirding out but when it got into totally gruesome violence it made me feel like i don't like it because of the same reason i wouldn't like a splattermovie where you feel it's just shock without too much of a story, humor or anything worthwhile. shame as i liked the story of dennis becoming obsesed with killing boys. loved TRY not so much this one."
3,Fair.... lacking in depth,This book coupled with the online documentation and the Proxy Trancender .... was worth it. It would be nice for them to revise this book and include more relevant test material. About 80% of the questions can be answered by reading the online doc's.
2,Read these reviews carefully before you buy this book!,"Based on the less than stellar reviews of this book, I supplemented the reading with a number of braindumps, and discovered that maybe 5% of the questions on the exam are covered in the Exam Cram book. I was relieved to still be able to pass the test, but you can get better information for free off the braindump sites than you can buying this study guide. If you must get this book, borrow it or buy it used. You don't need it, though!"
4,Excellent book if used after IIS4 and TCP/IP tests,"I had taken the IIS4 and TCP/IP tests prior to Proxy, which relies on these two areas. I used this Exam Cram and the Proxy Transcender to pass the exam. No surpises on the test with this preparation."
4,Great follow up to his first Christmas album,This is Neil's 1994 follow up to his 1992 Christmas album. Neil's voice is in top form on the 15 songs he performs on this CD. Some of my favorites are:Joy To The WorldMary's Boy ChildWinter WonderlandCandlelight CarolAway in a MangerThe First NoelHark The Herald Angels SingHallelulah ChorusI had never heard Candlelight Carol before. Neil sings it beautifully. Overall a nice selection of holiday tunes.
5,One of his best...,"The song ""Have a little faith"" is so inspiring to me and it means holding on and keep kicking."
3,ok,basically its just a stuff animal with arm straps because the interior portion of the item has no storage value whatsoever.
3,A missed-opportunity!,"Not very scary stories, kinda sluggish writing. I do not reccomend this if you like true horror...but if you like slighter, subtle scariness, it's o.k."
1,Why was this thing published,I gave up in somewhat less than a hundred pages. I should have quit reading sooner but it had a sort of grim fascination like a train wreck. You keep thinking that it could not possibly get any worse only to be repeatedly proven wrong. The previous reviews tell why. Only a right wing nut would be willing to put up with the wretched thing.
1,A Clunky Read,"Baen's offerings these days are bit like the curate's egg. And I'm sorry to say that A State of Disobedience is not amongst the good parts. This MilSF novel is a vehicle for a slew of reactionary kneejerks, centered on a less than two-dimensional rabid lesbian Hillary Clinton knockoff and her cabal of homosexuals pollutin the Murrican bodily fluids, or whatever, a unimaginative reenactment of Waco and the usual blood'n'guts battle scenes. Now that would be ok for the usual airport page turner. The clunky prose, the execrable dialog and the all too transparent desire to get back at ""Hillary, Janet and Lon"" make this book a case for a speedy trip to the used book store. I'll rather take my political propaganda neat, thanks."
5,Fantastic Technical Writing Textbook!,All of my students have enjoyed learning the fine art of technical writing using this textbook. The book is extremely well-written and easy to understand. Nicely organized. Informative and interesting. The perfect choice for any teacher or student!
2,Not the best,I was very disappointed in this tape. It's not very demanding and there's so much chatter you get to the point you'd rather turn the sound off then listen one more time. That's Leslie's biggest problem. She talks too much and forgets that these tapes will be used more than one or two times. There are better tapes out there and Leslie has a few.
5,very quiet compared to the competition,this is a great pump. handles all three features in our 20 gallon tank without any problems. it's also very quiet. inlike the competitio's pump that has 'quiet' in the name.
5,Well Done,"This is one of the few films I've bought for myself. Usually I purchase gifts for my family and friends, but when I was looking around the other day I found this one and thought that I would pick it up. I'm glad I did.The DVD is full of many different types of films about racism in the 20th Century. My favorite one is the one that compares the way we treated African Americans in the 1950s with facism during World War II.The other clips make me realize that racism was much worse when my parents were growing up than they are today, but it makes me think about how we treat each other still."
5,Really Good,When I saw the color purple play and her Elisabeth Withers sing I could not wait to get her CD. I really enjoy her music and can't for her to put out another.To me she did a great job and she is going to go far in her career.
2,Take a Second Look,"I was pleased with the size of the system, but the speakers could be a little bit better (the sound was slightly tinny). i substituted a better quality pair of aiwa speakers already in my possession, and got better performance. remote control was missing from the box."
3,Poor shipping package from Amazon,"The body oil leaks into the package everywhere with other ordered items since the cap of the bottle is open. Only half bottle left plus all the mess! Why don't Amazon use proper protection for the bottle and seal up properly? As for the oil, it has a rich smell and feels good on skin."
3,Hmmmm....,"I'm a lotion girl. I bought this product based on the reviews here, so I don't really have any other body oils to compare it with. But this product could be better if it was more of a body oil spray because a light squeeze brings you a lot of oil on your palm. Too much oil. You only need a little bit to go along way.I like the lightness of sesame oil from Neutrogena. But I wanted to get an alternate organic product. I'm not sure I made the right decision. The oil is a little too thick for me. The smell also reminds me of some sort of Hawaiian tropic oil (suntan lotion). I prefer a lighter and cleaner scent. But do I hate it? No. It's just okay for me."
4,Body Oil Fan,"I have ordered this body oil several times already and will continue to do so. It is great for making your skin soft and gives it a light shimmer for night time. It smells really good and several people who have smelled it on me have said the same thing to me. My only complaint is that the way the bottle is made to dispense the oil (small hole in the middle under a snap on cap) tends to leak a little bit. When you tip it back, excess oil slides down the sides of the bottle and puddles around the bottom of the bottle so I keep it wrapped in the plastic that it arrives in to catch the oil."
2,Misleading --Not really Kukui oil,"This is not Kukui oil. this is an oil blend with a little kukui oil added. Read the label.That being said, it's a nice oil. But the labeling is definately misleading."
1,totally not kmk's best,"i read on kmk's website that this was going to be their BEST album yet... so i was pretty pumped for it to come, but i was totally dissappointed once i listened. they seem to have completely changes their sound. i miss the old kmk like ""high society"" and even ""hidden stash 2"". it sounds to me like their are trying too hard to be ghetto fabulous. what happened to singing about livin in the suburbs and smokin out witcha friends? remember, your p-town ballers, not gangsta gangsta."
3,"Decent, but There's no Accounting for Taste....","No one on this planet loves the fine prose of Nathan M. Bisk quite like I do. His flourishing adjectives, singing adverbs, and dancing prepositions dazzle me with each new work. With this latest tome, however, I feel The Artist has slipped a smidgon. Not to say that he ranks any lower than say, Faulkner, Hemingway, or Heche. He's still a master craftsman of words, but for some reason the CPA Comprehensive Exam Review, 2003 doesn;t have the same crackle of the 2002 or the wit and jib of the 2001 masterpiece."
2,Makita wet polisher water hook up problem,There should be a ready to hook up system for the water. I had go order additional equipment in order to use the poliher. Otherwise It is a great product.
4,Really tough,"I first started this workout after having my 2nd son. It is really tough!I like the excercises,and after a few months of doing it was able to get through the whole tape. The tough tape 2 is nice because it covers everything. The standing legs is a killer!I had results with in a couple weeks. Everything was firmer like the name ""the firm"", but I am very slow to loose any weight. Overall it's good for firming up, but not for weightloss."
5,DVD,"Kids love these DVDs. Good quality, fast shipping and great price. This is watched everyday by my grandson while he plays with his trucks."
4,Simple Pleasures,"Pleasure Sensitive is the second offereing from Tony Whitfield. The CD offers ten well produced tracks with apperacnces by Hiram Bulluck on Guitar & Onaje Allan Gumbs on keyboards. Cedric Napolean lends his vocal stylings to the mix as well on the track ""Baby Come Home."" The title track is kind of gruf but remains smooth at the same time. ""Visions of your Smile"" is another track that stands out on the CD, the only problem is that it's play length is to short at just 2:34. Mr. Whitfield pays homage to his friend and Mentor Al Jarreau on the track ""Jarreau's Journey."" The track is mellow khoul & sets the mind at ease. My favorite track on the CD is ""East Coast Swing"" it's just busy, there is a lot going on in that one track. Credit goes to Mr. Whitfield for making that track work. All in all, the cd is khoul, definitely something to add to the collection.peace & la dre'"
5,Tony Bennet has captured the essense of the Holiday season!,"The ""Snowfall"" CD is one of the best Christmas albums I have heard. In line with Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Andy Williams, this is certainly worth adding to your Christmas selection!!! Tony Bennet is my new favorite Christmas artist."
3,Just OK.,"Maybe for a die-hard Tony fan this is a real gem, but for me... it just is a bit to 'tremolo'. Easy on the vibrato Tony, you're making me dizzy.Orchestrations are just OK, as are the arrangements. Recording and mastering is uneven and even a bit nasty at times.Get ""Ella wishes you a swinging Christmas"" instead. You'll be very glad you did. It is the best (jazz-vocal) Christmas album I own."
4,"Not as good as Fate, but...","When Tony left Mercyful Fate I was shocked. Is his solo-album going to be even half as good as Fate-recordings, I wondered. Well, no problem: This is great one (and fortunately Tony hasn't done nu-metal), maybe because this sounds similar to Mercyful Fate; mixing black metal, horror-rock (lyrics) and tuneful melodies Tony has done one of the heaviest albums of the year. But of course this is not as good as albums of his earlier band (solo recordings rarely are). By the way, look at the cover of the album: Doesn't Tony look scary??"
1,Personalization,"I ordered this as a Xmas present and there was no place to put in your personalization. So we are sending it back. Disappointed. The directions on this page make no sense. Maybe its just me, but they should really make their directions for personalization easier."
3,"There are no shortcuts, it's all practice!","I bought this book and 2 others ""The Secret of Amusement Park Games Revealed"" and ""How To Win at Carnival Games"" because I was curious to see what was in them. They ALL give you some general idea of how to go about winning some of the games but in essence, it takes lots of practice and perhaps building your own version of it at home. Let's face it, the carnies make their living from people walking up who think that they can win. The odds are on their side and as long as you believe that ""it's just a lot of fun to try"", you're on the right track. You can and will spend a lot of money chasing those large stuffed animals if you think these books will make you win. That's my 2 cents. :-)"
4,A Great Movie Okay Songs Bad Basketball,"My class did one of the songs from this movie for an ""end of school"" concert. We did We're All In This Together. I thought most of these songs were pretty corny apart from WAITT and Breakin' Free. I didn't like that you had to wait until the end of the movie to get two great songs. I was embarrassed as a basketball player when I saw ""Getcha' Head In The Game"" Zac Efron looks nothing like a basketball player. I thought this had some VERY corny songs, but had a couple jewels at the end to make you want to come back and see it again. I thought Vanessa Anne Hudgens and Lucas Graabel acted very well. Zac was so so. He could've done better. I have seen the second HSM, and liked the singing a lot better. I liked the plot too. I would CAUTION ANYONE THINKING ABOUT BUYING IT: RENT IT FIRST BEFORE BUYING IT. Watch HSM 2 as well. Overall: 2 was better, but for 13 bucks, buy it."
5,Wonderful Movie!!!,"I am a 28 year mom of a 5 year old and what really got me excited about watching the movie was the video ""Get Cha Head in the Game"". That song is mine and my daughter's favorite song. I was really impressed with the movie and felt that it is for audiences of all ages. I recorded the sing-a-long and the dance-a-long as well. I haven't gotten the dance steps down yet but I'm working on it :) I cannot wait until the movie comes out on DVD. I am definitely going to buy it. For those who haven't seen this movie really need to check it out. I even had my mom who is 49 watching the movie and she loved it as well."
1,This movie SUCKS!,There are only 2 groups of people who have an excuse for liking this movie.1. 7-10 year old girlsand2. RETARDSAnyone else should know what a piece of unrealistic crap this is! They don't bother to tell the little kids that their high school years will be a living Hell! At least I know mine were anyway!
2,Great except for Vanessa Hudgens...,"Why does Vanessa Hudgens (Gabriella) always smile when she's acting, like she's uncomfortable? Reminds me of Bush giving his speeches. Everyone else is great, especially Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale), but Vanessa Hudgens destroys most of the movie with her weak vocals and even weaker acting.They should've cast Vanessa as the girl who stayed home with mononucleosis while a better acress was cast as Gabriella."
5,Presant,I bought this for my daughter's birthday. She really likes it. It's a cute movie. It's a good musical based more for teenagers.
2,not that great....,"personally, I don't know what it is everyone sees in this movie. To me it's just a cheesy storyline with an obviouse ending. Nuff said.Now, there were some good singers but others were awful in my opinion. Whtas her face (I forget) The girl who plays in zack and Cody has a horrible voice.To me, the songs get really annoying afterwhile. Especially when everyone in your clas is singing it. Yeah, imagine haveing everyone singing ""were soaring flying.."" all the time in your school. (especially when they sing really bad too) yeah, you get my point.It was not all bad. This just wasn't a movie for me. Personally I think Disney Channel movies suck. This one wasn't that bad, but I just didn't like it."
2,So-so,"There were some aspects of the movie that were good, and some not. The actors are great, and the singing as well, but that seems to be the only important thing. The plot was pretty simplistic, the message was unoriginal, and the gags barely registered as funny. Do not expect to feel changed after leaving the cinema."
5,fun,I had to watch it because my brothers friend (corbin) was in it. I was soooo excited for him now he has a couple movies under his belt and is in two tv shows at the moment. GO CORBIN!!!
4,Kids Delight in the Story and the Bonus Features are Fun,"The recent phenomenon surrounding the popularity of ""High School Musical"" is no surprise to anyone with children between five and sixteen. This DVD is well done. The ""sing-along"" version of the film is a great feature. Kids have an opportunity to really participate in the story and it has potential to be a party favorite. Other great features include a behind-the-scenes look at how the film was made and interviews with the cast. There is also a feature that teaches some of the dances. Again, a favorite for children, and fun for the parents too."
5,Why so high price?,This movie was a favorite of my daughter. I would have ordered it here but its twice the price here that it is everywhere else.
4,Grease for the 21st Century!,"I'm sure I'm not the only person who has ever said this, but this movie is basically Grease set in the modern era. Troy, the big sports star, loves singing musicals with Gabriella, but his friends and father think that this is taking his head out of the game. They want him to stop singing and to stop being with the girl.But Troy is a good guy and thinks he can do both! The movie is all about encouraging the people in your life to follow their dreams. Be a blessing, not a burden!Also, the movie music is BETTER than Grease! Great stuff!"
1,why would anyone in there right ind like this!,"THIS IS IN NO WAY EVEN CLOSE TO A REAL DEPICTION OF HIGH SCHOOL! This may be one of the worst movies/telivison movies I have ever seen, heard, and I had to throw up because of it. In a real high school its never at any givin time all happy, joy, joy, like in this pitiful excuse for a movie. WHY ARE THEY SINGING!!! They have 10 times more important things to do like, getting ready for college, getting a girlfriend/boyfriend, or atleast any friends at all! None of the cast in this movie could do any of that IMPORTANT STUFF! Instead they think they can just sing there problems away. YEAH, RIGHT! Singing doesnt get you into college people! But I digress, please save yourself from this horrible move and spare your social life."
3,Not One Of Her Best,"This is a story about a young woman who has fallen prey to Thomas Capano, The Deadly Seducer. Like a lot of young women with low self esteem, she slowly believes that he is the only person who will ever love someone like her because of her many faults. Slowly, with the helps of therapists, she finds confidence and love. Thomas Capano cannot stand this. He wants all his women to need him and do what he wants and if he can't have them, no one will.The story behind this book is very common but it just seemed to drag on for a long time. I really enjoy reading Ann Rule but I found myself scanning pages because there was a lot of unnecessary info. It's a good read nonetheless."
5,Ann Rule's Thomas Capano: The Deadly Seducer...And Never Let Her Go,"I, wanted to read the book to see if there were additions to the DVD version. Very Intersting Reading.Enjoy!"
4,Good book,I enjoyed this book. It's much better than Above the Law & not quite as good as Fatal Embrace.
2,Very disappointed in this book!,"Ann, what happened? You are my favorite true crime author but this book doesn't have ""it"" Reminds me of 5 or 6 stories all crammed into one book. But I'll be waiting for your next book!!"
2,If You Didn't Know Any Better It Almost Sounds True,"The Ann Rule book was well written. I was surprised that it seemed to be a Debby MacIntyre biography. The attempt to make Ms MacIntyre come out smelling like a rose was laughable. The fact that Debby was portrayed as a victim was a joke. For someone who knows nothing about the case it seems almost reasonable. I would take this book at face value and say it was good. If I were interested in the truth I would be concerned with the factual errors printed and wonder why more research didn't go into it before it hit the shelves. Also, I thought it was a low blow to the Capano children that the author would say catty remarks about their style of dress. I think if Ms Rule would have attended more than a handful of days at the trial the book would have had a different slant."
2,The editor should have never let this book off his desk,"Well-written? This is one of the worst written books I've read in decades.I slogged through this mire of words and redundant, ill-phrased pop psychology until page 103, when I nearly stopped reading altogether after I read this sentence, written in the author's own words and not a quote from anyone. ""They agreed to keep seeing each other, and her world seemed temporarily brighter, although she felt sorry for him because he told her he had to go to some stupid law seminar that he dreaded."" SOME STUPID LAW SEMINAR? Yes, the whole book, while based on a very interesting story fleshed out with some rich detail,is filled with shockingly bad prose of that sort. Who writes like that? Ann Rule has an excuse: She's a professional cop. Who lets that kind of sentence and this kind of book get printed? The editor and publisher ought to be ashamed of themselves."
1,what video,"Tried to order on line twice found it very confusing, didn't order video. Tried to get out of program without ordering, apprently that didn't work also. Would love to have the movie but if I did order it on 7/29/2012 it still has not arrivied as of 08/29/2012.Later Dinkydow"
1,Snoozefest,This is low grade 1960s-70s calibre TV style acting.......Connery as an Arab isn't convicing for even a second....The landscape camera work is breathtaking at times.....This is cornier than the worst of John Wayne films......It had to of cost a lot of money to make this hunk of crap.......This is a bland movie...Bergen is stale too.
3,Only because of Connery,"I really like Sean Connery, but this movie is strange with him as an Middle Easterner. He did not even try to disguise his accent :)It was fun, though, especially the scenery."
5,The Wind and the Lion,"One of the overlooked action/adventure movies. Good cast, with a scenic backdrop of the Arabian desert. Good story line that shifts between America and Arabia. Sean Connery and Brian Keith play two men of strength and character leading their respective peoples. All in all a fun movie to sit and enjoy!"
2,Tedious read,"I wavered between a two and a three for this one. At best it's a run-of-the-mill beauty and the beast story that's entertains but brings nothing new to the table. At worst, it's a poorly written story that overuses POV prose, tells instead of shows and rehashes the fairly exasperating ""angsty disabled/scarred hero consumed by self-loathing redeemed by endlessly patient and good Mary Sue heroine."" The good characters are unconflicted and perfect while the bad characters are pure malice and outrageously cruel. This can work in a melodrama, but the author seemed to want to play them straight, and so they're just soulless and cardboard. I read it in one sitting, but it never swept me away and Noah's self-pity was just wearying."
4,Smokin' pot!,"I've had this teapot for about a year now. It has performed very well. No chipping, and is easy to pour & clean. Great addition to the kitchen."
5,White man can rap,this album is the one of my favorited LPs ever...Green made it with the famous Black Eyed Peas
1,THIS GUY CAN'T RAP,"he is no slim shady and Vanilla Ice sounds better. Sign with No Limit then will talk, but stick to 90210 and do us all a favor."
2,Adult Development and Aging,I was told it was in good shape. It was not. The cover page came apart early; the binding came apart shortly after. It was not in good shape!
2,Not my favorite book,"This text provided very basic information on development and aging. The authors site their work several times throughout, but left out several other studies that should have been included. It may be good for undergrad level, but definitely not enough detail for grad students."
4,Great replacement,It was a perfect fit and worked great for about 4 months then the connector at the phone end fell apart. Will buy another as it is very very reasonably priced.
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRDOCT,"This case is horrible. My biggest problem is that every time you open the phone, the mic moves behind the plastic window. The plastic that covers the screen is pointless. If you get gunk on it just take the two seconds and wipe it on your pant leg. Tada! It's clean. The plastic also makes it harder to use the keys. I have small hands so the V60 is perfect for me. However, this case makes it a hassle for the smallest hands so I can only imagine the trouble someone with average hands would have. STAY WAY. Use the plastic holster, it's easy and simple."
1,LeatherCase for V60G is useless,The leather case is not well made for a Expensive phone like V60G. I am returning it back to Amazon. The case is as hard as if it is made of cardboard. Mine was bend at one point when i got it. Also the mouthsize side of the phone doesnot go in fully and I tried to sqeeze in the lower side of phone to the point i was afraid it will break the phone. And also the mouth peice of the phone gets covered by the plastic as it doesnot fit in and affects the quality of speech. I am returning it asap to amazon.
2,Very poor OEM case,Purchased the V60t and ordered the case because Amazon.com did not have anything else(i.e.Body Glove). Motorola put very little thought into this case for such a great phone. Offers some protection but not for the front Caller I.D. screen area. The belt clip drops the rating on this case. Nothing beats the swivel clip for easy removal and the design ruins the look of the phone. Did find a cellular dealer here in Nassau that had both Body Glove and sb wireless... cases that are much better and more attractive. If you cannot find any other case to protect your phone this will do but be prepared for a fight with the belt clip when you get a call.
1,Could do better,"The v60 is a great phone. I wish someone could come up with a better idea for something to carry it in. This is my third try at different cases. The original that came with the phone offers no protection and is hard to get the phone on and off. This case you have to take the whole case off your belt to answer the phone, which is difficult with the u clip on the bottom of the spring loaded belt clip. Come on guys!!!!!! Someone has to have a better idea for a case for this great phone. Whats wrong with the old star tac type style????? My advise is not to waste your money on this case."
1,You will be sorry if you buy this product,"...[This] product ... does not fit the phone correctly, and the clip is poorly built; mine hit the floor 4 times in a two week period, causing damage to the body and antennae. I am returning the product; [this is] a very poor OEM accessory."
2,Disappointing,I purchased this after watching Doc Martin series.I guess I was spoiled as i found very little humor in this show. I would suggest people watch all of Martin Clunes shows before viewing Doc Martin. Prbably more humor will be found that way.
4,reggir rate,The videos are typical British humor with some course words and sexual innuendo. Fairly ridiculous ideas piled on top of eachother.
3,"dark, darker, lights out","Steve Lawler has recently made a name for himself with his tribal vibe and clever drum mechanics. This is an interesting compilation of beats that bring us into the deep blackness of night. I like my dance music on the lighter side and so I give it only 3 stars as I find a lot of the tribal stuff out there just to repetative and the lack of melody leaves me wanting more. On the other hand, this album really stands out when compared to Bedrock's John K and Stephane Creamer -- a total dud. When I listen to Chris Fortier's or Jimmy Van M's Bedrock compilation I like these much, much better. Still if you ar into Lawler, I think this is a must have. If you like Sasha, Dave Seaman, Hernan Cattaneo, Sander Kleinenberg or Tiesto, this will probably bring only dissapointment. That being said, I think this is what the tribal guru Danny Tenaglia should be moving toward. Hope this helps. rock the vote ;}"
4,Tough workout!,"Another of Firm's compilation tapes, this one has 45 minutes of toning toning toning. Unlike other Firm workouts, there are no cardio sections, which I missed, since I use them to recover from the tough strength work. That said, my heartrate was definitely in the target zone through about 30 minutes of this tape.For intensity, this one is an intermediate/advanced tape, on par with Firm Strength or Firm Cardio, I think just below Total Body or Body Sculpting Basics. The compilation flows nicely, and all your major muscles get a great workout, except for the abs. I find myself adding a set from 5-Day Abs at the end and 10 minutes from some other cardio tape somewhere in the middle to round things out."
1,unexpected,"Wishing to hear more of Billy Strayhorn's music, especially Lush Life number, I was disappointed that a soloist obscured the tonal chord nuances . Maybe I did not read carefully the pr before ordering. So beware."
2,Disappointed!,I bought this for my pup because he likes to watch other dogs on tv. Unfortunately... there is just a narrator the whole time and the puppies don't make any noise! No barking or playing noises at all so he quickly lost interest. I wish it had said it was narrated the whole way through!
2,Changes routines too fast,"I've done a lot of dancing, but Richard changes the routines very quickly with very little explanation. This video is confusing and would not be good for your knees if you're doing it on a carpeting living room because there's a lot of twisting. I gave it away after only going half way through it. However, for an excellent strength training video, try his Blast and Tone! It's extremely well done. Good routine, very well explained, appropriate cautions/reforcements suggested. I look forward to using every other day. And, it's working!"
3,Artscape,"A light and fun read, but the first couple of chapters dont get that across. I am glad I muddled through them to meet and appreciate the main character, Ike! A man from a small town became a man of the world (employed by the CIA) then returned to his small hometown to be elected sheriff. He selectively used his experience to solve a robbery/kidnapping, and witnessed the killing end to one of his heartbreaking losses. This just might be the first novel I've read wherein the CIA and Russia's equivalent were involved and I only had to remember one Russian name....no nickname or military rank...always confusing. Oh, and yes, he does ""get the girl!"""
4,Artscape,Great book! Very good read with a fantastic ending. Kept my interest completely through the book. Look forward to more books from this author!
5,No school like old school on Mac!,"This works flawlessly on the Apple platform, running Nestopia. Really provides that authentic Nintendo controller feel to game like Tecmo Super Bowl and Mega Man!"
3,Just the basics.,I found this video lacking in it's scope. It did cover the basics but did a poor job covering the many features of the GPS. It touched on some features but wasn't really an in depth tutorial.
2,Music is wonderful but sound is not,You can hardly miss by having a Stephane Grappelli DVD - so the music is lovelybut the quality of the recording is not good. Sounds very tinny and shallow intone.
4,A Good Companion,"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"
3,Green Lantern:Emerald Knights movie,"Unfortunetly, I was disapointed. I felt that we had been given better by DC Universe movies such as Batman Under the Red Hood or Superman Doomsday. I felt that some of the voice casting was off, as well. Kilowog should have had a stronger and deeper voice. Over all, the movie was ok, but it could have been much better."
1,AMATEURISH ANIMATION,"Just so prospective buyers know before they purchase this movie, the animation is extremely crude. It isn't what is called ""full animation"", such as the Disney classics are. It's a much cheaper type that I actually didn't know still existed. The old MARVEL superhero cartoons used this animation in the 1960s. So did Hannah-Barbera. Warner Brothers could and should have done much better. The animation ruins the credibility of the stories. It's just so much kiddie fodder. Terrible."
2,Money 2007,"Not much of an update from Money 2005, that I was using before. Great price at Amazon though."
1,Old wine in new bottle,"In short you can describe the software as ""old wine in new bottle"". There is absolutely no new feature except some good graphics that may please people who bought new LCD monitors rather than those who are serious about their money. How ironic that Microsoft expects you to spend money on a recycled software to manage money.I guess Microsoft thinks that if they increment their version number to the next year (just like US car manufacturers do), people may buy it thinking that they are ahead of the game. That's why they keep releasing new titles with the version number of next year though their software is year behind compared to other products.If you have Money 2003 or older, don't buy this package"
2,Extremely slow,"I have worked with earlier versions of Money, but 2007 is frustratingly slow, especially when using bills and matching bank items to bills. I am not sure that I will continue using it."
3,Too little weight work,"Firm videos are great for their weight work but this one falls short - great for the dancing, old-fashioned aerobics crowd but not for people who want weight work, the tall step and as little prancing around the living room as possible. If you're looking for good weight work, try the Strong Body and Cardio tapes. They include some geeky small step and dance parts but I just fast forward through them and go for a short run. Like several other Firm tapes I've purchased that strayed too far from their basic weight work, this one gets donated to the library."
5,The Ancient Alternative,"Gillquist opens for the reader the often neglected ""third door"" and introduces us to the Orthodox Church. A fascinating look at how so many evangelicals found the ancient Church of the first christians. This book will be a breath of fresh air for evangelicals who have taken ""sola scriptura"" to the limit and wondered what's next, and will encourage those who have researched Church history and cannot, in good conscience, accept Papal ecclesiology. At a time when the searching christian is seemingly confronted with the usual Roman/Protestant choices, Gillquist presents us with another option."
2,"Holds too tight, sticks out too far","This holster comes with the phone, I find it hard to believe that the same people that designed this wonderfull phone came up with this...The phone fits into the holster with a bunch of fiddling, you have to get the little grooves in the bottom of the phone lined up with the raised bits in the bottom of the holster. Takes me a couple of tries and works better if I can see what I'm doing.Once the top is snapped in, the holster holds onto the phone with a death grip. It feels like something will break trying to release it.To add insult to injury, the holster then holds the phone about an inch of my person. Why bother buying a tiny, thin phone just to have it stick out so far???There's got to be a better way."
3,V60 Holster Holds only Baby Battery,"Unlike previous StarTack Holsters, this one will not handle the V60 phone with the extra-length battery pack. I'm not sure if the leather holster can contain it either, and no review indicates this. How odd that after purchasing the latest Motorola phone, and upgrading to their top-of-the-line battery, you discover that this detail was overlooked by the M-people. Do they personally use the prototypes prior to releasing?"
1,Very Poor Design,The [person] who designed the Motorola V60's plastic holster should be fired. I fight with it to get the phone out - I fight with it to get the phone in. Bring back the StarTac!!
3,"Good,but not one of Horner's best","I am a huge fan of film music and James Horner is by far my favorite composer but even I must admit that this is not one of his better works.While the use of native american chants is very effective and enjoyable to listen to the album lacks what James Horner is best at:a theme.That said however,it is quite atmospheric and the relatively short running time makes it easy to listen to.Those seeking better Horner scores try Titanic,Apollo 13,Field Of Dreams,Glory and especially Legends Of The Fall."
5,best seller in native american culters,I feel this movie is the best that has ever been made in my opinion.It is very heart felt and is in very good detail.It really gives excellent details on how native americans go through things in life.The actors in this movie where excellent!I have recommended this movie to several people.Ive also seen the movie 30 or so times so far!The producers did a fantastic job making this movie and the choices for actors where stupendus!! Thank you. Tracy Shipley
1,Save your $$$ and buy a strobe light.,"Disappointing if you're hoping for more of the über coolness of ""Polydistortion"" and ""This Is Normal"".Wake me when it's over.Zzz..."
5,A movie to ghosts!,"Silvya died for years, but two people go into the crypt and find some water that brings dead, old and rotten things and people back to when the were alive or young. But if you smash its bottle, things and people become old and dead again and then the water is all gone. Rappicini's daughter discovered poision and evil flowers that makes the chemistry of your blood evil and Rappicini's father makes a amidote, which will cause to cure the evil chemistry in your blood, but it will kill you, too. Alice has a killer husband, who tried to kill her to death and in The House of Seven Gables, there is a ghost who keeps calling Alice and a witch in the haunted house tells her to get her husband out or else he'll die with blood on his lips! Then a skeleton hand chokes the evil husband to death, the The House of Seven Gables breaks down."
4,You can't get a better whacked video....,"A timeless video capturing the spirit of an era with an incessant voice that propels us forward, always thrusting us towards the goal of getting our buns in shape. Nothing spells *C*A*M*P* quite like Richard Simmons ""Sweatin' to the Oldies 3."" Well, maybe ""Love's BabySoft"" but that would be a different party. Great background video for debutante or other coming out soires. Be sure to make punch for everyone's refreshment afterwards. Jell-o shooters a must."
3,"From The Makers of ""Ink""","Fantastic-looking film, with surprisingly high production values for a low-budget first feature. The only failing is the script, which plays like a couple of high school kids' take on grown-up life, as seen by way of time travel and new-age mysticism. This makes a certain amount of sense, as it's a story about grown-up life by way of time travel and new-age mysticism, written by a couple of high school kids. It took them a few years to get the funding but the roots still show. Still, an entertaining film if you like this sort of thing, and a great primer on making a low-budget film - most especially if you're working out of town. This isn't nearly as good as their next film, Ink, but absolutely worth a look."
4,An Excellent Brushup of Vocabulary Skills,"I first used this book as a freshman in high school over 30 years ago. It provides excellent vocabulary drills, and enables the student to build up a sizeable vocabulary."
4,The way family life could and should be,"An excellent story of a ""pioneer"" family and how they lived in the latter part of the 19th century. Everything they needed to survive was provided for them by the resourcefulness of their father and mother. Mr. Ingalls was a very talented and energetic man and always made his family feel comfortable and protected. He was an excellent provider of food, water and shelter. Nothing ever discouraged him. If things didn't go the way he expected, he just found another way to get it done. He always found a way to turn adversity around. Mrs. Ingalls was a caring and loving mother who also was talented in the ways of housekeeping, cooking, sewing and creating a loving atmosphere in the home. The children were given responsibilities from a very early age and there were strict rules of discipline and manners that they were expected to adhere to. In the evening, the father would take out his fiddle and play songs for the family. It was a loving and happy home!"
4,Little House in the Big Woods,"I thought this book was a wonderful story. I love the wilderness and nature so this was a good book for me. I enjoyed reading about the stories that Pa tells. Like the ones about the panthers, bears, wolves, and other wild animals. I cant wait to read the next book, and the one after that, and all the rest. I think anyone would enjoy this book."
5,Learn about history while reading a great story!,"I would recommend this book to kids ages 7-100. I will still love it when I'm older and I'm only 8! This book is full of funny stories, history, and stuff you really never knew. The story moved along very quickly so I never got bored. I can't wait to read her next book."
5,The toughest one yet!,"When I first began using this DVD, firm cardio, I found the instructor uninteresting. She wasn't extremely enthusiastic and she was monotone when giving instruction. However, the more I did it, the more I enjoyed it. It does use alot of weights, but it also combines cardio. The firm strength DVD is just as much fun, but somehow, the firm cardio I find to be tougher than the firm strenth, but I love them both!!"
3,**** Cream-[ light ] ****,"First off , just let me say that I am a HUGE fan of Cream !.....Now with THAT said ; I thought this c.d. was pretty mediocre....Yes, I'm happy that they got back together..and I realize the 37 years that have passed ...but IMO , this sounds more like a really good cover band than actual Cream.....if you want to hear what they sounded like in their PRIME , then I would suggest picking up 'Cream Live Volumes # 1 and 2 ' especially the re-masters....and if you REALLY want to hear what they sound like in TOP form then pick up the 4 c.d. box set ' Those were the days '......I have seen the dvd package of this same album, and my feelings are similar....novelty more than obsession !"
3,"Tired, sweating, and straining, but still awesome...","Well, Cream were essentially a jam band, never having made their impact with songwriting or albums (although everyone should pick up WHEELS OF FIRE), and this point is in great evidence throughout. I still love the Band the most (yes, that's the group that forced Clapton to break up Cream in the first place) and I wish they would have been more faithful to the old Cream days, but still it's great just to see them playing again. Jack does look sickly, but I think he's just exhausted. Yet how can that be? They slow ""Crossroads"" down to a jazz beat (I was hoping to see the lightning solo that Eric played on the version we all know and love) and Eric does most of the singing on ""White Room"". But oh well, one could have some reservations, but this is the new Cream. In that light, it's an essential concert, and I hope they get back into the studio soon and wow us with a new (hopefully good) record."
2,Out of sync,"I was watching this on KCET and had to find a place to comment. A few minutes after I started watching it I noticed parts were out of sync. Then I watched closer. Everything was out of sync! Clapton's playing a chord when you hear a ripping solo. That bad. Lips are moving, but no words begin to come out for a few more seconds. The music is awesome, but don't get this to watch Clapton rip it up. It just doesn't work.5 Stars for the music... Go and buy the CD instead."
4,welcome reunion,"This video documents the reunion of Cream and it doesn't disapoint. Yes they are older and Crossroads is reimagined, but the band is in fine form. Audio on this disc is top notch. Video quality is okay, not exactly a demo disc in that regard, but that is a minor complaint. I got this disc more for the sound than the picture. The only drawback is that it will only play in a HD-DVD player."
1,Definitely not the same band,"as the band from the 60's. Different instruments,Different recording techniques,and totally different feel,newer is not always better.The only reason to own this would be for Ginger's great drum solo."
4,Best Live Cream Yet,"I'm sure the title of this review will lose many others who treasure Wheels of Fire, the Live Cream volumes, as well as the Goodbye album and they are pretty high on my list too but I have to say this is my favorite live cream offering yet. There is more focus, cohesion, and lyricism to the performances. Everyone has aged well in their craft, and songs like Spoonful or Sweet Wine in shorter versions make for a more varied and entertaining record. If it weren't for the record company leaving off Sitting On Top of the World with ample room on the second disc, I would give it five stars. That having been said, I do agree with a couple of other reviewers though, in that you need to see the DVD first to get the full appreciation of this record."
5,If you love CREAM then buy this DVD,"Overall it is a fine collection of performances taken from those historic evenings at the Royal Albert Hall. When I hear and see Eric, Jack and Ginger play those songs from the past, I can only think of one analogy: Fine Wine. The sound is so refined and mature that it is hard to watch this DVD without a smile on your face. The overall feeling is one of happiness and deep respect and love each shows one another as well as the music. I purchased the Farewell concert and the differences between the two is large. Before they were like young tigers, fearless in their playing and going at it with incredible pace and passion. Now they are truly masters of their instruments as well as their level of musicianship. We should all be very grateful that this reunion was able to take place. It is a true gem to enjoy!"
5,Touching story of a poor girl living in France,"Cecile is a young girl living in 16th Century France. She and her father have little money to support themselves, and are barely getting by. But when she discovers a woman in the middle of the woods, crying for help, her life changes drastically.The woman turns out to be the queen. Cecile comes to her rescue, and in turn, the queen hires her as a servant. Cecile knows the money will benefit her family, so she gows to work in the palace.Very well done."
4,Good for younger readers,"I thought this was good for the age that it was aimed for, with an admirable heroine. The author did a good job describing the surroundings, and keeping the plot moving along.However, I thought the romance was rather uneccesary. What was the point?I will probably read more in this series, this one was my first."
4,Psychosis shown more dramatic,"This movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" can show the viewers what schizophrenia under psychosis is like - how serious the psychotic person's case is. More serious than other psychotic patients, like digging out his arm. His wife importantly explained to him how to differentiate between reality and schizophrenia's false visions and false voices.I find this movie interesting that there are such people who are down with psychosis or schizophrenia, can be geniuses and even can be back to sane mind.This movie was produced by the directors of the movies who may never have experienced psychosis or schizophrenia so they produced such movies in their own understanding level, not psychotic experiences."
4,An Excellent Movie,"My complaints about the movie would have to be that it was too long, and in some parts I found it to be a bit confusing. However, I thought everything else about the movie was well done. The character developement of Alicia Nash was well played, and the delusions were amazing. They pulled you in, and you thought it was going to be some sort of spy action movie, but felt betrayed when you realized the truth. All in all, I would recommend it."
2,Over-rated,"I was disappointed in this movie because the book is so much better. Russell Crowe is great....It's too bad that Ron Howard is afraid to take chances and always has to play it safe. If everyone thought like him, there would've been no ""American Beauty"" or ""Pulp Fiction""...I recommend watching one of those movies instead of this one. If Ron Howard made Pulp Fiction or American Beauty, can you imagine how boring they would've been? The dark aspects of the characters is what made those movies interesting...This is clearly what is missing in ""A Beautiful Mind."" The movie is watered-down to cater to the masses...The director sold out and made a McMovie."
5,Wonderful,I was very pleased with this product ! I got speedy service and a great product. I will be buying from these people again.Thanks for your exceptional profromance ! Marqueta
3,"nice, but not Oscar worthy","I admit I was moved by the movie, but it's not the sort of film I go on discussing the day after. Not like Moulin Rouge, Lord of the Rings and Amelie. All these three contributed major stuff to movie history. A Beautiful Mind was , well, just a plainly beautiful movie.Was it my imagination or did they actually spell Nobel as Noble on the prop seal? I can't believe they'd make a mistake on such a major thing as this."
3,"A Beautiful Mind, An OK Movie","I have to say that I was pretty dissapointed with this movie. The media and all the awards it got made it look like a fantastic movie, but I didn't really care for it. The only reason I watched it was my cousin forced me too. He probably only liked it because he has this ""thing"" for Russel Crowe. I thought it was kinda strange and a little hard to follow. This movie is kind of like biography that belongs on A&E, not on the big screen. I was pretty bored through a lot of the movie. Sure, it's cool and everything how smart the guy was and all the things he did, but the movie was just hideously boring. I'm not even sure I agree with the 3 stars I gave it. Sorry, but pass this movie up. It's more of a ""there's nothing else left at the store, I guess we could rent this"" movie. For those of you out there that liked this movie.... Enjoy!"
2,Really not impressed.,"I knew this movie would be a disappointment, and I was right. It left me untouched, unmoved, and failed to evoke any emotions in me. Acting was OK. Story and plot were weak. Nothing much happens here. There is very little to keep anyone awake or interested. And yes, as many viewers point out, the whole ""love saves the day"" thing made me nauseous. After ""Gladiator"" won Best Picture last year, I knew anything the Academy did afterwards would be utterly ridiculous. I was right again. This was a potentially interesting premise totally squandered by sentiment, cliche and swelling violins. Ugh, the more I think about it, the more I don't like it."
5,Great Movies,It's one of the best movies that I've seen in a long time. Russell Crowe is very believable in the lead role. He should be nominated for an acamedy award. Since I didn't know anything about the story I was left me not knowing what was real and what wasn't and I was totally shocked to find out it was a true story.It's definately worth seeing.
4,"Entertaining, but far from accurate","Ron Howard made an entertaining film, but opted to change the chronolgy of many events, completely omit others and substantially change facts. There is no mention of Elenor and John Strier, his first girlfriend and firstborn son. He never goes to RAND in California and thus is never arrested in a sting to nab homosexuals. John's trips to Europe and his attempts to give up his US citizenship is never depicted. His son Johnny's battle with Schizophrenia is omitted. His divorce from Alicia is also never mentioned. It is understandable that some changes were made in the screenplay, but the movie only resembles his real life in a vague way."
5,An incredible movie,"Since the first time I viewed this movie, I was fascinated in a lot of factors, camera, directing, and a little bit of the acting was also very good, though in some scenes it seems like I'm watching Gladiator.A great movie for a great price, a ""must have"" item."
5,A Beautiful Movie,This is one beautiful film I had waited for for months to see after seeing Russell Crowe last year while on his US tour with his band. It lives up to its hype from beginning to end. Russell Crowe mastrfully takes the viewer on a journey to hell and back. A FILM NOT TO BE MISSED!!!
3,A Portrait of Mental Illness,"A Beautiful Mind shares the story of John Nash, a brilliant mathematician whose private life was filled with fear and frustration due to mental illness. I found the movie much better than the book. However the book is more factual. The movie tends to over-dramatize a life story that is already dramatic enough."
3,WOW!!! Mind Blowing,"I recently watched A Beautiful Mind with my boyfriend this last week. I watched it for a psychology class that I am taking. I was amazed by the acting in this movie. I was also astonished by this being a true story. In our society today, someone like John Nash would be crucified. His extreme knowledge would be dismissed. I believe that Ron Howard did an excellent job directing this film."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An often-moving story, A Beautiful Mind sometimes rambles or takes too long on a dead end of a plotline, but deserves praise for taking one of the most formulaic genres (the biopic) and doing something completely different, mainly successfully."
2,i didnt like it that much,"i dont know about everybody else, but i didnt see what the fuss was about with this film. maybe i was just biased with Lord of the Rings, which was by far the better film last year, but i didnt like this film that much. i think one true mark of a good film is if there are memorable scenes. i can only think of two scenes in this movie that i consider memorable: the bar scene where he figures out his equation, and near the end when the guy from the Nobel Peace prize shows up. he greets the professor who immediately stops one of his students to ask him if he can see someone where this representative was. that was a memorable scene. but it just seemed to be a slow movie to me that i didnt enjoy as much. then again, i really didnt want this movie to win best picture. Lord of the Rings deserved that honor."
1,A Tired Parade of Cliches,"You've already seen this movie. You don't need to see it again. A Beautiful Mind never once rises above the merely serviceable. It never rises above the level of the usual fairly competently made TV movie.Emotional payoffs are telegraphed a full two hours in advance. The music swells dramatically to tell you to start crying. It's almost like a Spielberg film, except that Ron Howard doesn't have Spielberg's considerable talents.Russell Crowe does a fairly good job, but all too often is content just to bring out a series of ticks and grins and mumbles. He basically gets by on his considerable charisma and charm. If the film is at all watchable, it is due to him. Ed Harris does next to nothing, and basically makes the easiest paycheck of his entire career.There is really no reason to see this film. There are better motion pictures out there. You'll easily find one. Just look."
5,A Beautiful Illness,"I highly recommend this movie to anybody and everybody. Russell Crowe delivers one of the best performances of his career, if not his best. Knowing this movie is a true story makes you even more intrigued to see what's going to happen next. This movie is definitely a must see drama that's worth your time and money tima and time again."
3,"Good, but...","Interesting story, whether accurate or not. Excellent acting by Crowe, Connelly and, as always, Ed Harris. Way too long, the story could have been adequately & eloquently told in under 2 hours.And the music! The entire viewing experience would have been more captivating and less maudlin with an occasional change in tempo. I found myself thinking too often ""I got the point half an hour ago, move on.""Too bad. I really like Ron Howard movies, appreciate a good story, and such outstanding acting is not to be overlooked or undermined. My recommendation is to make sure you are in a very patient frame of mind when you head out the door to see this one. You will be glad you didn't waste your movie money on a mindless action film or one of the ever-prevalent animated adventures, but this movie may put you in the mood to see another movie!Sorry, Opie."
1,An Insult to Artistic Decency!!!,"I should have walked out of this movie 30 minutes into the show. I am amazed at the level of ""cookie-cutter"" sentimentality and plot ploys that were contrived to produce this movie. The dialogue was so lame I found myself audibly snorting in disbelief. And what about Jennifer Connelly? Was that acting? Rusell Crowe did a two-star job under horrible, flat directing. A Beautiful Mind insults all of our original and good instincts. What a piece of garbage!!"
1,"Cookie-cutter plot, acting, movie","This is the bastard child of Fight Club and Good Will Hunting, and it inherited none of the good looks or wit of either.A real shocker of a film, it insulted my own intelligence with it's ham-fisted plot. The only highlight of the film was the surprise half way through (from which point, it loses all direction).What a turkey!"
3,Deeply Over-rated,"This is a fine movie, a good film, watchable, enjoyable, entertaining and, at times, informing. What it is not is groundbreaking, compelling, affecting or, simply, great.Russel Crowe's performance was typically good, but nowhere near his stunning turn in The Insider. In this movie he is playing the troubled genius, and there's really nothing all that new to his performance.Beyond Russel Crowe, everything else is sort of facile. Technically well executed, the film simply doesn't have the impact that many of it's reviews--and accolades--would seem to indicate."
5,Great Product!,It was a great experience. The product arrived earlier than expected and it was brand new.
5,Punshing Crowe got Robbed!!,"Although Crowe's behavior might have cost him the Oscar this does not take away from his brilliant performance as John Nash. I still don't understand how ""A Beautiful Mind"" could win best supporting actress and best picture and Crowe not win for best actor when his performance makes the movie. Conelly although good as Nash's wife is by no means better than Crowe and the movie would not have been what it is (a masterpiece) without Crowe's Performance. If your interested in the Psychology of the human mind or if you just want to see a great performance you should run to see ""A Beautiful Mind""."
2,remarkably un-original...,"The Performances were exceptional, but that was about it. The pace of the film was really unbalanced, lingering in the wrong places, rushing through others. It didn't even cover Nash's life very well, leaving out a lot of key points, but focusing intensely on some of the less interesting aspects. A lot of things were never explained. It just felt way too long, but at the same time incomplete. Thus, it was very, very boring. Ron Howard has kept up his tradition of following strict Hollywood formulas, steering clear of any originality the script even had potential to offer. This movie wasn't terrible, but it's nowhere near worthy of the praise it's recieved let alone the Best Picture award."
2,Read This Book Only If You're Trapped On a Desert Island,"The title explains it all. This book has a very slow pace with tons of extra ""fluff"" detail. The characters are quite likeable, but for me, that still didn't do much for the book overall. I'd say skip it unless a volleyball named Wilson is your only friend."
2,Great book about Friendship,To be honest with everyone I did not like the book at all. Others may think differently though. It did not grab my attention nor my interest. I did read the whole thing and I found out that it was a very touching story. It talked about all the things the characters had to go through to become famous and the way your life changes when you reach that point. The relationship between the two main characters was really nice I liked how they worked together. It was as if they were married to each other even though one of them was the head of the two of them. The novel showed how friends can take advantage of you and your life and basically become the person you worry about when you make big important life decisions. I definately do not see this novel as being a new England Novel even though Elizabeth McCracken is from New England. A lot of my friends did enjoy the book so even though I mentioned I disliked it others will find it highly interesting.
2,"My eyelids fell, too","I expected to love this because I admired ""The Giant's House."" However, I found the prose plodding and the pacing more like trudging.(Maybe it just suffers in comparison to the last book I read, also touching on vaudeville, ""Carter Beats the Devil."" Can't recommend that one too highly.)So much of this story centers on accepting Rocky's charisma, and yet he never seemed like a real person to me.It's rare for me to skim whole pages hoping that the momentum of the story picks up, but that's what I found myself doing more and more."
1,poor tent,"I went hunting this weekend and it rained and snowed. This tent could not take any of it!! One pole bent under a little snow and the floor leaked!!! Worst tent I have ever used. I AM GOING TO JUST DUMP THIS IN THE TRASH AND CHALK IT UP TO A LOSS. I WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE IT TO ANYONE. Don't even consider this thing. Pay the price and get a good tent, like I should have."
3,Great potential but oddly disatisfying...,"Vocals from Peabo Bryson and Nancy Wilson are the highlights of this album. Pretty Women from Sweeney Todd is a wonderful sensitive interpretation. Likewise the lovely duet from Passion, Loving You. The instrumental pieces are generally OK but suffer without lyrics, since there is a repetitiveness in some of Sondheim's work that is saved only by the poetry of his words. Holly Cole misses the point totally providing flawed and narrow interpretations which destroy the Sondheim magic. I usually play the first six tracks and skip the rest. Despite this, I still believe in Sondheim's genius."
2,Maybe Not,"Maybe this only works for movie stars, but it didn't work for me. Sure it dries the pimple (small ones) but it doesn't make them disappear. If you have bad acne - forget it. Moderate - maybe it will work. Light - probably will work.Don't know, I'm not a doctor, but this was a waste of money."
3,"Not bad, but mic sound quality could be better","This is the same headset as comes in the box with the Q105. Thesound you hear through the earbud is quite good. The micpicks up your voice quite well no matter which way you headis turned, which is not bad considering it just hangs offthe earbud next to your neck. The only thing I can faultit on is the mic's sounds quality: your voice will soundrather tinny to people on the other end. (The mic in theQ105 itself provides much better sound than this.) Still,people on the other end could understand me well enough andthis headset is certainly light and small enough to easilycarry around. So overall I'd say it's worth 3 stars."
2,Not enough content...,"When I purchased this book, I was disappointed to see that there wasnt much information on actual Druidism. The book was more based around Wicca."
1,"Athames, pentacles, and no real Druidic content","Hate to break it to people, but the historical Druids did NOT hold the number 5 in such high regard as Ms. Knight likes to believe. Nor is there any evidence to suggest that the historical Druids used athames or pentacles, or that they cast circles, or any of the rest of the quasi-Wiccish nonsense Ms. Knight tries to present as Druidic tradition. This isn't Druidry. It's what happens when one takes neo-Wiccan fluff and paints over it with Celtic knots."
5,Must have,This is really a great book just downward blocks very interesting I think this is another of the karate books that need to be on the rack For anyone who practice the arts!
5,Good Read,"we can all do better in society and this book was required by Cleveland State University for BS degree, but I enjoyed it a lot."
2,This book,"I personally don't like this book too much. The readings are dull, and boring, but yet, I can still relate."
2,"Only if your a fan,and then with caution","Totally self serving Ghost written Bio,on a not very interesting man,But if you think this guy is worth a book..go ahead at your own risk"
1,great deal,This product was even nicer than I imagined. Very nice quality and I was certainly satisfied.
2,Photosmart Review,"This item did not work correctly. The photo docking station was supposed to charge the camera, but did not. It took fine pictures in the 5 minutes that it would hold a charge. It had to be returned and was more trouble than it was worth."
5,camera and printer,"it was a gift to my daughter,from what i've been told it was a great gift and very ;much appreciated.thank yourichard du chemin"
5,One of the best yet...,"Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong...They could have left the title at that. This book does a great job of explaining cultural differences, history, education, politics, attitudes toward food, dating and many things we anglophones are curious about. There was no need to add the snarky ""Why we love France but not the French"". Was that to sell more books during a time of anti-French sentiment? It took me 3 more years to buy the book, which is after all, quite good. Bad title! I have many friends in France, speak it fluently and agree with the authors that there is much more to learn than words. More to selling books than naming them too, it would appear!"
1,Could not view,I am not able to review this item because I downloaded it and when I went to watch it I received the message that the content could not be found.
3,A Very Lukewarm Beat Down,The plot is somewhat cliched. The acting is not as good as the first Beat Down movie with Sean Faris. The interaction among the characters is almost non existent. A little more flesh from the principal actors would not have hurt either. I have not thrown the DVD away but it is a disappointment.
4,good practical tips for living with an RSI,"I disagree with the reviews below, I thought this is a fine book, a good complement to the books ""It's Not Carpal Tunnel Syndrome"" by Damany and "" Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Other Repetitive Strain Injuries"" by Sharon Butler. It's true the latter two have much more on specific exercises to help get you better and I liked the medical information in Damany. However they don't have a lot of practical information on how to cope with your life during the healing process when you can't do a lot of the things you normally do in your daily life. This book fills that gap. It's got lots of practical suggestions of how to do things when you're injured. It's more of broader focus than the other books on the overall changes you need to make beyond the specific exercise program. I would recommed someone with an RSI get all three books as the information is complementary."
4,Beautiful!,"Love the cello, LOVE Pau Casals (my all time favourites are the Bach: Cello Suites Nos. 1-6), this is a beautiful collection albeit somewhat uneven. Still worthwhile!"
4,Does the job!,Very good quality for the money you pay. I used it for PS2 which worked fine. Good product.
3,Judith McNaught? Not even close.,"I purchased this book after another reviewer stated that she was a fan of Linda Howard and was looking for an author who was just as good. She said she found that author in Judith McNaught. Needless to say, I'm a big fan of JM and was intrigued that another author could match her standards; so I purchased this book. I was very disappointed. This book was so predictable and there was no romance. More like bam slam thank you ma'am; Dane and Marlie were living together one week after meeting??!! There was no chemistry. I also think the author put information into the book as a shock factor. I love a good romance and I love a good thriller. This was neither. Just not my cup of tea."
1,two sizes smaller than labeled,just did not fit! way too tight and small compared to all other clothing of that same size that I have ordered on the web
2,You get what you pay for...,"Fast shipping which was good, as for the item? Well it is okay if you like to repair things you just bought. One of the straps was sewn on twisted so I had to cut it and repair it. I would have sent it back but I had already washed it as I always wash new apparel before I wear it. That is when I realized the strap was twisted. I also bought a white cami and that one was fine. I suppose you get what you pay for in the end, may-be that is why they were cheaper than the other products listed? Would I buy from this seller again? I might give them one more chance. Thank-you."
3,Great quality but sizing is off,"This product is fantastic in all aspects except one. I normally wear a medium in these types of tops - so I ordered a medium. When I got them I was impressed with the quality of the product, from the material to the craftsmanship. However when I tried one on it was so tight I nearly couldn't. So I sent them back in exchange for a large. I received the large and tried one on...still quite tight but decided I could live with it.So, if you want to order this product and think you are a medium you may want to order a large or even an extra large...just to be safe."
3,NOT BAD PRETTY GIRLS AND LOTS OF ACTION,"For its genre, I thought this film was pretty good; it has gorgous women and lots of action. I saw it on Cinemax the other evening where it can be taped. I recommend it highly.The acting is not bad at all, I think."
3,Love the B-meyer fence...but what about all the dust,"I have owned this saw for about 1 1/2 years and I have found it is powerful enough to cut through everything I have put in front of it. The Biesmeyer fence is rock solid. My only complaint is a huge one for me and that is the dust collection inadequacies of this saw. I worked in my home's basement for 1 year and this saw made that arrangement impossible. Short of building a dust collection stand under the saw (Wood Magazine Oct. 2003) there is no way to collect the saw dust. I have moved to the garage and continue to use this saw. I am really sorry I did not forsee the dust problem and pay the $$$$$ for a cabinet saw. The fence is great, but I expect more for the money."
2,Forgot his target audience.,"I admit this book has a lot of historical information, but the author leans a bit too much in the debunking direction. I can read all the reasons why the Earth isn't hollow in dozens of studies by 'respectable academics' so I was disappointed that Mr. Godwin seams so concerned with hedging his bets and waffling around the obviously conspiratorial nature of this subject. Sorry, there's no point in examining both points of view in cases such as this- one is a lie and one is the truth, and neither wants anything to do with the other. Don't try to compare and weigh them. Very disappointing."
4,The last thing that Johnny tried to release,"I was so impressed by 'Walking into mirrors' that I could hardly wait the release of his new work in Spain. I manged to hear some of the tracks on a radio station, that got them from a tape, before the album was released. In the end, the album never was published, at least in Spain. Therefore, when many years afterwards I saw the opportunity of getting it I did not doubt for a second.It is true that this work is not so brilliant as 'Walking ...', which I consider a masterwork, but nevertheless it includes two or three tracks as beautiful as to make it worthwhile to get the CD. For example, 'I love my planet', as tender and emotive in its simplicity that I never get tired of hearing it."
2,NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL!,"Well, I know a lot of people like this film, but I have to tell it like it is!......it's not a very good remake at all! Schroder may be adorable, but he is way out of his league going up against Jackie Cooper and although the rest of the cast are top notch, this film feels like a bad TV movie! The first problem is Schroder is too young for the role to be taken for more than sympathy and it's no more than a manipulative trick. I'm not saying Schroder didn't do a fine job, but it's easy to feel sorry for such a little tike crying over his fallen hero who is also his father! If you like the story, watch the original, it's infinitely better than this Hollywood mediocre melodrama."
4,A most excellent insight into history of impacts from the Bible...,"This book was a really great read. This starts with the history of who could read the bible (priests mainly) up to the translation of the bible so that common man could read it (under King James and Henry VIII). With such an empowerment, the people of England broke from Roman Catholicism (and the influence of Puritism and Lutherism started), and the English people took up the cause for Israel, and in the long run, it lead to the twentieth century push for Israel to become a state. The book also covers Britains strategic move to keep conflict amongst the Turks, Arabs and Jews by establishing Israel amongst them. This book was really good with so many facts of history and presented neutrally. This is not Barbara Tuchman's best writing but it a very good book to understand the political control that the Bible had over the shaping of the countries today. Very good book!!"
3,Ponderous Reading,"The information in the book is worthwile but Ms Touchman's style makes it difficult to get to. It is similar to the laborious process of getting the meat out of a blue crab. Many of the acecdotes she uses to punctuate her theme are redundant, her language and phrasing are cumbersome, and she assumes a knowlede of history not posessed by many people.The book would have been much kinder to the reader if she provided greator historical perspective by tying the chapters together with a few paragraphs at the beginning of each describing what happened in the intervening years.Ms Taubman is a brilliant woman and the content is worthwile. However the style is ponderous. I'm not likely to read another of her books. I'm sure that she is a first rate academician but am at a complete loss in trying to understand her acclaim as a writer."
4,just one flaw,Over all the movie was great only when the bridge fell in the movie it was night time and in real life the bridge fell during day time.
2,Dissapointing...,"While browsing through Blockbuster for a movie to rent, I read the back of this and saw that Blockbuster recommended Stir of Echoes and the Sixth Sense along with this, so I decided to rent this since I had loved both of the recommended movies. However, this movie, especially the ending, was dissapointing. From start to finish the movie makes little sense and you'll find yourself falling asleep as you watch it. If you're looking for a good movie of a similar drama, check out ""Stir of Echoes"" starring Kevin Bacon."
2,Nothing more than a bad X-Files episode,"I really, really thought I was going to enjoy this film. However, from the get-go I saw nothing but tired old predictable cliches in music, cinematography, and effects. I was not scared by anything, because I could always sense (or prophecise) what was about to happen; except for the ending, which actually, through its tension and timing and effects, makes up for the rest of the bland, pointless journey through this film. In general, the performances are top-notch, and the fact that this film is based on some reportedly true events will create some intrigue; but basically this film is really nothing more than a bad episode of The X-Files.What would have improved this DVD experience for me is if a documentary about the supposedly ""true story"", of which this film was based on, was included. I think I would have found the latter to be much more interesting than the film itself."
5,Creeeeeeeeeepy! ( and sort of true!),"This is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie. It conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere. Once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of TOMANDANDY helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since DON'T LOOK NOW back in '73. This was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out, alongside WHITE NOISE, as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of The success of THE SIXTH SENSE."
1,Horrible,"Not worth a long, well-thought-out review. Avoid at all cost. not scary at all. There is more horror and violence in a Scooby Doo cartoon, then this horrible written movie."
1,God Awful don't waste your time or money,"I swa this film when it first came out, I was looking forward to seeing it because I love these kinds of films (Blair Witch project, The Sixth Sence, etc.) but boy was I disaponted. I thought in the beging this is going to pick up any minute they're just setting things up, but they weren't occasionaly something disturbing happened but by the time this film was half why threw I was beging for the credits to roll and free me from this tedious chour of sitting threw this painful slow and uninteresting story the end was not done well it happened far to quickly to justify ny tourture although it struck me more than it would others considering that it actually happened to the rout my father traveled at that time on a weekly basis."
4,Good Covers,"These covers are good. However, they do not truly fit an 11 foot square umbrella. There is about 2 inches of fabric still showing. BUT, for the price I'll keep them. I couldn't find anything this inexpensive around here. I like the zipper but I wish the pole had a place to attach a string to bring the zipper down (I hate standing on the table to do this)."
4,Battery Wars,I bought this battery after trying several less expensive batteries from another vendor that did not hardly work at all. This battery did not last quite as long as the new battery that came with the phone but did last about 3 days without recharging when used lightly.
5,Outstanding,"I bought this album as an 8-track years ago, then I bought it as a cassette and now I've bought it as a cd...It is outstanding"
3,Disc - victime of polliticaly correct,"There's no Best of J.C. vith any song from this rarity record. It's no good to remember the american-indians genocide. He had a currage. But this disc is forgotten, it's not fair."
4,Home,"I'd had it in mind to get this recording for a while. The song about the Seneca is about my home. It's where I came from. I was 3 years old when they had The Removal from our homes for the Kinzua dam. I never really knew life before the relocation areas, except through my elders. We have our own version of what happened, and how it happened. The US gov't. knew our attachment to the land, and they wanted to break us. The alternative plan to Kinzua would have better served the purpose that the gov't. put out for doing what they did. They rejected that plan because they had they're own plan. They thought our spirit lived in the land, they didn't understand that each person's spirit lives inside them. They had lost touch with they're own spirit, and they thought that they could do the same with us. They were wrong. The song does a fair job of portraying this."
2,Only for windows,This product only for windows. I bought this because I tought fit with my Mac. So if you have Mac don't buy this product bcoz it gonna be useless
1,Gold end broke off immediately,"End broke off!! Another reveiewer stated that the gold end broke off after plugging and unplugging the cable repeatedly. I only unplugged it probably twice, and the gold end snapped off. Very Disappointed."
5,Wonderful Performances,"There are two trios recorded on this CD, the Brahms C Major, Op. 87 (recorded in June of 1952 at the Prades Festival) and the Mendelssohn D Minor, Op. 49 (recorded in November of 1961 at the White House). We generally hear Brahms chamber music performed in a brash, emphatic style but here it is played in a restrained and loving way. I listened to another Casals performance of this work recorded at the 1955 Prades festival (with Menuhin and Istomin) and found the approach similar.The Mendelssohn is simply beautiful, a performance befitting this very special occasion. Did Casals ever play anything at anytime that was ever less than inspired and inspiring?The sound on this recording shows it's age but takes nothing away from one's pleasure."
4,Horror Express,Super Good vary well madeand the story is vary well acted out one of the old time best in the 70's
1,How can I put it... ?,"I am amazed that this uninspired record got released at all. The piano pieces endlessly and pointlessly noodle and thrash through their sub-Nymanesque calisthenics with de-rigour postmodern fake melancholia. The sub-'New Romantic' vocals bleakly warble out their dreary sentiments with no real sense of direction, while the piano ploughs on and on. The production reminds one of the worst of Spandau Ballet, Tears For Fears, etc., an era of pap best forgotten even if you had to grow up with it. Indeed, it must have been quite a task in itself to concoct something this boring, monochrome, adolescent, and lacking in drama - hence the one star. I'm afraid that even the track titles give the game away; the whole thing, as one can easily see from its cover, is clearly the work of a poseur. Can we not give negative stars?"
4,Great value,"Time can only tell if this Delta will outlast the competitive Performax. I can tell you that at the time of purchase, Delta was the better value. Free Stand, free mobile base, 2 boxes of sand paper... 2 extra inches on the drum, $100 rebate. Wow! Great value!"
1,Do NOT purchase this sander!,"I had this drum/thickness sander for over a year and thought it was really good UNTIL the table raising and lowering mechanism got out of alignment. As other reviewers have noted, this is a common problem with this machine. I spent around 14 hours of my own time trying to adjust everything properly following the instructions in the manual and gave up in complete exasperation. I took it to the warranty repair shop here in town and after working on it awhile THEY GAVE UP also. They had ordered some new parts and tried to get it back to functioning, but they simply could not get the table to raise and lower.Fortunately it was the X5 version with a 5 year warranty so in the end I was able to get all my money back and purchase a Jet/Performax 22-44 which I like much better. My advice, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THE DELTA!"
4,GETS THE JOB DONE,"HAD FOR ABOUT 3 YEARS NOW AND USE ROUTINELY. THE DRUM AND TABLE WERE OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND I HAVE SINCE CORRECTED ON MY OWN. THE FEED BELT IS DIFFICULT TO GET TRACKING PROPERLY. ONCE YOU GET THE FEEL OF THE MACHINE AND ITS LIMITS ACCURATE SURFACES WITH 1/64 FROM EDGE TO EDGE CAN BE EXPECTED AND NO MORE. THE DRUM IS OPEN ON BOTH ENDS AND OFTEN GETS LOADED WITH DUST CAUSING AN OVERLOAD/VIBRATION PROBLEM - A AIR BLOW OUT CORRECTS THE PROBLEM. DELTA COULD EASILY CAP THE ENDS OF THE DRUM AND ELIMINATE THIS PROBLEM ALL TOGEATHER, A SIMPLE PLASTIC CAP. DON'T EXPECT THIS MACHINE TO SOLVE ALL YOUR SNDING WOES. CHANGING THE SANDING GRIT IS A PAIN ON ANY DRUM SANDER. I KEEP A 100-120 GRIT LOADED FOR MOST PROJECTS AND FINISH SAND BY ELECTRIC SNADER."
2,Delta 31-255X X5 18Drum Sander,I've had the sander for a couple of years. Get extra sanding belts as they clog or burn. (I usually use the sander for maple & cherry) Also have a set of american sized allen wrenches & regular wrenches handy because you'll need them often. Sander works O.K. but not ready for prime time.
2,Not Impressed,I took the exam after studying this book.....the book address basic content whereas the test did not. The test was about application and use of appropriate curriculmn
2,simply waste,"one star cause they're organicone star cause they're pure and nothing added like sugar or sobut they reached me mostly pulverized,0,75 ounce are not really satisfyingand actually they're missing tastenow i will go back to the good old raisins and dried cranberrys etc."
4,Tasty and Green,"I liked this. It was a nice tasty alternative to fresh fruit. Sometimes you can't do fresh on the go, but this I keep in my car for those quick craving fixes. It is only 1 point if you follow the WW plan. Of course it's green for the environment! Organic, you just can't go wrong there. Will buy again."
3,Dried Cherry Berry 0.75 oz,I love blueberries but the ones in this pouch remind me of burnt crumbs. I pick them out and eat the rest.
4,"Great Product, with a flaw or two","2013 UPDATE: This product has been discontinued.This product is decent. It provides a nice amount of crunch-dried (a tad different than freeze-dried) fruit with a great taste. While there are mostly apples, the other fruits are represented well enough.The only problem is the fruit dust. Because of the shape of the package, the only way to get fruit out is to tip the pack. Unfortunately, fruit dust always resides at the bottom and easily creates a mess if one is not careful.All in all, I recommend this product and hope that the organic version of this will be chosen over the non-organic. With apples being number two on the foods most contaminated with pesticides, organic is the only option."
2,Hinds' Feet on High Places,The book was definitely old and yellowed but totally in tact otherwise. It was appropriately priced and well worth it!
5,powerful story,This tells a story of one's walk with Jesus. I could relate all along. Excellent small book.
5,I could so relate to the heroin in this book.,"If you have a problem with fear, dealing with a difficult life, or struggle with low self esteem this book will change you perspective for the better."
5,One of the best,"This book is a classic for a reason. The story is amazing, the characters are US and the Chief Shepard is a beautiful word portrait of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Its about each and every one of our journeys with the Lord..a must read for all christians."
2,Too much flex,"I already own 'The Big Stick' and it's a great product. This one however falls short.I picked this one up so I could have something small at work to use since I'm terrible with getting around to using it at home.The size is good and all, however there is far too much flex on this thing which does not allow me to get enough pressure on my target areas. The core rod is thinner than the larger models and therefore causes all this flex. I would say stick with something larger. This may be good for light work, but not for heavy tension such as I have."
2,The Mitfords make Paris & Lindsay look like upstanding citizens.,"Just read this for my book club and OY, OY, OY, did I ever hate it. I really did not find any of the sisters to be sympathetic. They were so spoiled and out of touch with reality. Furthermore, they were so mean to each other. I also had a hard time keeping them straight with all of their stupid nicknames. The biographer's apologetic yet pedantic tone bugged the hell out of me. Lady, we all get the peerage system and the nanny system. Oh and BTW, hobnobbing with Nazis does not make one fascinating; it makes one despicable, even if you are the most classically beautiful woman to grace the world. How bout another OY for good measure... OY!"
2,Outbreak + Snakephobia = Venomous,"This is an interesting film about an outbreak of a deadly virus in the same town that Invasion of the Body Snatchers is supposed to take place in. As our hero follows the clues he discovers the poisonous snakes are the villains. As the town is quarantined and about to be nuked by the presidents orders, Treat Williams must act fast to find a way to stop the mayhem that's going down. There's a nice commentary on the DVD, which helps explain various things. It's a nice effort."
5,More than a book -,"Warren Henson's ''Older Love'' is more than a book, it's the kind of greeting card lovers would (and should) give to each other.The term ''older love'' can be taken two ways -- as love that has endured over time, or as love between two older people. Either way you take it or however it fits your relationship, ''Older Love'' makes a most romantic gift. Hardcover with oversized pages, it's easy to read, is beautifully illustrated, and at today's going rate for ordinary greeting cards, it is an exceptional value!If you're looking for the perfect anniversary, birthday, Valentine's, or ''just because'' gift for someone you love... may I recommend ''Older Love''."
2,Sometime you do get what you pay for,"I was expecting a single combo kit. What arrived was a mishmash of stuff. All very ""cheap""."
5,MUST HAVE!!,This book is a must have for any wiccan. It has everything you'll looking for in one simple book. It truly is a complete book of shadows. It is a must have for your collection.
4,It works for me.,"This book is great. It's the right size,is durable,and has plenty of space to write your exercise, the reps and the weight. Having this journal keeps me on track and because there's so many pages. It allows you can go back and check either your progress or what you've done at the gym over the last year or so."
5,Awesome logbook for serious people,I bought this book for my son who is a serious weight lifter and power lifter. He records all his routines and workout sessions in it. He loves it and gave one to his friend to use.
1,Fine for weightlifting but nothing else,"This is basically a weightlifting log. It has space to record different lifts, weight, sets, reps, etc, but this crowds out room for recording any other type of ""workout"". The book also has some grids where, hilariously, you can record the measured size of almost every muscle on your body several times per year. Avoid this if you're interested in anything other than weightlifting."
5,"blubberboy rocks,ha!","I like that band blubberboy,whoops,I meanloverboy,ha!this is another great list ofhits that bring back a lot of good memories fromthe 80's,loverboy is a great band,and this is agood one to buy,they are still rocking now days,and I hope to see them again in concert soon."
2,"Not appropriate for children, or anyone else.","The Large and Growly Bear is a muddled disaster of a novel that can't seem to decide if it's a Marxist deconstruction of predator-prey relations or a sort of ecofeminist castration fable. While the ending offers temporary catharsis, in the final analysis this book presents a vision of an amoral universe that is neither compelling nor coherent."
1,Another reprint with a new name,"I have as of now quit buying these ""new"" books until I see a few reviews, having been burned twice now by buying what I think is a new book and getting old books with a new name."
4,Not available in another way on Kindle,"I was happy to buy the last ""two books in one"" Kindle release, because I wanted the books on my Kindle (my paper copies are packed away), and that was the only way to get them. This is the same.I wish the other reviewers would stop whining - the fact that this title contains two books is quite clear, and which ones is also clear."
4,You mean there's another version out there?,This movie was erotically charged almost from the start. The dance club scene with Lisa and the woman in the audience is the stuff fantasies are made of ... Unfortunately it never quite panned out ... or did it. All I know is I'd sure like to get my hands on the unrated version -- if it even exists. Easily one of the better titles from this Playboy series. I just hope it gets released in it's untainted form.
4,This book is one of the best training aides I've used to build OS knowledge,I have used this book as the first book in my training process in development of OS/RTOS knowledge in a co-worker/subordinate. I find it to be complete as a high-level homogeneous reference tool. I will continue to use it for this purpose.
1,Just another crappy shock band,"All these guys get together and say ""lets scream for false reasons to get all the kiddies to buy our album"" These guys are so boring sounding. They look like an ad for addidas. come on people! The last straw was when the lead singer claimed that korn was the first band to combine rap and rock. EXCUSE MEEE!! I believe that run dmc was doing it back in the 80's. On top of that why are all korn's fans such jerks? I'm around a lot of these people and a lot of them I knew well and they are a bunch of sh** heads."
2,Waste of Talent,"Give Korn credit for instigating a war of the clones in their genre- they were indeed one of the firsts. Give them credit for only that, because this album is the same song over and over and over again. No versatility, no variety, one big yawn."
1,"On a par with dixie chicks, hanson & Mariah Carey","This is possibly the worst album too have ever been burnt into polycarbonate. There are two good songs: ""Clown"" and the final track on the album. The rest is drivel. Absolute and complete drivel. I sold this long ago and have been ten bucks the richer. There is no originality whatsoever and better lyrics have been written by anyone with a basic grasp of monosyllabic words. I mean this is terrible, if you buy it you will rue ignoring the truth..."
1,"What can you say about this band? They try so hard, maybe","Quite a catchy intro on ""Blind"" But, believe it or not: that's all there is here. No real potential.The sound is weak and pathetic. And check out that lyrical content range. Songs about fathers raping their sons, homosexuality (although the lead singer is married to a woman), and whatever else you can make out between those huff-n-puffs.You'll run out of breath paying for this album, which is something I recommend you DON'T do! There is obviously a longer future than this for this band (no doubt due to the simple and easily pleased teen market) but there is absolutely no room for growth. And for whatever rumors are circulating about KoRn as a sell-out band? Please! They sold out before they formed."
5,Music that lives in all of us.,"Even if you don't listen to the ""Hard Rock Punks"" as some people have come to call them. We all can relate to KoRn in this soon to be classic self-titled CD. Jonathan Davis' vocals are amazing!! When I First Heard This CD I really found that i could relate to alot of his lyrics. All the songs on this CD are terrific! What are you doin still sitting there! Go Buy This CD!!! If you already have it, buy a copy for your best friend. Go, Go now!!"
1,Ever heard of Helmet?,"Anyone who thinks this stuff was original back in '94 must have been living in a closet for the last 20 years. Korn's debut sounds EXACTLY THE SAME as Helmet's ""Strap It On"". The songwriting is just slightly more polished but the CD never really rocks as hard [as SIO]. But this is just typical of the 90s: the more unoriginal the music the more successful it is."
1,Ignore my previous review!,"This is my third review of this album, so I'll be brief:I managed to start enjoying this album just after my first review (calling it crap). Then I wrote a review saying I liked it. Now I've heard a little band called Machine Head, and I'd like to say: KORN IS FOR PUSSIES!"
3,Hmmm....,"Everyone says this is the best by Korn. Well...that's not the case at all. The beats completely change in the middle of the songs, and just aren't nearly as good as say, ""issues"" or ""Untouchables"". I'm not saying it's not a good CD, it's still good, but it's just overrated. I think it's worth buying, but it's just not on the top of my list."
2,"Korn is pretty bad, but this is their best","Considering Korn is really bad, this is ok. I mean when I first heard them, I thought, ""This is pretty cool."" After a while, they really got stale though. I mean really stale. All of their songs are the same. Then, everybody started liking them, which made it worst. They're a bunch of heavy metal wannabes. If you like stale bands like Limp Bizkit, get this. But if you like real metal, such as Metallica, Anthrax, or Deep Purple, don't get this, or you'll be highly dissapointed."
1,Korn SUCKS,"My title says it all. Anyone who thinks this is metal doesn't know their a#* from a hole in the ground. Listen to real metal like Fear Factory, Slipknot, Soulfly, and Machine Head. Don't buy anything Korn related."
2,This album used to be cool,"This album used to be awesome once upon a time, that is, until I matured. Yup, that's right, I started to really question my music tastes, and I decided to explore, and I found that korn and company just weren't talented at all. You may find that one day too. Sure, this album has it's moments, and there are a lot of bands copying them, but it's just not any good musically. You'd be better off trying some real metal, or grunge."
1,"good, but...","The Get-up kids put out one classic album, that almost anyone can love. I loved it. This is just useless."
2,A decline in talent........,"This cd starts off with the worst song The Get Up Kids have ever written. Oddly enough, this cd shows how The Get Up Kids have gotten significantly worse over time. Since when do unpassionate singing and pianos have a place in rock. (Nobody can call this emo either because it is not) The only reason I would recommend this cd is for the last six songs. Everything else on this cd is a pathetic attempt at giving high school kids some kind of motivation. They will think to themselves, wow, girls don't like me, and one day I will could be able to write terrible sappy songs about it and make loads of money. This cd has absolutely no passion, not to mention intelligence, until the last five songs. People, go buy Four Minute Mile, and understand why the get up kids were good at one point in time."
5,Good Quality,"Wow this review is one year late but I remember it was in pretty good shape and it was so cheap that when i did a buyback on this in my school, I got almost the same amount I payed for this book. GREAT :)"
1,"Interesting thoughts, but a little bit too casual","The title promises firework for your brain, but really doesn't deliver. After 100 pages or so I noticed I was getting bored with it. A lot of examples, but no more thought provoking ideas. If you're interested in exploring new ways for doing business in the future, I can recommend ""The Visionary's Handbook"" by Watts Wacker and Jim Taylor. More thought provoking. The Dream Society is only recommended for casual reading."
3,why the chimes rang,"Great condition but didn't realise the book contained several stories. Just wanted the one story ""Why the chimes rang.""It was bought as a gift and the reciever was totally thrilled"
2,Too Stiff for the Buck,"This is a deceptively, adorable looking shoe & not cheap. I rate it 5 stars for looks and 0 stars for fit.1 - the footbed is too narrow, it's designed for very slim feet!2 - the footbed is slippery so when walking, the foot slides to the front, causing your toes to hang over the edge3 - the shoe is flat with no flexability, therefore walking is restraining, it's not an easy task (wow- what a concept, walking in sandals?! Shame on you Kenneth Cole, why didn't you think of that!)Although these are beautiful looking sandals, I do not recommend them."
4,Great crusing guide for Venezuela,I have used excellent cruising guides by Chris Doyle while sailing in the eastern caribbean. This guide for Venezuela and Bonaire appears to be equally informative. The mini-charts are clear and provide enough guidance without being cluttered. The only reason I did not give the fifth start is that I have not used the guide in the waters for which it is written - perhaps next season.
3,Experienced muscle pain in legs,I bought this brand but is in 100mg form. Initially I took 1 pill per day and after 3 days I start to have muscle pain in my legs. Not sure if it's due the CO Q10 but the pain gone when I stopped for two days. Now I only take one pill every 2-3 days and expericence more energy at work. BTW I'm over 40.
5,Intense cathedral music,"Take a creative man who likes William Blake poetry and put him in front of an organ in a cavernous cathedral and give him full reign and see what results you get. Curious? Oh, yes, and light some candles, lots of candles, and pretend you're in the 19th century...maybe at a witch trial or something (did they still have them in the 1800's?). Be warned. Track nmbr 2 you may want to turn down. I had my volume up pretty high on track nmbr 1 and track nmbr 2 came blaring through.... almost broke my speakers. But I liked it...."
4,Hillary a person to be noted,"Using Clinton's past interviews and comments from her friends and colleagues, Warner details the evolution of the first lady from teenager to college student to lawyer, mother, activist, and politician's wife. Clinton's strong personality and intellect seem to have made her a success in her own right, and appear to be crucial elements in Bill Clinton's rise to the top. From this book it seems Bill would never had been able to become the President; but she would have made at least senator on her own. This book places a positive light on an intelligent Hillary Clinton. And actually shows Bill as a liability. This is worth reading to see how she was when she first entered the limelight of political life."
4,good cd,This is a contemporary Christian Cd of non hymms. Very good music and recording quality and ofcourse Sandi's singing.
1,Looks great initially - but beware!,"My guess is that most of the ""great"" reviews were customers who had just taken it out of the box. I myself would agree that out of the box it is a nice looking piece and exactly what I wanted.Poor design though - the lid does get in the way as the brush is too short and the brush does unscrew from the lid while cleaning. Those things I could overlook.But, beware - this thing rusts like crazy. Not long after I had it the moist environment in the canister had the inside of the handle coated with rust which sprinkled all over my new white toilet as I cleaned it.Today I moved the item to clean the bathroom floor only to find a thick rust ring staining my brand new tile floor - after a few tries I almost have most of the stain gone. Fortunately, my tiles are sort of a red-clay color so the damage may be concealable. I am going to throw this item away! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,"Not Brass, and has pitted and rusted.","I purchased this item in December of 2010. It looked fine new out of the box, but now it is very apparent that the metal is NOT Brass, but some base metal that is brass colored.The finish began showing spots within two months after I received it, and after nine months is is showing rust spots and pitting. The ""brass coating"" at the top of the brush handle is showing the worse amount of rust and spots even though the brush and its handle was cleaned once a week with polish.The bottom of the brush container, once you remove the plastic liner, has a solid coat of rust. I'd clean it, but the bottom might fall off.Very false item description concerning the material, and the entire item is worth less that $7 to $9. I'd give it NO STARS if I could. I replaced it with a white plastic toilet brush and container."
2,messy and difficult,"It is hard to find ice pop molds these days and I was looking for something that would be easy and reusable (no wooden sticks). I got a few different kinds, including these tupperware molds over a month ago.For starters, they are small. They don't stand up strait or secure in the tray. The parts are hard to fit together (sticks are difficult to put in cap/bottoms, and you have to do it when it's full of juice so it is hard not to spill). Worse, even though it's a tight fit and they are crooked, they leek out at the stick when you eat them so you get gooey juice on you.I recommend the ""groovy freezer pop mold"" by Tovolo if you can find them.I wonder if the first reviewer is the person selling tupperware, I can image a baby would make a mess using these."
1,11 ozs is not a pound,a good foot shorter all around had to go to local store and buy another tarp it really was 10x12 and fit perfect was stronger and came with bungee tie downs and it was HALF THE PRICE local tarp was cheaper then return shipping. Would not recommend unless you believe 11 ozs = a pound of coffee
2,******* Spoiler below **************,"Its hard for me to reconcile with all of the positive reviews this game has received. Its true the graphics are amazing, but the rest of the game far less so. After two hours of endless button mashing and tedious game play I had had enough. The only solutiom was to put it back in the box and take it back to the video store. Which brings me to the real point of this review - to recommend renting this game rather than purchasing it."
2,sad dvd,"They focus more on his having diabetes and not his career. I would have liked it more if they showed him playing or discussed his career with the cubs.They touch on his time with the cubs as a player, but I feel spent too much time showing him sitting in a wheelchair waiting to be seen or when his legs were removed.I did not even finish watching it, because it made me sad and uncomfortable. I wanted to see a baseball great who could deal with an ongoing illness and see how his time as a ball player was the strength of his life. Instead I felt I was staring at a guy who while strong, was nearing death and missing his better days. I think it could have been done much much better.You may see it differently. I just was unhappy I spent the money."
5,the best of 2001,"the mayflower is the best album of 2001. I'm coming back is pure pop. i love singing it on karaoke. they dance is hard disco at it's hottest. turn the radio up cheered me up a lot. sunshine music never sounded better. she should'a been mine is the best ballad on the album. it made me cry. think about your ex-girlfriend the next time you play it.some bar by the harbor is a wild ride. welcome home is very inspirational. not what you see is a classic. freddie said is hilarious. not a bad song on the album. the way an album should sound. GOD BLESS YOU, BARRY!"
5,We're with you at the Mayflower,"Barry, Thanks for taking us on this wonderful journey to your New York City. After all the recent events, it is great to take a musical trip to the Mayflower with you. These songs are such a wonderful mix of so many genres that you hear something different every time you listen. Thanks again."
5,More Manilow Magic with HERE AT THEMAYFLOWER,"I have long been a Barry Manilow fan since the early 1970's when he emerged as a standout singer with ""Mandy."" Although I may be a bit prejudced, I love his new CD ""Here At The Mayflower."" What a refreshing album to listen to while my kids are blasting that bass-based jumble of profantity stuff they call music. Manilow's latest cd is a mixture of fun tunes to sing and even dance to, and I especially love the ballads which really stand out as pure Manilow magic. This sentimental journey through the fictional ""Mayflower"" apartment building is wonderful from start to finish. When I first bought the cd, I loved it so much I bought it in to work to listen to it. It's still playing repeatedly throughout my workday, every day, for 9 hours, 2 months later. I don't think I'll ever get tired of listening to it. I'm starting to care about every character in the songs! :o)"
2,Turn The Radio Down,"Although the song Turn Up the Radio is typical Manilow with some energy most of the songs on this CD lack the energy of what made Manilow famous in the seventies.I'm a real Manilow fan but I am disappointed with this CD. At least my collection of Manilow CD's is complete , that's about the only reason for buying this CD"
5,Welcome back Barry!,"I have been a fan of Mr. Manilow for ever. I love his music and the lyrics are to die for. I play his music every day. I was thrilled to hear of his new CD and got it straight away. Well done Barry. My granddaughter and I sing The ""Freddie"" song all the time. It's good to hear from you Barry. Sincerelyyour biggest fan, Jeannette B. Gottshall"
5,Exceptional!,"This new album by Barry Manilow is truly exceptional. It's so good, it's downright surprising. Not that he hasn't always put forth great work, but this album is really above his average. The single ""Turn The Radio Up"" is the best piece of ""feel good pop"" to come along in decades! It's incredible. Another highlight of this album is the final song ""Welcome Home"". It's so beautiful. The addition of jazz star Dave Koz on this CD, makes it even more special."
3,Love Guild Guitars,I found THE GUILD GUITAR BOOK to be an easy read and exciting pictures of early models. What I found lacking was info on models made after 1977. The later history would help in determining quility of current make instruments. All in all to learn the history of Guild Guitars this book offers much.
4,Action Words,I bought this DVD for my grandson who is three years old and was diagnosed with autism when he was two. His sister is four. Both of these children loved watching the video but did not want to repeat watching like with the Bounce videos. I thought the DVD was well put together. I think it was a little slow for these two children. They like music and up tempo music. I still would recommend this video and I just put it on in between their other videos. You cannot get enough variety.
5,Great for language delayed children,"These are simply fantastic tapes ... my 3-yr old son has a language delay/slight autism and within a week he had learned the 30 or so verbs on these tapes. He loves to watch them and even makes a special request for the tapes. He's taken the words he's learned and started using them in everyday life. For the first time he started requesting that we do things for him like ""Smile!"" ""Cry"" and ""Wave"". While they might not work for everyone they have been an amazing tool for us."
1,Lost Interest,"Sorry...but after Maggie's character died in the last Calder installment...I lost interest. I think I cried for about two days after I read ""Calder Born, Calder Bred"" ---but then again, I was only 16. NEway...I skimmed through ""Calder Pride"" this afternoon in the library but I just couldn't bring myself to read about Maggie's family going on without her. It just didn't seem right, somehow. I keep hoping that Janet Dailey will come out with one final Calder book that will bring Chase and Maggie back together again. Only in my dreams, I suppose."
4,Ideal for purpose,I bought this book to read to a group of 8 and 9 year olds about how it might feel to not be able to see. The book was ideal. Great length and kept their interest right until the end. I have other versions of this story but this one suited the age group perfectly.
5,My daughter loves this book,My daughter thinks it is a very good book. she finds it very interesting. she is loving it.Will recommend this book to anyone
2,Urban Action Collection: 4 Film Favorites,"This was not the best as far as ""Black Exploitation"" films go- more a novelty of the past and best looked at to reconnect with former stars and people that are just not on the big screen much anymore. Most of the four films seemed as if they were produced with blindfolds but ""Three The Hard Way"" and even ""Black Sampson"" had some potential."
4,This is a pretty good book,"I bought this book because I have a big interest in Bonnie and Clyde, but I had never even heard of Ralph Faults. This book is easy to read, very well researched, and I enjoyed it tremendously! I even liked learning about Ralph, who was also a criminal in the thirties, but who turned his life around. If you like Bonnie and Clyde (the real deal, not the movie folklore) then I would highly reccomend this book."
4,Chemistry and more,For all you beginers in this course.This is a great book to start with.It helps understand formulas and equations better then ever.A must have!
2,Don't like the teaching style,"I found the constant Q&A method to be an annoying method of learning. I need to learn chemistry in a week to take a CLEP exam, but the Q&A method just slows me down. I would recommend you check out the Homework Helpers Chemistry guide instead."
4,Chemistry - no problem!,"I bought the self-teach book 'Chemistry Concepts & Problems' to help with my preparations for a medical entry exam and it is great! It is filled with questions, questions, questions & more questions (and answers of course!) and is a great overview of Chemistry up to grade 12/first year university. It is very easy to understand and learn from.My only complaint is that immediately under each question is the answer, so you've seen the answer before you can even think about it! Why not put the answers at the back of the book like every other textbook? (This is why I deducted a star). [There are some 'self-tests' which don't have the answers immediately after the question, but I would have preferred no answers until the end, all the way through the book].This aside, I have, and continue to learn a lot with it.If you are looking for an easy to understand chemistry textbook as a refresher or to compliment your current chemistry course - go ahead - it's worth the money."
4,Chemistry we all can understand,"An excellent book for those taking a chemistry course or those who need to be refreshed for an upcoming comprehensive exam. It is straight forward, to the point. This book contains subjects that are most likely to appear on exams. It adds simplicity, if possible, to chemistry. A well deserved investment if you want to improve your grade."
5,"Great layout, easy book to follow","I find this book a very thorough and painfully methodical step-by-step guide. Each concept is presented in a logical sequence and is broken into small pieces so it can be easily learned and absorbed. It has all the characteristics of good teaching: Small fractions of knowledge introduced progressively, frequent repetition, test questions on every other sentence, each piece is based on the previous, logical correlates and a sum-up test at the end of each passage. I don't mind the answers under each question, in fact I prefer it as it gives me instant feedback without having to flip back the pages 4 times a minute. I just hide the answers until I've answered the question. Even my cat could learn chemistry with this book. Brilliant!"
4,An OK Chemistry book but...,"Yep... this only covers 1st semester General Chemistry. It didn't really follow my class well, but it may yours. I found it a rather difficult read and a little more complicated than need be for a 'teach yourself' text.I found Chemistry for Dummies to be much more explanatory, easier to understand, and better.So, this text in combination with Chemistry for Dummies make a good combo... The For Dummies book introduces the concepts so you can understand them, and this book takes you further in depth. But, if you're studying for Chem II, you're outta luck!~BB"
2,Outdated,"Very outdated! Doesn't address wheat/gluten and/or sugar sensitivities. I sent it back and followed the food plan I'm currently on. Still looking for a healthy, weight gain book!"
4,A Good Book~~,"This book may be very helpful to readers who want to learn American Accent!!I'm also learning english as a second language.I realized that the ""Accent"" is very difficult for ESL students but, it is very important for talking.After I purchased this book,I'm studying for myself with the book and CDs.I believe that this book will change me~~I hope I'm good at ""Accent"" through this book^^"
5,The best you can get!,Definitely worth the money! Of course it'll take a lot of time and effort to pick up a new accent. With this book and the audio CD's it will be a piece of cake to make you sound a lot better in less than no time!
5,Big in Japan,"Originally released late 1974, in Japan by Elektra/Warner Pioneer, reissued by Toshiba-EMI. The tour for this LP in Japan gave Queen fan-demonium of Beatlemania-sized proportions!"
5,The beggining of what is now known as Classic Queen,"This is the begging of classic queen, or it's American popularity started here. ""Killer Queen, was there first american Hit, and is one of my favorites. ""Tenement Funster"" and ""Flick of the Wrist"" are also very good. ""Stone Cold Crazy"" is the best on this album, i think Metallica later redid it.All in All, you should get this, it was what put them on the map."
5,Another great Queen Album,"""Killer Queen,"" ""Bring Back That Leroy Brown,"" ""Flick of the Wrist"" are all great Queen tunes. The entire album holds together well after all these years."
3,Buy the Platinum Tools instead,"Wire cutters with the golden ration / nautilus shell / fibonacci / adjustable gear are way better than the ones with the screw adjustment.However, this one has a sliding locking wire on the backside (not shown in the photo) which is rather annoying.If you cut it off it will feel much better, but the handle won't have anything to keep it from springing full open.I'd suggest the Platinum Tools version instead:[...]There must be an error in Amazon's price on that listing though, if you google around you'll find that the Platinum Tools version is as cheap as or cheaper than this Gardner Bender brand everywhere else."
1,a long wait for a terrible album,"if you are going to make a jazzanova investment, get the singles collection. this album is trying hard to be innovative, cool, and in the meanwhile loses all of the musical integrity that jazzanova has gained in the past."
1,soothing,"is quite a bit different than the double-disc remixes done in 2000....quieter and even has a few dead spots. Is somewhat uneven, but has a few standout tracks whether for vocal (check out 1) or just interesting melody."
1,Poorly designed stand,"The slots to insert the swords are only 2"" wide. If you have fantasy swords, they will likely not fit. I will have to use power tools to open up the slots and paint it with india ink to get this display to work for even a single sword. I bought this item through 'cheap humidors"" so I don't know if it would be different through different vendors, but it is the same item from valor 6049. There are 2 connecting pieces between the fans to stabalize them. The tongue and groove slots that are cut into the fan don't mate on 1 side, so only one stabalizer can be installed. The black laquer on the particle board was crushed/dented from shipping as it lay in a pile at the bottom of a cheap box that was held together by packing tape and not much else.Buy a display stand that has adjustable slots to ensure that your swords will fit without the hassle of reengineering this thing from the ground up."
3,Dreamy Music,"Very good CD but I prefer the dance versions of Mariah music better. Sometimes her albums are a bit slow and I wish she would pick up the pace a bit. She is capable. I know she can do it. Anyway, Mariah is pretty awesome...I love her!!!!!"
4,My 2nd Favorite Mariah Carey Album,"Daydream is a fantastic Mariah Carey album to listen to. Although, my first favorite is her namesake, this album still show off her great vocal range and emotion in her songs. I would definitely recommend this album."
1,Another HORRIBLE cd from M. Carey,"Four words: DON'T BUY THIS CD! It's amazing to me how people can actually like this woman's singing and her overly-dramatic songs. Why can't she go back to wear she came from? She is the worst performer out there, always trying to be better than someone else, plus, the woman is concieted! Go figure."
1,terrible...,"In going against the mainstream, I know people will always rip scorn uppon my reviews, but I don't care. I think people who liked this album are the same kind of people who likes MADONNA, MICHAEL JACKSON, SHANA TWAIN, WHITNEY HOUSTON and other media phenomenons around the world. Carey is not a Paul mcCartney, who is a real solo-artist, composer, singer, instrumentist, with an indenpendent mind. Carey has only her stupendous voice, which she is wasting screaming like a banshee intead of singing."
5,Fun AND Educational...WOW,"I've read all the previously written reviews for this incredibleDolly Book and the book delivered all they said it would. I had to take the time to write and say how much fun it was. Yes, it was educational...but it was fun to read with kids. It was funto dress the doll to shop with us. It was fun not having to buythe clothes because they came with the book. It is fun knowing that my grandchildren enjoy reading it with me....and have funreading it alone as well.I am a Grandmother and,like all of us, I want the best for my grandchildren. Soooo..Dolly Goes to the Supermarket is a great start and a perfect addition to any child's library. I look forward to any forthcoming book in this series (I hope it will be a series), and I thank the authors for their creativity,clarity, and humor."
4,oh,I like the voice. Reminds me of Celine too much though. Rene (Mr. Celine Dion) discovered Natasha.
1,"I really wanted to like these, not all babies will","After using Avent (wide nipple) and Dr. Brown's (standard nipple), I found that Dr. Brown's smaller nipple was much better for my baby's tiny mouth. As much as I love Avent bottle's anti-gas design, the nipple was too wide at the base and milk would squirt out of the corner of my baby's mouth constantly. I switched to Dr. Brown's standard nipple which worked great, but I hated washing all those parts. I decided to try this one since the previous reviews rave about decrease in the dribbling of milk, however, this did not work for me. My baby was even messier with this nipple, making loud smacking noises while she sucked and having a constant stream of milk going down her chin, making a mess everywhere.I really wanted to like these because they are cute bottles, but they did not work for my baby."
5,Marvin & Tige - VHS,"This is an excellent movie, very well written, and extremely well acted. It offers lessons about life that both young and old can appreciate. A ""Must Have"" movie for all family libraries."
1,It dosn't work.,"I got this toy for my 14 month old goldendoodle thinking she would love it and play with it all the time. She dosnt even touch the thing. No matter what treat or how much I put in the ball, I would come home and it would be untouched. I was hoping it would be like those dogs on tv pushing it around with their noses but they just dont do that. My dog is very smart and knows just about every trick in the book. If your dog can figure this ball out they are very smart. If anyone has any tips for me on how to get your dog to use this please tell me them. I very much regret buying this product."
2,Losses attention before giving up any treats,"My dog is a basset, a hyper basset. He is always on the go and chewing various toys that we give to him. We baught this toy thinking he would use it alot (bassets are know for their noses) but when it does get his attention it is only for a brief time because no matter how much he rolls it and despite the different treats and amounts we have put into it, nothing comes out. They only come out some of the time when we try to do it ourselves.Unless your dog goes for a while without enforcement, this toy is not for your dog.I only wish we could return it.Hope this helps."
1,they destroyed it,"I filled it with kibble and our dogs got working on rolling it around. I walked away for 30 seconds. I came back and there was a hole in it. My dogs get feeder toys all the time, and they are quite good at using them but this was so easy to tear apart our doberman went for the path of least resistance. It happened so incredibly fast. Just one purposeful bite.If your dog isn't a big chewer, maybe it would be great. Or maybe for a small dog who couldn't get a good bite on a toy this large. I liked that it was soft, so it didn't make loud noises when it hit the walls. Too bad it didn't last one whole day."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Maybe I have an unrealistic expectations, but I expect dog toys to last longer than 10 minutes. My 4-year-old Jack Russell pawed it around and understood the treat comes out the bottom part but didn't want to waste time and went right for it. What a waste of money!"
3,Brownie does not like it,"This ball has some sort of sweet smell that I can't put my finger on.... My dog didnt want it at all so it's just sitting there, so I'll probably end up donating it. He has the IQ ball and a kong which he loves."
2,Opening Too Large,"This is not for heavy chewers, but we liked it so much that every time Zoe would chew through one, we'd buy another. We would put her food in it and while it dispensed slowly, it gave us time to get other things done, as she ate. Now the hole is larger, so her food just falls out. We are greatly disappointed and trying other products now.Omega Paw TTLG6 Tricky Treat Ball- Large"
3,Fantastic concept but what possessed them to give it such a strong scent,"I had to soak this for days to minimise the incredibly strong floral smell (they scented the plastic). It still has traces, but at least the cat can now smell the treats. The design is excellent - the lip inside ensures that the treats don't just fall out. Kept him busy for hours."
1,Don't bother,"Neither dog even gave it the time of day, even when filled with treats. Then after shaking it for 10 mins trying to get the treats out they wouldn't even eat the treats...It has such a strong scent that it masks the scent of the treat and stays on the treats afterward..."
3,"Fun, but could have a better design","I got this on a recommendation from a friend who said it's the only thing her dog plays with. My dog plays with it for a little bit, but soon gets bored because her food gets stuck in there and even I have a hard time shaking it out."
2,Not for heavy chewers,"Our medium-sized (45 pound) terrier tore this into bits in about 15-20 minutes. This might be a fine toy for smaller or older dogs, but I wouldn't recommend it for a strong chewer."
5,Perfect Toy,"This is the best toy for my very busy Brittany, Sadie. It holds a full portion of her dinner kibble and was easy for her to learn. It's large enough that it doesn't get stuck under most furniture. Plus, all of the indentations on the surface make it easy for her to pick it up when she needs to change directions. Since she's a ""super chewer"" it has an extra hole near the opening but otherwise is sturdy. I'm looking forward to having this for a long, long time."
5,Great toy and feeding tool!,"We bought this for our one year old eskimo/pomeranian,Dodger. He loves it. He has other toys and bones which we encourage him to chew, so chewing on the ball hasn't been an issue. He loves nosing and kicking this ball around like a soccer ball! Normally he turns up his nose a bit at his dry food (he likes to hold out for his training treats), but for some reason, having the food fall out of a ball as a result of something he does makes it really exciting. It was a good buy for us!"
5,best money ever spent on toy,This ball may smmell bit like plastic but it keeps my dog occupied and its easy to play with. He figured out that you had to roll the ball for the food to come out after half an hour.
3,Pros and Cons,"I prefer this food distribution toy because its a soft, quiet rubber as opposed to other toys out there that are plastic and LOUD on the floor or when they bang in to the wall. The downside is the rubber rips pretty easily, and therefore its not really durable and would be AWFUL for a chew-y dog."
4,"Not for chewers, but fun toy","My dog loves this toy and it keeps him very entertained. Its challenging which is exactly what he needed. However, he is a chewer and learned that it is easier to get the food out buy chewing through the plastic. I now give it to him for a brief amount of time and take it away before he begins to chew chunks of plastic off. Its a great toy I only wish they had one durable for heavy chewers."
5,"Yes, even an old dog can learn this new trick!","Our dogs, both 11 years old, seemed like they needed some exercise since they're in the house a lot due to the cold winter. I'd seen a friend's puppy use one of these treat balls, so thought I'd give it a try for our dogs. I was thinking our Pomeranian would play with it but he doesn't pay much attention to it. Our sort of lazy Boston Terrier, on the other hand, has really taken to it! She moves it around with her foot and has mastered getting kibbles to come out, and now that's her favorite way to eat! She doesn't care much for eating out of her dishes now! I think it's going to get her some much needed exercise."
5,My Aussie Just Loves This Ball,"When we got this he was not to sure about this, he is very food motivated so as little kibble started falling out. He figured it out pretty fast. Roll the ball get the food. He sleeps in his kennel in our room at night so ever night we fill up the ball and he rolls it all over the place for about 30 minutes. It keeps him occupied big time. I would recommend this to anyone."
1,Max'z Mom,"Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball, LargeHad the original Tricky Treat Ball and it lasted 6 1/2 years. When it finally gave out ordered this one, the newest, and it lasted about 1 hour. Not made of the same strong rubber, whole too big, my dog got his bottom jaw stuck in it. Threw it out within 2 hours of arriving."
2,"Great for treats but if your dog likes to chew, he will chew it up!!","I bought the ball to slow down my pound puppy's ravenous appetite. I love the ball for feeding as it does stop rolling with the indents in the ball and limits the amount dispersed, but it IS NOT CHEW PROOF. My yellow lab loves to knock it around and get the food out, but when the food doesn't come out, she chews at it and now it has much larger holes in it and the food comes out easily. I would like a ""More chew proof "" toy. It lasted about 2 weeks before she figured out to chew it apart and the food comes out. Would like a ball that lasts longer than this one."
3,"A fun toy for fetch, but treats come out without much difficulty","We have a smart little pup, and this toy presents almost no challenge to her when it comes to obtaining the food inside. It diligently dispenses its innards with the slightest toss and tussle.It's a fun ball to play fetch with and lasts a lot longer than tennis balls against chewing, so from that perspective, it's a good toy."
1,Didn't last 5 Min!,I was VERY disappointed! My 1 year old pup had this toy destroyed within 5 minutes! Would not recommend for a chewer!
1,Don't waste your money...,"I bought this for my collie along with 5 other toys. He loves just about everything, but won't touch this. As another reviewer mentioned, it has a very strong plastic smell that is overpowering. Even with the treats in it it smells like plastic. Then, after a few days the treats began to turn rancid and really stink. There is no way to get the treats out or clean it. I tried everything short of drilling a hole in it. I do not see how anyone could give this anything more than a three. This was a waste of money."
5,Slowing Down a FAST eater,"Our yellow lab, Honey, scarfs her food down so fast! In order to slow her down, we purchased one of these treat balls size large. I place about 2/3 of a cup of kibble in the ball and she just pushes it around and eats what falls out. Now that she is no longer eating puppy food, the kibble is larger and so I purchased a second ball. 1/3rd of her meal goes in the pan and 1/3 in each ball. She comes over for the ball and yesterday took the second ball off the counter. After she is done she goes back over her trail to find more fallen kibble. Honey just loves this fun way to eat, and we love the way it slows her down. The ball is durable and once she is done, I take it up so that it is not available for her to chew on later in the day."
1,Complete Waste of Money,My standard poodles chewed through this flimsy thing in about 20 minutes. I wish I could have my money back!
4,Love it but hard to get treats out.,"Even though this ball doesn't feel very tough, none of my dogs have tried to chew it. I alternate treat balls for them, and my aussie/lab, husky and sheltie all love this ball. No one cares about chewing it at all. They do enjoy that it's soft enough to pull out from under furniture and carry to the middle of the room.It's SO HARD to get the last few pieces of food out though! My poor dogs all get so fed up with me trying to shake out the last few bits. Otherwise it's a great ball that I sometimes wish I had more of on mornings that I don't feel like hearing the other, noisier treat balls crashing into stuff. I just love how quiet it is!!I can't recommend this ball if your dog is the type who'd rather chew through the ball than play with it proper, but all three of my very different sized dogs are very gentle with it."
4,"It's great, but one problem","My one dog loved this treat dispenser, and it was sturdy. She did not chew on it, but simply rolled it around to get the treats. Perhaps it is too big for her to chew on it (she's a sheltie), but she will pick it up and carry it a short distance. It does not dispense treats as easily as some other models, because it has an inner rim around the opening in the ball. This leads to my problem...I would give it a 5 star, but I have one problem. I put some slightly bigger treats in it, and one did not get out. It's an inside toy, but she carried it outside and it rained. Water got in the ball, and no matter how I shook it, some water remained in the ball because of the rim around the inside. Could not the treat out either, and you guessed it! Now it smells. Someone mentioned using a dishwasher, but would not some water remain inside because of the rim?Any solution to this problem?"
3,great side support,"cup isn't that great-kinda torpedoes your boobs. However, this had enough hooks and the sides were wide enough to actually hold you in in the back and sides which some bras fail to do. Then again, the cup? Why seams? Why torpedoes-really?"
3,Needs longer shoulder straps.,"This bra is somewhat more comfortable than the ones I replaced with it. BUT! I only give it 3 stars because the shoulder straps are too short so it holds my boobs way too high. And shapes them unnaturally and makes me look malformed. I guess it is trying to make my breasts look perky but at a cup size I or J (depending on bra style and brand) that is not at all possible. Also the seam on the cups won't smooth out and shows through everything I wear. Unless I wear something with a pattern or something else on front to hide them. So no wearing solid tops or tees. I know I have very large breasts but it is beyond ridiculous and frustrating trying to find a bra that fits, is comfortable and is also affordable. I have not yet found a store that carries my cup size so I have spent quite a lot of money on buying and shipping bras that don't fit and/or are not comfortable."
2,Same screen issues as others,"This unit is great, but until the screen becomes easier to rotate and falls down. We have 2 of them, one was in a used car we bought, the other was the first one we had. I am on chat with Sony right now, and have an appt to take it in for repair AGAIN at Circuit City, this is the 3rd time. The first unit we had, the screen got looser and looser and then fell down, hanging by wires. The one in the used car has just done the same. This was a gift from grandpa...maybe to get us to take the kids to visit more, he lived 8 hour away, and he bought a warranty that will expire in 2009...I am telling Sony NEVER again will I buy one. BUT, other than this issue, it does work well, you can even hook up video games to it to play!AND now all Sony is telling me is to take it to be repaired...no DUH!! I am so mad!!"
4,The Relationship Handbook,"This book offers practical insights into how to better navigate the sometimes turbulent waters of human relationships, especially man/woman relationships. Especially insightful was the chapter that covered moods and how to react to the ever-changing moods that sometimes control our lives. I would welcome more application advice on dismissing negative or harmful thoughts and thought patterns. Overall, this quick read was well worth the time and cost."
4,"Shortened from original, but good for toddlers","This is a great book to read to toddlers. Fox in Socks is a masterpiece of linguistic fun.However, this printing is not the whole book. The storyline conflict between Knox and the Fox has been removed, as have many other small pieces, e.g. ""If sir, you sir, choose to chew sir, with the goo goose, chew sir, do sir!"" (I read the full version to my older children a lot!)Having said that, the pages are cardboard, so toddlers can't accidentally rip them, and there won't be any toddler concern about why Knox is mad at the Fox.So, for toddlers, pick this up now, and get the ""full"" version when they're a bit older."
2,A lot of writing,There were many writings on different pages with a pen. Underlining words so dark you can barely understandwhat the word is. Alot of the answers are already done(questionaires). I'm unable to erase the markings. I wish I knew specificallywhat was on this book before I bought it.
5,The best romance novel I've ever read!,I absolutely love this book. I couldn't put it down after the first chapter. I wish I had a guy who would treat me as well as Carter King!
5,A BIG TOAST FOR THE GLASS SLIPPER!!!,"Ms. McLean is a phenomenal writer!!! When I finished reading the book, I flipped back to the beginning to find names of other books that she had written, but, alas, this was her debut novel. What a talent she is. You will not be disappointed in Monica...she is going to be the next Nora Roberts...""mark my Words."" Carter was an exceptional Prince Charming!! Thanks a million, Monica!!!"
3,Delta left tilt contractors saw? do they really exist?,"One previous review mentioned that the Delta Contractor saw is a ""left tilt"" saw. This is not the case as my old contractor saw (model 34-444, 10yrs. old) is in fact a right tilt saw. I found out the hard way after ordering a Delta left tilt cabinet saw thinking it was going to be the same as my contractor saw. After opening the crate box I discovered low and behold that the left tilt that I ordered was not the same as my contractors saw's tilt. It will take some getting use to but I'll live with it and from here on I won't really believe all the reviews that are posted. Just thought I should mention this to alert other potential Delta cabinet saw buyers. Before I ordered my saw I asked Delta what the real difference was. They simply stated personal preferance.The saw went together pretty fast with the biesemeyer fence and extension table. Very happy with it's quality and performance, which I will be appreciating for days to come."
4,Highly Recommend,"I highly recommend this product.It works best for me when taken in larger than prescribed doses. If I take 2- nothing. If I take 2 then take a 3rd- nothing. However, 3 seems to be the magic number, and for a mild insomniac, I am pleased.If I take this product continuously for a few days, I feel a little depressed. Melatonin overdose I am told. I prefer this product to Tylenol which leaves me feeling wasted the next day.I am about to buy more."
4,OK priced,"Good selection of cable ties, very handy to have these around the house for quick repairs.Great for organizing my computer cables and the assortment of cables connecting my TV, cable box, and blu ray playerI was disappointed to find a larger variety pack at a local hardware store priced lower though...that is why i gave it 4 stars"
2,not as good as the second,My kids LOVED the second book in this series (tell me a scary story too) this one they lost interest in about 2 minutes. great co. who sent it though.
2,Preview before buying,"I will start with the positive: The CD reading is great. Mr.Reiner asking whether he should read on is really cute and engaging. My 4 year old son loved it. The illustrations are great.That being said...There are more than enough scary halloween stories that don't deal with young children being tempted into a creepy mans basement. After each page I kept saing things like ""now if a creepy neighbor invites you somewhere do you go? "" I think the one thing that would have made the book better is if the neighbor wasn't a person and was maybe a goblin.I would suggest borrowing this from the library so you can preview before buying it and maybe an older age range would suit the book."
2,We teach our kids NOT to go inside a stranger's house ....,"I was unsettled reading this book -- regarding the reference in which the young boy enters a (very) stange man's house, and is pulled down the basement stairs into his ""evil lair"", if you will.Loved the quality of the illustrations -- but, being a mother of young children, and visually seeing a boy being pulled down into a basement by this strange man, was much too unsettling for me! We all teach our children to avoid stangers at all cost .. this book just encourages it."
3,Not what I expected,"My granddaughter is constantly asking me to tell her a scary story, so I thought this book would do some of the work for me. Unfortunately, she didn't think it was very scary and I'm still making up stories."
2,"Sorry, it's truly weak, NOT a good Queen album","Queen has put out some true classics. THIS one, however, ain't one of those. Repeated listenings will certainly prove that, as I really wanted to like this album.It's a fair well-thought out opinion--seems you can tell which reviews here are honest and unbiased...and question the merits of those that TYPE LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME. ugh. This is a fair album, period."
1,"Retread, retread, retread","At one time, I was a devoted fan of this series, but no longer. It has become so entirely predictable, you are not sure which book you are reading--there is no great difference from the last one. Amelia and Emerson are in danger of becoming cliches; Nefret and Rasmes, who were fascinating children, have become dullsville adults; I wish to God somebody would bury Sethos. The only bright spot is Sennia. If you want more of the same, then this is your meat; but consider. Amelia and Emerson go to Egypt; they dig for antiquities; there is a younger couple to provide the romantic subplot; they are in danger from thiefs/murderers/terrorists; someone is kidnapped; someone escapes; all ends happily. The end. The humour helps, but not enough. I'm getting so that when someone attacks Amelia, I hope they'll do a lot of damage. A bad sign."
1,"I was ""Bored of the Silent""","I feel I must protect other unwitting prospective readers from this directionless, suspenseless, bore. Being a fan of all things Egypt and an Agatha Christie fan as well I thought this book would be sure to please---not so! Short of Grisham I've never read about heroic characters so impossibly beautiful, charming, intelligent, desirable, and perfect in any way and SO boring. Was this a mystery? I don't remember much of a plot at all. Just characters going from one place to another and getting engaged in conflictless conflicts. Finally, why set it in Egypt if you intend to use next to nothing of the country, its people (other than a few trite stereotypes), and its antiquities?Reading it on a long plane flight, I actually pondered whether finishing the book or crashing would be preferable. For my guilty pleasure I'll go back to Stephen King---Tolstoy by comparison."
2,Whatever happened to Amelia ?,"This is the first Peabody novel I was disappointed in,especially after it's jammed packed predecessor He Shall Thunder in the Sky. The story lacked most of the exciting touches that make the Peabody series great. I'd rather wait awhile longer for a great story then waste time and money on a mediocre one."
4,not the best but still well done!,"Elizabeth Peters has created an entire world, full of clever characters, great relationships, and well-thought out plot lines. She's having a bit of trouble keeping them all afloat, and this plot was rather thin, but the book was still entertaining- and satisfying to those interested in the family's goings on and ""happy endings.""Finally, the family decides to confide in each other a bit more- their obtuseness reached a frustrating fever pitch in ""Thunder"". I would wish that MPM keeps with the basic morality of previous books- be Peters, not Michaels. Nefret and Ramses are shaping up quite nicely, and Miss Minton and her friend shouldn't just end up in an on-again, off-again shacking up situation, which wouldn't be true to the series' basic feel.I also would like to see the interracial romance started in this one bloom, as well. I hope Peters keeps them coming for a long time."
5,Cable ties!!,"They are cable ties!! Used them to organize the cables in my PC. Very long, but can cut unneeded parts. They hold cables very well.Product shipped very quickly."
4,Gardener Bender GK-15,The quality of this product was much better than I expected for the price. The crimping tool is as good as the more expensive Belden brand. The quality of the crimping pieces is very good. The connector sheath stays on the crimping sleeve after crimping which is usually not the case with cheap connectors. I gave it 4 Stars because nothing is perfect.
5,good nice and or fun,this is a punk band with a hillbilly twist ...... but dont buy it if you hate freaks.
5,"AWESOME, AWESOME, ...",WOW! The best war movie yet! Finally a war movie with no romance! No offence to anyone but I don't like romance in these particular movies and this is coming from a girl! Awesome movie. Josh Hartnett was astonishing! Along with the whole cast and crew! I wish Blackburn(Orlnado Bloom) never got hurt***
5,A GREAT BIG MOVIE!,"... it was the most realistic and true movie made in the recent decade.I think this is on par with the epic movies like ""Lawrence of Arabia"",""Khartoum"" and ""Platoon""."
3,"Not the greatest movie I've ever seen, but good.","Very realistic battle sequences, a lot of blood and gore. But I found the movie sort of dry. There was a lot of swearing (understandably) and all of the actors gave good performances. I would recommend it to war-movie lovers, although it's not as good as some."
3,Good movie,"I enjoyed this movie, but I think if it wouldn't have been a true story I would have been bored with it. I usually enjoy true stories more."
2,Could have been made better,"I feel sad everytime I watch a war movie - blood splattered across pavements, body parts blown everywhere, too much profanity. War & death basically leave me a heavy heart to reckon with. That partially explains my 2-star rating --- I basically don't feel comfortable with war movies.However, there's one particular war movie that I like & that is ""Saving Private Ryan"". There is a core group of soldiers, whose lives, beliefs & fates I managed to follow through. I guess that is what was lacking in Black Hawk Down. There were just too many characters, a lot of action but inadequate room for character development. I relied heavily on their faces to tie in with the characters they portrayed, but when they were all bloodied & grimed, & not enough stuff to make them stand out, I just got them all mixed up.I feel like it was just a collection of big names with hit movies to back them up, but nothing essential to mark their contribution in this particular film."
5,Great action movie.,"This movie was non-stop action from the moment it began to the moment it ended. I walked out of the theatre with an adrenalin rush. Just like Saving Private Ryan showed the Rangers of WWII, this movie shows the Rangers of today. It also shows two other top-notch special operations groups: 160th SOAR (basically, the best military helicopter pilots in the world) and Delta (a small group of covert, fast-attacking, grade-A marksmen). This movie does a great job at showing the comradery that these warriors share and gives some much earned respect to these men for the service they provide. ""Nightstalkers don't quit!"" ""Rangers lead the way!"""
1,Disturbing,"This movie was a very real depiction of a war-time situation. In that, this was a well done movie. For the viewer, however, I found the movie too intense. There was little time for a person to recover from each sceen and absorb the information introduced. By the end of the movie, instead of reflecting on the movie, I just wanted to give my senses a break and not think about anything for a while."
3,"Great movie, but where are the DVD special features?","I loved the movie (and the book), but if you're buying the DVD expecting any special features, think again. They didn't even bother to include the trailer! Sure the box says ""theatrical trailer(s)"", but those are two trailers for other movies! There's a 10 minute behind-the-scenes bit, but it's really just a quick character introduction by the actors -- pretty useless if you've already seen the movie and paid any attention to the characters. Audio options, etc. are minimal. Some work went into the menu screens, but they suffer from what many DVD menus suffer from: slow menu navigation due to animations during transitions from one screen to the next. It was nice to watch the first time but has just been infuriatingly slow ever since. I'm glad to own the movie, but the DVD is disappointing. I'm wondering if I should have waited for a ""Special Edition"". Maybe they're withholding the features for a later release to cash in a second time..."
2,"Good action, but boring movie","This movie lived up to the hype of best sound and it had some great action sequences. but i turned it off about 3/4 through it because it just didn't hold my attention. same thing over and over and over, without actually going into why that happened.all in all, boring movie."
1,If i could offer a rating lower....,"People that view such blatantly jingoistic codswollop as entertainment are truly misguided. Is a thoroughly biased and unapologetic representation of the ugliness of conflict (especially on a continent like Africa) what could be considered a 'popcorn' film? Some might call it propaganda, especially considering the geopolitical (and socioeconomic) status of the world at present. Utter filth. Read up on a few alternate sources of history, open your eye's instead of watching something so easy to imbibe from the comfort of your armchair. Please. THE REPRESENTATION OF SUCH EVENTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED ENTERTAINMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!"
2,Warning,"The 2 stars aren't for the movie, which I think was fantastic. The 2 stars are for the DVD. Clearly, they spent no time on this DVD. There are no delted scenes, funny outtakes, in-depth featurettes, etc. This makes me mad, because I think I know what's going to happen- a future DVD release packed with extras. It's happened with Memento, Men in Black, and others.Some of my friends don't understand the fuss over the extras, preferring instead to just watch the movie. That's fine, but I'm not shelling out [$$$] just for the movie. If the movie was all I wanted, I'd buy the VHS, because frankly the improvement in picture quality isn't anything to scream about. IF you're looking for a DVD along the lines of Star Wars: Phantom Menace or some of the Criterion DVDs, I'd wait until you're sure that they're not releasing a better Blackhawk Down in the future."
3,"Good DVD, but characters were stereotypes","I agree with the previous reviews that complement the way BHD depicts the chaos of war, and especially the camaraderie and dedication of the soldiers to their fellow Rangers, etc.My one complaint is with the main characters. Except for Grimes, all were stereotypes. You have the two southern stereotypes - the God-fearing duty-driven Captain and Hoot, the bad-...no-nonsense fighter. There was no subtlety about either of these characters at all, but I guess Hollywood has always done that with southerners.Ditto for Josh Hartnett's ""nice guy who wants to save the world but finds himself in over his head"" character. The only thing they left out was which town in California he was from.A well-made movie that could have benefited from better developed characters."
3,"Dodges the big questions, but it still has a heart","Once again, Ridley Scott delivers a visual spectacle with enough gritty realism to please even the most dogged fans of the genre. Aiming to please a mass audience, this film wisely dodges the politics of America's involvement in Somalia, and focuses instead on the human toll (well, the American body count, at least). This will certainly irk viewers who would have preferred a more balanced rendering. But what can we really expect? This isn't an evening with Noam Chomsky, it's a Jerry Bruckheimer production. And in the end, the resolute focus on ""our boys"" kind of works. Sure, the main attractions here are still visual, but what you take away from this movie is quite a bit more than Jerry's films usually offer: a sense that war is awful, terrifying and quite often completely pointless and yet, when thrown into it, ordinary guys can be mightily heroic. That's something worth saying - even if we don't want to think too closely about how they got there."
3,$ave Your Money...,"Great movie, but there'll be a special edition DVD with more features early 2003. Save your money for that DVD instead of this one."
4,Best war movies,This film is so much action from beginning to an end i'll recommend this for all who loved watching action adventure film . The way how they did the shooting is so realistic
4,"STARTLING, DISTURBING","Slice of war lacks a particular political point of view and instead mirrors back the American public's indifference to involvement in foreign affairs. The film is partly propagandic in painting a simple crude picture of the enemy seizing all food-care shipments from whom they perceive as their enemy. There is just not enough evidence presented to support the risk imposed in sending military special forces into Mogadishu to contain ( kidnap? kill? ) Somali dictator Muhammad Farrah Aidid. Regardless, the movie is a harrowing depiction of men in military conflict, extremely well filmed and very sad. I'm disturbed to see our American troops immortalized in this way and ""Black Hawk Down"" forces us to contemplate our military actions."
1,Nice Movie - Too bad it isn't true to life.,"Nice action and acting all around, but this is not what happened in real life people. Read the book by Mark Bowden - one of the survivors. Find out why he and others are no longer with the military."
3,Just doesnt capture reality!!,"Black Hawk Down is not an awe-inspiring movie, as the title indicates.Overall, its confusing. The fighting is random and most of the events shown in the movie never really happend. Amazingly, the ending was so abrupt. The American Forces retreated and this was not actually shown in the movie. International assistance such as the Pakistani support for the U.S was extremely eppigrammatic in the movie, amid the fact that it wasnt."
4,Very Good but Not in Same Class as My Top 2 War Films,"This is a gut wrenching, true American war film about our war efforts in Somalia which mirror pretty closely what is going on in Afghanistan today. As a war film, it totally succeeds. However, my top 2 such films are ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Platoon"" and I can't put this on the same level as those. Those two managed to transcend the war genre, taking the genre to a whole new plateau. ""Apocalypse Now"" rendered a wholly artistic, surreal version of war whereas ""Platoon"" presented war from a ""you are there at grunt level"" point of view. Also, the sheer acting ability in those 2 films eclipse all other war performances. But Ridley Scott knows how to make an action movie and does so here. If you are a war afficiando you will love it."
4,Great movie for DVD but . . .,"I thought that this was a great movie when I saw it in the theatre and I could not wait for it to be released on DVD for all the extra features that usually come with a DVD. After I purchased the DVD I found myself dissapointed with the lack of extra features that I guess I expected. The back or the DVD case says that the movie trailers are included. The only trailers I have on my copy are for Spiderman and The One. I was also hoping for some deleted scenes. I hope this is not a trend to release a DVD with limited special features and then in six months re-release it as a ""Special Edition"" with all the extras!"
4,Good movie,This is a good movie and it tries to give us a good perspective of what the experience was like. I am not sure how much is acurate with the story but I do know it was a great film
4,Lots of dark scenes,"I think that the prevalent dark scenes caused this movie to be less likeable. Thataside, I still rate this to be very good."
2,"Good fighting that undermines the ""plot""","This is ultimately another Hollywood film whether or not the director intended it to be. It has little character development (if any) and doesn't really tell the story (beyond fighting which we already essentially knew). If you're looking for blood and guts alone, you're in for a ride. If you're looking for another Saving Private Ryan with character development and more than just fighting (with violence as a byproduct) then look elsewhere.This is a very one-sided film. Corrupted politics (also existent in the 'good sided' US) somehow translates into purely evil somalians that do nothing but kill (innocents and american soldiers alike).So, you will get to see the omnipotent americans kill those black hawk suckers alright (no pun intended...), but not much else. That's Hollywood for you."
1,Not much to say,"This is quite possibly the worst thing I have ever seen commited to celluloid. This will be buried in a time capsule labeled ""things George W. Bush did to our mental well being""."
1,I'd give it zero stars were that possible.,"Summary of the movie:>>>Bo-da-da bo-da-da blau blau blau! ""We're down."" Bo-da-da bo-da-da blau blau blau! ""We're being over-run!""<<<That's it! Repeat the above seven-thousand times and you have the whole move. No need to waste any time watching it."
5,One humble opinion,"This is definitely one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. You are pulled directly into the mind, heart and soul of the brave Rangers that were mired in this 18 hour 'war'. I wanted to jump from my seat and run to the aid of the wounded, get beside the courageous and pray for the dead.How can I ever repay what these young men have done and continue to do for me as a citizen of this great nation? What will my contribution be?I left the theater feeling unworthy of the men that fought so bravely. I know what happened in Mogadishu. I felt what happened in Mogadishu. Thank you Ridley Scott."
1,What's the bloody point?,"There are war movies I would like to watch again, such as Pearl Habor. But I definitely do not want to watch this movie the second time. It taxed my patience even during the first viewing. For it is very poorly conceived as a movie: no characterization, no plot, no structure. As such, it is terribly boring. All one gets to see, for more than two hours, is brutality, blood, violence. Josh Hartnett is a talented actor, but he does not even have a chance to show his talent, for, like war itself, this movie does not allow people to emerge as individuals, and this hurts the point of the movie, which is ""fighting for the man next to you."" Great war movies do not just exhibit shooting, bombing, running and shouting. They show the audience who the soldiers are--not as machines, but as individuals, as human beings. This movie fails to do that, and for this reason, it fails to be moving."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought these to hold wire mesh cubes together. Almost every single cable tie broke, either right when threaded or as I was pulling it tight. I was not threading it incorrectly nor was I using too much force, but they would snap and shatter like nobody's business. I needed 12 ties, so I thought the pack of 100 was overkill - but when all was said and done, I wound up with 10 that hadn't snapped, and filled in the rest with smaller, non-UVB resistant ties. These are absolute garbage. Do not waste your money or your time on them."
1,I watched the movie in english: ) (didn't like it much),"Playing Beatie Bow is a fantasy tale set in the rocks aera of sydney town 1873 & sydney in the 80's. The main charactor, Abigal Kirk (Imogen Annesley) babysits a young girl called Samantha. She points out a ghostly looking girl out to Abigal when playing a game called ""Beatie Bow"". Abibal chases her & when she touches her she is thrown back in time, & an amazing love story unfolds."
3,A fair book,"This book is OK, if you like it i reccomend the book Time For Andrew!You'll like it even better!"
3,goodbook,The book arrived promptly and in good order and condition. I am pleased to recommend this method of buying books as I have purchased here before and am satisfied with the service.
5,Breakthrough documentary about southern gay life,"Amazingly well-done first film by young documentarian, Jonathan Crawford. He captures the sleepy character of Conway, Arkansas, punctuated by the hostility and prejudice shown to a pair of middle-aged gay men---long-time partners, who want to marry."
2,sloppy info,"If it weren't for the outrageous amount of typos in the examples presented in this book I might not give this book a bad review. It's relatively quick reading, not a bad book if your looking for something to familiarize yourself with HTML and Javascript enough to have a base of reference and to get started. However the code examples seem not to have been proofread. For example on page 139 the example for an anchor that this is repeated in each example on the page, 6 times!On the next don't care if these guys don't know how to spell present, but I feel that 6 incorrect closing tags on one page should have been noticed! This book is consistently sloppy. I'm a little shocked this was allowed to go the press the way it is. The graphic design is a bit hard on the eyes, too."
5,A Must-Own Slice of History,"I will never forget sitting down to watch this event live with my family on September 21. The DVD captures all the raw emotion, talent, and sincerety of the night. All grandstanding, egos and attitudes were checked at the door. What's left is an entertainment experience that will bring a lump to your throat, a tear to your eyes, and a smile to your face. In the end, you will be left with a heart that is swelled with pride and a renewed gratitude toward the U.S.A. This is an important piece of history that you need to share with your family and friends."
4,cute shoes,"the shoes looks nice, and beutifull but the sole so slipeery... :(the sinze fits bit bigger"
5,Great recumbent bike!,"I've had my bike for about 1 month now and just love it. My husband and I found it easy to assemble and did so in less than an hour. It's so quiet that I can even talk on the phone while riding it. It also adjusts easily for my short legs or for my husband who's taller. I really like the fact that it doesn't take up much room, unlike the more expensive models. Overall I would have to say that this bike is well worth the money and I highly recommend it."
4,I'm very happy with this bike,"this bike has worked better than i have expected. it's smooth and doesn't make much noise, also it doesn't take up too much space. you do have to make sure to tighten the bolts on the seat to keep it from rocking and adjusting the seat is a little annoying since it's connected bar on the floor. all around it's a great buy under for under 200. i just wish it had a heart rate monitor."
3,great bike,"this bike is great,i lost about 10 pounds in 2 weeks with a 20 min a day workout..this is a great item..."
2,Did I get the same bike the rest of you did?,"I recieved this bike today. Easy to put together (about 20 minutes tops) A lot of the brakets didn't line up perfect... The first thing that was dissapointing was that one of the bolts holding the seat on stripped out with hardly any force. The second was the seat itself. I can hear the wood cracking on one side and I weigh 220lbs... the biggest disapointment is the thing they call a ""computer"" this thing is a joke. It's supposed to start up when you begin but doesnt come on till you are off the bike thinking its busted. As far as the readouts, God knows what your looking at cause as soon as you can read the number being displayed it automaticly changes to something else. Overall, it feels cheaply made and I am debating on shipping this turd back. The only good thing I can say about it is that it is very quiet..."
5,As great as previous reviews state,"I had my heart set on Calphalon but after finding this set and reading the reviews I ordered them. I love them. Very high quality and cook great. Watch Amazon's pricing. Sometimes it's $129.99 on Mondays, sometimes $159.99, and today it's over $200. I will update my review after we've used them awhile to state if they're holding up well.** Update - We've had them 3 months, still love them. The only minor complaint I have is the outside is very hard to clean if it blackens. Otherwise, they cook great, nothing sticks, their strong. Would buy again in a heartbeat."
1,Produc never shipped,"I did buy this product knowing it was available for shipping and I do not understand your delay, this preendet makes me think you are not as serius as I think."
4,Awesome basic set!,"I loved this set! I bought it about 3 - 4 years ago and still use it. Like another reviewer mentioned - I love the lids, they sit well (no gaps, etc) and they're durable. Also, the handles are great. They don't get hot at all. And I love how you can put the saucepans in the oven! The pots are heavy, which means they are thick, and therefore take some time in heating up. I prefer it that way though, so that when I remove it from heat, the pot stays hot a good long time after.The bottom finish of the pots are still in great shape after a couple of years of use, but the two frying pans show some wear and the finish at the bottom is wearing away; it looks scrathed up and I have to oil them well to keep things from sticking. But they show the most wear because I use them the most. I contacted KitchenAid and they said they would replace them if I sent them in. All in all, a good set."
5,Wonderful,"I'll never forget the scene where a 10-year-old character named Brain (not Brian as I read for 10 or so pages) details to Edgar the horrible atrocities Apache indians perform on their enemies in warfare. Edgar, laying in bed in the youth's room, responds that he's only done *some* of those things. Brain's eyes than light up. After being privvy to Edgar's experience at this point in the book, the reader is left wondering if Edgar's admission is a terrible lie or a terrible truth?Edgar's middle name begins with a P but we are never told what it is. I wondering if it is Pepper. Hope not.Perhaps my favorite book read in the last 5 years.At first I didn't understand why the character sometimes wrote in the third person for a paragraph or two throughout the book. Later, I thought this may be a reference to some indian hallucination---seeing yourself from outside. Read it and decide for yourself."
3,pure childhood nostalgia,"I grew up in the 50's and 60's watching brave Robin Hood outsmart the nasty Sheriff of Nottingham. The transfers of the old 1950's prints are excellent considering their age and it's easy to find individual episodes. This pack of every episode is excellent value for money...it will take me months to view them all. Only a baby-boomer would love them for nostalgia sake. Like Superman, there is a lot of ""suspension of disbelief"" required. It was good, clean, values-driven TV for kids in the 60's. An added bonus is that the discs are ""region free"" meaning they can be played in any country."
5,An excellent contribution to several historical fields.,"Benson writes about department stores' development as the new purveyors of mass culture and as the setting for a dynamic intersection of class and gender. She describes the encounters of saleswomen, managers, and customers in this retail environment between 1890 and 1940. Benson accomplishes this by combing through various journals and newspapers, and the results of this research are placed into perspective through comparison with other labor historians' work. Although the juxtaposition of Benson's work with others' reveals some flaws, _Counter Cultures_ nevertheless presents an important and vivid picture of a service industry, a neglected area of labor history"
3,"Not bad, but not a lot stands out for me in this one","When it comes to Queen, there's a slump for me after ""News Of The World"" which begins to rise back up with ""A Kind Of Magic"". I don't like too much on this album, but don't dislike the material -- it just doesn't do much for me. ""It's A Hard Life"", ""Machines"", ""I Want To Break Free"", and ""Hammer To Fall"" are standout tracks, but the rest of it, while (IMHO) not bad, just don't rise to the level of some of their other material (that the band was able to put out so many good albums is a testament to their talents). But this is just my opinion, to each his/her own. Any way you slice it, Queen was a great band."
4,Vamp Noir,"Take the underworld of the 40s film noir and mix it with the comic book Blade, and the result will be something that closely resembles Jon F. Merz's The Fixer. This books marks the promising start of a new series which will appeal to anyone who is tired of the goth-chique vampires of Anne Rice.The novel is fast-paced and very atmospheric. You are thrown into the noir world which you saw so often in the 40s crime films. Lawson reminded me a little of the Bogarts of that era, only with more muscles and with a badder, more sarcastic attitude.Although the books lags a little in its central part (Merz gives us too much background info on Lawson; he could have stretched it out over the next few books), the rest of a the book is great fun. The wry, sarcastic humour and the often funny situations elevates this book over the B-style novel it could easily have become.The Fixer isn't mind blowing, but it is a great read that will keep you entertained until its very last page."
2,Sometimes you just have to doubt the 5 stars,"Well everyone. I am convinced that whoever gave this book 5 stars really didn't read it... The book had decent writing in most aspects, plot, character development, but the verisimilitude of the character and consistency within the story were very poor. I kept getting knocked out of the story when I would come across an inconsistent fact or opinion; the main character kept talking a good game but acting like a chump. I would give it 1 star and leave it at that if there was nothing good about the story. The author does have a decent original world and with more development and better editing it could have been a good book. I have read better free works online. Better luck next time."
5,The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom: 1750-1925,"This book has already been accepted as a well-recognized source of information related to slavery because of its attention to details not easily found in other sources, for example: the emotional ruptures and affect between parents when families were separated. The focus on the adaptation to the realities of the slave experience and subsequent ""freedom"" makes this required reading for anyone interested in this topic.Patricia Heaston, Ph.D."
2,The first cd was soooo much better,"The first cd had so much edge and attitude and it spoke to the soul. This cd is, quite frankly, unoriginal and boring."
4,Surprise,Surprisingly fun and nice sound. This BS has more talent than most serious artists and she takes it for what it is: light entertainment and makes it fun and pleasant.Worth a listen or two. Or more.
5,Great !!!!,"I have both of her efforts and this one is as strong if not better. She is as strong in concert, a pure voice not studio engineered. This CD will grow on you and you'll find that you leave it in the player more often then not. A purchase you will not regret."
4,Seabiscuit on skates,"I realy like this book, I just started reading it and I'm totally hooked. I'm not a big hockey fan so I think a little bit is lost on me, but this book really draws you into the characters in the traditions of the best sports stories. The whole ""parent of student athlete"" is captured well and that's probably something we all need to be talking more about."
4,"Very good, and useful, but lacks guidelines for values",This book is great at showing the importance of recognizing one's values and not contradicting them with one's actions. Further it has exercises to help one discover one's values and keep them more in focus. The only shortcoming is the book's failure to show how reality precludes certain choices. I recommend the book Viable Values by Tara Smith to cover that gap.
4,"""Great ideas and ideals from a man who lives as he writes""","Hyrum Smith does an excellent job portraying the tools we all need to use in our life if we are to succeed. As I just happen to live in the same area as he does it would be wonderful to run into him someday. Most of the material he's used in this book has been used (either books or tapes) by him before. However, like any positive material, it is all worth repeating. The only drawback to this book (four stars) is that it dwells so much on Hyrums experiences- rather than giving usable advice to its readers (the old WIIFM). This book did leave me with the warm fuzzies, which by the way, is one of the ways I rate a book. If you are a reader of self-help books, this is a winner."
4,We had a good night jamming away.,"This album by Queen was released in 1989. It was their first album to dispense with individual songwriting credits. All four group members are credited on all the songs, whether they actually had a hand in the writing or not. Queen's popularity in the US was way down at this point. The only single from the album to make the American pop charts was ""I Want It All"", which peaked at a meager #50 on the Hot 100. However, Queen remained tremendously popular in the rest of the world. Five songs from this album were hits in the UK. ""I Want It All"" reached #3, ""Breakthru"" reached #7, ""The Invisible Man"" peaked at #12, ""Scandal"" reached #25 and ""The Miracle"" topped out at #21. Overall, this is a very good album, although the lack of recognizable US hits may make it less popular with American listeners."
1,ties are too long,the ties are too long and stick out on either side either your side or your neighbors side and the fence was horrible. I will not do anymore fence ordering through an online company.
1,I Hate Wack Rappers,"Let Me Review This songLyrics: 1/10 He Got 1 point because he made an attempt.Production: 3/10 Horrible Version Of An Ice Cream Truck Beat.Single Cover: 1/10 horrible cover nothing special. No meaning.Depth/Meaning: 0/10 Pointless Song Not Even Good To Dance To In My Opinion.Overall 5/40I Havent Heard His Album Yet But I Doubt It Would Be Any Better Than This Crap Excuse Of A Single.Hip Hop Really Is Dead Thanks To People Like Mims, Mike Jones ,All the lils and youngs (except maybe a few cant think of any lils or youngs that are good) and all the other wack mainstream rappers (except a few like nas, lupe, jay z etc u get me the good mainstream rappers)STOP SUPPORTING POP RAPPERS LIKE THIS.Ps. I Couldnt Be Bothered Making An Account I just Wanted To Write A Quick Review."
2,Hagiography for the 21st century,"Hagiographies were, historically, written for the edification of the faithful. That describes this disappointing work rather well: for those who wish to hear only the positive, and the classic story of repentance and redemption, the basic story is competently told, and it will, perhaps, serve its purpose. But it offers little or nothing to the thinking Christian (or non-) reader: there is little or no critical evaluation of Colson and his story and (disappointing to this reader) little too on the remarkable movement that he has been so involved in creating and leading, Prison Fellowship. Colson's is an inspiring story, but little or no purpose is served by setting him up as a plaster saint. There is a fascinating tale to be told, and real Christians still struggle today with the moral ambiguities and compromises of life in the world's centres of power. Sadly, this book is not the one for them."
4,Play the Game,"A solid album from Queen with several of Queen's best known songs on it. The songs are all at least decent, and some of them are great. The remix of ""Dragon Attack"" is even interesting, although I'm sure some of Queen's old fans will hate it."
3,Laziness sets in...,"I actually saw Queen on this tour, (good thing since they only hit America once more!) and though I was quite young I had been buying their stuff for years and greatly admired them. I remember my heart sinking when the first thing I heard after dropping the needle (remember those?), was a SYNTH! Stunning since Queen had always made a point of proudly including 'NO SYNTHS!' in their liner notes up to that point. Anyway, most of the songs turned out to be great, but there was an atmosphere of laziness here, and the whole thing came across as being sparse and simplistic. The synth certainly didn't add anything, and seemed utterly pointless. The songs are well written, so why add a synth ?! It's just crammed in there to add some unnecesary 'modern' texture! Later, Queen used electronic music to better effect ( The Miracle, Innuendo) but they jumped the gun on The Game."
4,NICE SURPRISE,"I HAD I VERY NICE SURPRISE WHEN I RECIBED THE ORIGINAL VW BEETLE BOOK. IT IS VERY GOOD ILUSTRATED, WHITH GOOD QUALITY, FULL COLOR PHOTOS. THE CARS IN THE PHOTOS ARE REALY NICE, IN EXCELLENT ORIGINAL CONDITIONS. THE BOOK PRESENTS VERY USEFULL INFORMATION ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF THE VW, INDICATING FOR EACH YEAR, SINCE 1945, THE MAIN CHANGES. IN RESUME THE BOOK LOOKS LIKE A BARGAIN BOOK, BUT HAS INFORATION LIKE A CONSULTING BOOK. I WILL RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO MY FRIENDS, THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE VW. ALSO I THINK THE BOOK USEFULL FOR PEOPLE INTERESTED IN THOSE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS WHICH HAVE MADE HISTORY."
5,A Very New Ronan Keating Fan Speaks Up,"I have just listened to Ronan's collection and frankly all I have to say to the nay-sayers is: Get a life; this guy is good (and a hottie to boot!) So what is the matter with covers, particularly if they are done with style and grace. And these certainy were. I actually prefer his version of ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"" to The Garth's and that is quite an encomium. I have only one fault to find with Ronan and that is that he won't come over here and entertain us. He and Richard Marx are the two class acts left and it would be such a pleasure to hear those voices blended in unison.All in all I think it would be fair to say that this is a very good album, particularly for easy listening; one you would pop into the CD player in the car when taking a drive. Bring us some more good stuff, Ronan."
1,such a waste of great acting talent,thomas jane rules. the crazy chick from happiness rules. bad writing/directing/editing makes this show the opposite of rules.
5,It's Queen,"It's Queen of course I love it. I really like this CD alot, some songs on it are kind of like Jim Croche (did I spell that right? lol) or have a feel similar in the way the words flow. The songs make me think of a fantasy novel, White Queen really reminds me of a poem by Keats. Can't recommend it enough."
4,My least favorite,"I have all the Queen CD's, and this is my least favorite. But it is still better than most other bands i have heard. My favorite Tracks are, ""Ogre Battle"" and ""The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke"", they have a lot of Queen that is yet to comeAll in all, in my oppinion, Their worst, but still the best compared to other bands.P.S. i am writing reviews for all of queen's albums"
5,Must-have for music fans,"This is one of my favourite Queen albums, second only to A Day At The Races. If you're a Queen fan, you simply have to have it. If you're not, get it anyway :)"
5,THE BEST ROCK ALBUM IN HISTORY,"Most people would dismiss my title as overheated hyperbole, but those are the same people that relly havn't LISTENED to this album. I first got this album as a 10-year-old child and I would listen to it at night(with headphones) lying in bed in the dark. The experience was always otherworldly and fantastic.22 years later I still have not heard another album like it.That alone speaks for itself. It goes way beyond nostalgia, this album truly is amazing. Songs like FATHER TO SON, FAIRY FELLER""S MASTERSTROKE, MARCH OF THE BLACK QUEEN, NEVERMORE, FUNNY HOW LOVE IS...ETC., flow seamlessly together like one long, glorious holiday carol.Please buy this album and play it for your friends. It is truly magnificent."
5,Corny but spectacular.,"This is one of those albums you're ashamed to admit you like. It's from back when Queen wore the matching white spandex suits and sang songs about castles and queens and really stupid stuff. However, that does not detract from the music itself which is extraordinary. The range of tempos and musical styles is amazing not to mention Freddie Mercury's incredible operatic voice. Some of the songs are straight ahead hard rock and some are weepy ballads and I don't know what the hell to call ""The Fairie Fellers Master Stroke"". But it all comes together in a weird way. In a time when all the rock bands were stating to electronisize with synthesizers, Queen went the other way by using only piano and guitars (on the album jacket it says ""and no one played the synthesizer again.....""). Sure it's corny and listed as one of the worst albums ever in a book I saw once but I really love it and accept it for the cheesy arena rock that it is."
3,Can you hear me you peers and privvy counsellors?,"This was (obviously) Queen's second album. Queen was sort of a glam/progressive/arty group at this point. They had not quite developed their ""signature sound"" by this point, but they were on their way. There aren't really any ""classic"" queen songs here, other than their first hit, the great ""Seven Seas of Rhye"". The CD adds three bonus tracks, ""See What a Fool I've Been"", which was the b-side of ""Seven Seas of Rhye"", and two useless remixes of songs from the original album."
2,Dog didn't like them,"My dog likes bully sticks, raw hides, pig ears, treats and bones. She is not picky. But for some reason she did not like these bones. I didn't like them either because they made a mess in the house."
3,"Chow carries it, but not much chewing.","This is an update. There is a major issue here. It immediately flakes and makes a mess. Not suitable for in house use.My Chow loves to chew, and his favorites are IAMS Tartar Treats and Greenies. Purchased the case of this GI Bone, at a very good price on Amazon (Entirely Pets). Fast shipping from that Vendor. Good Vendor.The dog is proud of his bone, and occasionally carries it, but isn't chewing it much. Wish I purchased one at the store, instead of buying a whole case. I'll probably drop the rest off at our local No-Kill shelter (SISCA). I think 3 stars is fair."
4,I give it 4 out of 5 starts,It was easy to read and I liked how the vocabulary was worked into later chapters.
1,snoop dogg's doggystyle (unrated),"Totally Beware!This is the Soft-core version!(calling it 'unrated' seems to imply that it's 'xxx',but this is Not the Original XXX version.)This is totally lame, and not at all worth spending your money on."
2,Soft core all right but the hardcore version is better,If your the type that likes to see some T&A; then this is the movie for you. I bought this thinking this was the real version not paying attention to details this is the soft-core version with added scenes and deleted good stuff. If you really are a [...] then get the hardcore version because this version [...].I made the mistake now Im happy I got the real version.
2,not the original,"If I had not saw the original. i might have given 3-4 stars for the music. But this is listed for sale as unrated it needs to be what the DVD states Rated ""R"". I am being sent another copy if it is the same i will return it."
2,Silence of the Lambs this is not....,"This is not even in the same category as silence of the lambs. These disturbed people are far less intriguing and much more predictable than Hannibal Lechter. I thought that the original idea was good, but the most exciting parts are on the back cover. I have read all of Harris' books and this is by far the least compelling of them all. I would not recommend this book as a gripping read at all."
3,"Good, but not his best","I love Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. This is not Harris's best work. I still liked it, but you can tell it is his rookie novel. Still, I'd recommend it."
5,A Must Have Dessert Cookbook,"I wish desserts from this book were on the menus of some of the better restaurants I've eaten in. I've tried out a number of them on family and friends to rave reviews. Nobody doesn't like lemon, and this book shows how many ways it can make a great dessert. Some of the recipes are also somple, such as the Lemon-Caramel Pots de Creme. The Perfect Lemon Tart, artfully pictured on the book's cover, is the best version I've tasted of one of my favorite desserts. I'm still working my way through the book and can't wait to try the Chocolate Ganache Tart with Lots of Lemon, though my son is lobbying for Lemonade Fruit Jewel Popsicles. If you're not already a lemon lover, this book will give you new respect for this often underappreciated flavor."
5,Cats Galore!,I love this mouse pad. This is actually my 2nd. I wore out the first and loved it so much I bought another just like it.
2,Hed Kandi gone dull,"Hed Kandi was cream of the crop for sophiticated dance CD's, well no more. Since Hed Kandi's creative founder left it has been a steady drop in the quality of the Hed Kandi product, and this new Twisted Disco series release has to be the saddest yet. I love the artists listed but the mixes are dull, the tracks do not build any momentum. Twisted Disco releases used to be naughty down and dirty fun, this one is just down. Just because the mix is deeper and darker does not make it good or interesting. This CD is a prime example."
2,"Nice looking, doesn't hold up",A very attractive kettle but the plastic holder on the lid broke off in a matter of a few months. This is not a particularly sturdy kettle. Not recommended.
4,Tite,"This is a nice overall album, for being underground and for being Latin Artist, this album was put together very nice. Also, being that I never heard of these guys. They did a good job and there beats and lyrics are put together nice. Good job and when is the next one coming out? Peace out."
4,A Great Morse Book,"This is when Dexter is at the top of his game, bringing to life a great mystery with interesting psychological dimensions. Morse also is at his best in solving a tough crime with his predictable genius."
2,wrong title!!,"I am very disappointed about this book. It absolutely has a wrong title. The author may have different definition of ""Intuitive Design"". Detailed excamples in this book are helpful for beginner. But after go through all of the equations and derivations, you can not get any ideal about intuitive design!"
4,A nice book if you are not picky about the title!,"I have hesisted to buy this book due to some comments from other customers. After reading and quickly scanning, I found that it is a nice book for application engineer in this field. It deserves to get four stars. I bought this book and it is a really nice book if you want to catch analog design principle in a short time, especially when you are graduated 10 years ago and remember fundametal things only. The author is a practical guy who is a top manager in the company. I think his writing style is matched up to his work and previous experience in real world. I like this style. For some pure designers, it may not be a good book. However, it is really a nice book for an application engineer. I'm an application engineer as well as an analog designer."
2,Haikus aren't news...,"I enjoyed David Bader's ""How to be an Extremely Reform"" Jew. However, I found this, his second take on contemporary Jewish culture, to be insipid and ultimately meaningless.Beyond the first few chuckles, I can't help feeling that these haikus are geared towards a fading generation and constipated stereotypes that have been ""done"" to death: the lavish bar mitzvah, the ambitious Jewish mother.Maybe I'm asking too much of a humour book. Maybe I should just grin and walk away. But the classics, by authors like Leo Rosten (The Joys of Yiddish) and Joseph Telushkin (Jewish Humor : What the Best Jewish Jokes Say About the Jews) -- and even Bader's first book -- all prove that when Jews read humour, we do it to learn more about ourselves.Humour offers a painless lesson in Jewish reality, which is sometimes troubling and unpleasant in real life. Haikus for Jews, on the other hand, offers little fresh insight, treading a well-worn path younger Jews are increasingly reluctant to follow."
4,Important and exciting trumpet\arranger from the west coast!,"Greg Adams continues to write and perform wonderful and exciting music after his exit as arranger and trumpeter in Tower of Power. Adams had always been in demand as the ""arranger's arranger"" for horn section and string section writing throughout the world. This is Adam's debut as a leader on his solo project. If you enjoy music in a jazz\funk style with great trumpet and fluegelhorn playing this is for you."
2,"Thin volume disappoints, doesn't match description","Disappointing. In reality this ""book"" is little more than a catalog for the large Klemantaski collection of photos. Not only is it a very thin volume, but it's small too - only about 5""x7"". The selection of pictures is very good and the reproduction is better than average. Text is minimal, with only a 1- or 2-sentence caption per picture. It's really too bad, because Klem's body of work is generally outstanding."
3,"Orchestrations are outstanding, that's about it.","If you like MFL, buy the OBC (1956) with Harrison and Andrews (even the 1959 OLC is better than this). The orchestrations by Andre Previn, however, are outstanding. And it is wonderful to hear some of the incidental music/dialog. The worst thing about this album is Marni Nixon. Her cockney accent is almost non-existent and her singing is really awful. Rex Harrison sounds like he's singing into a tin can and is off the beat in many places. Don't buy it unless you are a diehard fan of MFL."
2,Zzzzzzzz,"Although informative, the author needs almost 400 pages to say what could have easily been said in well under 100."
4,Good silver,Not quite the workmanship I would have hoped for - but they are nice and I wear them quite a bit.
2,Errr...not great.,"Sorry to those of you calling it ok, but it's really not. I kept it for a couple weeks and returned it. I've never returned ANYTHING to Amazon, but this was not the best $200 I've spent.I guess it's ok if the picture wouldn't be sharp under any circumstances, likes kids on a ride at a theme park. But for anything else, nah. Good range at 70-300, but slow focus and slow apeture.Sorry, can't recommend it. The price isn't the issue - the pictures are. If they are worth taking, they are worth being good. This won't help you with that."
5,Nice design,Nicely designed and very good quality. The big toasting space gives me the possibility to toast any kind of bread I want.
5,Best little toaster on the planet,"My husband hated our ""new"" Cuisanart toaster. He longed for the day I'd bring down the Rowenta, made in West Germany, from the attic. Upon a visit to a friend's condo, we were marveling at his new upscale kitchen, and the Braun toaster caught his eye. He was totally enamored on looks alone. When he heard how easy it was to use, how perfect the toast was every time, and that it was cool to the touch (a feature of the Rowenta as well), I knew a match had been made in kitchen heaven. And, the best part was I found it on Amazon! This toaster has lived up to all its hype. It truly is the best little toaster on the planet."
5,"Sleek look, performs great!","This toaster not only looks good, it does my toasting to perfection. I use it for English muffins as well as regular bread, and with some adjustment on the setting, it gets each done exactly to my tastes. I don't keep gadgets out on the counter, but this would look good if I did. I store it in a cabinet and it is sleek and light weight, easy to tuck away."
1,extreme disappointment,"I'll start off by saying that I was a big sunny day real estate fan and dug Jeremy Enigk's solo album. When I first heard about The Fire Theft project, I was genuinely excited. Every once in a while I'd check their website to see if they'd set a release date or made any mp3's available. I remember downloading the song Sinatra. I didn't like it, but i remained hopeful. I bought this album the day it was released and listened to it intently when I got home. I didn't like it, but thought maybe it would grow on me. I left it alone for a while. Every once in a while I'd throw it in, give it another chance. I really wanted to like it. Eventually I gave up and accepted that my first instinct had been correct; this album is awful."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed with this purchase. The small finger brushes were SO small, they would not even start to fit my finger. I even tried my pinkie (little) finger. No way! Also, the chewable breath mints were not there. The toothbrush is ok, but my dog does not like the toothpaste at all."
3,it is not the item I ordered,in the amazon's page the item contains -toothpaste -pet toothbrush - soft pet finger brush and 6 chewable breath mints but I received another soft pet finger brush instead the breath mints without explanation !!!mimm
5,seven and the sun will go far,"When I first heard ""walk along with me"" I thought well this will be a one hit wonder band, but then I heard it again and thought ""No way! this band is going to do something."" I thought that because they have a whole new sound to them. They make you think of Vertical horizon, with a 2002 feel :). Their music is soled good music. Each song gives a new meaning and new feel to your soul. I love the cd cause, you want to get up and dance! but this cd and you will love it too!!"
3,so so,not terrible by any means..... just mediocreits good background music that most all people would find acceptable if youre having friends overbut you wont be moved to rock out and sing in your car embarrassing yourself at traffic signals
5,XD,"Ah, the joy that comes with raising children. the creators of this strip put a very humorous spin on the trials that come with raising children. Anyhoo, Driving Under The Influence Of Children is another very good treasury with comics from the books two plus one is enough and playdate: catergory 5. My favorite strip in this book is the one where zoe drives her mother insane by asking her why wren does all the things that she can't do. BTW, Zoe is my favorite character."
1,Boring,"All I can say about this book is ""Bo-o-oring! After wonderful and lavishly illustrated dinosaur books of Yollen, this one (we took it in a library) is very disappointing. My daughter didn't like it, and neither did I. Maybe it's appealing to very young toddlers that still learn their colors, but it's sort of blah for my 22-month old."
3,Interesting but...,"I thought that I would like this book of short stories better than I did. The subject matter, natural history, is one of great interest to me, however I found the stories a bit dry. The 19th century views of science that she portrayed were quite entertaining, and the prose gave me the feel of walking though a Victorian museum filled with curio cabinets containing jars of esoterica with handwritten paper labels.Many people who gave this book high reviews were entertained by the fact that these stories were populated with characters from some of her novels - perhaps if I had read the novels first, I would have been more engaged in the characters."
3,Boy's Own revisited,"'The 39 Steps' was a set text when I was in Year 8 (1953) but all I remembered was the chase around Scotland (which I found very similar to the description of David Balfour's adventures in R L Stevenson's 'Kidnapped').The story is very dated...jingoistic, racist and absolutely unbelievable. It reminded me of the chauvinistic 'Boy's Own' stories in my father's old annuals which I devoured as a youngster.(Very much in the style of G A Henty and Percy Westerman.)Nevertheless, it is quite entertaining and well worth the $0.00 cost!"
1,Not my kind of book,"The hero of this novel expresses anti-Semitic views. Since this was offensive to me, I stopped listening to the CD after the first 20 minutes."
3,Not the best mystery I've read,"One reason I enjoyed reading this story was because of the era in which it takes place. I'm a nostalgia nut and like anything 19th or early 20th century. The story was put together well and made me want to finish the book. It was not one of those you read just because you started it, but a Christie, or Rex Stout quality story here is not something you'll find.For free on my Kindle I can't complain at all."
3,Too Much Theory,This book has too much theory and not enough step-by-step direction in how to run a writing workshop. I started it but lost interest.
4,Excellent F1 Simulation,"All in all I found this to be an excellent F1 simulation. The XBox controller provides smooth control, with the right trigger as the throttle, the left trigger the brake, and the left analog stick for steering.Players can choose from all 23 tracks and all the 2001 drivers.The casual gamer can turn off damage and drive in ""Normal"" mode; the biggest challenge is to stay on the track. More advanced drivers can add whatever degree of realism they like, including damage, fuel usage, tire wear and penalties. The cars can be tweaked before each race; some of the settings include gear ratios (pre-set and custom), front and rear wing angle, tire pressure and type, and so on."
5,Awesome!,"Brian May is, of course, one of the greatest rock gutarists - This record took an extensive amount of time to be completed and you can notice that in every song.There are records to play in background when a visit comes to your house, with that background music you can chat, eat, or whattever. - But there are some records to listen with plenty of attention, and this is one of them.The poweful sound that Brian creates takes you into a real musical roallercoaster, as he does with Queen music.This record it's a must have for the Queen and Brian's fans. But also, for general musical lovers, it's a true piece of genuine rock, with that Brian May trademark."
3,Acceptable,"CD sound was fine, brochure was acceptable too, being a second hand material, but CD plastic cover was broken. Due to the price I accepted that."
1,I sold it back to the record store,"Brian May is one of my all time favorite guitarists. I couldn't wait to hear ""Back to the Light"". 'Disappointing', hardly begins to express what I felt when I first listened. I thought maybe it would get better with repeated exposure but if anything it just sounded more shallow. I have never sold any CD back till now but this is one I would rather not hear again. I hope Brian gets out of the mood that inspired ""Light"" and brings us more of the masterful work we've come to expect."
5,Very Helpful,"This book has answered all my questions. It tells the ins and outs of the martial arts in clear, easy to understand language. I can now ask the right questions and know what to look for in an instructor or school ( DOJO ). I recommend reading this book to anyone interested in studying the martial arts!"
2,Rambling and incoherent,"I am a history buff and an avid reader of anything written about the Wars of the Roses. This book, however, was hard to finish. The narrative style is so rambling and incoherent that it is difficult to follow. Facts, dates, and quotes are muddled, sentence structure is meandering and the author never seems able to make a point. How this book got past a copy editor, I'll never figure out."
4,cat fancier's association complete csat book,"a very informative book for the cat lover, with bright color pictures, discriptions of temperment , hair color of each cat. a very good book to have on hand."
4,car review,This RC car is fun! The first one did not work properly so IGg worked with me to replace it. WAY TO GO IGg Handheld Items!Car functions as stated.
2,Disappointing,I bought this book hoping to learn some new strategies for empowering my employees and improving our team's effectiveness. What I found instead were a lot of anecdotes and case studies that were totally irrelevant to my workplace. It's hard to believe that anyone would benefit from this book - I would have thought most companies that had strong centralized leadership and poor information flow would have gone out of business. Perhaps my work experience is not typical.
3,Nice pocket-book,"The book looks like a nice picturebook, but it's not realy a documentary with a lot of background stories (which I hoped it would be)."
1,Doesnt Wobble!,"Lousy toy I have ever bought. The base is not sturdy and the red top doesnt sit well on the base. So it doesnt wobble at all. Leave alone my kid struggling to play with it, even adults cant figure out what to do with it. There are scores of other great toys for this price! Not worth your $$"
3,Purchased for required class,The book arrived in good condition in a timely manner. It was the required text for a college course.
3,Fellow Workers,"Found out you got to love them, or you might not understand some of there songs, fairly well done ... just not into it all that much'it's a bit Folk and down home country hill billy yarn' ...kind of music... that's why I only put up 3 stars... but I know others who know them will like it' and ya there are one or two songs he's got on it that I like' so it's not all that bad... ya know'"
3,Decent follow up,"Wow, for the record, this really isn't a DiFranco album - it's mostly Utah Phillips with accompaniment from Ani. And that's okay by me. The music is actually very interesting, and quite unlike what Ani has displayed on her own albums.Don't know what it is about this album though. Political judgements aside, as a musical experience is doesn't work. It's more a documentary with background music by Ani. In fact, it achieves exactly what it set out to do. So what's wrong with that?"
1,Big disappointment,"I'm a huge fan of Ani di Franco, I bougth this record thinkink that I will listen to some music and there are only stories that do not relate in any wat with me , no music,no substance, No Ani di Franco. WASTE OF MONEY !"
4,Suspend your Disbelief,"I have spent a number of incredibly enjoyable hours over the past few days devouring Summerland (when I should have been writing, playing with my kids, etc.,). Chabon has pulled from a variety of mythologies, Native American legends, and a remarkable storehouse of baseball lore in order to create an engrossing world of fantastic creatures and thrilling adventures. If John Irving, Stephen King, and Susan Cooper decided to write a book together, they just might come up with one as compelling as Summerland. Yes, Summerland is quite different from the magnificent Kavalier & Clay, but it is still uniquely Chabon--with its funky humor, in-depth characterization, and unusual vision, all steered by a questing morality. Suspend your disbelief, sit back, and enjoy. Incidentally, although Summerland is classified as adolescent lit, I found it in the adult section at my local library."
2,trite,"trite, reminds me of highschool art class full of earnest drawings attempting to tackle the great subjects- religion, peace, love by using a crucifix, a peace sign, and a heart all in the same picture."
4,Fairly good,"This is a wonderful story in a handful of ways, and the first I have read by Michael Chabon. While it didn't live up to true fantasy fiction and there are many better stories, The Kingdoms and the Elves for a certainty, I enjoyed reading the story. I was impressed at times and do look forward to reading his other books."
3,Summerland,Ethan Feld is perhaps the worst baseball player ever. Not a problem if you don't have to play but a big problem when the world depends on you playing it. Ethan has been scouted by Old Ringfinger Brown since he was a boy. Ethan and his crew must save the tree of life before the Coyote can kill it and everthing else in the four worlds. I liked the book but it was a little slow at parts. If you are willing to stick it out you will see how good the book really is.
2,Not really for kids,"I don't see that any kids have weighed in with positive reviews, and I'm not surprised. Long-winded doesn't begin to describe this book. While there's some strong prose, there are also so many elements thrown in and then abandoned, you just have to wonder if Chabon had an editor. He introduces new creatures, languages, and places--then never gets back to them. The depiction of minorities is disturbing. A black ""bigfoot"" woman with a good singing voice who's in a cage, until 3 white kids rescue her. A Latino ballplayer just lying around until the same kids get him moving. Hmmm... And a lot of Native American folklore taken out of context. But, overall, the main problem is that the writing is too sluggish for kids, who don't keep reading a book just because the author's famous!"
5,Norse mythology and baseball!!,"I just finished reading this to my son. It seems as though none of the other reviewers (including the ""editorial reviews"") noticed that most of the mythology is Norse -- from Ragged Rock (Ragnarok, the destruction of the gods) the Ash tree that is at the center of the world (Yggdrasil); Murmury well (spring of Mimmer); old Mr. Wood, (Wotan); Coyote/Exu/Loki, the god of the crossroads... and doubtless others I missed. This is a wonderful combination of old and new, a delight in legend and story telling."
2,Major league disappointment,"My eight year old daughter and I approached this book with such eagerness, as we both love baseball and magic. On page 115 we made the mutual decision to give up. Michael Chabon is a talented writer for adults but he has no clue how to structure a story for young minds. Characters are fuzzy, the plot is hard to follow, and there's a lot of overwriting. (We kept saying, ""Who is he again? Who are the bad guys again? What do they want?"" and paging back to find out. By page 115 we still weren't clear, and ceased to care.) The more I read other writers of fiction for young people, the more I appreciate J.K Rowling."
2,Publisher should be ashamed!,"The play itself is brilliant--but beware!This is advertised as an acting edition; any actor who actually gets through a week of rehearsal with it intact is a magician.It is cheaply zeroxed, on flimsy paper; in many places the type is only partly legible.Apparently at one time it was cheaply typed too, because several lines are omitted from the original, creating confusion in some spots. In one case, an actor's lines are jammed up against the previous speaker's dialogue.The ""perfect"" binding fell apart in several of these with only minor handling.I bought these for a reading group at a public library and the participant's average age is 70, so it's not a case of teenagers throwing them around & jamming them in their back packs.DPS should be ashamed of this shoddy product!If Dover can create acting editions of Shakespeare & Shaw--which really do hold up--for less than $5, DPS should either do the same or charge a lot less."
1,No standard on definition of GIANT print-buyer beware!,"Just bought this Bible from Amazon as a gift and paid for overnight shipping (which I assume I will lose on the refund). I am returning this Bible today because the type-size is actually 11.5 - too small to read even in the best of light if you have vision/reading issues. The type size is clearly indicated on the back of the cardboard cover. Too bad it is not included in the product description. I have since visited a book store and learned that GIANT print can be anything from 11 pt to 18 pt type, not the 14 pt I already own. Very disappointed in this purchase. Type size should be required in all LARGE and GIANT Bible product descriptions."
3,"Good Paranormal Story, Writing Style Undeveloped","A decent story with some thought put into the plot, the ""uncommon sense"" is probably one that is more believeable than others. With good representations of realistic disbelief of professionals, concern by co-workers, loyal belief by friends, and malevolence from an old high school acquaintance, Cooper uses her uncommon sense to recognize truths and lies to seek a missing youth and uncover crimes in situations that initially appear to be plausible. The writing style would benefit from improvements in transitions and lead-in introductions of actions, but the 99 cent story provides value with a good story line and likeable characters."
3,JUST SAY NO IS THE REAL TRUTH,"THEIR ARE SEVERAL MAIN CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK.THE FIRST CHARACTER IS JOHN.HE IS A 22 YEAR OLD SINGER.THEN THIER IS HIS BEST FRIEND DARIN HARMON.HE IS 22 YEARS OLD AND IS ALSO JOHNS MANAGER. TANGELA IS 25 YEARS OLD AND WAS JOHN FIRST REAL GIRLFRIEND.TONY IS JOHN'S DRUM PLAYER, AND BIG JOE IS HIS BODYGUARD. THEY ALL GET ALONG WELL, BUT WHEN JOHN STARTS TO CHANGE AND DARIN STOPS BEING HIS MANAGER THINGS START TO FALL APART.JOHN STARTS A NEW LIFE DEALING WITH HARD DRUGS AND THE WRONG KIND OF PEOPLE.I LIKED THIS NOVEL BACAUSE IT IS A REAL LIFE THING. SINGERS RIGHT NOW ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS. THIS BOOK GIVES US A LOOK INSIDE THE LIFE OF A CELEBRITY AND ALL OF THERE REAL LIFE PROBLEMS. IT SHOWS US HOW HARD BEING A CELEBRITY REALLF IS BEHING ALL OF THE GLITS AND GLAMOUR. I WOULD REECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO IS TRYING TO BECOME PART OF THE MUSIC BUISSNESS."
1,Disappointing,"It took me three weeks to read this book, for it was just not interesting. The parts in the book where they wrote the lyrics to the songs with that riffs and everything was just too distracting. The ending was good though, I almost cried. But I almost cried while reading the book because it took too long to get to the point. In the space of reading this book, I sat and read three other books, and this one was read as a last resort when I had nothing else to read. It may be interesting to people that are into that stuff."
2,"When you see this book on the shelf, Just Say No","The book held my attention for the first few chapters, then it became so predictable. I was hoping that somewhere in that dribble there was some sort of plot twist or turn. But there wasn't even decent character development, the women's roles were a joke. The writing was repetitive, one sexual exploit after another, one recording session after another, one concert after another, and drug usage galore. You can see this same scenario anynight of the week on VH1's ""Behind the Music""."
2,Alfa Alfa is unhealthy for Guinea Pigs,"Whomever makes guinea pig food with Alfa-Alfa is not very knowledgeable about the piggie diet. Alfa-Alfa has calcium in it. Eventually the calcium builds up in their bladder and gives them bladder stones (which tend to be painful to pass), and ""sludge"" in their urine (also uncomfortable if there is too much of it).The best Guinea Pig food is Oxbow. It has no Alfa Alfa or small seeds (which are a choking hazard)."
4,A good way to teach science to children,"This books teaches people about the desert plants and animals as well as the climate. The real life and death struggle for survival is most intense at the edge of where life can survive. The result is some evolutionary marvels like toads and cute kangaroo rats.As short and too the point as this book is, I liked it."
2,Close but no Cigar,"A Really good tab book, pretty accurate except that there is a whole song missing (The one which I bought the tab book for = Shine On) but is replaced by another song which was already in the book.Living in the uk I couldnt be bothered to send it back to the US, so im just gonna grin and bare it, I know im a bit of a sucker but what can you do."
1,Nautica pants,"the pants say 42x32 but they have to be sized wrong I have a pair of the same pants I bought from Kauffmans and they fit great, but when I tried these pants on they didn't fit. I could even get them to go around my waist."
2,Mafia Manager,"The book is entertaining.Although it was not exactly what i expected.I'm not so sure of Mr. V.'s mafia connections.But i liked his managers advise.Would like to see another book written by Mr.V if he really is a capo.About the inner workings of the crime families.The day to day working.And how they do the loan sharking,numbers,illegal gambling dens ect.the quotes he puts in his book should have also have said who said them.If it was known."
4,Kiling Defense on Target,"Killing Defense is very well structured. Each hand is well illustrated and structured so you can follow the analysis. The hands vary in nature from simple to complex, and lead the reader through the thought process of the serious defender."
1,Crap,"This book is a joke to the Haitian religon.I take this book as an offense,as someone of Hatian descent.I am close to a real Haitian mambo and she said this book is a slap in the face to the religion.I hope the author is proud of himself for making a joke out of Vodou."
4,Great Hymns,This is a really great CD if you like country music and enjoy good old hymns. Jackson does a good job of capturing the hymns in a country style. I really enjoy this cd.
5,Alan the Great,"This is really a great CD. I felt like I was sitting in the country Baptist church on Sunday morning. Alan doesn't even have to try to make great music. I know his Mother is very proud of his gift to her. Thanks for sharing it with all of his fans. After I purchased my copy, I have gotten several more for gifts. Everybody just loves it."
5,Valet Rod - LOVE - Who knew....,We have literally renovated our entire house - master suite was the very last room to be done. Planning the closet was tricky. Did tons of research. Martha recommended a valet rod and we are SO pleased she did. We have 2 of them and I think I'm going to order 2 more. It's just SO very handy!
1,Very poorly done.,"Very bad mix on at least one song.I head the song ""I Walk The Line"" from this compilation and was amazed. It is very badly mixed. I own the columbia records compilation ""Johnny Cash's Greatest Hits Volume 1"" and the mix is very different even though it is obviously from the same recording session. The bass beat is significantly slower but the voice is only a bit slower. They make up for this by cutting out base notes every now and then. It make for a confused feel and does Cash a real disservice. The ""Super Hits"" people must have some weird idea of what sound they want.If you want to enjoy the music stay with a distributer with some musical morals."
4,Informative and entertaining,"If you are a Chet Atkins fan, and any guitar player should be, this little DVD is something that should always be in your collection. Not just ""how to play licks"" but a look at how Chet approached a song and how he thought."
1,sad,"IB used to be great. This cd was a big let down. The new vocalist is lame & can't hold a candle to Rini. What happened to their guitar sound?? It is weak. The drumming is still good, as well as the bass work. They have wimped out!!"
2,OK not Great Pliers,"Before purchasing these, I attempted to learn if they were Made in USA or not. Neither Amazon nor the company's site stated. When they came in, the pliers had no mark on them but the packaging showed they were made in China. They are designed well but manufactured only OK. I sprayed lubricant on them and tried to get their action smoother. Only got it marginally better. They work, but for almost $10 (from a discounter), I expected something smoother. Didn't get it."
4,Super Groovy,"What a great album from the first track through the last. I have at times played ""Slaveship"" over and over just to hear the ooooohhhs in the background. I got turned onto Rouse through some internet sampling and this is the first disc I got into - it is a super sound for all occasions - chillin out to drivin. If you like this one you'll also love Nashville."
3,I was there.,"If you were there(I was 17),you've heard this already,like you heard most good rock and roll the first time around. That being said,yes this is a faithful rendering of the way music sounded back then BUT- although Josh replicated the sound/songwriting to a T,it is almost a throwaway compared to his other material. You want Josh? Start with any of his other albums first. By the way,Nashville,his next album after this,was a great return to form.I am breathlessly waiting for the new one."
1,"Bad design,","The box or flat type container is not very handy to use. It wants to collapse on you. The better idea for this item is the triangular box they make that stays open. As for the product, it works great, it trapped the moths and eliminated them from my house."
2,not one of the better Sesame dvd's,"My daughter is almost 2 and loves sesame street! I bought this dvd for her to help learn the alphabet. She won't even sit through it for 3 minutes! It's boring and I tried making it fun but it isn't. I bought a different sesame alphabet dvd and she loves that one, and loves 123 count with me."
2,A bit disappointing,"I read the reviews for this product thinking it would be great and I was let down.It didn't really strike me as very entertaining, and it doesn't hold my children's interests for very long either.Some of the songs and skits are fun, but they're not tied together very well, and really the skits with Elmo, Zoe, and Telly aren't that great either.I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Not a good buy,"I bought this about 6 months ago for my daughter for a lot less and I'm still disappointed. Within the first two months, the night light stopped working and you cannot replace the bulb. The LCD on the clock is impossible to read unless you find the right angle. The only plus is that it is ""Princess"" and my daughter loves that. The radio has worked fine. In my opinion this product is not worth it though."
2,cute... if you just want to look at it,"i bought this alarm clock for my 5 year old (4 years old at the time)about 9 months ago. it's a very cute clock. i had trouble setting the clock, it's confusing at first. shortly after we got it the nightlight burned out and the song setting is VERY annoying and loud. it doesn't wake her up, it shocks her out of sleep. needless to say we're looking for another one for christmas this year."
5,Splendid Cult Smash Hit!!!!,"I bought this film because I like this kind of stuff. I wasn't expecting it to be that well done as a horror film and eventually it's convincing atmosphere left me hoping for sequels to be made in the future by it's creators , as happens with most successful cult films.The film receives all the criticism a very good and well done horror film deserves to receive.This film , to put it simply , is pure evil.And I like that.Hail!"
3,Lots of potential here and not much more,"If you haven't seen this film yet, then consider it a very good effort by Director Jon Knautz, and consider it only as a stepping stone to a great movie I'm sure he will make in the future. This guy has real potential and it really shows in the camera work, which reminds me of the creepy stage scenes used in several 1960's horror films.The acting is solid and the script is fine, it's the plot that ultimately fails. There's a twist to the story but I don't feel it was the right way to go. I think Knautz should have pursued other avenues.All in all, a decent horror film that's much, much better than a lot of the junk you see on direct-to-DVD horror films of late. Check it out."
2,Disappointed,"when i first got the movie it would not play in one of my dvd players, so i called the company i got it from and they sent another one it did the same thing.......sooooo i got to see the first half of the movie but could never get the second part to play in any dvd player."
1,garbage product,It isnt even wroth being sugar free. my stomach is aching and I am getting so much gas. I would rather stick with the normal werthers. I cant believe i bought 12 bags of this crap...
4,Action Packed!,"Action at it's best with juctice in the south, as Buford Pusser continued on with putting the bad guys in there place and setting things straight with the law. If you've seen ""WALKING TALL"" part 1, then this is a must for those who haven't seen part 2."
3,Woman on the American Frontier,"Attitudes belong in the respective eras. I have a long interest in women's diaries, but this isn't one. It was written by a man, with very little direct quotes from women's diaries or writings. It just wasn't what I expected it to be, and was disappointed."
4,Vintage Lawrence,"I had slight apprehension as to this novel being completely part of the Lawrence canon or not. True, it is not among the greatest Lawrence novels, such as ""Women in Love"", ""Sons and lovers"" or ""The Plumed Serpent"", nonetheless greatly enjoyable yarn about the West Australian outback in the late colonial era, and, best of all, completely and unmistakably -Lawrence.True enough the novel drags now and again, and it is gauche in its Victorian framework, but there's no one like Lawrence to bring forth the deeper currents of life. So, definitely worth your time. Even a single trenchant thought of Lawrence can make for an outstanding discovery (even if 100 previous pages were a just the usual narrative show-don't-tell drone...)Here's one: ""Perhaps death, after a life of real courage, is like a happy camping expedition to the unknown, before a new start."""
3,Checkered Flag Reveiw,"The flag was a good size but one of the grommets was missing off the flag. We will have to put one on the flag before we can use it. We gave one as a gift, I just hope it was in good condition."
2,"Wolf and Hogwood sitting in a tree, k i s s i n g","This was my first (and last) Kings Blade book. Duncan's writing style pulled me in, but the story mutates. The narrator's tone, a bit sarcastic, nonplussed and world-weary tough, fits the main protagonist and is fun to read. Very vicarious. But I kept waiting for the story to pick up and build on the initial premise of how a small force invaded a fortress and why they kidnapped the commander's main squeeze. It never does, and the answers, in my opinion, were weak and unfullfilling. Two-thirds into it I just didn't care anymore. When the author leads a reader to believe the story is about X, and then makes it about Y, the game is up. I can't describe exactly how this happens without giving away too many details, in case you decide to read it. I'd look elsewhere, though."
4,Gillette Fusion Power Phantom Razor,"I bought this for my husband, he had one and it broke andrequested another one. The idea that it is battery powered iswhat he liked about it."
4,Works Great,Great product that shaves well as it should. the vibration feature seems to actually help. the back blade on the tip is good for edging up sideburns and whatnot but needs to be sharper. my only real complaint is that the blades are WAY overpriced. i am highly considering an old school straight razor to go with my kiehl's shaving cream.
5,Great for head shaving,"I have tried other shavers to shave my head, this one works great. I shave and store my razor in the shower, the vibration power cuts through stubble without any effort, and I get 1 month per blade shaving my entire head and face nearly every day. I used to laugh at the ""5 blade"" models too until I started shaving my head, now I get it, it works great without getting dull. Cheap single blade razors only last a few days before going dull, non-power models require a lot of pull force."
1,Disappointed,"I bought a 68 Bus to restore, and needed some guidance. I expected, by the table of contents, to get it here. Rather, all this book really contained was an overview of the processes. While it showed photographs of some work being done, it did little to explain how to do it. Plus it skipped over such important issues as HOW to get rid of rust; HOW to apply bondo; HOW to use fiberglas: and on and on. The HOW TO is not in this book. As far as examples of different VW Busses, little there to stimulate the imagination or provide ideas for your projects. Better to go on the internet for help and information."
1,hard to get into.,"Not my cup of tea,but a book club recommended read. Very dark and repetitive plots. Mysterious and has the patina of Spain."
5,Wonderful Read,I was spell bound by the first few pages. What a descriptive and colorful writer. I wish he had 20 more.
2,Disappointing,"The only reason I'm giving this book 2 stars (rather than 1) is Carlos Ruiz Zafon's brilliant ability to turn a phrase. There were sentences in the book which were crafted SO deliciously well, I wanted to eat them for lunch! ;0)However, the story line is desperately tragic. If you are looking for a treatise on ""How to live a life completely out of God's will, and die, often times young, in utter despair,"" this is the book for you."
4,Really Liked it!!,"I really enjoyed this book. The mystery of it all, wondering about this mysterious author Carax right along with Daniel. The characters in this book are just wonderful from all the main characters to the characters like the dirty old man in the ""asylum/old folk's home"", characters that have a way of staying with you. The character of Fumero was such a creep/psychopath talk about holding a grudge.I enjoy books about books and this one was no exception. It is historical fiction in my mind although it is set in the 20th century.If you enjoyed People of the Book I think you'll like this one too even though they are very different they have a similar ""feel""."
4,"Very good story, but too long","This book started so well I thought I had found a masterpiece, however, it got rather boring in the middle and finished quite well.It was a good story and the characters were very well-drawn. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone with a good imagination"
3,Film noir,"It read like a European film - with subtitles. Very entertaining, as a friend promised... but I just couldn't help wishing I could read Spanish so I could enjoy the book in all its original splendour.Given Lucia Graves (found out she was Robert Graves's daughter from wikipedia) did a fair job of capturing the film noir glory of Zafon's storytelling and layered narratives, I couldn't help but cringe at the awkward turn of phrase that probably originated from some beautiful Spanish idioms, especially when a character says something clever or insightfully humorous...Still a nice book to read for its cinematic leanings... (is a movie out already?). A cemetery of books, a young boy protecting the only copy of an elusive author's book, whose works are strangely sought after and burnt by one of the characters in the book... loss of innocence, childhood friendships turned awry, crush on a blind girl, incest, jealousy, etc, all the ingredients of a gripping story."
5,Wonderful gothic novel,"I bought this book for our book club (and also on the recommendation of my sister who loved it). The book has multiple stories running at different times in Spanish history, and more than one person I know has had to make a list of characters as it can get rather confusing. That being said.....The writing is wonderfully descriptive, and the characters are deep and complicated. It is a love story and a mystery and a piece of history all wrapped in one package. This was one of the rare books that I forced myself to read slowly as to savor every word and image. I have already lent out my copy to a friend."
2,Disappointing,"Very simply when you read the back cover about the ""cemetery of lost books"" and about the mysteries surrounding the book in question you are deliberately led to believe that there will be something at least a bit supernatural involved in the story. It turns out to just be a rather unimaginative and overlong love story with too many plot twists and really nothing more. I felt deceived and disappointed, frankly."
4,A Wonderful Modern Gothic,"The reviewers who gave this book a poor rating obviously have no romance in their souls. This book is a wonderful piece of escapism that will leave you longing to stay behind and spend some more time with its' characters. Some parts are predictable, but so what? The pleasure of this book is in the way the story is told. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy."
4,Beautiful,"The Shadow of the Wind is a beautiful novel. It's beautifully written and i really enjoyed reading it. I first saw the book at Suria KL City Centre's Kinokuniya bookstore with the 'gem of the month-sticker' on it. I read the synopsis at the back and few first pages. Then i felt in love with it and just bought it. It is a gem and once a gem, it's always a gem"
4,Fun Read,"A very entertaining and engaging read. The book captures the feel of Barcelona, and has a pulpy, noir element to it that is enjoyable."
5,Best Book in my Book!,This is the best read for me in the last 5 years. Carlos Ruiz Zafon's command of the Spanish language(I have not read it in english) is a delight in and of itself. A really intriguing story that keeps you hooked from beginning to end. I want to take off and fly to Barcelona tonight and try to look for the cementary of lost books. Wouldn't it be thrilling to find it? Zafon's use of imagination leaves the reader wanting more. I was sad to finish this great story.
5,Wonderful story,This book was recommended by a few friends and finally I read it. It is every bit as good as they said.
2,couldn't finish it,"Angel's game was intriguing... the copy was so superbly edited... it was amazing to read. The story, however was confusing. This book was much worse. The editing and writing was much more cumberous, without even the hint of a story to plague it. Just moody Spainish drinking and walking... after 1/2 way thru hoping it would get better, I just stopped."
2,Must have been lost in translation!,Just finished this book after starting it over 4 months ago. That's how captivating it is. The good reviews for this book are a bit off.
2,A bit boring,This book couldn't keep my interest and was a bit long. Not one I'd recommend. Didn't need all the characters which became confusing.
5,Looking for a great book?,"An amazing story! It is so well written that I have ordered his other works for myself, and have recommended this book to my book club members, both male and female."
4,entertaining! straddles the line between popular and literary.,"This book was a fun read. It's kind of like Umberto Eco lite with a dash of Borges thrown in. It definitely has a cheez quality to it and is extremely sentimental, but to good effect because it actually caused me to squirt some tears at the end. The characters are all very melodramatic but it all fits in with the quality of the world he creates.I must say some of the scenes had me on the edge of my reading chair at times, so it is not without it's thrills. I would read this author again."
4,An intriguing love story in one of my favorite cities,I enjoyed the descriptive language used in the book. It made it easy to imagine how simple--and depending on the circumstances--cruel life could be in 1940's Barcelona. The characters were intriguing and the story had enough mystery to keep me turning pages deep into the night. The reveal between Julian and Penélope was a surprise. A great read even though some back-stories meandered a bit at times.
5,La Sombra del Viento,Este libro es fenomenal! Si pueden conseguir la edicion especial con soundtrack haganlo!! no saben lo que se pierden!!
5,This book will crack you out...,"So it was recommended to me by my fiancee who loved the book so I figured I'd give it a try. It turns out this is probably one of the 5 best novels I've ever read. It's simply an incredible book with beautiful writing, amazingly crafted story and just so F-ing good that it had me cracked out each night for 3 days while I tried to put it down. It's on par with Victor Hugo, Garcia Marquez, etc. and some of the finest writing ever. It's hard to describe but it's about as intense a novel as you'll read.I'm not going to give the story away, but go get the book. If you're looking for a masterpiece, this is it. This book is going to be an instant legend. It's his first novel and I can't imagine how Zafon can follow it up."
4,A wonderful summer book or one for a long plane ride,"A Catalan version of a Robert Goddard mystery set in pre War Barcelona; full bodied characters, creepy houses, many explicit love affairs, an evil villain, an intriguing plot which parallels the young hero and then at the end turns back on itself. Who wouldn't want to catch the next flight to Barcelona after reading this book? Now that the author is in LA, when is movie coming out?"
2,How many more of these chessy things are they gonna make??,"This was too Chessy, I mean really awful, the Grind show is off MTV and it should be off video too. Save your money, Id rather watch paint dry than eric nies do another video."
1,DANCE FRUIT USA,"This dance video was fruit, I have the first one and this one is awful, eric nies is looking a little washed up, 15 minutes of fame are now up for this one. Buy the first one this one is too Fruit."
2,"Better for fun, but not for a serious workout..","Yes, this video is great if you like to dance and feel like messing around for a whole hour doing much of nothing but watching people dance.I agree the moves are original and sparked my interest at first, but there is no real workout involved here, no real sweating and no real cardio workout.If you're looking for a good workout to do at home, skip this one, it's a waste of time and money."
3,For the simple dancer,"I was a little reluctant to buy a 1998 tape in 2002 but it was on sale and it ended up being so worth it. Yes, the moves can be a little difficult at first but if you love to dance, the 50 mins FLEW by. Some reviews say it doesnt 'work you out' but you have to intensify it yourself but doing the moves at tempo speed and trust me, if you dont break out into a sweat, something's wrong on your end. I didnt buy this video for Erik Nies, I bought it so I dont have to hear people yelling 1-2-3-4 at music that sometimes sounds like background porn music. I love this video and intend to do it as often as possible. The music is great if you are into dancing club music. Just make the most of it!"
1,not a good one from MTV this time,"this tape is a previous viewer said, they goof off and the steps are somewhat silly and not really target toning or cardio for that matter. when the instructor throws her hand in the air, she really just throws them in all directions and starts laughing and being goofy. it;s like they are just seeing who is prettier or who has the hottest moves, not a workout at all. quite dissapoiting since i have the Grind and it is awesome. now that does give you a workout. i don't recommend this tape, buy the Grind instead"
1,Might Be Some Hope???,Everything you read about this unit is true...avoid it like the plague. I did get some good news when I called cust service today. They are shipping me a brand new unit free of charge. When I asked if I had to return the old one first they said that I didn't have to return it at all. They obviously recognized that it is a complete set of junk as they told me to throw away the old one entirely as it is not compatible with the new one and its new circuitry.I also found it strange that I didn't have to do anything as far as provide a receipt or proof of purchase. Sounds like they have completely given up on this item and are starting from scratch. So if you have one of these call customer service. Even if the new one works I don't think I would pay money for it again. Apparently the old model is still on shelves in stores and online so wait a couple of months before you even consider.
1,Customer Support.....NOT!!!,I have tried three of these units and none of them work for more than three weeks. My last one i finally called Chaney Instruments customer service. Bad move. That was in June 07 and I still don't have a new unit. I have been waiting for a new one longer that owned any of them. Worst weather unit I have ever seen.
1,IT'S A DUD!,"When it was brand new, my unit performerd poorly; wind reading never went above four mph, humidity was completely inaccurate. In one year's time,it went even further downhill from there. This is one of the more expensive 'contributions' that I've made to my recycling bin."
3,Not Hot Enough,"I bought this model based upon the reviews here. Its a good looking machine and easy to operate. Unfortunately, the coffeeisn't hot enough immediately upon brewing. The temperature ofthe first one I had was about 165. I called the Braun service center to see what the specs for temperature was and was told, 176. So, I assumed the one I had was defective and exchanged it. The second one had the same problem. Because other than the temperature issue I really liked the model, I called a Braun repair service to see if they could adjust the thermostat and they said no, but that Braun machines were typically in the low160's, but that Krups were in the mid 170's."
4,"Great tasting coffee that is warm, not hot","We love our Braun Thermal Coffeemaker, just be ready to microwave your coffee after you pour a cup to get it to the desired hot temperature. The instructions say to fill the stainless steel carafe with hot water to pre-heat it before making coffee, but that is last thing we want to do early in the morning. So, we accept great tasting coffee that needs a little microwave ""boost.""On the plus side, if the coffee sits for a couple of hours, it still stays warm in the carafe and never has that burned taste we were used to with our old coffee maker."
4,Braun KF600 great for my needs,"When my Krups coffee pot began to fail me, I researched for a replacement. I wanted a simple thermal coffee maker with no frills. I like to grind my beans just prior to making coffee, so I didn't need a timer.I wanted a thermal carafe, this one works much better if you fill pot with hot water to preheat while you are filling the water reservoir. I had read several reviews that complained of leaking during the brewing process - I figured out quickly that it was because the measure on the side of the water reservoir was a little too generous for the 10 cup pot - I was used to a 12 cup pot. So I started filling it to just below the 10 cup mark and it made excellent coffee with no spillage.I am happy with my purchase. I like being able to grab a cup before it is finished with the entire pot. And when company is around (like during the holidays) I just bought an extra cheap carafe to have so I can brew a second pot while everyone is consuming the first."
2,NOT a 10 cup coffee maker...,"If you need a 10 cup coffee maker DO NOT purchase this one! Although the box, the description and even the water resevoir claim that this unit makes 10 cups of coffee, it does not. I called the Braun customer service number and the woman agreed with me - she said although the water resevoir takes 10 cups, the coffee grounds ""keep"" about a cup and a half (oh and by the way, they measure in EUROPEAN CUPS, not AMERICAN CUPS). OKAAAAY, I don't really care of the resevoir takes 25 cups - I want to make 10 cups OF COFFEE. As far as I'm concerned they are totally misleading people. I've been buying coffee makers for years and I do not need a lesson in coffee ground water retention. This may make a good cup of coffee - but keep in mind it makes EIGHT cups, not the advertised ten."
4,Braun KF600 Impressions Coffee Maker,Overall we're pleased with the quality of the coffee maker. The coffee is very hot when it's finished brewing. The burner stays on for about 17 minutes then automatically turns off. The coffee inside stays hot for at least 45 minutes. The size of the coffee maker is not overpowering so it doesn't take up a lot of counter space. It's extremely simple to use.
2,Steer clear of this one.,"After considerable research, I purchased this model. I do like the fact that it's simple to operate and doesn't have the gadgetry of other coffee makers. Otherwise, it does not make HOT coffee like I get from Starbucks. If you want hot coffee, consider a BUNN."
2,Not that impressed,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to buy this coffeemaker.My broken $9 Coffemaker (Mr. Coffee) was brewing better and tasty (hot) coffee. With Braun KF600 I am not getting same hot coffe feeling, I like very hot coffee, just like I get from Starbucks.Although it says 10-cup, it can make up to 4 mugs of coffee, if you have 5 people in the house, re-brew."
1,"NOT HOT, TOO NOISY, STEAM SPUTTERER","HAVING ENJOYED BRAUN FLAVOR SELECT PRODUCTS FOR YEARS, I JUMPED AT THE CHANCE TO BUY THEIR FIRST THERMAL CARAFE STAINLESS STEEL COFFEEMAKER LAST YEAR. BAD DECISION. FROM THE BEGINNING,IT MADE BELCHING NOISES WHILE BREWING EVEN 3 CUPS AND EXCESS STEAM MADE THE COVER WET. ON TOP OF THAT,I FOUND THE THERMAL CARAFE DID NOT KEEP COFFEE ANY HOTTER THAN REGULAR GLASS CARAFE. I CALLED BRAUN BUT THEY WOULD NOT REFUND OR EXCHANGE FOR ANOTHER COFFEEMAKER. THEY DID OFFER TO REPAIR IT IF I WOULD SHIP IT TO AUTHORIZED CENTER. NO THANKS AS THERE ARE TOO MANY THINGS WRONG WITH IT. TODAY, I ORDERED THE WELL RATED CUISINART 1200 STAINLESS AND BLACK COFFEEMAKER. I WILL REPORT ON THAT AFTER A FEW MONTHS."
3,"An okay coffee maker, less than expected","The on button does not stay ""on"" for long. The coffee ends up getting cold in the thermal carafe, which really isn't that thermal. Looks nice, but doesn't function great. The taste of the coffee is okay though, when it is hot. The Brita filters that come with the coffee maker are, in my experience, hard to find. In ordering them on Amazon, there was a three week wait for them. Keep this in mind as the filters only have a two month lifespan."
2,dosen't keep coffee hot,"I really wish I bought a different model. I'm very disappointed with this Braun. It brews okay, and has a nice, clean, simple design. But I purchased this Braun specifically because I thought it would be nice to have a second cup of coffee mid-morning, without brewing again or running to Starbucks. Unfortunately, this carafe doesn't do the trick. In fact, the coffee is already cooling by the time I get up about a half-hour after my husband. I like hot coffee because I add milk. This is just warm coffee, even though my husband preheats the carafe with hot water before brewing (and who needs that extra step during the morning rush anyway?!). I suspect the lid design might be partially to blame. In reading a description of other coffeemakers I see that some carafe lids screw on tightly; this isn't so tight."
4,it's okay,"After breaking two glass pots over six months, I decided to go for a thermal pot. So I got what I wanted from that, and so far haven't had any other problems. However, there are some cons to this machine. The filter container doesn't fit super closely, and produces a bit of steam while brewing. The coffee pot says 10 cups, but like most pots, it's cup and the average person's cup is not equal. I fill it to 5 cups and get two mugs. The opening of the pot is narrow, so it's impossible to clean properly without a brush. I tend to drink my coffee right after it's brewed, and the first cup is hot, but the second, which I have may 20 minutes after brewing has cooled a little...so I can see how some say the thermal pot isn't so thermal. I know it sounds like a lot of cons, but to me it's small stuff, and compared reviews of the other coffee makers with a thermal pot it's nothing. Ultimately, it makes coffee and I can't break the pot so I'm satisfied."
3,Braun vs: Hamilton Beach,I purchased the Braun Coffee Maker because of the reviews on this site and because my old Hamilton Beach carafe broke. The Hamilton Beach makes a more flavorful and tastefull cup of coffee in my opinion. Both are easy to use. The Braun's carafe is shaped in a way that you can't clean it with your hand or a cloth. You have to get some special kind of spounge with a handle to swab it. The Braun looks good on the counter top. But it's just so-so when it comes to making a good tasting cup of coffee.
5,Great coffeemaker,"I just replaced my Krups which I had for many years with the Braun KF600. It makes a great cup of coffee. I grind my own beans each morning. The taste and aroma is outstanding. It has no bells and whistles, but if you can do without them, I would highly recommend this product."
4,Hot Coffee all day,"This is a great coffee maker & the carafe really keeps the coffee warm for a very long time(as long as you remove it from the machine) The permanent filter basket is convienent - no more annoying filters. My sister liked mine so much, she bought one too."
5,Works well for me,This coffee system is pretty much what I was looking for. Not a lot of bells and whistles--no irritating alarm when the coffee is done brewing. The burner turns off after 17 minutes and the thermal carafe keeps the coffee warm. It's easy to clean too. I would buy it again.
5,great coffeemaker,"I had a hard time deciding what thermal coffeemaker to buy after reading the reviews. This was a great purchase. I agree with some other reviewers that the water fill line is on the wrong side but that is because of my kitchen layout. I also stopped using the gold filter because I was ending up with particles/sludge at the bottom of my cup. Paper filter, problem solved. I also like that it is compact in size yet holds as much as my old super tall coffeemaker."
3,Braun Cofeemaker,This is a beautiful coffee maker very stilish but unfortunately it is not washmachine safe....I know the coffee machines are not supposed to be put i nthe dishwasher but sometimes it would be helpful...........
5,Great coffeemaker,I absolutely love this product! I bought it a couple of months ago and have had no problems at all. We make at least 2 pots a day. The coffee stays hot for at least 3 hours and warm for up to 5 hours. I love the fact that there is no heating element.
1,Cold Coffee,"This looks like a great coffee maker, but unfortunately, unless you make the maximum 10 cups each time you use it, the stainless steel carafe cools the coffee to a lukewarm, tepid temperature. The manufacturer suggests that you warm the carafe by running hot water over it before use. Not a very convenient method to get a decent cup of coffee. I advise shoppers to select a different brand."
1,Very disappointed,I have to say I am very unhappy with this coffeemaker. It makes horrible coffee that stays semi-hot for a few minutes and quickly turns to lukewarm. I have tried pre-warming the thermal carafe but it doesn't seem to make a difference.
3,So far OK,"We've had this about a month now. Brews fine coffee quickly. The stainless pot does keep the coffee hot for a long time. Only two complaints: the unremovable plastic top of the pot makes it difficult to clean. Would much prefer a smooth inner surface. Also, you can't open the grounds container while it's brewing, since it swings out to the side."
3,Braun KF600 Impressions 10-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker,"Excellent coffee maker, keeps coffee warm. You need to plan on purchasing water filters on regular basis and the coffee maker is extremely loud when perking."
3,Braun Coffe Maker,We have been pleased with this coffeemaker however it does not make a full ten cups of coffee. The thermal carafe is a little small but it does keep the coffee hot for hours.
3,It's fun and very well done but not inspiring.,"I know no one's going to agree with my review but I've had six months to listen to this album now and I just can't get into it the way I enjoy the other Hiromi albums.It's fun to listen to and I'm not questioning the tremendous talent of the artists on this album. But this album seems to lack the emotional intensity I've come to expect from them. I can't find on this album the sense of ""purpose"" you feel in such songs from previous albums as Green Tea Farm, Love and Laughter, Brain, Another Mind, Legend of the Purple Valley, Music for Three-Piece Orchestra.The melodies just aren't memorable or meaningful, the harmonies get pretty repetitive in too many places. But the songs are of course very technically challenging and executed very well. I think on an artistic level it's not totally fair to compare previous work to new work, but the fact remains I own 4 Hiromi albums and only one of them I never listen to anymore."
5,Where has Hiromi been all my life?,"Fantastic recording! The music speaks directly to me and I suspect a great many others. It takes classic fusion and moves it foreward a generation or two. Best recording of 2007. I quite by accident checked this out from my local library. I was not familiar with this artist or her music. After one play I immediately sought out the SACD for purchase and I will never part with it. Hiromi is hot and on fire, her mind complex and her hands are all over the keyboard. No wonder everyone wants her to be on their recordings. She is a breath of fresh air. All the other musicians on this are at the top of their game as well. Please purchase this recording immediately. Play it; learn it and you can't help but love it. Also, there is a live concert DVD of these musicians performing these songs that must be experienced. Brilliantly conceived and expertly executed! Well done Hiromi! Where have you been all my life?"
3,Great... when it actually works,"Like other reviewers have mentioned this rounder leaves a ""step"" if you aren't careful but since it's easy to align and punch upside down the step is easy to avoid. The problem I ran into is when trying to punch anything thicker than cardstock the rounder jams and it takes some effort to get it working again. This is the first rounder I've tried so I'm not sure what other ones on the market are like but I'm a bit disappointed that I can't round the edges of laminated pictures because it will jam."
5,A great corner rounder,"I bought this even though a lot of the reviews for it are negative, but I love it! It works great, I haven't had any problems with it.The only time it didn't work very well was when I used it on light weight graph paper, every other kind of paper I used it on it was a success."
2,Too inconsistent for my needs,"I bought this thinking I could use it for my design work, presentations, etc. I'm lucky if I get a perfect corner 1 out of 4 tries. There's almost always a rough spot or something that is unrepairable unless you recut it. It cuts fine, just tough to get it aligned perfectly in the 90 so you don't end up with odd little edges. Maybe had it been larger so you could really wedge the corner up in there, it would be more accurate. I'll keep messing with it, but until now, not a fan..."
4,Corner guide is a huge plus.,"This corner punch does what it's supposed to. It fortunately includes a corner guide so the corner is centered perfectly, but take care to insert and hold the corner carefully as it's easy for it to wiggle just enough to mess up the edge."
1,Didn't work,I bought this to make rounded corners on laminated paper. It just plain didn't work. Jammed the first time. I ended up throwing it out.
4,"AMAZING, GR8!!!!!","This is an amazing product. I would reccomend this to anyone. I've had it for 5 months now and its working just as well as when i got it. There are only 2 cons: the headphones (which are easy to deal with) and the software (which has great instructions but a little hard to work the playlist at first but then you get used to it). Otherwise, it is one of the best products for your money."
2,Not bad...initially.,"My player worked well for the first 2 months. Unfortunately, I also had a lot of difficulty with my computer recognizing my player due to driver problems. Dealing with Rio/Sonic Blue customer service is a joke. I had to pay...just to speak to a technician and, at the end of the session, NOTHING was resolved. I would seriously consider another player."
1,junk,Find something else -- software is not intuitive and requires a lot of manipulation to organize music. Hardware is just as bad -- mine lasted three months before a complete crash.
1,worst experience ever,"Never buy any product from rio ever, this is a horible product and I couldn't get anyone to tell me how to get it to work. I was absolutly horrible"
2,Great when it works!!,"I loved this PSA player, and then it stopped working two weeks after I received it. The computer software could not recognize the player and made changing the music impossible. Also, the player stopped working. I found out, dealing with Sonic Blue customer service is a NIGHTMARE. It looks as if I MAY get a new player 1 to 1.5 months after I returned it due to lack of stock on their part. The player itself was sleek, and easy to use, buteats batteries fast. Rechargeables are needed to make it cost effective. All in all, the player is a good design, Sonis Blue and their warranty/customer service get a zero for their help and support."
2,"Loved it for a year, broke down week after warranty","For the past year I have completely loved having this MP3 player to take to the gym, on my commute, etc. The arm band was great for working out and the remote allowed me to put the player in my coat pocket or purse when commuting. Unfortunately, I had a lot of problems with it:3 months: The flimsy belt clip broke5 months: The remote's LCD screen stopped working1 year: The player could no longer be recognized by my computer nor could it play the music already downloaded. It was determined that the player was no longer functional.Additionally, sometime in the last couple of months while trying to dowload music to the player I would recieve an application error or the program would simply hang.The software itself is horrible and customer support is a bit surly."
2,Basic Exercises,Older video with basic back exercises which can be found for free in several internet locations for little or no charge. I guess there is no madic solution for back pain.
5,good view,"Bette Midler shines in ""Stella"". This is one of her great performances. It is very heartwarming and anyone can relate to it.The entire cast is excellent! Kudos!"
5,Amazing truth,Brilliant book for all of you who are concerned about your health and how to stay healthy in such a common sense and easy way. It's all about protein and I give Dr. David Heber my full house of stars!
2,The worst diet I have EVER tried!,I bought this book and tried the diet. I found the high protein shakes to be disgusting and bad tasting. I had heard good things about the L.A. Shape Diet from friends who had tried the diet but they were most definetly wrong. The only people who should go on this diet are people who enjoy eating horrible food. Also the high protein shakes were not filling at all. I reccomend buying any diet book BUT this.
3,An OK Little System,"I have had one of these for about two years as the system in our kitchen. Since we play music during most meals, it gets much use. The overall sound is pretty good, but the cassette player stopped working after about nine months. I used to be a stereo salesman, so I know about cleaning a cassette deck. I recommend it if you want to play CD's. I have not used the radio much, but when I have it seems to pull in the stations well."
5,Excellent Wire Stripper,"I bought this crimper for use in wiring a home theater. Once I figured out how to use the crimper it made short work of the job. Zero broken strands, yielding nice, clean, even stripped ends for the banana plugs. I've had probably 5-6 wire strippers before, but this tool was clearly superior. I highly recommend this excellent tool."
3,Easy read,"This was an easy read but pretty slow in the beginning. I didn't get into it until midway through the book, but I enjoyed the way the story is told through the eyes of Griet. I disliked the ending, and thought the story should have ended earlier.I have also seen the movie, which misses a lot of the story that Chevalier creates, but the ending of the movie is the way I would have preferred the book ending."
2,Not bad,"This was neither deep nor meaningful, but it was entertaining. The author did a good job of taking you into the character and setting - it felt like you were there. In short, the main character and setting were well done, the plot was thin. Still, a worthwhile beach book."
3,"Good, But Not Great","This book got lots of good reviews, but I didn't think that it was all that great. Tracy Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring, was a fun read, but i didnt like that lack of emotional involvement. I read it, and i was just begging for more depth and intensity, but it was just too shallow.Griet is a girl hired to work for The Famous Painter Vermeer under the instruction of his wife. She starts cleaning his studio, then eventually she helps him mix colors. Soon she is helping him more with out Catharina's, his jealous wife's knowledge.Whenever the painter Vermeer and Griet were together, you could kind of feel there might be some feelings, but i guess it was too subtle, because i didnt know what was happening with them. This book was a fun read, but nothing to lose yourself in."
3,mixed.,"Tracy Chevalier writes books that are easy to read. This one moves a little slower than the Angels book; both took some time to get going. The momentum can be rough, and her writing does not have any striking originality. but she did pick a good subject for sure. She has a knack for recreating periods (or what we think is a recreation of a period), so for one's interest in history, these books are good. There's also a feminist slant which is of interest. She does tend to stack her story with unpleasant characters. It's not brilliant writing for sure, but she gets an A for concept."
4,A Great Easy Read,"I enjoyed this book very much because of the simplicity of the authors writing. It was easy to read, very discriptive and an image of Holland, which is not usually written about. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those who are interested in art."
3,Visually superior to the literary effect,"I kept looking at the lovely cover photo of the painting of the title character and found it far more interesting than the book. The tale itself was so less rich and complete that I could not find it in any way beguiling. The story's one fact that has been bandied about is the question of the use of an early camera by the painter. The plot, however, the maid's ascendency and the reaction of Vermeer's oft-pregnant wife, failed, I felt, to speak to the innocence and the enormous warmth of the painter and the subject.The relative lack of historical details that would seem 'different' than our own styles of talking and thinking, was, for my purposes, too vast. After all, it was the 1600's, and yet the incidental aspects of life seemed as though they were all too modern. Not, something I would recommend."
4,Where paint meets pages,"How delightful it was to spend a dreary afternoon lost among the sloping streets and shimmering canals of Delft with Griet! I found this book to be a delightful meld of the literary and the artistic world, as Chevalier ""paints"" a colorful history of a somewhat exasperating girl. I admit, at first I was a bit trepidatious of reading a book that dealt with painting, and Vermeer's paintings at that, in a literary form. How was the author going to capture the incredible skill, and beauty of a painting with words? I extend my congratulations, for Ms. Chevalier did just that. Somehow, she managed to meld the words into a medium that conveyed artistic flair, perhaps grinding her ingredients just as Greit did, into a paint that she splashed on the pages. Her descriptions of Delft, and the houses surrounding the canal I found to be a surprisingly perfect setting for this story. I recommend this quick, but engaging read for a cold day and a hot cup of tea."
3,an ok read,"I picked up this book because I had read other books by this author and enjoyed them. THis book was the same--a very fast read, easy, if somewhat implausible story, and an interesting story idea.Vermeer's household hires a new maid, Griet, to clean his studio and help around the house. Griet has ""wide-set eyes"" that seem to attract attention from everyone. Vermeer becomes entranced with having her sit for him for a portrait--""Girl with Pearl Earring.""This is a story that shows what might have happened, or what moved Vermeer to paint this picture. It's ok, but not spectacular."
2,Over-rated,"The book has a simple structure and there is nothing new or exciting in the story. This is the kind of book you should read on a plane ride but don't expect anything deep, meaningful or original."
2,A Good Example of Bad Writing,"Not only is this book pretentious and poorly written, it's dull. The author tries desperately to be blunt and sound truthful, but she basically just sounds forced and stylized. When she tries to be surprising, I just find myself irritated. The overall feel of this book is that of an amateur playing with someone else's characters - you read it but dismiss it as arbitrary and temporary. Every few sentences she remembers she's supposed to be sounding poetic and throws in a sentence like 'She said his name like cinnamon on her tongue' (I'm paraphrasing here.) I ask you!"
2,A Silly Book,"Simplistic narrative, cardboard thin characters, silly soap-opera plot. If you never finished high school, this might pass for high culture, otherwise give it a pass."
1,Not what I thought it was going to be,"I really did not enjoy this book. While it started off okay, I really found it dragging. After a while I wasn't even excited to read it anymore. I really disliked the main character which may be one reason. It moved too slowly and there wasn't enough action. Don't waste your money."
1,Eclectic Garbage,"A book full of modern sentiments but set in the 17th Century. Instead of wasting time reading someone's perceptions of an artist living in that age, it would be much more enriching to read Vasari's ""Lives of the Artists"" written in the days of Michelangelo by the architect who knew Michelangelo and other artists personally. As for romance, whatever occurs in this story can hardly be called that--especially by the standards of the 17th Century. Reading a modern writer's description of the lustful fantasies of an unrestrained teenage maid in that century is a sheer waste of time."
2,Disappointing,"Perhaps I delved into this book with overblown expectations. Or perhaps the author intended to write a simplistic love story rather than tackle the complexity and depth of the art. Whichever the case, I was very disappointed with ""Girl with a Pearl Earring."" Vermeer's ""Girl"" is one of my favorite paintings, so I was thrilled to hear that someone had written a novel about it. Unfortunately, Ms. Chevalier's girl does not have the depth of character that I imagine the girl in the portrait to have. Every character in the book, including Vermeer, seems so one-dimensional that I had a hard time sympathizing with any of them. I do appreciate Ms. Chevalier's understanding of the Dutch and think that her description of Delft did merit a couple of stars. But as a documentary of Dutch life and culture in the 17th century, I much preferred reading Simon Schama's Embarrassment of Riches."
1,P-P-P-l-e-e-e-e-a-s-e,My daughter wrote better short stories in college.There was no meat here. Character development is empty. This beautiful time in history never became 'real'. Erotic? Show me the page.Just sorry I bought this book. It goes to secondhand. Disappointing.
4,An Artist's Description,"Normally, historical fiction does not interest me but this book gave you a close look into an artist's life. The way the artist went about his paintings fascinated me. I will never look at Vermeer's paintings the same. This is also a book about a progressive 16 yr. old girl growing up. By the end of the novel she becomes much more opinionated, outspoken, and aware of her sexuality. I was suprised at the importance she put on her hair and what it meant. I love books that open your eyes to a different way of life and Girl with a Pearl Earring did that for me. Chevalier webbed together an array of personalities and history beautifully. She really did her homework."
3,A memorable story despite it's lack of drive,"I have to say, this book has stayed with me, though I can't explain why. As it pertains to Vermeer, it is largely invention, and yet I did come away feeling like I identified with him a little. I appreciated the subtleties in the relationship between the heroine and the artist, the complexities of a girl in her position and during her time. I felt Chevalier painted the setting well, though I found Griet a bit difficult to sympathize with. Overall, I felt it a bit over-hyped. It is, in some ways, very well painted, a story well told, but it lacks complexity, and drive. I did feel, however, that it was a far greater accomplishment artistically than was Burning Bright."
3,plausible by predictable,"Tracy Chevalier's novel is a fictitious background story for Johannes Vermeer's famous painting. The tale is plausible enough, told from the perspective of the girl in the painting. Griet is a teenager in 1664 who becomes a maid in the service of Vermeer's family, but the artist recognizes when he meets her that she is a good observer of color. She has placed her chopped vegetables in the shape of pie wedges, so that adjacent colors in the wheel are not similar. The prose is unpretentious and straightforward, evocative of the well-mannered Griet, making this book a quick read. I thought it rather predictable, especially with regard to the hurtful mischief that Vermeer's daughter Cornelia stirs up and the eventual role that Griet earns as Vermeer's assistant. Of course, we know from the outset that he will paint her, and it was handy to have a photo of the painting on the cover as a reference."
4,As Solid & Beautiful As The Movie,"This was another case in which the book and the movie (which I saw first) both met expectations, which is quite a compliment. The movie is stunning in its cinematography and simplicity but the book was just as good, if not better.Tracy Chevalier ""paints"" a picture with her prose as eloquently as the photographers did in the subsequent movie. It might sound like a reviewer's cliche, but you do feel ""like you are there."" In this case, ""there"" is 17th century Holland, and in the home of famous painter Johannes Vermeer.It's one of those rare cases where I would recommend seeing the film first. You then have a portrait in your mind of the main figures and the picturesque area. Since, admittedly, the film was slow-moving, I was worried the book might be dry....but it wasn't. It was fascinating."
5,The girl with a Pearl Earring.,This book was recommended to Me . It was Wonderful and Very Believable!! I Give it an A++. I also Recommend this Great Book.
5,Wow!,"This book was the way I discovered one of my favorite authors, Tracy Chevalier. I was left literally speechless by her blunt, yet beautiful writing style that kept me reading and reading. Set in the seveneenth century, this engrossing novel explores the mysterious origins of the painting, ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" and the heart of a young maid named Griet. I found myself transfixed by Chevalier's way of conecting the readers slowly and carefully to her interesting and unique characters, and the novel maintained my interest throughout its entirety, leaving me with a strange, empty feeling when I was through. I strongly reccomend lovers of historical fiction, romance, and good writing to read this story."
5,Her Best Work,"I've read all of Chevalier's books, and this is by far her best work. It's a real page turner - I finished it in one night!"
5,Enchanting,Although this book starts slowly( the first 15 pages) it quickly becomes enthrawling. After I read it I went out and found a book of Vermeer's paintings. It was wonderful to see the painting and recognize things from the book. The dialoge is wonderful and the book is beautifully written. I strongly suggest you read it.
2,DULL,"What a great concept--taking a breathtakingly beautiful painting and giving it life! I couldn't wait to read about this lovely girl with the pearl earring. What a disappointment, what a bore!Much has been written about the author's portayal of a 17th century Dutch household. True, there's historical information that's interesting, but it was like reading non-fiction, not a novel with well-developed characters and an intriquing story. The prose was tedious, the style undistinguished.Nothing about the book really drew me in, except the cover--I found myself looking back often, gazing upon that beautiful face and wondering what really was behind the pearl earring. Maybe there's a book in it."
3,Not as good as hype,"I read this book back in April as part of a book group; I don't know if I would have picked it up otherwise, being naturally contrary and suspicious of success. The writing is good, and the plot is O.K., but about halfway through it started to lose me, enough so that I forgot to read the last chapter and didn't notice until several days later, when I was putting it away. Griet's attempts to stifle her emotions in various scenes seem to have the same stultifying effect on the entire atmosphere of the novel. (Except, of course, for my wanting to kill the eldest child of the house, who is truly a little snot.) For those wanting a far more entertaining fictional account of Holland at about the same time, I wholeheartedly recommend _Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister_ by Gregory Maguire."
2,Compelled and disappointed...,"Though not a complete waste of time, this book was definitely more hype than substance. I felt the novel lacked any real constructive qualities. The narration was lacking, though the story was definitely interesting. I wish the narration had been executed with a more interesting and informative style. The characters, including the main character seem unrealistic. The book is interesting if only for the basic plot. Apart from that, the quality of the text is poor.It is too bad the author didn't spend as much time on her novel as the Vermeer did on his portrait."
2,Thoroughly mediocre,"Unlike Vermeer who obviously had talent, I am hard pressed to believe that this author has produced a best seller. I truly wanted to like this novel,(as it was a selection by my bookclub), alas I did not. My reasons for disliking it are simple; it is terribly dull. I kept waiting for something to happen (it never does). The characters are one dimentional at best, and our muse Griet would appear to be the most amazing and accomplished teenager to have ever lived. At the tender age of 16 she knows everything about running a large household, raising children, manipulating the mature women of the house, fending off the advances of men, and in case that wasn't enough she's giving art tips to the master himself, um sure... that's plausible. While the premise of this book was fascinating the execution certainly was not. The best thing about this novel?... the cover art!!"
2,art,"This book was recommended by a friend. The story never captured my imagination, or even got very interesting to me. Nothing much happened outside the head of a young girl servant."
3,This book never made me care about the girl with the earring,"I never finished this book. I made it about 3\4's of the way through tedious descriptions of every day life, washing and cleaning and a plague that swept through the opposite side of town and killed off some very unfleshed out characters that the protagonist knew well. The girl's character comes across frequently as cold and unsympathetic. I did find the descriptions of Vermeer and his art fascinating, but that was about as far as I got with it. I made myself read it when I had free time because I was trying to find out what everyone else was raving about. I would rather read a textbook about Vermeer than this woman's pale, watery interpretation. I realize that this sounds harsh, and this book probably just wasn't my cup of tea. Maybe it will be executed better in the movie when it is released."
5,Great Book,"I found this book to be incredibly enjoyable. The way that Tracy Chevalier brings the art work of the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer to life is amazing. Not only to you get to see the paintings vividly in your head but you also can understand the feelings of the characters. Griet is a young girl that is torn two ways, one of which she knows is wrong. She knows that there is a connection between her master and herself but at the same time realizes that nothing can ever happen between them. Then ther is her butcher boyfriend who, though he is a great man, is not what Griet wants in life. You watch her struggle as she works for the Vermeer family living only for the time in His study. It is a thrilling story about the hard truth of the 17th Century.I absolutly loved this book and would recommend it to anyone. I have never before had a book that gave me such amazing visual images."
5,A pleasure to read!,"Due to family misfortunes, 16 year old Griet becomes a maid in the house of Johannes Vermeer. Through her eyes we see all the different people in this family with their different agendas.Through time Griet becomes, not just a maid, but Vermeer's assistant, mixing colours for his paintings, and eventually his model.I disagree that the ending was sad, yes it was easily predictable, as it was shown throughout the book. Simply Griet needed an exit, and there was only one logical answer.I loved the descriptions of the paintings, and found myself turning back to the front cover of the book and studying it, time and time again."
3,It was intertaining,The book did not hold my interest. I enjoyed the view into the protestant - Catholic separation as well as a master - servant relationship but I found the pace of the book slow.
5,Combine them!!,"All of Doug Stone's songs put out were hits! I enjoy both albums, but both ""Greatest Hits Vol. 1"" and ""Super Hits"" should just be combined! That would be the ultimate greatest hits album. Theres only 10 songs on each cd, if combined, removing repeated tracks, there would be about 17...they really should!"
3,Ssssllllllllllloooowwwwww,"This book was required for my book club. Normally, I can read a 300 page book in about 4 days. This time it took me 2 weeks. I read the preceding reviews and I just don't get it. Although I loved when the author helps the reader to revisit the 70's, i was a bit disappointed overall. This book is very slow, it didn't pick up for me until almost 3 quarters into the book. Reading about a 9 year old little girl that takes care of her sickly father - is just about the gist of the entire book. I felt like I was just repeating the same chapter over and over again mingled with some other things. It is not choice reading for me and if it wasn't required reading, I definately would not have finished it."
4,I could never rate a Dylan album below 4,"This album is a disapointing mix. I have relegated it to collection status. If you're looking for a good Dylan mix, buy the 2-disc Greatest hits 2. I hate to say it, but it seems like they threw together a bunch of songs at random that don't flow and don't represent the magnificance of Dylan."
4,Brownsville Girl Kicks,"I've been listening to Dylan heavily for years and got this CD for Silvio (with the Dead). To my surprise one of the songs I'd never heard was Brownsville Girl...WOW what a cool song, riveting imagery including great allusions to an old Gregory Peck movie.Wonder if that comes from co-writer playwrite Sam Shepard. OK sure there are more essential Dylan discs but don't miss this one. Its amazing how an almost random sequencing and song selection work so well for Dylan here as well as on Biograph, and the first Bootleg series. Brownsville Girl Kicks !"
4,good book,Decent book. Has very good information regarding pistol shooting. Really no negatives concerning this book.
5,Excelente libro sobre el manejo táctico de la pistola,"Es un excelente libro sobre el manejo táctico de la pistola. Esta muy bien ilustrado, lo que facilita la comprensión del tema. solo hecho en falta más datos estadisticos que puedan servir de guía para conocer el avance en la PRÁCTICA de los conceptos, por lo demás esta muy bien. Lo recomiendo bastante."
1,Home-boy special,"Tactical Pistol Shooting is another FINE example of why you should never purchase any product with ""tactical"" in the name or description. It will be just fine if you want to gain enough knowledge to ride the testosterone special (reserved for those that think they know everything about guns simply because they are male).Specific example: Weapon Safety (P-49) ""Treat all weapons as though they are loaded, regardless of their condition"". On the surface that sounds good, but HOW . DO . YOU . DO . THAT? What specific steps do you take to accomplish that task? - - - Second example: Reloading; He tells you to keep the gun pointed in a safe direction but the pictures show him pointing the gun at people beside him.Not worth any where near the price charged."
3,It's ok.,"Do you spend a lot of time at the range and reading online forums and gun magazines about tactics and techniques? If so, this book will seem very introductory. You might pick up a couple useful tidbits, but most of it will be recapitulative. If you are a beginner, this book will do a great job at giving you a conscientious and serious mindset as well as some useful information on the mechanics of shooting. I think the reviews raised my expectations a little too high, but I did not regret the purchase. In my opinion it isn't worth the cover price of $25, but if you find it for less than $10, I would recommend it, especially if you are just starting out."
4,Great bag for a great price,"I bought this for my wife and she's very happy with it. The bag is well built, lightweight (before you put the ball in...) and rolls easily.Plenty of pockets and compartment, although i am still wondering what the purpose of the one on top is."
3,Book is great for the time it was written,"But it doesn't compare to the original series. It's like real life, only with dragons as pets. Left some loose ends open, too."
4,New Aquarium,"Used this in a new aquarium. Fish didn't die, so I guess it worked as advertised. I would use it again, but I don't have a lot of experience with keeping fish."
5,NO LONGER MAKING THIS GREAT PRODUCE,"As always with a great product a company thinks they need to improve on it. Well I have purchases the last of Merrick Senior and now I must find another food with low fat, low protein and vegetable to fit my loving Bernese Mountain Dog needs. Merrick products for Senior was an excellent dog food. Well balance, with just the right mixture of fresh chicken and vegetable mixed into their dry dog food. Merrick please take my advise and return to the orginal recipe."
2,You will HATE the kid!,"There's good reason A Mother's Prayer isn't on DVD, and can be purchased on VHS for less than $5. It's not a very good movie. The dialogue and acting are pretty uneven, and it seems like there wasn't enough rehearsal. This is apparent when seasoned actors like Kate Nelligan and Bruce Dern were on screen. They seem to take it in stride, delivering professional performances that put most of the others to shame. Linda Hamilton is okay, but you will HATE the obnoxious kid!!! Bad writing / direction may've been partly to blame, but I hope NEVER to see Noah Fleiss in ANYTHING again."
4,Best approach on model building,"This is by far one of the best introduction to Resource Planning available. Its holistic approach to model building is treated in an original context of problem solving that goes beyond traditional operational research texts.Obviously written in an era where pc were not available, I would encourage an actualization with some observations on Theory of Constraints."
5,One of my favorites as a child (I am over 40),I read it to my children and they love it.I think it is out of print.
5,Beautiful tablecloth with piping aroun he edge.,"Exceeded my expectations. Thick, satin material and very nice cord piping finish to the edge. Washed nicely without many wrinkles."
5,My preschooler loves these tapes!,I remember having a record of Winne-the-Pooh stories that I listened to over and over as a child. And Charles Kuralt's narration of these beloved stories brings it all back for me and creates a wonderful childhood memory for my preschooler who begs for this tape all the time.Charles Kuralt did a superb job bringing these stories to life.
1,One more complaint about e-book cost,"So this is just one more complaint about the cost of the Kindle e-book version of Winnie the Pooh. I love this book and would love to have it on my Kindle, but at this price? No way. Hey, Publisher, get real. Five stars for the book; Minus 20 stars for the e-book price."
2,"Awesome boat, but didn't last long","My son only used this about 5 times before this died. I am not sure if the motor gave out or what, but the battery still works fine and the boat won't work. We bought this for his end of the school year gift to play with in the pool all summer and he hardly got to use it. Was fun while it worked:("
4,OK for Price-Works in Water ONLY.,"Item was shipped/delivered within a few days. Shipping box marked 'Handle w/Care' arrived in perfect condition. Subj patrol boat quality is FAIR-detailing toy level. Parts, such as, railing do not fit (slight sanding helped) into deck mounts, motor test button does not work, response time to RC control delayed, however overall performance, entertainment value WONDERFUL-children really love it. Love the interior light detail that enhances appearance in evening pool play. Summary-Worth $40+- cost... BUT-BE SURE TO PUT IN POOL/TUB/WATER BEFORE RETURNING-BOAT ONLY WORKS IN WATER... Have FUN-Hope boat lasts at least thru Summer..."
3,remote control boat,"Was listed with a shipping weight of 20lbs. Probably weighs a pound. Instructions are only on the box and are poorly written. The boat seems to be ok, but we've only tried it once. Definitely not for use if the water is a little rough. Will know more once my grandchildren arrive and use it."
3,had some issues,had to return it due to propeller wasnt turning an it was a xmas present for my son turned around sent it back in an than ordered a different one an it is still in the box i did check it an everything worked on it an was a lil cheaper
4,Comprehensive,"""The Andean Cocaine Industry"" is an expert account of drug trafficking. The authors leave no stone unturned in studying this important subject. They must be commended...this is a remarkable book."
2,Cheap (price and quality),"Great to have for your BOB or maybe on a boat or hiking. It's not very good quality, especially the compass, but hopefully it will last in storage long enough for when I have a need for it (and I hope that's a really long time)For the $5 price I would buy it again with free Amazon shipping, but I wouldn't pay more. I think I could probably find it for $2-3 in a clearance bin at some sporting goods store."
3,Disappointing. Don't use in backpacking or similar outings.,"I purchased this with the sole purpose of adding to a homemade car emergency bag and I certainly wouldn't rely on it for much else. The plastic seems cheap and brittle - I don't expect it to age well.So, what didn't work?The little mirror could maybe work but since it is small and deeply recessed in the cap, signaling would likely be a challenge. The flint didn't work on my test either. Nor was the compass at all functional.The case is water... resistant. It wouldn't do well if submerged.What did work?For me, the whistle functioned well enough. The lanyard would be as useful as the person's imagination.You still have a little container. If kept out of liquid it still holds matches and tender.Summary: This 5 in 1 tool has only 2 tools for me and so it will be fine in a car: where the compass shouldn't be an issue, nor the mirror, the whistle is fine for attracting local attention and I can still store some matches safely in the car."
4,whistle,"I got this for my son. He was not as impressed with it as I thought he might be. It is quieter than expected, but hopefully it will be useful some time."
2,Nice Whistle for Kids,"It did not keep my matches safe from getting damp over 24 hours. The compass is small, barely readable, but if it was all you had with you, better than nothing. I purchased this for my day trip backpacking kit and was slightly disappointed. I would not recommend this for anything other than a kids overnight camping adventure at a local Park. Not a serious tool.'Pro' - Inexpensive, small and lightweight, bright color, great toy.'Con' - Did not keep matches dry and usable, great toy."
3,"Nothing special, but it's better than just a match holder.","I was originally searching for a waterproof match storage container...I figured getting 4 other things in it wouldn't hurt. It's simple orange plastic, but the whistle is loud, the compass does work, and the waterproof area seals very well. The mirror is under the cap, and kind of not very shiny, and very small...but again, it was the same cost as a match container with 4 bonuses."
4,An exciting adventure.,"This is an exciting adventure for Flavia, Lupus, Jonathan, and Nubia in the Ancient Roman Empire. There are pirates taking kids all over the area around Mount Vesuvius after it erupts. Flavia and her friends face many dangers while they're trying to figure out who the kidnappers are.If you like exciting, mysterious, historical fiction you should read this book. It is best if read in order in the Roman Mysteries series. This is book III."
1,don't buy sony ever,"i just upgraded my operating system to windows xp and the printer didn't work.I need to get a new driver.I visited the web site and no driver for windows xp.I called customer service (and spent an hour and half hold ) and they said XP WASN'T IN THE MARKET WHEN THEY MADE THE PRINTER,SO THEY ONLY GUARANTEE THAT THE PRINTER WILL WORK WITH DRIVER THAT WAS ON THE MARKET THEN,THEY DONT HAVE TO MAKE NEW DRIVER FOR FUTURE OPERATING SYSTEMS. YOU MAY, HOWEVER, REPURCHASE THIS ITEM NEW SLIGHTLY MORE FEATURES AND XP COMPATABLE.so if you want to upgrade your system in next 3 to 6 months sony may not work with your upgrade and they won't do anything about it.Thats what sony's policy is."
3,Prpblems with the DPPSV55 printert,"I was hoping to find some one who knew why I could not download pictures from my computor Memory stick, to print on my new Sony printer DPPSV55 ? It works great with the memory stick. After downloading the installation CD evey thing checks out ok, right down to the final finish, except when I click on print---- nothing happens."
1,"Best interviewee, worst writer","When I heard an interview with him on the radio, I thought it was one of the best interviews I ever heard and I couldn't wait to buy the book. Now I wonder if I'll ever finish it.The people who understand the subject and find it interesting will reject his writing style in a second. It seems like he wants to emphasize his creative writing degree from California much more than he wants to emphasize his interesting experiences on these ships.His writing is overly artsy and the scenes are wildly disjointed. I wish some director would make a movie of his stuff and unwind the esoteric nonsense. It would probably be very worthwhile then..."
1,missing part,hello i just ordered the winnie the pooh and piglet paradise 4pc floor mats set plus bonus license frame but i didnt get the license plate. i need the license plate frame because that is showed in the picture when u buy it.contact me at lizi1509@hotmail.com i need an answer please
2,Disapponted,"I have a different point of view from the other reviewers I read. I found the set disappointing because I have an old yoga DVD by Rodney Yee that I love and expected this one to be calm and relaxing like that one. I hated all the chattiness and giggling that was going on in this one, it distracted me from the way I like to do yoga.If you're looking for a yoga DVD that is soothing and quiet, DON'T buy this one! If you want something more like a regular workout tape that does use yoga postures but with people talking a lot and trying to keep your attention, this might be OK for you. I just kept wanting to tell them to quiet down and stop being so silly."
3,Not everything you need to know for massage boards but a good start,"Nice start for the budding massage enthusiast or short 500 hour program text. Only covers Western Modalities aka Swedish style massage. Very brief intro to anatomy and movement. Very little about pathology. On the plus side it is a very easy read and the break down of muscle attatchement and origins is very clear and clean. You could make flash cards out of the info on them! Nice. There is far too little information on the cultural variations interpretations of touch experience. For just one text get the Mosby's. But if you add Trail Guide to the Body and one solid book on Oriental medicine that includes meridians and theory and a good color book with lots of muscles in it, take a year of Qigong and find you can listen to a quiet cd without falling asleep - you will be ready to start massage school. Trust me, staying awake while listening to relaxing music is a skill!"
5,The Cadillac of springform pans!,"La Forme pans are the best the Kaiser makes. This pan is wonderful for making my delicious New York Cheesecake. The construction quality is top-notch and very heavy-duty. The nonstick coating is durable enough that you can cut right on the tray! The springform locks securely on top of the bottom tray. Lesser springforms lock onto the edge of the tray. Kaiser's design makes for less spillage and peace of mind. The thick metal construction provides even heating for a perfectly cooked cheesecake with a golden brown top.I have both an 8"" and 9"" La Forme Springform Pan and I love them both! Check your recipe for size, but the 8"" pan is required for most recipes. Additionally, the springform is quite deep, minimizing ingredient overflow problems.With reasonable care, this springform pan should provide a lifetime of use.Highly recommended!"
3,Smaller than stated,"My major disappointment in this springform pan is that the internal diameter is more like 7"" rather than 8"" which makes a difference in the total volume and thus affects what recipes will work in it. I would have preferred knowing ahead of time that the internal diameter was smaller. The leakproof design is OK but I have only had old springform pans leak."
5,Fabulous,I absolutely loved this. I still love it. It is perfect under just about anything except for strapless shirts. I couldn't be more happy with this product and the control it gives me.
5,One of the best ...,This is one of the best books - ever - on architecture and period style/design - a must have for any restoration work. I've also used it to date period/antique pieces.
5,I like him like a metaphor!,"This CD is ridiculously dope. His lyrics are on point, and the beats are great!"
2,a Broke Mos Def Meets a Broke Common,"Lupe Fiasco has some good wordplay&vibe in his work,but he ain't there with how he is being hyped. in deed his Mix tape had more bang overall for the ear than what has been released. also what hurts him is the Production here is just kinda there in places. let me say right now he is too close in vibe&stylings to Fellow Chicago Native Kayne West. I know&Understand the Connection,but Lupe in some ways sounds like is rapping over cuts that didn't make ""College Drop out"" or something.I could see him making a Name for himself,but he needs room to grow&something to reach for before he gets mentioned with Other MC's who have been on the Grind for a good while now."
5,best CD i've heard in a while,"This is the best rap CD that I have listened to in a while. Lupe deserves 10 stars for his departure from the norm and his willingness to take on the obstacle of going against the grain. A definite must have for anyone who wants ""Real"" lyrics."
5,Beats Tsunami,Freq response is much flatter from top to bottom than than the TOL Tsunami cable. I highly recommend this cable.
3,Is not the same as OEM,I put this on my 2004 Polaris Sportsman 400 ATV. I use to hit 47 mph when the ATV was new. I smoked my belt a few times pulling logs and was going through a major fluid change so i decided to change the belt.My top speed now with this belt is 40mph. Before I changed it I could go 44mph. I don't really care about the 4 mph but some customers might.
4,The book I most recommend for beginning practice,Many people ask me after my tour what book I would recommend most. Vodou Visions is most suited to those who wish to venture into the practice the Vodou religion. It is a beginners book and there are not many rituals provided but the list of the lwa (spirits) is exhaustive. One may create their own rituals easily with Glassman's guide. If one wishes to learn more about the history of Vodou I would recommend another book.
3,Modern history .....,"Modern history ..... Amusement , but not to special . It is a ""B"" documentary ."
1,Complete Dissapointment!,"I seriously think that ""Postern of Fate"" is one of the WORST books I have ever read! The plot is so confusing and boring that you really have no idea what crime was committed in the first place! The only reason I read the whole book was to find out te ending, which was even more dull than the book itself. What was Agatha Christie thinking?"
2,Stop talking and DO something!,"When you've reached the fifth of six discs, and the detectives are still trying to figure out whether they're actually investigating the mystery and, if not, whether they should start . . . you've got a problem. Christie was usually at her best with Tommy and Tuppence, but unfortunately all her worst faults are on display here. The book is 10 percent something that resembles a storyline, and 90 percent poorly fleshed-out characters sitting around repeating themselves, vaguely wondering about things, and throwing out references to Christie's previous books until the book sounds more like an advertising flier than an novel. Bill Wallis does a good job with the reading, but he has nothing to work with.Unless you like hours and hours' worth of people talking in circles, stick with the other Tommy and Tuppence books, and leave this one alone."
1,"'Postern of Fate' was, overall, not very exciting","'Postern of Fate' was, overall, not very exciting. It was the first of Agatha Christie's books I have ever read, and it was not a good way to start out with an author. She contradicts herself in more than one place, and the plot is hard to follow. If you're a Christie addict, go ahead, but otherwise, read something else."
3,Agatha in her old age,Not one of her best. Repeats a lot. Just like us old guys. Nevertheless I finished it. I think I have read all of her books now.
2,"Pretty terrible -- and yet, distinctly Agatha Christie","The bad has been well-documented: the book moves at a snail's pace, places its intrepid protagonists at the periphery while presumably more interesting stuff is happening ""off-screen"", it's full of endless digressions, it never coalesces, and everything sputters toward a muddled and unsatisfactory conclusion. There was probably a good fifth Tommy and Tuppence story to tell, but this isn't it.That being said, while Mrs. Christie's storytelling prowess has failed her, her literary voice remains intact. The writing flows incredibly smoothly, an absolutely blessing when the pacing is so slow, and the ebb and the dialog retains her characteristic patter. If I were out of other Christies to read, it would be worth slogging through this one just to reconnect with a unique literary voice, even one far, far from the height of her powers."
2,It really works accurately ! (some times),"It is very light in weight.There is a LED light with seperate switch to point and find Key-holes which is very handy.The Digital pressure guage most of the times shows error.You have to hold this in a specific position for it to read and give results.And finding this correct angle each time is a big task.Reading on the guage is not very exact but some where nearby.Instead of 29, it shows 27 or 27.5I would suggest you go in for more quality(expensive models) so that you don't end up buying similar items over and over educating yourself which brand/model really serves the purpose and is durable.THIS IS AN AVERAGE PRODUCT !"
1,Accutire Key Chain Tire Gauge,The tire gauge that I received didn't work. It looked good but didn't work. I returned it to the company (UPS w/paid shipping to return a working gauge to me) almost 3 weeks ago but haven't heard anything from them. Not good! Certainly not happy! Amazon - do you check out your vendors?Matthew
4,Dances with wolves (original motion pcture sundrack),"Having seen and enjoyed the movie, the soundtrack brings everything back. It is most enjoyable if you have seen the movie."
5,Peaceful Perfection,"John Barry's score for Dances with Wolves is some of the best music I have ever heard. I don't know alot about John Barry, but this score is the work of a master. The music works well in the film, as well as on its own. Mr. Barry uses the whole orchestra in a very moving and powerful way. He wrote many themes that give the film more depth and feeling.For me(and I hope many others), this score is the most relaxing and peaceful I have ever heard. I have never heard the orchestra played in such a smooth and almost quiet way. Even the action and suspense themes are magnifcantly beautiful.Dances With Wolves is one of the best soundtracks ever. I recommend this album to any one who seeks peaceful music. Just listen to the sheer beauty."
5,Better than 'Best'.,I have seen this wonderful movie several times. I always have and I always will love this CD. This CD is hard to beat !!
4,Pretty Amazing Stuff,"I only listen to Elizabeth Reed and Jessica but that is 26 minutes of music, this is a great addition to any music fan's collection, they won a grammy for this I think, I don't see me ever giving this one up"
1,National Book Award? Are you kidding me?,"This was absolutely awful. None of the characters are well developed, so you really don't care about them at all. It's just a series of short little scenes about people getting killed or tortured in explicit, gory detail, alternating with people having sex or masturbating in explicit, gory detail. I only finished it because I was on a plane with nothing else to read."
1,Bad novel!. Don't buy this book!,"This woman has a poor historical background of my country and the Lopez Family.Too much sex, just like a porno novel and bad use of Spanish in many parts of the novel.Simply awful! After reading it, I threw it in the bin."
1,And it won a literary award?!,I am so embarrassed...I encouraged my book club to read this! Save your time and money - very poor.
4,Great for the price!,"For the price, this is a beautiful set. Since it was so inexpensive, I expected the material to be rough and was pleasanlty surprised to find that it was incredibly smooth and soft. Unfortunately, the comforter doesn't have much stuffing and it not very warm. However, it is very nice looking. You get what you pay for!! It is great for a guest room."
1,poorly put together,"when i recieved the set, i noticed that there were serveral loose thread all over the comforter. it looks as if it was just thrown together. they are also very uncomfortable to sleep on. the sheet is very slippery. they also do not fit well on my bed. i am very disappointed that i paid 50 bucks for such a poor quailty set."
4,Good quality for the price,I paid $60 for this set on ebay. It is a direct match with Croscill Chambord which runs about $300 for the set. I wanted a cheap alternative. My only complaint is that i constantly snag my wedding ring on top and it pulls and runs.
1,Flag Of Treason,"I was looking for a historical flag to order that represented the history , honor and courage of my fellow Americans and by accident came across this piece of trash which represents treason, slavery and shame."
3,Very nice for decorative display,"Colors not as intense as desired, especially blue on cross bars. Very good quality, but a little difficult to remove creases from nylon."
2,Didn't worked for me.,"Maybe the first love/break-up is something that you'll never get over. :( Oh well. It might work for some, but for me, I am still haunted by the past."
3,it was okey,"in this book you won't find any hard core advice on how to deal with the loss of love and it does not offer anything you haven't heard before or you haven't read on the internet or from a magazine. the advices are good, but they are very light and nothing new. it's easy to read and it's short. i finished reading the entire book in less than 3 hrs. the poems were very nice though but over all this book did not really help me."
3,I expected more from the reviews,"I guess I expected too much after reading all of the positive reviews. This book was so much smaller than I expected too. It isn't necessarily bad but not the best book for this subject. A better alternative to this book is ""Getting Past Your Breakup"" by Susan Elliott."
5,Give it as a gift,"For fourteen years I've given this book as a gift when friends lose loved ones. This is not an intense read, and very comforting. There is something for everyone."
3,More of a reference guide,"This book does not follow in any sequential pattern. Not a book I would recommend if you wanted to read for steps on how to survive the loss of a love. Hope this review helps, because this book did not help me."
5,Wonderful little book,"A good friend gave me this book four months after the loss of my mother. The book is easy to read with 92 chapters written like little notes, on the opposing page is a small poem that captures the note perfectly. Most of us don't have any idea what to expect emotionally when a loved one passes, this book is a course in dealing with yourself. The book is for anyone that has suffered a loss of a parent, spouse, pet, job or friend. I bought four additional copies and have given all four away. The only question you will ever have is deciding when the time is right to give the book to someone you care about."
1,Great book.,Got the book for a friend that just lost her husband to cancer. She loved the book. Highly recomend this book to people that have lost someone.
2,It leaks,"It is a shame! It is an exceptionally nice electric kettle, but after 6 months it has started to leak. I have a friend who claims his leaked also."
1,Leaks after few months,"I wish I had read all the one star reviews before buying this kettle. It worked fine for a few months but then it started leaking onto the heating platform, making it unusable.I do have to say that this apparently is not the only one of this kind that leaks. I have seen another brand that leaked just like it. So it may be industry wide problem. But for a big name brand like Braun to not come up with a solution for an otherwise fine product is simply stupid business practice."
5,Electric kettle,"This is a great purchase. My friends and family admire this product as it is very safe to use and very convenient as well. I bought it because I burnt three kettles in a row just forgetting to turn them off. This one doesn't require any attention, you pour water and push the button - it turns off automatically.I wish I bought a smaller one as this one is a bit heavy for me. It is very handy when you have guests though.I would recommend this product to anyone."
5,A little heavy but very convenient,"We bought this as a replacement for its white plastic equivalent, which we'd had for about 6 years or so. When shopping around for a replacement I came across this stainless steel version and, given the concern about plastics leaching into water during heating, decided to try this instead.Just like the plastic one, this kettle can be placed on its base in any orientation, so whatever angle you're standing at it's comfortable to lift and replace. This kettle is rather heavier than its plastic counterpart, and it takes a bit of time to get used to the extra weight. If you have weak wrists or arms this may be awkward to use and you may prefer the plastic one."
2,Broke after 3 years,"Worked fine for about 2 years, then totally stopped working. Must be cheap parts, flimsy manufacture - 'planned obsolescence'? I won't buy Braun again and now realize I may have to spend a bit more to get an electric kettle that lasts."
5,Love it!,"I was reluctant to purchase an electric hot water kettle having had a ""not so good"" experience with one earlier in my life. I am so glad I took the chance. I love this kettle. It heats so rapidly. Much more quickly than my stove. I don't need to turn on the burner on my stove so the house is staying cooler (good for the summer when I make ice tea the most!) The only thing that I don't like about it is that the cord is too short. All of the outlets on my counter are above the splash board -- the cord won't reach. I don't want to use an extension cord so ... I have to place the kettle on something so that it can heat -- could be dangerous if a child were to knock it off, etc."
5,Wonderful electric kettle. Wouldn't want to do without!,"I grew up in Europe and have been missing the convenience of electric kettles in the US. I finally bought this one. While it is certainly more expensive than a plastic kettle, it's worth its money. I use it every day to boil tea water. Also comes in handy when you don't want to wait forever to heat up your pasta water. Another reviewer listed that this kettle was 2200 watts. THIS IS INCORRECT. It is only 1500 watts. It does take a bit longer than the European kettles to heat up water, but it is still more convenient than heating it up in a regular pot on the stove."
3,Very fast,"It boils water conveniently fast. The thing I don't like about this product is, that has only one leyer and is being very hot."
1,Good kettle. Bad filter.,"The filter wears out quickly and is not covered by warrantly. I had to buy a new filter after six months, which is aroung $12. Customer service horrible."
3,Wonderful but short-lived,"I have had the stainless WK600 in my office for 2 1/2 years, using it 4-5 times a week. I loved it despite the freight train noise while heating, because it heated a lot of water really hot really fast, had all those safety shut-off features, and it looked pretty sitting there. Plus, the water stayed hot long enough for me and co-workers to enjoy more than one cup.But it won't heat any more. For a few days, the light flickered and I could rock the on-off switch to get it to go back on, but not now. There is no repair shop in my state, so I guess I now own a non-electric thermos kettle. I will be calling the 800 service number, but the price of shipping it for repair will probably be too high.Most appliances last a lot longer than 2 or 3 years, and this one was babied not abused. At the price, it should function longer."
3,worked one year,after one year of use we had to get replacement - push ON button and nothing happends !
1,SAME TITLE as DENIS JOHNSON,"Can someone PLEASE inform this IDIOT that Denis Johnson has a book titled Already Dead - and that it is actually a GOOD BOOK - as opposed to a Goth New Yorker's wet dream that he's a vampire and that New York is cut up into various gangs of vampires. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!! I actually bought this book thinking it was by DENIS JOHNSON - so I suppose if he was trying to sell books, that's one way to do - TRICK YOUR READERS INTO THINKING YOU'RE A DIFFERENT WRITER!"
4,"I'm not a zombie fan, but....","I really enjoyed this book. The flawed ""hero"" of the story, a vampire who is an enforcer/assassin for one of the vampire leagues, is a very interesting character. Although he is a killer, he becomes a sympathetic character in his determination to save a young girl from harm, and his attempts to keep a zombie virus in check. Quite a good read, although as has been mentioned, it is quite dark in places."
2,A disappointment,"I rushed to buy Already Dead after reading that it is being turned into a film since books are almost always so much better than their celluloid counterparts and all the reviews I read praised it highly. Unfortunately, it just never grabbed me in the way I was hoping. It was well written, was plenty dark -- just how I like my vampire stories, and the characters were well developed; but for whatever reason the story was somewhat offputting. It all seemed too contrived and convoluted. I just never felt a bond with the characters, and by the end I hardly cared what happened. I was just ready for it to be over so I could move on to the next thing."
4,Mannix Noir,"This was a nice blend of traditional ""hard boiled"" detective story-telling and the ""I vant to drink your blood"" school of vampire vs. humanity. The main character, Joe, is the stereotypical tough guy against the establishment, except ""the establishment"" is a coalition of undead that runs the vamp side of Manhattan. Joe is somewhat the reluctant blood drinker, who will drain a bad guy but fight for the innocent in the next second. A good read."
5,Awesome book,"I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long time. It's an engaging fast paced story with great dialogue. The whole story fits together neatly and everything falls into place at the end.However, I do have one complaint, and that's with the formatting. This book has no chapter breaks, and there's no quotation marks around the spoken parts. I assume that's the author's style since the printed version seems to match the Kindle version. But please, at least put in a line break between the chapters. It's very jarring to have a sudden scene/chapter shift with nothing to indicate the break. There were many times that I had to back up and reread parts to find where the break occurred."
5,already dead,"very well written, easy to get lost in. hard to put my kindle down. a very nice break from the current vampire genre. thrilling and really gets your heart racing."
2,Half-baked,This story just didn't grab me. The concept of this story was good but the delivery fell short. I only finished this book because I had nothing better to read. I can accept predictability in a story but this book seemed adolescent at times. The plot seemed empty and trivial. I didn't find the main character impressive in the least and I definitely will not be reading the rest of the series. Thank goodness I got this book from the library.
2,Not a fan - looks cheap,Not sure why I am required to write a specific number of words. I didn't like it . Period. I need two more words before I could submit my review-DUMB. I think it will be my last review
5,Perfect for a princess,"We put this TV in my daughter's room. She just loves it, and plus it looks great with all of her other Disney Princess stuff. It is not to often you can find pink appliances.It is also great that it comes with two remotes, one for her and one for me. It is perfectly paired with the DVD player, and just looks so darn cute!!!Also very clear picture and durable, better quality than what I expected from a thirteen inch TV."
2,Too Drawn Out,"Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me. When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon. The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded. Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem. The plot was good, but moved slowly. I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much. I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store. I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it."
5,Anything by this author I just love !,I love absolutely anything by this writer and this book is no exception. A page turning read that almost caused me to be late for work the next morning!
1,Why am I surprised?,"This is another author who is now ""phoning it in"" You can almost see ms. Steel with a backboard plotting the all too predictable turns this book takes. It is not even well written and has lots of redundant passages. It was so boring....Don't even wait for the paperback try and find a new author."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big Danielle Steel fan and have read all of her books, but this one was very disappointing. There was nothing happy or upbeat about it, nor was it very creative. It was somewhat depressing and boring."
4,Good ending to the series,"The Perfect Kiss was a good ending to the series about the Merridew sisters. Grace poses as a travelling companion to help a friend trying to get out of a forced betrothal. She meets Dominic Wolfe, her friend's ""intended"" and thus begins the story. I love reading books about heroines that are helpful to others, those that change the lives of those in need - Grace did this to the neighbors of Dominic Wolfe. I also enjoyed Dominic - he was trying his hardest to be cold and hard-hearted, but he found himself caring for others, usually without realizing he was doing it. The story between Grace and Dominic was very sweet and I loved that the author brought Grace's family in at the end of the book and how they looked out for her. Sigh...I've really loved spending time with the Merridew sisters!"
2,Believe the Reviewers,"Most said that the book stinks, but I ignored them because I didn't want the series to end. BIG mistake. First, it's inane. Second, no matter how you try to explain it away, the lead characters are CHEATERS-- who wants that in a romance? I should have quit w/Perfect Stranger."
4,Very Ambitious,"A bought this CD a couple of weeks ago and listened to it in its entirety today. The music itself is pretty straight forward metal, nothing overly epic. The spoken passages tie everything together nicely, however the attempts at Scottish accents (from Germans) was a bit distracting. Overall, I enjoyed this CD quite a lot. I was prepared for a Thy Majestie-type epic adventure but was pleasantly surprised by the slightly raw feel, not of the production, of the music itself. Definitely worth a listen."
2,Formulaic and uninspired,"Like many here, I have been a fan since the Bauhaus days. That is why this record is such a disappointment. Everything from the lyrics to the instrumentation to the arrangments and production seem to indicate that Murphy has given up trying to be artistic, creative and musical and has decided to just make a buck. Make no mistake, he still has the greatest voice around (which is why I give two stars instead of one), but a great voice singing factory-made pop junk is not much of a prize. If you are new to Murphy, buy the Bauhaus catalog and some of the early PM records, from back when he still gave a damn. Or buy ""Dust"", which is as creative as this record is dull. Unshattered is, I'm afraid, just more disposable pop from the hit-making machine of the commercial recording industry. Instead of two stars, I'd like to give this a rating of ""Yawn""."
4,Nice Guide to COMMON Plants for the Money,"Great unabridged reprinting of two earlier printings in the late 1960's and 1970's. Looks like it was typeset with a typewriter. Very thorough guide for the money with detailed line drawings for identification. As the title says COMMON plants, I feel that another reviewer's criticism for its lack of coverage of rare species in unwarranted."
4,My Review,"The film was good and it looks great in blu ray but there are no special features, no commentary, nothing extra. It is great if all you want is the movie but if you want extras forget it..."
3,Movies get progressively worse as the series goes on.,"First movie is pretty good but the other two movies get progressively worse as the series goes on with over-the-top action sequences, and the horrible acting of the woman in Dark Of The Moon makes Megan Fox look like Meryl Streep in comparison. But both women do look amazing in blu-ray."
4,Not so cool... it's cardboard,"The set looks goodit looks good when opened, but mostly is cardboard, it's easily ruindit's better to guy it and place it behind a galss window, and watch the movies on their normal Blu-ray's instad of using this one,it's an OK set.... I'v seen better, not very impressive"
5,Very Pleased,"It was a holiday gift, however my brother-in-law was very pleased and watched them right away. I was pleased with the speed in which they shipped and arrived!"
1,These Things Su-uhk!,"My school uses these things and we spend 10-20 minutes before and after each class trying to swap our drives out. The keys are all shot, even for brand new enclosures, after only a few days. Here is what we are forced to do -- we take the double-handful of keys that are available and try them one at a time, until our thumbs and forefingers are raw, and eventually, sometimes after the third time through the entire pile of keys, one will work. It feels so good when the pain stops, it's like winning the frigging lottery!!"
1,Conversations With The Enemy,"Before you read this 'rewrite of history', why don't you read ""Why Didn't You Get Me Out"" by Frank Anton. Frank was actually IN the camps with Garwood. You can then read about what Garwood actually did from a man who was there rather than a heavily fictionalized book by an author who was not."
2,Ethnic movie,"If you are a Latin American, you may find this film interesting; if not, you may find it boring and scattered. The movie is about a filmmaker who wants to make a documentary about crime in Mexico City and discovers that some of the crime is being done by corrupt policemen. He sets out to expose them with the help of some friends. The movie suffers from the way the story unfolds, teetering between a weak drama and a silly comedy."
2,Not gonna work,"Look wise, this looks great, but in reality, I had to send it back because the top strap is way too long to create a secure fit around the seat. It will slide all over, and not serve it's purpose very well."
2,"Smells like plastic, suboptimal pocket placement","The very first thing I noticed when I opened the package is strong intoxicating plastic smell. Even my husband, who can't smell half of the things I can, pointed it out. Hardly something I want to have around my baby. Next I noticed that a lot of space was wasted because the pockets did not cover the entire surface. The only upside of this item is the thin strap on the bottom (vs the thicker ones that other brands have) that won't get in the way of the person in the seat it is attached to."
1,wrong item sent,i was looking for a car charger for a belkin fm transmitter and was sent the wrong item which is for a cellular phone.
5,Dr Lonnie swnging his tail off......,"This album starts of with an unexpected version of the ""What now my love"" where Dr Lonnies B3 playing is the enginee and as usual his solo is kind of unorthodox but still enhances the groove..so it is easy to understand that Dr Lonnie might beLou s favourite hammond player. Pete Bernsteins guitarplaying matches Dr Lonnies hammond very nicely..the contrast between Bernsteins ""cool groove"" and the hot B3 by Dr Lonnie gives an extra edge to this recording.Lou is as good as always and it is difficult to to get in that he was around 70 years old when this was recorded in 1994.Highly recommended souljazz!!!"
2,"Original, But Not That Great","I once read a review on this book, before I had read it, that the book was original, but kind of boring. At the time, I didn't think an original book could be boring. Now I understand. I wouldn't say that it's boring, exactly, just empty. The author doesn't take you anywhere. When I finished it I thought to myself, ""That's it?"" It wasn't moving or inspiring or even the least bit entertaining, which is what books should be."
5,Awesome book,This book is great! The company I work for has better sales than our competition thanks to this book and others by Les Dane.
2,Very Dark,"This book started out very slow and was alittle too dark. Although it did pick up halfway through when Kitty got involved with the woman's right to vote movement, I can't say that I would recommend anyone to buy it. I think if the focused less on the cemetary and funeral rituals and focused more on the people in the book and the relationship between Kitty and Richard it would have been a better book. The Girl with the Pearl Earring was definately beter."
3,Falling Angels fell a bit,Good but not up to Chevalier's usual standard. Just felt a little flat in comparison to her other works ALL of which I have read and thoroughly enjoyed.
4,A Change from the Normal,"When I picked up this book, I expected it to be much like Girl with a Pearl Earring, but in fact is was quite different. Not only are there far more characters that are being trusted but also the children in this story take a much bigger role. I can't say I was disappointed but I surely was surprised. While I didn't like it nearly as much as Girl with a Pearl Earring I felt that the same things happened while reading this book.1. I was transported to this time with these people.2. I was engaged by the characters and their actions; There were things I was wishing would happen, but I was disappointed with the outcome.3. I found the style, character development, and plot easy to understand and the twists and turns not obvious.Great book, I highly recommend."
2,Not her best,"The story lags, the characters are not as interesting. If you liked The Girl with the Pearl Earring and The Virgin Blue, you will be disappointed."
3,A Good Read!,"Ms. Chevalier is another author that I will pick up simply because her name is on the cover. This was a very interesting read given the fact that I love the time period that the story was set in (end of Victoria's reign, beginning of Edward's) and the way the story was told from several characters POV. This is a story about change and how we live our life. It was truly entertaining and I look forward to more work by Ms. Chevalier."
4,"Amazing, Chevalier has done it again!","After reading Girl With A Pearl Earring, I fell instantly in love with Tracy Chevalier. Her writing has this charming simplicity to it that nobody seems to be able to duplicate. I adore her writing.Falling Angels did not disappoint. While it tends to drag about half way through, when it picks up steam (towards the end)it really picks up steam!! You find yourself lost in a world of Victorian secret and scandal, a world of grave yards and forgotten dreams. It's amazing!But the biggest reason of all that I would recommend this book is because of TWO LINES uttered by one of the characters. Those two lines have become the most, amazing, eloquent lines that I have ever read. When you read the book, I am certain that you will know which two I am talking about. They will leave you breathless.I recommend this extraordinary book to all."
2,Disappointing C# Reference,"I have found this book to be a very disappointing C# reference. The scope of the book is very large, but it doesn't seem to give adequate coverage of much of anything. Time and again I have gone to this book looking for a specific piece of information only to be disappointed. Other sections of the book are very poorly written. For example, in the section on exception handling, they state correctly that exceptions shouldn't be used to break out of for or while loops, and then proceed with an example that does just that. I think the author's could have invested a little more time and effort in coming up with a better example of using exceptions. Instead of buying this book, you're much better off saving your money and just using the MSDN documentation pages."
2,too high brow for me,I kept waiting a story to unfold or stories to unfold with some interconnecting theme. I was still waiting after half a dozen snippets out of different people's lives each unremarkable lasting 2-5 minutes each. Then I became plain irritated by two bimbos filmed through the front window of their car as they sung along to some brainless pop music because this scene went on and on. Then I cheated and read the reviews to see if it would get better because the plot bloomed. Alas the other reviews also claim this is a film dealing in abstractions. Call me too straight to get this film but there should be a way to make the free-radicals/ abstractions into mini vignettes rather than panning the camera at people engaging in busy mundane ways; it is inane.
5,Its just great,"I haven't read the entire serious, i was very concerned with my purchase as some of the reviews of this material say that the index is misaligned in the Second Edition. Fortunately, this error has since been corrected. As always - its best to learn from the source. Choose Microsoft Press."
3,Not As Bad As You Might Think,"Yes, the reviews you might have read that indicate the page numbers in the index are not on target with the pages in the 2nd edition books is accurate. This isn't the tragedy you might think. For one thing, it's not rocket science to go forward or backward a few pages, and the set comes with fully text searchable CD versions of the books. This means that if you need to look something up by keyword, the search feature of the eBooks is the fast, simple way to go. This also makes studying on the go SOOO much easier. On top of that, the information has proven accurate so far, and this is rather important for certification testing. I'm glad I purchased this set, ..., this set of 4 books with CDs is less expensive than 3 books without CDs from MS Press or any other reputable Cert Press, like New Rider, SAM, O'Reilly, etc. Good Luck Certifying!"
5,Attained MCSA !!,"Along with purchasing the 70-218 book, I used this kit, hands-on experience, and a commercial assessment tool and attained MCSA status. It's Microsoft who offers the certifications, why not use their books? Know your stuff + know what they want you to know = PASS !! For the price of the bundle and the accuracy of the information, you can't go wrong."
1,Not Impressed!!!,"I read What Great Teachers Do Differently by this same author. I loved it and felt inspired to be a better teacher. The message in this book, Teaching Matters, is ""just suck it up and do it"", regardless of how bad the administration is. Yes, as teachers we owe it to our students to be 100% every day. As administrators, we owe it to our teachers to lift them up, praise them, and inspire them. I was not not motivated by this book nor was my morale was lifted. What Great Teachers Do Differently is a much better book and I recommended it to every teacher I know."
5,"Really Good Sound, no joke","This is the 4th pair of ear buds I've tried in the past 2 weeks to go along with my mp3 player, and I've finally found what I am looking for. These earbuds have a unique ear pad that fits snug inside your ear so they won't fall out while jogging, but more importantly, the bass on these is amazing. Every other in-ear headphone I tried was tinny sounding, but these have a great range, even in the low frequencies. It must have something to do with the way they extend into your ear. Seriously, if you're going to spend ~20 bucks for some in-ear headphones, these are what you want."
2,such a let down,"I love John Sandford but this book simply missed the mark. Just to the point, there is no one in it I could care about or like(important, if one is devoting hours to a book). Please, don't waste too much time on these Kidd novels, John. I'm out of books to read. Can't wait for Heat Lightning to get here in September."
3,When smart people turn dumb,"I like John Sandford's books. In fact, I like them a lot. I guess that is why I found this one disappointing. It's not a bad book. It just isn't up to his usual level. The problem here is one of believability. The two main characters, Kidd and Luellen, are just too bright to find themselves in the mess that they end up in. They should have seen it coming. I certainly did. Then there is the ending when they kill the two ""Mob"" hitmen. Oh yeah, that was real believable. Anyway, this is better than a lot of books you can read, but it's also at the bottom of Sandford's list."
5,One of the best books I have read,"Incredible. This author can write. The characters are well developed and believable. The plot is tight, suspenseful and creative. Read this one, then read the Empress File (same main characters). Hopefully, there will be more of this series (if two can make a series)."
5,Excellent recovery,Excellent strap for recovery. I have used this to remove 25+ vehicles from the Padre Island beach sands. No problem yanking anything from a car to a full size truck/SUV.
1,Simply terrible,"Fortunately, this was the last of all the Agatha Christie novels that I read, and I did so only to know I'd read them all; otherwise I'd never have known what a great writer she was in the 1920's and 30's. While several of the books written toward the end of her life (Elephants Can Remember, Endless Night, etc.) are slow, poorly imagined and dull, this has all of those defects PLUS a preposterous plot. I have always observed that her 80-year-old mysteries have a timeless quality to them -- except for telegrams and typewriters, they could take place almost in any decade. So it is interesting to note that this awful 1970 novel is also so dated."
1,Huh?,"...Except for Stafford Nye, Great-Aunt Matilda, and Theodora/Renata/Mary Ann, who are often absent for several chapters on end, the characters are so poorly developed that when they reappear, I can't disinguish one from another and I have to go back a few chapters and try to figure out who is who. And in the end, the good guys (with all three main protagonists absent) catch a couple of the bad guys, but it's not clear how or if the global plot has been thwarted.However, the book does have one memorable scene that keeps the effort of reading it from being a total waste. That is where one of the characters (can't remember which one) recounts listening to Hitler and coming away inspired and motivated, but unable to recall anything specific that he said. Maybe that was the effect Ms. Christie was trying for."
1,A Weak Book,"This mystery is too slowly paced to be of much joy for a reader. However, it is vintage Christie so it is worth reading as a mystery if one cares to make the slog."
1,Beware of Sony's corporate policy,"I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago. I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named ""Digital Voice Editor"". Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one. Only patches of the software are available to download.The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged. Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services. Think twice before making your buying decision."
5,This is Animation!,"An unrivaled and underrated masterpiece,the six volume Japanese series Giant Robo is unlike anything you have ever seen. Featuring gripping action,unbeliable animation, one of the best soundtracks of any film, and best of all, an amazing story, Giant Robo is both a homage to classic 50's anime and a new classic in it's own right.........This is the coming-of-age tale of a boy named Daiasku, who by a cruel twist of fate must command the mightest robot on earth. The animation quality and expiremental technique is unrivaled, and the story, wich revolves around the Shizuma Drive, a seemingly clean and perfect source of energy, wich carries a terrible price,takes many twists and turns. Each charecter is dynamic and whole.....there is no good vs. evil here, more like two sides with different ideas of how things should be fighting for dominance. Thought-provoking, inspiring, tragic, and riveting, Giant Robo is a must for anyone who loves a good movie-animated or not."
5,The best children's music video I have ever seen!,"From the opening chords of Conductor McCloud to the Nighttime Prayer, this DVD evidences a great creative musical spirit filled with heart felt soul. The songs are original and contemporary and stand up to repeated listening. It's shot like a real kids rock concert and moms and dads will walk away humming the tunes after one screening. Just watch the reaction of the pre-school set in the audience. They love it. Buy it, you'll love it too."
4,Cruelty invited from foolishness,"It read now though it bought at the great antiquity. analyzed it as it being a figure in which the children after the collapse of the 'bubble' economy grew up. It is very shocking and the heart has got dry.It think, when loneliness without a hero's place-to-go-to place and the figure which still do not face loneliness but for which it depends on others were very present-day Japan. This is a shocking work."
1,Poor quality,The first binder came broken and had to be exchanged. The second fell apart after a week. Avoid this product. At least the exchage was easy
2,"Wastes Tape; you need scissors, too","As some of the other posters have said, this devices wastes a lot of (expensive) tape and is difficult to use to create file folder labels. Even after a series of steps to adjust settings, you still need a pair of scissors to cut of the excess! What a waste of time and energy!"
1,Wastes Two Inches per Label,"I kid you not: every label has an inch of air on the left and the right, for a total of two inches wasted per label.You can tweak the Margin setting to reduce one of the margins to about 1/4 inch, leaving you with 1 1/4 inches of waste.Even ignoring the waste, you still need to trim each label with a pair of scissors--not very convenient, and isn't that why you bought a labeler?I sent mine back to Amazon, even though I had to pay return shipping."
3,It is good - keep some scissors handy,"The product serves its purpose and does so competently. However, I discount two stars for the following reasons:1) It is wasteful of label tape. Even when reducing margins to the narrowest setting, the product still leaves a chunk of needless white space that you need to cut off on the front of each label.2) The product can use an AC adapter but does not ship with one. Of course, this addition would probably increase the low price.3) It has a pesky way of clearing both text and settings when the ""clear"" function is used. It would be nice if it only cleared the text. The workaround is manual backspacing of each character, which is not as convenient.All in all, these are small inconveniences given the low price for an otherwise high-quality product. It is probably one of the best labelers available in its price range."
1,Beware tape costs!!,"I've had an ""M"" series labeller for years and loved it, but it wasn't available at the store when I moved to a new office, so I got the 1280. The functionality is worse, it's difficult to navigate, and worst of all, it is apparently DESIGNED to waste tape--and when the tape cartridges cost almost as much as the labeller, that's important! By default it leaves 1"" of blank tape on each end of the label, meaning for most applications you have to hand trim it with scissors. I finally found a ""margins"" option and set it to a half inch, only to find that it puts the default 1"" margin, then ADDS the half inch with a little mark to show you how much extra tape it wasted. I'll be looking back to the M series, or other brands, for my next buy."
2,"for the love of all that is holy, please let me NOT WASTE TAPE","I like brother. I really do. I think of them as my, well, little brother. But I love the earth more. And with that global warming thing, I love her all the more. She is so Hot, you know? Any hotter, tho, and we'll be swimmin' in our own waste. So, it would be nice if I could make a label that DIDN'T require a half inch of profit to go to brother. Seriously guys, greed is good, but greed means that I'm going to go buy a new label maker."
1,Too bad,"This products is trash in comparison with the PT-80 (the model we always trusted) in regards to the amount of tape waste.This product was released in 2005, now we are in 2008 and the manufacture (Brother) didn't even bother to correct the problem of the amount of wasted tape, despite the endless complains from all reviewers. 3 years and this product is still as is.. In fact I don't think its a problem on their end, this product had been designed this way, to waste more tape, thus forcing us consumers to buy more and use more.This unit is going back to Amazon and I'll get a Dymo instead. Too sad I got deceived by the brand that I always trusted."
1,Horrible!,"I thought I found a great deal on this label maker. Unfortunately, the thing is a piece of junk! The settings are difficult to adjust, unintuitive, and not well defined. The result is the waste of a lot of label tape (which is more expensive than what I actually paid for the thing) trying to get the label you want. Even when the text is set to large, and the margin is set to narrow, the text comes out tiny, then when you want a label to fit a tab or book or something, it comes out too long - it's really just a crap shoot!"
1,Bad Movie,"Very disappointed with this movie. The color was too dark, sound not good. I have a 52"" screen and still had trouble trying to see anything. One of Clint Eastwoods poorer movies. I file 13ed it!"
4,Added New Orleans Links,"After attending New Orleans' Jazz and Heritage Festival 2003, I had to watch this movie, and watch for some features not mentioned in the other excellent reviews already given this film.First of all, there is the title song played by great New Orleans' jazz saxophonist James Rivers, whom Eastwood also chose to play on ""Bridges of Madison County"" (the secret roadside club scene) and on ""Bird"". Rivers is an accomplished musician on sax, flute, harmonica, and bagpipes (yes!) - check him out!Then, there is the cemetery chase scene. This is the cemetery in which author Anne Rice played as a child, and features graves that feature in her books. A fake mausoleum was built to hide Eastwood in the chase scene.I am putting in my order for the DVD!"
1,Couldn't be worse,"We bought this Hoover Junkios a few years back to replace my 25-year-old Hoover Spirit. What a disappointment. The Telios has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It mars floors (tile and vinyl); the floor attachment connector cracked causing a loose fit to the wand; when the hose isn't kinking, it's breaking; forget using it on stairs; the suction has been engineered right out of the thing (one of the suction-reducer controls is located in the handle where it constantly gets bumped into a position further reducing it's poor suction); vacuum bags are expensive and not easily obtainable.I grew up with a Hoover in the house. When I moved out on my own, I bought a Hoover - it lasted me 25 years! But, I'll never, ever buy another Hoover after buying this Junkios."
1,Not Worth the Bother,"I agree with the other reviewers. The wand constantly separates from the hose while vacuuming. Short of glueing it on I see no other way to keep it in place. Very annoying! Plus, glueing,as other reviewers state defeats the whole purpose of having a canister vacuum. Don't waste your money. It's true that you get what you pay for but if what you have to pay with is all you have you've lost all the way around. I've had two fantastic canister vacuums in my lifetime one was the Electrolux (the old steel model) and a Singer (no longer manufactured) they were great."
5,My life seems so boring in comparison...,I only wish I could something so cool at least once in my entire life. Some people are just more blessed than others I guess. I think his most boring day is still more interesting than my most interesting one.
5,"energizing, inspiring reading","I am the director of the blind program Erik attended at age 16(chapter three). I was impressed with the quality of the writing but even more so with the maturity of the man that shines through -- the touching passages about his mother and the relationships drawn so vividly between himself and the other climbers, his thoughtful reflections on life, his feelings for his grandparents, for his wife Ellie - his joy at Emma's birth. It is much more a coming of age book than a climbing book and as such will appeal to a much wider audience. Congratultions to Erik for taking the risks and showing us the possibilities."
3,Wishful thinking,"A well written book - her descriptions of her mother are just lovely. I would like to have known her! Also Ms. Greer. However, as far as the content, well I just can't believe that one can answer the phone and speak with a deceased loved one. How I wish it were so! But, I wish the author well and hope that she is comforted by her thoughts."
5,"works well, simple and affordable",this is a good affordable buy for anybody. It works well and does what it's supposed. easy to handle yup
5,The Finishing Touches to Complete My Princess' Room,"I love the Princess DVD Player! The cute little pink dvd player fits right up under the pink Princess TV and save a lot of space in my two-year-old's room. Not only does the dvd player match my princess' room, but it is also very easy for a two-year-old to use. She picks out her own movies and puts them into her dvd player all by herself. I think that everyone that has the Princess TV should also add the Princess DVD Player to their collection!"
1,Simply awful...does not last at all!!,"Okay...this is a cute girlie DVD which would look darling in any little girls room - the fact that it might add to the decor would be the only reason to purchase this. This means if you want something that lasts - please do not bother!It does not feel good quality...very plastic and not too strong, but the biggest issue is the fact that it seems - as in the cases with other buyers - that this lasts for about 6 months, and even then problems begin to arise quickly!For us it failed to recognise discs leaving us with an error message. Add to this the DVD played would not stay open long enough to actually remove or add a DVD - you would literally have to hold on to it to stop the door shutting! It a nutshell, it began to take multiple tries to get this to work and this got progressivly worse so thankful that we had bought a protection plan, we took it back and switched it out for a regular DVD player that may lack the cuteness...but hey, it works!!"
2,Stopped working after about 1 year,"Much like the other reviews I have seen on this page, this product stopped working after only a year or so. When we first set this up with the TV I thought they were great, then slowly it would have difficulty reading DVD's and you would have to take them out and put them in a few times. Now it just doesn't read them any more at all. What a disapointment, and not worth the money you pay for them. TV that comes with this set still works well though."
1,Don't Waiste your Money!,"I bought this DVD player with the Princess TV and the little Tyke's TV with that DVD player for my Daughter and my son. And I am so very dissapointed. Both DVD players are pretty crappy. We only had them about 3 months before we stared to have problems. They aren't even working well enough now to say they work. The TV's aren't to bad but I wish I had know, I feel like this was a lot of money for about 7 month of use!! They are very pretty to look at but other than that I would have to say ""Just say NO""!!!"
1,Disney is a rip off!,"My daughter had the tv/dvd matching set. 2yr down the rd. Dvd player won't even turn on and then I find out there is no service number to call. This after having probelems w/ it every now and then. We got the Disney camera last yr and that was extremely poor quality, took it back immediately. Got the MP3 players... That has broke down as well. The Disney Electronics name has a very very bad taste in my mouth and they are doing nothing to improve it! They should really be ashamed of screwing so many people over."
5,The Classic!,This is the best classic RPG game written. Hours and hours of entertainment. You'll have to fight the kids to play this one.
5,About Monsters,"Dragon Warrior Monsters is a very good game. Although it may be costly, I still think it is worth it . I myself don't have it but I do know a little about it . My friend Scott, from America have it . He lend it to me. I also like it and is very, very sure you will like it too. Now Ialso have its Guide book and has some tips like the Grizzly, has the higest attacks . Although I wrote this review, I still wish that I could down load it on PC........."
3,Not as good as the original...,"Although the games themselves are very good, and should be played by anyone who likes RPGs, there is one major difference that casts a dimlight on these games: the originals used a more archaic language. They used ""Thee"" and ""Thy"".. it's just not the same..."
5,You'll never miss a cleaning again!,"What can I say? I work at a bookstore and my boss handed me the review copy of Teeth as I was walking out the door to go get my wisdom teeth pulled. I was happily stunned by the wit and insight of this book. I read constantly, but this is the first book by someone in my peer group that speaks my language without assuming I'm a slacker-loser. I had the great privilege of meeting Hugh Gallagher last week and am no less impressed by the author than by his work. Thanks Hugh! Can't wait for the next one."
3,BORING,This game is soooooooo boring. It's basicly you the smart chicken leading around a bunch of stupid ones. I think that you can defintly find a better game then this one. But I will admit that I haven't gotten far in it so it might get better!!
2,"Great show, Poor dvd set","I was happy to finally purchase the first volume of Darkwing Duck. That happiness was short lived when I got it unpacked and loaded into a player. The video and sound quality is very poor and varies from episode to episode. I have some old VHS copies of episodes from this volume that have better sound and picture quality to them. Another thing is that there are absolutely no chapters. Each episode is one large segment, hitting the chapter skip button merely ends the episode and brings you back to the episode selection menu. It resembles a home dvd burning software where you can load home movies into a pre-made menu and ""click"" on them when loaded into a dvd player. This product was viewed on a 720p LCD flatscreen, HDMI cable, and blue ray player. The show is not that old, why was it not remastered first before being put out as a set? Aside from the disappointing quality, it is still nice to have a copy of the episodes."
4,pet raincoat,The product was fine but too big. I requested a smaller size to be sent. I was given credit instead. I would have liked the exchange rather then going to reorder again.
5,Perfect !!!,"This is the cutest little rain coat ever. It is very well made and the lining makes it comfortable for my little one. The middle belt that is supposed to hold it on is way too long but I can loop it inside itself and it works fine. I will be adding a small piece of velcro higher up on the coat and that will easily take care of that. My Lacey weighs 20 pounds and I bought the medium. After seeing the way the medium fits a small would not have worked at all. But it is easy to get on and off and keeps her dry in the hardest rains. All in all, if you want to keep your little friend dry THIS IS IT !!!!"
2,YIKES..,This book is full of typos and errors. Where was the editor? The only reason I give it two stars is because of the narrative commentary for each year. That part is interesting. Andthe list in the back of which artists have never won a Grammy.
1,Can't wait to replace this kettle,"I regularly burn my hand when I use this kettle!The loop to lift the lid is hard to reach (especially for small hands) and it is located on the underside of the handle, close to where steam escapes from the lid. A handsome-looking kettle, but a poor design from a functional standpoint. Copco makes so many kettles, and most aree very reasonable in price. Don't choose this one. I wish I hadn't, and I can't wait to replace it!"
2,Rather use a pyrex and microwave...,"I agree with the other reviews. It is very loud- sometimes I think it may wake my kids! While my handle has not broken off (and it does not get hot), it is the complete opposite of anything ergonomic. In order to lift it while using your finger to trigger the opening mechanism, it is VERY hard to tilt far enough to get all the water out. Forget using one hand to pour it. Because of it's shape you cannot get this under the fridge tap to use the filtered water (we have very hard water here in south TX!) I have the red one so I can not speak for the stainless getting discolored, but my red one isn't. That is probably because most of the time I'd rather use my Pyrex in the micro to boil water! It does boil water, so I guess it works which is why I gave it the extra star. Don't waste your money."
2,"Thin loud metal, and the handle gets hot.","I bought this tea kettle to replace my old avocado green one when we redid the kitchen. It looked stylish, and I liked the fact that the whistle couldn't be removed. In these two respects, it it good.Here are the problems.The metal on this kettle is thin, which makes it very loud while heating up. The kettle rumbles loudly and sounds like the water is at an angry, roaring boil when it isn't even lukewarm yet, and the noise persists and just gets louder. It can be heard in the living room, even after just a few seconds on the stove.The handle on this tea kettle gets very, very hot and can't be picked up without a pot holder unless you wait for it to cool down, which isn't ideal."
5,A Gift of Self-Esteem,"This is a lovely gift book to celebrate a friend or relative.While it is wonderful for children, it will also be meaningfulto an adult. The book title says it all; it is a fast readfull of joyful sentiments about how terrific ""you"" are."
1,Disappointed,"Should have known better because of the cost! Must have missed the part where it said this is an imitation product, I'll know better next time.Thanks Anyway."
5,works fine,"It's a transmission filter, it either fits and works or it doesn't. It fit fine and it works fine."
4,Up And Coming,"This Euro-Hard Rock band hass a style and sound all to themselves. With wonderful choruses, and tight guitars, keys and rythms, Royal Hunt is like a modern day Rock Opera. Lead by Keyboardist Andre Andersen, RH has packed clubs around the world, and hopefully will be coming back to the USA. This album is a journey through the eyes of someone questioning his meaning in life, and rocks you through the final lulliby. Great for any hard rock headbanger, or anyone who likes Dream Theater. It wont let you down."
4,WAS A SPLENDID WAY TO END THE WWF GAMES ON N64!,"..Don`t you agree?Anyways why is it underated on GameSpot but PS1`s WWF SmackDown! 2:Know Your Role got 10% more?!-Well old news anyway.So anyways i think this game is MUCH better than the first 3 WWF SmackDown! games(WWF SmackDown!,WWF SmackDown! 2:KYR and WWF SmackDown! 3:JBI!) it has better graphics and is more authentic than the first 2 SmackDown! games(not JBI)uhh i dunno what else to say BYE!"
1,"PRETTY GOOD, BUT",This game was the best thing for n64 but the graphics were not as good as the game itself was. lots of fun. unfortunatly does not have a table match has more superstars than i ever known. In the tag team ledder match has only one ledder. thousands of moves. You may create a new superstar or use the dosens of superstars made for u....
1,Stay Away,"This is the worst wrestling game I have ever played. The graphics are awful, and so is the gameplay. It seems cool at first having so many wrestlers, but they all have nearly the exact same moves, which destroys the point of multiple characters. My best advice is to stay away from this game."
3,best wrestling game for the 64,"I like this game very much and I strongly recumend it.Its great when playing with friends and family.The reason i gave this game 3 stars.The game dosnt have that many game modes comparing to smackdown!2 know your role for the playstation console.smack down2 has a wide veriety of game modes such as hell in the cell,casket match,and TLC.but comparing the create a wrestler from no mercy to smackdown2,i have to admitt,no mercy is much better.I also compared this game to wwf attitude.Two things that attitude has that no mercy dosent.1st of all attitude has anouncers presenting the match and 2nd of all attitude has full ring enterances including the ring.another reason i gave this game 3 stars is because of championship mode.it feels its almost impossible to get another story line without having to read the sme one youv done all ready.other then that the game is great and its a must own."
3,The slowdown is NO FUN,"I've looked at the reviews for this game a few times and I finaly decided that I need to review it. I can't believe this game averages 4.5 stars. I've had this game since the day it was released. I also have WM2000 and WCW/NWO Revenge. Heres the thing: The game is great except for one thing. When you get more than two characters in the action at a time the game slows down to unbearable speeds. The only way to enjoy this game is with 2 wrestlers only. Don't play tag-team, and dont even think about a Royal Rumble. Due to this slowdown we essentially loose half the game. To sum up.... If you played only with two wrestlers all the time the game earnes a 5, but if you like Royal Rumbles or Tag Team its a 1 star. The only reason to buy this game is if you REALLY want to play the new wrestlers that are on this one and not on WM2000. Of course, you do get to play as our olympic hero if you buy No Mercy, and that's reason enough for me :-)"
4,Well....I got this game X-Mas 00 and....,"It is hard to beleive that after over a year I am still playing this great game. If you own an N64 and you are a wrestling fan and you dont have this game...you are missing out on something. Smackdown 3 doesnt compare...sure it has alot more matches, but the # of wrestlers and CAW spaces is extremely poor. This is a great game!"
2,Bad Bad Bad Game dont buy this game its not a good game.,This game is a very good game.But everything i do in the championship mode get's deleted.The game saves but everytime i get a belt like after a week it gets deleted.Plus in this game there is no TLC.There is no HELL IN A CELL.Hay the undertaker in this game does not even come out on his motorcycle.This game is not good.I wish i never got this game.But This fall SMACKDOWN3 is coming out.You talk about game smackdown3 its the best.Everthing you can think of is in the game.Everything that has been done in real life on raw is war.Or smackdon the TV shows.Even the last man standing match n in smackdown3 Just Bring it.I just say this you wwf no mercy fans watch out cause smackdown3 is coming.And smackdown3 will be out of this world.
1,BEWARE!,"Yes this soap smells great. BUT - the ""bar"" of soap is 1"" x 1 1/4"" x 3"", or about the size of the free stuff you get at most hotels! $6 for a bar of soap that will probably only last two showers is absurd."
5,Wow! GREAT show!,"Incredible show! Great story line and writing, incredible acting and beautiful scenery and costumes. I was hooked on this series after the 1st episode. Such a welcomed change from reality tv. OUTSTANDING in all ways!"
1,A really poor second,"This has all the pomp and flash of modern shows but none of the substance of the classics. Shallow, silly, tacky and unrealistic, it's now just one more trite, predictable ""bad nazi"" themed dramas."
4,Good show,Love downtown abbey and was caught up to current episode. Someone told me to check this out and I'm glad they did. The characters are well developed and storyline is very compelling. Definitely a good way to spend an hour!
1,No Option for LESS than one star,"Poorly written, bad puns, irritating beyond belief. I am from St Louis and adored Elaine Viets columns in the St Louis Post Dispatch. She should stick to short columns because she most surely cannot write mystery novels."
1,Depressing and not funny.,"Page 10: ""Helen had picked up a handy crowbar and ended her marriage with a coule of swift swings. She still remembered the satisfying crunching sound."" That's the reason the heroine is on the run. This is sick stuff. How can I cheer on someone like that? With pages 16-19 we get a disgusting invasion of bugs. This is when I quit reading. I don't like the dark humor (?) and the anti-male attitude."
5,"""Elvis has left the building!""","This movie really creeped me out the first time I watched it, which was when i was about ten years old. now that i am thirteen, it doesn't seem that bad, but it still gives you a case of the creeps. One of the scariest, worst situations you could possibly be in is being framed for murder. you can't go to the police because there's no evidence that points to someone else and the person would probably kill you and your family/friends.as for this movie, the actors were womderful! Rob Lowe was creepy, and James Spader was very convincing as a boring geek. I would easily reccommend this movie to anyone who loves a good thrill!!! ; )"
2,Not our favorite Baby Songs!,"We have several Baby Songs tapes which my girls love and they get ready to nap and go to bed with Baby Songs Animals. When I found out there was one about sleeping I was very excited. But, this video does not promote sleep in my kids. The first part of the tape is very good and soothing. Around the middle and especially at the end it is not. The segment in between songs is very loud in a couple of places so a relaxed sleepy kid is startled. Then the last two songs (I think they are the last two) have terrible visuals. One has a puppet flying around and it is the ugliest thing. Another has a little men on the crib. One song is about a kid who keeps waking up in the night and going in to his parents bed - he ends up getting to stay and the mom sleeps in his bed. Not an idea I want to promote. I wish they would redo this video and make it more for sleeping. Some of the songs are good.Jennifer"
2,Sort of scary...,"My 8 year old daughter and I found parts of this movie somewhat freaky (although the two year old did fine). The song called ""Lovey"" depicts stuffed animals suddenly becoming life-sized during the day. The final vignette made my 8 year old cover her eyes - it depicts a scary looking puppet/dummy (as if in an old horror show or twilight zone, like a ventriloquist would use) that suddenly opens it HUGE eyes, flies around the room (bed and all), and opens up the window. We did NOT find this movie restful, although we like the other BabySongs videos..."
2,disappointed,"Like the other two reviews, I am very disappointed in this tool.I own many Bosch tools and have never been disappointed in any of them, but this saw is poorly engineered, there is way too much flex between the saw and the base, making square cuts impossible.Bosch blew it on this one."
4,Trust and honor,"The Romulan Commander Ael t' Rlailiiu must choose between her oaths and her honor - and Kirk must decide if he is willing to trust an old enemy.Another excellent novel from Duane. The Romulans in this book are some of the most interesting characters I've read recently, with different values and morals than the human characters but throughout the story it is clear that that makes them alien, but not necessarily evil. There is also a wide variety of non-humanoid aliens, such as the rock-eating Ensign Naraht, who is analytical enough to please Spock and friendly enough to please everyone else, for all he apparently looks like a pizza moving along the floor."
5,Great taste!,The only thing better than the taste is the aroma! The house smells awesome after cooking this! Gluten free too!
3,Pretty good,"This flavor is good. We like the creamy parm one better, but its good for a change. A little too soft, would like more firm, but its still a good choice for a side dish. A friend of mine adds chicken to it to make a meal"
3,good brackets,Brackets are good but the screws that attach the bracket to the speaker was not the right size. They were to fat and would not thread in. I had screws so i used mine. Other then that they work well.
4,Great mount; verify the screw size,"I took a chance with these as my speakers are not Bose. The mount is great (with a neat pivot mechanism), but I had to get some additional hardware to rig my speakers up to them. The machine screw in the bracket is 10-32, but my speaker needed a 1/4-20 machine screw. Too bad the screw size wasn't in the specs, but I doubt Bose owners need to worry about it. The mounts look good now, but I would suggest caution if your speakers don't take the same size screw."
3,They Work,Because they are Bose wall mounts they do work. Getting the wires thr the walls is a pain. Also think they are way too expensive for what they are.
5,AS GOOD AS IT GETS,"As good as contemporary rock music gets. JTB takes disparate elements of post-punk, emo, classic rock, and even New Wave to create a modern masterpiece. ""Sea Anemone"" is without a doubt my favorite track, but with the exception of the weak ""Lemon Yellow Black"", every song on Orange Rhyming Dictionary stands alone as a great piece of work. Strongly, strongly recommended to anyone who considers themselves a fan of ""rock"" in any sense of the word."
5,"Edgy, ultra tight playing, obscure lyrics, almost perfection","I've listened to this CD more in two days than any other in a long, long time. I love it more with each listen. Intense and sublime at the same time, with dirty, buzzed, edgy guitar. I can feel what they are trying to say even if I don't really understand the words meaning. These guys were in Atlanta and I'm pissed I missed them. The last 40 seconds of ""King Medicine"" is awesome."
4,Book Review: The Clue in the Jewel book,"The Clue in the Jewel Box by Carolyn Keene was an exciting novel. It is part of the Nancy Drew series. It was a little slow getting into the mystery, but after the mystery part of the book got started, it got really good. It was definitely a cliffhanger. Nancy helps a former queen from Europe find her long lost grandson. Before long, Nancy finds the prince, or so she thinks. Nancy catches the prince taking small amounts of money from the queen, Mrs. Alexandria. Her grandson is also has very bad manners for a prince. What's going on with the prince? Read the book to find out! If you enjoy this suspenseful book, be sure to read the rest of the series!"
5,Very Pleased,"I have owned this phone for over two years and I have been very pleased. Voice quality is excellent; it is light and can be used either on desktop or mounted on the wall. The ringer switch allows the user to set the ringer to off, low or high. Another switch allows easy changes between touch tone and rotary dialing. Other features include last number redial button as well the ability to program 10 speed dial numbers. The price is also very reasonable. I would not hesitate to purchase this item again."
1,"Sad Sorry, Tunes",This has got to be the worst live CD I Have ever Heard. These brothers could'nt carry a tune in a bucket.If they were retired they should have stayed retired. This is the worst sounding live CD from the 70's groups I've heard. Unlike the Whispers they have gotten better with time. This SUCKS! SUCKS! they are playing off key and singing off key. They should have not made a CD. This spoiled the memory of brick for me.
1,No long version of Dazz here,"Have you ever heard a song that finds its way into your head, going round and round and round - but you can't place the title of it, or the group ? So it was with me, and ""Dazz"", put out by a group called ""Brick"" in the 70s. Imagine my delight when I heard a similar track on my XM car radio, which displays the title and group of every song played. A little research, and, voila, I had found the origin of that song which was playing in my memory.....but, alas, the song in my memory was approximately 15 minutes long, with absolutely tremendous flute and bass solo's. I ordered the ""Best of Brick"".....imagine my disappointment when it turned out to be the 3-minute version of the song. Subsequent research on the web, and Amazon, indicates that there is currently NO cd with the long track of Dazz. A real shame. If you're looking for the long version of Dazz, don't waste your money on this CD."
3,So Bad It's Good!,"This film is just plain bad, but then it's fun, if you have a slow Saturday afternoon. This DVD is made from a very poor print and looks soft to me. You'll see some actors that you've seen in other films from this era, but all-in-all just watch it for fun."
3,Classic 'B' move!,"Not much to say about the movie, it's a Saturday afternoon 'B' movie, with Ken Clark looking very hunky and a bit wooden!"
1,Having trouble viewing this dvd?,"Is anyone else having trouble viewing this on portable tv/dvd combo sets? Mine won't play! Just getting an error message that reads ""unknown disc"" :("
2,Lynch spends a weekend with a Line 6 POD,"This is more Lynch noodling around than anything... production isn't up to snuff. If you're a Lynch freak, you must have it, but if you aren't pass it by: it simply isn't worth it. The guitar, most of which is LITERALLY recorded through a simple Line 6 POD, sounds like garbage... everybody knows Lynch is a gear junky, and take that gear away: he sounds like a really talented guy playing through a POD. Sorry: not good enough."
4,very interesting!,"If you want to know a little bit about the 4 darks day, buy it. It's quite complete. There are a few photos. If you want to know more about it buy JFK by Jim Garrison ."
4,Pioneer DVR-640h-S,"Very pleased with the Recorder. Easy to set up and use, really convenient recording to hard drive rather than tapes. Only negatives are (a) menus are hard to read because they're in grey font, and (b) the instruction book isn't easy to follow. Still, after a little effort, the menus are intuitive."
4,Easy to Use,"The DVR portion is very good and easy to use. It will record and play back the ""hearing impaired"" subtitles which I use a lot to learn Spanish. At time the words are garbled by jumping back 15 seconds the words are fixed.DVD player is OK, but the images appear a little soft.I have not burned a DVD with this machine. That is the reason I have rated it only four star."
2,Doesn't Deliver,"This book sounds great, but sadly doesn't come close to what it could be. The author repeatedly leads the reader and then does not follow through. It almost seems that the author is too concerned about offending people and is afraid to go to the place he wants to go with the plot. He skirts around things and does not provide enough hard fact and detail to support his story. Either you ""go there"" or you don't, but make it clear. Disappointing read."
2,My thought' s on a new author,The book is not quite what I expected. Though after I got into it I found the storyline interesting to say the least. Usually I read things that are not so religious but all and all I would recommend this book to anyone who wants something different.
4,The red church,"At first, I thought this book was boring, because I wasn't use to this type of fiction reading. But, this book turned out to a pretty decent one. It wasn't as scary as the other readers portrayed it to be, but the twist in the end was a good one. I wasn't expect that to happen in the end. I recommend this book to others readers who are seeking a good mystery and thriller book."
1,"really, really bad...","I bought this book because of the good reviews, but I couldn't finish it because it was so bad! A haunted church? a ghost hanging in the tree? a preacher who turns into a mountain lion? Jesus told nothing but lies? Ugh!"
1,Red Church,One of the worst books I have ever read. I kept waiting for some redeeming virtue -- none! Wonder why I finished it?!
3,too much superstition,I wanted a mystery and ended up with superstitions and fears. I only made it through 3 chapters before giving up.
5,The Most Definitive Book on The 50's Music,"I bought this book way back when it first came out and also have the 2nd edition (encompasses the 60's).I read that the price for a used copy is $30.00....WELL, I wouldn't sell mine for $300.Over the years, it has been my most used book in my possession.I wish I had a copy on CD....I rate this volume and the 2nd edition 5 Stars ONLY because there is nothing higher...."
3,"Great story, but lasking elegance","I enjoyed the plot of Hell's Kitchen and found the structure fresh and fast-paced (I finished the book in one very busy week). I was, however, a little bit disappointed with the bland and sometimes clunky use of language. All-in-all, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it, but it isn't a book that I'm likely to re-read."
3,Packing!,Pipe was solid and as expected.Careful opening the box! Somebody thought it was appropriate to use packing peanuts. Including INSIDE THE PIPE! I filled a 35gal. garbage can with the packaging! Some things are just better off being bought at the local store.
5,Awesome book!,"I teach grades 3-5, and have children of my own who like to read. This book is fascinating for kids--it's full of adventure, realistic interaction between siblings, and a great source of information on life in Holland near the dikes. The vocabulary is not difficult. I use it as a read-aloud, and have yet to hear any complaints!"
4,IT HURTS SO GOOD!,"I just did the Abs and Arms section of this DVD and I was worried it wouldn't be intense enough but GOOD GOD it burns so good. <3 this dvd and, after a break, I'll be doing the Buns and Thighs section. Thank you, creepily named twins Neena and Veena, for this wonderful burn!"
5,Great workout - Except for the Abs Segment,"I have done many workouts in my short life and found that learning bellydance has helped attain my attention and body tone. The two instructors on this video are pleasant to look at and do not have the annoying mannerisms of most bellydancing instructors (whose appearance, by the way, frequently borders creepiness).My only aversion to this instruction was the abdominal section. It was extremely hard and lengthy. It was more more like a pilates abdominal workout set to bellydance music and rhythm."
1,Better Coaster!,"Bought it used it once, got bored with it, have not touched it since. Not much else you can say."
3,the good and the bad,"the arms and abs portion of the dvd is pretty good. though most of the arm work tends to be in the shoulder area, and most of the ab work is upper abs and obliques. personally i would like more bi/tricept work. still it is a fun, short (20mins) work out.the hips, buns and thighs portion of the dvd is not so challenging. i know the title says beginner, but that is misleading. it is a good work out for someone who does little to no physical activity on a daily basis.the instruction is clear, and vaguely annoying. the interface sucks, and there are dance clips as a ""bonus"". i wouldn't recommend this if you are fairly active. get the basic moves and cardio instead."
5,OBRA CLASICA EN LA PSICOLOGIA DEL SELF,"EL MATERIAL QUE EXPONE LA AUTORA CONSTITUYE UN CLASICO DE LA PSICOLOGIA DEL SELF Y LAS RELACIONES OBJETALES DENTRO DE LA TEORIA PSICOANALITICA. ESTE LIBRO ES UNA LECTURA OBLIGATORIA PARA ENTENDER LOS PADECIMIENTOS NARCISISTAS Y LAS ALTERACIONES PROFUNDAS EN EL DESARROLLO. JACOBSON ABRE CAMINO A LOS TEORICOS CONTEMPORANEOS COMO KENBERG, KOHUT, STOLOROW,ETC; QUIENES DESARROLLAN Y CONFIRMAN SUS APRECIACIONES TEORICAS."
2,"Beautiful, but not for us!!!","Okay - it's still hanging, but the color is not quite as it looks online. Has a bit of pink in it. The hanging loop rings are quite heavy with yellow glass in them - very 70's.The lamp is beautiful, but be aware of these things. Had I seen it in person, I wouldn't have purchased it. However, after hubby-dearest spent all day putting it up, it remains!"
5,A Much Needed Contribution to Rock Aesthetics,"This is an excellent book and an entertaining read. It appropriately approaches a philosophical treatment of rock music in an 'analytic' prose style. It is clear, direct, and it makes subtle category distinctions. For example, it clarifies the distinctions between 'Rock and Roll,' 'Rock 'n Roll,' and 'Rock.' It also clarifies the interpretative 'primary text' and ontological categories of rock music as the recording and recording process, as opposed to the song lyric, performance event, etc. This book clarifies the distinctive aesthetic appeal of rock music as a cultural product without the high art/low art condescension. I highly recommend it, especially to readers who are familiar with analytic philosophical aesthetics, writers such as: Cavell, Carroll, Kivy, Levinson, Walton, Scruton, Eaton, Hagberg, Danto, Wollheim, Higgins, Goodman, et. al."
2,Labyrinth of Bordem (Continued),"I agree.. I thought this book was super boring. I just started to read as a hobby in this past summer.. I am only reading Star Wars books and to me, personally, thought this was crap. I think it just was Luceno. The way he tries to describe everything just seemed to make my mind drift into other places and not on what he was trying to say.The story was okay, different from the Clone Wars animated series which I enjoy. He did through in a few new things to the Star Wars universe.Overall, I did not care for this book. It took me a long time to finish it because I had to keep going back and rereading what I missed (because my mind would drift). I might pick up another book of Luceno to just see if he is the same for those, or was it just this.Hope this helps..."
3,More in-depth,"I'm only about halfway through the book but it's good and reveals quite a bit leading up to Episode III. I'm a big SW fan but that primarly lies in the movies, old-school toys, and currently the Clone Wars cartoon, which is actually pretty good. If you're into the books and haven't picked this one up yet I'd say do it, the story flows well and answers many questions."
2,Not pleased with this book,I just got done reading Labyrinth of evil a few days ago. I thought it was empty of substance. No real questions were answered about the forth coming movie. I also found typos all over. If James Luceno is that much of an accomplished writer I shouldn't have found that many mistakes. It is also suppossed to be the book before Star Wars III well at the end of the book we are left hanging in the air. By the time he comes out with a book to end this one the movie will be on DVD. I do not reccomend it.
5,"Colorful, Interesting, Interactive","So many toys for babies are overstimulating - lights, loud noises, battery draining monstrosities. This ball is excellent. It has enough going on to keep our 11 month olds interest - moving parts, clacking of pieces, rattling, smiley faces, relections.. but no loud blaring noise, no seizure inducing lights.. nothing to drive Mom and Dad batty. I'm actually ordering a second one for my Brothers 3 month old. Definitely a great toy. It's about the size of a softball, big enough not to loose it, but small enough to be a toy you could throw in your diaper bag. Defintely would reccommend this as a simple, low maintence toy for a baby that's just exploring the world around them."
3,Not what Id hoped for.....,"""The Wildest Shore"" was an entertaining book..the plot was DEFINITELY different as were the characters and their backgrounds. I did enjoy this, but I didnt love it..I found myself setting it aside over and over..I just thought the whole vision thing was ridiculous. Also..I had a hard time connecting with the h/h. I didnt get a sense of their feelings or their passion for one another at all. I did not like Anne at all. I thought that she was annoying and full of herself. I enjoyed Horatio, but thought that his character was underdeveloped..all in all not bad, but could have been soooo much better than it was."
5,Snover's Biopsy Diagnosis of Liver Disease,"This is an excellent, well organized and concise text that is particularily useful to the liver pathologist both as a learning tool and as a resource for checking differential diagnostic possibilities. The organization and style are extremely practical for dealing with real time clinical correlative liver pathology practice."
1,Not good,This is not good for foreing people because it brings only phases not diccionary for the languages. i am really dissapointed.
1,Some Great Paul Davis Songs M.I.A.,"What? No ""Cool Night""!? Then this should not be called ""greatest hits"" album. Also, some song in his best-of singles cd are missing here."
5,A+,"Good condition, needed before the arrival tme, but was able to pick it up instantly, which was very great! I was able to walk in and just pick up the book just like that!"
5,flamboyant facial hair and so much more!,"Happy Birthday, Harris Malden is a wonderful movie, full of characters, dialogue, and themes, that everyone can relate to. The film takes an honest look at friendship in a close-knit neighborhood, and as a viewer, you feel for the characters as they grapple with insecurities and denial in and out of their comfort zones. All the while, the characters and the filmmakers have a great sense of humor making this a heartwarming, smart, & funny film. The guys in Sweaty Robot impressively created this movie from start to finish and I can't wait to see their next feature film!"
3,Great bonus tracks.Muffled sound on album tracks,"This is an album that you Hollies completists will have to buy twice on CD.The American CD of this album(on the ""Wounded Bird"" label) has only one bonus track,but on that disc,the 10 album tracks have crystal clear sound.Here on this import,you get 9 bonus tracks(4 of them new to the CD format),and fortunately,the bonus tracks sound decent,but the import has muffled sound on the 10 album tracks(with a marked loss of highs) versus the American disc.Why? Who knows,but the French ""Magic"" label has an inconsistent reputation where sound quality is concerned.As for the ""What Goes Around"" album,it is a reflection of its' era:Synth-Pop:well sung,but with little opportunty for guitarist Tony Hicks or Drummer Bobby Elliott(who is forced to compete with a drum machine) to strut their stuff."
2,Cynical Reunion Album,"The two stars for this record are for ""If The Lights Go Out,"" a wonderful slice of folk rock romance featuring Tony Hicks' chiming guitar and the only song on here that sounds like something the Hollies would have recorded (they did two years earlier--with Terry Sylvester) and that Graham Nash also might have recorded.The rest of the material is slick and shallow. The arrangements are heavy on synthesizer, light on Hollies. This group showcased its brilliance with arrangements on three previous albums full of outside material (""Hollies Sing Dylan,"" ""Romany"" and ""Buddy Holly"") but there's none of that here. In fact the members did not even attend the same studios to make these tracks.A Hollies fan will have to buy this album for the rare chance at the original vocal trio, but aside from ""If the Lights Go Out,"" there will be nothing here to enjoy aside from those voices."
2,WILL TEENS EVER LEARN??,"DEVIL'S PREY is not the worst demon movie I've seen, but it's certainly far from the best. The movie has a cheesiness that underwhelms the audience, and for the most part, the acting is subpar, particularly with Patrick Bergin and Tim Thomerson. Charlie O'Connell and Bryan Kirkwood do respectable jobs, but the girls aren't quite as effective. Jennifer Lyons has to be one of the whiniest ingenues in a while.The plot is mixed up, we never really understand what the devil worshipers really want, and every six months they get to kill people? Muddy, mirky, devoid of any real suspense. The ending is a howler!"
5,Cry of love is back,"Cry of Love after a brief hiatus (in which they changed lead singers) brought back the southern drawled rock that made Brother such a good album. The vocals are once again impeccable, but Freed's guitar once again is the driving force behind the songwriting and music. His guitar work is as innovative as the song content for the band. The crunchy guitar (with a few brilliant accoustic snippets) is only offset by his sense of melody and counterpoint. Buy this album without a second thought, and you'll not be disappointed"
5,Lightwave Tour Training CDs,"These training CDs produced by Larry Shultz are outstanding. Having a well known and respected industry professional share his tricks is a welcomed treasure.You will be walked through many of Lightwave's features and hidden tools. Did you ever wonder what one of those hidden tools did but you couldn't find information on them? Well, now you will.This is money well spent.Plus Larry Shultz welcomes questions about Lightwave. He is a passionate man about animation. Take advantage of the knowledge on these CDs and you will have an excellent incite into the depth of Lightwave."
1,Microdrive crash,"I purchased this microstorage product when I was out in California at FRY's in San Diego last november.... I was agog at the 4 gig capacity. It started runiing hot within the last week or so and increasingly so... totally by luck, yesterday I backed up the drive before I went to work... then while I was working on my PC at work runnig WinXP, it stopped.... it seemed for while it was partially working but then it died a hard death...I lay there sobbing and then realized I had the good luck to back it up at home... I went to my old 512mb flash drive and then to add insult to injury read these reviews... OMG!... am I lucky!... Thanks to all and to all a 2GB flash drive [hope.. I have to figure out how to go back to 1GBs]"
5,"Not a movie of today, but a wonderful sentimental journey.","The acting if good and the stories, although fought with dangers arerealistic to life in the country. If we are to go through lifeonly living for and watching movies made to please many of those whoprefer the world through a cynic's eye then we are doomed to miss a lot."
1,Total stretch fir beginners,The tape was faulty-couldn't use it-I was so disappointed-was looking forward to using this-I willNEVER buy from this person again!..
2,Defective DVD,I enjoy the exercises that this DVD offers and have enjoyed other fitness videos and instruction by Tamilee Webb. However this particular DVD is defective. I returned the first copy I received because the DVD completely cuts out the floor exercises. I received the new DVD and it does the same thing--it goes from the end of the seated stretches and skips to the cool down of the floor exercises. The actual floor exercises are missing. I was disappointed as the floor exercises were the main ones I wanted. I won't return the second copy since It still has the 30 minute flexibility workout on the DVD. But just be warned if you decide to buy it.
3,It's ok....but,I thought some of her stretches were a little difficult for beginners. A fit person will have no trouble at all with using this video. I just found some of the positions to be awkward and uncomfortable.
3,Good overall program,"This is a good overall stretching program -- a good choice for busy people because it's short. It's geared for people doing sports who don't have any problems. It's limitations for me is that each stretch is fairly short, limiting it's usefulness for sore, shortened muscles. Also, I wish it'd have more stretches for the neck -- only 1 of the 3 routines have neck stretches and they are very limited."
5,Total Stretch for Beginners with Tamilee,Excellent teacher and excellent exercises. Worth every penny and then some.
2,Not engaging,Not a big fan of this video. While she does walk you through many stretches she is not very engaging. It is very boring and not in a relaxing type of way.
5,great stretch!,"I love this DVD. It is very easy to follow Tamilee. She explains things very well. I do at least one section of this DVD right after I get up and it makes a world of difference in the way I feel. I also like it, because I can do the standing, sitting, or the floor stretching. It only takes 10 minutes to do one section. A whole workout is 30 minutes. I don't like to exercise when I first get up, but this has made me feel so much better. It is for beginners, so if you are a professional stretcher, this may not be the one for you. But, for the rest of us, it is great!!!"
3,"Good, but could be better","I have read a few of Joe Carr's books and I have a lot of respect for his work, but this book was a bit of a disappointment for me. The bias is toward amateur HF-band antennas, and I was hoping for better coverage of VHF, UHF and radio and television broadcast antennas in a book with such a broad-sounding title. Even some fairly well-known antenna types used by amateurs and scanner enthusiasts receive little or no attention. I have found the ARRL Antenna book to be much more comprehensive.A fair amount of the material overlaps with Carr's _Secrets of RF Circuit Design_, so bear that in mind if you already own that book. This book is still worth reading, especially if you work the HF and lower bands, but it shouldn't be your ONLY antenna handbook."
5,Inspirational Music,"I just starting watching these Gaither programs and got hooked! This DVD gives you the best of all the Vocal Bands have too offer. It's simply uplifting music that warms your soul. Since I have been disabled for many years now, I miss going to church. But this DVD and the others that Bill Gaither offers is a God sent. Anyone who is looking for GREAT, GREAT music, I recommend it. Keep singing Vocal Band, God has certainly blessed you..."
3,"Cute, but not very original","""Lucky Cow"" is set in your average American homogenous fast-food restaurant and focuses on Clare, daughter of the franchise owner. Clare hates her job and does her best to avoid work, complain and provide substandard customer service. Unfortunately, Mark Pett's attempts to skewer the fast-food industry grow stale fairly quickly, and the humor just isn't sustained through an entire collection.This is not a strip I'd want to see in my local newspaper, and I can't work up any enthusiasm to read another collection of these jokes.by Tom Knapp, Rambles editor"
1,Defective,"I bought this inexpensive guitar hoping to be able to have some fun, but upon opening the package, it was defective. Half of the tuning pegs did not turn. I read the reviews for other guitars by this maker and was disappointed to find several reviews with similar complaints. I advise you to consider a slightly more expensive guitar and pay a little more for the tuner, bag, etc.."
1,Novelty value? Not even worth that.,"This CD Single is basically a remix by Def America boss Rick Rubin. The main 'attraction' is the extended remix of We Will Rock You, which all credit due, is now pretty worn out now (Blur Song 2 anyone?). The track starts with an unfunny record scratch sound which can't help but annoy. It does however end in an interesting Brian May guitar loop, which while quite clever, is not redeeming.Buy the Hollywood version of News of the World - it's there with all is annoying scratching!"
3,Tough to get cake out...,"Wilton's OK stuff, but intricate shapes like this are lost without a perfect release. We followed the instructions, not once but twice and got the same result both times...parts stuck. Cake tastes the same crumbled and reassembled but oh well...you get what you pay for and the price is very low on this compared to others. By no means is this a substitute for heirloom-quality pieces made in the US by Nordicware, but may be a semi-frustrating, economical one-time substitution."
4,Good for a novice wanting to become a semi pro,"I picked up little, but it was entertaining and potentially a great resource for an emerging bass fisherman."
2,Book OK - Kindle Edition Disappointing,"This book is an interesting read for those interested in Bass fishing. Roland Martin has some good techniques and his writing skills are OK. Unfortunately for Kindle readers, the book has a lot of pictures which do NOT work well on a Kindle. Therefore, a lot of good information is lost because of Kindle's ability to show pictures."
2,Nothing new here...,"I really wanted to like this book because I grew up watching Roland Martin. Don't get me wrong -- it does contain some useful information, but like the pictures, it's 20+ years old. If you want to learn more about MODERN tackle and techniques, this is NOT the book for you."
4,great for coat and constipation,I give my cat one squirt on a spoonful of moist cat food. He loves it and eats it right away. Seems to have helped with his constipation. I would recommend this to anyone who has a cat with dry skin or constipation.
5,Can't use this as a bribe on my kitty...,"This looks like the real deal but I can't motivate my cat to eat it (or other things) on its own.This is something I'll have to sneak/integrate into other meals once I can find out what my cat is in the mood for.... her food interests have taken a dramatic turn so I've got to figure that out first. Then I think it would be easier to integrate this great oil into her diet.Of the various kitty things I've ordered for her health, I would definitely get this again as it seems very good for her!"
5,Works Wonders,My cat loves the taste and I saw a change in her skin and coat within just a couple days. I am pleasantly surprised!
4,Buy the one for dogs instead,"Good for your cat's coat if your cat will eat it. Some cats are fussy about their food. If your cat won't eat it over dry food, it's easier to hide by mixing in wet food. I like the easy dosing of the pump. Much easier than the old stuff I was using that came in a squirt bottle.My advice would be to try the small bottle of the salmon oil first to see if your cat likes it, then buy the larger bottles for dogs if your cat finds it acceptable. It's the same stuff, just less per ounce. Why they don't mark all the bottles for both cats and dogs makes no sense to me."
1,Over priced and don't work,My cat turns her nose up at this stuff. I guess it can't work it the cat will not use it. It is useless to me and my cat.
1,"Affordable, but cats won't eat it","I was hoping this product would be enticing to my cats with its yummy salmon scent and flavor. Unfortunately, my cats hate the salmon oil and won't go anywhere near it. I'm not sure if it's because they're not used to it, but they really don't want to eat it, so now it's just collecting dust in my pantry. At least it was affordable, so I didn't waste a ton of money buying it. Maybe someone else's cats would like it? Or a dog, maybe? Better luck to anyone else who buys this for their pets."
1,Wrong product,"The power cord that was sent did not work with the unit despite making sure the right item was ordered.Returning it would cost more than the product itself so we just are not pursuing it any further. It is sad to think that despite ordering it properly, we did not receive the correct cord!"
1,This DVD is an insult to Sir Alfred!!!,"Mr. Hitchcock made some excellent films. ""Frenzy"" is one of them. His technical hability and his talent for the black humor and, of course, the suspense was really remarkable.All was technique in his movies. Every shot was carefully drawn and filmed with great precision. That made his films to run like perfect machines, where every piece was in its place.And now, the bloody people of UNIVERSAL, with all his modern processes and his prepotence cut the shots of the film up and down to obtain an aspect ratio of 1,85:1 in which was not shot ""Frenzy"". All the work of Hitchcock has been sabotaged.What I mind if I bought a DVD called ""Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy"" more than any kind of extras, is to have ""Frenzy"" just as it was shot..."
2,not so good,"I do like Hitchcock and I have seen many of his films. Though most of them are brilliant and, more impotantly, origonal, I did not find Frenzy to be either of these. No, it wasn't horrible but it was not origonal at all. There is a murderer/rapest and, sure, we are all entertained buy that. The wrong person is of couse blamed, the bad guy is of course found out, and all in between that are scenes that seemed like Hitchcock had to force to make the film long enough. Hitchcock is wonderful but this is the worst movie of his I've ever seen. I'm sorry."
5,Another Great,"Continuing to utilize his infamous themes of mistaken identity and mix ups, Hitchcock puts Richard Blaney in deep trouble in this sexualized thriller.What if everything you said and did in a matter of a few days made you the prime suspect in a string of serial rapes/murders? Well, Richard Blaney runs for his life. Co-starring Barry Foster and Anna Massey (from Peeping Tom), Hitchcock gives us thrills, chills, and even some highly sexualized scenes.Not your typical Hitchcock, but it still employs his usual trademark plot points and ability to captivate and torment you. You will not be disappointed. Recommended for everyone, but especially for die-hard fans."
3,Good Hitchcock Fun!,"Hitchcock returned to one of his favorite themes in his movies,and also one of the most enjoyable to watch. That of the innocent man trying to prove his innonence. Barry Foster and Jon Finch are simply wonderful to watch in the master's second to last film. Hitchcock really made in a sense a ""come back"" with this film. Proving that he still had what it took to scare the living daylights out of us. But,of course this does not compare to Hitchcock's earlier masterpieces like ""Shadow Of A Doubt"",""Lifeboat"",and ""Foreign Correspondent"". A good movie to start off with Hitchcock films though and a good one to watch on a lonely Friday night with some friends. A very witty and suspenseful Hitchcock gem."
5,What should be tought in grade school,"This is what I tell my shaman clients about Animal Speak. Ted Andrews has brought the modern world, what every indigenous culture held as the most valuable information to learn early on in life. Ted, more than anyone I know, embodied this information, and shares it with great clarity and insight. This, and other of Ted's books, is the quintescential reference for having the best human experience you can. Everyone should own this book.Dreaming Your World Into Being: The Shaman's Secrets To Having The Life You Desire Now"
1,Animal Speak: The Spiritual & Magical Powers of Creatures Great & Small,"At first glance, I thought this book covered animals and their mysticality in an academic sense, but I was wrong. This delves into, specifically, Native American totem animals, and nothing beyond that. You got your wolves, eagles, bears, snakes, a few others, and that's about it. I was under the impression this book covered a multitude of animals, and discussed more than in depth descriptions of their importance specifically pertaining to the Native Americans and some rituals to attune yourself to different animals. Don't be fooled by the title, it does NOT cover all animals great and small, and neither of any outside of Native American spirituality.This is the first book I've ever deemed worthless, but if you're curious about a select number of animals in Native American spirituality, this may be for you"
5,For the Believer AND the Seeker,"I give this book 5 stars mainly because, like all Ted Andrews' books, it is written for both the Believer and the Seeker. The Believer shall find all s/he needs: this totem means this, that omen means that. Period. In this respect Andrews' books are somewhat simplistic.However, at a careful reading, the Seeker shall find interesting hints to deepen the knowledge about spirituality in nature."
5,I recomend this book to all my students.,"When I walked past this book it almost jumped of the shelf at me. I knew I had to buy it and since then it has been a very important part of my life. It has helped me understand many things about my self and the Animal realm. If you've never read it, reed it and if you've read it, reed it again, it gets better every time."
2,Amazingly Trashy From 1998,"People having sordid affairs appear with their loved ones on a talk-show host's popular, controversial TV program. Very trashy. Jerry Springer plays himself. I can't believe that he was going to campaign for US Senator. This is like the TV show, except the guests in this movie are actors.Drama/Talk-Show (USA 363/5)"
3,Funny,"I wouldnt put this down as a great cinema masterpiece, but it sure is funny and entertaining. Plus Jamie Pressley is hot in this movie."
1,Why did all the shocking info get left out?,This book is not worth buying because it does not complete the interpretation that it is a backstage uncensored pass to the Jerry Springer Show. It has about 50 pages about the show and the rest is about Jerry's life. Get this book from the library because once you read it you will be glad you didn't buy it.
3,For older child,I bought this game for my at the time 5 year old little girl.You have to be able to read in order to play this game. She did not know how to read therefore in order for her to play I had to sit with her and read every little thing.At one point in the game it tells us to go to a specific place and talk to a specific person and we were not able to locate this person therfore the game can not continue it's frustrating. however it is fun.
3,mostly talking not much playing,"This game was irritating becuase it kept me wondering, when am I going to actually do something? most of the game was talking to lilly, Jackson, and Oliver. The only fun part was when lilly is riding the bike, rollerblades,or skateboard, you can control her and make her dodge obstacles like the cats and garbage and sewers."
3,Needs More!,I am 10 years old and i love the show Hannah Montana so i bought this game.It only had 3 levels and at the end it's really boring all you can do is look for stuff and dress up Hannah.
1,"wow, I only thought the only bad thing about hanna montana were her songs and show. Appearently there is one more.","All I have to say is WHY. Why would disney make a stupid game like this, why would any selfrespecting game company produce this, and why would anyone want to play this! Who wants to play a game about someone who only thinks shes a pop star. Me being a gamer i am disgusted buy this pathetic excuse for entertainment.WHAT EVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY THIS NO MATER WHAT THE DISNEY CHANNEL TELLS YOU!"
3,"Read ""Welcome to the Monkey House"" instead.","Holy smokes, did that other reviewer really call the short story a ""few pages of scribbling""? The story ""Harrison Bergeron"" is a clever, unique, insightful commentary on society and education: hillarious and devastating at the same time. You should read something before reviewing it. ""Made for tv"" is all I have to say about the video: acting, writing, sentimentality are all par for the course, like it or don't like it."
2,What a mess this is.,"Do yourself a favor and rent this. When the photographer is not whining about his parents he is trying to be a talent scout to a kid who won a guitar center contest. The photographer works for Guitar center, BTW.Or he is trying to promote a band. Probably the most annoying thing about this picture is this very unattractive old mans ego. There is a close up shot of his face every 10 seconds. Imagine your grandfather dressed head to toe in Ed Hardy making an ass out of himself trying so desperately to be hip and you will get the idea. If you are a musician you will find this whole thing even more hilarious, especially the NAMM sequences."
3,OK,"I found the entire Conclave of Shadows series to be slow and semi-tedious. It seems like it is there to merely set up the rest of the long running series, so it is not as enjoyable as the others."
3,It is ok and was cheaper than a new bed...,nothing spectacular but it is helping my daughters back pain. will still get her a new bed soon but this helps for now
5,Provocative Tale,"A story of the Italy of the 1944, in which a young beautiful widow was making some money to survive from her attractiveness and a teen silently struggled with his sexually-motivated delusions she initiated.Some motives are similar toThe Tin Drum.A really powerful story of a real Italian life having then pushed so many as far as in Australia for reasons embedded explicitly with moviemakers.Highly recommended."
5,This is the one!,"Elsewhere, the Malena Uncut Special Edition 2 DVD Set is selling for around $70. This edition was $10 and includes everything censored out of the main release version. It's all there, the pubic hair, washing the breasts, etc.It was a pleasant surprise, too, that a woman as beautiful as Monica B brought solid acting talent to the table. She is simply amazing.The final scene, women in the marketplace, is poignant and touching and will stay with me for the rest of my life."
3,Angry and disgusted,"I have to admit my wife and I felt both these emotions after watching 'Malena' - I don't see any other reactions here expressing the same. How can you feel positive after watching a woman abused unfairly, practically raped and beaten for two hours? I was hoping a bomb would drop on this village of disgusting townspeople.The ending was ridiculous. The gesture of kindness was 'too little, too late', and I would have slapped that woman silly.I haven't been this angry after seeing a film in a while."
2,I learned more from the Lifetime channel...,"This DVD sucked and not in a good way. I purchased this DVD as a combo pack with ""What Men Want"" and I will never purchase one of the tapes in this series again. The things they did in this video were all common knowledge. I was looking to learn a thing or two and I learned absolutely nothing from these videos. The couples looked like they were faking it and the commentaries were pointless. I did more in the shower as a virgin with my boyfriend then these folks did. Don't buy this tape because you can get more knowledge from cable tv then these provide. I'm sure the average imagination naturally comes up with better stuff."
5,Subtitles rule,This movie is really good but some of it was confusing because i haven't seen the earlier macross movies.I think that the sub is better than the dub because the voices seem to fit with each character better.Overall it is a brillant movie with some really nice japanese songs.
1,This is a best of?,"This release takes a very distant second place to the Stardust Records issue ""A PORTRAIT OF"" which has so much more to offer."
3,This album deserves at least 3 stars!,"I had to write this review since the only other one rated this at two stars. This album is better than that and deserves at least 3 stars. This was a transitional album for the group for sure. It introduced Darren Wharton (Keyboards) into a permanent role with the band and without the experimentation that happened here, Thunder & Lightning probably would've never existed. Yes it plays with many different styles, but it is also unmistakably Thin Lizzy. It is true that Snowy White probably wasn't the best fit for this band while he was a member, but his contributions are still noteworthy. There is no Thin Lizzy record that rates less than 3 stars during the dual guitar lineups. This CD is essential in determining where the progression to Thunder & Lightning came from and is a worthy addition to any Thin Lizzy collection."
3,"good twists that keep you guessing, but...","this is not Hitchcock at the height of his powers. While this has more imagination that your typical caper film, somehow the characters and didn't grab me the way that I expect of Hitch's genius. Sure, it's fun, but there are are so many ""fun"" movies.On the positive side, there is no way to predict the outcome of this. You have some charlatans - a medium and her bag-boy investigator - who are trying to make a score. Then, you have the ""professionals"", that is, a genuine sociopath and his sidekick, the wonderful Karen Black in her prime. The mix is volatile, dangerous, and wonderfully unexpected as the plot reveals itself. It is very clever, but somehow not memorable, at least for me. I am sure I will forget the plot details quickly.Recommended. Anything by this director is worth a look, but I would rent it rather than buy it."
2,It's a Rental first,"Hitchcock was one of those rare directors I could buy any DVD at the store, without even seeing the film first, and KNOW it was going to be a worthwhile purchase. Sadly, Family Plot has broken that.Aside from the opening title sequence, it does not feel at all like a Hitchcock film, but rather a run of the mill talking head detective mystery of the 70s, with rather bland/dry acting. There is little of the Hitch suspense throughout, aside from a decent ending, it's fairly conventional and doesn't really scream Hitch at all - and in fact at times, feels more like a TV movie.Frankly I'd say this is a rental only and I'd save the cash for any of the other 60 films Hitch made. Transfer was a bit subpar as many of the blacks are washed out, which is odd since the film is not that old."
5,Little Feet is a Great Feat!,"I love this book from beginning to end. Each photo brought me back to my childhood memories and now I can't go to a park without looking down at those precious little feet. I reccomend this charming, little book for all my friends and family."
2,"OK, book",Book is OK. Nothing that exciting. I prefer the Lonely Planet or Bradt Guides. Some INSIGHT GUIDES A are interesting like the one for Pakistan and the one for India but this one is boring.
3,skip the middle,"When I picked this book up at the library, I was really excited for it. And I was still excited when I started the first section (there aren't really chapters, so page 1 to 12). But by page 10, I was bored. It's beautifully written, but topics and ideas and events are way too drawn out to keep my attention.Still, I wanted to know what happened, so I skipped to the back of the book and started on page 257 then read to the end. This lets you know just enough to finish the book and understand what happened. And the ending is perfect.I'm sure I'm missing a lot of important stuff that was in the middle, but for now, I know enough to be satisfied. I just don't think I'd be able to get through the middle."
4,The audio version is a wonderful experience,"Jilly Bond is quite a remarkable reader. She has created some rare moments. I haven't read the book, only listened to it -- I found it on CD in the library (wish Amazon offered the CD version) -- and I can't imagine another narrator bringing this text to such intimate life. Don't want to return it to the library.4 stars instead of 5 just because some of the detail got to be a bit much at times."
1,not 10 wide,Shoe was great condition but only gave 1 star because box said 10 wide but shoe was just a 10.. kept because fit ok.
2,You had better like matrix notation!,"Greene is a brilliant econometrician and this text offers a good treatment of the subject. The adherence to matrix notation, however, is cumbersome and often obscures the significance of the topics. This treatment of econometrics is not for the weak-minded and one should master vector notation before venturing into these dangerous waters."
5,bout dang time,"I had this idea, no really, well sort of, I used to say they needed to jump on the bandwagon and release all those great 80's-early 90's cartoons on DVD, And the 3 on the top of my list; Talespin, Ducktales, and (not yet released but hopefully soon) Gummi Bears. Buy them All they are great for the children in all of us."
2,Region 2 problem,I did not see anything indicating that the zone was not a local zone and I cannot play it on my dvd player!
4,"I went to see Antonio Banderas, charmed by entire movie!","What kid wouldn't like to find out that their ""boring"" parents are really secret spies? That's the premise of this movie and I thought my kids would like it although I'll admit I went knowing that I could stay awake looking at Antonio Banderas (a hunk if there ever was one!). But I was surprisingly entertained and charmed by the entire movie and found the child actors in this one nearly stole the show from Banderas. Unlike so many patronizing or just plain silly kids' movies, this one had wit, heart and a strong plot - and plenty of humor, too. I'm looking forward to owning this one on DVD when it comes out. A movie ilke this could become a family classic."
2,Appallingly Weird Rather than Adventurous,"After seeing the trailers for this movie, I expected an action-packed, fun children's adventure. I did not expect to find all kinds of truly weird and disgusting characters, a little like Tellytubbies on psychedelic hormones, and devoid of any cuteness to the point of being actually nauseating. (Anyone who in fact dislikes Tellytubbies should imagine something much, much worse.) While the casting was excellent, the props good, and the overall premise exciting, the actual villains of the piece were just not worth watching. With some rewrites this could have been a little less like a rampant horror film made into someone's twisted idea of a children's adventure, but as it is, I can't recommend it."
1,Terrible,"This film was made for kids, but not really good for anything. The comercails made it seem okay, but I find very mindless. When people say it's good for kids 13 and under thats an insult to Kids. This film is not for kids, but rather todalers if they don't get scared of the stupid thumb thumbs. When I saw I had no idea why I was watching it. After that I kind of felt depressed. I've seen more interesting things from movies not even shown in the theater. Any film could have amused children the same way this film had. For example I find disney's classics like the Jungle Book more bearable. Do not buy this film at any cost."
3,Great Family Movie!,"This movie is great for the whole family. The children will love seeing peers being spies. Great family relationship. Special effects aren't the best. Wacky plot, again, great for the whole family"
4,Mighty Kids Saving The World!,"These mighty kids are out to save their parents & the world from evil. It's a very entertaining movie for the entire family to enjoy. I've known several adults & children who saw the movie in the theater and have purchased the DVD for home viewing as it is fun, family entertainment!!Don't want to give away the plot but if you are stumped for a gift for a while, whether it be your own or someone elses, this would be a good movie to purchase as a gift!"
3,great movie but dvd is lacking in features,"I saw Spy Kids in theaters at the request of my little bro and we both thoroughly enjoyed the experience. So it was no suprise when we picked up the DVD to relive a great movie. Unfortunately, the DVD version of spy kids is just that: the DVD version of Spy Kids. Besides the obligatory DVD features (captions, etc.), there's absolutely nothing but the bare-bones original movie on the disc. With such a great movie, you'd expect some cool interactive materials but instead all that is presented is a shoddy title screen. If you don't mind the quality of the movie all that much, figure on buying the VHS instead."
3,It's not that bad,"A lot of people don't like this movie, and I can see why. Some things could have been better and some things could have been left out (I'm not going to go into detail). But all in all, It's really about family working together, and the whole unrealistic side of the story is what makes it fun. The tv show was neat even though the stars were mutated humans, and the spy - weapons were really neat and interesting and makes you want some of them yourself. Well, it's not a fantastic movie, and its not a horrible movie. It's an okay movie if you're older than 13. But for kids, they'll love it. Oh, and I would rent it, not buy it!"
3,Good for the family,"Not a bad little movie for kids entertainment. Silly, but I'll bet you think it's awesome if you're 10 years old."
1,More Proof that Adults Hate Entertaining Children,"Mom, Dad, buy ""Shrek"" instead. ""Spy Brats"" is an overblown, stupid, ridiculous movie not fit for brain damaged squirrels. Why does Antonio B. keep doing these bad films? What's his next project, sitcoms on the WB? Most intelligent children won't see much of the movie because they will be rolling their eyes in stunned disbelief instead of looking at the screen."
1,didnt catch my eye,"Honestly, I laughed about 2 times. I've laughed more times on Men In Black 2 and I saw the ratings. Oviously some of you didn't like it. Anywayz, I don't think Spy Kids 2 would interest me either. Don't get me wrong, I love action movies, but that movie stunk."
4,spy kids review,This item was in good condition. This seller shipped my this item quick. only draw back is the person didn't list that item was not a english/spanish spy kids dvd. seller needs to put a better description on his items he is selling but in all great item for the price.
1,TERRIBLE,"This is the worst film I've ever put my eyes on. As a matter of fact, I didn't even want to see this hunk of garbage in the first place. If it wasn't for my niece to make me see this..., I would have never seen it. This movie is very childish and ignorant. It is very immature. If I were you, I would never even think about seeing this movie. It is horrible."
1,The Scariest Movie Ever,how could you take ur kids to see this freakshow? Your Sick. My 7 year old son had nightmares because of those freakish creatures. Dont see this if u have kids. In fact dont see it if u dont have kids. In fact dont see it at all.and if u do get ready to be scared to death.
5,excellente,"this cd is the best of like 50 i own. pedro originnaly wanted like 11 songs but he didnt have enough money. that is to bad because we need more ""simple economics"" in the music world. people say this CD is depressing but it just helps me take things in. Whenever i am in need of an idea i put in ""winners never quit"" and i'll get an idea in that 35 min. of alone time. Pedro is the man and he should have a wider audience"
5,wonderful!,"All the above posters are true... this soundtrack is truly magical. The music is so delicate and playful, yet relaxing. Be prepared to listen to this one over and over."
3,tracks aren't in order correlating to the movie,"It's the only original score soundtrack I've known to do that. There doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to why it is arranged like it is. For example, after Beth's sad death, there's beautiful piano playing the theme, then the very next track is the Port Royal Gallop which romps about with nice tuba sound. Just all wrong!The music is beautiful, the album is poorly done.FWatson"
1,Complete waste of money,There are clearly design flaws in the charger and the batteries. I have yet to have any otherof my other rechargeable batteries read 0 volts and not take a charge. Several of myDigiPower batteries are basically useless (and they were expensive).At some point the charger fails and doesn't seem capable of detecting that the batteries need tobe charged. You insert spent batteries into the charger and the charge light blinks for 5 minutesbefore going off. The batteries are not charged.Took me a while to figure out why my camera did not operate for very long on these batteries.Spend a lot of $$ on DigiPower batteries and have the most dead batteries of any brand I've purchased.I eventually figured out that the remaining good DigiPower batteries could be charged in oneof my older chargers. It's not clear whether the charger is killing the batteries but othershave reported similar results.The circuitry to prevent overcharging in this charger is clearly not functioning.
1,Rechargeable Battery Kit,"I bought this item i didnt get to use it, the batteries never got charged and it has no instruction at all. I recomend you spend a little more a buy something that really works"
4,Jaws 4,"It's easy to be critical of this film, but overall I don't think it's that bad. The death scenes are great and besides when the shark 'stands' on it's hind tail and roars, it looks very good. It may not be close to as good as the others, but it's still alright."
1,the worst waste of time ever (well and jaws 3),"""agaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa""i screamed not at the scaryness of the film at the stupidness of it. the shark looks like a dead salmon on a pole and is sometimes balencing on the boat.the beggining just askes for troulble as the blown up,electricuted,frazzled comes back and chews up the kid whats his name.ellen broady has flashbacks of things she diddnt see.the film is awfull.i wish i was eaten by a shark then see this.""this time its personal""said the catchphrase.more like ""this time its stupid"""
1,"A Bad, Bad Movie","Being a big lover of the first Jaws and liking the first two sequels, I felt that I had to see the movie. With the exception of the opening sequence where Sean Brody gets killed, I just wish that I hadn't bothered. I remember the time when Roy Scheider refused to make this movie, and he made a good choice. I do admit that there are a couple of times in the movie where the acting was OK. I have only been able to sit through this entire movie once, and it was a waste of time (and I generally like bad movies). Definitely not a recommended film, if you have to see it, look for it on TV some Saturday afternoon, or late at night."
2,Bitten off more than it can chew?,"When the only good thing I can say about this film is that it's better than the abominable Jaws 3-D, things don't look rosy. True, this film has an excellent opening sequence, and the scene in which the younger of the Brody brothers gets chomped is equally effective. But after that things go downhill and you're left with something that feels like a Saturday afternoon made-for-TV flick or a film which has had the frightening bits removed by the censors. The plot is just ridiculous. How could a shark travel halfway across the world in a matter of hours? Why did Mrs Brody have flashbacks to events she never even witnessed? Why does the shark explode? The worst element of the film, however, are the 'character is killed but then miraculously turns out to be alive even though his death was obviously irreversable' scenes which really belong only in groan-worthy cartoons. The proposed Jaws 5 has never been made. Perhaps this is a blessing undisguised."
4,One of not many who enjoyed this film,I am a big fan of the Jaws series. Wasn't too fond of Jaws 3. Loved the first 2 and then it came down to this one. Did I like it? Of course I did. I don't go and question how a great white shark got into the Bahamas waters or anything like that. I just enjoyed the movie for what it was worth.
5,JAWS 5! (I AM COMMENTING ON A NEW JAWS 5 AND I GAVE IT 5 STARS OF EXCITMENT(:),This wasn't a great film but I want to talk about JAWS 5. Universal says that a JAWS 5 is in it's works but they will not use CGI for the shark. Instead they will try to make it look better than the previous 4 sharks. They say that Richard Dreyfuss (HOOPER IN THE 1ST MOVIE) may return. Hopefully JAWS 5 will be frightening and great. I think the MPAA will probably be aming for a PG-13 or R rating because nowadays they can make it a hole lot more gory sequences-and by the way they say it will be coming out in the summer of 2007. I CAN'T WAIT JAWS 5 I LOVE THE JAWS FILMS AND I OWN JAWS JAWS 2 JAWS 3 AND JAES 4:THE REVENGE(ALL OF THEM)(:
3,Very Stupid but Well Made Sequel.,"When Chief`s Brody youngest son died and killed by a great white Shark. Since Chief Brody died of a heart attack. Now Helen Brody (Lorraine Gray) is on Vacation with her oldest son (Lance Guest) in Florida. The great white shark has been coming all the way from Amity to Florida to Haunt:Helen Brody!Directed by Joseph Sergent made a watchable film but Screenwriter Micheal De Guzman writes the film`s plot unbelivable stupid. DVD's has an fine non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround Sound. The film doesn`t make sense whatsoever but Still, it`s delivers the Goods. A lot better than Jaws 3-D. Panavision. Grade:B."
3,Not the best,This movie is not very good because the shark looks way to fake. This movies plot is very unbelivable and very unrealistic. The shark is in Hawaii for god sakes it shouldnt be very fast because the water is warm and Great Whites are warm blooded and hence dont like the waters.
1,1 star for the shark effects,What the heck is this? This film doesn't even deserve to have the same name as the first one and another thing. It's scientifically wrong because everyone knows that there aren't any sharks in the mediterranean and how did he know that the family was having a vacation on the Mediterranean sea. It's pathetic because all the other Jaws movies gave you good information about Sharks!
2,Age,Should have read a bit more about when this was recorded. A best of from early in his career was not what I was looking for.
3,A Thousand Years and Hundreds (It Seems) of Kings,"David Willis McCullough has edited and combined many, many original texts of Wars of the Irish Kings (so goes the title) that can be interesting, frustrating, dull or very dull depending on the particular source used. It is a little jarring to go from one of the source writers to another as their styles are often different and the short length of the excerpts does not allow enough time to get used to a particular format or way of expressing ideas before it is time to move on. The flurry of names coming at the reader can be quite daunting, as well. The best and most effective part of the book are the brief introductions before each original source. They are concise, well-written and effectively prepare the reader for what is to come. The book does make me want to read further in Irish history to help fill in some of the gaps left empty by this book."
4,Irish Enthisiast,Well written and informative. A good collection of original texts from Ireland. Especially useful after reading a good ancient Irish History book.
4,The Irish,Interesting portrayal of the different leaders of Ireland. A book that I read because of my growing interest in the Irish heritage...Maybe that is because of my girlfriend...but definetly a book to read if you are either of Irish hertiage or like to find out about royalty.
2,Leak Master,"The first year it worked fairly well. It did leak occasionally, but the day after it's one year anniversary it just started leaking. Seems to be a back pressure problem.It never could make a cappuccino without leaking. I mostly corrected this by drilling out the pod holders discharge hole a few thousands. It helped but still leaked.When it works, it makes a good cup of coffee. I would have expected leaking from a cheaper (under $50) model. For $80, it shouldn't leak.I just made a cappuccino and got about 3oz in my mug and 4oz of water on the counter.If Consumer Reports rated this as a good value it's probably because they either received the unit for free, or Mr.Coffee is an advertiser of theirs.Spend another $20-$40 and get a real pod maker.I might try Senseo next."
2,"Great for two weeks, and NO support!!","I purchased this coffee maker and began making wonderful flavor filled coffee. I was very happy with the plain coffee. The Latte tasted like milky water, and the chino was weak and sickly sweet.Two weeks after the purchase it starts leaking during the brewing cycle and the pod holder refuses to open. I have now contacted them twice for a solution to this, and I have recieved NO reply. Nothing, zip.I have since found out that this maker is no longer being made and that this was a very common problem.I will buy another POD based coffee make, just not from the Home Cafe line."
