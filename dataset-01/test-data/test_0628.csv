3,it's a fun book if you like this kind of numerology thing.,My number came super close to my personality but that was about 6 pages of the entire book. So I am not sure it was entirely worth the money.
5,A very eye opening book!,This is a good book for anyone wanting to know more about their self or others. The book has lots of positive information plus points out the positive and negitive that is brought to us with our birthday number. It is very insightful and tells you everything need to know about your birthday number in detail. Lots of good information. This is the best book on the birth forse number that I have read.Happy reading!
2,I really don't get it,"Animal Collective seems to exert a strange power over its fans and critics. Some of my friends have become obsessed with this band, and one of them gave me this CD.On the first listen I was barely able to get through the first track. Partway through the second or third track I had to stop (seriously) and play Nirvana's *In Utero* very very loudly in order to clear my head.I finally listened to the whole CD at least once with my friends. I don't think I could have done it alone.Animal Collective is clearly talented, but this stuff is really regressed and disturbing. I imagine these guys on acid running around naked in the mud pretending to be five years old while making jungle sounds into a tape recorder.I hope I eventually figure out what it is about Animal Collective that resonates so strongly with their fans."
2,Poorly mixed,The main problem I have with this CD is that it seems poorly mixed. There is no sonic depth to it - all the sounds are flat and hard to distinguish from each other.
1,Sometimes experiments are failures,"I have always admired the experimental spirit in any artist. As a visual artist I am constantly trying new things in my work and every once in a while I stumble upon some new element or concept that withstands the ""look at it a week from now and see how you feel"" test. Other times I churn out pieces of junk which I spare the world from looking at. Animal Collective should have reconsidered releasing this often silly and pointless collection of sounds. It is an artistic experiment that failed. I hope this is only true about this particular disc (the only AC I have heard) as it would be a shame for someone to be consistently putting out pieces of artistic crap for any length of time and still be getting away with it."
4,I don't know how she did it,"I like this CD.Japanese lyric is not exactly translation but fits in music and still carry same feeling.Leigh Nash is great.I don't know how she did it but perfect pronunciation.down side of this CD is four deferent version of ""Kiss me"" in EPthat's too much kiss me."
5,One of the best synthpop albums I have ever heard,"When I first listened to this album, I was stunned. Wow. This is a good band. The emotion, strength, and beat in their songs is incredible. Ranging from soft and touching, to fast paced and powerful vocals... this is a true classic.Wolfsheim is a great duo, with Peter Heppner at vocals and Marcus at the keyboards. Together their musical genious and lyrical talent shine. They can create such a wide variety of sounds, it truely impresses me.Songs such as ""It's Hurting For The First Time"", and ""Once In A Lifetime"" come across with a well paced beat, with emotional vocals... and great instrumentals. It's quite a shame they haven't released any albums in the USA yet, although I talked to Peter Heppner once in an online interview, and he said he was planning on releasing in America soon. I sincerely hope they do.Go for this one people, buy it... it's well worth the money!"
3,Worth the price only if . . .,". . . you pay $0.01 for the album. Many complaints about the score-only release of THE PRINCE OF EGYPT were about the lack of some good cues missing from it. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, THE CHARIOT RACE among others were missing. Luckly, this promo includes two tracks that weren't released to the on the score-only album. ""Chariot Race"" is the action track every collector wanted. ""It is only Beginning"" is a good song too. Not sure what part of the film it is, though.If you decide to purchase this, it's worth owning if you really want those two previously unreleased cues. Pretend you're buying them from iTunes with artwork and better sound quality and you'll see it pays off. It helps that there's a musical cue from the film like ""Through Heaven's Eyes"" but it's already on the other release. As for the rest of the songs, I don't care about them since I'm only interested in the score. But for the price offered, I guess it doesn't hurt to own more music.Buy at your discretion."
3,So-so,"This is an ok album, not particularly strong, but not that bad either. It was released in early 1972 and peaked at 43 on the US album chart and would eventually be certified GOLD. It did better in the UK reaching 12 on the album chart. It produced one modest hit single ""Until It's Time for You to Go"" reached the top 40 on the US singles chart and top ten on the Adult Contemporary chart. It was also a top 10 hit in the UK. My favorite song on the album is an up-tempo, rockin' blues number ""I Was Born About Ten Thousand Years Ago"". ""Put Your Hand in the Hand"" is pretty good too. ""Hey Jude"" was recorded in the late 60's and it sounds like Elvis was just fooling around with it. His voice is really straining and he is making-up some lyrics. It should never have been released. The fact that it was, is just another indicator of how poorly managed Elvis was and how desperate his label was for studio recordings by him."
4,Great product,"There really isn't much to say about this thing. It does what its supposed to without problems. Fits standard router bits, and has good grips for maneuvering. The window on the front is large enough to see what you're doing in most cases, but you'll either want to work in a well-lit area or have a flashlight handy, because not a lot of light gets into the cutting area."
4,Skill Mitter,This reconditioned product is great except window hard to open and can not purchase straight & circular guide.
4,...Y NO ES POR MI.,"Ana Cirr√© makes me realized that still good singer/ compositer exist...her scent, her voice are amaizing, "" Nene"" ""El Cielo del Tibet"" ""Y no Es por MI"" ""Querido Jefe"" and ""Frio"" are songs really soft, comfortable and beautiful.But even i i think this is a good one record, have weak points in songs like ""Sola"" and ""Amor a la mitad""...If you want more than just latin pop, buy it this album. You don't will regret about it."
1,GARBAGE,"DO NOT BUY THESE!! Unless, of course, you like throwing away your money, or enjoy the thrill of potentially burning down your house. I wish I had seen the negative reviews on here before I purchased, I would have know these are unsafe and prone to failure. The module I bought worked for about 6 months, and then (like so many others) suffered a sudden death with a flash and pop, tripping of a fuse, followed by a burning smell and a cloud of smoke in my living room. All my home theater equipment went down when the fuse tripped, but luckily no was damage done there. The only thing connected to the module was a 60w lamp. And why would I want to pursue replacement of the item via the ""6-year warranty"" when it's obviously trash in the first place - give them another chance to burn down my house with another one of these ticking time bombs? Mmmm yeaaah, no thanks."
3,Where are the rest of the songs?,"I was really excited to buy this CD after listening to the clips but I was very disappointed to find out the songs are not made for dancing. Maybe teaching??? They are one to half minute long and as soon as you get into the rhythm, they start fading out and the next song comes. Really disappointing because the songs would be great if only they were full lenght..."
5,"Don't worry, they only kill the bad guys","Dramatic history and science of early America, when the Rockefeller Foundation decided too many people were dying! of mysterious things!The Intl Health Commission went after hookworm, malaria, and yellow fever, to eradicate them in the US.Interviews with scientists and doctors. Nicely fat book of thrilling story."
5,shoes wife loves,my wife has been wearing these shoes for around 6 years and buys a new pari about 3 times/year. She will be bummed when they finally quite making them and she has to switch to something else.
2,A few good ideas but a poor read overall.,"I picked up some a few tips on better putting, but a chore to get through the book. Poor organization of the material made some potentially good ideas alot less applicable because I just wouldn't wade through the book."
4,an okay product,"It is easy to apply and gets the job done, but really painful! I think i will be using this for a realllllllllllly long time."
5,Great Interiors of Savannah homes,"This is an book published many years ago, however it is a well-written book. The photos are lovely showing intricate details of the gorgeous Savannah historical homes. I recommend it highly."
2,Too wordy!!,"Although I enjoyed Underworld and to a certain degree The Body Artist, I find this book to be rather uninvolving. The characters are so muddled I couldn't separate Lazarus from Ezekial. However the latest scoop from Hollywood is that a johnaton Demme directed version of Mao II is already set to shoot with Kevin Spacey in the lead!"
2,Pictures too dark,"I guess I'm the lone ranger here, but, on the whole, I did not enjoy Moser's illustrations. The choice of subject matter was extremely idiosyncratic (he manages to get through all four gospels without illustrating miracles or parables) and the overall tone of them was exceptionally dark. This can be appropriate for the mood of a book like Jeremiah or Lamentations, but seems almost absurdly out of place when illustrating the Pauline epistles, which focus so strongly on God's miraculous gift of grace. The cardinal virtues of Christianity are faith, hope and love. Moser's illustrations, however technically masterful they may be (and they obviously are) do not contain the elements that have made the Bible a repeated source of inspiration and strength for two millenia. As such, they define a Bible that is interesting in its own way, but lacks critical dimensions that have been central to this book's longevity, impact and meaning for humanity."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for a book that gave you pointers and advice. This is a collection of original and translated patents. You're supposed to translated the original and compare with the translated version, thus ""self-training."" Hmmm."
3,Hmmm...,"The acting wasn't very good. Chuck's son can act a little better than his father. The story is pretty strange. It seemed like a mess to me. The villian in the film is a great actor, but the bad acting and the obvious really make this film lose its luster. The part where the three of them walk through the town like they're going to the OK Corral for a fight was weak and so cliche. I realized shortly after I started watching it that it wasn't going to be very spectacular. I guess I hoped it would get better, but it never did. On a good note, the music and special effects were pretty darn good (3 stars). If you like Chuck Norris then you might enjoy this film. Otherwise, I don't see much to like here. The film is a very strange way to get across a christian message and you'll be scratching your head trying to figure out what the writers were thinking."
1,Piece of junk,I bought this tuner when I bought my guitar and this darn thing don't tune right. Seems like it jumps all over the place and any noise in the background will make the tuner go off. I have to get a new tuner.
2,Horrible Tuner,"I take guitar lessons and between lessons I'll use this to tune my electric guitar, When I go to my lesson my instructor has to completely retune my guitar because it takes it so out of tune. It's a horrible tuner! I had my high E string replaced and each time I try to tune it it trys to tune it as a B. It's bad."
4,Interesting story,"I bought this after reading about the Titanic's last voyage (got into the sinking ship thing, I guess). While this book is quite short, I did enjoy getting the background story of the Lusitania and reading the details of the ship's last voyage. I must say I was horrified to learn that the ship sailed, with willing passengers, into an area where the danger of being destroyed was a constant threat. Overall, this book gave me an interesting, albeit sad, history lesson. I just with the book had been longer."
3,Plodding and dull,"I couldn't figure out why the murderer did it. Other than that, this was a lifeless performance. I liked ""Taken to the Cleaners"" by the same author, but here, I couldn't understand what the heroine saw in her lifeless love interest or how she could tolerate some of the other people in her life. Oh, well."
4,Cute,"Its a cute charm, but about a week after I had it, the middle jewel fell out and I had to super glue it back in. Its fine now."
3,"Good food, but you can't prepare it in advance","I would normally make my baby's cereal the night before for the next day. I mix it and put it in airtight containers in the fridge. I had no issues doing that with rice cereal or oatmeal cereal. But, the barley turns a horrible GRAY color if you make it in advace. Yuck."
1,Nothing more than junk!!,"I PURCHACED THIS DAIWA BLACK GOLD REEL FROM TGS OUTDOORS,AND THE DAY I RECIEVED IT I TRIED TO SPOOL IT AND THE SPOOL DID THE HULA. IT WOBBLED LIKE CRAZY AND THE LINE WENT ALL TO ONE SIDE. I CONTACTED TGS OUTDOORS THE SAME DAY AS IT WAS RECIEVED AND TOLD THEM THE REEL WAS TERRIBLE,AND ABOUT THE WOBBLE. THEIR RESPONCE,( THEY ALL DO THAT,IT'S THE NATURE OF THE BEAST,)IN OTHER WORDS,THEY ARE ALL JUNK,LEARN TO LOVE IT. I RESPONDED WITH, I HAVE A MULTITUDE OF REELS,AND NOT A SINGLE ONE HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE SPOOL WOBBLING ALL OVER THE PLACE.DID I HEAR BACK FROM THEM??? NOT A WORD. IT'S BEEN A WEEK,SO I FILED A CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY FOR THEIR TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,,OR THE LACK OF IT. I HAVE ALWAYS BOUGHT FROM AMAZON,BUT NEVER A THIRD PARTY PURCHACE SUCH AS THIS ONE,BUT NEVER AGAIN...DONE!"
1,Handle was broken after one week of use,The handle of the 1-cup was broken into three pieces after a little over a week of use. Very disappointed. Would not recommend.
4,Excellent quality,The thickness of the plastic is wonderful and splitting or cracking isn't going to happen in ordinary use. I am very pleased.
1,broken!,"I have had these cups for several months now. When I received them I was very satisfied with their sturdiness. They seemed solid. However, I have now broken the handles off of the 1 cup and the 1/2 cup. Those are the two that I use the most, but not beyond an average level of use. I was not measuring anything hard to scoop. I believe I was using the 1 cup to measure flour when it broke and today I was measuring rolled oats when the 1/2 cup broke. Bummer! I guess I'm going to have to get some heavy duty stainless set I will have for life."
5,Java Balm Rocks! It is THE only lip balm you will use again!,"I spend a fortune on lipstick, lip gloss, and other types of lip balm. If you are like me and always have to have something on your lips to keep them moisturized, Java Balm is THE #1 lip balm on the market today. They are a bit more expensive, but once you try even one stick, you won't waste a dime on any other type of clear lip balm on the market. It's super smooth, shiny as heck, and your lips look and feel silky and smooth (no waxy feeling whatsoever!). I highly recommend this product. I rarely leave reviews, but since no one else has, I felt it was time someone let everyone know this is THE glossiest, smoothest balm on the market...in mocha or mint! I love them both!"
3,"Bed in a Bag worth the price, regardless","The set is nice, but not top of the line. The ""reversible"" sheets are not what I consider reversible --but you do get two different prints on the same sheet--on the same side. Top half of sheet is one print, bottom half of sheet is a different print. Pillow cases dont really match anything, but sort of co-ordinate. Filler inside comforter has some lumps. However, overall, for the price, it is not a bad buy."
1,not visually appealing,"I had high hopes for this book but was sorely disappointed. The illustrations actually insulted my daughter (she's 5). After trying to find some sort of lesson amid the busy garrish pictures, and finding none, we decided we had better books to read. It is appearantly a story about punctuation marks that go on vacation with no lessons to teach whatsoever, though the claim is that you learn the punctuation's function from its personality in their postcards to the classroom. I beg to differ. Vague- AT BEST. We love learning from stories. We hated this book."
3,Very salty sport,"While this book certainly provides insight into bullriding, the bulls and the cowboys who attempt to ride them, the language is salty, salty, salty. In fact, downright foul. I don't recommend this as a gift to anyone who's looking for an ""edited"" story behind the sport."
5,"Bull Riding Fan Or Not - You'll Love ""Fried Twinkies...""","I LOVED the book. Not knowing (or caring) anything about bull riding, I was not expecting to get into it, but I did. Folks outside ""the sport"" should know what an interesting and fun read ""Fried Twinkies..."" is. I really developed a love for the riders and I was rooting for them. I wanted Moraes to get his third buckle but Lee was so deep and introspective, I was not surprised at how far he went. I couldn't wait for the end!! I was truly transported into a world I knew nothing about and it was really a full picture. I expected the cussing, drinking, etc., but the Cowboy Church, political/business takeover of the tour and even the story from the breeders and bulls POV had oh so much drama -- showing again how once someone or a group of someones finds a passion, it drives individuals and creates industry. Plus the search for the deep fried Twinkies at the concession stands was a hoot!!"
3,A mixed bag,"There is a lot of interesting information about how the PBR works, from choosing the bulls to how the riders get paid. It makes good background reading if you enjoy watching the PBR. However, his stories about the people involved came off like gossip tidbits rearranged and stuck together. Not untrue necessarily, but seriously manipulated. If you want general info and great atmosphere, this has it, but I wouldn't believe eveything you read."
3,Disappointing for an adult reader,"I realize that I wasn't the target audience for this book (I'm not a teenager), but I have to say that I found it to be a little derivative and boring. The idea was a good one--sort of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Hern the Hunter meet and clash. However, it was pretty gory and the plot was somewhat scattered. But if I was @ 15 or so, who knows? It might have been just my cup of tea."
2,Urban Shaman,"While the character is somewhat likable, the logic flaws made this a hard book to enjoy. It's just not ""believable"". Urban fantasy works if you can bring the magic in, hiding it just under surface, give logical reasons why most people don't see/believe it etc.. I bought this because people had liked it, but I'm sorry I spent the money. It's not horrible, but it's definitely a book to borrow, not to buy."
4,Celtic Gods and Indian religion in modern times,"Urban Shaman is a wonderful begining to what I hope will be an ongoing series. The main character of Joanne ""Siobhan"" Walkingstick, half irish and half cherokee, is a spunky heroine who has personal issues with both sides of herself. She is a flawed person coming into her own power, and place, in her world.In this novel she has to stop the wild hunt, lead by Cernunnos, from going on without end. This not just a fantasy but a very good mystery too. I liked the relationship, it not entirely friendly, that develops between Cernunnos and Joanne.Here's hoping for the return of Joanne, and if I might say so, the return of Cernunnos, and his wild hunt."
5,Excellent Standalone Tale or Start to a Series,"This romantic urban fantasy has great characters, a suitably apocalyptic story, and fine intermingling of Celtic and Native American myths. I enjoyed reading it and, when I finished, felt satisfied with how it ended and looking forward to the others in the series."
2,Simplistic,"I wanted to enjoy Urban Shaman, but frankly I found this novel to be rather clich√©. There was nothing inspired or original in a part native-American 'shaman' who encounters various supernatural beings in a modern setting. This theme has been done to death from comics to television, and this novel is no exception.What bothered me most about this novel was that it seemed so light. I had a difficult time taking this novel seriously, and deciding whether it was supposed to be funny or serious. Certainly it is not dark fantasy. But neither is it humorous romance. The closest writing style I can come up with is that it is like a `harlequin' novel. A novel that wants to be something strong, but is written to cater to readers who don't want a plot that's too involved or characters which are too deep.I had high hopes for this book, considering the glowing reviews here, but sadly it is just another c-grade novel with some supernatural elements thrown in to titillate the Anita and Buffy crowd."
1,Brainless fluff compared to the Queen's Bastard and sequel,"I was blown away with the very smart, deep game C.E. Murphy made of The Queen's Bastard and sequel but I've been incredibly disappointed in this, the Urban Shaman series. I read three and really wanted to like them because of the good characters, but the protagonist is just an accident waiting to happen. These books are nothing more than Ms. Murphy cashing in on the rage for alternate reality drivel. Frustratingly dumb fluff. A few authors do this genre very, very well but in this series, Ms. Murphy fails miserably."
1,Couldn't Finish,"I know many people won't review a book they never finished, because it's ""unfair to the author."" I'm not one of those. Because, I feel if I can't finish the book, that's a direct reflection on the horrible job the author has done. The book didn't engage me, didn't keep me turning the pages. I think it's completely fair to judge a book based on the fact that I COULD put it down, and did. I can usually finish a book in a day or two. This one, after over a WEEK, I was still only halfway through. Therefore, this book got one star from me. Confusing, formulaic, boring, repetitive, and devoid of any emotion whatsoever. It's a shame, really, because I was really looking forward to liking this series. As it is, I can't imagine finishing this one, much less reading any of the others."
2,Melody is Melodious!,"Psst! My Jamaican roomie passed this ""white gal"" a copy of this book for me to read on the commute to work. I tore through it in 2 days! It was remniscent of Judy Blume's adventures of young women coming of age in peculiar situations. But, the book's narrative voice is muddled, like when the writing moves from plot to brief prose to documentary explanations of Jamaican customs and back again. The author's power of prose has a way to go. I would say overall, it's a decent read for pre-teens, because well, adults used to more sophisticated writing will be let down by the distinct lack of voice and style. Advice: you can enjoy it after Judy Blume, but not after Connie Briscoe! And I hope that the author comes back for another try with even sharper skills, because she sure knows her material!"
5,Survival bag,Received when they said it would be here... was exactly what they said it would be... and I am totally happy with it...
2,Beware....OLD JUICE,"I tried this out the first day I received it. I put two sprays on, After about an hour it was gone. The next day I put on four sprays....after an hour it was gone. I have a number of different scents. All of which last me at least 6-8 during the day. The only conclusion I could come up with is that it's old. It's a real shame. I always enjoyed this scent when I was younger and was looking forward to wearing it again. Oh well...."
2,Really now...,"Do you look like this person on the cover? If not, you may want to rethink this book. I got it as a gift but plan on ""regifting"" it soon. It makes yoga a game of accomplishment rather than an honest practice for normal people. Interesting Asana is fine for those who are truly moved and have a body that is capible of accomplishing it, but the real goal of yoga is to help you do a practice that enhances your life, not to spend your life trying to accomplish gymnastics designed for young Indian boys. For a different view, take a look at ""The Yoga of Heart"" by Mark Whitwell."
3,Basic and easy reading,"It's not great history but it's short and readable and has nice pictures. I read a lot of history but I've always had trouble sorting out all those Henries and Edwards in between William the Conqueror and Henry VIII and this was a great help. It goes from William the Conqueror up to 1400, which is when Henry IV bumped off Richard II. It's only 117 pages, some of which are illustrations so you just get the basic stories of the kings and queens. There's a little about Wales and Scotland but, even allowing for its brevity, Ireland is short-changed. It reminded me at times of Sellar and Yates's ""1066 and All That"" which parodies potted histories and snap judgments and I don't know what professional historians think of its accuracy, but it does the job it sets out to do."
1,Not worth the money,"These earbuds re not worth the money, Cheaply made and bad audio quality. Do not buy! I would give it no stars if I could."
2,Too Wordy and Redundent,"Don't waste your time on this book. Author repeats himself, and covers a lot of stuff that are less relevant. Book not well organized."
2,Poor book for Exam,"What a poor book from Microsoft Press !!!! It is useless for exam 70-227. Tons of point are missing e.g. Application Filter , Rule application order (only outbound mentioned, no inbound) !!!! It also dont tell us whole picture of ISA architecture !!! Just learn how to click click click is useless !!! Dont use this book !!! Just waste of $$$ !!!"
3,"OK for the exam, will not teach you BizTalk","The book is OK for exam preparation. The exam has plenty questions on managing, securing and troubleshooting BizTalk server, and the book covers most of these questions. Also there is a reasonable amount of questions realted to development of custom components. Read the book twice, and you will pass the exam.However... This book will have no added value if you want to learn BizTalk, or if you want to get familiar with the more advanced options like signing, reliable messaging and clustering. The real-world stuff you will need when working as a BizTalk designer or engineer, is not in this book.Conclusion: only buy this book if you want to pass the exam!"
5,Cool music,They complement each other. The music mix is extraordinary. I got this cd two years ago and still love it!
4,Okay,"Didn't enjoy this outing as much as the ""Two Men With the Blues"" (or is it Two Men and The Blues?). Kind of disappointing, but maybe a second viewing will help."
4,a good mystery read,"Andrew Klavan's book Dynamite Road is a good read. Sthe story is good and strong, as well as intriguing.I enjoyed the book as will most mystery readers.EnjoyJ. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,interesting premise,"less effective execution. Let's try and get out of prison. The most silly solution, airborn rockets. And yet that's what this comes down to, and it's just disappointing."
1,These are re-releases,"If you already own the first two albums by this wonderful pair, you already own the vast majority of tracks on this CD. I agree they are completely wonderful together. But my excitement at finding they had released a ""new"" album was quickly put to rest. This is like a ""greatest hits"" selection from the first two. However, one or two tracks do appear to be new.If you are new to this ensemble, I strongly encourage you to buy this collection. If you already have their first two albums, then this is largely unecessary."
2,Not one of the best,"While the book's setting is historical, it relies too much on fictional major events (i.e., it rewrites history). It also makes the main characters bigger than life (too much so) and wraps together two plots, one on land and one on sea. The action at sea is a little sparse, and the author has people on both sides performing what seem like miracles. An interesting piece of fiction, but I prefer historical novels that do not do major rewrites of recent history."
2,I don't get it,"What is it with our Spanish film making friends? Their gay themed films are either filled with despair and tragedy or in the case of ""Spinnin"" have all these bizarre components that make you go ""huh?"" I don't get it. It felt like the writer was trying too hard to be ""artistic"" with the film. What was with the ""100 kisses""? Or having characters only the audience can see? It works great in Shakespeare, but felt like a distraction from the story in Spinnin. Was the writer just out of film school and wanted to show that he learned all these story telling techniques? The only saving graces of this film were: the sexy main characters often seen lying naked in bed, and the message that gay parents are just as good as straight parents. I'm giving the film an ""ok"" rating. If you're kinda bored and want to see an artsy Spanish gay themed film, then go for it!"
4,Excellent resource,A superb look at the history of cartography. Johnson begins with some of the oldest known maps and ends with some of the most up-to-date technologies used in mapmaking. In the middle the ways that map making has evolved over the centuries are addressed. This is a wonderful resource for research or for anyone who is interested in this topic.
5,Beautiful,I put this near my mothers pic after she passed an every holiday she gets her own personal flower from me I just love it thank you so much
3,Not happy with disc 10,Disc 10 story 1 was not as high in video quality as the rest of the discs. It seemed to skip more and lacked the playability of the rest of the discs.
1,Don't be fooled: you have to pay to send your samples mailed and tested!,"There are other water test kits that let you do what you need to do, but this kit requires you to mail your samples to a lab and pay them more than the cost of the kit to get your results. This should be clearer in the product description."
4,Tracfone C 139,"I have a Motorola C 139 Tracfone which I bought for emergencies since I have a heart condition. I have found the phone to be reliable and sturdy. I dropped in on concrete twice and never phased it. I can hear better on the Motorola C 139 then I can on my land line house phone. I text message which is great because I'm partially deaf. It is basic phone, but for what I use it for, it is just what I need and at $6.66 dollars a month I pay for service, you can't get one any cheaper that works as good."
3,Never pass the airtime due date,"If you do decide to buy this phone, never let the airtime due date pass. Every time you add minutes to the phone it adds a certain # of days to the expiration date of the minutes. I barely missed the date and it has been total chaos trying to reactivate the phone and buy airtime since. We've had to call customer service several times to try to get the phone working again. It's still not working at the time. Well, if your commited to not letting the expiration date pass, then I would say it is a good phone. If you don't need all the extra features like web access and things, I would considerate it a good, simple, easy-to- work-phone."
4,Big Picture,"This book offers a good overview of the construction of various obstacles, ramps, mini-ramps, and bowls. With a basic understanding of carpentry you should have no problem building from the diagrams shown. Even if you do not have a basic understanding of carpentry, I would follow the books advice and start with some of the smaller/simpler ramps. They will prepare you to work through the more complex problems that come along with more complex ramps. Be ready to encounter small headaches and detailing problems along the way and you should be able to complete your project with your sanity fully intact."
2,Paint chips easily,"Same experience as previous reviewer, paint chipped the first time my baby put it in her mouth. Not much of a clacker either, not easy for a baby to manipulate."
4,So that's how you do things in MetaStock!,"Well I got the software and then sat and wondered what to do with it. When I couldn't find the appropriate 'Dummies' book I stumbled on this little gem. A quick check of the TOC showed it was going to tell me what I needed to know. No, not how to trade (there are thousands of other books for that), but how to use the software. The book showed me all the basics of using MetaStock, step by step, which was exactly what I needed. Now I know how to create a template and layouts and as for those cutom buttons, what a time saver! Overall....well done!"
5,Great recorder for the price,"Works well and has all the features I need. The sound is clear and it holds a lot of voice memos. I use it to record things I think of while in my car - reminders, business ideas, to do list, etc. Battery life seems adeauate also."
3,Reading Memory Stick,"I am not sure of the compatibility of reading all brands of Memory Sticks. I'd say it reads my Lexmark 128MB stick 90% of the time, the other 10% of the time it would render the Memory stick unreadable, even by the digital camera. An error message on the camera would read Format Error when placing the Stick back in the camera after trying to read it by SanDisk. I've never gotten that error if the camera read the Stick on its own. I'd then need to format the stick with the camera thus loosing whatever images I have taken. I have a Sony DSC707 camera."
4,slow moving field with lots of legacy code,"No previous coding experience in Fortran is assumed by the authors. Actually, no previous programming in any language. Fortran is quite easy to learn, compared to others like C++ or Java or C#. The book explains the differences between the 4 major recent versions of Fortran. Though some of you might quibble as to why the book even talks about Fortran 77. That originated in 1977!But the sheer mass of legacy code means that a lot still exists in F77. This market reality also has job implications. Some Fortran jobs will necessitate you being restricted to F77. Or F90. Hence the book's support for these. At least it does not talk about F66!"
4,The only thing to attach the twin lights,I use this adapter ring to attach my Olympus twin flash unit. I use it for taking macro shots. It works well but the attachment to the Olympus 50mm macro lens is imprecise. It is mostly a friction fit and it is easy to misalign it to the lens. It also is not adaptable to fit other lenses I might use it on. It is pretty much purpose built for the Olympus 50mm macro lens. Unfortunately it is the only adapter I could find for my twin flash unit. I took off one star for the imprecise fit to the lens.
5,A must for every little girl,"The purse is terrific! My 14 month old loves to play with every toy in the purse. She puts the lipstick on Mommy, Daddy, and the dog! She also loves to talk on the phone. The only drawback is that she can't open the purse or the change purse by herself. I am sure it will only be a matter of time since she can open the ""baby-proofed"" kitchen locks."
2,Was Curious,"Not having cable/satellite, I was aware of this show and curious about it. Boring, predictable and somewhat unlikeable charactors in an Antiques Roadshow type-program. Not offensive, but pretty darn boring and predictable."
4,The Original,"Nice to see where it all started. Chumly is in full force in the starting episode. If you've been watching Pawn Stars, you should like this one."
4,So far so good!,"I got this for $69 from amazon on a sale and am quite happy so far. I leave it on trickle charge as the instructions say this is ok. Plenty of power, twice what my old Makita 9.6 volt had but about half some of the high end 18 volt Makitas or similar. Still for a homeowner like me, it works fine, it is small and pretty light. I don't know how long the battery will last but I am going to try to install a new one when it goes. Be aware, the battery is built in to the unit, I guess you are supposed to dump the whole thing when the battery finally dies, we'll see how easy it is to replace. The chuck works well, controls work well on the drill also.Edit: Still no problems, plenty of power, long battery life."
3,Great Rent; however I would not say it is a classic,"I really enjoyed this film as it had some great themes and was not another guns blazing, provocative film. I would suggest that families with teens use this film as a good conv. starting point as Crazy Joe might or might not be a great role model without a good film debriefing. I would say that the rental quality was pretty good;however, I would probably go with HD next time because the quality was questionable at times.Thanks for your time!"
5,Excellent movie,"Whether this movie happened like the real thing or not, it was a great movie. Morgan Freeman did a superb job! I don't believe of those things happened, but the movie was great."
2,Sledgehammer Production,"Just because it's an inspiring story does not make it a good film. This one is so overproduced and lacking in subtlety I almost turned it off in the first three minutes, but decided to give it a chance.Caught somewhere between a hip-hop video and an After School Special this film lacks almost any kind of deft story telling. Full of cliches, preachy rage, and bombastic dialogue it sometimes seems like it was really a student project with a big budget.If you don't want your classroom inspiration hammered over your head then rent a classy film like ""Stand and Deliver"" or ""To Sir, with Love""."
2,Problems for migraine headache victims,"I had to stop taking this, as it seemed to increase the frequency of migraine headaches."
2,game with little math,"My son, 4, likes to play this because you can get shrek to jump around in a dungeon. OK, he is chasing quarters and dimes, the numbers add up, etc., but the math is not central to what he is doing and can be ignored. (It is ignored.) Must it be that way for one so young? I think it is too easy to say, well, I guess there is no alternative to just playing. THere must be a more imaginative way to stimulate a young mind in math. I believe this fails - there is no sense of ongoing game, no true link to math concepts.Not recommended."
3,Good - only if you already have good NiMH battery base,"If you also have to buy NIMH AAs (or more AAs) and/or a charger. DO NOT BOTHER IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. You are better off buying one or more (3 for me) EN-EL7s. The price is way too high to buy this without an existing NIMH AA infrastructure (even despite the much lower cost of NIMH batteries, about 35% by watt-hour unit)If you are like me, and you have 2 2 amp (Ray-o-vac 1-hour) chargers and 3 dozen recharchable AAs already (GP most economical), it is better to get this and use your AAs as the same AAs also powers my gameboy, toothbrush, remote control hovercraft, CD MP3 player, etc... when i'm not using the camera and also it spares you a cord and an adapter in your travel luggage."
4,It's exactly what I wanted,I'd give it five stars if it had a back light or indeglow feature. But it acurate and not in the way.
5,THE BEST BOTTLES YOU CAN BUY,"MY SISTER GAVE ME A PACK WHEN SHE STARTED FEEDING HER DAUGHTER WITH THESE PARTICULAR BOTTLES. MY DAUGHTER HAD A PROBLEM WITH GAS WHEN I USED THE OTHER BOTTLES, SO WHEN I STARTED HER ON THE VENTAIRE SHE NEVER SEEMED TO HAVE A GAS PROBLEM... THEY WERE AND STILL ARE THE BEST BOTTLES. I WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE THEM."
2,Difficult to clean; Didn't reduce air,"I received these bottles as well as the Avent bottles as baby shower gifts, so I used them interchangeably. The VentAire did NOT reduce the air in the bottles at all. There was just as much air in these bottles as in any other brand. An additional problem was in cleaning these bottles. There are grooves and little raised decorations all over the bottle, and little tiny drops of milk get trapped in there, even after hand washing and machine washing. Mold quickly grows in these little grooves. The Avent bottles were completely smooth inside, so they were very easy to clean."
1,Improper photos,"I like these bottles very much for my 6 month old son. However, the picture they displayed does not come close to the colors they offer. I wanted navy, green and dark red. When my bottles finally arrived I had a three pack of blue, green and purple. Along with three individual wrapped bottles of 1 purple and two pink. This is not what I wanted to order."
1,Are we the only family these don't work for???,"After buying ten packs(on top of the ones that came with the bottles) of the nipples for these bottles, we gave up and used our Advent bottles that we didn't want to use. For some reason, no matter which store purchased at, every nipple (Stage 1 and Stage 2) seemed to not be opened to allow milk to come out. Our daughter has some serious suction, so I thought that the Stage 1 was already outgrown and tried the 2. These bottles and nipples have been just a waste of money for us. I am sure that I can use a straight pin and open them more, but ""you're not supposed to""..."
1,Ventaire Bottles,"I purchased the ventaire bottles before my baby was born. I am a mother of 5 children and playtex products are a comman name in our household. We used the ventaire bottles for 5 weeks before process of ilimination brought us to the bottles. Our son had so much gas and stomach pain we had to go to our pediatrician for advice. We tried gas medications and home remidies nothing seemed to work. After 5 weeks and countless changes we switched to a regular plastic bottle with the playtex nipple. The gas went away and we now have a very happy baby. Not to say this bottle story will help all babies with gas that are using the ventaire. It might have been how our baby drinks, and the regular bottles just seem to work with him better. I will as always continue to use all the great playtex products just not the ventaire. If you have an address I could use to send them back for a refund to use towards a different playtex product it would be greatly appreciated. Thank You. Lisa"
5,---Mommy & Baby Luv VentAire!!!---,"I am a first time mother of a 3 month old, and I actually chose these bottles by chance while shopping...I am so glad I did! Other bottles that were given to me as presents don't EVEN compare. The VentAire bottles work GREAT for us...he has barely any gas, and burping is easy. I like the colorful lids and bottoms, and enjoy mix-matching them. The only downfall is that cleaning has one extra step and that is separating the special seal from the bottom lid to clean properly. Otherwise they are great and worth that little bit of extra effort to keep his belly happy! I highly recommend them!"
1,bottle basics,"I recently started bottle feeding my 7 month old. These are the first bottles i used. I don't think they are very breastfeeding compatible, because of the shape of the nipples, I had a hard time getting my baby to drink from them. She finally accepted them, then they started leaking out the bottom after using them for about 3 weeks. They also are a pain to take apart and put back together. However, I did like that you could get the bottle brush through the bottom, otherwise I would have never been able to get the brush through the top. I also think these will be easier to hold for little hands, because they are skinny and light weight. I have tried several other brands and found bottles that I like much better. I will keep these, just as extra bottles to use in a pinch, in case something happens to my new bottles."
1,numbers work off in one week,"These bottles are a pain in my you know what. The numbers all wore off within about a week of using them so I have to use a measuring cup to measure the amount of water I'm putting in. Other than that, they are OK, but I don't see a noticeable difference in gas or fussiness when I use them instead of other bottles."
2,Not good if your baby doesnt have gas problems,"I bought medela and ventair bottles when my baby was born (hes now 3 months). they both came recommended by our breastfeeding class's teacher. my baby doesnt really have any problems with air bubbles, gas or spit up so the ventair was just an extra hassle for me. you cant pump directly in it, or shake the bottle too hard cuz the milk can leak out of the vents, and sometimes a little bit of milk gets deposited under the vent. since its my breast milk, i hate having to let it go to waste. Not a big fan of the nipples beings so thin either. and u cant use them on any other bottles cuz then it takes the baby ages to drink from it (they're designed specially for the ventair). and it doesnt even come with lids! even the caps are not that good.the only thing i like about them are the shape. easy to feed the baby with.all in all, unless ur baby NNEDS airvent bottles, i wouldnt recommend it. im sticking to my medela bottles!"
2,Difficult to wash than other bottles,"These bottles are difficult to wash because there are more parts than other bottles. Also the parts are small and tend to fall off racks in the dishwasher more easily. I've also had issues being half awake in the middle of the night and trying to reassemble the bottle where if not screwing in the base properly they will leak. More parts = harder to clean and more complexity to assemble. Simple is good, especially at 3am in the morning when your brain is just not on. I really like our breast flow bottles which are more simple to assemble and are less likely to leak."
1,A pain to clean! Not worth the hassel!,"these bottles are a nuisance. I dread cleaning them. The screw on bottom gets build up of milk and you have to thoroughly scrub the bottom, rubbery washer and bottom rim to get all the crap off. My advice to someone looking for a good bottle is to find a bottle with as few pieces to clean as possible. My choice is the Avent, its more expensive but worth it."
1,My poor Baby,"When I brought my son, Andrew home from the hospital, I had these Playtex bottles waiting for him. My poor baby must have sucked for a good half an hour to get 1 ounce of formula out. The next morning my husband went out and bought the healthflow munchin bottles and we had a much better night. I actually ended up using Avent bottles because I found their flow to be the best. Please do not go through a first night at home like I did!!! Stay away from these bottles."
5,After much research...,"These bottles were sitting in the back of my baby's closet since he was born. I didn't think I would actually use them and it was too late to return them. After trying out the Dr Brown bottles, the Avent, and other miscellaneous bottles, I decided to give these a try. I didn't think the whole concept of an open bottom bottle would work and thought they would just leak all the time, but I was wrong! My baby is now 3 months old and a few weeks ago, when I had bought the Dr Brown's bottles and used them, he wouldn't spit up at all, but he had MAJOR gassiness! He would have violent burps that seemed to hurt him! So I took the ventaires out of his closet and used them. NOT A SINGLE COMPLAINT! He was very content with them! He finished his whole bottle, sometimes you don't have to burp him and he never spits up! I didn't think something so simple would work! I only have three of these bottles, but I'm about to go out and buy some more! THEY REALLY DO WORK!"
5,Figured it out!,"We did have a little trouble with the bottle leaking at first. What I found that works is, once the bottles are dry, assemble. To assemble the disk in the bottom cap, just wet your finger and run it around the outside of the disk twice as you are pressing it into the bottom cap. It has worked for me. Just a suggestion!"
2,A lot of parts and a lot of effort for baby.,"A friend gave us a set after we were no longer able to nurse. The bottle only works for our son (3 mo.) when he is very focused and hungry because he has to suck correctly to make the vent work. Most of the time he is pushing air back in through the nipple.Also, there are 5 parts to clean, the vent cap, the vent, the bottle, the nipple and the nipple ring. This makes a very full basket in the dishwasher or a lot of parts to find in a soapy sink.Would like to change systems when he grows out of the small bottles."
3,Slight nipple problem,The newborn size 1 nipples don't let enough milk flow for a newborn. You have to poke another whole in the nipple. THe size 2 nipples flow too much for a newborn. Other than the slight nipple problem the bottles are wonderful. They help prevent the baby from sucking too much air.
3,Not for a newborn,"First, these bottles come with stage 2 nipples...I had to buy the stage 1 nipples seperate (I know I will get to use the stage 2 eventually, but all my other bottles come ready to use with stage 1). I started using them with my son around 7 weeks of age. He had a really hard time getting the formula out of the nipple (stage 1). It seemed to take a lot of effort to do all the sucking (the nipples dont leak when you turn the bottle up side down). I think these bottles will be better when he is older and can use extra energy to suck alot more (and harder) then with 'normal' stage 1 nipples."
2,Budge Outdated,E.A. Budge was considered a great writer in his day but lately scholars are tending to lean away from his work due to more recent translations that are more accurate that his old ones. If you are looking for a book to learn hieroglyphics from I would try one of the many other ones.
3,a bit heavy...,"My daughter likes when I make it clack at her, but other than that, she shows no interest. Its heavy for her to manipulate on her own. I think my other daughter would have liked this more at her age. All kids are different!"
4,"If you love the Park, you'll appreciate the book",I started this a few years ago and set it aside. I finished it up recently. It was well written and covered so much of the history in a way that wasn't just names and dates. I enjoyed how it interleaved some interviews and other approaches to presenting the information.
4,The best production of this classic that I have seen,"If we judge a movie not by the script alone but by the acting, costumesand scenes, this movie has it all.Everyone has the book to start from in making the movie:some have chosen to make a children's movie and made vanilla pirateswithout the violence or language of the original.I think this movie with some realistic blood and gutsfilming is more faithful to the originalthan any other version that I have seen.I liked the movie."
5,Missed the DVD Release?!!!!,I can't believe I missed the DVD by just a couple months. I have scoured the internet and stores for a DVD copy of this Treasure Island and noone has it. Does anyone know how to sign up to be notified when it becomes available again?
2,Doesn't dry too well,This is a thick enough towel but it does not dry you off very well. I was disappointed in these.
3,vitamin review,Its a multi-vitamin for women. I havent seen any change in me. I dont know what else this is supposed to do. I'm hoping this is giving me what I'm missing. I dont know what else to say.
3,An OK vitamin,"I have trouble swallowing large pills and these are so large that they often make me gag on the way down, or I won't be able to get it down at all. I've never noticed an improvement in my energy or anything like that when taking these, but really I'm not as consistent as I should because I dread trying to choke them down. I say go for it if you're an expert pill swallow-er, but if you don't like big pills pass these by and look for something else.Note: Some people have been saying that these vitamins make them nauseous. This only happened to me once and its when I took it without a belly full of food like you're supposed to. I just took it with an orange and thought it would be enough. It wasn't. Make sure you have a good amount of food in your stomach when taking a big multi-vitamin like this one."
2,Tough on the Tummy,"You absolutely have to take this vitamin on a full stomach. Often times my breakfast would finish digesting before my vitamin and I would feel nauseous until I ate again. I took this vitamin on an empty stomach once and was sick 10 minutes later. Now I take Rainbow Light's Prenatal One. I find that the prenatal vitamins have tons of good stuff for you even if you aren't pregnant, and they make an effort to make it gentle on your stomach since many women have morning sickness."
4,"An excellent, though old-fashioned, scholarly edition","This truly is a superb edition of Beowulf. Especially convenient for me was the full analytic glossary: being able to look up other instances of words I came across was a great aid in learning the vocabulary and understanding the poem. The only unfortunate thing is the age of the book: it's over fifty years old and there has been much interesting Beowulf-scholarship since then. But still, an essential book for anyone interested in the poem."
2,reissue of Moment of Truth,"This cd is has the same 10 tracks as her second album Moment of Truth. Not one of her stronger albums. If you like Aces, Voices On The Wind or Somewhere Between then I doubt you will like this. This is the album that she tried to go mainstream and let others take control. It did not work and she came back artisticly and commercially with her follow up disc. Since I believe Moment of Truth is out of print this would be the chance to get it, or just find a used copy."
4,SQL Server 2005 Administration,Very good primer for Microsoft SQL admins. Not too detailed but complete enough not let the reader into complacency. Authors recommended detail topics books are very helpful. Also the technical support from their WROX.com site was welcomed instead of working a accompanying CD.
3,"Good book, could be better","I have been in IT for almost 10 years and recently read several books on SQL Server, including this one.The book is well-written, has no spelling mistakes, etc., but it has too much ""fluff"" in the text while not providing enough information on many topics. The author starts talking about a specific topic, then says ""this is beyond the scope of this book"" and this pattern occurs countless times throughout the book. At the same time, the author discusses a lot of unrelated topics and philosophical issues. When I buy a book on SQL Server Administration, I don't want to read about Uncle Scrooge, Bill Cosby, Star Trek, Mr. Spock, co-workers mouse clicking habits, and other unrelated topics. Being a DBA is hard enough in the current market, so I wish they would concentrate purely on SQL Server."
3,Interesting but not persuasive,"Ulmer is the kind of guitarist/musician that always engages you, but this album lacks the visceral power and, imagination of his solo ventures of the time."
3,What's The Use,"What's the use of buying a DVD version of an opera if you have to close your eyes to enjoy it? The cast in this production is excellent. However, the sets by Erich Wonder, costumes by Susanne Raschig, stage production by Luc Bondy, and choreography by Lucinda Childs are all awful! When you think about it, you have to wonder how hard it must be for the Royal Opera to find people who understand the opera LESS than any street amateur. My three stars all go to the wonderful cast; none to those who directed them."
3,Quality not great!,"The cross has separated from the chain several times. I have almost lost it, then had to use pliars to attach it back on, but the little ring that holds the cross is too flimsy to hold up and the cross is easily pulled off again. It is very attractive, but needs a better ring to hold it together."
5,One of the most useful textbooks ....,I used this textbook for my MBA Human Resource Management course in the spring of 2001. I found the textbook quite up to date with great case studies and end of chapter exercises. They were quite relavent to current issues and the ongoing AOL-Time Warner case was an used throughout the book.
2,"Recommend HK, but not this DVD player!","Bought this item to match the AVR645 receiver and use the HDMI feature. HDMI feature works fine, but the dang thing skipped or acted as if there were scratches in about 3 or 4 parts of a new release movie! Checked the DVD after, and no scratches whatsoever! I know my old JVC player would have never done this! Very disappointed. Several other DVD's and the same problem. Oh, and the fast fwd/rewind feature does not stop in the spot you would expect. WTH? I am calling regarding replacement tomorrow."
2,Windows 2003 server unexplained,"Included lots of buzzwords that microsoft likes to use. Mostly worthless. Windows uses plenty of tools under the hood to manage a server most of which remain unexplained. The book explains very little in terms of licensing installation, updating the system without using AD and simpler configurations. While the OS is partly to blame the book is not exactly a help in this scenario either. I've been burned by too many of these lightweight ""technical"" books from the big publishers. SAMS especially. This book explains lots of terms but then does very little in explaining practical system configuration in real terms. I get more from MS help."
4,Sturdy,"We bought this for our daughter, it is sturdy , easy to put together and light so easy to move around. I love it bright and simple. Something she can use for a while and we can paint later when shes to old for the crayola look . She likes it too."
4,HP 8430 Laptop Extra Battery,Shipping and price were Amazon fast and friendly. No surprises. The battery works great but adds more weight to an already heavy laptop.No complaints.
2,Not so good...,"The quality of this tea is not very good, especially compared to other superb teas by Two Leaves and a Bud. Mostly powder inside the bag, and has a very strong ""grassy"" smell and somewhat bitter aftertaste.On top of that it took 2 weeks for Amazon to deliver it."
2,A DISAPOINTING PRODUCT,"I expected that it would test ""C"" & ""D"" cells...it does not. It does an OK job with AA & AAA & 9 volt. It does not inspire confidence in the resultant test. It may be just my suspicious nature."
3,This thing is like a Magic 8 Ball 50% of the time it gives you crap....!,Ok I bought it because 2 of my Rechargable Energizer Batteries aren't holding all there charge. so I charged them for 5 minutes in my 15 minute charger to see if they were hold this said they were 100% which is wrong. so maybe I thought it was because they were hot ? 30 minutes latter after they cooled it still saids there 100%. but get this the good set in my Wiimote that saids 3 bars which is around 75%. but this thing saids 2 lights which is 40% I guess ? not to mention this thing probably cost 50 to mass produce. ? so $12 maybe pushing it it needs to be about $5 for what it can do. oh and Rayovac batteries don't test well either. I tried testing the ones in my tv remote that's been in there for 2 years. after my Wiimote drained them probably 90% and it just flashes every time and yes I switched it to primary....!
2,Trust me--you won't want to read three of these,"Because this series is so popular, I assumed I would want to read at least three of them. What a disappointment. Grafton spends more time describing weather and what the protagonist eats each day than she does on dialogue, and the endings are all thrown together too quickly, when a mere three pages before the reader didn't know enough to speculate on whodunit. I hate to disagree with America, but these alphabet books are no good."
5,great aussie rock,oh the memories...... chrissie amphlett's voice is like no other. i had forgotten how many great songs the diviyls had released.
3,Great book until the last couple of chapters.,"After reading several reviews of this book I could not wait to get it. I went out that very night and bought it. I was up until about 3 a.m. and then could not fall asleep right away because the book scared me so much. Then, the next day - I couldn't wait to get back to it. I was totally disappointed - what a let down. What happened to Adam Wyatt? The ghost was such a great part of the book and then poof! he was gone - no explanation and then the confusion of Ralph Cazaubon and Joanna. I guess I'll have to wait for the movie - maybe the movie will integrate more of the ghost and explain exactly what happend to Joanna."
1,Fuggadaboutit,"I always go to the worst reviews, and generally find them simply to be whining. In this case, I have to agree. I've spent hours with this and can't get an image up. Extremely disappointing; sending it back tomorrow and buying a SONY, which I hope will fare better."
2,Broken Toggle Button,"The toggle button on the back, which is required to navigate the menu items, did not work - it only went in two directions. Therefore, the frame was unusable. I had to return the item. The picture quality seemed okay, but no better than a Kodak frame I bought a few weeks ago. I would not recommend this frame until they make it easier to use and navigate."
1,The worst customer service,"I bought this product 2 months ago. After some days of using it, a vertical green line appeared on the screen. At that time, I did not know that I could return it to Amazon, so I contacted Phillips Customer Center for assistance. A Phillips representative told me to send the defective photo frame to Phillips Consumer Repair and Exchange.After a few weeks, I got the photo frame back, but the problem was worst than before. More than half of the screen was blank, and the line was still there. I called Phillips Customer Center again and asked the representative how a defective product can be send back to a customer. He said that it might have been damaged with the shipping. I believe that Phillips just sent back to me the same defective device.Now I have to ship it again to Phillips for a replacement. Nevertheless, I live outside of the US, and the shipping fee is expensive. My advice: don't buy this product!!!"
1,"Problems, problems, problems","I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law. Since she is elderly and not very tech savvy, I opened it so I could load photos on it before giftwrapping. The connection to my PC didn't work. I tried with my laptop - same problem. After several calls to Philips (they need better trained people in the customer service department), they sent me a new USB cable. Still had the same problem. So I requested a replacement unit. TWO MONTHS LATER, it arrives (I won't go through all the phone calls trying to find out when it would be shipped with no satisfaction). The connection to the PC worked for the photo frame but not for the SD memory card. And the battery is bad - only lasts 15 minutes instead of the 8 hours advertised. At least the battery worked on the original frame. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. Unfortunately, Philips sells substandard products and doesn't care about customer loyalty. Too bad - the concept was good."
3,"Nice picture, horrible software and manual","Bought this as a birthday present for someone not to tech savvy. I'm glad I decided to pre-load the frame with photos and the manual that comes with it is not very descriptive. The basic concepts (an ""album"" versus a ""slideshow"") aren't defined. You really have to wing it to figure out how to get the memory card loaded.The software that comes with it is terrible. It would transfer 20-30 photos then lock up. I had to press the reset button on the frame, disconnect the usb and restart it. I tried this on several different computers with the same result. For the price of the frame, there's no excuse for such poor software.Having said that, once I wasted many hours attempting to load it, the final result was nice.I wouldn't recommend this to someone who's not very technical."
5,2nd time is a charm,"The four-way control button worked erratically on the first one I received. I called Philips, and they sent me a new unit immediately - allowing me to return the original one after I received the new one (with a credit card in case I did not return the old one). The new unit works perfectly.The features are excellent - we love its ability to automatically turn on and off at specific times. The picture brightness and viewing angles are great.I recently had a chance to work with another brand of digital picture frame, and in comparison, the Philips controls and options are MUCH better. So, I highly recommend this product - both for its features and for the support Philips offers to products under warranty."
1,Case size - Lowepro Ridge 10,"This case (Lowepro Ridge 10)was suggested as an ""Add"" for my purchase of the Canon SX230HS. However, I quickly found the case is not big enough for this camera. The suggestion was incorrect."
3,Meh,"I am sure it is a great case, but I am giving it 3 stars because I thought it was bigger. It's not."
3,Too small for my Sony DSC-HX5V,"Unfortunately my camera was too big for this camera case. Anyway, it looks nice! But I cannot use itLowepro Ridge 10 Camera Case (Red)"
3,Wrong Size,"Buyer be aware: The Amazon website information is incorrect. It indicates the dimension of this case is 3.1 x 1.6 x 4.9 inch. My camera's size is 2.25 x 1.3 x 4.1 inch so I thought it will fit nicely. However, when I received the case, I cannot fit my camera in. After measuring the case carefully, I found the exterior length is only 4.3 inch. I am not sure about the size of the other two colors but this black case is just useless for me. The product quality and packaging is pretty good although I personally believe the regular price of 10.99 is kind of exaggerate."
4,A little too compact !!,"Bought this case for my Canon 300HS.Pros- 1. very compact, stylish case.2. Very durable outer material, internal soft material & padding.3. Belt loop is real nice and tightCons- Smaller than it appears in photo, fits the camera just right(inspite of mine being a small camera!). The front compartment is tiny and doesnt stretch much, barely fits the memory card case.Impression : Its as compact as your camera with a strong belt loop and shoulder strap. Has nice padding. But doesnt fit much more."
4,"Good bag, hard to get into when on belt.","This is a well-made camera bag and fits our camera well. However, due to the fact that it has a zip top, my husband does not like it because it is hard to get into when attached to his belt. He says he wants a velcro top so he doesn't have to fight it. I will use it for my camera instead."
2,You get what you pay for,"Well....took the sheets out of the bag and washed them right off the bat. Upon removing them from the washer (normal cycle) I spent the next thirty minutes cutting off unraveled threads. Not impressed. You certainly get what you pay for with these. As far as I'm concerned, I'd never buy them again."
2,Outdated,"This book is soooo outdated. I am a twelve-year old who has read this book, and tried some of the graphic-like things in the book. They do not work because the author has not tried to make a new edition of this book. Plus on top of that the quizes are horrible. You know the only right answer is right only because it looks like C, not becuase you know the answer. Also this book does not cover that much. let me change that, this book covers as much as adding 1 + 1. No wonder they need two volumes just to make this book worth selling. Take my advice, and buy another book that actually gives you the knowledge to program, and is not outdated."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I am very disapointed at this product, put it on took to the range to sight in and as long as you dont mind the sights being way way way off then go for it. I couldnt figure out why the product wouldnt work, i had a gun smith look at it and he sade that the problem was in the front sight which is not adjustable. Hense a WASTE OF MONEY!"
2,For Entertainment Value--But Not Serious Study,"This is beautiful software of a video game quality with all the bells and whistles. But that's where it stops. While it is, however, not a game, it cannot really be considered software for serious study and research. It is a view only package dissallowing interconnective use with other programs (like word processors, etc.) But for purposes of personal entertainment and Bible Study on the P.C. it is a good product."
1,Completely Inspirationless Cold Mahler,"As usual, Simon Rattle ticks all boxes. All meticulously done and calcurated, and manages to kill great spirit of Mahler's music as happened to most of Rattle's Mahler recordings. Where is warmth of humanity, violent primeval force, and spiritual depth so essential to Mahler symphonies? This is a prime example that most of conductors today can not match greatness of the music."
2,Disappointing,"I found this disappointing, particularly in view of other reviews. I found the plot weak and the characterizations very shallow. I honestly expected more. Penny Duff, Brandon, FL"
5,Meh.,"I had to buy this for an art class. It came across as whiny and one sided but if you like female artists who like other female artists and hate men, then this is good. The history and writing is fine, it just comes across biased."
4,Seems to work fine,"This battery seems to work as advertised. After a recent vacation trip, I returned home without my Kodak DX6490's charging dock, power adapter, and spare battery, so this was a replacement for the spare battery. When I received this new battery, I realized that it has a lower power capacity (1050mAh) than the battery that came with this camera (1700mAh), and thus has a thinner profile, but the camera accepts it just fine. If I had checked my camera's existing battery beforehand, I probably would have looked for one with the same power rating, but 1050mAh is probably sufficient for my purposes."
1,"BOGUS information on automobile repairs, purchases, etc.","Worthless information written by someone who thinks he is an expert. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone, unless they want to throw their money away. It is quite obvious that this book is written by someone with the typical ""used car salesman"" mentality. His ""insight"" to the world of automobiles is totally out of this world. Most of what is written is just plain WRONG, especially the parts of getting out of traffic tickets and representing yourself in Court. Advice like this can COST you thousands of dollars! I could not find one article in this book that would save anyone any money, except the author."
4,Good but not the best.......,"I like the book, but it didn't have as much action as the #2, #3, and #4. Kristy and Claudia have a new English teacher named Ted while their old english teacher is out on materity leave. Things get off to a great start! Sadly though, when Ted hands out a list of books for recomedation, some parents aren't happy.If you want to read about the cons of book banning, then this is for you. I can't wait for #6!"
4,Not that bad.,"This book was okay, but not the best. I mean, can all you talk about is a English project and an English teacher about to get fired by a whole group of parents who protest about the book reviews that the English teacher, Ted, hands out? I mean, what about Stacey and Jeremy, or Stacey and Claudia, or Claudia and Jeremy, or Mary Anne and Logan? They're important characters too! I can't wait until #6, Stacey and the Boyfriend Trap!"
3,Good so far,"Hello,So, I decided to purchase this product after reading the reviews. I'm generally pretty skeptical about some products when the reviews are generally too glowing, but I figured that I'd try this. I could always give my own objective negative review if it hasn't met the hype. I'm posting a 3* review to keep things real. Will upgrade if I notice that it starts to match the hype of other reviews. So far, no problems. I don't notice the smell that some have mentioned. I don't find it greasy. It applies and absorbs well. No complaints at all. I generally apply at night. I've noticed softer/smoother skin. Haven't noticed any improvement in terms of erasing/minimizing creases in my forehead or other areas. Just started using about a week ago though, around 4/15/12. I will update this review in time."
1,Parabens are in this product!,Why do they say it has no parabens when methylparabens are listed in the ingredients! That seems like false advertising to me!
4,"Overpriced, but good","I like this product a lot, and would purchase it again if it was cheaper. But I feel that it is overpriced by comparison to other lotions."
2,bad glue?,"The book came quickly but the binding is not good so the glue holding the first 20 or so pages has let go. The more I open it, the more pages fall out..."
5,"Good stuff, works like a Charm","I bought some leather luster for my black boots, being that I'm one of those Air Force guys who will wear my originally issued starched to hell and back BDU's to the very end! I never used leather luster before but this pack comes with everything you need. I simply followed the instructions to the letter and within 2 days, I have a pair of black boots that I will never have to shine again!"
1,Chabuca Granda,"Very displeased with this CD! I expected to hear Chabuca and it is others doing her best known works. Andk, in my opinion, they do a very poor job!"
3,Good,"Good, and full of useful info. A bit heavy on trying to convince the reader that they are not quacks, as the core of the book is based on much older work of author - yeast/candida overgrowth being a much more controversial subject in his day. Some legit info here, but please don't stop with only ""yeast"", explore all health possibilities. As not everything is caused by yeast, nor is yeast always the only problem or its removal the complete cure in every case."
2,complicated book,Hard to read. It only has a couple of different designs for treehouses. This is for an experienced builder.
5,One of the best books on this topic,A very good book to take a look at. Quite professional and quite easy to read.
2,"Sloppy ""scholarship""","You know a book is bad when authors can't even get some obvious, basic facts correct. Regarding my website, ""Evidence for God from Science,"" Hurd states in the appendix, ""These web pages, hosted by God and Science.org, illustrate the intelligent-design support among young earth creationists."" The problem is that God and Science.org is presented from a decidedly old earth perspective. In fact, young earth creationism is specifically denounced on numerous pages - two pages of which even call it heresey. The fact that Hurd missed this obvious fact (check out the website yourself) demonstrates his shoddy, sloppy scholarship."
1,Look elsewhere,"This book makes the mistake that many scientists have made through the history of science. Current scientific ideas are not set in stone, and our knowledge of subjects can change over time. Not a helpful book as it's arguements are flawed.Science cannot prove or disprove God. God is out of the scope of science because there is no test that can disprove the existence of God. Science is what we observe, not how it got there or observing forces beyond what we can measure."
3,Responsive Service / So So Product,"Good and quick service. One of the plastic stake polls cracked on initial assembly, I called them and the fellow was very kind. He got a replacement and immediately shipped it to me. Unfortunately, the product's performance is mediocre. The lighting is dim but readable at night. The charge does not last all night. It really needs a lot of direct sun light. It's operation is inconsistant. Sometimes it lights and sometimes not, may be a loose connection."
2,Arrived damaged,"The shipping carton arrived undamaged but the product packaging was damaged suggesting supplier is sending damaged goods. The product was lightly damaged (exterior had small crack and was chipped, interior reflective liner dislodged, front bezel loose and slighlty warped) and needed some repair. The front light panel is not weathertight and may require periodic removal and cleaning of the interior chamber reflective materials. Mounting legs are in two parts, a tapered stake and an extension-must use extension raising the sign several inches above ground or go without both and set on ground. Otherwise seems to operate correctly."
2,Cheap but Basically OK. Overclaimed features,"1) Forget about 22 Mbps. I purchased 2 AirPlus 650+ PCMCIA NICs and a 614+ wireless router. Works fine at 11MBPS but even at 1 foot from the router will not achieve 22 Mbps.2) Interference with Cable TV, channels below 21 when the router is placed within 20 FEET of cable modem.. Limits flexability when configuring home network. Some channels are very bad no matter what router settings.3) Poor Technical support. Several EMAILs sent. Response within 24 hours. However, 75% of replies have no clue of the issue or how to resolve it. (Are they paid by number of replies?)4) Regurarly drops Nortel VPN connections. (Tech support clueless)-- This router provides basic connectivity, but leaves much to be desired. Will try another."
2,Reboot AGAIN????!!!!!!!,"I ended up having to go through 2 of these routers and ultimately returned both. The first one would never even connect and after calling tech support, was advised the router was bad so back it went to the store to be replaced by what looked like a ""updated version"". The second one actually installed seamlessly and I was up a surfing within minutes. Unfortunately, if I left my computer idle for more than 5 minutes, I would lose connectivity. Everything was fine if I continued to surf online non-stop (not very practical). After calling tech support again, they blamed ""interferance"" from my monitor or CPU. After moving it about 4 ft away from my puter, nothing changed as far as maintaining a connection. Two e-mails and another call to tech support had me trying to upgrade my firmware (I already had the latest version) and then blamed the wires to the router. I was sick of booting and rebooting so back it went to the store."
2,bad wireless router,well just to start the only reason that im starting to hate this router is that i keep loosing wireless connectivity.i have researched on the net and have found that im not the only person with this router that is having this problem.everything else on the router works.i have emailed dlink multiple times and have not received a reply fromt there technical support.i called there technical support and they walked me through all the DEFAULT configs... and i told them it wasnt the configuration its a defect with the routers wifi.im either hoping that they come out with a fix or im going to return it.
3,Having trouble with the TI chipset,"The Dlink router is good but not the wireless part. It use a 166 Mhz ARM 9 network processer which is state of art and can have a sustain throughput of 45mbps for the wired ethernet connetion. But only one bad, I mean real bad implementation. It uses a TI chipset could not hold on for three hours of continously transmittion at about 45% load. It means you need to reboot the router about every three hours if you are downloading all the time. It happen to all routers with TI chipset. such as USR and everyone is advertising that they can go 22mbps. If you use it as a wired router only which will be the best price and performance you can get."
1,Garbage,"This product works for a couple months and you ""think"" its the best thing since sliced bread... HOWEVER as the months go on, it starts having problems... such as rebooting itself at random times disconnecting you from the internet, and not allowing you to view certain web sites. Technical support is very slow and couldn't resolve my problem. After several WEEKS they issued an RMA and sent me a refurbished model with the same problems. So I wouldn't recommend this product, or any D-Link product if you want something that's going to last and work for more than a year."
4,Great product and easy to install!,"I used this unit with my Toshiba notebook that comes with built-in wireless card. Although it took me couple hours to configure it to work, it's great after it's working. I love the security filters where I can limit my own computers to connect to this D-link router. I only gave it a 4 stars because I found this unit for [less at a department store]."
2,works for a few minutes,"This router works fine until you use it for a few minutes...then it reverts to 1 or 2 MBPS, and you can't even use that, rendering the connection useless. This is while used with a dlink wireless card. Customer service claims that atmospheric conditions caused such slow speeds at a distance of 5 feet from the router with a clear line of site...they are a joke."
1,"Flaky, no support","Very flaky product. Router crashes often and you have to power cycle to reboot. Tech support is non-existent. The people at the 800 number gave me another number to call which is a toll call. After 20 minutes on hold with toll charges and no answer, I gave up. I tried email. Got an automatic mailing telling me they'll respond within 24 hours. 5 days later, still nothing. Save your money."
2,"Great, except for regular signal drops","I really wanted to like this router. It's packed with features, looks cool and was cheap (after rebates). The setup was painless and I was working fine after only a few minutes. All was great until the wireless connection started dropping at regular intervals.I work about 15 feet from the router (2 walls) and maintain a 95-100% signal. At least once an hour or so, the signal quickly falls to zero for a few seconds, then returns to normal. Unfortunately, I use a VPN link to my office and a signal drop of even a second kills my link. I then have to close my applications and log back on to the office. That's VERY annoying. I could accept some interference causing a drop once in a while, but at least once per hour, or more, is unacceptable.Too bad, I liked this router otherwise but I sent it back and will try Netgear."
5,Great router... Even bought one for mom!,"This has been a great router. I have had no problems with it whatsoever. One drawback is that even with the ""AirPlus"" reciever PC card, I haven't seen the promised 22mbps speed. You don't need 22mbps to surf the net though...Overall, a fantastic investment. I share my cable internet access with 3 roommates and even let the neighbor piggyback! Config settings are straightforward and easy to use. Bought one for my mom to use with her laptop... she has had no problems. I highly recommend this router!"
1,Cheap Price = Cheap Product,"I purchased this with a mail in rebate. At first I had a little difficulty setting it up, Tech support was semi helpful and did get me working. Then I had my laptop with a D-link dwl650(paid $ after rebate) and a d-link CF DC660 802.11b card for my ipaq and now both wireless connections drop their connection ever few minutes. If I leave the ipaq off the laptop connection is stable. I also have a problem with the DHCP refreshing from the 614 router and read that others had the same problem. I agree with others who sense that the 22mbs is BS and can't see any speed increase. The whole world of WiFi is GREAT and surfing the net while having a Jamba Juice at the local mall is fun. The dropped sessions and DHCP problems have me wishing I had paid the extra money and got a better router. You really do get what you pay for!"
1,Incompatibility Issues,"The router worked fine for a hard-line connection, but as soon as I tried to set up the wireless connection, I began having difficulties. I had a built-in Wi-Fi card in my Toshiba laptop, and the router didn't want to recognize this card. The instructions are non-existent when it comes to configuring the wireless portion of the ""wireless router,"" and the tech support people refused to help me because my Wi-Fi card was not D-Link as well. I am returning the router in the morning to buy something with better overall compatibility."
2,Tribute by unknown bands lacks,"I just picked this CD up and to be honest...I wish I didn't. What can I say except that this CD seriously lacks in everything. Most of the bands on this tribute are unknown bands from ""who-knows-where."" Its not that bands have to be ""big"" or ""well-known"" to be good, but rather that these bands sound like they should still be playing in the basement or in the garage. Out of the ""known"" bands on this CD, Psyco Drama is the only band that really stands out by pulling off an amazing new-rendition of ""Too Late To Fall In Love."" Its seems to me that Psyco Drama shouldn't have wasted their talents or time with a project like this. Maybe they owed someone a favor or something. Its too bad that their performance can't save the rest of this wantabe tribute."
3,Okay but not as good as I hoped,"This book is just okay. It tells a legend in a spare, distant tone. Good for mythology studies at some point but not a great book for small children."
3,This book provided an overall view of glutamine benefits,"If you are looking for a general book on glutamine this is your book. It did a good job of explaining the general benefits and processes of action of glutamine. However, I was looking for a little more depth on the chemistry and physiology behind glutamine. If this is what you are looking for do not buy this book. If you just want a general layman's description; I would recommend it."
2,came incomplete,"i bought ths december 6th from ens solutions. it came missing the collet nut,tried to fine one but no hope.waist my time to purchase this..ENS Solutions.????"
4,Black & Decker RTX-B 3 Speed Rotary Tool,"Very powerful tool at a fraction of the cost, name brand. It has 3 speeds and a convenient built in hanger at the bottom of the tool. All you need is to screw in a hook to easily hang up. It has bare-bone accessories, so recommend you buy accessories before it is delivered. You will not be disappointed with the quality. Hope this helps."
4,good,Great tool for the buck. I own some dremel tools and this b&d kicked it far. Worth to buy for any kind of project. Did I say it is cheap for a good tool.
4,Good tool for the price,"This tool is as good as the Dremel tool. It came with no accessories which was a disappointment. I dont know where to find the accessories by Black and decker although some Dremel accessories are interchangeable and I had to purchase some of those. Still, I cant complain about the price of it.I expect to get a lot of use from it."
1,Are you kidding?,"The advertisement says it comes with 5 accessories, and it shows 5 pictures of a person performing tasks with 5 different accessories. THE TOOL ONLY COMES WITH 5 SMALL SANDING WHEELS THAT ARE ALL THE SAME! NO CUTTER OR GRINDER! Now I have to got to Lowes and buy the accessories I really need. I am sure it is a fine tool but it is being falsely advertised."
3,Not sure how I feel about it yet,"I bought this dremel at Walmart on clearance for $25. I was so excited because I've been searching for a dremel at a reasonable price for months. The problem that I had with it was that the collet was stuck in the collet screw when I first opened it, and I didn't realize this until way later. Also, one of the accessories didn't fit, so I had to wrap a thin gauge wire around it so the collet would tighten. Other than this, it seems to work well. The speed adjustment is really nice and it is consistent. Can't wait to do more projects with it."
3,"works well, but was missing mandrel","Works well, the low-mid-high settings offer adequate variability. The only gripe is it was missing the mandrel so I can't use the included 5 sanding disks."
4,excellent quality for the price,this was exactly what I was looking for and it has lived up to it's advertising and specs! i would recommend it to anyone.
4,solid and just good.,"purchased this as well as the neiko kit at the same time to compare them, and while more or less expected, the rtx feels so much more solid and professional. it even feels better than brand-name dremels I had in the past.what's really great is compatibility with the dremel-brand 4486 keyless chuck (my thanks to many reviewers here who confirmed that) - super underrated option."
1,The review has been reset,"I have been watched this particular item for more than 6 months (daily checking my wish list) with the hope that its price will drop near to the minimum (10/17/2010):[...]So I saw several (not many) reviews with 1, 2, and 3 stars for months. But now it has 48 of 5 stars and a 4 stars. What's wrong with the Amazon review system? Are they cheating on us? How can we trust the system like this?"
4,A Fast Read,Not for the timid but an interesting suspense/romance novel. I enjoyed reading this novel and look forward to more by this author..
4,good flow,"Nice story, short, plot twist to a minimum, steamy without overdoing it, with enough charactor development to have you caring, but not bored."
1,Waste of time,"One of the worst books I have read. I was under the impression that I am going to read a detective novel, instead I read a poor effort of romance and no suspense. If 5% of the pages was devoted to the story line, it is a lot."
2,Better books on the subject !,"The book itself is average...though...some scripts were not working and/or only working with IE or NS.They advertize a link for downloadable scripts. Unfortunately, there are no scripts on their link.CONCLUSION: You can find better books than this one, dealing with the same subject !"
2,Doesn't work with Windows 98 First Edition,I ordered this card for a HP Omnibook Laptop running Windows 98 (First Edition). The documentation included with the DWL-650+ card and on the D-link website listed Windows 98 as a supported OS. The card didn't work and after investigation (D-link website DWL-650+ FAQ) I determined that the only version of Windows 98 that the DWL-650+ card works with is Windows 98 Second Edition. I am returning the DWL-650+ and ordering a DWL-650.
2,"cheap, but bad quality","We bought three of these cards and I cannot recommend them. The 22Mbps and 256-bit WEP encryption features cannot be used unless you have a special D-Link access point. But you can always use it as a classic 802.11b 11Mbps card.However, our cards often did not recover well when the laptop was reactivated from suspended mode. A firmware update from www.d-link.com, which adds the WPA security feature, didn't make things better. My laptop actually started to freeze every once in a while. To make things worse one of the cards broke down after a year only.I have been using Belkin Wireless 54Mbps Notebook Adapters since and they have proven to work very well. I recommend spending a few extra bucks to get a card of better quality."
2,I wouldn't do this again if someone gave it to me...,"I have made 2 separate attempts of trying D-Link's wireless cards and both times they failed miserably. This setup isn't worth the hassle. The connection is terrible, setup is a nightmare, and there are better products on the market ...Good luck to you with this piece o' mess."
4,"Works fine, if you can get past the initial frustrations.","I installed the software first (as directed), which appeared to be successful. However, no icons were installed on my desktop, and I couldn't find the config utility even when I searched my hard drive. The installation guide was useless - no mention of anything like this. Support on the website was only slightly better, but did manage to figure it out eventually:First I had to upgrade my BIOS (I've only had my Dell laptop for a month!), then I had to download updated drivers for the card (geez! they just shipped it last week!), then I downloaded the updated firmware for my DI-614+ router (this wasn't required, but I wanted to match the latest drivers for the PC card).Finally - voila! But what a pain!"
2,WARNING: Not Linux compatible,"This uses a TI chipset which TI refuses to release any information about to the Linux driver writers. Thus it is unlikely to ever be Linux compatible. It seems to work okay under Windows XP, but I try not to support jerks and you can get a much faster Wireless-G card for not much more nowdays, so it's definitely *not* recommended."
1,horrible product,"worked for about 1 month and began having defects. the service was horrible, and was not able to help at all. It shuts down the computer after using it for a few minutes. we returned it and got a new one which after a week started doign the same thing. The laptop, is new so i doubt it is the laptop's problem. if you buy the product, keep in mind that if a problem like this occurs, you're left in the dark."
5,A true master,"I have been fortunate enough to attend a seminar with Shudo Demei and his ease, technique and understanding of acupuncture blew me away. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who wishes to improve their abilities as an acupuncturist. Shudo Sensei fills the pages with alternative point locations, alternative uses for common points, case histories, and clinical experience. The information in these pages can be found no where else as Shudo Sensei himself has based the majority of this information off his many years of clinical experience. I must also thank Stephen Brown for his great work in translating this book. His translation skills are matched only by his skills as an acupuncturist."
3,Hard to Say,"Being a classically trained martial artisit, I found this book to be insightful and certainly worth the time, money and energy to read. The Major downfall to this book, that I have never found in a true classic on this Way of Life, was the repeated insistence on the superiority of this Way of Life over the others. Still, it is a good book, but one that should not be taken too seriously."
2,Stuck in the Past,"This book was far from enlightening. We have all heard the ""warrior"" banter for far to long but nobody wants to relate it to the 21st century... I could find the same lessons in a Conan comic book. Although well-researched, the kill or be killed rhetoric presents itself in a most mundane fashion."
5,THE BOOK for all martial artists.,If you're into flashy martial arts and all the other garbage you see on TV this book is not for you. This book is for the serious martial artist seeking to perfect himself or herself through the martial arts. I highly recommend this book.
4,It also worked for me!!,"After I read all the negative reviews, I still decided to give it a shot as it was my only alternative. The syncing works good but sometimes I am not able to sync because the Hotsync Manager ""gets hunged up"". In that case I have to remove the USB cable, exit Hotsync Manager, plug the cable again, and start Hotsync Manager again. Sometimes I will have to reboot my PC when this doesn't work. I guess Palm is working to solve this problem. In the meantime I have to keep doing all this stuff which is a hassle but still is no big deal... unless for me. It would have been more costly to buy another Palm Pilot, or another cradle with a USB connector."
2,works 10% of the time with an iMac,"It's ridiculously hard to make a connection. I thought I'd gotten a faulty adapter, but when Palm FINALLY sent a replacement it didn't work any better. I've tried it in every USB port and with different cradles. All the nifty things you can get by hot-syncing -- you know, Avantgo, vindigo, etc. -- become so frustrating they're not worth it."
2,Unreliable with OS X.,"I moved from a PC to a Mac running OS X. I'm now running the Palm Desktop 4.0 beta with 10.1.3 using the Palmconnect USB adaptor. I needed to edit my original review because I carelessly assumed that everything was fine after the first successful hotsync. I actually have the same problems as others. It rarely works. After doing a re-install I was able to get it to hotsync again, but not two days later when I tried once more. Frustrating. Perhaps it's the beta Desktop software from Palm running on the newer Mac OS X, but others reported problems with different operating systems so I'm not sure."
3,Works fine - - most of the time,"Seems to need to be plugged and unplugged periodically, but is otherwise fine."
1,PALM USB,The product does not function with Windows XP. Tried the connector with a Palm V and a laptop running XP. The palm device does not sync and when disconnected from the laptop the XP operating system crashes. You will find similar comments in other reviews. Went through the routine of downloading new drivers from Palm site. No help!The palm support site is of little use in correcting the problem. This product should be avoided unless you are looking to kill a few frustrating hours.
2,PS: On second thought,"I recently rated this item a ""3"" because, although it seemed to require fiddling with to get it to work, it was not that much of a pain. Well, it has now stopped hot-synching altogether. I guess the other reviews are correct: it is fairly unreliable. I especially fault Palm for making some of their products (like my M-100) available only with serial plugs, forcing you to buy an ""accessory"" like this, then not making sure it is reliable."
1,Forget mac OS X,I wrote a review for this a week ago and now all reviews have dissappeared from the product page.... interesting. I reiterate: This Item does not work reliably with OS X. Beware!
2,USB Kit,"mmmm, it does not working perfecttly every time, when i sync mi info sometimes i have to reset my computer. I dont know if is because i have Windows Me."
4,Well worth it!,"While many people complain of the high cost, they might not take into consideration exactly what the USB Connection Kit is doing. To take a serial connection and to convert it to a usb compatible signal is no easy feat. For what it does, I think that the USB Connection Kit is a great deal."
2,Doesn't work well with Macs,"I was disappointed with this product. I purchased the PalmConnect USB Kit to sync with my PowerMac G4 running Mac OS 9.2. My Mac won't startup while the PalmConnect USB Kit is connected. It works okay if I disconnect it, startup the Mac, and then reconnect, but this is irritating. For the price and from a company like Palm, I expected much better."
5,Perfect for large tea bags,"This box is beautiful, and designed specifically for tea bags from Two Leaves and a Bud, which are larger than normal because they are for brewing a ""mug"" of tea rather than a ""cup"" and because they put whole loose-leaf tea leaves into their tea bags instead of tea ""powder"" like other brands. I'm happy I got a chance to buy this box on Amazon, because the Two Leaves site is no longer offering the empty box for sale - you have to buy a more expensive set already filled with tea flavors that you might not necessarily want. I recommend this box."
4,mandatory add-on,"I was using the macro part of the wide angle/macro lens for my macro shots, and I while I like being able to get that close, I didn't want to always have to. So, I got this little kit. The +4 does very nice for shortening up your focal length, with the +10 really taking you into macro territory. Obviously the two stacked brings you back within 2-3"" of your subject. I don't need to applaud how this can help expand your creative horizons, because if you're checking this out you already know :) My only qualm, which seems to be common, is the build quality. The threading can be a bit challenging, and even the lettering seems a bit...eh. Also, compared the the rather hefty +14 attachment that I was used to, these two are almost too light. Even stacked they're lighter...they just lack a more solid metal body."
3,Soundblaster Live conflict,"As a previous reviewer wrote, incompatible with Sounblaster Live cards due to a conflict with the Memory IO C000-C01F being used used by both cards. Disable one or the other and your fine, both will cause a BSOD(Blue Screen of Death)."
2,Compatibility problems,"Bought both the PCI card as well as the 650+ PCMCIA for my laptop. PCMCIA card installed reasonably well, though not perfectly smoothly but the PCI card was the installation from hell!I have an MSI K7T Turbo motherboard and it seems they don't like each other. The computer froze most of the time during boot up. After hours of fiddling and removing all other cards it still wouldn't work. Not only that but the card essentially destroyed the onboard RAID Bios. I tried two different cards (returned one to Dlink thinking it was faulty). Being unable to get a Flash for my M/Board RAID Bios I now need a new M/Board!So I am chucking the PCI Card and am looking at a different brand once I can afford it.Backup in Australia by DLink was pretty terrible. Waited an hour on hold the first time. Asked me whether I had a SB card (which I don't) and then said he didn't know what the problem was."
1,Something is wrong here,"You boot the computer, and everything is fine, but as time goes by, like an hour, the computer gets slower and slower and slower to the point where you can hardly move the mouse. Kill the airplus driver and the computer is alive again. Technical support makes you wait on hold on a toll number. Waited 20 minutes, no answer. Product is fine as long as you don't mind rebooting the computer several times a day."
2,For all of you looking in to Wireless Networking...,"I looking into it, and after seeing the great reviews for this product, I decided to buy it. I put it in our older computer, and it finally connected after about 2 phone calls to technical support, and an upgrade to the drivers. But then, my fast dsl internet was going slower than dial up when using the card. After many more calls to technical support, and stuff they told me to do which i did, the card still did not make my internet or network file sharing fast. it was not the phones or anything like either. I decided to switch the card to another pc, which i didnt really want being in there, but now it works fine! I dont reccomend this product, because it may not work on your pc like it didnt for one of mine, but i was lucky to have it working later on a different pc AT ALL. look elsewhere if you plan to go wireless, such as Linksys, whos routers and cards have never failed me."
2,Meh,Got this being a Kerouac fan. Very disappointing. Tries to be a Kerouac type tale but fails. You can see the plot twist coming from miles away and it is a poor one at that.
1,Very stale,"My daughter received this item as a gift. The Junior Mints are her favorite, so she opened those first...the chocolate was mottled and spotted white. We threw them out, hoping it was just that product. All of the hard candy seemed fine, but all of the candy with chocolate was inedible...very old, stale and obviously not properly stored."
3,Libertarian point of view......,"The book was alright but, not great. I've read each book in this series and I wasn't as impressed with this one as the others. Maybe this was due to the fact that one of the characters was described as having Libertarian ideas then further described as a neo-nazi, hate mongering nut. I've been a card carrying Libertarian for years now and I can say unequivocally that I'm not even remotely like that nor have I ever met a fellow Libertarian who was anywhere near that horrible description of us. That description bothered me through out the book... If she wanted to truly know what Libertarians are like all she had to do was look at our party stances on major issues. Hopefully the next book will be more interesting. I doubt many of you will find this helpful but, I had to get it off my chest."
5,The Forgotten by Faye Kellerman,"The Rina Lazarus/Peter Decker novels by Faye Kellerman are outstanding. I didn't know much aboutthe Jewish faith or their customs and it has been very enlightning. If you read these books, youshould start at the first book which is Ritual Bath. There about 19 of these books so far andthey could be read out of sequence but it would be much better to go from the oldest to thenewest because they do emcompass their lives and sometimes an old nemisis may be brought backor things that have happened in prior books. Kinda like reading Patricia Cornwall."
3,Too bizarre to be believed,"I'm a big fan of this series, but the coincidences we are expected to swallow in the book are just too much. First of all, we're expected to buy that the very first and only hate group that Decker investigates after the synagogue trashing is the one involved with the crime and subsequent murders - and the first prep school he goes to after the crime turns out to yield the perpetrator. Then the kid who does the crime ends up magically going to the therapist who ends up being linked to this hate group, etc. etc. etc. And Decker's step son magically knows all of these people. Wait a second, is this a small town? I thought it was Los Angeles! You expect some coincidences in mystery novels but this is just too much. It's not a well-crafted novel, and although the familial relationships are still quite interesting and endearing (although Decker's love/distrust relationship with stepson is a bit overdone)... I think you can do better, Ms. Kellerman..."
3,Charming,"It's a charming old movie, but the quality of the dvd is very poor. The video is out of focus and sometimes the audio is a bit garbled."
5,Just terrific! Should be on the best seller's list!,"I was so happy to see this come out. I've known the author for many years and can vouch for his credibility. He had dedicated his life to the research of such pursuits, has had many encounters and is as authentic as they come. I find it interesting that the one critic who wrote in didn't bother to reveal himself by name...hmmm...if you want to debate, do it intelligently and don't hide! Peter is the real deal and is a real out-of-the-box-thinker!Kudos to him and his book! :0)"
5,What makes us America,"I begin this series every year around the beginning of July to remind myself all the trials and tribulations the United States has been through. Although I was disappointed with Ken Burns World War Two series ""The War"" it is his magnum opus the Civil War that is probably the greatest historical documentary ever produced, And at the price listed here it is a steal. If you are undecided about buying it, just think of it as a cultural investment. I first watched this in High School and have watched it once a year since the 90s. So buy it and get introduced to Shelby Foote and the rest of the civil war historians gathered together for one final time. See Ken Burns ""Baseball"" for lighter, yet just as educational fare. Also. ken burns documentary Prohibition coming this fall"
5,Exellent product,I am pleased with the whole experience. I have always liked this series but I never before found it so reasonably priced. I got the DVDs and software (Amazon unbox) to watch the series on my computer.
5,Ken Burns.... The Civil War,"I don't think anyone could not agree that this is a wonderful and eye-opening documentary of the Civil War. CW buffs and historians alike can watch this for hours and feel humbled. What it must have been to have gone through such an event, both from a politicians view, slaves and slave owners, families of soldiers, and the soldiers themselves that fought in the bloodiest war ever."
5,amazing,"The finest documentary I have ever watched, and one that I want to own so I can experience it again and again"
1,Don't trust the sender!,The documentary is fabulous - BUT I got sent an unwatchable product by the Shoppes - and NO response to my complaint. Bum deal.
5,As good as it gets.,This is another great documentary accredited to Ken Burns. Nicely done and extremely informative. I purchased this for my wife who loves it and has watched it several times over.
3,unsure - given for a gift,unsure - bought for a Christmas gift. The speed with which it arrived is wonderful. I am sure my friend will like it.
5,Excellent! Now affordable.,The DVD version of Ken Burns' saga is finally affordable. It was $299.99 when the DVD version first appeared. Great educational resource.
3,"Content aside, what's up with the jumpy DVD picture?","I'm only part way through the first disc and enjoying it except for one very annoying aspect... the picture jumps on the screen. Does the VHS version do this? A friend of mine also bought the DVDs and complains of this too, so it's not just my system. I expect more from a DVD version."
4,Civil War (DVD) by Ken Burns,"As a Canadian who has visited Gettysburg, and possesses a Union Army sabre dated 1861, I was eager to learn more about the Civil War. Upon getting this set and watching it several times, I can say without reservation that this is truley the best documentary that I have ever seen. Every time that I watch, I learn something new. Also, the commentary by Shelby Foote contained in the movie are both informative and easy to listen to. His resonant voice, and easy drawl, make his insight a joy to listen to"
5,A piece of American History that everyone should experience,"A time-capsule of american History. Of of the best if not THE best interpretations of The war faught on American soil that no one can fortget. Great photography tecniques, and powerful narrations and interviews inhance this intiment portarit of one of the greatest times of history"
3,Read the manual before purchasing.,"The manual tells you what the datasheet doesn't tell you such as that the product does NOT work as anything other than an AP unless you use it with other D-Link products. The datasheet says it supports five modes with a warning that the repeating mode works only with some of their products. The truth is other modes like bridging or wireless client also require D-Link products on the other end. Basically, this product cannot behave like a standard 802.11b client device. The execuse they use in the manual is wireless client is not a part of 801.11b standard, which does not make sense to me because then what on earth their 802.11b NIC implements.If you are looking for a cheap ethernet-to-wireless bridge, rethink before buying this one.I give it three stars because it does a fine job as an AP."
5,Great for Expanding your Network to Wireless,"I have this plugged into my DI-604 (DSL router/firewall with 4-ports) to enable wireless capabilities on my network. I have a wireless card in my laptop and I get great range from this AP. I can roam all around my apartment and even one room in my neighbors place. Fortunately though I can filter out all other MAC addresses besides the ones on my LAN so that no body else can join my LAN without my permission. Not to mention 256-bit WEP encryption.I get an average of 5Mbps speeds when transferring files, which obviously doesn't affect my Internet browsing at all.I am very pleased with the performance, security features, and price. I'd recommend this to everyone who is looking for a fast, secure, and reliable access point."
2,"Looks cool, but has a lot of problems.","First off, I want to say that setting this thing up isn't that difficult. However, it is mind-numbingly tedious and can be absolutely maddening when you are trying to configure it work with your existing network and end up having to reset it due to making a mistake. Where I ran into problems was after it was setup. My wireless enabled computers where getting kicked off the wireless network on a consistent basis whenever I was trying to download anything large. One example of this is Windows Update... I finally had to resort to plugging an Ethernet cable into my computers in order to finish them. In my opinion, the performance of this adapter is simply unacceptable."
2,"2 & 1/2 stars; pleasant, but uninspired","It's not that this is a BAD book, it's just ordinary. It does, however, have some nice moments and interesting characters. As the other reviewer noted, the huge surprise was not treated as a significant event, but I found nothing wrong with the ending otherwise.There were awkward moments and subplots not fully explained or left to dangle, but overall it was a fairly pleasant read -- especially at a season when so few books are worth cracking open."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"The physics portion wasn't very good, I thought the Powsner physics book was a lot easier to understand. It isn't very readable, and goes on and on like a poorly written review article with paragraph after paragraph of summaries of clinical trials but lacking in synthesis and putting everything together. Definitely not in the same league as Harrisons or Braunwald."
2,Disappointed,"The watch worked well for about 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, the audio part of the watch continues to work well, but the hands gain 5-10 minutes a day! I bought the watch for my father who is visually impaired. The voice is clear and easily understood. We love that part. And we were very happy with the black hands on the simple white face which allow him, in good light, to see the time. But with the hands not working properly, and he's not able to see to constantly re-set the watch, he has to depend solely on the audio. Very disappointed."
5,awesome,"a masterpiece from the paintings and illustrations to all the history,training and HUNTING with raptors.this book is sure to be a collectors item ."
5,White to Black Belt,"I am a purple belt,I love Saulo's dvd's this set covers even more of the great Ribeiro BJJ that revolution 1 does.My training partners from white to black are all enjoying it as well, my instructor began teaching the x pass, he too loves saulo's theorys and technic.The pass works well and is easy for just about anyone to learn and use, thats Saulo's BJJ, no gimmics or muscle, just pure BJJ...works for white belts, young and old as well as the hardcore advanced folks as well.just the x pass alone is worth the cost of the dvd set, not mention the running escape which is covered in his Book, but the dvd really makes it clear how the escape works,, I have been studying the dvds everyday, they will help get me too brown belt and beyond.BJJ is alot fun and Saulo brings even more joy to trainingThank You Saulo, you are a great teacher and human being, thank you sharing your knowledge with the worldI hope to meet you one day!"
2,Comes apart too easy,We bought this toy for my 3 year old for Christmas. He loved it at first but then the front loader kept falling off every time he tried to dump it himself. It works fine if you use the controls but don't try to be creative on your own. We finally had to put our own screw in the back to keep it together.Would not recommend this toy
1,Pay a little more for better quality,"The first time out of the box, the button that holds the trigger in the on position would not depress. When I pressed a little harder, it broke off. The chuck did not feel very substantial. Otherwise, the feel of the trigger/motor action seemed to suggest better quality."
4,Decent knife,I bought this knife on reputation alone. It's solid and relativly light weight with a thicker blade. My one beef is that the handle seems a bit cheap. I should have upgraded to the aluminum handle : .
3,A little too tough,"This is a solid knife. Fairly heavy and more than capable of meeting your cutting demands. But it is also bulky, and here is the worst part for me...the assisted opening mechanism requires not only practice, but often a fair amount of thumb pressure to deploy. Sometimes it's easy, other times, it hangs up. My right thumb developed a tender bruise after an hour of testing it. If you are just going to open the knife when you need to cut something, fine. But if you like to play with your knife (c'mon, that's why you are buying it right?), forget about it. My right thumb is shot for a week until it heals properly. Thats why I am returning the flash II. By the way, I have other knives I open with one hand, including a Spyderco rescue type knife and a Buck Redpoint, which have never given me any trouble."
3,SOG Flash II,"I received this item today and I'm pleasantly surprised how sharp it came. This knife was bought for EDC, but I have real concerns about the stability and strength of the handle. It is very light-weight and if held on its side with the blade open you can see light very easily through the handle where the two pieces of the handle meet (suspect). It was only $35 and so don't expect much I guess. The spring-assisted opening mechanism does work smoothly."
5,excellent illustrations and descriptions,"Like all the Dover coloring books, this one is an excellent educational tool as well as a fun coloring book. One thing that other reviewers have not noted is that many of the illustrations feature young male dancers. In fact, the dancers illustrated are of different ages and ethnicities as well which is nice to see."
2,Inspect towel before you use it!,"The towel is nice, soft and thick, but the hem is coming apart. Unfortunately, I didn't notice this flaw until I washed the towel. (I always wash towels before using.) I never used the towel, only washed it. A second towel I ordered is fine, so it may not happen often, but look carefully after you get the towel for flaws."
4,The first of a fantastic series by Jackson & Livingstone!,"This is the first book of a great series known as Fighting fantasy. Steve Jackson & Ian Livingstone made a fortune out of this original Idea, and so it is not surprising. It is first class, well produced literature. Continuously entertaining, and thoroughly enjoyable for all ages. It Is a shame to see the series cut its production line, but after writing 59 different books In the series, It's no wonder the craze had to end somewhere. Young males of this era have missed out on good literature."
5,THIS WORKS PERFECT,it is what we needed. we replace this unit yearly. it came fast and undamaged we will order again next year
4,Much better than his first novel,"The author loves throwing in pop culture junk, celebraties, and circuit boys. Through it all, he has managed to write a touching romance novel, with real fleshed out flawed characters facing everything we hate to deal with in real life. I reveled in the banter, was tittlated by the romance, and genuinely felt for the hero of the story, an every(gay)man type working in a job he hates trying to become a successful writer. It feels very fairy talish until we are faced with a real morning after.Buy it. Read it. Love it.P.S. Much better than his first novel."
4,Sexy with a Capital S,"If you enjoy a novel that offers you lazy giggles, splendid human encounters, ton of dialogue, undeniable sexual situations, quick page turning drama, sassy humor, soap opera scenerios, and gorgeous individuals, this is the book for you. I recommend this as a summer at the pool read. I love this author!"
4,Bruder cement truck,"My 3 1/2 yr old grandson was ecstatic when he opened this toy for Christmas! The toy is very durable although it is plastic. I had read a review by another person who suggested using beans instead of sand and this was a great idea!! The workings of the truck are very realistic as you roll the drum counter clockwise to mix and clockwise to pour out the ""concrete""."
1,Expensive piece of plastic,"The all plastic and decal construction of this cement mixer was a big disappointment right out of the box. The shoddy quality and extremely low durability leave a lot to be desired in a child's toy. Bruder, the manufacturer, claims to be a German maker of ""high quality"" toys for over 90 years. This makes me think Mercedes and BMW but clearly I am mistaken. Today the cement mixed lies broken in several pieces. Mind you, this is not due to abuse - it's more a testament to the fact that this toy was never meant to actually be played with.Is it unreasonable to expect, for north of fifty bucks, to get a toy that has a little bit of craftmanship?My advice is to get Tonka - much higher quality at less than half the price!"
5,Perfect material for measuring spoons,"I love how these spoons are made. They are thick, so they don't break easily. I just wish that the spoon had a measurement of one-eighth tsp, but other than that they are great utensils. I will probably get the cups sometime soon. I received the spoons in a matter of days."
3,They work,"It's really hard to go wrong with measuring spoons, and what can I say, they work! In the positive, they're durable, dishwasher safe and clearly marked. On the negative, unless you unclip them from each other (the gray part) you can't use them. That gray clip keeps them held together so tightly that you can't rotate out the inner spoons without it popping open. Not a big deal, but a bit of a pain"
1,"If I could give it 0 stars, I would","Quite simply, Ralph Blum has no idea what he is talking about. Not only does he change the order of the Aetts, (the proper order of the Elder Futhark is set that way for a reason) instead rearranging them into five groups of five runes, his interpretations are meaningless, inaccurate, and just plain wrong. He seems to think that it's totally okay to just throw away all of the traditional information and interpretations of the runes and make up his own drivel about what they mean. I don't know what he thinks he is writing about, but it sure isn't about runes.I make it a point to steer people away from his books, as he is a wealth of misinformation."
2,No thank you.,"I thought the book looked like a quality read, and it was okay. But the quality of the runes made me downright angry. Holding them felt like my nails being scratched on a chalkboard. I do not recommend this set to anyone."
2,Book of Runes:,"Received the book quickly and in good shape. I was disappointed that the actual runes did not come with the book, as indicated in the title. Please be more specific if the complete set will not be included."
1,It's Garbage,"It's very appealing because it looks nice and comes with a set of (cheap) runes. But, despite his claims to the contrary, the author has little respect for runic tradition, having started by simply inventing a new order for them. It would be better to use a book based on reliable research. There are plenty of great rune books right here on Amazon."
1,Highly Disappointing,"This is a movie that is having an identity crisis and just can't decide what it wants to be....a movie about Amazonian women, silly romantic teenagers, martial arts or some kind of weird fantasy. They threw everything in this but the kitchen sink and it shows, what a mess. I could barely watch it until the end. The plot is silly and the acting definitely sub par. The only good part in it was the fight scene between Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen but it's not worth watching just for that. I hope that having Daniel Wu play a eunuch in this strange movie will not cloud my love for his acting ability and sex appeal in every other movie I see him in from now on...that was just WRONG. What were you thinking accepting this role Daniel? Just an all around waste of a movie. Save your time and money and watch something else."
5,it's perfect.,"I was hesitant to purchase a rug online but Amazon has never disappointed me. This rug can be found for double the price or more. It's easy to see why. It's high quality... very expensive. This was a steal. We were looking for a rug for our nursery. This fits PERFECTLY at the foot of the crib. We tucked it just slightly under the crib- and it fills the room with color and fun.It was fulfilled by Amazon but sold by MLC Distribution, Inc. which also had made me skeptical but the company itself was fantastic. They wrote me an email once the order was made (along with Amazon's confirmation), and once delivered they enclosed a note on how to contact them if we had any problems with the rug."
1,Downloading problems,"The camera is okay, and the pictures are okay, but I've had to return two of them because the USB/downloading feature from the camera stopped working. Customer support is bad - after 90 days they want to charge me [$$$]dallars to fix it - this is for labor (one year warranty covers just parts). There seems to be a problem with this feature - I wish I did my research beforehand - I would have never purchased this camera."
1,It was quite dissappointing for me...,"Well, I know that this will sound a little fishy to someone out there who can perfectly enjoy the great techology that this camera has to offer... but to me it [was dissapointing] to find out that the USB connection wouldn't hook up to my computer at all, which basically means that I could takes great pictures with my camera, but I could put them on my computer.Now I read that some other people had the same problem with their computers as well... probably because of the windows ME which I also have. So even though the camera seems to be one heck of a good piece of hardware, it just seems pointless if you cannot use it. So I see no other choice than to give it 1 star.If you have another edition of windows this camera is probably pretty cool.Anyway... I had to give it back... I will buy a Casio exilim sx-z3 instead."
2,unpredictable,"I have had this camera for two years...The battery life is EXTREMELY POOR....have two batteries and for a day out, it is not enough...many times the memory stick causes errors....lighting is tricky, sometimes pictures come out good, most time bad....lighting is always a problem....outdoors too much, indoors not enough...this is my second digital camera and have decided to go back to my old film based Minolta which had never dissapointed me...."
5,perry como and that voice,"MR. COMO WAS FROM THE BOYS WHO LEARNED ALL THEY KNEW FROM CROSBY RECORDS AND FILMS. COMO, MARTIN AND SINATRA. IF YOU CANT CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BE TAKEN AWAY BY THIS MANS VOICE YOU MUST BE DEAD. THIS CD IS ONE TO GET AND ITS A NICE INTRO TO PERRY VOICE AND STYLE. THIS MAN WAS A GREAT SINGER, TV LOVED HIM, HIS SPECIALS WERE THE BEST AND HE WAS A GOOD DECENT MAN FORGOING THE TRAPPINGS OF HOLLYWOOD.GET THIS AND ENJOY."
5,This book made my layover worthwhile!,"This book was positively AMAZING! I am a huge fan of Tolkien, and more recently Paolini, and this book definately deserves a place among them. I picked the book up on a whim while wasting time during my layover at O'Hare, and I siply couldn't put it down! The only thing you can possibly find to complain about is that Kelleher is a bit comma-happy, but that is a small price to pay for such an excellent novel! The characters are believable, the descriptions are great...if you are a fan of fantasy literature, this is a book you must have!!"
3,OK,"Somewhat disappointing. I didn't learn anything new from this book. Good introduction to vegan nutrition, but just as much can be learned online in a half hour."
2,Very clinical and dry,I have a degree in food science and even I found this book to be very dry and hard to read. It's more of a reference if you are trying to go vegan and need specific reference information on how much of the various nutrients you should have.
2,Is it REALLY a good idea?,"As fun and quirky as this is, perhaps a dog hair sweater isn't that great an idea. Imagine what you'll smell like if you get caught in the rain. You're lible to be tossed off public transportation because of the smell of wet dog.Maybe you could just knit a dog bed or a dog sweater instead? Seems like a more logical use of the hair."
2,Vague and general,"We were looking for scientific, comprehensive information about fertility and conception. We found this book to be vague and general, which is OK if you need some background on general infertility or fertility issues. If you want a much more specific ""how-to"" on identifying fertile days, knowledge of fertility signs, and how to make detailed charts that will be useful for you and your doctor, then we very strongly recommend Toni Weschler's ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"" instead."
1,Not Very Good for Those Trying to Conceive...,"This book read like a textbook...not very interesting or helpful. In fact, I read through it and was so unimpressed that I returned it the day after I received it!"
2,They Gave This Book the Wrong Title,"While this book has a lot of useful information and is very thorough on possible causes of infertility, it's title and cover are deceptive. This is a book written for couples experiencing infertility who are trying to figure out the cause. For someone who is simply ""Trying to Make a Baby,"" this is not the book for you. Also, I found the tone of this book really negative. Rather than coming away with a feeling of ""Yes, I can do this,"" I started worrying about all the possible things that could go wrong."
1,Baby slippers,When I first saw these slippers they looked so cute and soft. My first thought was that they appeared to be cushion soft for comfort. Well that is not so they are the flat's pair of slipper I could have purchased. No cushioning for my little ones feet totally flat. Not a good thing when you want comfort for your little one to run around in. Would not recommend them to anyone. Not worth the cost.
5,Fabulous instrumental rock.,"Two stratocasters, a bass, drums and percussion. PLANKTON !Very talented musicians from Sweden who have crafted an extremely creative and interesting CD.Very good rhythm section, wonderful bluesy heavy guitars reminding of Jimi Hendrix, Robin Trower and other psychedelic seventies sounds.All songs composed by Plankton except the extremely sexy performance of Dave Brubeck's 'Take Five'..Absolutely great find, highly recommended!Plankton are :Christian Neppenstrom - GuitarsEmil Fredholm - GuitarsTomas Thorberg - BassSebastian Sippola - DrumsLars Normalm - Percussion"
2,Very little meat to this book,"This book has very little meat to it - it is a skinny book with big print and it really qualifies more like an essay on the subject instead of a book. The information is very basic and simplistic and it completely misses the point on the more subtle complexities behind rootworking. The impression I get is the author just did a quick internet search and then gathered what she found in an essay and voila - book. It may be that she knows a lot on this subject, but her writting does not reflect it. Some of the spells here are more common knowledge and old wives tales than actual rootworking spells.All in all - this book is a waste of money. If you are looking for information on the subject just about any book out there on Hoodoo and Herbal magick is better than this book. Hell, if you do a google search on Rootworking, you will probably get more information than you would in this book."
5,We love it!,"I saw this advertised in a baby magazine and cut it out. When we were planning our trip to California and would be in two airports, I found the clipping. We ordered it and just used it in the Atlanta airport and LAX and it was WONDERFUL!!! It rolls very well and strapped on easily to our Eddie Bauer car seat. We kept it attached to the car seat and checked it plane side. It was great to be able to just put our daughter in the seat and strap her in and go. I highly recommend it to anyone! We didn't have to bring a stroller, which made for less things that we had to carry in the airport. Plus you don't have a baby moving around in your arms while you're carrying everything else. We also got a lot of comments on it."
2,Go Go Kidz Review,"My sister & I both bought this product. It is so not worth the $80 that it will cost you. It is way over priced for the materials it takes to make this ""Go Go Kids"" attachment for the car seat. Not all car seats can be attach neither, so be sure to make sure yours does. It was great for wheeling the kids through the airport, but then it went down hill from there. The asles on the air plane are to narrow, so it can not roll down the isle to your seat. We had to at that point carry our kids in thier car seats to the back of the plane. Not at all what we had expected. The wheels pop off with very little effort(even when secure), which makes this product not all that good niether. I might return this product once we get home from our first trip with this product."
3,Question about travelmate,"I am thinking about purchasing the travelmate for a trip to Europe this summer. The reviews are so mixed, that I am uncertain.The largest complaint is about going through security as it won't fix through the X ray machines and then going down the plane aisle. It seems like some airports will hand check it, while others insist it go through the X Ray machine. I guess it just depends what airport you go through. I am departming through Newark and the TSA agents aren't very kind, so I expect a hassle. But for the plane part, isn't it easier to detach the trolley before you enter the plane and put it in the overhead compartment once you get on the plane? Noone seems to do that in their reviews. Is it that hard to detach the car seat from the trolley?Any additional information would be appreciated. Thanks."
1,Waste of money,"I purchased this item when I was faced with traveling with my 91 year old grandmother (in a wheelchair) and my 8 month old son. I did not trust the airlines to check and safely handle my Britax carseat so I planned on gate checking it. I knew there was no chance I would be able to carry a carseat, push a stroller, and push a wheelchair, so I bought this. It was nothing but a hassle. The video go-go babyz has makes it seem like you can do it one handed. Not so with the Marathon carseat. Although it is compatible, I found I had to squat down, balance the travelmate (there is no wheel lock), lift the carseat up and balance the base on the two small wedges, and then somehow fish the strap through the back of the carseat without letting the carseat slip off the one inch deep wedges. Really a pain in the arse. We didn't even bother with it on the flight home."
2,Didn't last very long,"I had trouble with this product. It fell apart too easily and it was awkward to get it on the plane. It was worth a shot, but didn't work for me."
1,painful!,I bought this anticipating easy longhaul travel with several stopovers. What a piece of rubbish. We struggled from the second we got it out of the car at the airport to check in. The silly wheel pin that holds the wheel in place kept popping out and I ended up tying the seat to the handle with the straps because it just wouldn't stay in place.The handle is not particularly sturdy (considering the price!). All in all it was a royal pain in the ****! Every time you need to detach the seat you have to screw/unscrew it at the back. It takes FOREVER. ALl the while you've either got a queue behind you or you're the last one off the plane. As for doing it with a toddler in the seat - impossible!We checked it into left luggage at our first stopover and picked it up reluctantly on the way back. Arriving back at the airport the wheel pin on one side finally gave up the ghost and I ended up dragging the whole silly contraption to a luggage cart.Don't waste your money.
5,Great Great Great Product,The Go-Go is a great product! We loved it so much we bought two. We attach them to our Britax car seats and zoom through the airport with the kids seated comfortably. We've had so many parents comment and question about them each time we fly. I've even purchased one as a gift for a friend when she had a baby and she loves it too.
5,Great product,"We just used this for a trip to San Francisco. We only used the car seat once, but the Go-Go Babyz Kidz Travelmate made bringing it with us a cinch. Putting it on the car seat and taking it off is quite easy. Not sure what screws one of the reviewers is referring. Rolls great and you can put another bag in the car seat if your toddler is walking or getting carried. I agree that the handle seems a bit wobbly, but it held up just fine. We checked this (instead of gate checking) and left the whole car seat/Travelmate assembly together and it was waiting for us in one piece ready to go at baggage claim. At first I was like ""75 bucks for this little thing?"" after we got it, but now think its well worth it."
3,"Good, but.....",This was a good CD but not what I was looking for. The lessons on the CD fall more along a traditional line of Spanish (Castillian). I am from Arizona and I want to learn what is commonly spoken here. Otherwise the CD has great lessons for learnng Spanish.
2,No Use for carpentry,The book is just a bunch of pretty photographs. No how-to or what materials/how much to buy. Mainly for interior decorators.
3,"Heavy on gore, light on inspiration","Blood-soaked and action-packed, Off Season suffers from characters that unfortunately inspire only apathy. Halfway through the book, I found I couldn't differentiate between the characters, and soon after realized it didn't matter - the gore is the star of the show, the characters just fodder. If you're looking for relentless savagery, have a read; if you're looking for a story you'll care about...meh."
3,Off Season,"There is not much i can say i found i had trouble sleeping after i read Off Season, i did finish it thouugh in bits and pieces."
2,Amazing Book...If it weren't so Outdated,"Jack Ketchum is unquestionably my favorite horror writer of all time. From Girl Next Door to Peaceable Kingdom, his prose is perfectly constructed with sharp pacing and fear-inducing ideas. However, while this book was certainly all of those things, it suffers from having been published over ten years ago. If the story were to happen now, since the inception of wireless internet and cellular phones, it would end before it started. And because isolation is the key to most great horror, especially this one, something that can't happen nowadays ceases to be scary. However, I would hate to deter anyone from picking this up for a well-written book, it's just that most horror fans are looking to get scared and that won't happen here."
1,Do NOT get this stuff on your fingers.,"I tried using this stuff on my joints, the liquid just gushes out & drips down your hand. It caused intense itching that lasts for an hour or more without an application of liquid antihistamine spray. Worse to come is when you have to go to the bathroom; Doesn't matter if your fingers are dry or if you've washed this stuff off with soap; your junk is going to come in contact with this stuff when you wipe, through skin or toilet paper, & it's going to burn like hellfire for awhile."
3,ok but great for any die hard PT fan,"i was dissapointed to see it was a DVD-R. production seemed like a low budget home job with the editors first time using Final Cut Pro or something. anyway, the audio is EXCELLENT, the video is clear but obviously amature/pro videographers. at least the cameras (what 3 at most?) where on tripods, but shakey when panning. any PT fan will love this DVD though, anybody else might not. the band is killer! great song selection. next time Pat films a concert he should have me do it."
1,I DONT KNOW WHAT THE OTHER VIEWERS WERE WATCHING,"This movie had a story line but other than that the acting was horrible, the zombies werent even scary and the camera technique was horrible I wouldnt even pay 1 cent to watch this let alone for free. I am sorry i wasted 2 dollars on this..well I shouldnt even call it a movie looks more like home video.. do not waste your money or time...take it off amazon.."
5,The Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread,"Civilization III is probably the best 4x game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) ever created. And the complete version makes it even better. The learning curve is a bit steep. But the payoff is well worth it. A complete game also takes a while. But there is so much ""stuff"" in the game that it never gets boring. It also gives one an understanding of why empires rose and fell."
4,Classroom Project,"I purchased this game for a classroom assignment. My class is studying to be Elementary Education teachers, and we are experimenting with this game to see the value of entertainment in education. This game has several important lessons to learn about social studies in general, but the added benefit of enjoyment helps motivate the students toward learning much more than any assignment which would not involve fun."
3,Civ 3 Game,I bought this to replace my son's broken copy that he has had since it was released. He plays this for hours on end so to him it is a fantastic purchase. At the very least he was thrilled to get it and we had searched all over the city for a copy locally.
3,Only 3 stars,"I enjoy the game, but I was dismayed by the terms and conditions of the game, only allowing it to be installed on 1 computer. Unlike the original game that allowed you to install it on multiple systems."
1,I Didn't Like It.,"I thought it was poorly researched. I mean... people used SOS in sailing ships in the 19th century? WTF? SOS wasn't used until the 20th century! A race of silly bickering aliens manage to take down Sulu and the Excelsior? Double WTF! There are times I found the writing clumsy and amateurish. I don't know why the editor didn't do a better job checking this out.Star Trek is supposed to be exploring that's out there, not negotiating for hostages. It's such a waste of time. I can't believe this guy co-wrote one of my favorite Star Trek movies."
5,Handy dandy B&D,I would highly recommend this dustbuster. I bought it for an office environment and it seems to be working great. Haven't had it long yet but it appears to be of good quality.
5,Great Cordless DustBuster,Does everything as described.Best one I've ever bought!!!!B&D; finally got it right!!!!!
4,I would recommend it,"nothing fancy, just a good product. We use it mostly to pick up cat hair and vacuum around the kitty litter box, it does a good job. After one week, it wasn't sucking things up, and we thought it was faulty - but it turned out that we just needed to empty out the dust chamber - once we did that, it worked just great again."
5,Excellent hand-vac,"I have one of these hand vacs and also one by Hoover, and this one is far better. The extra 9.6V power means that it takes less time to clean up. It provides more suction so you only have to run it over the mess you are trying to clean up once or twice rather than many more times with a less powerful vac. Also it is really well thought out in terms of cleaning the crud out of the unit itself. You just pop the top off and pour the crud out, or occasionally dust off the filter. Much easier than the Hoover.I've found the that charge lasts plenty long to cleanup whatever you are cleaning up, but you'll have to recharge it in between uses. Don't envision using this for weeks or whatever on a single charge, it's not going to happen.I definitely recommend this vac. It is really well made and well conceived and very handy to have around the house."
1,Slats too wide and too close together,"I had to replace my old old rack as it was pretty gnarly and bought one of these, finally after a week I smashed itto bits. The slats are wider than my old one and spaced too close together to accomodate larger items with thick handles so they slip all over the rack."
5,Great Dish Rack,"I have owned the pine variety with warping and eventually the slats pull from the frame. While it is still new, the bambo is a much better wood for the job and the construction far superior to the pine. Time will tell on its wear, but I believe it is a great improvement over the pine and I would recommend it."
2,"practical - but only for so long,","I agree with another customer who said there is no place for silverware. I was happy to ditch rubber or plastic dish drains for this type of product. It was very functional especially for my small space. Unfortunately it did not last more than 9 months. The bamboo slats are nailed into the frame. The whole thing fell apart in a short time. For that reason I would not buy another one. I love the concept, but I want a sturdier product for this price."
4,Pretty sturdy,"This stand is pretty sturdy, holds around 20-24 (2per slot)plates and 10-15 bowls. Looks good too.. Happy with the purchase much better than the cheap stands available t ikea...I haven't used it with wet dishes yet. 4 stars as I have used it for 15 days only.."
5,Nice bamboo dishrack,"As another reviewer mentioned, I ordered the pictured dishrack (with slats) and received one with dowels instead. I returned the one with dowels, and happily got the right one in exchange from Amazon. We have had a dishrack that is nearly identical to this one for years, but it needed replacing, and I'm happy to have found one that is so similar. It's attractive and practical and best of all -- not plastic!"
2,Not the same,"I purchased this drying rack, but I did not receive this drying rack. Instead of a rack with thick slats I received one with widely spaced spindly poles. They do not look very strong and when I tried using it to dry my dishes the dishes would not hold in the gaps at all and the whole thing seemed unstable. I don't believe this dish rack is long for this world...2 stars because even though they messed up, at least they sent me a dish rack and not a pair of socks or something."
1,Flimsy,"For me, the whole point of this product was the large size, and the ability to pull the steamer out of the pot by the extendable handle. (I like to steam a lot of broccoli at once, in a large pot.) PROBLEM: When trying to lift the ""loaded"" steamer out of the pot, the handle pulled right off. The handle should be strong enough to lift the weight of the loaded steamer, otherwise what's the point of the large capacity? Very disappointing."
1,Overpriced,The pistachios were not as described...they were stated to be jumbo pistachios. based on the price and average quality I find the Sunkist Pistachios to be of better quality and one third the price at Sams ClubLo of Minneasota
4,Horace's Hope: What Works for the American High School,I am an education major and read this book for one of my classes. I must admit that I was a bit sceptical of the idea that one could generalize so much about our schools and still maintain any sense of poignancy. Theodore Sizer has done a pretty good job of it. I was particularly impressed with the notion of setting his comments in story form set in a fictional school with a fictional character to embody his ideals. I found myself much more receptive to what he said because I had a face to put with it.
1,mother massage: a handbook for relieving the discomforts of pregnancy,"This book is massage 101 for people who are not trained in the least. It is not an appropriate book for any professional. Nothing is learned on a deeper level, in fact, this book gives instructions to massage areas that are on the contraindicated list with respect to acupressure...."
3,So-so knives,"I got these knives as a birthday present from a friend. While the set came in a nice wooden box (made in China) the knives are just so-so, they do not go through steak like butter as my friend had hoped, in fact they are in my opinion not worth the money it sells for. I would recommend Henckels' steak knive set, mind you the price for them is much higher."
5,"A wonderful read, Robbins' is an American gem.","Skinny Legs and All is both absurd and wonderously real.It had me laughing out loud one sitting and contemplatinginternational politics the next. Only Tom Robbins couldend a novel with the Super Bowl, a belly dancer and a conchshell on the shore of Israel. Ellen Cherry Charles andBoomer Petway are unforgettable. Also recommended:Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Jitterbug PerfumeNot recommended: Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas"
5,tom robbin's best,this book is the best of the four of his I've read. it's extrememly funny and is very typical tom robbins in it's type of humor and slant on the world.
1,Stopped reading,I make it a goal to always finish a book. This is the first one I haven't. The characters and story line were just too disjointed for me to see the book to the end. It was a disappointment because I do like Tom Robbins' other novels.
4,good book for do it yourselfer,I plan on siding my house in the spring of 2001. This book given the information that a do it yourselfer will need to do the job.
5,"Great product, performs well.","I had no delivery problems as others have listed. Arrived just fine, and works great on my dishes, we even use it as hand soap too."
5,"The first, the last, the best Barry White video!","Filmed in Belgium, this concert is the prodigious Barry White at his best, backed by his band at its best. The backup singers are beautiful. The string players are beautiful. The music is incomparable. The audience of Europeans is enthusiastic yet sane.Wienerworld really dropped the ball when they let go of the rights to this one. Now all we fans have left is the occasional find of an old VHS tape which may or may not be in good shape, and may or may not be in NTSC.His only other video appearance I'm aware of is a semi-animated feature by Ralph Bakshi entitled ""Street Fight."" It's good, too.Pity, pity, pity."
1,The worst sunglasses ever!,Think big and ugly. The shape is so odd that I wouldn't be caught dead wearing them in a closet. I tried to give them away but no one would take them!
2,Ambervue Night glasses,"The ""night"" glasses - very big- really don't work very well. There really wasn't much of a difference in the glare of oncoming lights. The ""sun"" glasses are also very big (on the ugly side- my daughters laughed at me)and I gave them away as a ""white elephant"" gift."
3,Does its job!,"This is a nice addition to my apartment as it covers the view of my study area/desk/shelf. It is a little light and the bottom is not perfectly aligned so it is somewhat precariously balanced. It's fine in my apartment but I would be concerned if I had small children or pets. The frame is not very sturdy either, and one of the panels is bending at the top from presumably the tension/weight of the fabric that is stretched across it. It is very pretty and adds a nice touch to the room without cluttering it. It is a lot of trouble/money to get it exchanged so I did not bother with doing that, otherwise I would give it 4 stars instead of 3."
3,"""I can remember""?","I saw this movie when it came out in 1968, I was 12 years old. I realy liked it then. It had action and out of this world effects. Now as an adult its just so-so. It did bring back memories of my friends and I at that time. As I can recall it was a much bigger production on the big screen, or was everything ""bigger"" to me back then? I'm not sure. God bless the star Mr. Christopher George. May him and this movie rest in peace."
2,Cheap but way too slow,"You get what you pay for with this drive. I bought two because the price was right, but these things are incredibly slow. Like USB 1.0 slow. They're inconsistent as well--they'll start a transfer quickly and then slow to a crawl, or vice-versa. You're much better off spending more on another brand."
3,Cheaply made,"The plastic ear for key chain was broken in the first week. However, the memory stick works fine."
5,Got a bonus,Kingston DataTraveler 4 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive DTI/4GBI picked this to try out and got a bonus. It speeds up my USB Aircard connection so I can even watch videos! handy piece of gear.
4,Kingston DT1 4GB USB Flash Drive,Works great as a backup for downloading digital pictures in the field. I use it at camera club to show slideshows and to do tutorials. They are great temp storage for downloading Photoshop tutorials from the web. I'll probably buy more now that I've found so many ways to use them.
4,Kingston rules,"This is a neat product, reliable, well liked, all my friends in college asked me to buy them either the 1G or 2G. Even my co workers bought. What more can I say."
4,Nice device,Have used this USB drive consistently for several months now without any issues. Very happy with it
4,Doesnt work with Ford Sync,I loaded this with 900 songs and it keeps knocking out the computer in my car. Nothing wrong with the drive it just doesnt work with the Ford Sync. I reformatted it to fat32 and that didnt help either. I use it for other data transfer and it works fine. I have an 2 older Kingston 4mb flash drives that both work fine in the car. I have 2 of these and neither one of them will work in the car and they both cause the SYNC to stop functioning.
4,Mem stick,Bought this usb mem because of the price--it was the least expensive and kingston's reputation for memory. Have not used this device.
5,Compuert Stick 4 GIG,"Use it to bring my computer data to my children's houses (Pictures,Excel spreadsheets,Music,etc) - very useful when going on vacation as I do not bring my computer, only my data"
1,No Driver for Windows Vista,"I don't understand why there is no driver that works with Vista. I have much older, cheaper flash drives that work just fine."
3,"Big, Cheap, Slow to Write","Title says it all. This is a great deal in terms of dollars/gigabyte, but in terms of write performance it leaves much to be desired. It takes a LONG TIME to load a 500MB file on it; copying the file OFF of it is just fine, and that's to be expected. The slower (write time) grades of flash memory are much less expensive than their higher speed brethren, and write times will always be longer than read times, but just be aware that you are buying the slowest grade of memory here. It's great for certain back-up routines and transfer, but not for everything."
2,Doesn't Travel For Long,"Works fine as a flash drive. I do not have very high requirements and don't use it in a way that I can comment on speed. Problem is that I ordered this drive so that I could hook it on my key chain and the hook at the end broke after 1 month. I am lucky that I saw it happen and did not lose the drive altogether.If you are looking for something you can reliably hook on your key chain and feel it is safe from falling/breaking off, I do NOT recommend this product."
2,Kingston Flash Drive,"Took longer to arrive than expected, and now that I have it the keychain loop broke off with very little pressure. Much less quality than I expected."
3,"Great price, good memory, poor design","This is a lot of memory for the money, works great, but it would benefit from better design. The plasice key ring attachment broke soon as would be expected. The plastic won't stand up to the torsion incurred by metal key rings dumped into pockets, maybe purses? As mentioned by others, the cap is easily lost as there is nothing attaching it and the fit is less than secure when sharing pockets with change and keys. I wouldn't buy it again; I would prefer a retractable with a sturdier keyring attachment."
4,Kingston DataTraveler 4 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive DTI/4GB,I am not a technical person and looked for simple and easy to use along with reliable. I got it with this product.
5,perfect,"This is a perfect jump drive for my purposes. It has a large amount of memory for such a cheap price, which might make you wonder about the quality of the jump drive, but it's perfect. I've never had any problems with it...I use it to back up all the files on my computer, and it's great for that purpose. I have a ton of pictures, music, and files on it. I highly recommend this product."
3,CHRISTMAS GUITAR CD,"Not really sure what to say but, I gave it as a present. No comment. It arrived on time as I was expecting."
1,never received instructions,"I was never able to try this product. I never received any type of instructions, despite an email request and a promise to send the instructions to my house."
4,Good but messy,"These strips appear to be as accurate as others that I have used but the reagents have a tendency to ""run together"" whereas name brand strips do not. Potatoes, potaatoes, they work. I just get an icky feeling using them. I will probably buy them again based on price."
1,crap,"This set includes a lot of irrelevant information ie..overly detailed information about computer terms like RAM. But, the other stuff that is specific to starting a cleaning business is not there. I seriously doubt the authors have any experience in this industry. This will NOT get you ready to start a cleaning business. Most of the other information is common sense This thing appears as if were written with very little or no research."
5,Very funny!,So funny! Really enjoyed it. You have to be open minded to watch it though and you will enjoy it. I think it's the best out of the Sasha Baron Cohen movies. A lot better then Borat or Bruno.
1,Anything else from Baron Cohen is better!,"An awful effort by the here-to-fore brilliant Cohen, vulgar and not particularly funny. South Park any episode is funnier in the first 2 mins."
2,"Simple - as expected, but so much room to be funnier","I laughed, but I know this could have been better. Hard to believe, but I kind of felt like they ""pulled some punches."" Was hoping for more of a Borat style performance."
3,Meh... OK,It was crude. I hated the political commentary. But it had some funny bits and was entertaining. Beware the vulgarity.
2,A Few Good Laughs,"I'm not a big SBC fan, but he has done some funny stuff. Maybe I should have watched the unrated version because this one was very slow and thin on laughs. By the way, Sacha, it's always good to take a cute woman like Anna Faris and make her look androginous, that always sells movies..."
2,Cheap,Anybody that is a fan of Borat and Sashas previous body of work will find this movie to be cheap collection of predictable jokes. Glad I didn't see this in theaters but I do wish I had waited until it was on network TV.
2,misguided by short description of the item,"Although the purchase process, the price, and the delivery were excellent, I have to say that buying in a non-specialized place like Amazon could lead to what happen to me: the short description of the item states ""Nikon UR-E18 Converter Adapter for use with FC-E9 Fisheye Lens"", and that is what I was looking for: an adapter for a FC-E9 fisheye lens for my Nikon 8400. BUT this adapter is for a Nikon 8800, and for my Nikon 8400 I need the UR-E16 that Amazon does not have. Also, I looked in the detailed technical description and there is not information about the camera. My fault? Yes, maybe, but hopefully this comment will help others to look or ask more details on some products. Finally, I got the adapter in a specialized photography store in Canada."
1,THE PRODUCT NEEDS IMPROVEMENTS,"I BOUGHT FOUR (4) RACOR MODEL ABL-1R BICYCLE LIFTS TO INSTALL IN A GARAGE WITH 12 FOOT CEILINGS.THERE ARE SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS RACOR NEEDS TO MAKE IN THIS PRODUCT: THE POOR QUALITY PHILIPS HEAD SCREWS PROVIDED ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO USE, EVEN WITH PILOT HOLES DRILLED IN THE CEILING JOISTS; THE FLAT LOCKING DISCS (ALSO POOR QUALITY ALLEN SCREWS) ARE SUPPOSE TO SLIDE INTO THE ALUMINUM RAIL BUT ARE TO BIG, SO THE RAIL HAD TO BE PRIDE APART TO WIDEN; THE ROPE KEEPS COMING OFF THE PULLEYS BECAUSE THE PULLEY'S VERTICAL SIDES ARE NOT TALL ENOUGH TO RETAIN THE ROPE.I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANY MORE OF THESE UNITS UNTIL THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS."
3,Poor pulley design,The space on either side of the black pulley wheel allows the rope to jump out of the groove in the wheel and run against the axle throwing the hooks off balance. I resolved this by running a wire through the pulley frame and loosly across the rope and wheel to prevent the rope from slipping out of the groove. The product works well but this problem should be corrected by the manufacturer. I will order another pair to lift another section of my HO train layout.DP
2,broke on 2nd use,"My 5 y/o daughter got this for her birthday and was very excited about it. Both her and her 3 y/o sister had a great time playing with it the first time, jumping and get wet as they played. They used it for 5 minutes today and it's broken already. My kids aren't big either, they are both average to small for thier age so it's not a weight thing. Her thank yous haven't even been sent out yet!!! Of course I don't have the gift receipt from the store b/c it was a toy we were keeping and using. Now I have to try to contact the maker of the toy. Buyer be ware."
5,FEMALE BODYGUARD,"J.J. Blair is sent to a South American country to guard a presidential candidate, Miguel Ramirez. She must pretend to be his fiancee, so no one will know that he has a bodyguard. J.J. works for the Dundee Agency out of Atlanta, GA. Fast running and exciting story. Ramirez expects his bodyguard to be a hard as nails, large woman and J.J. to petite and independent. They both want to be in charge, but come to an understanding. Excellent book!!!"
2,not the best available by far,I have owned panasonic cordless sets before and this does not even come close to the other sets i have owned
2,"Good price, questionable products","Of the three items in this package only the car charger worked as expected. I fully charged the battery with my existing wall charger, but after the initial charge the re-charge holding capacity continued to decline over the next week until now the battery will only hold a charge for about 6 hours - and that is without any talk time. The travel wall charger never worked. The light showed that it was charging and the phone indicator showed it was charging, but when the phone was removed from the charger there was no charge on the battery. The car charger works fine. To be fair, I have not attempted to return this package of products to the seller so I don't know if this is an exception to their normal product quality, nor can I comment on their return policy."
4,I like it.,We played selections from this symphony when I was in band in high school. This recording is true to the score and clean. And it has a nice cover.
4,A very nice Case,This is a very nice case I highly recommend it to anyone as a nice protective case for your fluke meter I highly recommend purchase of this.
3,His poppier side,"Back in the early 90s, Sparrow released two ""Best of"" CDs on Steve Camp, one with the lighter pop/AC fare that got Christian radio airplay (this one) and Volume 2, which tended to have his more driving and occasionally rock-tinged material. While this one DOES have some fine material from his post-Myrrh records material (particularly ""Do You Feel their Pain?"", ""Don't Tell Them Jesus Loves Them"", ""Run to the Battle"" and ""Living in Laodicea""), nearly all of them can also be found on the superior 2CD set ""The Steve Camp Collection"" (ASIN B000002UEM).BOTTOM LINE:Unless your favourite Camp tunes include ""Forgive Me, Forgive You"", ""Love that Will Not Let me Go"" and ""Revive Us, Oh Lord"" (NOT the Carman song), then skip this one in favour of the 2CD set instead. (ASIN B000002UEM) For more in-depth info about it, see my review of that collection."
5,The best dance album I've ever heard,"Naked Music always puts out quality efforts, always.Nude Tempo 1 remains my all-time favorite of their projects to date. This music is perfect for just about anything. The same beat pulsates throught the entire disc, but don't think for a moment that things get monotonous. Upon repeated listens you'll notice glimpses of genius that you may not have caught before -- some obvious and some subtle.Beautiful; sexy; hard-driving; smooth; jazzy; trippy; psychedelic; lush; you name it...that's Nude Tempo 1. A job well done and much better heard than written about.(I don't see how Miguel Migs can possibly top Nude Tempo 1, I really don't. But I will be one of the first to buy Nude Tempo 2 whenever it's released.)"
4,We're not in charge anymore,"Cynthia Felice creates an interesting future for Earth, one where humans have spread out to the stars -- and in doing so surpassed their Earth-bound relatives in technological achievements, wealth, and power. Left behind on a planet overrun by glaciers in a new Ice Age, those who are Earthborn (called ""icers"") resent the advantages that the starborn have. When an icer man and a starborn woman survive a shuttle crash together, it's the beginning of an unexpected friendship -- or is it?This is the first book I've read by Felice, and I hope she's written others set in the same Earth-future. I'd love to read more about the icer/starborn conflict, whether she brings back the same characters or focuses on new ones. Felice did a good job creating a realistic universe in only 185 pages. I'd love to read more!"
1,Poor product,"Having been in law enforcement awhile, I had seen a few guys with this product and thought it seemed really useful. I keep all my keys attached to my belt and threw this one on the keychain. The metal piece that holds the key to the keychain broke the second day. It worked well the one day I had it, but was frustrating to lose the whole thing on such a cheap part. Would not recommend buying this until that flaw is fixed."
1,disappointed,"poorly made. plastic seams not flush. expected better from streamlight. Overall seems cheap. I would go with a solid key next time. The good news? This one will probably break soon.Yup, it broke! Just from being on the keychain after a couple months."
1,Broke after a month,Bad design the actual metal key is attached to key ring by cheap plastic. Wont last in a scuffle. I did put it trough its passes but the key should not fall off no matter what.
1,The Cult of the Birthing Community,"Wow. First of all, mad props to all the women who could actually make it to the end of this irrelevant and outdated bs. Do you know why it is titled Spiritual Midwifery? Because if you're birthing a baby in the back of a school bus with an english major encouraging you to have sex (Helloooo I thought birth was about getting something OUT of there, not putting something IN!), miles away from anything resembling civilization, all you have is God to pray to that you and your baby don't die. I'm afraid the truth of the Farm won't really be revealed until the self proclaimed grandma of midwifery is not of this world any longer- like most cults, we don't realize what was really going on until much too late. Not only is this anecdotal crap hard to swallow, there is SO much horrible advice in here- like, oh just smoke pot during labor, or premature labor? Just go home and drink. This book is outdated and full of anecdotes that should not be taken to heart."
3,Good book but her other Guide to Childbirth is SO MUCH BETTER!,This book was ok. Her Guide to Childbirth is so much better! This book was more geared toward midwifes and not so much toward pregnant women.
2,bad material,"The design of the basting set is good. But, the choice of material is bad. The rubber bulb as received is already aged especially around the area that grip the basting tube. Color between rings that grip the basting tube has changed and ready to separate if the bulb is pulled from the basting tube for cleaning."
1,they're a stinker,I honestly think this is the best band under 20. Not saying much since there are no good bands under 20.....
4,Not for my new dvd player,"Not practical to work out with on a computer, on tv it would have been better. Smart how it was made. I was curious about it, and something different to Leslie. We had a region free player until that broke"
1,False advertising,"This article is not 7000+ words or 27 digital pages. Although interesting, it is only 1 page (369 words) and not worth $6."
4,Needs to be updated,"I've traveled throughout Baja the last 2 years and found the book is very out of date. Many of the campgrounds mentioned have closed and some of the sites are no longer suitable for camping, for others, the nature/quality of site has changed. This can be a big problem if you've traveled to some out-of-the-way location expecting a certain level of accommodation and find it less than sub-par. HOWEVER, being a person who normally avoids the 'organized, Americanized' campgrounds the book is very useful and it is book worth having."
5,Actually.....,"Bill is not showing mediocrity-far from it. He is showing maturity. This CD features the enormous talents of Ralph Towner and Eddie Gomez. If you do not like the genre, that is one thing. But writing off the efforts of three of the world's finest musicians is very silly to me. For example, if you want to learn how to play a ballad, one of the hardest musical forms to master, listen to ""Forgiveness"". Very insightful. Sure, Bill trims it down a bit, but good for him! I believe the playing on this album shows that musicians can grow and stretch when they restrain themselves from doing what they're expected to do. Just a thought."
5,Very helpful,My dad has been having trouble getting out of bed. This product has been a great deal of assistance. The aides at the assisted living were able to set it up easily. He has been able to keep a little more independence.
3,Not what it seems to be!,"This product claims to be an introduction to german while it really isn't. All the sales hype on the outside leads the customer into thinking that it is for beginners' use, while the books inside the case tell you that it is meant for intermediate learners. It was very hard for me to use for this reason, but I suppose that it would be ok for intermediate learners to brush up on their German skills."
5,"This is BLUES, not rock!","This guy is one awesome blues guitarist. He is incredibly powerful in his delivery and the guy on Sax in his band has a couple of fantastic covers. He has a wide range of styles but power and soul leap out of his songs and delivery. This is a definite must for Electric Blues or Modern Blues lovers everywhere -- Trust me, you can't go wrong. Just listen to ""Exception to the Rule"" -- it rocks!"
3,Worth $25... but the legs break,"Seems sturdy and well made but the legs have some poorly designed plastic inserts that break and make it useless. don't pay more than $25 for this item. it's decent for still cameras but doesn't have the smoothness needed for video work (panning, etc)."
4,"OK, but with a bit of problem","It's worth the price. The only problem I have is with the 'pop-up' button in front of the manual screw that holds the camera to the pad of the tripod. It's supposed to poke the hole under the camera to prevent the camera from moving side-to-side on the pad. Button is so small that my camera moves laterally by about 20 degrees. Maybe, a replaceable or adjustable button should be provided to minimize this problem."
4,Decent Tripod,"The first tripod I received had the head snapped off. I got a replacement shipped very quickly though. This is a good all-around tripod, seems sturdy, lots of adjustments, and works with my digital camera and lightweight video camera. The bubble level is crucial. The price is right; my friend bought the lesser model from a local camera shop for $20 more than I paid."
4,Good basic tripod that has excellent height.,The tripod has excellent maximum height when fully extended. The weight anchor provides more than ample support on a windy day - use your own judgement if the winds really pick up. The build quality is above average. It may not be suited for the Professional but is more than sufficient for the casual user. There is a handle to carry the tripod when the unit is fully collapsed. A good buy - don't be fooled by the low price.
2,"Another ""Cropped"" dvd","4 stars for the movie but only 2 for the dvd release.Chopped off the top and bottom as well as the sides.I don't know how much is missing on the top and bottom since I have not seen a full screen version, but it says it is ""matted"" on the back of the dvd. Turner Classic Movies aired this a month ago and it was chopped on the top and bottom the same, but showed more on the sides. They always say ""matted to preserve the original aspect ratio of the theatrical release"" on these disks. Clearly since TCM showed more then it was not done the same as the theatre. Not that the theatrical aspect ratio is always correct. I have seen many movies that when you see the unmasked 4x3 video, it is much better."
4,Great fun.,"This is a fun adult comedy where ""adult"" means appealing to non-children and not for obscene content. Natalie Wood and Tony Curtis are good together but Henry Fonda and Lauren Bacall steal the show as Tony's bickering married neighbors. Natalie is gorgeous here and any fan should buy this movie for that. For the rest of us, just sit back and watch some funny situations grow to out-of-hand laugh riots.Some of the dialog and attitudes are clearly out-of-date but really, for a movie over 40 years old, it isn't that far from today's outlooks. In short, you should be entertained by the jokes and situations anyway. Recommended"
3,coffee cup holder,got this for my husband to carry his starbucks home in. He had a lot of trouble with it splashing out. Now uses the little green plastic thingy they can give you to stick in the steam vent. It works a little better and he doesnt lose so much.
3,"Great for coffee cups, but not much else","The biggest problem with this holder is that it is not adjustable in any way. You can adjust how tight it connects to the handle bar, but that is it. You cannot adjust the size of the holder or the angle at which it sits. What this means is that if your handle bar doesn not have a spot that is parallel to the ground this holder is useless. It is not a problem for me but it should be stressed that you cannot use this holder unless you have handle bars that are parallel to the ground for at least a few inches.The size and shape of the holder is perfect for to-go coffee cups, but not that great for almost everything else. Smaller soda and water bottles will slide right through it and larger ones will just kind of sit on top and wobble around a bit.It is built well and installs in only a minute or two. If you primarily are looking to hold coffee cups and have the right kind of handle bars this will work just fine. If not then you can find better options."
1,"""Not in stock""","""Not in stock"" is what I always eventually hear when trying to get this product, a-f-t-e-r, of course, I complete an order and have been waiting a week. This product is no longer being made! I put together a state of the art computer in 2004 using this leading edge ram, made by Kingston no less, and it is now no longer made!!! Spend half a grand on a computer and throw it away in 6 years!Beware, if you are lucky enough to get something at a premium from some collector then make sure you realize that it comes as a kit that contains (2) sticks of 1 GB ram. Not every vendor understands this and may only send you half of the kit (1 GB stick of ram)."
5,A soulful reflection of serenity and contentment with one's lot.,"My Own Places: Poems On John Constable by Don Kerr (Professor Emeritus in the Department of English at the University of Saskatchewan) is a collection of free-verse poetry from brief lyric poems to extended narratives, all inspired by British landscape painter John Constable (1776-1837). Constable's work had a local quality that reflected his unwillingness to travel far from home. A handful of black-and-white and color images of Constable's artworks illustrate the collection. A soulful reflection of serenity and contentment with one's lot. ""Sleight of Landscape"": he pruned a tree / and chopped a willow / enlarged a house / cut a gable / he planted trees / dug up a hedge / moved a church / from here to there / and a windmill too / drew down clouds / out of thin air."
4,Tsubo Tenax shoes - guarenteed to get compliments!,"Cool shoes, Every time I wear them I get compliments. People ask where I got them, I tell them I found them while traveling in Europe (a lie).The quality is great, something you might expect from an Italian shoe, not Japanese. The only complaint I have is that the laces keep coming untied because they are the round nylon type, I would suggest replacing the laces if you buy a pair.Overall I would give these shoes an A-"
5,Beyond Amazing! This is a great piece of work by all,"This must have been a Propellerheads-inspired venture after their huge club hit with Dame Shirley (Goldfinger) Bassey a year ago, ""History Repeating."" What a great idea to have some of the top mixers (hey why wasn't Mixmaster Mike of the ""Beastie Boys"" given a shot here) update a few of Ms. Bassey's classic tunes. The album is nothing short of phenomenal. There is hardly a weak song in this Millenium collection.""Diamonds are Forever,"" ""Never, Never, Never,"" ""Goldfinger,"" and ""Where Do I Begin,"" are all covered here.By the time the album ends you'll be demanding more. A sequel is surely in the works here."
2,"Pinnacle Waxes may be very good, but their customer service is terrible","I have wanted to try Pinnacle Wax on my classic car for more than a month. I emailed the company 6 times so far with a product specific question so that I buy the right Pinnacle Wax. Their product may very well be very good, but their customer service is TERRIBLE. I have emailed them 6 times so far, and they have not had the courtesy to answer even one of my emails. I was really looking forward to see if their waxes were as good as some people claim. For, bar-none, the single most expensive car wax that I have found on the market you would think that they would at least put some priority on their customers, sadly they do not! They apparently want to just sit back and take your money. I have been happy with the wax I have been using, but wanted to try theirs to see if I would notice a difference in either shine or longevity."
5,Exellent follow up to Peace B,"This is a exellent follow up to her korean debut ID;Peace B!More R&B than pop.If you like JLO then no doubt you would like this cd.You can tell BoA has grown since Peace B.Recorded at the same time as her Japanese debut Listen to My Heart.Ironically both went to #1 in their countries of release.Yet both sound totally diffrent.This disc contains extra stuff.Downloadable posters,behind the scenes video,and pics."
3,Not worth it. Too little info,"I bought this book after reading the awesome reviews here. But it has disappointed me. Did not find anything new. Info is all too basic and you can find this by visiting couple of good web sites like WebMD.I recommend ""Multiple Sclerosis - The questions you have and the Answeres you need"" instead of this. It has very exhaustive info of all different areas that a person interested in MS should know about."
1,Yikes,"Don't waste your time and money. Next to ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane"", it is the biggest waste of celluloid. The most horrifing sceen is Connie Stevens topples, trying to change her image. Frankly it could turn you off of women for life! Good thing she changed from acting to selling make up. Shame there is not a minus star rating for this dud."
5,"Nice litter pan, easy to clean","Nice litter pan, easy to clean. Small, so good for smaller cats. I use mine for my rabbits. Glossy finish is good for wiping clean."
2,Too Small,This litter box was too small for my cats. The sides weren't high enough. Would be good for small cat that doesn't dig a lot.
3,Floh De Cologne - 'Faaterland' (Westpark Music),"Initially put out in 1983, as I believe this to be Floh De Cologne's last proper album. Not near as good as their earlier titles like, say - 'Fliessbandbaby's Beat-Show' ('70), 'Profitgeier' ('71) or even 'Geyer Symphonie' ('73) but I will say that even though this swansong of theirs runs under the thirty-minute mark, it still has it's moments nonetheless. Somewhat worthy tracks here include the rocking ""Die Erste Millionen"", ""Es Gab Eine Zeit"" and ""Der Amerikanische Freund"". Completists and die-hard fans will obviously get more out of this CD reissue than casual fans, like myself."
3,what the h$ll is it?,"Sounds cool. I can not find any reference to this album on WIKI. would like to know who these friends are, etc. Can't say I didn't like it. I love Todd, Todd is God, and it is hard to screw that up."
3,NOT Made in USA,"These rawhides were advertised as made in USA. The bag states they are made in South America. Would prefer to have accurate manufacture location information. Product quality is good, price is fair."
4,Loves them!,"My Dog loves these, they keep his chewing urges under control...He gets exited as soon as he sees them!"
5,Satisfies my picky pooch!,"A retriever's gotta chew! That's what they do! My bowser tends to ignore most synthetic chew toys (nylon, rubber, etc.) and material 'toys' rarely last 5 minutes regardless of 'quality' (meaning price!). I give him one of these rolls each morning after breakfast, and it satisfies his need to 'chew' all day. (As a puppy, he ate an entire couch, the walls - even my lawnmower!) These are good, high quality, leather chew rolls, in quantity, at a great price. Through Amazon, a 1-click order brings a 2-month supply to my mailbox. Now that's service!"
3,good product but open,My dog loves these and I love that he doesn't go through them as fast at the knotted ones. But when we got the package it was ripped below the reseal spot. So now I can not close the bag!
2,Cadet Rawhide Retriever Rolls Going Downhill,"I ordered these back in 2011 and they seemed to be of good quality. I continued to reorder and it seems to me the quality is getting worse as the price goes up. Initially, when purchased, they were tightly wrapped full sheets of rawhide that took my dogs a very long time to finish. I have a bully breed that can go through one in a very short time if it isn't high quality. She has incredibly powerful jaws. However, over time I am finding the interior of the rawhide is little chips of rawhide. I thought it was a fluke so I ordered another bag or two. These are even WORSE! The interior was blackened and even smaller shards. I cut these in three sections for my little Havashire to eat because she has to have what ever the big dog has. She doesn't want a small chewy. Some of the pieces are getting lodged in her gums and I am very dissatisfied with this product. I won't be getting them again. I can't pay that much money for a hit or miss product."
3,Lyn Hamilton,Kind of fuzzy and not as well written as the earlier Lyn Hamilton mysteries. I would read more if there were any but the author passed away a few years ago.
4,Quintessential Eighties Synth Music,"Midge Ure and Ultravox really hit their stride with this disc. If you want to know what all the fuss was about in the early eighties, take a listen to Vienna. MTV was just starting out, haircuts were as important as musical chops, and English groups were making the most interesting music. Despite the ephemeral nature of the music at that time, Ultravox managed to rise above the crowd (The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls, Spandau Ballet, etc, etc), and create music of lasting value. I still enjoy this album very much, even though I was a freshman in college when it first came out!"
5,An easy to follow handbook on treating yeast disorders,"Dr. Crook's ""The Yeast Connection Handbook"" is an easy to read, self-help guide to understanding and treating the problem of yeast disorders. This book I found much more ""user friendly"" than the original version ""the Yeast Connection"" because of how it is layed out: content, font-type, chapters, etc.Dr. Crook gives hundreds of references and case studies that can assist the patient when talking with their own physician. This was especially helpful for me and my husband when dealing with an HMO doctor that had little knowledge of the subject or its treatment.This is a valuable book for ANYONE (man, woman and child) that has had various ailments or recurring infections and wants to get healthy!Here's to understanding ""the yeast connection"" and a better life!"
2,too text-book,"This book is geard purely for the novice. It gives little insight or insiration for change. I felt as though I was reading a text-book. If you are looking for books too ""move"" you on this subject read any book by Geneen Roth."
2,Lid Gets Removed,"Like the other reviewer mentions, the lid is far too easy to remove and there's no hinge or anything to keep the lid permanently attached to the box. Needless to say, my 15 month old is more interested in pulling off the lid than he is in sorting the blocks. I'm hoping that I'll be able to find the lid when he gets old enough to learn how to put the lid back on and use the toy the way it was intended to be used."
2,Major design flaw..,It's a great well-made box with fun blocks. I just wish there was a way to lock the lid in place. My kid keeps taking it off and at 12 months there is no shape sorting. She just takes the lid off and puts the blocks (and whatever else) in. This toy does not really service its original purpose for us.
5,Highly Recommend,"Professor Halcoussis takes a very complicated subject and delivers it in a very comprehensible manner. Most authors try to impress their audience with complicated formulas and mathematical jargon, yet they completely miss the point. Understanding Econometrics by Halcoussis is written in a manner that is not too technical so that you can actually teach yourself, as I have.I've had the privilege of studying under Professor Halcoussis' supervision and can honestly say that I've acquired a better understanding of statistical concepts and applications than in any of my other previous courses. I highly recommend this book to anyone taking a statistics or econometrics course as an outstanding supplement. I've always said that no subject is too difficult to comprehend given the right guidance and teachers: Professor Halcoussis has captured this essence."
1,Very poor performer,"I would never recommend this printer.We bought three of these for a school where we worked and all three had quality print issues. They ghost-printed the top of the page onto the middle and bottom. Even after we bought new cartridges, the same problem occurred.I personally have a Brother HL-1440, which is a great printer, so I thought these would be just as good. I was embarrassed when my strong recommendation turned out so bad."
4,Good except for curling pages,"Overall a good printer. Especially good if you just need it to print things you are going to read or use. If you neeed professional quality, the curling of the pages may be a problem."
4,Nice but noisy printer,"This laser printer is fast. It is however quite noisy. The printer pages curl quite a bit. For the price, it is a good economical mono laser printer. The replacement off-brand cartridges are inexpensive compared to other laser printers. Overall, I recommend this printer."
4,Great Service,We've had 3 of these printers. So glad you can still find them as they seem to be the only one that works with our particular mobile desktop.
2,"Great, unless you want to print envelopes from WordPerfect","Everything is great about this little printer, especially the price, but don't buy this printer if you want to print envelopes from WordPerfect. The online 'help' and e-mail 'help' is as terrible as any. I can print envelopes from Microsoft Word, but not from WordPerfect."
5,Great Printer for the Price !!,"I bought this printer mainly for my High School daughter. It fits nicely in the small area I had open for it. I had it set up and printing in about 5 minutes. It came with the toner cartridge and I purchased the USB cable for $5.00. So far, it works great. Quick printing and very crisp. The paper did curl, but ever so slightly... once I left my document sitting for a little while it flattened itself out.I'm quite happy with the printer. A lot nicer than the old inkjet I replaced!!!"
3,Semi Dispossable Printer,"This is the second 2040 I've had, 1st one lasted about a year (paid $150 for it) before the drum went. Drum costs more than printer at local stores. Bought a new one for $100 (new drum, new catridge), again it's lasted just over a year and the drum light is on again. So I'm shopping again. Money wise I got my money's worth and it worked fine all year. Environment wise I don't like dumping these in the landfill because they can't make a drum that'll last longer than a year, or at least provide a cost effective replacement."
2,"Fast, but not worth it","I wish I'd read the reviews before buying this printer. It's fast and the print quality is fine, but it has the paper-curling problem that other reviews mention. It doesn't matter too much with one or two pages, but for larger documents it can be a problem. Also, the toner ran out after just a month, which I wasn't expecting. When I bought this printer, I thought I would get an updated version of the reliable 1440, so I was disappointed to find out that the 2040 is a whole different creature. I wouldn't buy this printer again."
1,"Too much ""toner life end"" -Brother's quality is getrting worse.","My company bought 5 HL2040s for different depts 6 months ago. Recent 3 of them got the same problem- "" toner life end"" even replace several brand new genuine toners. My company now is planing to buy a color laser jet to print catalog but no one recomand to buy Brother's product- cheap price cheap quality and it wastes too much time if we want to fix it by warranty. No more ""Brother""."
3,Disappointed,"Color looks different, but the worst are the drawers. The four bottom drawers are really two deep drawers. Was not advertised properly! Very disappointed, especially since I bought it as a gift for my daughter! Would not recommend!"
5,Solid. Looks great.,Detail is great. Very well crafted. Packaged extremely well. Great price! $200 less than local furniture store. Only negative is it's imported like almost everything now.
3,Not one of his better ones.,"In this installment of the Wilcox series, Carl goes to Podunkville, and argues with a pharmacy owner who turns up dead the next day. Carl starts looking into the murder, and finds that the dead man's family has secrets they don't want revealed, and he does find a few motives for murder, but winds up catching the killer and making them confess. Motive wasn't anything new, and plot was noticablely thin."
5,great.!,loved this.! i totally need this for intro to psyc.! it came it quick and helped me ace my test.!
3,Book is great Website that suports the book is terrible,"The book is slightly more interesting than your average textbook. The internet site is terrible. I successfully used it once to study for an exam and it was wonderful. I had all these interactive flashcard games and online tests. I tried to use it to study for my second exam and most of the features I found to be so helpful were not working. Then, I started e-mailing text support. I got automatic replies, and messages from a man who stated and I'm parapharsing, ""Worth Publishing has invested a great deal of time and effort into working out the problems with this website. We are devoted to get it up and running properly."" The website hasn't worked properly since then, and that was two weeks ago. If a company is going to advertise a website that supports a textbook, it should work. Just another example of marketing departments pumping up a product that the developers are just not ready maintain and support."
4,The ordinary experience,"Rediscovering the Felt Presence of God seems challenging but Rolheiser makes it ordinary. This book has deeply affected the way I view my experiences. It has returned as sense of worship and connection with God not only in my prayer life but in everyday experience. This book is a little deep but stay with it... you really don't need a degree in theology to ""get' it you just need to want more of God."
4,"It has it's quirks, it has it's qualities","I have had one of these for about a year and overall I like it a lot. Previous comments about it firing grounds out at the speed of sound if the little swingie door is opened are correct. Don't do it! Yes, a few grounds will spill on the counter regardless. It's still a million times better than the old blade-style I used to have, and the glass graduate is really quite effective at not holding static charge. Problems with clogging are periodic and worse if you grind your coffee fine. I've had to clean it once in the past year and I thought it was about time to clean it out anyway. It has a very small footprint on the counter, should outlive me the way it is built, is louder than a leaf blower. All that said, I am just about to buy another for work. I like the way it works, quirks and all."
5,Nostalgic fun for middle-aged former Commodore gamer,"Spent many fun hours playing Pirates. I had the C64 game back in the 80's and loved it then as well. OK, probably pretty low-tech for today's video gamer! I can play up to the ""Rogue"" level, but not quite ""Swashbuckler""! Much depends on your dancing and fencing skills, as well as strategy and doing things in the right order."
3,Buggy but beautiful,"A very fun and wonderful updated version of the old PIRATES & PIRATES GOLD games that we all know and love from the 80's and 90's.It isn't easy to improve on one of the greatest games ever made but it is done from the addition of Missions and Pirates havens, to the quest for revenge to the various types of shot and upgrades to the ships.The Land combat is MUCH better as is the use of landmarks for treasure maps.The fly in the ointment and it is a BIG one are the bugs. This game made my 6 month old system crash and crash again. There seems to be an issue with some Intel graphic chips that I was able to resolve after about a week. It is the reason why this game gets the 3 star rating. People want this stuff working out of the box. If a computer tech like myself has to spend days chasing down a fix (which was NOT provided by the publisher) then most users will not even want to try."
2,Fun while it lasted,"I pre-ordered this game thinking it would be great ,based on the reviews. It was realy fun at first ,but soon became boring and monotaenous .I'd recomend buying it used as I don'think it's worth the sticker price ,but it is fun."
1,Frustrating and Slow,"Don't try and play this game with the ""minimum"" system requirements. While it can be done it is outragouesly slow and dancing is nearly impossible. I upgrade my RAM to 512 and I could dance and do all the things in the game but I must say it is outrageously easy. First time I played I ended as Mayor and second time as Bishop. I won't be playing a third time, as it is just too repetitive."
4,Almost perfect,"Holds a lot, use it ontop of a Honda Odyssey and can get stuff in/out without a problem from either side.Only issue I have is the brackets that hold the claw-like clamps on the underbelly have a tendency to fallout when off the vehicle."
2,Just an okay read for me,"I found this book, at times, very slow. The mystery was unusual, but not really solved. The couple was very likeable; but, the romance does not develop. I also had problems with Jerrot's inconsistencies on several of the storylines. She doesn't know what to do with Rik's daughter; and, you're not real sure why she bothered with inserting her in the plot. Ms. Jerrot didn't know what to do about the subject of birth control either. Each love scene, seems to cover it differently. I also had a problem with a horseback ride that the couple take. While behind Rik on a horse, the heroine describes seeing sweat roll down Rik's throat. Physically, I don't believe this is possible. Is it poor editing? It seems a sexy book like this one, will be appreciated whether there are weaknesses or not."
2,Disappointing,"This was the first Michelle Jerott book I've read, and I have to say I was disappointed (especially since I like her books written as Michele Albert). Unlike some other reviews, I liked the historical sub-plot that drove the story. My problem was with the two main characters and the attraction between them. The chemistry between Rik and Annie didn't develop in any kind of believable way. I felt like I was told there was chemistry without seeing it. I kept asking myself ""why are these two people together?"" As for the so-called ""honesty"" between the characters, they went from being argumentative and mean to each other, to deciding they would become lovers. Overall I didn't much like Rik's character and wish romance authors would move away from the idea that a man has to be a jerk to be masculine and sexy."
4,Don't Judge this book by its cover,"I usually strongly dislike Christian fiction, with its cliches and sappy sweet answers to life's big questions. Here is an author not afraid to have a heroine that is outside the box in her looks, but also her faith. This is an earnest attempt to describe what really happens when someone meets Christ for the first time and how her life changes as a result. This book takes on its topics with a light hand, but is unafraid to address real issues facing real people with love and humility."
5,Loved this Book!,"I loved this book. It begins with Mayla Strong giving her life to Christ in her Mother's church. She has purple hair, pierced lip & nose, and no desire to change her outward appearance.Her insides are 100% changed, however, as she begins her very personal relationship with God. This relationship brings her to a hostile, anti-Christian roommate, a gay man dying of AIDS, church members not too sure about her and other various people and problems.This book made me giggle, brought me to tears, and made me rethink how I perceive people to be, based solely on their looks & dress. I am reminded that God loves all of us according to the inside, not the outside.I received this title a free download for my Kindle from Amazon, but as soon as the sequel comes out for Kindle, I will be purchasing it. If it takes too long to become available for Kindle, I'll purchase the paperback!"
1,Blah,"Started out ok but after while it got really annoying and felt to ""preachy"" for me as I am not a religious person. Was excited about the good reviews but I did not like it at all. Definitely disappointing. It also seemed extremely repetitive. Maybe if it wasn't so repetitive i would have enjoyed it more. Don't know about that though, had to force myself to finish it."
2,hit and miss,I grew up watching SNL. Unfortunately half the jokes are kinda antiquated.I'm sure back then it was funny but it hasnt aged well.Some of it is good but i wouldnt get it for more than 25 bucks
5,One of the best.....,"A great book from Meirovitch, the father of vibrations. Like all past books in vibrations authored by Meirovitch, the present book covers every topic, but now in a state-of-art fashion. As a software application,very will written MATLAB codes are included.I think that this book is going to be the standard vibrations book in near future."
5,Made in USA!,Its a shame something basic like an adjustable wrench of good quality is so hard to find. I used to buy crescent brand wrenches. About a year ago i picked one up to purchase at my local hardware store. I noticed they were different looking. I also noticed USA was not stamped on it. Upon looking at the package i saw MADE IN CHINA :( I vowed never to buy another crescent wrench again. I looked online for USA made tools and came upon Sk tools. Their stuff is good quality. Reasonably priced. And all their tools are american made. It SK all the way from now on
5,THE BOOK BANDIT,"I think this book was what a good ghost story should be like! I mean who wouldnt like reading about a creepy little ghost girl out to posses bratty heather?!! This is one of my favorite books!sincerely,THE BOOK BANDITp.s: youll be hearing from me soon!"
5,TO GOOD TO PUT DOWN,"I've read this book about 8 times. And it just keeps getting better. I got the book and it's so good and I've read it so much it's came apart. If you haven't read it, Read it!! It's a ghost story for all agos youg & old."
5,great book!!!!!,i love this book i thought it would be scary but it really wasnt i loved it. i love how molly and heather got along at the end. it made me tear up alittle. overall i think this is one of the best books i ever read!!!!!!!!
5,A chill just for you!,"Ive read many Mary Downing Hahn books so which book do I like the most? I like this book Wait till Helen comes. This book is about a little girl named Heather, Heathers older step sister Molly, Mollys little brother, and of course Helen the ghost. Helen is trying to drown Heather and lure her into the lake. But Molly tries to save her. Will she return?"
4,Creepy Helen,"I had to read this book in class, when I was in the 5th grade as part of our reading assignments. I have always loved to read, especially ghost stories,my favorite isThe Dollhouse Murdersso I was naturally psyched to get started! When we started I could not put the book down! I ended up finishing the book two weeks ahead of schedule! This story has all the elements for a good spine tingling read, A scared teen girl,who is afraid of her own shadow, who then ends up being our brave hero, and a bratty little kid, who you secretly wish they would just kill off in the beginning, but you end up hoping they get saved at the end, and a very creepy secluded location, and a scary ghost to haunt it! Needless to say it has been 14 years since I have been in 5th grade, and I own a copy of this book! To this very day I can read this book, and still get alittle creeped out by the little girl and her ""friend"" Helen! If you love ghost stories and reading you'll enjoy this book!"
3,Good Book for Adolescents,"This is a good story, well told, but younger readers would enjoy what it offers more than adults would. The tension between Michael, Molly and their half sister, Heather, becomes tedious. Helen, the apparition, is compelling, vicious yet vulnerable. The parents, Jean and Dave, are nearly clueless about what goes on in their own house which adds to the drama. I did not anticipate the ending which is unique."
5,Ben's Review of Wait Till Helen Comes,"Wait Till Helen Comes is a great book. It is scary in a way that makes the hairs on the back of your neck rise up, but not in a way that will give you nightmares. I like the fact that it shows that you cant judge a book by its cover. The only thing i didnt like was that i got throught with it so fast that i wish it was longer because it would have been great if i could have spent more time reading it. I recommend this book for children who love ghost stories, haunted houses, etc. However, if you have a child that is easily scared, and i mean REALLY easily scared, this book is not for your child. Consider this your warning. (This is for everyone else.) I loved Wait Till Helen Comes and I think you will too."
3,okay but i expected more,"The book was good don't get me wrong, but i didn't feel the story fulfilled what it could have. For starters the suspense would build but then it let that fall. The scariest part in the whole thing was the ending, to me, and even that wasn't all that scary. I suggest the book to anyone who doesn't like books real scary but still wan't a chill now and then."
5,cute bag,"I love this bag. I got it for Christmas, and I've used it a lot since then. It has a lot of room for a full-sized wallet, keys, sunglasses, cell phone, a compact and then some."
5,"Cute, Colourful, Fun!","This is a wonderful story about a mischievous dog named Desmond and the things he gets up to in a day's play.The pictures are simple, big, bright, colourful - very eye-catching and fun for kids. Our son loved to look at this book from 3 months of age, and it is still one of his favourites at 17 months.Every page has a pull tab that makes Desmond come to life in some way. You'll just need to be careful with little hands trying to pull at the tabs and moving parts!A great book for babies thru toddlers!"
2,Thinking About A Harrier? SEARCH THE WEB!,"I bought this book and I read the entire book (93 pages, with children's book size font) I can't say it took long. There were some nice pictures in it, but nothing you can't find on the web. This is just a small coffee table book. If you are interested in Harriers and want to learn about them, search the web instead."
1,A Masonic Fantasy,"An interesting fantasy of one Mason's experiences, written by a non-Mason. If you are not concerned with factual information, this book is interesting reading. It Chronicles the rise of a Mason to reaching the ""top"", and his troubles along the way. It is disturbing in the way that the Mason replaces his religion with Masonry. Then towards the end he denounces Masonry claiming that his loss of site is punishment from God for worshiping false Idols. Several claims to the Masons ""high"" stature are falsified, as well as ""authentic"" information on Freemasonry. I would not reccomend this as a factual read, nor a read for those just learing about the Masonic Order. I would instead reccomend ""A Pilgrim's Path"" by John J. Robinson for people interested in the Order. If you are seeking a purely fantasy story, without factual interest in the Masonic Order, then you will enjoy this book."
1,Lying for God?,"The sad part of this book is that it will add further fuel to the anti-masonic fire. The same hollow arguments are brought out and served in the same old fashion.Interesting how Jim Shaw falsified his rank in the Masonic Fraternity. The authors of ""Is it True what they say about Masonry?"" have uncovered Mr Shaw's demit letter and it tells a diffrent tale than the one in his book. Could this be a case of Lying for God?I guess we now know what the true Deadly Deception is. Unfortunately too many will be deceived. Unfortunately, those who will accept this man's words are unlikely to read a book like ""A Pilgrim's path"" by the late john J. Robinson."
4,[Three-and-a-half out of Four stars on reg. rating scale] Very good effort here.,"'Reputation is a fragile thing', a popularband once sang in a song back in 1982 (CT).Credentials matter not when the contentsprove that something is not right and theauthor honestly attempts to uncover some-thing that intends, w/ duped followers, tostay hidden (or is it 'hoodwinked'?). No,the author may not have the 'cariculum vitae'so to speak, to attack the octopus of Masonryhead on ON EVERY POINT [see my other reviewspls., readers for more on masonic nitwits...]but so what! Good is done in the daylight andevil in building w/ windows painted shut, andin darkness!"
5,Rene's Review,I enjoyed the book immensely. I read it in one sitting because I just could not put it down. I especially liked the middle and end of the book where she starts to become enlightened and begins to be able to go on with her life. I bought 7 books and am planning to give them as gifts to friends who truly love poetry.
4,Good Product; Moderately Substantial,"The product is well-designed and easy to assemble. While it certainly wouldn't double as a chin-up bar or anything like that, for three big towels and two big terrycloth robes on the hooks at the bottom, it doesn't bat an eyelash. I might not recommend it for households with kids that climb on things... Aside from that, I'd definitely purchase it again."
4,Fun entertainment...,"I wasn't expecting _fine_ literature so I wasn't disappointed. The novel was not as quite as fun as the first due to flashbacks and unnecessary extra information that made some sections a bit of a wade. She has yet to develop some characters such as PB very well but there is promise. And yeah, the sex 'scene' with Sergei was juvenile.But the real fun in this series is her take on ""magic"", Ask any of the advanced practitioners of qigong and they should tell you, if they're being honest, that a lot of what she describes is actually true. The inner sensations and some of the abilitie actually exist in individuals who have trained to a hig enough level. Even written spells exist - they're called ""fu"" - and, yes, they do work.Too bad the organizations that oversee everything don't exist...Yet?"
3,"Strong Rubberbands, or don't bother","This workout is only 30 minutes, which Greggains is famous for working you over in the least amount of time, but this workout will be a joke unless you have some maximum tension rubberbands to work with. You'll be wasting 30 minutes of your time otherwise."
2,Sizing Is Off,"I wear a 12 and ordered an XL based on the other reviewer that said that she wore a size 10 and the large size was the right fit for her. These are huge, would probably fit at least a size 16. So I'm sending them back."
5,Great way to encourage kids to believe in themselfs........,"I think this book is really cute, it shows the importance of holding your head up high and knowing that you are special, as well as the importance of Grandmas. I'm giving this to my grandaughter just as soon as she's old enough as I think it's just perfect, the pictures are so funny, the story is just the right length as well as a having a great message. I think any kid would like this book but little girls would like it best."
5,"Stand Tall, Molly Lou Melon","This is a great book. It teaches kids to accept and appreciate who they are. And, the illustrations are a hoot!"
2,Disapointing...,"I decided to purchase this disc after going to an awesome Treble Charger concert. I liked what I heard there and enjoyed their singles so I thought Id enjoy this disc. But unfortuantley I was wrong, very wrong. Sure, the first time you listen to it, it seems fine but then its gets boring, so boring that you cant take the songs. Its so bland and annoying. I regret the $13 I dished out for it so take my advice and leave Detox on the shelf. Youll be glad that you did. You're not missing anything."
5,An excellent nonlinear systems book,As a Ph.D student I found this book very helpful and I would like to recommend this book everyone involved in nonlinear systems. I also have Vidyasagar's (i wish there were more example problems) and Khalil's nonlinear systems(mainly devoted to Lyapunov analysis) books which are also good but I found this book much explanatory than others.
5,So good it made me cry!,"I thought I knew a fair amount about the Beatles but this wonderful book filled in so many gaps in my knowledge of the band's early years. The story of those magical two weeks in February '64 is told compellingly and with fine detail but also with deep emotion. And the book's concluding pages, with the author sitting in the churchyard in Liverpool where it all began, moved me to tears. A great book worthy of its subject!"
4,Excellent game for younger children!,This game is great. It has excellent graphics and is a lot of fun to play. A little challenge for the younger gamer (my son is 5) but not too challenging that it will lose their attention. This game is great for the 1st timer.
5,This is one of the best books that I have ever read.,"This book is about five friends and an Andalite who have a secret, they have the ability to become any animal whose DNA they acquire. They think that they can get their Andalite friend home by stealing a Yeerk bug fighter,boy were they wrong .............. You will have to read the rest if you would like to know more, and believe me you will."
5,WESLEY SHARPS amazing story of the predator,"I liked this story because it had animals and other things like aliens it had andilites and yeerks.andilites are good yeerks are bad yeerks try to take over your body by making you a controler and the good guys are RACHEL,CASSIE,JAKE,MARCOE,TOBIES,and AX theandilite."
5,Slicin' Knife,"This knife was the one recommended by Cook's Illustrated, and they were right on! I love it. It works as promised, and I had space in the existing knife drawer (oops! forgot to check, but it worked out)."
5,Nice knife (very big)...Outstanding purchase,"Great knife, price, shipping. highly recommended.I didn't quite realize how large this knife is (really shape too). You'll need plenty of room to do the slicing.I wish I could find a sheath for the blade. I recommend opening the package on the edge near the handle (along the seem) and use the packaging to protect the knife (and anyone handling items close to the knife....VERY SHARP!!!).Very happy with purchase (ordered two).Another GREAT advantage of purchasing from Amazon is they sent the knifes to two separate locations...all that shipping was free (PRIME) and arrived on-time (early in one case).Thank you for fine service!!!!"
4,our new knife,"Over all an excellent knife,sharp, could be 2ines. shorter. Should have a plastic cover case safety when putting the knife away."
4,Great slicer,Recommended by Test Kitchen on PBS as good value. Slices perfectly and stays sharp. Just be careful because it's easy to accidentally cut yourself when handling or storing.
4,The Colors of Life,"""The Colors of Life,"" is a very worthwhile collection of poems. Each poem featured, shows great imagination and feeling from within. Many reflect things that have happened in ones life time. From an authors' viewpoint, I believe that Mr. Ely has selected poems that will appeal to all age groups, and bring much pleasure to the reader. I am pleased and honored to be selected, as one of the authors to be featured in his book."
2,I'm on page 1 too! coincidence ?,"I'm on page 1 too! coincidence ? I too have ""The Colors Of Life "" in my hand, and my poem ""The Flu"" is on the very first page. I don't know how reputable this company is now that we have our poem on the very first page...Paul R."
5,A Writer of Poetry,"I'm not sure how it happened, but I am the author of the first poem on Page 1. ""Shallow Tears written by Jackie S. Kidd (ME)""I love this book. There are many talented poets in this book, besides me. I definitely recommend this book to any aspiring and long-time poets! I want to buy another book since I only have 1. I have blessed many people with this. The Colors of Life broaden many horizons defining Depression to Hope and Faith. It is our experiences in life that bring this book to reality. I never saw myself as an artist. But recently learned that there are many forms of art. I have a passion for writing in particular. Although, I do write short stories, screen plays and lyrics. And I found a new passion for photography. Look for my stories in Free PUblications in my area. ""Our Town"" and ""Summer Weekly,"" to name a few. I'm working on a few stories called ""The Woods, Red Sky and The Storm."" I hope you get a lot out of this review. Stay Safe! Peace!"
1,FM transmitter is the worthless,"I purchased a starmate 4 and got the car kit for it. It was purchased as a second radio, I have a older sportster that works excellent. Then purchased a new car and decided to use the starmate 4 for the new carthe sound quality was unbearable from the FM transmitter. Every radio station was bleeding in on it worst part is I was on a 6 hour trip. FM transmitter is worthless, I'm looking for a new FM transmitter adaptable to the starmate 4 or if I don't I'm trashing the piece of junk."
1,Cradle QuickGrip Part No.05400 NO GOOD,"I have both an Atlantis 1600 and an Atlantis 1800. Good boxes. Problem is with the attach system. While simple, it was probably designed by a Swedish monkey. The part that sits on the cross bar of my roof rack fails at the screw attach point. It is a very weak fitting and held in place by one screw. The monkey would tell you this is not a bearing point for load. Why then does it always fail in this spot?? Get this - the replacement part is $2.60 from Thule direct AND they want $20 for shipping... Now that's a business model!"
4,Easy and does what we want!,"We have a light directly outside our backdoor with a motion detector pointed to the right and a spotlight (with no motion detector) to the left. The light without a motion detector is activated by a switch...if we forget to flip the switch, no light to the left.This product solved that for us. Yes, it feels cheap, but you're probably buying it because you don't want to spend the money to have a ""real"" motion detector installed. The product installs easily and quickly and appears to have a 10-12 foot activation distance.You might want to play with the ideal height (we're about 10 feet off the ground due to a small porch) for the motion detector to actually get a good angle downward to your yard.All-in-all, we're very happy! It does what we need it to do and at the price we wanted! We're considering getting another with the adapter to install in our alleyway."
4,"Works well, be prepared for a lot of 9 Volt Batteries","I use two of these and they work well in general. Details re times lights stay on and go off, light sensors, etc. some times work, some times not, but overall doesn't matter. If you are having trouble, it's usually the battery. Goes through lots of 9 Volts if you use it overnight on a regular basis."
3,"Good guitar, great value, but needed a lot of adjustment to tune","Fun mini guitar! But it came way out of tune, and the strings hit the frets when initially played. After adjusting the strings to the highest level it was still contacting the frets, so had to adjust the neck to pull the strings higher. Once that was done the sound improved dramatically. Great starter electric guitar at a great value, my 9 year old loves it!"
1,Never received,After a long wait for this poster I received an email that it was out of stock. Not necessarily impressed with this company and do not plan on ordering from them again.
4,Much better than most of their recent stuff,"OK... I like Pierrot's indies music... Make that LOVE their indies music... I haven't really liked their newer stuff (like ID ATTACK), but this CD is pretty good. The remixes aren't as good as the originals... Jisatsu no Riyuu and Torikago both lost a lot of feeling vocally in this album, but all of the songs are bearable.... I usually dislike remixes by any band, but Pierrot managed so somehow make it work for them... I would recommend the original CDs first (especially Pandora no Hako), but definitely try this CD/DVD set. If you want to be taken back to when Pierrot still had their own sound, get this. It's a bit (ok very) expensive for a CD, but it's worth it."
1,Trick,"This is not the novel as it appears to be, but a review of the movie of the same title from 1967"
1,Bought one Remington WDF1250SS not from Amazon,"I bought one Remington WDF1250SS, not from Amazon but from other store.Used it three times in six months and it has stopped working now.I would suggest not buy it. But still if you are buying, be cautious. Try to use it many times in warranty period."
3,Note From the Author,"I am Barbie Bellinger, the author of Benjamin and I'd like everyone to know that I'm revising this book to eliminate most of the foul language. I didn't realize just how much was used until I read reviews from others."
3,manhunt,"THIS BOOK WAS:A)VERY WELL RESEARCHEDB)VERY OVER-RATED--I AM DUMBFOUNDED THAT IS A BEST SELLER!THE FACTS ARE WELL EXPLAINED, BUT THERE IS FAR TOO MUCH SUPPOSITION AND ""LITERARY LIBERTY"" TAKEN BY THE AUTHOR. HE IS VERY REPETITIVE AND DESCRIBES INCIDENTS VIVIDLY THAT HAVE NO BASIS IN FACT--NO ACTUAL WITNESSES OR EVIDENCE--JUST THE AUTHOR'S SUPPOSITION......AND INSTEAD OF A ""HISTORY"" BOOK, OR ""DOCUMENTARY""...IT RESULTS IN A NOVEL. I ALMOST STOPPED READING IT HALFWAY THROUGH....MANY COMMENTS HAD BEEN REPEATED 2--3--4 TIMES, AND I FEEL THE AUTHOR USED MANY WORDS TO TRY TO IMPRESS THE READER---WORDS THAT 90% OF PEOPLE HAVE NEVER READ, 95% HAVE NEVER HEARD,AND 99% HAVE NEVER USED. I WAS LEFT VERY UN-IMPRESSED."
5,Excellent,"This was an excellent book. In the spirit of a fast paced novel, Swanson puts us on the roller coaster that was the assasination of President Lincoln and the chase for his killer: John Wilkes Booth. Swanson is a fantastic author. I stumbled upon this book and was so happy with the find. I could read it again today. I suggest you do as well - you will enjoy it. JVD"
4,Good read and hard to put down,"I would agree with most all the reviews' I read that this is a very good book and an enjoyable read. It is a book even those who don't read much history would likely enjoy as it reads like a mystery or crime novel at times. My only complaint is that the death of Booth I though overly romanticized. When the author writes ""As strangers at Golgotha did for Christ on Good Friday's cross, Lucinda answered his plea."" was really over the top I felt. But aside from the drama of Booth's death I would certainly recommend this book."
4,"A Great Read, Filled with Information","Manhunt by James L. Swanson is an exhaustive account of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln and the ensuing search for John Wilkes Booth. It also gives a detailed account of the movements of Booth throughout his 12 days on the run. If you like history, and are even slightly interested in this topic, this book will be enjoyable. The writing is clear, the historical subjects come alive and you will find yourself greatly anticipating the next chapter.Great book!"
2,"Lots and lots of little words, but little content","Although sometimes entertaining, this is a light-weight and over-written account of one of the most important events in American history. The style recalls the days of authors being paid by the word, and it seems to have been composed for an audience of pre-teens. The overblown language used to describe Lincoln would have made that most skeptical and irreligious of presidents laugh. (His ""sacred blood,"" and the ""sacred locks of hair"" of the ""martyr."") One who read this comes away thinking Edwin Stanton, the ferociously partisan zealot who frequently referred to Lincoln as ""the baboon"", was his most loyal disciple. Nor is much said of such key figures as the president's missing guard, John Parker, or of the suspicious behavior of Stanton and others which has historically given rise to serious questions of a wider conspiracy. In a book devoted to the assassination and the hunt for those responsible, these are very serious omissions."
5,Could. Not. Put. It. Down.,"Believe the reviews. The book is wonderful. I'm a late-thirties college professor, and I gave it to my seventeen year old nephew, and we both loved it. We bonded over it. It's excellent."
5,"Manhunt, clearly the best historical novel I ever read!","If you are interested in events that shaped our country's history, do not pass up this book! While we have all heard of John Wilkes Booth's assasination of Lincoln, this book paints a dramatic detailed picture of the events immediately before, up to, and including the capture of Booth and his conspirators. The story is so vividly told, with such robust detail, it will seem like a story that you never heard before and don't know how it will end."
4,So runs the world away.,"This is a very good book about the Lincoln assassination. It is a very detailed account of the murder and it's aftermath. It reveals a lot of little know, but fascinating, facts about the events. As the author says in his opening note, ""what happened in the spring of 1865 is far too incredible to have ever been made up."" Civil War buffs need to read this book, and anyone else who is interested in American history will enjoy it, too."
5,Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase to Catch Lincoln's Killer,"A very good read. For those who like to read history like a fiction story. Keeps you interested with factual information. Well, researched."
4,excellent,"History is not my thing, but this book was so exciting to read. It was put together so thoughtfully and with such detail, I felt as though I was finding out firsthand what happened during those 12 days. There was one point when I was literally holding my breath to find out if Lincoln would survive his wound (I know, I KNOW!). Truly exciting. At this point in time I have purchased 3 and lent them out only to buy another... and lend it out. Do it."
5,"Manhunt, The 12 day hunt for Lincoln's killer.","I read this book for my book club. Nonfiction is not usually my choice. I did however really enjoy the book. It was not at all like reading a history book. There was suspense. You knew in 12 days that John Wilkes Booth would be caught, so you knew the chase was coming to an end. It was interesting to see what facts are known now that came out years later and how John Wilkes Booth influenced so many others to join in his scheme. We think of Lincoln as a beloved president, but many at that time did not like him. I was anxious to continue reading and learned a lot. The book club discussion was very interesting."
4,Wonderful historical narrative that reads like a mystery novel,"As a history major, I was a little skeptical when I began reading this, for (as all good history majors are aware of) a narrative is not the best way to ""do"" history. However, this book is a wonderful addition to the works already written about Lincoln's assassination and Booth and Herold's attempted escape. It has its fair share of quotes and endnotes, so it is clear that Swanson did his research in writing the book. The best part about it, however, is not in the historical aspects, but the way in which it is written. I found myself unable to stop reading once I picked it up, for although I knew the story and the end results, the text itself was incredibly addicting. Overall, it may not be the best historical source because it is a narrative, but it certainly does serve as a fairly accurate source and as an incredibly entertaining read."
2,Hmm...,"I watched this on Hulu on a night that I was exhausted and just vegging out. Too lazy to even get up and turn it off. I give it 2 stars because the countryside scenery was good and I liked her different hairdos and the period costumes. Shortly into the movie I was like hmmmm? when this 1930's family let the 16 yr old daughter bunk up with her older lover inside the house. Then she was on trial and there was a baron, but I didn't know where he came from. He was just there all of a sudden. He was an idiot to put up with her shenanigans and give her gobs of money. And this woman was an idiot to have the hots for this secret agent spy who left all the time without an explanation. The worst thing about this movie was the editing. I wondered if I had fallen asleep and missed chunks of the movie that left me trying to figure out what was going on. I was relieved when it was all over...zzzz."
1,Sprayer does not work!,Hooked it up and only water comes out of the sprayer. Sprayer design is defective. Extremely poor quality control by Cutters! From reading all of the other reviews this is a common problem. Wasted 1hr of my time trying to get it to work to no avail. Don't buy it!
2,Not what it used to be,"I agree with the many reviews that have problems with dispenser. Didn't have a problem when it was new on market. Chances now of getting a spray nozzle that actually works are about one in three-five. Some break, some just fall apart and some won't syphon the fluid from the bottle. It does help control fleas and mosquitoes if you can get it sprayed but it's not worth the hassle."
1,Cutter Backyard Bug Control Spray Hose Insect Repellent,"I regret I didn't read these reviews before I purchased the product at Lowe's. The portion of the sprayer that connected to the hose separated during use. I reconnected the hose connection to the rest of the unit, but quickly experienced another failure. It's surprising that the manufacturer allowed this defective product to be distributed so widely."
1,"Doesn't suck, and doesn't kill mosquitoes any more","I have used the Cutter for about four years, and other than having trouble getting it to siphon, the poison worked very satisfactorily. In the past week, I sprayed my grand daughter's yard, and my yard, at HUGE concentrations, and the mosquitoes have laughed at the poison and eaten me alive. There has ALWAYS been a problem with the siphoning, especially if you used only a partial bottle and went back later to use it up, but the poison doesn't work any more, so what's the point."
2,Cutter Back Yard Control Spray,I have tried this two years in a row and have the same problems as some of the others. It does not seem like the product is dispensing with the water. It is frustrating b/c I don't need to water my back yard due to the swamp in the back. Not sure why the product will not dispense as it should not be that complicated. Is there a trick to it...am I doing something wrong? If anyone can add a comment to help..it would be great. My next step to is call cutter directly. Maybe the bottles that the product came in are not good. Anyone? Thanks! Tami
1,Buy a true in-channel visor,"I purchased this product because it was an in channel visor and it did not have the leg to obstruct the side mirror. What I received was a set of visors that were difficult to install. The right side did not fit at all and the tape was notstrong enough to hold the visor in place. I had to use an old visor that I had. You have to buff the felt of the window channel and clean it before the last preparation step. The last step is to wipe a preparation substance inside the channel of the window. The package that the preparation substance is in warns to not have contact with your skin, but there are no gloves provided to wear while wiping the preparation fluid on. Also after installing, it is recommended that you leave the windows up on the vechicle for at least 24 hours for the tape to adhere. I would recommend not buying this product. Purchase an in-channel visor that has no tape and do not worry about the leg that is in front of the side mirror."
4,Must have for the auto upholstery person in your home,"Covers it all, teaches you the in's and out's. When you see the interior oa automobile and ask yourself how did they do that or thats what I like in my car this book shows you how. Remember one thing if you are a beginner, you have to practice and put your heart into your work or it's a waste of time."
4,Guide for new beginners.,"Takes you through the whole operation, from sewing machine to finale products. If the pictures had been better, it would get 5 stars."
2,Sewing not Restoration,"This book might be good if you want to use a sewing machine to painstakingly create your own auto upholstery from scratch, but it never even mentions the plethera of available upholstery kits out there today. Most auto restorers use these kits because they are much easier, cheaper and a closer match to the originals. If you want to learn to sew this is your book, if you want to know more about replacing your classic muscle car's interior without purchasing a sewing machine, this is a waste of your money."
4,Slightly Disappointed,"I love Toby he's my favorite country star, yet I found this CD to be missing something. White Trash With Money was awesome I loved every song on it but this one there are just a few that just don't seem to fit. Over all though if you are a Toby fan it's worth adding it to your collection there is far more good songs than so-so ones on here."
1,oklahoma mother,first of all the tray did not latch properly and the batteies ran out every day (almost) and after just a month of use the motor went out and we had to buy a different swing. We bought the linkadoos swing and we love it the batteries last longer and we've had it for almost a month and it's still going strong!
5,A great swing for a calm kid,"I purchased this swing after using the Fisher Price Aquarium swing for my daughter. She is 5 weeks old and is a very calm kid who does not like a lot of things going on(Stimulation with loud noises and bright lights). The aquarium swing was great but it had too much going on for her. She would just cry and get scared. She now loves the Colby. She would stay in it all day; happy as can be if I would let her. I do agree the toys are a little noisy for an infant, but I just purchased other Graco toys at Babies'R'US that do not make noise and she loves them. I love the speeds and trhe music. This is the best swing I could aks for. I really enjoy the diffrent positions of the seat. It allows my daughter to lay down or sit up a little. Great head support for infants."
4,Buy this swing!,"This swing is a God-send! I have a pretty cranky month old and he loves his swing. I don't think I would have made it through the first month without it. Assembly was very simple and easy. My son loves to look at the bears up above and even likes the sounds of the tray toys when we activate them for him. I have found nothing else that can soothe him more than this. We don't use the music feature, but all the other extras make this swing worth the price."
2,Already is showing rust stains on base poles,I put this item together 3 days ago and already I noticed rust stains on the base poles. I'm still waiting on a response from Graco about this but this doesn't seem right. I haven't even been able to use it yet. It's just been sitting in my livingroom and it's already showing rust stains. Not sure if this is a defect or not but I would be cautious.
5,5 Toys for the price of 1,"The best thing about this fishbowl, is that each piece can be played with separately. The clam squeaks, the fish jingles, the starfish rattles, and the crab crackles. And my 9 mos old loves pulling them all out of the bowl again & again."
3,Don't believe the hype,"Yes, this toy is cute. Yes, this toy has many textures to stimulate baby's senses. Beyond all of that, this is the last toy my son picks to play with. I squeak the clam and I crinkle the little crab for him to no avail. He's off and crawling to all the other toys on the floor. It's a very cute toy, but I don't think I would rush to buy it if I had the decision to make again."
3,Not our favorite Lamaze toy,"My 8 month old isn't really into this toy. It looked like fun to me, but we've had it for a coupld of months and he rarely plays with it."
1,What do you use this for?,I had thought this cable would transfer photos from my Samsung phone to a computer. Apparently not. Still not sure then what the purpose of this cable is?! A waste....
2,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly","I do like the design of this product. The trays are a great addition to a cutting board. On a practical side, its is a little long for most kitchens. Four to Six inches shorter would still be a usable cutting board workspace, and would fit much better on most kitchen counter tops. The trays hold about 5 cups, it would be nice if they were graduated in some way to measure smaller quantities. The real problem is, after only 3 months, the boards are starting to come apart (unglued)! And this is after religiously rubbing it down with mineral oil since the day I received it."
3,The DISSERTATION on Natural Dyeing.... whew!,"Although packed with a vast amount of information on natural dye history and formulas, this book reads like a dissertation. It's lengthy and exacting on all accounts. If preparing and using natural dyes sounds like something ""fun"" to do, this book may just leach all the excitement right out of you."
1,WTF?,"These were hard to read and their results didn't match up with a more expensive brand. If you don't care whether or not you can pass a UA, then maybe they are for you. I however wouldn't rely on them."
2,tripleA.org,"if u like axis and allies, visit tripleawarclub.org and play an axis and allies like game, new maps and new rules if u want to use them or stick with classic!!! its free! tripleA tripleA.org tripleawarclub.org"
4,Awsome,"This game is a very fun World War Two based game, and i've been playing Computer Games sience i was about six or seven, and i know great games when i see them, and this game is great, between Graphics and the Unique Units i suggest to buy it."
5,Great game,"This game was the first ""build an army"" type game I ever played. I thought it was really good. I loved how you could build special units for every general and there were mutiple generals and 5 country choices (Germans, Americans, Great Britain, Russia, and Japan). The graphics are good and the sound effects are too. Overall, I definetely recommend this game to almost anyone above 7. I don't really understand why it's rated ""T"" though. Because in the game there is no blood. And when your squad kills someone the person just falls down or goes flying. And it's not even zoomed in. The only problem is MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH VIRTUAL AND PHYSICAL MEMORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Otherwise the game will be slow)"
3,Either elegant or cryptic--can't tell,"Many terms are created by the author and the book lacks a glossary. Regarding the Kindle edition, not having page numbers made it impossible to keep up with my class discussion."
2,"Average retail, misleading","Item count says 100, shipping weight says 6 pounds, why did I receive 1 ear shipping weight 0.6 pound ?"
1,Very Inconsistent Sizes,"I normally buy pigs' ears two cases at a time for my large dogs to save on shipping fees. The first two cases of this brand that I purchased were nice large ears. The third case contained very, very small ears. Each was roughly one-third the size of the ears in the first two cases. I haven't opened the fourth case yet, but I won't buy any more of this brand, regardless. EDIT: The fourth case had the same small ears as the third one. I have posted a couple of photos showing the size of the tiny ears received here vs. the nice large ears received from a different company."
3,Buy only if you have a fat wrist!,"I bought the watch for my wife for Christmas. It apppears to be a nice watch, but it also appears that you can not adjust the band. The watch slides up and down her wrist like a bracelet. At this point it is unwearable. Just another item from amazon that does not fit the bill."
5,"Great product, shipping and service!!!",This watch is absolutely beautiful. I had been eyeing it for awhile for my girlfriend. I finally bought it at a great price. I could actually bring it to a jeweler who would pay me twice what I bought it for! But then my girlfriend would kill me because she absolutely loves it. Shipping was super fast. I have bought jewelery from amazon a couple of times now and have never been disappointed. Thanks again.
5,The Greatest Book I Ever Read,"This is one of the greatest books I have ever read. Only wish I had read it 35 years ago. I now give it to every young couple in my family or who is a friend, who is getting married. It is a perfect guideline for their lives to work together. I even corresponded with the author on how wonderful I thought it was. A must read for all newlyweds. Very touching and moving for the soul."
3,Good rousing music - pity,"Good rousing music especially Hesta es Sevilla. Her superhit Angelitos Negros always affects me; if the Rev King had been hispanic, it could have fit in with all the civil rights songs. Pity that at that time in her life she had to cater to a younger generation and chose to include strange arrangements of Mil Besos, Magdalena and Espinita. I've owned the original issue since its release and just converted it to digital."
5,"Tantalizingly written novel of intrigue, friendship, and loyalty","Gracie is an American missionary serving in Russia who doesn't think she's very good at her job because she hasn't led anyone to Christ. Only days before her visa expires and she must leave the country, she discovers two friends and fellow missionaries have been murdered. Now she must rely on FSB (formerly known as the KGB) Captain Vicktor to protect her from becoming the next victim of his arch nemesis, The Wolf.This is a wonderful tale of suspense that is filled with beautiful moments of Christian discovery and growth. Susan May Warren is a wonderful writer who transports her audience into the heart of Russia so skillfully that your senses are nearly overcome."
3,Disappointed,My son had this on his wish list because the description said it came with rubber feet. He needed a cutting board that would not slide on his granite kitchen counter. When it arrived he was disappointed because it didn't come with feet. He still has the problem of a sliding cutting board.I am glad to see that the description no longer says the board has rubber feet.My son has used this cutting board for a year now. It has held up well.
5,A Great Series,"Pinnacle Certified has always been undervalued by collectors and one of my favorite products. I have never pulled less than 3x the purchase price in inserts alone anytime I have bought this set. If the seller had more, I would buy them.The cards themselves are beautiful and there is little to no evidence of the quality control issues that are common in most sets. In other sets, I have found the painted fingerprints of the factory worker that handled them when the gold trim was still wet, packs with a middle card only crushed. Boxes where the corners of only one pack were damaged, and cards that are printed off center in the more current years. These are present far too often from other brands, but never in Pinnacle. They tend to be underpriced compared to other sets with the same average pull values."
5,Flotec Electric Swimming Pool Cover/Utility Pump -...,This pump works great. I have owned similar pumps from other company's which have failed in less than two weeks. In the instructions it states never to let the pump run dry or run out of water to pump. I do not suggest that you do this but I have done it a couple times and it still works perfect. I have even had it frozen under the water on the pool cover and when I got it out it still worked. Six stars
2,"mucho potential, but overhyped","I heard a lot about this guy and I really wanted to like this one, and yes, Wiley definitely has talent. But from the retro-hep cover design to the atmospheric but static arrangements and (over) production to the stiff vocal phrasing and show of affectlessness this is a disk that just sits there waiting for you to like it, or think its cool. There's not enough conviction/credibility, on the one hand, or pop grab for your eardrum on the other. The lyrics are fairly pretentious as well. Comparisons to Tom Waits and Bob Dylan are completely laughable. Potential is there, but might need to rethink where he's going with this. He's got some good ingredients but seems to be overreaching at this point."
2,This is a really hard game.,"This game's hard. You unlock characters but there's a lot of characters who arn't in the game. The Toa arn't in this game. Takua the Chronicler isn't in this game. Neither is Hahli, Kapura, Nuparu, Tamaru, or Kotu. I'd get the other Lego Bionicle game for Game Boy Advance instead of this one."
4,... best game review,it has mild vilonts itis one of the best gamesitis for everyone the rating is efor everyone itis for kids anyone can playthat game.
5,Best Basic Game Programming Book,"The Revolutionary Guide to Qbasic is by far the best book out there for programming games in basic. It is filled with chapters on sound and graphics that nearly every other book on the market neglects to include. I make games in my spare time and until now have been picking apart other games and asking more experienced programmers how to write complex sections of code. Well, no more! This book has it all: 3-D scrolling, tile based gaming, creating music, and more. Why buy another book about how to make a loop or print data to the screen? This book it truly the best way to advance your hobby in Basic programming."
3,"Works, but gluing is a little dodgy","The instructions ask you to thoroughly wet the glue side of the paper, which is reasonable, but in practice it's hard to know what's enough water, too little or too much. An online video would be helpful. I applied it to a couple of plywood doors I wanted to blend into the surrounding plasterboard wall a little better than would be the case if I just painted the plywood. It went on OK, but in the process of drying it bubbled up and I thought the project was going to be a total failure. A day later, however, the bubbles had flattened out again, so that was OK. However, when I trimmed the paper to the edges of the plywood I had to use additional glue (I used Titebond 2) to get all the edges flat against the plywood. This worked fine. All in all, I would recommend this product, noting, however, that you may need to partially re-glue."
5,This book helped me get through a really cold winter...,"What can I say? This book reads like a manual for ""how to live your life"". I just let my friends pick any letter from the alphabet and we just explore the new horizons that were previously denied to us. This book has not only helped me in my personal life, it has helped me in my career. It serves as a tremendous ice-breaker whether at company parties or just water-cooler talk around the office. I don't have a negative thing to say about this book. It makes a great stocking stuffer! Great for anniversaries, Mother's & Father's Day, and graduations. Buy it now!!!"
3,nice,"I love the size of this board- lots of surface area but not so heavy that I can't move it easily. The wood is high quality, looks nice. In addition to the pastry templates, there are ruling increments on the back that are in cm as well as inches.Both sides are smooth."
4,Teeny Tiny Too Wide,I had my cabinets refaced and wanted to replace the pull-out bread board (some call it a cutting board) and this one sounded like it would fit. I need to have it professionally sanded down a smidgeon to fit in the slide in opening. Good quality board. I may even try sanding or using a plane to narrow it down to fit.
3,"Warps, not a cutting board","I bought this product as a pastry board and cutting board.I found it fine for pastry, although it almost immediately needed an oil surface treatment. A little scrubbing is needed to get the flour and bits out of the markings which are imbedded in. If you use the markings, you will find yourself converting to metric or rolling sidewise to use the side markings which are oddly placed. Otherwise, it was sturdy enough and a good size for most home baking needs.However, it should NOT be used as a cutting board. It can't be cleaned with even a small amount of soap and water without warping. It seems to be the way it's put together. I flattened it back out with some heavy pots, but when I lifted them off and let it sit it started to warp again.While a lot of the reviews have mentioned the other uses, it is NOT listed as a cutting board for a good reason. This really should have been made more clear. Otherwise, a good pastry board for the price."
4,Magic in the Middle Ages--a kind of sampler,"This was on the reading list for a course that I took at Boston University a few years ago--Magic, Science, & Religion--and for the broad span of history and topics that we covered in that course, this was a good starter.As another reviewer mention, it's hardly the complete study of magic practise and evolution in the Middle Ages, but it contains some excellent sources and gives the reader a decent idea of what they will be getting into when they do other research in this. If you're just beginning study of this subject, this is as good a place to start as any to give you an overview.My only complaint, honestly, is its length--because it *is* rather short. There is enough time and space covered in the course of this text that it could include more detailed information, more historical sources, illustrations, and become a genuine text book (and, honestly, it's a subject deserving of a text book)."
2,Rather Lacking,"This book has about 200 pages of information. At best, I would call it an OVERVIEW, but by no means complete. I was really disapointed by the lack on information regarding Pagan ties to magic. The total number of pages relating to that topic is 7. 7!!! Thats pathetic! Divination is barely touched on... this is just an extremely breif book. I honestly wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they wanted a concise text about Magic in Literature of the Middle Ages. That is honesly the only topic explained enough."
2,"""Magic in the Middle Ages"" is a good source of medieval info","'Magic in the Middle Ages' takes a profound look at an important part of medieval culture that is most often overlooked by authors and even by professors in the field of Medieval History. The practices in the mentioned time period had major affects on the subsequent practices Europeans. Also, the study looks at the thin line between what were considered religious rituals and that which was considered magic. It looks at the views of Europeans that were heavily influenced by classical thought up until the prohibition of the so-called odd practices of the different types of magic began. It assimilates some of the superstitious practices of today with those of six or seven centuries ago."
3,"buying ozium 14.5 oz. & .5oz. as a "" best buy""","although i have used ozium air freshener for years and consider it the best product of its kind on the market. i feel that putting these two products together as a ""best buy"" deal is misleading in as much with shipping and handling from two separate vendors makes this what could best be described as a ""worst buy"".Although I'm happy with 99% of Amazon purchases...let the buyer beware."
5,A gem of a book,"I have just completed a Graduate Diploma in Teaching for high school Physics and would have loved to have had this book earlier in the year.However it will still be a very helpful text, small enough to always have on hand, to draw on to better understand where students are coming from and what their conceptual blocks might be.Overall, an insightful treatise on the subject of teaching Physics!"
3,Confusing content,"The content in the book appears top notch, however I bought this book to try and get into tailoring/hobby sewing under the impression this was a book on tailoring jackets...and yet there is ONLY photos of womens jackets inside. The techniques in all likelihood are transferable to mens clothing but it is EXTREMELY confusing to receive a book called 'Tailoring: The Classic Guide to Sewing the Perfect Jacket' that has no mention whatsoever of mens clothing when classically women did not even begin to wear suits until the 19th century, and not in large enough numbers to even really mention until the 1970's.Very much debating returning to amazon for being so misleading but I will have to speak with my tailor friend first and ask if the techniques can be transferred."
3,It's an Ok Camera,"This camera is ok. it takes the picture and the quality is ok. i love the size and color, that was the reason i got it. i havent had any problems with the battery life. All in all this camera is okay, i would recommend it if you want just a simple easy to use camera!"
1,Horrible waste of money,"This was my first digital camera that I bought without doing any research. The first thing I noticed is that is was hard to review the pictures. I had a hard time manipulating the menu. I had to keep reviewing the manual. The battery life is short even with auto turn off set to 2 minutes. The LCD screen became increasingly dark to the point where it was impossible to see. I took a few pictures anyway and they were very dark. This is an awful camera. As I do research for my next camera, I see other people have had lemons as well and were able to send them back. Definitely buy a camera with a warranty and save the receipt until you've had the camera awhile and tested it in all lighting situations."
1,Cheap! the price says it all....,"I got this camera for christmas and 4 months later it was already broken! I barely would use it too. The pictures looked horrible, you can never the lighting to look right. Even if you try every different setting, it is always either too bright or too dark. this camera is cheap and thats all there is to it. If you want a cheap camera thats exactly what your going to get with this camera. My suggestion, by a more pricey camera with a warranty, its way more worth it in the end!"
1,JOJO'S NEW HOROSCOPE FOR 4/25/2005,NOTHING NEW. YOU'LL SIT ON YOUR UNTALENTED 1-HIT-WONDER WANNABE KIDDIE ASS AND KEEP FLOPPING UNTIL YOUR BANKRUPT BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO TALENT!

O, it already did, so it will go in THE HALL OF FLOPS, where ""Baby Its You"" is also located, as well as your album."
4,"pretty good for a 1st FPS online game, but needs improvement","for the 1st 30 minutes the control might be lil TOO confusing(considering that this is a PC based game). however, once you get use to the control, this game is amazing. if you are looking for an addictive game that you can get into for months, this is it. the problem is, the sound [is bad], and you cant communicate with your teammates. but there if u have bunch of friends playing this game, and you all have a broadband or 2 phonelines, you can call them, using 3 way or hav 2 people use 3 way @ once to communicate with 4 people at once. then use a speaker phone or a headset(headset is better). this way, the whole team can communicate, and if opposite team doesnt know this method, then u can easily smoke them. overall this is a VERY VERY good game."
4,"Awesome online, horrible offline.","Tribes AA was an awesome online team based competitive game in the early 2000's.I'm not sure if there are any servers for the game anymore, but in it's heyday, T:AA wasa ton of fun.The offline game stinks. It's terrible.The online gaming was fantastic.As a member of one of the most successful online teams in the game Ihad nonstop fun in multiple tournaments and events.<Z:G> ,Zero Gravity, was without a doubt hands down the best fun team in the game.The legendary Phyr with other players like Falco, Bodizafa, and AgentZero....those days were never dull.I have fond memories of this game and the old days."
4,#1 First Person Shooter Ever,"Tribes Arial Assult is one of the Greatest PS2 Games Ever. Metroid Prime and Halo aren't worthy of washing Tribes's draws.Unlike Halo for the Xbox When Playing Tribes Up to four Playstation 2's can not be linked with four players to an Xboxequaling a sixteen player smackdown.Instead One player can play story mode,Two players a death match, Or one or two players can team up on line in an up to sixteen player death match Via network adapters.Metroid Prime ... Compared to this since it is only one player no matter what.Like Halo you can commandear vehicles but in Tribes you can fit Up to 5 players in a Vehicle including yor self.Not only that you can fly and use numerus types of wepons including rochet launchers and machine guns you can even coustomise your own suit.How ever because when online their is no way of communication it gets a four how ever it gets a four of 99.9%"
5,Phucken Krazae,"... This games krazy. tru theres no real way to communicate but with the way this game is even if u could type u wouldnt want to the games too fun and ud prolly die by the time ur done typing. u get to drive bombers, fighters, transports(when they loaded they krazy) perfect amount of weapons, plus 2 can play at 1 PS2. so in final U SHOULD BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!! i bought it for ""a good price"" new, ...for a new awesome game. every1 that reads this, this game is phat and u should buy it its worth more than ""the money you pay for this game"" thats for sure. so go buy it now cause i sure would like more ppl to frag online."
4,Great Value,"I enjoy using this little beast very much. It is what it should be - an on the couch or on the go way to get on the internet. No problems handling very complex web pages or streaming video. I was able to customize Ubuntu to add in the ""OS X"" look and Compiz, which is a multidesktop environment arranged in a cube. It handles the fairly fancy graphics just fine! It is a full blown Linux system, not some crippled version.Keyboard is a little cramped, but hey, it's a 9 in computer! Had the minor issue of the blurry webcam, which was actually the cover being slightly popped out. Pushing it in fixed it.I bought a refurbished one for $249 and don'r regret doing so. Now I am seeing similarly equipped refurbished Acers for $199! Things change in only a month! Great machine, though."
2,Avoid,"Well... I'll just say that I have had better experiences with new computers. I like the form factor and the cool yellow color but Ubuntu is simply a pain in the neck. I can understand that some Linux enthusists might like twiddling with Ubuntu, but I don't. I sent it back and ordered something else. The camera was flaky and wireless is a hassle on any variant of Linux. When I buy a new computer, I want something that works out of the box, not a science project. I ended up going with the Asus Eee with XP - and it is everything I wanted and more. I bought a second Eee for my sister in law and she is equally delighted."
4,This book unmasks the pretensions of compulsory education.,"Paul Goodman has laid it out: school is another racket where people are taught they need the ministrations of the school system. Written in the sixties when it was still fashionable to speak of alienation, Compulsory Miseducation is a bracing reminder that human beings are born free and possess the capacity to shape their own lives outside the institutionalized context of schooling."
1,"nice,I give it 4 stars",This is a nice looking necklace. I haven't worn it enough to feel a difference fom the magnets.If it dosen't lay flat around your neck try wearing it with the stainless steel part of each leaf on the inside of the neclace circle.
3,very good but of course it's dry,"i hate to give it a lower rating, it really is quite good and informative, but to be honest and fair it is quite dry. how can it not be?"
4,Career Bachelor,"I choose to not marry. I myself, like anyone, can CHOOSE to do virtually anything, not just postulate to victim mode that made me not want relationships or make excuses to support the lie why gay is normal or circumstance caused. Lets not play games here. Man + woman is natural. Honored only in marriage. Nothing else works! I've tried the wrong way many times. Happy single and not willing to change. Oh, by the way, as a single person, I can truely say, abstenence is the only thing that works for unmarrieds. Nothing else works! I've tried the wrong way many times. I know in my heart of hearts that this book speaks it straight reguardless of the people who hate the union of couples and slander it by any means. Like the cesspool TV shows and all the supporters of the likes. The author of marriage will heal your wounds of devientcy if you let him."
3,It ok.,The cat flap didnt really work well once i put a bag on it. After trying the box once my cat got stuck in it! So we removed the flap entirely. Its ok but still doesnt hold in the smell very well. My cat got used it to immediately though.Its ok.
5,Cat Box with Roof,I have one of these and love it. It makes it easier for my cat to climb on the sink to get petted or fed. The roof on the cat box provides privacy for your cat and helps with odor control. I would recommend this product for any cat owner.
2,Bad design for big cats,"I have used this cat box for about a year now because I have been unable to find a suitable replacement for my 20 pound cat. What I hate about this box is the design. Specifically how the bottom and lid come together. When my cat pees, the urine gets in-between the seams of the lid and bottom. Urine ends up drying down the sides of the box and in-between the latch mechanisms. I have to strategically place layers of paper towel in between the lid and bottom to help simplify the clean-up process. Cleaning this box is such a pain and it is so time consuming. If you have a regular to small sized cat then perhaps you will not experience this issue. My cat is too large and tall for this box."
5,Best Litter Box Value,"As far as litter boxes go, I think that this one is the best value on the market. I use it for my 20 pound gray tabby, and although it took some time for him to get used to it, I think he likes it as well.First of all, the pan on this box is very deep, which helps a lot in keeping my tabby from tracking litter out of the box. To get an idea of how deep it is, the bottom half is the same height as the top half. So make sure you have plenty of vertical space for this box because it will need it.My one complaint is that my tabby, who is incredibly smart, couldn't figure out how to use the hinged door. Plus, the door is constructed pretty cheaply. I removed it and threw it away, but even without the door, the box itself is a pretty good value. The quality isn't the greatest, but it's only $15. It's about what I expected, and as long as it's not moved around a lot, I expect it to work just fine for the long haul."
4,"excellent box, but...","it seems to be too small for my cats! I have 3 big cats, and they just seem to be cramped in it. height isn't the issue, it's length and width. one gets in and doesn't even turn around, so I am concerned that he'll dump ""it"" all over the floor. and it's not the best at keeping litter contained - they still manage to get litter all over the floor."
2,The Router is Worthless,"This kit simply does not work. The notebook card is fine, but the router is worthless. The router keeps losing its signal when I try to access the internet with my notebook, and shuts itself out of the network. When this happens, I can't even get on the web with the hard-wired PC without rebooting the router. The notebook card works fine, though -- I know this because I can easily use it to pick up the internet from a neighbor's Belkin router, which appears to be much more stable than the lousy Linksys!"
2,Weak signal and crappy setup disk,"Originally I thought this would be a great bundle right off the shelf, but configuring the thing to pick up on my dsl signal was a nightmare. The installation disc is the worst one I have ever experienced and the pdf is practically useless except for the ip address of your router (it is the only way you can configure the darn thing, manually, so if you are a newb to computing, forget it)and the internet port was useless as well. After setting the ips and dns in the router's internal config I just hooked up the modem to one of the normal wired ports (disregarding the manual) and voila!!!Signal strength leaves something to be desired, it is EXTREMELY weak and will sometimes produce horrible lagging (specially for gaming). If you are not gonna be wondering away from the router then this product is right for you, the wireless card bundled works great; otherwise, get something else, trust me, its worth it."
1,DROPS WAY TOO OFTEN - STAY AWAY,"Based on Linksys experience, I decided to buy this network kit for notebooks. They have good products and this was an easy grab off the shelf. Unfortunatley, this is NOT one of them.The connection appears to drop every 20 minutes or less. The connection was great before the router was in place. After I correclty got this thing configured, I noticed connection reliability was below my acceptable levels. Dropped connections non stop through out the day.For the past day I have circumvented the router by going direct to the modem. Not a glitch, perfect connection. The router is the root of the problem, as my desk is only 20ft away from the router and my connection rocks when bypassing the router. This piece is going back asap.If you listen to streaming music, have instant messenger up or use gmail desktop alert for e-mail etc, don't make this mistake.chris (chicago, IL)"
2,Series continues to slide,"In this series, there appears to be an unwelcome correlation the length of the book and the quality of the story. Book 1 was slow at times, but an intersting read. Book 2 was 50 pages longer, but the story was weaker. Book 3 is close to 100 pages longer than book 2 and the story crawls forward. Really, the first 150 pages could have been cut out and plot would have been unaffected.My guess is that women will like this book much more than men. This book is really ""chick lit"" with a science fiction background. It spends great amounts of time on the minutia of relationships at the expense of actually moving the story forward.The author is clearly talented, but this book was just not my cup of tea."
5,Rule#1,This is a must have reading material for an easy answer to figuring out the fundamental data that sometimes seems so confusing at times. It really gave me a better understanding of the whole process and has great examples to also simplify the understanding. I highly recommend this book.
3,15 Minutes???? Please!,"First, let me say that I am not panning this book. It has a lot of good ideas. Cohesiveness of thought may be a little too much to ask. There are 4 points a book like this should make:1) How to find stocks of interest (more focus the better)2) Evaluate the stocks3) Buy price point.4) Sell price point.This book covers only points 2-4.The major failure of this book is that it can't identify what it wants to do. Does it want to give you an idiot proof routine (strategy) for buying stock? Or, does it want to teach you the value of value based investing as taught by Benjamin Graham? Or does it want to be an investment guide? It doesn't do any of those effectively.There are much better guides/strategies out there. There is nothing 15 minutes about this book."
4,Very clear cut,"I'm almost done with the book and I like how specific it is. It gives you everything in a straight forward no BS fashion so there's no second guessing what and how you're supposed to do it. The principles make sense and he runs you step by step through several examples which really helps develop proficiency in executing his methods. Very well written and easy to read. I would give this 5 stars, but I haven't had a chance to see if his methods will make me money."
3,Deceptively Simple Strategy,"The basic idea is to identify a couple of solid stocks and then trade in and out of them as prices swing this way and that way. It is possible to find some companies with solid records and good prospects for continued future growth, BUT things can change. When a stock drops in response to some news, you have to figure out if the market has overreacted and made the stock a temporary bargain, or if the company's fortunes have really changed. That is not easy to do, no matter how well you think you know the company.However, if you are going to try to pick individual stocks, you should probably stick to a handful of stocks that you regularly follow. I am not that sure about the technical analysis being used. The idea is to identify the top or bottom of a huge move, but it seems to me that there could be a lot of little moves, giving you a case of whiplash. It may be better to stay invested, but change the weighting in your portfolio based on valuation."
5,Rule #1,"I fell for this book hook, line & sinker.Phil Town writes with an ability that few have.He is able to convey a sense of feeling. That the technique he teaches in the book is really what he uses to invest.He is honest enought to admit he does veer from the Rule #1 technique but his experience allows him that privilige.For a new investor like myself he reiterates that I should hold fast to his teachings to make money until my own experience allows me some lattitude.I will make money with this technique and I won't blame Phil if I stuff it up by getting cocky or being scared to do as he says.I've read some other stuff but nothing like this."
5,Well written and full of useful insight for the average would be shareholder.,"It's written for the average ""been thinking about buying stocks but it's too overwhelming"" person which is the main reason I enjoyed reading it the first time. I say this because it is the type of book that you read more than once and parts of it several times. I recommend it for anyone who has thought about investing but could you use a bit of hand-holding along side solid advice."
3,"Great idea, poor writting style","The whole idea of picking stocks is great, though I have not use the rule to make money yet.However, the book has 330 pages, most of the contents are just page fillers. The author should be able to strip down to a 30 pages book and make the it even easier to read."
5,Good condition,The book arrived just in time for my classes. It was used but in great condition. No writings or dog ears within the book. Paper back and a good size to take to work as well.
4,Quiet and magical - not unlike falling snow,"I sought out this book to buy after getting it from our local library for my 19-month-old daughter. At first, it seemed like a snoozer as I paged through it at the library, but I added it to our pile anyway. It seemed timely, if nothing else since it was winter here. My daughter surprised me later when we opened it at home. Before I began reading, she pointed furiously at the pictures. ""Boots!"" She said as she identified the little girl's snow gear. Same with her scarf and snowsuit. She then proceeded to imitate the pictures pretending to catch snowflakes on her eyes, her hand and her tongue, saying ""yum, yum"" along as I read. She even learned how to make a snow angel from the illustration. When we were done, I often got her little ""again"" to go back to the beginning. So, I was wrong. It was a hit. A very soft-spoken, gentle rhyme and picture book that captures the magic of falling snow for toddlers."
3,"Stacey,Stacey,Stacey....","Oh God Stacey! I hate you! All the boy's like you. You are so lucky! Yea right! At least I don't have 5 ex-boyfriends coming to town all on the same day! It's a cool book but it kinda seems unrealistic because,well,I just don't think all of your ex-boyfriends coming to your town all on the same day.Her ex-bf's:Jeremy- broke up with her beacause he started to have new feelings for Cluad...Ethan- Stace broke up with a few days before she went out with JeremyToby- guy she and Mary Anne met at Sea City. First kiss was with him. He broke up with her because she was getting too serious.Robert- were together for a long time.Sam-Kristy's older bro.Talked about math alot on dates."
2,Stacey+ Too Many Guys= A Bad Book!,"I didn't find this book interesting because all it talks about is Stacey and guys. This series never even talks about the Baby-Sitters Club anymore.I didn't get my moneys worth. In the story, Stacey's ex- boyfriends all come to see Stacey in Stoneybrook. The five of them all colide at this big party.It's the most dullest book I've read in my life. I agree with the person below me. DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"
2,XEROX THIS !,"Being from St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, I hear a lot of southern LA rappers. I love Master P and Mystikal and I think the group drama is imitating the dirty south artists. Big as Atlanta is you would think they would have some originality. I'm not hating on Georgia rappers, because I do like Ghetto Mafia. Nice beat, my preschool kids love it. I am a Master P fan and at the same time, I don't want to knock a young black group, but they need more authenticity and originality. Best of luck to the group on their next track."
3,Nice but won't work,"This is a very nice cat pan. However, unless you own small cats this probably won't work. My cats are the size of small dogs and they wouldn't have much room for movement once inside."
2,Very small litter box....not large at all!,"This litter box is SMALL--not large as advertised.....ok for a tiny cat, but any medium to large cat would barely fit in it and not be able to easily move around. It's also very narrow. I guess you get what you pay for....."
5,Otto finds himself fighting the forces who would end magic,"In Charlotte Haptie's Otto And The Flying Twins, humans have changed the magic world of the City of Trees and taken away its magic: magical folk must hide as a result. Otto has no magic in him and needn't worry; but when his twin sisters begin to fly, their family lives change. Suddenly Otto finds himself fighting the forces who would squelch magic in the world in this unusual story."
1,Nothing spectacular,"Typical compliation fare. Nothing to go run out and get (unless you are an avid ""got-to-have-everything-she-puts-out"" Madonna fan). If you are a casual listener of Madonna (like me), then I'd recommend just dubbing her songs of the radio or borrowing it from a friend. Also, on another note, why did Madonna have the audacity to remake a classic? She is on one with that. Just for butchering a classic, I give her one star. Shame, shame Madonna."
4,Suprise,"This isn't really my kind of music, but I really liked this CD. I bought it for Madonna and Moby and was pleasantly surprised. It's a pretty good mix of stuff. The only thing I skip is Christina AugaWhatever and that track isn't even too bad for her."
3,Not too thrilling.,"I like corn, peas, and carrots, but don't think tomato goes so well with this. Tomato has too strong of a tast to put with other ingridiants. I like the heat in it, but it would be better if it has less heat.Over all, healthy snack, but kind of feels like eating uncooked vegi from an instant noodle cup.. which could be true."
5,Excellent powerfull fan,"I just picked up this fan today from Costco. Last summer these sold out so quick I wanted to make sure I got one so I bought early.I knew this fan would be loud when I bought it. I don't think from the picture on the box Patton expects this to be used as a bedroom fan. It's more a high powered fan for a work area. It's really not as bad as I expected though. The lower setting has plenty of power if you need to use it in the bedroom.I plan on either putting this outside on the balcony to blow cool air into the house or to use as an exaust fan in the opposite side of the house so noise won't be a problem.The fan is solid, well made, all metal except for the blade. I was very pleased when I got it home and tried it out. This fan can really move alot of air. It sends a massive solid coluum of air deep into the room."
1,Bad deal,"I have known Dr. Andrew Weil personally and he will not be any happy if he reads this review. I purchased Weil Daily Multivitamins for Optimal Health, 180 tablets on Oct.7 from Amazon (vendor Team Nutrix,LLC) today Oct.23 I received an opened container - looking like it was used by someone living in the streets- with an opened seal and visibly missing tablets. I promptly put it back with protective gloves and don't want nothing again from that source, wondering how Amazon screen its vendors. If I don't have a refund and some kind of compensation my lawyer will be taking the case promptly. Have seen on the Internet other similar complains against ""Team Nutrix"" wish I had know better beforeBraulioNewport Beach, California"
3,Not the same as the formula sold on Dr. Weil's website,"I'm a huge fan of Dr. Weil and his supplement recommendations. At different times, I've subscribed to the Dr. Weil Vitamin Advisor program, but I found that I could get the supplements through Amazon for less money (and free shipping), so I decided to go that route. However, when I received this item, I realized that it wasn't the same as the formula sold through Dr. Weil's website. The formula you buy from Dr. Weil directly is two multivitamin tablets per day, not one, which means that it's much easier to swallow--it's about half the size of this pill. In addition, this standalone bottle has less Vitamin D (only 400 IU instead of 2,000 IU), less Vitamin B12 (only 50 mcg instead of 100 mcg), and a variety of other differences. If you don't find these differences (or the pill size) a problem, then I do recommend this product."
3,"stinky, big, and make your pee radioactive yellow","I started taking these about a week ago, and my urine immediately turned fluorescent yellow. I've done some research and found out it's from the excess B vitamins. It's not harmful, but it's there. But the worst thing about these pills is that they REALLY smell like vitamins. I dread taking them due to the smell and intensely vitaminy taste, which lingers in my nose and mouth even after I swallow the pill. Burping after a vitamin is about as pleasant as sniffing a fart. And the vitamins are also very large, which doesn't bother me particularly, but I'm just stating the facts. I'm not sure if they're doing me any good at all, but since I bought them, I will continue to take them. I don't hate them, but I doubt I'll buy this brand next time. Which will be in about a year since I bought a whole stockpile from Amazon because they were discounted. Oh well!"
1,STORM OF MONEY OUT THE WINDOW,"once again a great cover misleads into purchasing an awful movie.the dead?plural?there is actualy one un-dead voodoo animated guy that the entire movie was howling behind bushes that comes out on the 50th minute of the film!another fun day in the fields with the friends of the director and his fat topless girlfriend to up the stakes a bit!some movies should be sold for 1 dollar,or with free beer maybe?then it would be fun to watch,and not feel sorry for the money you gave?at least pay for the beers?"
1,Happy ??? Birthday,What is this movie trying to prove? That same-sex attractions and attraction ultimately lead to disaster? What an incredibly depressing movie.
1,Antigay propaganda,"Was sex inappropriate between the older and younger man? Yes, in this instance he was cheating on his wife. However this movie portrays the young man as a protagonist about be ""sodomized"" by an older man. You see the subtle forewarning by David's uncle who witnessed Mateo's ministrations towards a younger David and the suspicious looks of his mother. It is all obvious and practiced leading to a portrayal of a ""homosexual as predator"" towards the young. It is an Italian film however and one must not be too expectant of positive gay role models in films from a country steeped for centuries in Catholicism. Need I mention the acting was amateurish?"
4,Good in quality.. but not in size,"The product is very good.. good for the price... nice finish... but if you are really concerned with the size, this one is not the best...holds only 2 cups...."
2,Fair,"This is not the Rare Earth you are used to. The band who brought you ""I Just Want To Celebrate,"" and a killer version of the Temptations ""I'm Losing You,"" came back at some point in the 1980s.And 1980s this is: the singer still maintains his soulful shout, but in service of glossy pop soul--that's 90% pop, as in MOR--and a little disco.If your a fan get it, but your on your owm."
2,Would be pretty good but the TYPOS!!!,"It seems that this book was very well thought out. It also could really be a good book for a person who has had some shell scripting experience, however, the typos are tremendous. A person who has some shell scripting experience will be able to see the mistakes in this book, but a true beginner to shell scripting should stay away from this book, because the typos will confuse you, like they did me. Thank goodness I sought another Unix book and got the correct answers. I was so angry with the typos in this book that I emailed the author, however, I didn't get a response. The only good thing that came out of this experience is that I never buy a book unless it's at a minimum ""SECOND EDITION"", so that hopefully the typos are cleared up from the FIRST EDITION. If you're brand new to shell scripting, stay away from this book."
5,One of the best compilations,"This is one of the best compilations of Vilma Palma so far. This is kind of a latin mix of metal and classic rock, nicely created and performed by the argentinian band from Rosario, Santa F√©.If you like strong rock beats, this is the choice in latin rock."
5,NICE LESS EXPENSIVE OVERVIEW,"This is one of the larger German Connie Francis CD sets. It's a good intro to her complete output in the language available on a 5 CD box set Lass Mir Bunten Traume (Let Me Paint Dreams). The only song not on this massive set is the gold record JIVE CONNIE where they have taken her German hits and overlaid a hard techno beat that drove it to the top of the European charts.Much of the material are songs written for Connie by German composers. Those familiar with her hits, will also find some Wenn Ich Traume (When I Dream) or Where The Boys are here as well.You don't have to speak the language (which I do) to enjoy these songs. They are melodious and catchy. Connie powerhouse vocals sells every tune in this collection.A very nice compilation from an extremely versatile songstress (who sang in 9 languages).Well done!"
2,not really that good house,"it's too repetative. my main gripe with it, and the remixes of many of the tracks that are on here aren't as good as the originals frankly. a good example of this is with the track coffee talk - the version on the budda bar II album is much better. it just seemed not really able to all gel together nicely as you go from one track to the next. i am a picky person though when it come to house or deep house since i have over 3000 tracks. but anyway, pick it up used if you want, but otherwise, i'd go pick up some cd's by the actual artists on here, like the funky lowlives, or tosca. you'd be better off."
1,Does not work,"This does not work for what I wanted it for. I guess it doesn't put out enough power. I have a small wet dry vac for my car, that I wanted to use in my house. So i thought I could buy this to use it with. But it does not work at al. Not sure if other things work with it or not. that's the only thing I wanted it for. Very disappointing :-/"
4,Non-Fiction,"Very informative, and a lot of fun.Much as in the first volume, along with brief episode descriptions and information there is a whole lot more fun stuff to be found in this look at the third and fourth seasons of the show.Informations on the various quips and references made by the characters, and also some quotable quotes will come in handy for fans, no doubt about it.Plenty of other bits and pieces following the characters and their relationships.Good stuff."
5,best buffy guide around!,"this is a very good guide.Not only episode guides but character guides,cast interviews,new pics and cast quotes.This is fantastic filled to the brim with buff stuff even better than the watchersguide vol.1 up to date epispde guide season 3-season 4.A must for every buffy fan. 5 stars!!!!!"
5,You won't need any other saucepan,"I use this pan for an endless variety of recipes. It serves as a skillet as well as a cocotte, and it has almost non-stick properties that are hard to come by on anything other than a perfectly cured cast iron utensil, which is susceptible to degradation if used with acidic or sugary foods."
5,Very important work,"Mussorgsky was born in 1839.In 1863 ( 24 years old) he began to work in a opera based in a text of Flaubert : Salammbo.As always he wrote the libretto . Unfortunately he didn't complete the score. He used some material in Boris Godunov , and he orchestrated only one part of the music he composed.Zoltan Pesko did a very good job writing one edition of the work, and he recorded it in Italy in 1980. This CD is a rarity . I found it in Milan in 2005. If the orchestra isn't one first rate ensemble, the soloists are in general very good. I must say that Shemchuk portrays a fantastic Salammbo .But lets speak of the music. It 's impressionable that one young man could write a music like that, so consistent and so beautiful. I really think that Mussorgsky was the greatest genius of the Russian composers of his century . And he was so modern for his time that everyone changed what he wrote.I would say Thank You for Zoltan Pesko. Because of him I discovered one impressionable work."
5,Larry Carlton's Master Fingerprints,"It's amazing how a real ""Music Master"" like Larry could get even better with time and ""Fingerprints"" is a good signal about that. His ability to compose and his performance on guitar has shown again, why he is considered one of the best jazz players actually. All the tracks are pretty good but I must say that ""Crying Hands"" is out of reality and discovers Larry's sensibility to express something deep and untouchably beautiful. There is also a great surprise when hearing Michael McDonald voice on one track. This is an album to hear hundred times and you'll never get bored of it...."
4,Excellent,"I have been a great fan of LC since the mid 70's and this CD is really excellent. LC's CDs of the mid 80's and 90's were OK but not great. This one is a true return to form and specially much more mature.Tracks like Fingerprints, All thru night, if everyday were Christmas are brilliant. LC is a cut above the other Smooth Jazz artits"
3,An OK album from a jazzier Carlton,"I was excited to see Larry came out with a new album. Well, I put this in my cd player and gave it a listen. The first tune is cool, it has a nice beat. As I listened to the rest of the cd, I noticed Larry has gotten jazzier over the years. It isn't bad, but it's not as good as the Carlton I've grown to know and love.Fingerprints isn't nearly as good as Renegade Gentleman or On Solid Ground, which is a little dissapointing. Larry and Lee was good, so I figured this album would be good as well. After a few listens I've concluded that this album is just OK. Not bad, but not great either. I await his next release."
4,Done With a Distinct Market in Mind,"I've been a Carlton fan since his days with the Crusaders. The guy is absolutely a consummate musician, composer, arranger and guitarist. Unfortunately, for an individual of his abilities, everything he does begs comparison with the prior body of work he has created. Fingerprints seems to have been geared directly to the smooth jazz market and consequently little of his brilliance is in evidence here. That said, anything of Carlton's is well worth hearing. If you like this one, you might want to investigate some of his great work on discs such as ""Strikes Twice"", ""Sleepwalk"", and ""Friends"". His work with Ritenour is pretty good as well. If you prefer the smooth stuff, check out Ronny Jordan and Joyce Cooling. Cooling caters to the smooth jazz sound - but she does it superbly!"
4,Seems to be No Middle Ground,"I was amazed to see the difference of opinion on this title by Hoagland. Having read the book all the way through (unlike some who haven't read it at all, or only a hundred or so pages) I found it to be interesting, though provoking and certainly worth the dollars I paid for it. There are some naysayers who call it pseudo-science, others who call it conspiracy theory, and yet others just plain drivel. There are people who believe it as gospel, some who think Hoagland can do no wrong, and some that think his science is impeccable. As for me -- I found it to be more on the resonable side of scientific debate, a good argument for a hypothesis. Is the face really there? Most of us may never know in our lifetimes for whatever reasons, but this book certainly gives you something to think about."
1,Absolute drivel!,"I waited until Mars Global Surveyor had returned high-resolution images of this area of the planet Mars before I turned to this book, and I can say in all honesty that it is a very long time indeed since I came across such absolute drivel. It isn't just the 'face', it's all the structures which he imagines to be around its location, building it up into some sort of metropolis, that is so stupid. If you want a laugh, go buy it. If you want to find out about Mars, buy something else.David Harland"
2,A Classic Example of the Danger of Post-hoc Explanations,"An interesting sci-fi book, but for anyone who finds Hoagland's post-hoc explanations persuasive, I strongly recommend R. Gary Patterson's ""The Walrus Was Paul : The Great Beatle Death Clues"". Each provides a great example of how very compelling arguments and patterns can be found in random data, when one looks hard enough. As the quote from Sagan on the back cover of Hoagland's book stated, the Face on Mars was within the realm of science. However, since the re-imaging failed to confirm a face, Hoagland now insists the images were doctored. Since there is no evidence that could potentially disconfirm his theories that he could not explain away in this manner, he has moved the face issue out of the realm of science into an issue of faith. Psychoanalytic theory suffered a similar fate. It does not mean that he is wrong, but it does mean his assertions can no longer be categorized under the rubric of the scientific method."
4,Worthwhile reading experience,"The critics who condemn Hoagland's work should be aware that there wasn't just one 'face' on the red planet, but apparently several that were discovered by the Viking craft. If one familiarizes themselves with pharaohic Egypt, they will be find a stunning connection with Mars and Egypt."
4,A Definite Page Turner,"I bought this book not knowing what to expect. Now I know Nora Roberts is an author I will definitely look forward to. The Three Fates is a great action, adventure, romance, thriller all in one. Nora Roberts weaves a web of 4 intimate stories into one that leaves the reader so engrossed the novel that you're sometimes tempted to read to quickly or read ahead just to find out what happens next. I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that near the end I think the romance story was too predictable."
3,Quality is not so good.,"I love the features of this product, but the quality is something to be desired. The Mac people love to talk about the PC's ""Blue Screen of Death"", well, this Apple product has the ""Black Apple of Death"". It freezes and locks on a regular basis. If you are lucky, it only seizes for a few minutes and then resets. If it is not your lucky day, it will freeze completely and be completely useless until the battery dies and it can be recharged. I have the same complaint as everyone else, too, it was marred and scratched with hours of purchase. I'm sorry I bought this product. I love having an mp3 player that plays video, but I should've bought a different brand. Thankfully, there are many 3rd party companies that make accessories, because Apple charges a whole lot of money for every little thing."
3,My new 60GB ipot,"After I used my new ipot for a month my feeling is....not uesr friendly as I though. My personal feeling is it should be easy to load my MP3 into my ipot without any software, but it costs many confuse (may be I'm too old)I cannot transfer my video to my ipot and I have to search any available software to tranfer my video file to my ipot. Some software doesn't work fine and i-tune isn't transfer file too."
2,Having Problems!,"When trying to download information to the Ipod, I keep getting error messages reading Ipod is corrupt and it asks me to restore the Ipod. Sometimes the software will recognize the Ipod and other times it won't. I have installed and reinstalled the software several times, but it does not seem to fix the problem."
5,""" I can't hear you""",My wife hasn't listened to me in 18 years. Now she has her gourd plugged into this mini-marvel 24/7. My self esteem has been kicked up a notch. Thanks Steve!
4,Works fine for m,These have worked as advertised for me so far. I use them to help avoid gout from toes rubbing togethr. They are very comfortable
3,Not what it seems,"Although it feels quite soft and comfortable, it's the packaging that is not so good, in the picture seems to come in a nice box in wich you would even think there are instructions or at least details... Well, in came inside a plastic, white little plastic sleve. But guess you get what you pay for."
3,Not very good,They do not hold too well. They fall out of place easily. I think it is overpriced and I will not buy it again
3,soft and comfortable,"These are effective, but the material is pliable and doesn't hold its shape, so I don't expect them to last very long."
2,Why These?,"When I saw a new Charlie Chan cover illustration, I thought: At last! The remaining unreleased Chan films are finally out...but no, it's just a reissue of things already available. Where are THE RED DRAGON, SHADOWS OVER CHINATOWN, THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS, THE SHANGHAI CHEST, THE GOLDEN EYE, THE FEATHERED SERPENT and THE SKY DRAGON? When they turn up, I'll buy them. But I've already got everything that's been released."
4,"Good introduction, but some shortcomings","Basically, I liked this book and found that it covered all the essential points anyone would want to know. However, in places I thought it was redundant and could have gone deeper.While there are several books on this topic, this is one of the most accesible to Westerners. I also think Sharon Salzberg's sincerity and belief in what she is doing comes through.If you don't own any resources on Metta meditation, this is a good place to start."
5,Card table review,"This card table is very sturdy. The legs are solidly locked in place, both when extended and when stored. The top appears to be durable. Overall, this appears to be a quality product."
2,So So,"You need a strng person around as It is extremely heavy, very hard to fold legs, one leg is crooked, and the top is unattractive"
4,Good pedal,Pedal as advertised it was for my son. He loves the pedal it does exactly what he wanted best price plus free tshirt
3,"Its ok, there are more durable, and more entertaining toys for the money.","Pros:Dogs like itUniqueStays functional even after breachCons:Really not that durable (stuffing was leaking within the week.)A little awkward to play with.Protip for dog toys: Go to the fabric store, get some cheap fleece (3$/yard or so) tie into knots, braids, whatever. Get creative. Give em to the dogs. Enjoy."
1,aggressive dog chewers,I really thought the item was not manufactured for the aggressive chewing dog. i bought the product and 5 minutes after i gave it to my dog it was all chewed up. i think the name of durability was a little miss leading.
1,"Not tough, not durable",My 1 year old VIzsla shredded this toy in less than 45 minutes. Definetlly not a durable toy for active chewers
1,Makes a mess and horrible for Basmati rice.,"I was very disappointed with this cooker. I bought it solely to cook Basmati rice for Indian food. The instructions are confusing because it has you measure with their little cup but then you're supposed to fill the water to one of the lines in the pan, depending on how much you want to make. That and the wording is just very poor. A small, at a glance chart would be helpful instead of having to dig through the booklet to find that one paragraph.You can only cook about 2 cups cooked rice in it if you don't want a mess on your hands. Anything over that boils over onto the counter. The lid is loose and does not fit securely. And by time it's done, the rice at the bottom is burnt, and the rice itself is nowhere near as nice as you can make on the stove. I've used it 8 times and have yet to come up with a successful batch of rice. I'm done and going for a higher priced, but hopefully better quality cooker."
1,This blows!!!!!!,"Got it at walmart, used it one time rice was good went to use a second time and it just stopped working."
2,Loved it until . . . .,"I loved this rice cooker, and used it weekly for 4 months, until it just stopped working. Surely the life span should not be only 4 months."
2,Not worth the money,"After only about 6 months of use (maybe 10 to 15 uses) my cooker is dead. I'm on the hunt for something a bit more reliable. This cooker may be inexpensive, and it did a decent job when it did work, but it should have lasted longer. Like another reviewer pointed out, this cooker actually boils the rice, and steam and water bubble out of the small vent hole in the lid. Not that big of a deal, but I always had to place a paper towel on the counter to keep it clean."
5,Cuban cooking at its best,I read most of the book and it had a lot of interesting historical stories. The family names mentioned in the book were known by my Mom to be people of means and position in Cuba judging from all the places they described in the book. I tried a few recipes and came out delicious especially the black bean soup recipe. This is a very good compilation of the most popular Cuban dishes and would definitely recommend buying this book. The rice pudding recipe was good but my Mom's is better and I added a few things to it. It is still a very good basic recipe.
2,Plastic too stiff,I loved the looks of these... until i put them on my feet.The plastic was too stiff and they weren't comfortable at all.I returned them.
3,Narrow and small,"These shoes seemed that they may be comfortable for someone with very narrow feet. They also run about a size too small. I have always taken a 7 1/2 in sandals. I ordered an 8 and they were way too small. There is also not much room for your foot because the band runs too close to the shoe. Very, very tight fit. I'm afraid to order a size up because the length is not the only problem. I am also having trouble with Amazon's return. I can never get the page to open so that I can schedule the return online. going to keep trying, though."
3,Well written historical revisionism,"But, then again, isn't that true of anything that the Orthodox write about Catholicism?The Orthodox Church was formed in the midst of the politics of late antiquity when the Greeks failed to recognize the position of the Bishop of Rome as Pope of the entire church. Period.One interested in the truth of the matter is better served by reading Stephen Ray's ""Upon this Rock"""
4,"Good quality, but a bit wider than you might expect","They never show side pictures of these type of knives because they are surprisingly wide. This may dissuade you from carrying it in your pocket. But, it's better than carrying a separate pen knife and nail clipper.Nail clippers are not as good/easy to use as a cheap pair of dedicated clippers, but, again, you get the multi use."
4,Nice,"Tarkan is a bit like Ricky Martin in my opinion. The songs are very catchy and all about love, love, love. I liked this CD so much that I have two other CDs from Tarkan as well."
5,Great CD,Tarkan is great- i heard Shikidim- the kiss song- one day and i knew that this was totally for me--i listen to the copy of the CD i have all the time- and i love it to death
4,Dance it !,If you need motivational music to get up and dance.. this is it! Simarik <or kiss kiss called by my class mates> is a shimmy must.
3,Great until you drop it,"I dropped the unit when checking a tire's pressure (~6 inches off the ground) and the unit immediately stopped working. Dropping any precision instrument can't be good for it, but the fall wasn't all that high or hard and I thought it should have been able to handle it. It's an inexpensive unit and it seemed to work fine before the fall, so I'll most likely purchase another to replace it and be a little more careful next time."
2,Dorman Exhaust Manifold 674-201,I recently purchased this manifold along with Dorman 674-199 thinking that I would get a pair with similiar appearance. That did not happen. They look like apples and oranges. The 674-199 was acceptable and quite similiar to the OEM style but the 674-201 was not close. What I got looked like it had been repackaged by someone else that had sent it back as unacceptable. I decided to keep the manifold and not go through the hassle of the return. At some point I will discard this manifold when I locate a match to the 674-199.
4,Dark Serendipity,"This movie never made the mainstream. I had never heard of it. But I love Goldblum and Alan Bates si I gave it a shot. I can't tell you how utterly amazed I was. It was funny, gruesome, chilling, well directed and totally captivating. They really portrayed Kathy Baker's character as a logic only shrink very well. However with all of her knowledge and experience she couldn't resist what she was feeling. A must see. Definately!"
4,Holy Cow!!,"Wow, this company, ""Adventers' Bag"" is charging outrageous prices for their items. The MSRP on this little plastic funnel is $5.99......"
4,Great sibling gift,"While this particular order did not arrive (lost in the mail apparently), I bought it because we already own a copy and I knew it would be a great gift for a new big brother. The book is a story about an older sibling who keeps asking the parents questions about where the baby came from and whether they can send it back. Of course at the end he realizes he loves the baby. It's not deep, but the rhyming text interests preschoolers and will provide some giggles. There is a little bit of potty humor ""Did you build it from a kit? All it can do is pee and poo is there a missing bit?"" but if the parents are relaxed about it, a four year old will find it hysterical. The pictures are adorable and the text is hilarious from an adults perspective. It's as much a gift for the new parents as for the child."
2,Beware if you have USB1.1,"This dvd drive is not compatible with USB1.1. I bought this in Officedepot for a good deal. The drive looked really nice with black/silver colorings. The stand is sturdy and can keep your drive vertically without any risk of falling.But after I bought this, I plugged it into my computer. I was really shocked with the performance as it read some dvd movies horribly which were properly read by my other dvd-rom drive (internal). I tested it by writing 1 GB of data into a DVD-R disc. It claims a complete DVD-R write(4.5 GB) would take only 6 minutes. But I had to wait for around 1/2 hr for the 1 GB to get written into the disc. It was damn slow. It's 1x not 16x. Then I started reading the manual and found it will work at 1x or sometimes won't work with USB1.1. Luckily, I returned it and got my money back.I dont know whether it is good for USB2.0, but I am sure it is not for people having only USB1.1; I am going now for an internal dvd-rw drive."
1,Not good quality,"I was expecting a good quality tea kettle. Instead I received a cheap, light weight ""tingy"" kettle. I am returning this one and will order a much heavier, better quality kettle."
5,Brews great,I bought this to brew my iced tea. It is very easy to maneuver and takes no time to brew.
3,ok product. Not easy to use,"The handle is not movable. So when you try to add water into it, it is not that convenient.For the price, it is ok."
3,phil,"Good kettle for the money. Since, all your doing is boiling water. It is a bit flimsy but okay for occasional use."
5,Nice lunch box,This is a really nice lunch box. Durable and the colors are nice. Our child really likes the horses on it.
1,substandard dvd,"In buying and reading 'A Wilderness of Error' by Errol Morris, I was intrigued by The Thin Blue and ordered the DVD.It was exceptionally boring, taped video interview after taped video interview that we tried to get through twice but finally gave up and will toss. It was a big waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone. The jacket made it seem like an exciting thriller but it definitely was not."
4,A good stretch.,"All you need is a floor and towel. Everything can be easily modified for people with injuries and the stretch is real, despite the odd name. The cover looks low-budget, but the video is better than that. More importantly, the content is worth it."
3,aluminum AND plastic,"This pepper grinder is (...) cheaper than others which look like it, but-1. the bottom plate (on which is mounted the grinding mechanism) is white plastic2. the grinding mechanism itself, while adjustable, is not very good in very coarse mode.I was surprised that it was so cheap. Of course, I found out when it arrived that the old ""you get what you pay for"" is still true. I don't know how long it will last since I have only had it for a fortnight. Still, it's not bad - namely, the outer shell (that can be seen) is metal, the handle and ther adjustment are reasonably convenient, and the side filling mechanism is great. On the other hand, the plastic bottom plate (hidden under the outer shell' skirt) is cheasy and the mechanism looks doubtful to me. All in all, it still seems to be a reasonably good deal (...).If, however, you are loooking for the real thing - i.e. full metal with a high-end mechanism - then don't buy this one.Best,camisdad"
1,Product is not as described,"I ordered this product because I need a headset with a sound card plug connection. This product looks great and perfect for my use. However, the item does NOT have a sound card connection and the seller (not Amazon) will NOT take the item back if you open the package.I cannot comment on the quality of the item as I cannot use it."
1,Disappointing,"I'm reading a bio of each President and was actually excited to get to Hoover. I figured he couldn't be nearly as bad as his reputation and there might be some insight as to how he was so successful in most of his life, but failed so miserably as president. Alas, there is not. The book seems well-researched, but there is a stunning lack of personal detail. Almost nothing other than Hoover's offical writings are cited. No anecdotes from friends. No personal correspondance. Before he went into government, he spent most of his adult life overseas. Surely there would be some interesting tales from those adventures, I thought. None. If you have to do research on Hoover, I suppose this is a fine place to start. However, if you're a bio fan and looking for some insight into the man and the times, don't bother. To be fair, such a book may not exist or even be feasible with Hoover. This one definitely isn't it."
4,Good book,"Great book, really helps with tapping and working on your Chi and Chakras - highly recommended for anyone looking for some self-help."
4,Extremely useful,This book is accessible and well written and I found it extremely useful in making sense of a myriad of feelings and emotions that I've experienced in the past. Recommended reading
3,Another Doo Wop CD Makes Its Rounds.,"I bought this CD for one song, A Penny For Your Thoughts by Bruce Clark and the Q's. I never thought I'd ever hear it again and even though it's an alternate take I still love it.There are some good songs here; 3 that charted in the top 10 and a couple more that were in the top 40. Another song, I Worship The Ground You Walk On by Walter Rhodes, which I had never heard of until now, is great. But by and large most of the songs are just OK. However, it is an early look at Rock 'n Roll and I'm glad I bought it."
4,A very comforting read,"I had never paid much attention to Peg Bracken even though my mother had all her books and some of her recipes are family staples. I found this one when sorting out a bunch of books to donate and something made me sit down and read it. I now want to find copies for all my friends. Some of the receipes and humor are dated, but this book is like curling up with a cup of coffee and a hot muffin on a rainy day. I love it!"
1,Poor quality,I bought two of this item. One turned into a yucky purple/black color after a couple of uses. The other broke after about half a year.I don't recommend it to anyone.
4,real brothers,real brothers who really ride who love and need Gods great salvation. all you who are burdened come unto to me and i will give you rest.who ever says they have not sinned are saying Gods a lier. Lord come quickly.
3,Not that great,"There are some - too many - very tasteless recipes in this book. It also has a few too many recipes that have fruits that some people cant tolerate on this anti yeast diet. I asked someone who already had this book to tell me the recipes that she thought were good, and she only named 5 or 6. I recommend signing this book out from your local library if possible and trying recipes or looking for ones that may appeal to you instead of spending money on the book."
4,Shattered are the Dreams of mankind,"When we first lived in the wide lands of the World, and men and beast alike dreamt of what had been, and what would come, and the masters ruled in justice all, the Dreaming was alive and fluid, and the Glamour was plenty. But then came the time when men became many, and they forsook their dreams, and we perished. Those of us that were left here are in the book, and long are our lives, and even longer our stories. May the day come that men dream again, and we shall walk the ancient trods once more. May the gates to Arcadia open once again, and we shall live in peace."
3,"Handy, but bad cutting surface","I really like the basic design of this board, perfect for my pre-renovation kitchen; but the cutting surface itself is pretty crummy. Granted, it doesn't dull the knives; but it's easily cut itself, not self healing. So now there are gashes all over the surface that collect whatever. Maybe I'm paranoid and don't know enough about polypropylene, but I have visions of bacterial colonies flourishing.Also, I like the little basket, very handy for transferring to pan and/or garbage; but it does make it somewhat difficult to store."
5,As good as they say it is!,"This product has been one of the most beneficial products in my kitchen. It is adjustable to the size of the sink, has a handy side draining tray, AND the surface of the board really doesn't scratch! The best one of its kind on the market."
3,Doesn't quite work,"This is an good idea, and it would be perfect if it actually worked well. My kitchen is tiny, so added work space is always good, and it is convenient to be able to easily rinse off the cutting board between uses. However, since my sink has rounded porcelain edges, and the legs need to be fully extended to fit, the assembly is often unstable, especially when the rubber feet are wet (for some reason, this happens relatively often around the sink). When chopping vegetables with any sort of enthusiasm, the whole apparatus is constantly at risk of being dumped into the sink."
5,#1! Fabulous third book by author Debby DuBay!,"Collecting Hand Painted Limoges Porcelain Boxes to Vases by Debby DuBay, Foreword by Erika Kotite, ed., Victorian Homes and Introduction by Mary Frank Gaston is FABULOUS! Found this book at www.collectinglimoges.com and now I see it is available here. With so many books on the subject on the market - I was thrilled that Ms DuBay came up with a new approach to the subject; the process of hand painted and the women during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries and their contributions to the subject. WONDERFUL for collectors of hand painted porcelain! Once again, in the Debby DuBay style, there are fabulous colored photographs of collectors homes and pieces from boxes to vases with complete descriptions and values/price guide to over 1000 pieces. You will want this book in your library!"
5,Jasper's Day,"This story is a wonderful story about preparing to say good-bye to the family pet. Having just lost a pet of my own, I cried the whole time through, and I wish I had spent my last day with her as meaningfully as the family in the story. I would recommend this to any family with an older or sick pet."
5,Couldn't ask for a better debut,"The Deadlights show they can do a little bit of everything and do it well. Their music ranges from nu-metal heaviness to mellow acoustic work. A lot of people compare this band to Coal Chamber, and on a few tracks I hear the resemblance; but, overall, I think The Deadlights have much more to offer than their counterparts. The song writing heard here is far beyond anything CC has ever done. Get out there and buy this one."
4,Seasons short,I like the series but the season is too short and I hate having to buy it in 2 stages. Barry Fitzgerald is great as head of this group. I like seeing the locations and hearing some history.
4,Hatichi C7BMR Circular Saw,"Nice solid, sort of heavy, feeling circular 7 1/4 saw. Came with good carbide tipped blade. Runs smooth, cuts straight, heavy base feels very substantial. Blade brake doesn't stop the blade rotation very fast - it still rotates for 10 -15 seconds after releasing the trigger. There is no safety button required to activate the start-up. Sort of nice for experienced users, but may be missed by those new or infrequent electric ciruclar saw users."
5,One of best saws made today.,We test tools every day. This one is a winner and highly recommended to be used with the ez tracksaw system.You can buy it from Amazon and ship direct to eurekazone for tracksaw and dust collection modifications.
3,Difficult to rate....,"I was very disappointed with Amazon on this one. The unit I received was clearly used. Worse, the shoe was slightly bent, and it seems that the motor was loose in the casing. The feel of the saw was also disappointing though. I chose this, and a Milwaukee 6390-21, and the Mil was clearly superior in feel. Unfortunately, I can't rate its (Hitachi) operation because I returned it and kept the Milwaukee.I tried not to mention this, but the mint green color was almost toy-like. The old industrial green that they used previously was much better."
4,The Chevy of Joysticks,"""Like a Rock"". Accurate, hefty, and stable its a joystick that won't feel like its going to break the next time you decide to hit the deck. Button placement may not be optimal for everyone, but what joystick is? With its heavy base it can double for a personal defense weapon. The cool thing about it is that you just plug it into your USB port and you are ready for action. It is very precise in its movement/cursor relationship. You don't get the ""wobble"" you have with sticks plugged into joystick ports when you check it on setup. The top hat is one of the best working of any stick I have used. I got through lots of joysticks, Side Winders, Logitechs, etc.. and they usually die because the springs that center the stick strech out. This one feels like its built to last and so far no problems."
2,Great at first! Then takes a fall.,"Just like the rest of these reviews. Its one of the best joysticks u can ever have when u first buy it. After 6 month - 1 year the rudder starts to mess up. I have tried to calibrate it, but nothing happens,i tried to open it but the screws dont come of even though i have the right tools. Now i have to get a new one. At first i thought it was only me with this problem but as im reading it, everyone is having the problem, dont waste your money, u think it wont happen to u, but it does."
3,Everybody's got one.....,"I found the pace of this book slow. There were far too many new primary characters, and they were extremely under-developed. Bond, in this story, falls in love with an inept female spy he barely knows. Vague comparisons to his wife Tracy, killed on their wedding day, cause us to question this relationship. His subsequent relationship with another spy is also inconsistent with his expressed emotion. I wouldn't have finished this book if I wasn't such a fan"
3,good,This is the first james bond book i ever brought and read.The book is complicated with so many people using more than one name and in some cases using someone eles's name. i had keep flicking back.
5,"Great Book to find out the running routes on Oahu, Hawaii",Easy to understand and there are various running/walking courses on Oahu which never knew before. Great information and maps.
1,Terrible to open to fill,I have had these salt shakers for over a year. They are terrible. It is a fight everytime you want to fill them. I am buying new ones.
1,Video Card Incompatibilities,"We have 4 PCs, with video cards from 3 different manufacturers (ATI, Matrox, nVidia), and Crazy Taxi is only compatible with one of the cards (which happens to be my work PC). This information is only available on the CD-ROM. Very frustrating."
1,Price: $289.99 are you joking,you can get a professional hobby grade rc car for this price crap and waste of money do not buy this stupid cheap car that cost 20$ at wallmart lol
4,realy good except....,I got this in december and i haven't stopped messing with it yet. There is so much stuff you can do on. When they say pocketpc they actually mean a pc in your pocket. I have one complaint. I bought the foldable Belkin keyboard for this so i could do word documents and it doesn't work. The day i got it I istalled it and the driver for it was extremly bad it didn't work at all. I tried to uninstall it so that i could re-install it but it won't let me. I am going to try and return it and get a new one and find a nerdy computer guy to get it to work for me. In conclusion the system is really good but the accesories aren't.
4,lowest speed is too fast,"This saw had all the right features at the right price, so I tried it out. One of the key features I was looking for is a speed dial. I was disappointed that this saw sounds almost like it is running full speed even when the dial is on its lowest setting. The blade clamp did not look as robust as pricier saws. The case is the lightest I have seen for a power tool and was cracked inside even though the outside looked fine. The anti-vibration worked very well, and the adjustable foot felt sturdier than other toolless designs I have seen. This may be a great saw at a great price, but the ineffective speed control was enough for me to try something else."
2,Poor Taste and Hard to Swallow,"This is my first Daily Vitamin ever purchased and used. I have used vitamins before, and know that they tend to taste bad. However, I read reviews on Amazon of other daily vitamins with a not so bad taste. I can also imagine it wouldn't be too difficult for the maker to manufacture these with a better taste. If you are looking for a daily vitamin that tastes good (like I am) this is not it.I also found it was difficult to swallow, and will cause some discomfort."
1,The most outrageous book I've read since Diana's death!,"I knew what I was getting into because I read ""Lady"" Campbell's first book about Diana published when she was alive. The book is outrageously funny because ""Lady"" has taken every negative thing one could say about ANY person and pinned it all on Diana. Anyone who believes this trashing deserves to be ripped off for price of the book. I was armed with a true and believable comprehensive background on the royal family. Read Anthony Holden or Donald Spoto for quality instead of this wanna-be, wanna-he author. And, finally, Colin should have airbrushed that Adam's Apple out of his picture. I'd love to read a book on ""Lady"" Campbell."
1,Creator of drama,"I read her book on the Queen Mother and I wanted to check out another of her books to see how they compare. She seems to take facts/gossip/innuendo and then twist them to suit her narrative.Too bad, because there is enough drama without her having to invent some. I knew something was up when I read that Prince Charles' gift to Camilla, with the initials ""GF"", meant Gal Friday??? Oh please. What did he give his other mistresses?For me this book and its contents throws doubt on all of the allegations she heaped on the Queen Mother.There is nothing I like better than a good biography but you have to be able to trust that the author is being objective with the subject. I don't think you will find that here."
1,"Suspicious of the ""Washington, DC"" review by a reader","I am going to agree with the other reviwers that this particular review sounds suspicious. The tone reminds me of Lady Campbell's book itself and I found it rather juvenile to accuse reviewers who did not favor this book --and rightly so if I may add, lacking brain cells. In fact, if you like the tone of the Washington, DC review where ""a reader"" looks down on the ""unwashed"" Americans, you'll love Colin's book.I think the issue here is that the ""Real Diana"" is not a worthwhile read. I don't think the Americans are looking for books that idolize Diana, everybody including those who are ""unwashed"" can tell fiction from non-fiction. We know when we have been duped another ()bucks for what is really fiction passed on as the truth and feel frustrated."
3,"A not-so-objective view of the ""Real Diana""","If you want to hear another side to Princess Diana's story, this book is for you...Lady Colin Campbell portrays Prince Charles as the victim and Diana as the spoiled psychotic who manipulated her way into Buckingham Palace and, basically, ""asked for it"". The author claims to have been a friend of Diana's---one she could have done without. Diana is in a much better place now---one without this book."
1,"""Gentlemen"" ""Ladies"" ""Aristocrats"" ""Royalty""",Wouldn't it be a better world without such classes. They are so proper and discreet that Campbell got another book out of their silence.How many more people are going to get rich from writing the story told to the sister of the mother-in-law whose friend's daughter used to date the baker that delivered bread to Kensington Palace?This tabloid deserves 0 stars and am I glad I did't pay for it.
5,Piece of Cake,"Piece of Cake is an enjoyable way to wind down and get some movement in after sitting at work all day! It is a great beginner dvd. After work I often don't feel like a strenuous workout, but I do want to get some movement in..... this is great for that! So if you don't want a meat and potatoes work out, get a Piece of Cake. Have fun! Belly dance!I like to rotate my dvds so that it is not repetitive. I use beginner dvds on days that I just don't have enough ""oomph"" to put into the others. Shimmy on!"
1,Silly movie,"I'm sure that back in the early 90's when I seen this as a kid it probably blew my mind, now its just downright funny! This movie is filled with amateur martial arts, bad acting, and useless characters. Im not even gonna go into detail just watch it to get a good laugh and to see how far martial arts movies have come today."
1,Don't bother,"Only used it a few times, and it has fallen apart. Plus getting discolored. It can be difficult to open to put tea in or take out. Bottom line: It's cheap in every way."
1,Do not purchase!,"The latch that clasps the sides together broke off before the second time I used it, but I was able to stick it on. I began noticing rust after the second time I used it and then I could no longer fix the clasp, because of the rust, so I threw it away."
1,Don't buy it!,This tea ball does not hold the tea very well. Every cup of tea I have made so far has several bits of tea leaves in it because they somehow leak out of the area that holds the two halves together. Don't buy it unless you like chunky tea.
1,Terrible Very Disappointed.,"This tea infuser sucks! So Much Tea comes right through this thing. It was made horribly. I strongly suggest you go with a different one. This is what happens when you try to save a little money, you end up waisting money."
2,tea leaves come out,I would like this tea ball if the tea actually stayed in the ball. Because there isn't a latch on both sides the side that doesn't have a latch has a huge gap and the tea leaves escape the ball. I don't like having to strain my tea or eat it while I'm trying to drink and enjoy it. :-(
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"I was gifted with loose tea from Sri Lanka as a gift awhile ago but never was able to use it because I didn't have a tea ball. Finally ordered one and it came right away, so no complaints about that. However, the holes in the mesh are too big and you get a million 'floaties' in your tea. As I have 5 varieties of tea, tried the others with same result. Very disappointed in the product. I gave it two stars for fast shipping."
1,You get what you pay for,I bought three of these and in just over a month all three of the hasp have broken off. i will buy the scissor style next.
4,tea diffuser,"as expected, good speed and service. nothing incredible about this though it is a tea ball. y there is a word limit i hav no clue"
1,Garbage,This thing is total garbage on the second use it fell apart and spilled the tea leaves into the water. After that I could not get it to stay together. I only paid $1.50 for it so I guess I should not be surprised. Spend the extra money to get one that actually works.
1,Rust,"After one use, one strainer started showing signs of rust. Pretty disappointing, but I guess I couldn't expect much from something this cheap."
4,Good value,"The clasp that holds this together was a little more flimsy than I anticipated. However, it keeps the tea inside, and works very well. This item is a very good value!!!"
1,Confusing product description,"This item was advertised as 8th edition and is published on June, 2010. However, the reviews given under this product were earlier than 2010. Also, some reviewers were saying this is a 2006 or 6th edition. There is a confusion going on here, I think...Thank you."
5,Indispensable regardless of major or profession,"As an earlier reviewer mentioned this reference is worth its weight in gold. I still have the 3rd edition which I purchased as a college freshman in September of '91. Almost 20 years later and I still refer back to it on a regular basis for style tips, grammar, and syntax. It doesn't matter if you're a student, professional writer, or someone who never pens more than the occasional memo - you will find this book well worth it."
3,"Quit acting stupid.......""I'm not acting!""","Ordering on line is good and bad........good Amazon has everything ever manufactured by human civlization on line for quick one click purchase.........bad, you have to read the description, so even though the big fat ass show the little cups full of exotic spices, when the description reads ""spices not include""........well you have to read that part.......lol.......so if you want to spend $25 bucks on a metal tin with 6 empty tin cups inside this ones for you......at best average quality........"
2,Not as described,The description says that there is an inner lid and an outer lid but there is only one lid. It also says that there are 7 spoons but I only got 2. Would not buy again.
4,whimsical narrative of the ancient and modern Kokpelli,"Dave Walker gives you a modern twist on the ancient myth turned recent Southwest icon. The author also offers you some illustrations of the modern marketing of the Kokopelli. Overall, the book is fun and easy reading. A good book for a day in the park, ride on an airplane or just a lazy day!"
4,The best 'give-up-smoking' book on the market!,"When Joe Esterhasz gets to about page 600 he reveals he has cancer of the oesophagus because of his smoking, drinking lifestyle. The book, at that moment, takes on a surreal tone and you realise the irony of what has gone before. It is a great work, not a great literary work but as a detailed picture drawn by a talented although slightly eccentric screenwriter who manages to alienate more people (according to the book) than most. Sometimes the detail is self-indulgent and unnecessary, such as the over-done italicised love letters/diaries of his second wife. I must admit I could have done without most of those but for the most part, and for the lifestyle 'don't smoke' warning, and for the Hollywood gossip, this is worth a read, especially if you like stories about movie directors lusting after starlets...who doesn't?"
3,Wrong Fit,I ordered these rear flaps to fit my 2010 F-150 as identified by the online fit guide. Unfortunately they did not fit and I had to return. I like style and quality so I will see if I can locate the correct model number.Husky Liners 57591 Black Custom Fit Rear Mud Guard - Pack of 2
3,mouse,"this mouse was very tiny, since I have small hands it was great at the time, my only problem was the cord was too short."
4,"Great mouse, careful with the cord","I bought this mouse back in 2007 and feel the mouse is great for everyday laptop use and travel (love the small size). This mouse has optimal response when used on hard surfaces (i.e. tables or desks... not so great on couch, pillows or leg).I prefer this mouse to Microsoft's Wireless Optical Mouse 4000 for gaming on the laptop since the wireless mouse's connection is sometimes spotty and overly sensitive.The only downside to this mouse is the cord. Be careful when traveling with it since the cord is fairly thin and frays easily near the USB connector. If you don't wind the cord too tightly around the mouse it should be fine.Overall, really dependable mouse and highly recommended."
5,Economics in Plain English,"The best book I've ever read, concerning Economics. One of the best non-fiction books I've ever read. Mr Sowell is very articulate and does not preach/teach. He explains Economics with verbal examples that are easily understood but not simplistic. If you read this book, you will learn something about Economics, while actually enjoying the experience."
3,"Unique, but not so good","I'll be mercifully brief. If you like Morris dancing & rock music, & you stumbled across this CD, you'd be utterly delighted.But as someone who's almost worn out the original ""Morris On!"", this effort came across as overproduced & underenthusiastic.If you like this sort of crossover, you first ought to get ""Morris On!"", & Philip Pickett's ""The Bones of All Men,"" & maybe The Albion Band's ""Rise Up Like the Sun"" -- the personnel overlap between all four CDs is significant, but those three sound properly caffeinated."
5,Perfect,I like to work with medium length knives and this is it. They are comfortable to handle and sharp. I may be replacing my knives with Victorinox in the future.
2,Clumsy shape & size,"I bought 4 Forschner knives for my mother so I could have some workable cutlery when I cooked for her. My own knives are Wusthof Classic and I like their slim handles and blade heavy balance. The 8"" Forschner cook's knife felt clumsy at first with a light blade and fat handle, but turned out to be a very serviceable bargain. The 5"" mini-chef is a very good utility knife. The 6"" chef knife doesn't have enough blade/handle clearance for chopping and is too long and clumsy to be a useful utility knife."
4,"good, but not really a chef's knife","I've got a Chicago Cutlery 6"" Chef's knife which I like a lot but wanted to try something else, and at the price figured, ""why not?""Because the blade depth on this knife is relatively shallow I don't find it very useful for fine chopping and mincing which is what I bought it for.That said, I really like this knife as a slicing knife. It is sharp and holds the edge well... it has a good sturdy blade with a stiffness that I like for cutting through meat, cutting up chickens, and also for slicing cheeses. The handle is very comfortable for me. (Curiously, I had bought this as a gift for my daughter but she didn't care for the handle and if you have smaller hand you may not either -- although she likes the Victorinox 8"" chef's knife.)All in all, this is a good, all around kitchen knife... it's just not a chef's knife."
5,6 Inch Chef's Knite,"This knife is recommended by Cooks Illustrated Magazine, and it quickly became my favorite knife for everyday tasks."
4,works fine for me,"I've owned this for a couple of months now. I am in San Antonio Texas about 30 miles northwest of the majority of station antennas. I use a 40"" UHF antenna mounted outside and pointed roughly southeast. This unit brings in about 15 channels, including the big 3 networks at 80% or better signal. I've had no problems with it whatsoever. My only complaint is the networks do not transmit reliable guide information, if any, but that's not a fault of the product. No more cable bills!!!"
5,You've got to get this 'stick!,"I've had this joystick for about 4 months now and would bet my last penny that this is the best on the market. The force feedback effects are so life-like that sometimes it's absolutely frightening. I've used it with European AirWar,Flight Simulator 98 and Flight Simulator 2000 and would never, ever, buy any other stick. It is a huge stick but it is as solid as a rock. If this one ever wears out I'll definitely get another."
5,Enhance your spiritual life...use wisely,"I am a Christian, but I find these beads to be practical during my daily quiet time. They help me with my focus when my thoughts stray. Holding them in your hands is important, just to remind yourself what they are for and what you want to pray for.I hope you enjoy them as much as I do."
4,Insider's view,"It is not often that one can read an insiders view of the institutions that most of the protestors want to tear down. His review of IMF policy and approach to the Asian and Russian financial change is illuminating. He doesn't gloss over China's human rights abuses (but he doesn't highlight them very much either.) He provides an analysis of what went wrong, and suggestions for making the world a better place.His style is easy to read, and one doesn't get bogged down in massive footnotes or techincal economic jargon. But that said, he doesn't turn an inward eye at The World Bank. Or review any projects like the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh or other similar projects."
4,The IMF and its discontents,"This is primarily a book about the IMF executing the US treasury and Wallstreet agenda (the Washington consensus) (with Camdesus, a frenchman, in US service ?). Stiglitz critique has a ring of credibility, he seems to have the facts right but I have no independent sources to check it against. The processes described seem to go on unabated, that makes the book despite its 4 years current enough to warrant reading."
3,Okay product.,"If you're looking to permanently straighten your toe, this isn't the best product. (I think pedicure toe separaters do a better job of stretching and straightening though your tendons are more likely to be stretched and your feet will most likely be sore, as with any body part that isn't normally stretched.) This product is, however, a good cushion. It wasn't exactly comfortable for the first minute or so, but then I got to walking and I forgot about it. I never wear pointed-toe shoes so I do not know how they would feel in that type of shoe. However, I have worn one in boots, running shoes and mary janes and the cushion stays in place just fine. I've also worn one to bed and it stays in place as well, no socks necessary. There are two in a package. For the price, I'm satisfied."
4,helps a bit,This toe trainer is soft & comfortable to wear in a shoe. It helps a bit with a hammertoe. It would be better if it was a little wider for those with longer toes.
1,worthless,"High hopes for this product to help my hammer toe were met with absolute disappointment. Flimsy, stretchy material did not keep its shape nor did it do anything like advertised. Don't waste your money or add to your local landfill."
2,might be me,Must qualify this review by stating I'm not sure what the deal with my toes is. It was just as uncomfortable with the item on as off. I feel this is something that may work for you or not
4,CLassical Clarinet Lovers Look Here!,"This is a very good CD that covers a broad range of music. The Mozart Concerto for clarinet is especially good, as Emma is able to really make it sing. Other highlights on this disc are the Finzi Bagatelles and the ""Victorian Country Gardens"". Both are exceptional pieces of music. I had never heard Emma play before, but now I am hooked, and I can't wait to get another recording. I definetly reccomend this for the classical Clarinet lover."
2,"Night of the ""Couldn't Get a Date""","This package of movies is called ""The Midnight Horror Collection,"" perhaps, because they hope you'll be too loaded by midnight to comprehend much of what's on the screen, but this bunch of movies isn't all that bad. But then, I paid around $4 plus $3 S+H for this single disc, 4 movie package (fact - no brag), so I wasn't expecting enough to be very disappointed by what I got - and I wasn't. If you're old enough to have really learned that ""you get what you pay for"" (except when you get very, very lucky, or your expectations are pathetically low), and you love zombie films, then part with the cost of a fast food lunch and experience the good and bad of micro-budget zombie cinema. Two of these movies were startlingly bad and 2 were fairly competent ""low budget"" horror films. Not gonna say which were which - go ahead, have the experiences and embrace them. It won't kill you. Or, will It? Sorry, I couldn't resist."
3,Low-Budget Zombie Flicks,"I bought the Flesh Eating Zombie series, which was wrapped up with Midnight Horror Collection: Killer Curses, for only five dollars at my local Walmart. I was only interested in Last of the Living Dead which is a horror comedy from New Zealand. I've seen I Am Omega before, which is a ripoff of I Am A Legend starring Will Smith. Considering I didn't pay much for the movies I'm satisfied with my purchase, but the movies are low-budget with horrible acting.Side A:Awaken the Dead (2007; 102 minutes; Not Rated)Grave Mistake (2008; 95 mintues; Not Rated)Side B:Last of the Living (2009; 87 minutes; Not Rated)I Am Omega (2007; 88 minutes; Not Rated)"
2,Too low budget,"These movies are too low budget for me, don't get me wrong I like low budget cheesy horror films, but these movies with the expection of ""I am Omega"" look like they were made for a high school film class.I see better quality on the sci-fi channel on sat. nites. To me the only one worth watching is ""I am Omega"" which a variation of the""I am legend/omega man/last man on earth""/ movies based on Richard Matherson's book."
2,grinding element broke in 9 months...,"I got this mill as a Christmas gift last year, and with only moderate home use the plastic (not ceramic as in most good mills)grinding element inside the mill cracked last week. I must say, however, that while it was working, i found it to be a sturdy, versatile, functional mill, the best i had ever owned. That said, one would expect the mill not to break down in less than a year.Note: if anyone has the address for Trudeau so i can sent my mill back, please email me privately. Thanks."
4,It's not all DePhazz,"This CD is a compilation of Mole Records artists - not all De-Phazz. It's a great mix of downtempo/jazz and electronic. Transfattyacid is by Lamb and remixed by Fila Brazillia - excellent version. CD is about 6 years old but includes some good tunes that you cannot find available elsewhere. Mole Records has put out several compilations like this one - covers are similar in look; with crisp, mod visuals. Look for Mole Listening Pearls. ..."
4,An oldie but a goodie,"This first person style game is fun, and does have limited interactive ability (they took the servers down, so youd have to figure out how to lan it if thats possible). Its good if you have no idea of how the original RPG functions, the inconsistencies are a bit annoying, but I found them not insurmountable. Overall I would reccomend this game as old but still fun for the single player, the final chapters are pretty challenging."
1,this is basically a Bible study,"What Amazon's information doesn't tell you is that this is a study of Bible verses and questions for a group study of their meaning, etc. --I had been expecting something much different. It may not be much money but if you're not doing a Bible study then don't waste yours."
4,Pretty decent toy,"This toy is cute and simple. It rolls pretty well, mostly on hard floors, but will work on low carpet. My daughter enjoys watching it zip away, and it can go pretty fast."
4,My daughter loves this,My daughter is special needs and difficult to buy gifts for. She loves this toy and it helps with her learning (cause and effect).
5,Very fun toy for as young as a 1 yr. old.,"...and for a Grandma to play with too! Sturdy, fast as it speeds off, but not too fast. Does not hurt if it should accidentally run into anyone!"
4,Pleasantly surprised,"As I had read some of the other reviews, I was a little worried but really wanted my nephew to try this. He's 16 months and at Christmas, I was so pleasantly surprised to see how easily he could push down on the inch worm and the toy even rolled on the carpet. I can't imagine how well it's going to work on their hard wood floors when they get home. Very colorful and he seemed to love it. Glad I decided to go ahead with the purchase."
5,Brisk brown Pumps Charles David,Excellent. Great price. But ran a bit larger than what I expected for a 5.5.
1,This book is a complete waste of time and money.,"We were terribly disappointed with this book. ""Choose Florida for Retirement"" provided us with no new information about the cities and counties in Florida that we hadn't already found ourselves on the internet previous to this purchase. My advice? Skip the book and do your own (free!) research on the 'net. You'll probably learn more about Florida in one day than you could ever possibly learn from this book."
5,great cleaner,this is the best shower/tub cleaner I have ever used!spray it on and wait ......a few minutes later the scum wipes off!
3,Interesting. Needs more episodes would make a great tv show ron rivchin,Want to see more. expand and expose scams. Needs better photography also. I just watched this megan fox movie and it is wonderfulJennifer's Body
5,Excellent! A must for living in this unbalanced society!,"Shirley MacLaine's presentation is clear and enlightening. It helps one to connect with the power within and use it to heal and inspire. Everyone should do this ""workout""!"
5,Excellent look at Japan,"For someone brought up almost all his life that Japan is the model to strive for, M. Porter et al convinced me I was wrong. Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of any nation is a formidable task, but even more so for a country like Japan. This book takes a hard and critical view at Japan. And what we see is not a pretty site! Highly recommended. Both full of hard data, and case studies."
4,"Third time is only somewhat of a charm, but still enjoyable","As a fan of the previous two seasons I was pretty happy to see that Comedy Central released the final season on DVD. For a while I wasn't sure that they were going to make it available. This DVD compiles all of the episodes in all of their uncensored glory, an act that sometimes works against the show rather than for it. Sometimes it's funnier to hear a bleep or view a pixelated body part than it is to actually see/hear it.Even so, this DVD is still pretty darn good. The final episodes are still entertaining & fans of the show (like me) will be glad to have their collections complete. There's also a lot of great extras in this set (which I have yet to have the time to fully explore) that's sure to please most."
1,A Waste,"I should have visited with others before buying; this is a waste of money. The ""humor"" is not, there are long stretches of nothing followed by dull wit. Save your money."
5,Good stuff,"I am writing this assuming there will be a lot of negative reviews. It is not for the Bible belt mentality. It is crude, rude, blasphemous, dirty, sexual, and f u n n y! So many things that only make sense to a specific generation! I love it. If you don't, why did you buy it or even watch more than two minutes of it?"
1,Avoid,Can't believe this type of garbage actually exists. I would have given it 0 stars but that wasn't an option.
1,Review,"OK, so I really hoped that this would be the last armband I buy for my iPhone and/or iPod, but it sucks. I don't get it all; it's velcro but the smalled fitting is still too big for my arm. I don't understand why they did not make the velcro to tighten as much as anyone wants to. I have small arms and I can't use this thing. The other thing is that the phone and the iPod can easily slip and fall out of it. There is nothing that fastens the devices in: no snaps, no velcro, no strap, nothing that hold the thing in, so watch out. If you buy this thing, which of course, I recommend you don't, be careful and make sure your arms are bigger. I am not that small. I am a female, 5'7"" and weigh 134 and the band is too loose. I am not sure it's worth my efforts to return it."
5,Great Book!,This is a great book! This is one of the best books I'v read on guitars. Everyone who plays should read it.
5,Wonderful Singer,"Years ago I bought the Duke Ellington LP ""In a Mellotone,"" compiled by Nat Hentoff. I was knocked out by Ivie Anderson's singing on ""I Got It Bad"" and especially on ""Rocks in My Bed."" Then I found a two-record LP ""Duke Ellington Presents Ivie Anderson."" Excellent. In the age of CDs I was lucky to find ""It don't mean a thing,"" issued on the Living Era label. It has many of the songs from the Ellington sessions plus a bonus recording of Anderson with Phil Moore and his orchestra.Ellington's orchestras, in its many permutations -- Ivie Anderson and her Boys from Dixie , the Gotham Stompers -- swing like crazy and the solos that Ellington composed or arranged are all excellent.I am a big fan of Ivie Anderson's vocal style - relaxed but swinging, understated emotion: ""That man is lower than a snake in a wagon track!"""
2,Recommended only if you are exceedingly poor,"This is perhaps the cheapest and smallest scientific calculator you can get. It provides all of the basic functions: trigonometric functions, logarithms, powers and roots, etc. It provides various conversions: minutes and seconds to decimal format, angle measures, and rectangular to polar. It can handle fractions. It provides multiple number bases (but in a limited range). It has statistics functions. The metallic blue finish is very good looking-unfortunately, it makes the shifted functions almost impossible to read. If you spend a little more money, .... you can get a much more capable and usable calculator, for example, with a hard cover (instead of a vinyl slipcase), a two-line display (instead of one), multiple memory registers (instead of one), etc."
4,Recommended: very moving and well written,"I really enjoyed reading ""A Blessing Over Ashes"". It was unlike any book that I have read, and broadened my vision considerably. The stories from the early chapters were very moving and written in a beautiful voice. I read the chapter about catching fish with bare hands in a Vermont stream to my 4 year old daughter, who laughed with delight right along with me. Those later stories about the Cambodian slave camps were horrifying, fascinating and nearly moved me to tears. I feel after finishing the book like I was part of the family, albeit one very different from my own."
3,"good book, that's it-","The book is about an american family who adopts a Combodian boy who suffered a lot, an lived a very different reality from them. The book is told by one of the american brothers. It is a very good book but I think it was quite ""descriptive"". I think the end could have been better. It seems as if the author leaves you in the middle of the story, as if he did not know how to end it. I enjoyed it, and it is not a ""heavy"" book, but not excellent for my taste."
3,Not impressed.....,"This case is ok except for the fact its small and seems kind of flimsy....I tried to use it for a few weeks, but ended up putting it in the recycling bin. It might be good for someone who takes small pills."
3,Micro Detailing Tools,"Over all, the tools work great. They would be even better if the blades and handles were a little longer - sometimes I get a little nervous working that close to a turning. A couple of more inches on both ends would definitely help."
5,The Elephander the best Zoid ever,"The mighty Elephander is an awsome high preformance Zoid. It may be a little harder to make than the rest, but it's definetly worth it. It comes with two different faces, three different ear attatchments, three different trunk attatchments, two different back attachments and to top it all off it runs on batteries instead of [...bad] wind-up. It walks and its trunk moves just like the real thing. If you want to have fun, or if you're a collector, this is the Zoid for you! Like many Zoids Tomy makes conversion parts for this Zoid."
1,Oh NO!!!,"There are many much nicer cd's of this type of music available, luckily there have been made many recordings of mexican piano music from the XIX century ,this one would be good except for the pianist Guadalupe Parrondo, I don't like her.Stay away from it!!!!"
5,Great Read!!,"This book was really good and I would recommend it to anyone who like romance and time travel. It is about a woman who meets a 1800s cowboy and falls in love, though somewhat reluctantly. The story is full of adventure and will keep you on your toes the entire time. This is definatly a worthwhile read."
4,Ghasi Ram Blues - Good stuff.,Ghasi Ram Blues alone is worth the price of this CD. This track is really new and different and I've never heard anything quite like it.Some of the other tracks have some beautiful Indian style vocals. Aside from that I'm not a real big user of music intended for meditation so for me much of the rest of it is a yawn.
5,So Beautiful!,A great collection of traditional Scottish songs and some classical tunes thrown in as well. McKellar is an excellent tenor that employs gorgeous tone quality and perfect diction in his recordings. Wonderful!
3,Lid didn't hold so well,"They were nice to store things in, but my crystal ornaments must be too heavy because the lid would come unsnapped and I almost dropped the whole thing. I still use them, but make sure I hold them by the bottom and not the lid. They are a great idea, but the paper dividers need to be heavier."
2,cheap NAS for casual stuff,"i slapped a spare and used HD into the CN-350 and got it going on the home LAN. My purpose was to get machines leeching off music, video and pictures off my PC when i am doing serious stuff on it. So i moved some files on to this NAS and that's what i'm using it for...its very limited function wise but that's what i paid for !"
1,DOes it work with a Mac ?,"Say's it works with a Mac, but by the very poor Mac instructions you'll never get it to work.Disappointing."
4,"A Concentrated, Accessible, and Suprisingly Useful Reference","This text covers a broad range of topics in statistical and numerical analysis. It is most appropriate as a suplemental reference for senior undergraduate and beginning graduate students in statistics, computer science, and electrical & industrial engineering. Smarter MBA students will also find this usefull.The book's subject range is achieved by sacrificing rigor and depth on the altar of accessability. This isn't nessesarily a bad compromise...I find this book suprisingly useful to establish a beachhead when tackling a subject that is either new to me, or is many years past in my schooling.It certainly makes for inspiring bathroom reading, and it remains the only book I'll bring to the beachhouse this summer."
3,Wit Woo's CD Enjoy is almost enjoyable,"I like Wit Woo very, very, very, very, very, very, very, much. That have a very, very, very, very, very, good sound that is very, very, very, very, very, nice. The can rock like an abolone in a muscle shell with a very, very, very, very, very good attitude. They have clever lyrics that are so clever that they are stupid. That is why I think Wit Woo's album Enjoy is very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, nice. The reasons are stated above. Now I think I have used 75 words. So thank you."
1,bipolar has little or no advantage,"I was intrigued by the title, but very dissapointed in the book. Mr. Wooton seems to be more manic than depressed. As he states himself, a doctor friend once told him he never met someone who is manic all the time. Most bipolars are more depressed than manic.In addition, he claims to have a very high IQ. He says the right answers always seem to pop into his head. A lot of his successes can be attributed to that. Not all bipolars have a high IQ. That has nothing to do with being bipolar.While it is probably true that many bipolars are highly creative individuals, their talent is often wasted because they are too ill to be productive."
1,This book gives bipolars a bad name not an advantage.,"I wish I would have read the reviews of this book before I bought it. It's offensive, crass, rude, and insensitive to say the least. The language and life examples are sometimes very inappropriate. If Tom Wootton is so intune with being bipolar, then I think he would be more sensitive to bipolar triggers while writing his book. He seems to think he can say anything and people will respond because he's so great. A definite ego problem."
2,Not Advantageous,"I agree there are traits that Bipolar people share, but all of us are individuals. He speaks of wigging out and using it to an advantage. I don't often do this and I don't recommend that people use it as a tool. Sometimes people can get really hurt by it."
3,Cheap knockoffs,"It is indeed two new PS2 controllers and a PS2 multi-tap, but the multi-tap is apparently just whatever random thing they can find. I got a DreamGear multi-tap and it works just fine, so no complaints there. But the controllers are cheap knockoffs and they are awful. They work, but the buttons stick and they break easily. Some buttons have to be pushed rather hard to get them to work so the pressure sensitivity is useless. And the analog sticks don't move smoothly, either. Moving the left stick from the neutral position takes a bit of force, and causes the characters to jump in that direction when you just need them to walk slowly forward.But the controllers are new, and they do work (at least, it's better than nothing), so it's a good cheap, temporary fix. Might be better in the long run to just buy a name brand controller, though."
1,Multi Tap,"The multi tap does not work. What a disappointment. However, we have not given up and are still trying to get it to work."
2,Cheap!,"Used panels, My son and I play a lot of games, wore the first one out within a month. Using second one now. Adapter didn't work."
5,Very Enjoyable Listen,"I bought this CD primarily because I really like the song ""Sunflower"" and wanted the version on this disc. I am very satisfied with that song and have very much enjoyed the rest of the music as well. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys this genre."
3,Hugs & Kisses are cool.,I bought Exes an Ohs with no expectations. I actually wondered how LWord influeneced it was going to be. It was light hearted and fun. Nice to see a series that's driven from a different perspective - looking forward to season 2.
1,A wasted opportunity...,Very little biomaterials science involved at all. Previous text by Silver was a far better primer for biomaterials science. A disapointment.
1,Everything that was bad with New Wave SF,"This is a dire piece of drek. It combines everything that was bad about the New Wave, made the sex and violence both utterly gratuitious and utterly uninteresting, and makes blunders about biology, physics, and computers on nearly every page.But what's worse is that it's not a novel. It is, instead, a writer's bible for what could be a novel. The structure alternates between chapter long exposatory dumps, and chapter long meetings between talking heads where they give each other ""As you know, Bob"" style exposatory lumps.Avoid."
5,awesome-est kitchen gadget EVER,"I got this rice maker about 10 months ago from Amazon and I'm so in love with it that I'm going back to review it in hopes that someone else will buy it and experience its wonder. I use it probably 3 times a week, my roomate and I eat a lot of rice. Cooks it so perfectly. Way better than the regular pot style rice maker I had before this one, or just on the stove. I never thought I would be so opinionated about rice. Totally unexpected use at least once a week: I use the porridge setting to make steel cut oats for my breakfast. 1.25 cups oatmeal to 3 cups water. I set it up the night before with a timer for approx 10 minutes b4 I want to eat, and when I'm ready for breakfast it's all ready for me. It reheats well for the rest of the week.Also, it plays twinkle-twinkle-little-star and tunes to tell you when it's done cooking."
5,Best cooker ever,It takes over 45 minutes to cook rice of any kind except white rice and the taste is just so very much different than it would have had been if cooked in some other kind of a cooker. I use it all the time to make fried rice or some other stuff and everyone in my home absolutely loves it. It is so much more easier to handle and cook. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
5,Great Rice Cooker,"This rice cooker is amazing. If you follow the instructions, you will always have perfectly cooked rice, even brown and sushi rice."
5,"Zojirushi NS-TGC10 Micom 5.5 Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer, Stainless Steel","Happy with this product. Cooked white rice, sushi rice, mixed rice and brown rice better than my old rice cooker. The timer is very useful. Love it!"
2,Worked fine- for a while,"We bought this rice cooker in March 2008 based on favorable reviews. It worked fine for about a year and a half, then started to have problems starting the cycle. Sometimes it wouldn't start at all; sometimes it would start, then turn off. We contacted Zojirushi but they offered no help -out of warranty. Sorry about you luck. We've tried to continue to limp along and use it rather than drop another $150 on a new one. We're now to the point it ruins the rice as often as it cooks it. Shuts off in the middle of the cycle. Guess we'll need to replace it and buy a Sanyo. I really think an appliance costing this much and used rather infrequently should last much longer, plus Zojirushi customer service was a real disappointment."
3,"An Important Read, If You Care.","Jansen is known for being a pioneer in the awareness of censorship in the late twentieth century. In her widely read and referred to text, Censorship, she asserts, ""The question is not, `is there censorship', but rather `what kind?'""(25). She then goes on to discuss the underground and less obvious ways that censorship has been practiced since the age of Enlightenment.What do Capitalist and Socialist societies have in common? They both practice censorship. The fact is, people and profit go together, and where you have discomfort, you have people choosing against it. While Jansen's work is too broad to get to the very heart of the issue, ranging from a look at Marx to a Greek Mythology and to the emergence of the internet, she raises questions that need to be looked at. This book is an important one, that has inspired many in the study of academic freedom and censorship in societies past and current."
3,British female voice hard to understand,I bought the talking clock for my mother=in-law. She doesn't hear well and the lady with the British accent is hard for her to understand.
1,useless for elderly,"Bought for my 89 year old mother. The voice is a female with an English accent and instead of saying ""eight thirty"", she says ""half past eight"". Confusing for my mother and makes this product absolutely useless to us!"
1,Got shipped the wrong pair of earrings,"I was sent Atlanta braves earrings, but they were not the ones I purchased. I wanted the ones with the tomahawk that said braves but I was sent the ""A"" pair"
3,"I could take it or leave it--hence the ""5"" rating...","Seems like folks either love it or hate... I liked parts of it---was disappointed with others. The charts are helpful. The sermon is frustrating. The recipes are so-so. The technique and method is great. The personal comments are long winded. Not the best book in the world---but not the worst, either. If you're into the idea of freezer cooking and bulk meals, you'll benefit from the book, even if you do need to wade through a lot of unrelated side stuff. If you're a Christian homemaker looking for more than just a cookbook (inspiration, homemaking tips, etc.), you may be thrilled beyond belief with the book. But as I said before, I could take it or leave it."
3,"Needs a ""cooking only"" version","This was not a bad book, it just seems to be directed at one particular audience to the point of alienating everyone else. Her charts were pretty good, although there was not a whole lot in terms of recipes.Her story was interesting to read, ONCE, but not worth the price of the book if you are buying it for a cookbook. I would buy it if it were re-written without the life story and religious opinions--maybe she should have two versions out for sale."
1,Don't bother!,"I was quite dissapointed in this book. I wanted information about OAMC, not about Jill Bond's religious beliefs, personal opinions, or how often a week she washes her hair (really, its in there!). The recipes were not very interesting and I have found much better recipes,instructions and organizational tips on various OAMC web sites. I'm really glad that I checked out this book from the library before I wasted my money on it."
2,Too Preachy for Me!!,"I borrowed this book from the local library, so I could see it before I purchased it. There is some good information, some interesting recipes that I plan to try, and a good method for taking your own recipes and ""converting"" them to a OAMC plan. HOWEVER.....the book was incredibly preachy (so much so, that once I read her method for converting the recipes I returned the book to the library), that I was actually offended in places. The book would have been alot better (and I actually would have bought it) if it stuck to the OAMC conversion methods, shopping and recipes. I didn't appreciate her diatribes about why I should stay home with my family (I can't), and why I should homeschool my children."
4,a not so bad book,"i got no major issues with the content of the book, just another read on this topic. nothing special. my main source of disdain however, lies in the fact that amazon sent me what clearly looked like a heavily used book.i dont like that."
2,"Plenty of Knowledge, but too unorganized and unstructured","I had to purchase this book for a class I was taking. Only read 6 chapters, which is what we were required to read, and I found the book to just be way too jam packed with information. Packed so much to the point where I found it troublesome to retain it all. It's just constant terms and knowledge and more terms, much of which isn't important, just being thrown at you in an unorganized way. I don't know, maybe it was just being overwhelmed with information that made it seem unorganized.This book needs someone to go through it and take from it what students REALLY need to know, which I'm sure it's all there, and make a new book out of it. The book would probably be half the size of this book..."
1,It doesn't work at all!,"When I connect it to the car it says Link Error, meaning it is unable to read the codes. I followed the instructions exactly.My car is from 1996, so it should've worked. It does NOT have the newer CAN system."
3,Ehh,"I used it couple of times, it's okay, but not pinpointee enough. Just take your car to Autoparts or somewhere where they do free OBD readings, they use more sophisticated stuff. And it's free."
2,Not so good,"These discs may be decent for misc. files and data, but they have been horrible for .ISO files in my case. I cant seem to get an image file written to these (DVD - ROM book type) without some error. Verbatims work great 99% of the time for me. With these, I am only having about 25% success.Stick to Verbatims for large image files or non-standard book types. I tried to save a few bucks with these discs and wound up costing myself more- now I have to buy the Verbatims anyway...These are also not hub printable- the print area is a bit smaller than I like."
2,5 coasters in a row,"i use this dvds with imgburn to burn 8gb isos, sometimes they burn but they fail the error verification , some dont finish the burn. tried in different burners."
1,Not very reliable disks,"I had purchase these several times. The last two cakeboxes I got only burned 5 discs correctly. I got error codes or they would not burn at all. Maybe a bad batch since the previous ones I purchased did a better job, failing only a couple of times."
1,No successful burns yet,"I've gone through half of my 25-pack and each one has resulted in a failed burn, on two different drives (Sony and LG) and all different speeds. I get perfect burns at default settings with Verbatim DL blanks, so I will be sticking with Verbatim from now on. I appreciate that everyone will have different experiences, but I can't personally recommend the product as it has been a complete failure for me."
3,High Concept Vibes,"Good sound quality in keeping with the artists idea of an integrated piece. This cd demands serious listening to asimilate and enjoy. It takes some work, but its worth it."
4,"simple, yet effective","I was surprised by the ethnic ""authentic"" deli spin this book presented. Pleasantly surprised. The recipes, and short introduction, were interesting, unique, and demonstrate clear familiarity with the subject material. The recipes are all simple, which I think is good, and I would definitely recommend this book for the strict vegan or beginner cook. My only suggestion for improvement would be more ""meaty"" style dishes, and I think the kugel recipe in this book,The Gluten-free Guide to Vegetarian Recipes, while it isn't vegan, is better and more authentic and could be made vegan simply by leaving out or replacing the egg."
4,Very enjoyable!,"I became a fan of Kathryn Smith's after reading her first book,""Elusive Passion"". When I heard she had a second book out, I bought it immediately and it didn't disappoint. I like Smith'sunique writing style, and the way she deals with contemporary issues like domestic abuse, alcoholism and suicide. Her characters, Brave and Rachel, have a sense of humour, and her protagonists seem to genuinely care for and respect one another, something that is lacking in a great deal of historical romances. There is a subplot in this novel dealing with a lost love of a friend of Brave's, and I've heard Smith is working on a book about this couple. I'm looking forward to reading it.If you enjoy romance novels but are bored with reading the same tired plots and dialogue over and over again, this book is definitely for you."
2,Great Product Over Priced,"This is a great product. I own a restaurant and use about 5 cans per week in the winter. However, this is so over priced that it doesn't make sense and I'm close to calling it a rip off...I pay $7.80 each for single cans and if I buy the case (of 6) it's about $6.00 per can. Same product, same can at Restaurant Depot in San Diego. Therefore, if I had time to do so, I'd sell it all day at $10 a can and make a good markup and the buyer would save a bunch."
4,Narrative of modern Burma,"In this book, Emma Larkin skillfully weaves George Orwell's life into the fabric of modern Burma (Myanmar). Three of Orwell's books - Burmese Days, Animal Farm, and 1984 - create the background in describing Burma's life under British rule, and the rigidity of Burmese life today. I have always enjoyed a woman's approach to history (eg Wild Swans) , as women focus on the difficulties of feeding families and raising children in difficult times. I also gained a keen understanding of the private struggles of Orwell's life. It's a good read, but I think you should have an interest in political history, Myanmar or Orwell before you buy. I read this book as part of my background study for an upcoming trip to Myanmar. It served me well"
2,pos t vac,the ring can't keep erection to long even with the small size he doesn't work i am not going to use it
1,very disapointing!,"We purchased this unit in late March anticipating several long car trips. It was easy to install and use. However, the power cord had a loose connection and would often come unplaugged from the main unit during travel. We should have sent it back then, but decided to live with it. After the third use (each use being about 4 hours long), both screens stopped working. There is still audio, but no picture. Since the 90 day warranty has expired, Audiovox offered to fix it for a $85 fee, plus shipping. So - overall we got about 12 hours use from this $130 device..."
4,"So Far so great for 3 distructive, movie loving kids",Have used the dvd player for three trips so far and love it! Seems to be fairly sturdy compared to many others in the past. Love the carrying case. Only drawback I see is we can't use both sreens while using the battery pack(needed for use on a plane). The additional screen is light and very nice. Like the total of three headphone jacks for both screens. Very quiet and simple to use. Never have had a problem. So far its the best portable unit I have owned and have had several over the past 6 years.
3,not up to date,"This book is very technical and has good information, but it is not up to date as it was written in 2002."
5,Fun,My 8 month old son loves this toy. He hasn't yet learned to stack the toys or put them inside the croc....but he loves the sounds it makes and he loves to open and close the lid. And he loves to watch me put the blocks inside. Soooo cute!
3,Hmmmmm...,Not as useful as I had hoped. Still it does keep the toes comfortably spaced and flat. There is the cushion on the bottom which is not of much help to me but could be for some.
2,Need for bigger shoe,I was disappointed in the product because it came in a zip lock baggie instead of a package with instructions. I was disappointed because the item was so big that I could not wear it in my hiking boots. I have been able to use it at night time to straighten my hammer toe so I guess that makes it useful but it is not what I was looking for.
4,Gets the job done for me,"The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there is a strap on only one side of the splint for tightening, even though there are two loops for two toes. I have size 14 feet like another reviewer, but it stays positioned just fine on my foot. They flatten the protruding knuckles of my toes with no discomfort. I've had it for just two days, but if they hold up, I will re-order."
1,Completely unusable! Do not buy because this is not a good prodcut,This was complete waist of money. I want everyone to know that this DOESN'T WORK! Do not buy it or you will be uncomfortable and disappointed.
3,Allergy Sensitive Beware Otherwise Great,"This is a great toe straightener; however, if you have an allergy to elastic products, you might want to reconsider. My client wore this and had a strong allergic reaction."
5,Signorile shows us that gay communities can and do evolve.,"As a gay man who has survived the AIDS crisis and along the way witnessed the deaths of almost all of my friends in the process, it heartens me that Mr. Signorile is highlighting the fact that the gay community is flourishing and evolving. Though the picture he paints is a disturbing one at times the book reveals how gay life in America can and is progressing beyond the urban ghettos and that we can survive everywhere as equals in a society that has long sought to supress and reject us"
1,Low wattage,"As a leading gay studies figure (one cited again and again in this book) commented to me privately, ""Signorile is very clever at using the media, but he isn't very bright."" In ten years, no one will remember this eminently forgettable book."
5,One of the BEST Wrestlemanias the WWF has produced!,Clearly a great tape featuring some of the greatest wrestlers of all time. King Kong Bundy vs. Hulk Hogan in the steel cage was probably the BEST steel cage match I have ever seen.
3,"Good, but not one of the better WrestleManias","WM2 had its good moments and bad moments. Hulk Hogan vs. King Kong Bundy was great, as was the tag team title match with the British Bulldogs winning the belts. I didn't like the arenas that the event was in, and the guest celebrities sucked. But all in all, great wrestling action."
2,A Low Point For Hulkamaniacs,"This is watchable; not horribly impressive. It is one fo the few WMs where not one match is overly memorable. Even the ME steel cage match between the Hulkster and King Kong Bundy is that good. Anywas, fans of Hogan and/or WWF should get this; if only to complete one's collection."
2,WRESTLEMANIA II-NOT WORTH SEEING VERY OFTEN,"The second WrestleMania is somewhat more entertaining than the original, but not very good. In fact, it tries to live up to the original rather than try to be better. WrestleMania II is worth seeing once in a blue moon. Not a big disappoitment but very uninteresting. You should see some interesting matches as well as characters."
2,I Agree with the viewer from hyderpark,Read what the viewer wrote in hyderpark. I thought of the same thing.
2,Dried out inkpads,I recently purchased these ink pads but upon opening them I found them to be dried out. I tried adding a bit of water but then the ink just looked watered down and it had lost the bright color it is supposed to have. It would be nice if there were directions as to what to do if this happened.
3,So-So,"I really liked the first installment of this series. I started out loving this one too, but found myself somewhat disappointed by the time I reached the end.I though the murderer's identity was obvious from the very beginning. I also thought it was out of character for Annabelle to run out on a wedding, and then prolong her absence in order to go say hi to a friend. I also thought it was a bit too convenient how she suddenly figured everything out.The character of Leatrice must go. She adds nothing to the story except to be an annoying buttinsky, and since it's apparent that even Annabelle doesn't care for her, her continued presence in the middle of everything is just flat-out ridiculous."
3,Cowboy beebob was MUCH better,"This anime was ok, but why the hell do they have the face thing where hes completly 2D (I mean i thing thats as bad as you can get for drawing). The storyline isn't all that great, though. I HAVEN'T bought the product, but i watch it on adultswim. Instead get cowboy bebop the perfect sessions or something like that"
2,More for the Pokemon crowd than the Beebop crowd..,"The main problem with this series is that it never takes itself seriously long enough for anyone else to connect to the story and the characters. I got whiplash trying to hold onto the meandering storyline and the thematic hyperjumps from comedy to drama to action.Is Vash a supersoldier or a clown? The supporting characters are sometimes interesting but mostly annoying. The animation is so-so, very little of it is noteworthy.If you like Pokemon or Yugi-Oh then Trigun is for you, otherwise stick with Cowboy Beebop, Ghost In the Shell 2 or even Macross Plus."
3,Trigun-The Complete Boxed Set,"I loved this anime in the beginning. I loved the world in which this anime was placed. It played out well, revealing slowly the dark history of Vash, the main character, and the reasoning behind a lot of his actions. And then it just ends. Though the ending matches the character of Vash that was introduced early in the story before the past of Vash of revealed, it doesn't match the slow build up. It left me disapppointed."
2,Lack Luster,"In all honesty, we've been disappointed with this purchase. The series is wonderful. But, it looks like whoever made the Box set just went off and found a torrent and ripped the dvds like that. Or that they ripped it from VHS. The picture is often grainy and not smooth, not like it was even on Adult Swim years ago.The anime is great and everyone should try it. But, honestly just order the disks from netflix or something. The quality was just REALLY not what we were expecting. We still watch it, but only because of the quality of the series, not the quality of the dvds."
5,Got Anthology?,I actually purchased all of the anthology and it was outstanding! just relive those historic moments meant soo much to me a must buy for all true wrestling fans!
3,satisfying,"A beautiful look at an exciting niche. It is a thematic coffee table version of cool new online services such as the great ""tablethotels.com"" which is much more comprehensive."
1,Check the date published!,"My son was recently diagnosed, so I'm cruising and buying a lot of books ... and this one was recommended by the team that did my son's diagnosis. But it was published in 1989! There is so much new and evolving information about autism that I would be very cautious about buying a book even a few years old, let alone one that's over a decade out of date..."
2,Really Not That Good,"I went ahead and read this book because of all the great reviews. However, I was dissapointed. Other reviewers made it sound like a Southern version of Mystic River. It is not. I really could never connect to the main characters. Although there were moments of intrigue they were few and far between. The denoument lasts forever and I found myself skimming the last few chapters just to make sure nothing interesting happened at the end. Nothing did."
4,Bleak and sorrowful,"This is a sometimes beautiful and deeply disturbing novel about class struggle and violence in the rural south. With the calloused hands of a cotton farmer, the reader briefly holds and studies the ravaged souls of both sides of a divided society, and in the end is left picking at fibers of motivation for horrific acts of violence. Recommended."
1,no...just no.,"I hated everything.I didn't get one thing i liked and nothing fit.On top of that,I only got 9 pieces.well,it is a random thing so oh well.Wont be buying from them again."
3,Accepts Debut,The debut of german rockers Accept.This first offering finds the band sounding very much like their fellow countrymen Scorpions's early recordings.Much more melodic than what was coming down the road.Think early Deep Purple/Scorpions as what to expect....Standout cuts are Tired Of Me & Streetfighter. 3 stars
1,Cooking Essentials for the New Professional Chef Student Workbook,This book does not teach anybody anything. I listen to the reviews and thought it was a book to teach. It is only filled whith quiz after quiz. It is a WORK BOOK like it says. It is a test or quiz book. There is probubly an instruction book out there that complements this book. I don't think so though.Don't buy this book if you want to learn anything. Only buy this book if you want to test you knowledge. Don't make the same mistake I made.
3,"Not fireworks, but a cozy fire.","If you're a Mark Doty fan, there's no reason not to have this book - its contents reveal the younger poet working his way toward the greater expanse of his more mature poetry. It lends a neat perspective to Doty's later work. Is by no means his best, but hey. Neat anyway."
2,Conflict Resolution,"I was assigned this book for school.#1: The first chapter wasn't even in the book. I'm not sure if this was a printing error or not, but it doesn't appear to have been removed. To me, it lookes like it came from the printers missing the chapter.#2: Although the book does pick up towards the middle and later chapters, the introductary chapters serve little purpose.3: While I learned some about the subject, I would not have read this book of my own free-will. It is a good introduction to the subject, however it lacks some depth in areas you may be truely interested in."
1,Passing off personal bias as history,"I have been reading ""A History of Us: The Making of Thirteen Colonies"" with my son for his class and I have found myself explaining to him the religious and historical inaccuracies this so called scholar passes off as history. It's troubling enough to me that I have to explain religious history (not the history of religion)within the context of a so called historical textbook. It's even worse that her Biblical references such as the founding of Israel by Abraham or the founding of Islam by Ishmaile, to name just two, are wrong. How this text got past proofreaders is beyond me, and the fact that it did is shameful. If you're looking for a good historical reference for kids look elsewhere."
2,Dud!,"Not sure if it was just a dud or if they are all like this, but the charger chord had to be jiggled and turned a certain way for it to charge. And if you slightly move or tilt it, it would stop charging. Also, the Amazon listing says will work with or without the chord. Mine did not, so it was a must charge situation. With those issues, I didn't wait the allotted time for it to charge to see how well it actually worked. Wrapped it up and sent it back for a refund. Ended up getting the Andis 24140 Dual Voltage Cord/Cordless Hair Clipper which worked right out of the box."
4,Fun album,"This is a really good album, but Naked 2 is much better, with a selection that doesn't include their two US radioplay songs. You should really have both."
5,Best product & service - even in the 3rd World !!!,"After owning a Bullworker as a kid in the 70's,i decided to buy one again to get into shape again Bullworker style,the only style that work well...involved in rugby for 15 years i have seen a lot of products,believe me,this is the only one !!!Nowhere in South Africa could i find one...not in JunkMail either(i placed an ad with offer of R1000 (140 USD)...nothing happend !Thanx Amazon,i could not believe when i found it,ordered and the Bullworker was delivered in 10 days !My Bullworker has given me a new life again...lost 9 kg's so far (13 weeks)...must loose another 5 or so and i feel and look well in shape again.(Please note,i am not on any diet !!!)Thanx again.Frans van Niekerk - Pretoria,South Africa."
3,gave it away,don't see how this device can add anything to my workouts but it's just my opinion- there is nothing terribly wrong with it
2,too little range of motion,"This product would have been good if it has a longer range of motion for pulling. For compression it is pretty good, but failed miserably for pulling."
4,This is a mini-gym used from your favorite Couch!,"I feel this is a good product for anyone who does not have time to go to Gyms, or work-outs.It was sent to me when promised on Time by Amazon.com."
5,Another cute wibbly book,"Another cute book by Mick Inkpen, if you like other wibbly pig books you'll like this one, flaps are a little flimsy but as long as your little one is careful its fine."
4,Obscure little sci-fi flick delivers!!!,"What a concept...he slipped in time!!While The Atomic Man is not purely 50's sci-fi, as mentioned in otherreviews, it does provide enough interesting plot twists and thrills tokeep you guessing until the end.Definitely worth a watch for fans of the genre. I am proud to have thislittle seen gem in my collection. Nice story, creepy atmosphere, goodacting and a great score make this one worthwhile!!Also recommended for fans of little seen 50's type sci-fi are Mutiny in Outer Space, Satellite in the Sky, On the Threshold of Space, The Magnetic Monster and Riders to the Stars."
4,You can't argue about what really happened,This story was moving because of the trials she had to overcome and the denial she had to face. She continues to serve in spite of the ignorance and the complete disregard of the facts of her story. It is amazing to me that her faith stays intact after the Church she has risked her life to serve denies her.
5,still going strong,"great dvd, can't wait for the next one (though i gotta wait for my next pay check)."
5,UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.,THIS 3 PART MINI SERIES IS ONE OF THE BEST IMPARTIAL STUDIES OF THE REAL LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST I HAVE EVER SEEN. WONDERFULLY NARRARATED AND BEAUTIFULLY FILMED. IT IS A TRUE JOY TO WATCH. I WOULD SUGGEST ANYONE WHO IS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH TO BUY IT.
5,Always Awesome,"This is one of the best series, in my opinion.... The writing, the acting is always awesome...Many more to come I hope..."
1,Something to note,"I ordered this DVD, as I love the series. I noted it was sent from England---however, when we tried to watch it would not play . The reason : it was designed for either a ''universal'' DVD player or one for a different georgraphical area from the U.S. I am NOT blaming the seller.Without a Trace: The Complete Second Season----I just did not know that there are ''two kinds'' of DVD players . I am sure it was indicated on the information, but if one doesn't know something exists, you just don't look for it."
1,Lame,"This book is not worth the money. Many tips are not helpful. These boys actually said they were excited to increase their number of daily injections so they could save more used syringes. That stuff is medical waste, get rid of it!! I would not recommend it to any age group."
2,thanks for the review fan of the boys...,I wish they would let you write the reviews.....looking for more postings by you...Great heads up on Gary Moore ..purchased it and ....damn smoking!!!!! You could not be more on track except i know you only meant 2 stars cus 1&3 are more of the same...great for lizzy collection just to have a all inclusive library but you hit it on the nail.... poor collection and quality..by the way what is with the drummer..what is this a almost like rendetion of the boys......Thank you for your review......you know your stuff..got any hot tip on what dvd I should buy..and by the Way any heavy Ufo dvds you are fond of?
1,poorly delivered plot,"""I received a complimentary copy of this book in order to review it."" I thought the idea for the plot sounded like a very good one. I have loved dragons since beginning the Pern series in middle school twenty some years ago, so the idea of stories and adventures told by the dragon sounded great. This dragon,however, was really hard to like and the story was dull. There was nothing to make me care about the dragon or even the human characters. The end seemed very slow in coming."
2,The Truth About Dragons...they are really boring,"I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my review.Written in the form of a diary by Firedrake the Dragon, this is his tale of the work and purpose of his kind.Using human technology, Firedrake was able to record a short period of his life and his interaction with humans. He points out the human errors in myths about the great lizards.This writing took me longer to read than I had thought. It was rather slow moving and the human characters are weak and boring."
1,Very poorly written,"I can't believe this passes for published writing. There is no, and I mean absolutely no, structure to the author's writing and the subject matter is so jumbled together that it is very difficult to follow what arguments the author is making. To make matters worse, it seemed like every page had multiple parenthesis with explanations of the various terms and ideas and historical references the author mentions. I would not mind this so much if done moderately, but these parenthesis appear on almost every page, usually multiple multiple times."
5,This Picture Disc Rocks!,This is a great Halloween record especially for Parties. It has classic monster type songs that have definite 90's+ feel to them. It's the first time I've seen a picture disc like this too 5 stars for the packaging and for the music!
4,some cage nuts would have been nice,"There's not a lot one can say about a surge protector -- you can mount it in the rack, it distributes power and protects the line (in my case, on the load side of a UPS).Given how much these cost, however, some rack mounting hardware would have been nice. I had to scrounge in a junk drawer for cage nuts and mounting screws. Fortunetely for me, I had enough unused rack accessories to cannibalize from to mount the surge protectors."
3,Perfect for African-Ameican families!,"This video is very good for African American families as they are mainly shown throughout the video. One drawback though, is that the shots ""jump"" rapidly throughout, so it can be difficult for younger children to understand what they are seeing and become sort of distracting."
2,"Good concept, less-than-riveting style","I loved the idea of this book; there's nothing like a good send-up of the academic world. But it was the writing style that turned me off. While I'll admit my vocabulary expanded by leaps and bounds the further and further I read, it started to feel a little pretentious, and the story didn't move along quickly enough to keep my attention riveted. But, if you like extremely dry, prosaic humor, you'll still find many reasons to enjoy this book."
2,JAG THE 6TH SEASON,The 6th disc ended with [part1] of ADRIFT.Where is part 2? It ended right in the middle of an episode and left you blank as to what happened. I was VERY DISSAPOINTED with this. IT'S LIKE READING A BOOK WITH THE LAST CHAPTER MISSING.
5,Jag,The Jag Season CDs are great. But...... the packaging messed up the box during the shipping process. You used to mail in boxes and now use envelopes. The merchandise gets damaged in those envelopes.
2,Very basic advice,"If you know nothing about dressing yourself, this book is targeted at you. There's some good advice here, but some questionable advice as well, and some of the advice is already dated -- the monochrome tie/shirt combo went out with Regis' millionaire show. A much better book is Flusser's ""Dressing the Man."" And if you want a really good book on elegant living, try Bernhard Roetzel's ""Gentleman's Guide to Grooming and Style."""
2,Save your Money & buy her other book,"This is the very same book as "" Happy New Year Kung-Hsi Fa-Ts' Ai! ISBN: 051788592,which is also by Demi. It's the very same illustrations & information, but this book has less pages. Save your money and buy Demi's other book and get more pages & information for your money!"
3,"Buy for fashion, not comfort","I bought these shoes in black about a month ago when I really needed some new (NOT PATENT) leather pumps. I absolutely love the style, and they look gorgeous when I'm wearing them. However, that knot makes these shoes the most uncomfortable thing I've ever worn. I'm a shoe fanatic, and I know how to suck it up for a hot pair of shoes, but my toes were literally bleeding after the second day of wearing them. I don't even walk that much in my job. I now save these for special occasions."
3,Not for the TUFF-est,"We have bought many Planet Dog/Orbee-Tuff toys, and this one isn't one of our favorites. This ball may be good for dogs that just play fetch with it, but it is not for a dog that constantly likes to chew and mouth it. The outer white shell is starting to come apart from the red shell underneath. I do have two German Shepherds who are constantly chewing on it though. But for a longer lasting ball, try the Planet Dog glow in the dark ball, or one of their solid colored ones."
1,simply a poor choice,"would I buy this thing again ? no chance ! it gave me blurry vision and a slight iritation (which cleared quite quickly, the blurry vision though came back every single time i used this). doesn't hidrate. doesn't erase fine lines or wrinkles. no reduction in dark circles or pufiness (though i show the exact causes of dark circles and undereye bags which this cream claims to address). as far as dark circles are concerned, this doesn't even begin to compare to bobbi brown's under eye balm."
2,doesnt work,I used this for a good 6 months before deciding it doesnt do diddly. I make my own eye serum that is more effective at fading dark circles than this. And more moisturizing and lifting too. For a lot less money. Pass.
1,Don't waste your money,"I used this product religiously everyday. After a few weeks, I started to develop a rash and irritation. My friend used the same product and had the same results. Didn't like Teamine at all but it might be because I was allergic to it."
2,Didn't work for me,This product may work for some people but I don't think it works for people whose under eye darkness is genetic.
3,A different kind of detective fiction.,"This book is the first translation into English of the late Ibarguengoitia's works. It begins from a fact, the police find the bodies of six prostitutes buried in the yard of a brothel. From that fact, the book goes on to build a work of fiction, painting a picture about what might have happened.The novel is well-written, but the pacing is odd, which makes the book difficult to enter. This could have been an artifact of the translation. I cannot read the original Spanish, but the English felt stilted throughout the book, and was often frustrating to read.There were enough good things to explain the reputation, and I may well pick up a book by another translator."
3,fine selection,it'a very helpful especially when you are a newcomer in this field. it gives a great deal of information that would enrich knowledge base. i appreciated that I purchased the book.
2,Too Fast Paced,"I am a psychologist who teaches child psychology, a mother of a toddler, and a big fan of the ""Baby Songs"" videos. Unlike the other Baby Songs videos, however, the ""Rock and Roll"" tape jumps quickly from shot to shot, often focusing in closely on small parts of the pictures. Several of the videos that accompany the songs even focus in on pictures turned sideways and go quickly back and forth from color to black and white. While this appears to be an attempt to mimic adult music videos, this is not the best format for children. My toddler has a difficult time following it, to the point that it simply does not hold his attention. (The other Baby Songs tapes are great at holding his attention throughout.) In addition, this type of programing -- quick jumping -- has been linked to decreased creativity over the long run in children. I recommend another ""Baby Songs"" video over the ""Rock and Roll"" tape."
2,Hap Palmer has nothing to do with this DVD,"Amazon includes the DVD BABY SONGS ROCK AND ROLL under my name Hap Palmer. I just want to make it clear that I have nothing to do with this DVD. You can look at the box to confirm this.My songs are used in many other Baby Songs DVDs but I have nothing to do with the DVD BABY SONGS ROCK AND ROLL. It does not use my songs, I do not sing on it and I had no involvement in the production.Hap Palmer"
2,Queensryche is washed up!,"Although I too am a die hard 'ryche fan, I missed this DVD in my collection and just picked it up. While not going into the Degarmo argument that the band isn't same without him (it's totally not), the music was flat and Geoff seemed to lose some of his top end. It is hard to explain that you want to feel the energy from the music and the band, but it just isn't there.The problem is that the pulse of Mindcrime was just so good, this really pales in comparison. It is painful for me to watch this. It is like a boxer that has been in the ring too long. Pick up a used copy of Livecrime and buckle in and enjoy the ride.My copy of Evolution just got donated to goodwill."
1,Misrepresented on the web site,"I specifically choose the Second Season, Vol. 2 because the web site description said it was Color. The DVD cam and it states Black and White."
4,Little-known Welles,"This is probably Orson Welles' least-remembered film, though paradoxically it was the only one that achieved any real box office success when it was first released. In backing a Welles project most studios had to wait a decade a two for the cult fans to pick it up and turn a profit. Here Edward G. Robinson is a mysterious investigator on the trail of a Nazi fugitive happily ensconced in a small American town. The interplay between these two wonderful actors drives the whole show, although Robinson reportedly disliked Welles' directorial methods. It's a good effort, without the wild cutting and uninterpretable plots that eventually forced Welles out of commercial moviemaking."
2,Poorly written diatribe,"This is an poorly written diatribe that refects the author's intense dislike of MacArthur. As an historical analysis of the war, the book is sadly lacking and difficult to follow. Despite referance to many geographical features of the Korean peninsula, no map is provided beyond a simple map of Korea that includes only a handful of place names."
3,Gem Trails?,The location descriptions and maps are adequate to actually find the various places in the book. The color photos of the specimens are excellent but often give the rockhound false hopes of what will really be found. I guess my expectations were too high of what could actually be found in Colorado by the casual rockhound. Virtually every site that I have visited that was described in the book has been picked over for multiple decades with good specimens almost nonexistent. Anyone thinking that he/she can just go and get anything like the book's photo specimens is in for disappointment. I've come to the conclusion that the really good sites are never described in books like this.
4,Useful addition to astrology library,This author has some original points of view; but the work is not really an in depth analysis of astrology features.
3,not what I expected,"this ballet seemed to be from the 1950's where there wasn't much money to spend on sets, costumes and choreography. I am used to American ballets where the sets are gorgeous, the dancing is breath taking and the show is awesome. I felt very disappointed but I guess that is how an impoverished country was. anyway, I did not care for this cd at all."
3,Nutcracker,"Trying to find the original version with Clara as a young girl, needs to be on DVD. Adult dancer's don't interest me in a children's ballet."
3,Fair,"This is fairly nice, but the entire part that wraps around the neck doesn't get hot. Only part of it does. The wires that create the heat just aren't there. I used to have an electric neck wrap that did get hot in that area, but don't remember the brand. The parts that do get hot get really hot on high, so if there were more wires, it would be better."
2,"Wow, this is a hot one!","Wish I could say I love this. The size and quality are terrific, but even on the lowest setting (113 degrees) it is way too hot to lay on for more than a few minutes. Currently looking for something with a little less heat. =-("
2,True Story,"I was fortunate enough to live in the area where this movie was made.I know most of the native people in it. This edition is not as goodas the original,which I can't seem to find.It has been cut up andloses the whole essence of the story."
3,Only features songs from FTE and Surfacing,Typical Sarah snubbing her older material. This DVD only contains songs from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and Surfacing and unfairly snubs the wonderful Solace!Skip this DVD if you can appreciate ALL of Sarah's albums.
1,Used CD,I bought this DVD from Amazon expecting it would be new. It's not..it's old and scratched. But yet it wasn't taken out of the packaging. So is amazon repacking DVD's and selling them as new?Besides that it's a great DVD. Just wish I would of gotten what I paid for. A NEW unscratched DVD.
1,Thoughtless,"I agree with the previous review. I've read Hamburger's translations before, and will get that book now instead. This is really distorted stuff; and frankly I think it's crass, to inflict on another's poems so much of your own invention. I'm writing this to warn those who might consider buying this for the Celan."
1,Up in Smoke,"I used it for two weeks; cutting 1/4 inch thick wood for usein some collage art. It made a great deal of noise but cut well.Yesterday I tried to saw a 1/2 inch thick 12 inch long piece of pinewood in half. The motor Screamed, The studio fuses blew outand it concluded with smoke. End of saw. We did notkeep the original box and packing so I guess according to Amazonreturn policy we are stuck with it. Maybe I can create anassemblage sculpture with the remains."
4,GREAT BOOK!,"""The Cage"" written by Ruth Minsky Sender,was,I thought a very good book. It is about a girl who get seperated from her mother and father in the Holocaust. After she lost them she had to learn the responsibilities of a mother to take care of her younger brothers. The book really describes the living conditions and the things that they had to worry about while living in this ghetto. We dont have to worry about the food supply in our town soon running out. We dont have to worry about Nazi soliders coming and invading our homes looking for certain people of a certain religion. But these are only few of many things these people had to worry about. This girl, Riva, eventually gets split apart from her brothers and is to concentration camps. The camps that these people were sent to were too horrible to decribe. They could be described as a place of hell. If you take the time to read "" The Cage"" I know this book will keep you on the edge of your seat!"
3,Excellent Read,"I enjoyed reading this book. It was a quick read, I did it in one night. There were several typos in this book. However, I would still recommend it. I did, however, have a problem with the ending. The book ends so abruptly with no good details as to what happens to all the other people in the book. I feel a longer explanation would be nice, rather just one line saying everyone died. I can't help but wonder did she search for her brothers and mother? Did she search for her friends? How did she find out what happened to them? What made her go to America? How did she meet her husband? So many unanswered questions."
5,LOVE IT!,"I really, really loved this book! it was amazing! I have read it soo many times that the cover- well, you can't tell what it is supposed to look like! I would rate this book more than a 5 star... I would rate it seriously, about 100 star, that is how much I love the book."
5,Oster Size # 7 Skip Tooth Cryogen-X Blade w/ Agion Coating # 78919-056,thanks for FAST delivery of Oster Size # 7 Skip Tooth Cryogen-X Blade w/ Agion Coating # 78919-056 f
5,Tri State Killing Spree is the best of the old and the new..,"Tri State Killing Spree eptomize the best of a genre for me. The name is misleading, they're Gothic, wonderfully Gothic. The music is an amazing blend of deeply melancholy lyrics and stunning electric violin, layered with bass and keyboards that hit that place in your chest the electronic eighties used to. The sensually resonating vocals recall Bowie at his best. This music moves me!"
3,Mediocre,"I feel it is tight enough to be surrportive for my plantar fasciitis, but not irritating like other arch wraps. Does not feel as supportive as taping does but is much more convenient to use. Easy wear, tough, quality construction."
2,Not tight enough,"This may work for people with wider feet, but it doesn't seem to give enough tight support to a narrow foot."
3,Plantar Fasciitis,Great for walking around to lift the arch and ease the pain associated with Plantar Fasciitis. A little uncomfortable to run while wearing the Arch Bandage.
5,Amazed,"I was surprised a bandage this thin would have so much support. I am very pleased with this product, and I wear it everyday."
5,these things are for sale!,"I got slammed with the plantar F and with the help of searching the web for remedies, stretching, taking it easy, stop running till it heals and wearing one of these elastic bands around my foot and also avoiding a dr. whom would probably prescribe some goofy shoe inserts and basically managing my malady instead of curing it, ie. bill my insurance.... Before getting the arch bandage I wrapped duct tape around my sock moderately tight but not too...a tip I picked up on the web from a fellow sufferer. I work on my feet 12 hrs a day and this thingy really does make a difference, if it didn't I would not waste my time using it every day I work and is better and much easier to use than duct tape...but try the tape thing if you can't get your hands on one of these just yet...plantar F condition getting much better, day by day, hope to be back in running shoes in a month or so, i hope. ...don't forget to stretch!"
4,Not so Sure,"Prof. Bonilla - Silva definitely presents a view that is different than how people of non-color status view the world.His work has changed my view of prejudice. However, I do not completely agree with everything. It seems that hecontinues to blame non-blacks for the current situation that black people find themselves in. I believe people havea certain amount of personal responsibility. A person can take steps to change some things on their own. A goodread."
3,Valid points,"After reading some of the reviews for this book, I was looking forward to reading it.The data for this book come primarily from surveys of 627 college students, and 400 adults from the Detroit area and much of the book includes the verbatim responses of the survey participants. Although the author states that rhetorical incoherence is part of all natural speech, to read most of these answers is mind boggling. Not one person seems to be able to express themselves in a clear sentence without `um, I don't know, you know, I guess, it's like, you know'. It got so annoying, I ended up reading only the author's `Conclusion' at the end of each chapter.The book contains valid points and I don't mean to diminish the author's effort, but summarizing the survey answers in a clear way could have made this book easier to read and more effective."
3,Sweethearts Of The Twilight Lanes,"I just happened upon this book and thought it sounded interesting. I've never heard of this author before, but I'd thought I'd give her a try. I thought this book was ok. Tess is a very strong willed character who always has to be in control and Flynn is the troubled boy who breaks her heart and returns as a man. The sparks they have is intense filled with lots of sexual ribbing and jokes. Some of the dialogue was catchy and funny. When they finally get down and dirty after all the sexual teasing, it wasn't my favorite part in the book. There was a lot to lead up to it, but it kind of fell flat. I thought these two characters deserved a little more. It was a cute quick read, there were some parts filled with pages and pages of dialogue between two people and some pointless conversation and some things I felt that were repetead. Still, cute read. Heartwarming and made me smile at the end with some strong lasting friendships from the women this book centers around"
2,very disappointed by the quality,"Since many people wrote good reviews on this product, I bought it for my 15months old baby. However, I am very disappointed by the quality of play toy because the paint comes off and also a lot of splinters on the wood surface, which would not be safe for my baby. I returned the product. I noticed a lot of plan toy does not have good quality. not smooth surface, a lot of splinters, and paint comes off."
4,My daughter loves this stable.,This is a fairly large sized stable and the corral is excellent. There are several doors and a removable inner loft with ladder. My daughter currently enjoys using it as a house for her favorite stuffed dogs and their puppies. It has seen many hours of play time.
3,Careful.....not the complete song!,"I have been searching for this particular song for a awhile. I know it is from the album ""La Patata"". Figured this single CD was a great find, but it turns out that it is the ""Euro"" version which is much shorter than the original song. Oh well...the package did arrive much earlier than expected and was in good condition. That is the only reason it is getting three stars."
5,FUN!!,"These buttons were a for a gift I was making and they were a hit! What fun, so many uses! Well worth the money."
3,Recorder,Cute recorder for making stuffed animals come to life. I recorded my dog barking and placed it in a stuffed bear.
4,purchaser,"I ordered one item, and was sent another, due to out of stock issue. The person who asked if that would be okay was very pleasant. As it turns out, the person for whom the item was ordered ended up in a facility, and the item was never used. This all happened within two weeks. I need to return it....can anyone help me with this? A call was made to the supplier, to no satisfaction. I imagine the item is fine....it looked fine...the rating doesn't apply....it was not used."
5,Love it!,Bought with the Magic Garden Sheet Set. The comforter tore first time it was washed and had to be sewn back together. Has been fine in subsequent washings. I think it had a lose thread that I shoudl have looked for first. The inside of the comforter did not bunch when washed which was a concern of mine.
2,didnt work,product looked good and price was right but after all the trouble instaloling it it would only move outwards and the other three positions did not move. ended up having to take and use old mirrror and put the 2 togerther to get one to work. could have sent it back but really wanted a mirror on my truck and workd fine after combing the two to make one but not overly thrilled about this product
1,No go for usb iPad adapter,Wanted to connect an AT2020 usb mic to a standard apple usb 30 pin cable. Did not work for this application. Guess I'll try apple connection kit or other 3rd party device.
3,DVD review,"I thought it was a compilation of his shows, but it was one live show with the Osmonds and some other guests. It was good, but not what I was expecting."
1,The Book Does Not Deliver,"As the title suggests, we are meant to see the ""Hand Behind the Magic"" and yet we do not see enough artwork to visualize anything; in fact most of the pages are almost blank. Content on Ariel is appalingly short, considering that she is the main character. There are no preconsception sketches that show the develoment of the character, absolutely nothing that answers ""How do they do it?"" question suggested by the title. Colour plates are nice, but far inbetween. Anyone, who is looking for inspiration will be severly disappointed."
3,Good but not great,"The introduction to Islam makes this book worth the money. In fact, one Muslim I know of said that Abdul Saleeb (pseudonym meaning, ""Servant of the Cross"") was obviously a current Muslim, not a former Muslim, since no one else could show such understanding of Islam. Therefore, he claimed, the publishing company must have approached a Muslim and lied about the project to get him to write the intro. :)There are a fairly large number of typos in this book. The biggest flaw, though, is Geisler's tendency to ""shoot from the hip"" and repeat himself. He will often say, ""The noted Muslim Scholar Abdullah Yusuf Ali..."" and then say the same thing on the next page, word for word. He uses quotes several times as those unaware of it, and he generalizes far too much.This book, though good, should only be used if you have a fair amount of knowledge of apologetics already."
3,exotericism vs. esotericism,"OK, I was forced by the ""machine"" to click on some stars, but I have not read this book, so it's not fair to write a review for it (it sounds very interesting though), but let me suggest that readers interested in this debate also read something deeper than mere religious apologetics, and get Frithjof Schuon's ""Understanding Islam"" or his ""Christianity/Islam - Essays on Esoteric Ecumenicism"". Another fine book written by a Westerner who truly understands Islam is the concise ""Sufism"", by William Stoddart. Religion - on its own level - has every right to oppose other religions (on pains of losing its own identity and efficacy) or even defend itself against them if need be, so if one is looking for harmony and peace between peoples one must needs procure the deeper principles by which every exotericism [outward religious form] may be transcended. Try the suggested reading - you'll feel it is most rewarding."
1,hate crusade,"I feel that christians and muslims will agree that this is a very negative view of Islam, many twisted and distorted claims are made and I feel that the writer has some sort of secret vendetta against muslims... Muslims and christians are both ""people of the book"" and should live peacefully and love each other, not creat hate crusades against each other. The muslims and christians are all children of abraham... I say don't waste your money on such propaganda trash."
1,Insinuated Hate,"I still can't believe some people are actually praising this book... After all, an answer to 'Answering Islam' has already been written, and it makes the 'arguments' in this 'book' sound like half-baked childish attempts to libel Islam. I imagine you can make lots of money preying on people's belief, especially with such a sensitive issue as religions. It's funny how people like the author try to attack Islam in every way possible, forgetting the old adage about not casting stones when you live in glass houses. Hmmm, so who's on the right path now, is it Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, or Judeo-Chrisitians? they're all right and everybody else is a savage, how sad is the state of a religion when it reaches that level of self-righteousness?"
4,Keeping the spare tire dry and clean,"Be patient, tugging here and pulling thereand it will finally fit just fine.I suggest fitting the cover on a warmer daywhich will minimize much of the above."
5,Surprisingly nice,"Very impressed with the cover. Looks great, fits tire snug and is pretty high quality for the price. Great purchase for $17."
4,Seems to work well - won't know how well until items are removed. :-),"I used it on a recent spark plug install and I guess it will work OK. Well, it was a little messy going on and I didn't have any trouble with the install. But, I really won't know how well it works until I remove the plugs - hopefully, years from now. :-D So, maybe Amazon will still be around by then and I can give an update when that happens. Either it works or it don't - we'll see. :-)"
4,Reviews from Brizmus Blogs Books,"This book was a great look at what it must have been like for an American woman to be living in Japan during the Vietnam war. It was touching and heartwarming, and I managed to basically adore it despite not really liking the two main characters. I think that's saying a lot.Throughout the book, we really come to understand the characters and what it feels to live in a country that does not understand or really accept you. It is beautifully written and engaging; even in just the way it is written, with smooth, flowing dialogue and description, the reader comes to understand what it must be like to be immersed in Japan and Japanese thought."
1,Very disappointed,"We bought this as a replacement wall charger for one of our phones, an LG CG225 (der). This phone in general is giving us the WORST service. For nearly 2 weeks the phone has not been charging. We bought a replacement charger on eBay and it didn't fit. The sellers did not respond.We bought this set also to give it a shot. We'd have bought it @ the AT&T; store but they just do not have it available. Anyways, the wall charger simply does not work. I understand the item is inexpensive but come on... 3 bad chargers. We even got a replacement phone and still nothing.I highly recommend avoiding this phone / charger if you can.On the bright side we got the broken item very fast. Whoppie."
1,horrible and waste of money,"As a practicing Taoist, I find this book very silly and just a book to appeal to a christian whom is disatisfied being a christian...As a Taoist I find christianity does not relate and the thinking is primitive...why do christians have to bother with other peoples views if their religion ""worked"" for them to begin with..study on this..."
3,Disappointed,I bought this thinking that there would be more spanish words. There were just a few and the rest was in English. Not what I expected.
3,Love Is Key with Marlon D.,I thought that I was getting the song Usted Abuso with La India and Marlon but it was never on that cd. All the other songs were ok.
3,Not his best work,"Gerald Petievich's ""To Die in Beverly Hills"" is not one of his best works of writing. But it does have some strong points.As can be expected, it is about the Secret Service. (Mr. Petievich is a former agent and uses this past experience to his advantage).The problem with the book is that it is a very predictable. It was written almost as if he was rushed to write ""something"". He is a very detailed orientated writer but it wasn't used to its fullest in this book.He hasn't written a book since 1991 but I do hope he writes a new book soon!"
3,Good Insight - Bad Language,"I agree that this book provides a much needed voice.Learning disabilities are explained from the perspectiveof two young men who actually lived the experience, ratherthan the usual detatached clinical view. But the use ofexpletives in this book - right from the start - limits its appeal. What a shame. A young child who is struggling withreading could really relate to the authors' true-to-lifegrade school ordeals. But the use of the f-word makes itundesirable as a reference. I found much of the language to be gratuitous."
3,Why all the swearing?,"I haven't read this book, I was thinking about buying it and read the excerpt online. It might be great, but I wouldn't want my kid reading any book with the ""F"" word on every page. I think it's unfortunate. Just my opinion."
5,Simply Magnificent!,"This is one of the (if not THE) best, well-rounded classical CDs ever made. It is great for anyone that is just being introduced to classical music, because they will probably have heard some of the songs on here. Also, this CD is great for classical music lovers, as it is a good mix of their favorite songs. I'm 13, and own a few other classical CDs, but this one will always stand out above the rest. It is also a bargain price for 2, absolutely jam-packed (77min. each!) CDs."
4,Nice book.,"My 2 year old likes it. My kid does not tear up paper, but still it handles her rough handling pretty well. The pictures are clear, the colors are nice, the letters and numbers are big enough and the choices of items illustrated are nice."
4,MY FIRST BOOK,"EL BEBE DISFRUTA MUCHO CUANDO JUGAMOS CON ESTE LIBRO, CON EL PODEMOS COMPARAR, IDENTIFICAR, SE√ëALAR Y DESCUBRIR, CADA VEZ QUE LO TENEMOS PODEMOS INVENTAR UN JUEGO DIFERENTE. NOS GUSTA MUCHO A LOS DOS"
3,Smaller than I thought and outdated...,This book is very small. I thought it was a lot bigger. My daughter likes to look through it sometimes but I think it could have bigger pictures. The pictures also look like they're from the early 90s so it looks a little outdated...
3,Great for instruction regarding the Meaning of Qi Gong,"Although this is a VHS Tape and not a book, I thought that it was very instructional for the Meaning of Qi Gong. The tape gives you great insight about what benefits there are with these exercises, and makes you want to start today!The main thing missing though, is any exercises! I thought that I was purchasing a Qi Gong Video, showing ""beginner's"" exercise regimen, but there are only samples. I would like this tape a whole lot more if there was those exercises!Now to hunt for the tape with the exercises on it! HELP!!!!"
1,Not what it seems!,A couple of good songs to lure you into buying it. They are not all that great and plus it is not mixed from one song to the next. They all seem to have an abrupt ending before the next song.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"For Robert Anton Wilson, this book is a little more straightforward. Adistant relative of Habard Celine encounters yet another conspiracy. Iknow, that is a real shocker in an Illuminati book, not. One of those'chance meetings in a tavern, now we have a fantasy adventure' typescenarios occur.The interesting thing is that our conspiratorial protagonistencounters Albert Einstein and James Joyce, and they attempt to puttheir intellects to the task of working out what is going on."
4,"Remembering Charlotte: Postcards from a New South City, 1905","A showcase of early century postcards featuring the Historic Architecture of Charlotte, NC. This book is great for history buffs and postcard aficionados alike. It chronicles, in photographs, the urban development of a southern town, and the subsequent demolition of that town to make room for the emerging city development. Sadly some beautiful buildings and homes were destroyed in the process. ""Remembering Charlotte"" does a wonderful job of resurrecting those structures once more."
4,Easy to install - Built Well - Looks Great,"This TV mount is one of the best i have seen, a lot better then products you can buy at BB or CC. It was easy to install and provides a lot of flexibility in TV positioning."
5,Great gift,This made a great gift for a dear friend that loves puzzles and wine. It fit the wine bottle perfectly and did not disappoint in the fun department.
5,Great Gift,"I love this item, Great for referral Gifts. I have been giving Don't Break the Bottle for many years and plan too for many more."
3,"Comfortable Shower, Cheap Plastic Housing","I have owned many speakman shower heads over the years and always find them to provide the most comfortable showers. I bought this for a guest bath and expected the same level of construction that I have found in my other speakman purchases. I was very surprised to find that the outer housing of this shower head is made of plastic with a cheap chrome-like finish. While the internal components are made of brass (as advertised), I don't expect that this plastic shower head will provide the same durability as other solid brass speakman products. If you value durability, spend a few more dollars and step up to one of their higher-end products."
2,Don't bother,Not worth the money. It's a freakin' showerhead. Doesn't even focus spray well.Doubt I'll buy another. Way over-rated. Go to Wallmart.
2,A good idea with a FATAL FLAW,"I'm a big fan of Topeak's gear. I own two of their racks, couple of pumps, bags, etc. I use the MTX trunk bag/panniers to commute, and I live in Florida so I needed rain cover. I purchased this, and to my surprise----Topeak failed to include a strap for a rear blinkie. Yes, the cover is yellow. Yes, there's a reflective triangle. But that's not the same as a blinkie. Gee, Topeak, do you think people might want to run a blinkie in the rain? Stupid lack of planning."
1,Not very entertaining,"My son received this bulldozer as a gift. It holds his a attention for all of two minutes, and mine, as long as it is turned on! It is very noisy, and annoying at that. it makes that beeping sound you hear when a truck is backing up. The tracks come off very easily, which further frustrates my 2 year old son. The only good thing I can say about it is it has a switch you can turn it off with underneath that my son has yet to figure out, so I can tell him it needs to take a nap when I have had enough."
2,Noisy and weak!,I can't recommend this toy. It makes so much noise that you won't want your kids to play with it. They may give up anyway since the toy has no power and moves very slowly. It can't push blocks inside and forget about the sandbox! Buy a non-motorized toy that the kids can't break and can move around as fast or slow as they want.
2,Thought it was made in America...,"Did a little research on this a nd kept finding that it was made in ""North America"". Not that I'm hating on foriegn made products, but it's what I wanted. When I opened the box (appeared factory sealed) the pump was wraped in a bunch of asian newspapers. Pump is installed on a '97 TJ 4.0L."
2,Much better cookie books out there,"I picked this book up at a store and ended up returning it. Some cute ideas but was disappointed by the many recipes that started with cake mixes. Tried the witches' broomstick cookie, cute but not a great tasting cookie. If you really like to bake cookies there are much better books out there."
1,"So cute, but so disappointed!","My son really wanted these, so I bought the hornet pair as part of his birthday present. He was so excited to try them on, only to find out that they didn't fit his 4 year old head. They were too tight and he started to cry because he tried to jam them on his little face. The little lenses on the inside fell out after about 2 days (my son was still trying them, hoping they would fit). Such a huge disappointment, as I expect better quality from a good company like Insect Lore."
1,"Forget the Rabbit, buy Le Creuset","I bought a plain rabbit a couple of years ago, and though i liked it, it did, at times, take a lot of strength to get a cork out. Then it broke in the sense that it would pull the cork, but not take the cork out of the corkscrew afterward. So I went shopping for a new rabbit, and read a featured review quoting bad experience (not unlike mine) and recommending the le Creuset ""screwpull"". Though it cost more, I did buy the Le Creuset, and love it. It is way easier to pull any cork than the Rabbit ever was!"
5,Great indoor soccer ball.,This ball held up well to regular heavy use in our church gym (traditional gym floor). To the point that a year later it had some of the felt wearing off but still held it's pressure and only needing air added once during that time. Priced right and durable. I recommend.
5,Awesome Rock masterpiece!,"This new powerhouse CD, ""All The Thrills and Pageantry"" shows why this band has been called the greatest rock and roll band in the world! If you don't love the HoTTENToTS, you don't rock. CONTENTS: 1) Little Boys Playin' With Guns 2) Disillusioned 3) Robin Flew Off the Handle 4) Ah Healin' Mutha Hunchie Tent Show From God 5) Say...That's New 6) L.U.V. 7) Herpes Aids Cusp 8) Sammy 9) Drug War 10) Let Me Entertain You 11) The Vulture 12) Elvis has Left the Building"
1,I don't get it,"I patiently listened a few times a few months ago: I didn't get it.I listened again recently: I still don't get it.I will listen again and again in the future (But I'm listening, I'm sure, because of Coltrane's name.) I don't think I will get it then, either.It just doesn't sound like music."
4,Works as expetced,"I got this package in good time which I appreciate. The devise also works as I would have expected it to, which is the most important thing in my book. I would buy from this seller again."
1,Only remote...so...you're stuck with it...,"Why 1 star? Because you need it. Otherwise you can not use DVDs on your X-Box. I do not understand how Microsoft can release such a simple remote. This isn't a remote control, it's a toy that belongs with the likes of Little Tikes. Remote controls represent manhood, this item represents Happy Meals.Look at Sony's ""official"" remote control for the PS2. Look at the button options. Why did Microsoft feel that they should produce such a simple product? Onscreen menus instead of button selections?I feel cheated. I even called the X-Box help desk and inquired about a good remote control and was treated with: ""That is the final product. There will be no other option. Maybe a second generation company will produce one you are satisfied with."""
1,dvd playback kit,"We never received the dvd playback kit and are very disappointed that Amazon would deal with a vendor that is not reputable. My son has anxiously been awaiting this kit. At this point it has become apparent that we were ripped off. :(Sincerely,Paula Pettis"
5,Very convenient,It enhances the XBMC experience! I would recommend it to anyone looking to set up a media center using the original XBOX. Definitely good buy!
3,Play back kit,"Functions as described. It would be handy to have the remote LEARN controls of the TV. Oh Well, can't have everything... where would ya put it?"
3,a must if you dont have a dvd but not so good if you do,"my dvd is old and doesnt play burnt vcds. i bought the kit cause i thought that it'll play burnt vcds like any modern dvd player. to my disappointment, it didnt.i may be wrong about this but i think that the xbox isnt meant for dolby digital 5.1 and so, the kit also doesnt support 5.1 speakers. i think that the xbox's is only in stereo because of the cables it connects with to the television. if im wrong please email me. the 5.1 soundtrack that dvds have is really important (it sets them apart from the laser disks)."
3,These aren't quite as good as the manufacturer's,"These cut okay, but not as well as the ones that I get from the manufacturer. I was a little disappointed, but they still do the job."
2,"WARNING, Oaster is good,miAco is not","I ordered this replacement blade assuming a OEM (original equipment from manufacturer) from Oaster and received and alternate brand called miAco that performed poorly. I have been shaving my Labrador monthly for a year and a half with the Oaster A5 clippers. I have been very happy with the A5. The blade has finally dulled enough for the need to replace it as they all do with use. this non OEM replacement was poor at cutting right out of the box because it could not ""comb"" through the thick fine hair and cut it. Its performance seemed to worsen as I was near the end of cutting my dogs fur. I will not use this blade a second time an need to want to buy an OEM replacement."
5,book,"The book was not about the race horse Tom Fool as I thought it would be, but it came in very good condition, the price of book and shipping was great, and I will still enjoy reading it."
5,I have two and both work great.,I bought two of these scales and both are very accurate which was confirmed by our last pinewood derby official scales... If you need one to weigh something small I don't think you can go wrong with this scale.
4,Triton T2 Review,"I bought this to weigh dye for fabric dyeing. I've only used it a few times but, judging from the colors I'm getting, it appears to be accurate. It's also easy to use. I calibrated it initially with 2 100-gram weights and have then used it without recalibration. I can't vouch for its longevity since I've only had it for a short time, but so far, so good."
5,Does what it's designed to do,"This scale does exactly what it's designed to do: weigh small compact items with a decent resolution. I purchased it to weigh smaller jewelry items and stones. It works well, and I like the roughly 6""x3"" compact size, and the different display measurements. The operation couldn't be simpler. If you want to weigh large amounts of oregano then I recommend you look for some other scales..."
1,Beautiful Garbage,"I'm glad that guy's kids loved the game. He's a rare case. Shame on Microsoft for allowing such a piece of garbage into it's launch lineup. The only purpose this game served is to show off the graphical power of the X-box.I use this game to give visitors a quick overview of X-box graphics. Then I pop in Halo, Project Gotham, or Oddworld."
1,Crude and Complicated,"I got the game for christmas and it looked like a lot of fun, but it turned out to be crude with passing gas and burping i've never seen anything like it so i sold mine to a game store in my area if i could give it 0 stars i would it turned out to be so complicated you couldn't understand what they wanted you to do I don't reccomend this game to anyone (made for children too complicated for adults)*DON'T BUY THIS GAME*"
3,It's a place to start.,"I've lived in the Seattle area almost all my life. I spent 10 years working in downtown. I feel I really know the area. However, in looking for a book to give me ideas of what to do with my kids playing tourist in Seattle this one didn't help. I'm now looking for another book to inspire me in planning out a full week. If you were a kid from out of state wondering what your parents were getting you in for, this book would be okay. Other than that, it's not really that helpful in planning a vacation."
3,Holiday on the Buses,"Stan and Jack get fired from the bus depot and decide to go and work as a bus crew for a holiday resort. The family of course decide to go on holiday with hilarious results. This was the last of three films made of the popular British television series. Stars Reg Varney, Doris Hare, Stanley Lewis et al. A good buy if you prefer British humour."
2,HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES,"Holiday On The Buses was the second film to be adapted from the popular British sitcom. This time it's set on a typically English holiday camp and all the double entrendes and comic misunderstandings makes very predictable viewing. Reg varney and the cast are all likeable in their flamboyantly exagerated characterisations but this is just like most other movies to be adapted from a television series. Interest wanes after about 25 minutes - normally the running time of a standard episode of the series, so this just seems like one ponderous extended t.v sketch. To be fair though there are some laughs along the way with Anna karen as Olive, always providing the funniest moments. Unfortunatley though the whole film seems quite dated now and was obviously very cheaply made. fans of the series will love this. If you've never even heard of the series though there is little to recommend apart from the fairly likeable albeit caricture performances. Typical British 1970's vehicle."
5,Wow,"In his final years, Coltrane became heavily influenced by the music of the jazz avant-garde. A few short months before his death, Coltrane recorded the work which was to become the album Interstellar Space.Interstellar Space is not for the beginner jazz listener. Admittedly, the first time I listened to it, I wasn't sure what to make of it. But after listening to it several times, I am completely amazed at how powerful it is. I still cannot believe Coltrane's intense and powerful sax playing and Rashied Ali's frenetic and thunderous drumming, especially on the first track Mars. I am literally exhausted after hearing this album.If you're looking for something challenging to listen to and not just the usual jazz, then this album's for you."
4,"not required, but useful","This is good for traveling around and if you are moving, or taking it to a friends house or in my case if you are better than all your friends at xbox, you can let them borrow your memory card while you just save your game on the xbox, or if you do codes but you still want to do the regular game you can save the codes on the memory card and save the real game to the hard drive."
3,Don't really need one,Having grown up on Nintendo and Playstation I automatically bought a memory unit for the XBox. You don't need one unless you plan to save games and go to a buddies house. I play only at home and really didn't need this capability. Get Xbox live while you're at it too.
2,"Lame, Lame, Lame","You'd think a movie with four monkeys in it would be good, but even the monkeys suck. The only good parts are Yvette Mimieux and Maurice Chevalier. And Dean Jones is totally unappealing, especially opposite Ms. Mimieux. Dream on."
3,Oh Donna!,"This is an early cd of the Palast Orchester, and has lots of music from other cds we own, but again is much fun to listen to."
4,Decent Controller,"The Xbox controller is big, bulky, and it takes getting used to. I have big hands so its pretty comfortable for me, but I would not reccomend this controller for little kids.The controller is a high quality product, and was built with the input of hundreds of gamers. The button placement is adequate, but people with smaller hands will find themselves stretching to reach some of the buttons.This is the default controller that comes with the Xbox system, and is not by any means a bad controller. But..I would reccomend the XBox controller S, which is great for smaller hands AND big hands. It's also made by Microsoft so you can expect a quality product."
3,xBox is ok.. but they made a huge mistake,well i got my hands on both the gamecube and xbox today.. and they both have ups and downs..the xbox pumps out some seriously pretty graphics and runs pretty damn smooth.. however.. the controller is the worst design ever for a console. its too freakin big and REALLY uncomfortable.. i mean im 23 and i have average sized hands.. god save the children that will try and play it...its also rumored that the xbox has hardware issues..but i saw none..now the gamecube has the BEST controller on any console.. the thing fits like a glove... it just doesnt have the hardware or the software ( yet) to compete with the Box.my final word : im getting the gamecube before the xbox..because i WILL NOT buy that system with the current controller.. stupid stupid microsoft
2,nice but there are nicer one`s that are cheeper too!!!!,"this is not i nice controller for a few reasons, the first is the buttons areclose together! you do`t want to hit the wrong key when you are play a fast paced game! the second and last reason is it doesn`t fell to great in your hand! get the mad catz controller like i did for ($)it feels great and the buttons are spaced farther apart to a good distance and they arn`t too far scaped ither."
3,X BOX,This controller looks cool. BUt is way too big and too many d-pads. It is very handy and sensitive for smooth gameplays. But still is too big.
4,"If youve played a dreamcast, this controllers no problem.","When I got this controller i thought ""Great, a controller thats [no good]."" I was verry surprised that it was verry similar to the dreamcast. All in all its pretty chuncky but one [heck] of a lot better than the other controllers for the XBox. Of course, I allways prefer a medium sized controler so that also effects my opinion. My freind hates it though because he likes the smaller controllers like the playstation or gamecube controllers. I would give this 4 1/4 stars if that was possible."
1,man! what were they thinkin,"that stupid contorller is soo big, it wont fit anywhere. trust me like my review on the system, you dont want it. stick with computers microsoft."
2,STINKS,"To begin, this controller is HUGE. Its WAY to big for me or any of my friends. The stupid XBOX symbol in the middle takes half of the space away, and thats why the buttons are too close to eachother. Also, ur right thumb kills when u try to reach for that d-pad at the bottom. Microsoft did a terrible job. You should get a controll S."
3,It's a good controller but get the controller S,I played with this controller at my friends house and it isn't to big! Everyone says its to big but Its a fine controller. The only problem is the Y button because I have to look down to make shure I didn't hit the Black button. (this is why I recomend the controller S) Trust me this controller is fine but beware the Y button!Also for gamecube players the B button is In the opposit place of were is is on the gamecube controller! (see picture)
2,its nice to hold but not to play,at first when i gripped on to the controller i thought that microsoft might of done it. But for example when your playing tony hawk 2x you need to be able to get around the buttons fast but when going from allie to grind you hit the other buttons due to the wierd of center design and there two close. I like the rumble and the analogs and the way it looks but basic playablity is the number one factor.
2,XBOX CONTROLLER,"This controller is way too big and from everyone elses reviews I can see why the world see's us American's as ego trippers. I play basketbal and I'm 15, I have big hands because I've been able to hold the ball in one hand since I was 11. I still think the controller is too big, it gives me cramps, and for this reason I can only play my xbox for limited times. On the other hand I find the gamecube standard controller not quite right either, but the wave bird, looks really bad, but for me plays perfect."
1,Pure Junk!,Well it only took a few months before 2 switches failed and one was DOA. Don't waste your money...go elsewhere...
1,Noisy Trimmer,"When i got the set i was happy to see that the set was made in USA, but i was dissapointed after my first use small trimmer is to loud!!! They cut as it is described but would not recommend it."
2,A Uruguayan Fab 4 they ain't!,"Actually there is only one cover in this compilation, Del Shannon's ""Keep Searchin'"" which is pretty decent only because it's a great song. The rest of the tracks are fairly mediocre attempts at capturing some Beatles' magic. None of the tunes comes close to achieving this.Perhaps the compilation suggested by the previous reviewer is better. I doubt whether it could be any less exciting."
4,Computers for Dummies,"Book was fine but took to long to get, but that is the postal service for you!!"
3,Hard Boiled Block,"SMAD is an early Block work. In it, the development of his sparse writing style, quick turning plots, and complex alienated protagonist is already well formed. The plot seems a bit far-fetched but he has great fun with it it as the ball starts rolling.This is a work for fans who want to see the early Block in action. His later works are vastly better developed and more sophisticated. That said, it is interesting to see what he was like in his early days. If you like reading some of Ed McBain's early 87th Precinct novels and seeing how his work developed, you'll get the same sort of kick here.If you're new to Block, go pick up 'Like a Lamb to the Slaughter', 'Eight Million Ways to Die', or 'When the Sacred Ginmill Closes'. These are all works of true refinement in the crime genre."
2,I was disapointed,"Usually I give a whole CD a true chance, especially if it from a caliber like Russel Allen. Especially since Symphony X is one of my favorite bands to listen to. I listened to 5 songs and took the CD out and won't listen to it anymore. Russel has a unique and well trained voice but he did not show his true potential. He sounded more ordinary than interesting. I didn't feel it at all.Hope the next one will be better.Alex"
2,Good Camera - Poor Range,"Excelletn night vision capabilities, but it doesn't work well through even a couple of walls with out a lot of static.The pan and tilt feature works well."
1,Useless,"This is my first monitor camera (and my first baby). After 15 days of use I have to admit my mistake with the characteristics I chose to select this product.First of all, PAN camera is a gadget more than a useful product to monitor baby.- The signal of the camera is interfered for any 2.4Ghz phone or WiFi network. The interfence is so deep you have to mute the receiver.- Brick walls reduce the signal power, reducing the distance of use to a less than 6 meters. After that the noise in audio make it useless.I have 2 2.4Ghz phones, and a 802.11g network. I have to decide between them, so I prefer to turn this monitor off.I don't return this products, because I live outside EEUU."
1,A biased conclusion from a mioptic view of new age movement,"The author apparently injured his mind's ability, by his own admission of misuse of drugs, resulting in him terrorizing himself by an episode with a formless psychic ""blackness"". Incapacitated by terror for a week, he turned to christianity to allay his fears. With a vigor often found in ""new born"" christians, he zealously attacks fringe elements of the new age movement portraying them as typical of all aspects of the movement,condemns them with simplistic enterpretations from carefully selected bibilical exerpts and judges the whole new age movement wanting. This reviewer wishs him psychic healing from his christian balm; but also wishs a less biased and simplistic judgement of the new age which doesn't focus on the bible as the only true guide to spiritual evolution. There are many other equally valid sources of truth."
4,Very Good for Embellishment Work for Pillows,"This book is really what you need ifyou enjoy, as I do, making pillows really special. There are techniques for rope cording, fabric cording, tassels in pillows with corded trim, box pillows, yarn fringe, etc. I only gave it 4 stars because I wish there were more pictures with descriptions, as being a relative novice, I needed more explanation. However, you can get the hang of it pretty well with the pictures that are supplied. This is a great reference book for your sewing library."
1,It does not fit!,"This hose does not fit my 1997 Chevrolet Tahoe as it is advertise! it needs at least 3 more inches, looks like I was ripped off...."
5,"A ""Must Have"" alphabet book","Charley's alphabet approaches the first day of school in time to ""help a child learn the a-b-c's."" However, along the way there are some mishaps and confusions that require sifting and sorting, searching, and trying again until words are formed and learned. This book is not only a wonderful alphabet book for children, it is also a view of the reading process for teachers. Alphabet Adventure is a delight of vibrant colors that cascade the pages of this book. The carefully written story invites inquiry and higher level thinking. The language and illustraions provide opportunities for not only enjoying the story, but for conversation between parent and child, teachers and children. I love alphabet books and was so delighted to find this book that I bought two. It is a ""must have"" book for Kindergarten and first grade teachers. Parents and grandparents need to share with young children as well."
3,Bright colorful illustrations,"Illustrations in this book are bright and colorful, cute story, however, my children aren't that interested in it. Children ages 5, 4, 2 1/2, 16 months."
