2,Old School... and not in the best way,"Packaging for this product is problematic and the production value of the discs is ridiculously low. Considering how cheap the set was, there isn't a LOT to complain about. The master copies must have been degraded VHS tapes. The episodes aren't in order by season and there are no bonuses of any sort."
2,Cheaply made set,"I watched the Ray Bradbury Theater growing up and really wanted a hard copy of the series. I was very excited to find it on Amazon, but once it arrived, I was highly disappointed. The way the series is set up, from the packaging, to the menus on the individual discs, to the crummy appearance and lack of remastering makes the whole thing look like a crummy bootleg. I actually looked the series set up online to make sure it was licensed set and not just that someone burned the episodes from their VHS to a dvd. But unfortunately, that is the quality you get to look forward to with this set. The audio on the playback is sometimes low with a hum in the background and there is no option of closed captioning or subtitles. The picture, while cleaned up a bit, still looks grainy. And mind you, all of this is from a CRT. I couldn't imagine trying to watch this particular dvd series on a 1080p or even 720p."
1,Soooo Disappointed!,"I had a KRUPS 2-waffle belgium waffle maker and loved it. Flat wore it out. By the time I was ready to get another, I was ready for a four-waffle maker. AFter reading the reviews, chose this one. The thing is a pain to clean up, and the waffles are soggy. Only way to get a crisp waffle out of this is to burn them. Used it twice and threw it away."
2,love songs I still like to hear,"this was a good collection containing both often and less often heard songs. This is great for listening in the car , especially in bad traffic."
3,Great Settings and Scenes,"I look back at this book and think that I read it when I was too young to understand it. The sensory elements of the work are easy to grasp, but the broader questions about family and colonialism and place are ones that I failed to know several years ago as well (maybe?) as I do now. This is a extremely worthwhile read."
1,Don't believe this singer is George Jones,We are avid fans of Jones and If this is him singing I am very disapointed in him for recording such good songs on such a poor quality tape. Surely he doesn't need the money this badly. I will say I learned my lesson about buying cheap tapes. His picture on the front is misleading . I will be very careful in the future about buying tapes by this company .
3,Calico Critters,"These are VERY cute, but WAY smaller than I thought they'd be. It said they were 6""+, but it turns out that was the size of the box - the critters are only about 2"". They don't stand up very well. So, to me, they are more just a cute little 'trinket' than they are something to play house with. I didn't feel like I got much for over $22, but I suppose there is more there than it seems, when you take into account the clothes etc."
2,terrible writing.....,I couldn't finish it. The dialogue and writing was very childish. I have no idea why this book has almost 5 star reviews.
5,I Couldn't Take My Eyes Off It !!,"If you like exciting,breathtaking books,you should read the Adventures of Jecosan Tarres.It is written by Laura Lond.Jeco goes through some wild experiences with his dog Bart, and his friend Dalian. This is only book one of three! Book two comes out by Christmas 2003.My mom and I have both finished the book.[I beat her to finish too!]If you don't like this book I must be crazy because it's the best book I've ever read!"
2,Great song selections marred by TERRIBLE monophonic sound quality!,"&#2951; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:&#1150;&#1150; Not recommended. This product gives me cold pricklies.I have been a HUGE fan of the Cab since the early 80s, and I currently have over 25 of their CDs, including this one. But as much as I love the selection of songs on this CD, its muffled monophonic sound makes it a very frustrating listening experience. I have heard bootleg cassette tapes of live recordings made with a stereo microphone during the 1970s that sound better than this. Instead of getting this poor excuse for a live recording, get its equivalent DVD,Live at the Hacienda '83/'86(which I also have, and I like watching the corresponding DVD FAR BETTER than listening to this CD). This CD is essentially the audio portion of the DVD, and when you watch the DVD, you will be less distracted by the sound quality of the audio."
4,gavingia,"Love it. Do this with my mother in law. We both love it. Im 31 and she is 63. We both are just so amazed how this video works. I mean i love seeing big people work out it makes me say ""if they could do it i can too."" Its snowing out side and we can still walk in doors."
1,Product failure,"I have had two of these waffle irons. I agree with most of the comments made about this iron as far as its waffle making capabilities. BUT, I have had two of these irons just quit working or heating. They were never misused or abused or immersed or dropped...The first time Cuisinart replaced the defective one I had. Now, even though the warranty should still be in effect, they refuse to replace it. Both irons failed before 100 uses.Avoid!!!"
1,waffle sticker?,We have yet to get a waffle out in one piece. We end up with waffle bits. We have tried different settings and putting oil on the grid but to no avail. Our old one (Salton) never had this problem.
1,Didn't Work At All,"I can't really comment on the quality of waffles produced because the waffle iron I bought didn't work at all. Plugged it in .. nothing. Had to return it. It kind of surprised me that a company like Cusinart, that I have generally had a good experience with, would let a shoddy product like this get out."
3,Smells Like Mean Spirit/Smells Like Free Spirit,"This is an interesting two-fer for the time capsules. ""Wild in the Streets"" demonstrates directorial flair by Barry Shear. You will be in awe at how much he gets onto the screen with what was probably a minimal budget. The script has moments of brilliance but ultimately it struck me as nasty teen wish fullfillment. Great closing line, though. Not to be overlooked is a terrific Mann-Weill song score with ""Shape of Things to Come"" as a standout. Roger Corman's apocalyptic ""Gas-sss"" floats by on good vibes and an enthusiastic cast of youngsters. Sporting a Monkees-style script the jokes are hit or miss usually the latter but that's forgivable. Cindy Williams as a rock'n'roll lover and Ben Vereen as a genial Marxist are standouts. Terrific Southwest ambiance. View these flicks as products of their time that for the most part don't date very well."
1,Seriously disappointing,"Absoutely foul.... they stuck together, tasted like plastic, and even the strawberry ones in the pack didn't taste like normal Twizzlers. Avoid at ALL cost!"
1,"Voice quality, distance is poor",Have had this phone and four cordless extensions for well over a year. Am about to replace the whole system due to the poor voice quality. My Panasonic cordless in same home works almost flawlessly.
2,Phone does not perform in my home as well as others claim,"I reviewed all the 2 line phones I could and chose this cordless phone based on the reviews. I am very disappointed, the sound quality is poor and low, the reception is poor. I live in a two story frame and stucco home and the reception cuts out when I am on a different floor than the base even if I am directly under the base or in another room that is in an L shape from the base. The battery cover comes off easily. I am looking to replace the system."
1,Boring,"I read a positive review of this series and figured I'd like it. A strong, smart middle-aged heroine, Southern setting, a little bit of romance. Sadly, I was very disappointed. The writing was mediocre. I also found the privileged lives of Bay Tanner and her ""ladies who lunch"" friends to be extremely uninteresting. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters and gave up halfway through the book. Bay was far from a sassy no-nonsense heroine. She complained a lot, and seemed continually petulant. The kiss of death for me was the description of one of the (white) main characters as ""exotic,"" ""Oriental,"" with ""slanting eyes"" seemingly just because she has black hair. Oooh, black hair! Soooo exciting. What painfully boring lives these people live."
5,5 year old loves it!,"I bought this last Christmas, and my son still plays with it. I put it together in a snap. It really is not that hard. It is alot more durable than some of the Hotwheels track sets that I've seen. I set it up on the coffee table, and we race and race, to make things more interesting, I've thrown a few marbles on the tracks with the trains...what a hoot! This is not a pick up and drag around the house set, so it might be better for the older kids. I think the age should be above three. The little engines are tinier than the wooden engines, and it could be a choking hazard. At the end of the day, I put it away, and just wait for him to ask, and we set it up together. This ones a keeper for me."
4,Fun but easily destructible!,My 2 year old daughter loves this toy BUT it is a hourly search around the house for the parts. The support beams are her favorite to grab. She can disassemble this toy in one minute flat. It is cute and I love the idea but I doubt this will last long.
4,"B-Sides, Rarities, and Other Delights","You know, normally a CD collection of b-side and various band ephemera is another way of saying: give us your money. There is the occasional good collection (Suede's Sci-Fi Lullabies; The Smiths' Louder Than Bombs). Mostly, it's dross. But Fountains of Wayne's Out-of-State Plates is consistently good, better, I believe, than their first two records (though not Welcome Interstate Managers). Highlights abound, including a version of ""Baby One More Time"", the new songs that are here for bait, and a lovely experiment called ""Nightlight""."
5,whatever...,"I love how scenesters like to take what's good, compare it to something big, and then discard it as being a mock-up copy. I'm sure all the ""real"" outcasts in seattle know what I'm talking about. Not like those ""elitist"" outcasts that know everyone and their brother in the scene and decide what's cool and what's not.The Catheters on the other hand, rock like noone's business. A nice blend of Indie and RockNRoll. If you're looking for something like Murder City, look somewhere else, cause this isn't it."
3,Good but not great,"I must admit I saw this only after the HBO production of ""Sometimes in April"" and I found ""Hotel Rwanda"" to be lacking since it was aimed at making Americans too comfortable IMO.The trend in the film making communities of making hard issues palatable to general audiences is disturbing to me. The atrocities in Rwanda should not be trivialized and they should not make films like this to make people feel comfortable. In ""Hotel Rwanda"" we are give the story of a man who made a difference and that is wonderful. However, the way the UN and America turned it's back on the genocide that happened is played down greatly. I feel this is due to the need to make Americans comfortable, to make us not look at what we did to help the murders that happened.I am glad to see that this film has made more people aware of what happened in Rwanda. Maybe this will help us to not let it happen again."
3,"Important Story, Great Cast -- pity about the director","There is no doubting the importance the Rawandan Genocide and the western indifference. I feel that it is ironic that given the history, the immpeccable cast, the film was helmed by a tv director, and not a great one at that. Scenes became stagey, the artifice of the film's details constantly threaten the brutal drama that is unfolding. I cannot help but wonder how it might turn out with someone like Fernando ""Constant Gardener"" Meirelles, Steven ""Traffic"" Soderbergh, Spike Lee, Clark ""Boycott, The Shield, Sleeper Cell"" Johnson or a African director might do with materials like this.Now we need someone to make a film on the North American and European gov'ts inhuman machinery at work"
3,Important but unfortunate script,"If not for the point of the movie (killing innocent people is bad; let's all feel guilty about who allowed it to happen), the writing would openly be criticized. Someone suggested this is a ""Schindler's List"" of Rwanda. I disagree; Schindler's List was an excellent drama in every way; from music to writing to photography to acting. Hotel Rwanda falls short with canned writing and on-cue tear-jerking mediocre music.Hotel Rwanda almost succeeds in maintaining a degree of sobriety, and a mood of factuality in the dramatic events--and this is its strength and its originality.However, the script goes too fast to convey the plot's atrocious events, leaving the aftertaste of awkward melodrama. And to give another example. the happy ending is too fast and artificial. I could be much more critical; could go on.I especially felt bad for the actors, who have much greater talents than the limited script allowed."
5,"Oh, MY GOD","It is unbeliveably good and moving. I'm not gonna go into details since we know what the f*#$ happened. It's another ""Schindler's List"", but scary thing is it happened in our time. I'm a man, from Asia, and there are hardly any movies that made me cry, but this movie I was ""this"" close to cry to be honest with you. There were moments that tears filled my eyes, and I was also so mad at us as human beings. It is just impossible to imagine we can still kill each other off just because they were from different tribe. Oh, come on. We're the people of the 21st century, and we're still this stupid and that dumb? The actors did their best and they were terrific. By the way, if Jammie Fox wasn't there with his ""Ray"" at the Oscars Don Cheadle would've won with no doubt. I'll definetely buy this movie to show it to my kids when they are old enough that they can learn how we humans can make dumbe and cruel things. Don Cheadle you're my man. Best wishes for your career."
5,Oscar worthy performance by Don Cheadle,A hotel manager houses Tutsis refugees during their conflict with the Hutu militia. Heartwrenching performances and the overall message of bravery and courage were defined clearly by Mr. Don Cheadle. There is a definite lesson in this movie about giving of oneself and the testament of the human spirit. High recommend.
5,One of the best movies I have ever seen.,"I just saw Hotel Rwanda and was blown away... It is by far one of the best movies I have seen in my lifetime. It is a shame that so many have to find out the true story of what happened in Rwanda in the early 90's via a Hollywood movie, but this movie illustrates what happened there very well. Words honestly cannot describe this film in its entirety. Check this film out and you will not go wrong."
1,Why buy a bowl when the whole MACHINE is the same price?,"Yeah - I guess if you've got the Cuisinart ice cream maker it's a good idea to have an extra bowl. Yeah - this could also come in handy for other freezing uses in the kitchen. But - DUH! - why buy the bowl for thirty smackers when you can buy the whole (refurbished) ice cream maker (WHICH COMES WITH A NEW BOWL) on Amazon for the same exact price? Oh wait - I exaggerate - the bowl ALONE is 4 cents cheaper! If you REALLY want two bowls - buy the refurbished unit and get a whole extra machine - hell, you can always store the extra in your basement. Once again - DUH!"
2,Problem with the order.,"I ordered this product as a gift. It was stated that it was the ice cream maker with a ""bonus ice cream freezer bowl"". When it arrived - no bonus bowl was included. I sent an email which was not answered by the time I called Unbeatable Sale, Inc. After checking they said that they had made an error when they offered the bonus bowl. Instead of making it right and sending the bowl, they said I could send it back which of course I knew. It was a take it or leave it situation. As this was a gift for Christmas, I decided to keep it but I am not happy with this company. I don't know whether it makes good ice cream or not since I gave it away."
5,So many more uses!,"While I do have the ice cream maker, I ordered an additional freezer bowl to have on hand. It is helpful if you want to make two flavors of ice cream, or if you want to cool the warm custard for vanilla ice cream before you freeze it.I have also used this container to quickly cool items (like Jello which must be cooled for a mousse, raspberry mousse comes to mind :) in a metal bowl. Place any metal bowl on the top of this container. It will be stable and the bowl will get ice cold. The contents will then cool very quickly.Try this bowl to cool down custard when you are filling pastries. Just pour in the custard and stir with a spatula for a few minutes. Soon, you have creamy, cold custard to fill those pastries.I recommend keeping one of these in the freezer at all times. There are just so many more uses! Use it everytime you need to cool a liquid quickly. You will love the results.~The Rebecca Review"
4,A Fine Addition To Industrial Photography,"This is a wonderful book of photographs of the now-closed Bethlehem Steel plant in Bethlehem, PA. The first part of the book provides a history of the company and plant. Beautiful black and white photos complete the book. If you enjoy industrial photography in general, or steel mills in particular, you will appreciate this book. My only complaint is the book format size. There are so many details in each photograph that you really need a larger page size to fully appreciate the subject matter. The book is fairly priced and well-worth owning."
3,Home for my Female CT,"I originally bought this tank for my two CT males, Nico and Zazu, but it quickly became a pain. They could both see each other all the time and were always stressing each other out. Before I had funds available for a new tank for them it came down to ""modifying"" (essentially cutting up) the black plastic from a CD case to insert into one of the partitions to keep them from seeing each other.After I moved them to a different tank with a solid partition, I purchased a female CT who just loves it. She's small enough that she has plenty of room to swim around. I also have some tall grass in the tank which was made to fit by simply looping it throughout the tank and it's become a great little habitat for her.The tank is incredibly easy to clean and I don't have to worry about the lid falling off without warning.Recommended for 1 fish without the partition, but not for two.ALSO! Make sure to remove the fake plants. They will easily shear any fish' fins."
4,Great Piece of Music,Jerry Goldsmith was an incredible songsmith and this music was some of his best. I remember the original mini series and it was great. This cassestte brings it all back.
5,Best Wafflemaker ever,"After suffering the woes of other wafflemakers, I eventually threw away 5.....my husband was disgusted....The sunbeam maker only lasted 1 month...I've had this cuisinart now just over a year...and no matter how you like your waffles...this one will do it up right for you"
5,An amazing soundtrack in all respects...,"... despite that the film was a comedy, this is a serious musical composition work. The inspirations shine clearly through... from Gunsmoke composers Rex Koury and Glenn Spencer, to Enio Morricone soundtracks such as Theme from the Magnificent Seven. Nonetheless, the Soundtrack maintains plenty of valid originality that does justice to its influences. Well done."
3,Great for Beginning Cults & Solitary Practictioners,"This book has a lot of great Odinistic Rituals for many ""Holidays"", it is explains in depth Alters, and other paraphenilia used in the rituals of the Old Ways, although fairly contempary and ""Universal"" I can see a great ability to make strong Theodish Type Communities or ""Kinships"" with a fundemental and unified way of doing ritual ~smiles~, but as we all know rites and names varied from region to region ~smiles~"
2,A rather mediocre veiw of Odinism.,"Definity not a book for beginners.Their was a complete lack of explanation of the gods, blots, sumbels, ve's, horgs, and other essential stuff that is necessary for the religion.I will admit though that the mead making instructions and the horn crafting instructions were good.His expanation of Seidr magic was terrible and he failed to give an overveiw on the proper ritual tools.When the author put out books on Wicca he furthur proved his lack of genuinity in the Nordic Path.Sorry Mr. Fitch, Odinists want to buy books made by Odinists, not some wiccan trying to make a few extra bucks.To all Asatru/Odinists:If you want books on Odinism I suggest The Book of Troth written by Edred Thorrson and Asatru Rituals series written by Steven McNallen.(you can find this in the World Tree Publications, just go to the search engine, type World Tree Publications and you can find it from their.)The one thing I hate most is watching fellow kinsmen getting the wrong Info."
5,delightful,The work contained in ths tome is wonderful. Through devotion to deity can one come face to face with the Gods and fully know the truth.
1,A Travesty!,If you want to know about the ancient paths...DO NOT GET THIS BOOK! It should be taken out of print! BAD! BAD! BAD! Thank the Gods I reviewed a borrowed copy! This and Blumbo's book should be burned...
1,Fluff-N-Stuff,"What can be said for this book? As far as information pertaining to our faith, this book is utter rubbish. and rather insulting. it has very little useful information in it.However, the pictures inside the book are rather pretty. So that's....something...Most of my experience in Asatru is solitary, as it is not a very popular faith to be in. i purchased this book in a cute little witch shop in california, and the woman behind the counter jokingly said ""Ahh The rites of Odinn Yarrrrrrrr""at the time i was a little offended, but now that i realize how little useful information this book has provided, i realize her comment was spot on.On a positive side, I did give this book to my brother, who is a warrior style wiccan. he found many of the passages to be interesting and helpful. so it is good that some people can find meat in this book. other than the pictures, i didn't find anything worth the money i spent.Yarrr."
2,don't bother,"The biggest problem with this book is that it isn't a good book on wicca and it isn't a good book on Odinism, leaving it in a no-man's-land inbetween the two. People interested in wicca are better off with something by Buckland or Cunningham or any of the other decent wiccan authors, and people looking for heathen books are better off with anything else but this. The back of the book is extremely deceptive, although the author is slightly more honest in his introduction. The mythology and lore found in the book are useless as is the rune information. The few useful bits on mead and drinking horns just aren't enough to make the book worth the money. This is one man's practices and opinions and provides an interesting look at what Ed Fitch believes, but will be useless for beginning asatruar and wiccans and pointless to those with more expereince."
3,Not as good as some of the others in the Bailey series.,I use the Bailey School Kids Series in myspecial education classroom. This book didnot receive as much enthusiasm as several ofthe others in the series according to theones who count....the kids reading thesebooks.
3,What's with the title?,"I didn't like this movie because the title provides only a cursory idea of what the movie is about and the film is idiosycratic in ways that are unforgivable. First, the film is mostly about one guy who used to be a womanizer and is trying to change his ways with a girl that is his ideal of the savior. When that doesn't work out he becomes a mess that he doesn't completely recover from. The film is about the characters overcoming their idylic obsessions and settling for what's really there. There's a sense of settling at the end, however it's the main character who settles himself down and not his relationship with the girl, or his mother. I was also surprised that women didn't have main roles in this film considering the title, but the film isn't really interested in them. They only exist to show the main character's flaws. A very unsatisfactory film is the result."
1,Completely overrated,"Don't get me wrong; I love small independent films, and I love slow-moving films. This film, however, is unspeakably dull and its characters moronic. I lost interest well before the end, and I'm sorry I wasted my time on it. Apparently some people really love this film, but I would suggest keeping your expectations low if you decide to watch it."
5,Hilarious!,"This movie is one of the funniest documentaries I've ever seen. I saw this at the Bside release in Austin and laughed from beginning to end. The SAP developed these pretty normal, yet hilarious characters and watched them go through the most grueling and comical of competitions. From drinking while running through a creek to carrying your partner on your back, the amount of alcohol consumed is absolutely stunning. The final event is, by far, the most impressive. I won't spoil it, but to watch these guys drink so much so quickly is an amazing feat that few could pull off, but everyone should try.Anyone who went through the typical college experience will absolutely love this film. It reminds us of all our youth and how we should grow up but never old. Great film! Highly recommended!"
1,Poor,"I had high hopes, after a few buddies told me about it, and saw it during a screening ... but it turned out to be unfunny, low production value, and just boring, unfortunately. It had its moments, but I hate to say I was happy to see the credits roll ...."
2,One out of Four failed,"I thought those a good idea and bought Four of the little units. Now, less than a month later One has failed. I hope it's just a fluke and the others hold up. As far as working? I can't tell any change."
3,still hoping-- but may not be up for the job,"I have 3 cats, and 3 litter boxes in my laundry room. The odor can be pretty intense even when scooping daily. I found a small battery powered air cleaner that seemed to help, but was going thru batteries, so tried this plug in air purifier. It says in the directions to place it as high as possible, which we did do, and it seems to be helping with the smell somewhat, but I must say this is not doing as whell as I had hoped for the price. It does say that performance should improve with time, so I am giving it more time. My laundry room is about 8 x 16, so maybe a little larger than what this item can handle. Also, I may try moving to the level of the boxes to see if that helps. But, at this point, I wouldn't say I am satisfied or could recommend this as a room air sanitizer."
3,Pale imitation,"Valmont came out after the superior Dangerous Liasons and it suffers badly by comparison. Colin Firth is cute but he comes off like a drunken frat boy instead of the cold hearted monster that John Malkovich played. When Malkovich's Valmont dies you know why and it's actually a tragedy. With Firth's Valmont dies it seems pointless.Annette Benning is okay at the Countess but while watching her I kept thinking of Glenn Close. Her version of the Countess would've eaten Annette alive. Meg Tilly is terrible. The actors playing young Cecile and Daunceny are well cast, I must say. This wasn't a bad film, it's just weak in several areas."
2,The High School Actors' Version of Dangerous Liaisons,"The previous reviewer who noted the overacting of Bening and Firth needs to be commended. Colin Firth is too likable and sympathetic in nature to be cast as Valmont, and this movie will show you that Miss Bening's talents reside in her looks. With the exception of Fairuza Balk, the casting and acting in this version of Dangerous Liaisons smacks of High School Drama Class. Swoosie Kurtz in a period costume drama? I enjoy Swoosie Kurtz, but who put her in this? A great storyline, beautiful sets, and good costumes will fool some people into thinking this is worth two hours of their time. If you want to enjoy the storyline in an alternate version of Dangerous Liaisons, treat yourself to the Korean version of the same tale, entitled ""Untold Scandal""."
1,use your trash can,"I'm a Jane Austin fan so when I read the reveiw that rated this film so highly, I thought I would enjoy it. While I enjoyed the costumes I find the story is trash and, instead of giving the dvd it away, threw it away. It's not ""R"" rated but it should be T for trash. The seduction of the 15 year old is very poorly done - putting it mildly."
4,Just a'iiight...,"I bought this for my son, and he loves it. For an adult, it's a'iiiight, but for him, he's five, its AWESOME!!!!!"
1,This game sucks a lot.,Normally I love Sonic The Hedgehog but this was the worst game Ive ever played in my life.Do not buy this game.
3,Bought for cereal formula,"I bought these for my 4 month old, who needs cereal in her formula. She was having issues getting her meal with a level 2, so I discovered these and thought our problems were solved. Unfortunatley, these nipples flow too fast for her and she was gulping/choking trying to keep up. I bought 4 packages of these, boiled them all and now can't use them. I am hoping the older she gets, we will be able to use them and get our money's worth!"
3,Faster than expected,"My son is almost 6 months and his last bottle of the night I put a good deal of cereal in, which is too thick for most nipples so I bought these to go with his Dr. Brown's bottles. They are too fast for him, even thick w/ cereal! He does much better with an Avent bottle w/ a Stage 4 nipple and isn't overwhelmed. I'm sure these are fine, but at the same time a kid that is old enough to handle this fast of a flow, probably doesn't really need bottles with cereal anymore."
1,Worthless Waste of Money,"There's nothing holding the legs of this stand together. To look at the pictures, one might think that the leg extensions snap in place firmly like Lego blcoks, but that's not the case. One piece simply rests on another without the beneift of friction, so it falls apart easily when jostled. If this happens while your monitor is resting on the stand, your first instinct might be to tilt the stand so you can reconnect the leg, at which point another leg will likely fall off. Honestly, the whole thing should come with a tube of crazy glue, because it's a complete failure of a product as-is."
2,wrong color and wrong height,"First, though it appears to be black with dark grey legs -- both in the Amazon picture and on the box it arrives in -- it's actually a medium grey platform with light grey legs. So if you need it to be a particular color to blend with your desk and monitors, just be aware that there is a bit of false advertising going on here.Second, the adjustable leg pieces are just too big -- about 1.5 inches each -- so it's very difficult to get exactly the right height. It would be better if they were smaller (say .75 inches), so that you could get the platform to sit at the height you really need.All that said, I haven't seen any better options on Amazon, so I might just stick with it."
2,item returned - will not accomodate a laptop under the stand,"the reason I bought this is so that I can put a laptop under the stand. it is too narrow to accomodate a laptop. the width between the risers is 7.5"" also the risers kept falling off whenever I'd lift the stand. returned item"
4,Greatest football game ever!!!!,"Now I realize that i have not even played this game. But if I could pick one game other than Halo 2 to come out, this is it. I am almost definetly buying this game, it lokks awesome. You know its god because it came from the creaters of Madden. I cant wait til it comes out in january."
2,Street genre doesn't translate to Football,"You might be tempted to buy this game if you like NBA Street. Unfortunately, you will be disapointed. The street feel simply doesn't carry over into a football simulation. The game play is really simple, and the graphics are pretty decent but this game is an just an average football simulation. The gamebreaker is stupid, and all the players talk the exact same trash. This is a one day rental."
5,CORRECT WAY TO USE ITEM,"Believe it or not there is a correct way to use this item. Yes, it's true, it does leave bubbles, however, if you read the literature about how to prepare formula bottles correctly you will see that you should prepare the bottle and put in the fridge for an hour to settle. I breatfeed/formula feed my 4 1/2 month old son & have never had any problems because I prepare his bottles this way. I feel that shaking is more messy and in the long run who needs another mess....aren't we busy enough. :-)"
1,Why the need?,I'm confused. Why would one even need this product? What's wrong with just shaking the formula in the bottle? That has always worked for us.
5,Wish I had found this with my first child,"This is fantastic! I prefer to mix formula one bottle at a time and this was the only thing that I could use to do that short of shaking the bottle (and thus adding bubbles that upset my baby's tummy). It's inexpensive but it lasted the entire time I was making bottles of formula - for about a year. I really wish I had had one of these with my first baby. Worth more to me than what I paid, for sure!"
2,Bad...,"I bought this item twice.. The first one I bought played out within a week.. I couldn't find where I put the other one.. I found it 4 days ago and started using it, last night it gave out as well.. The idea of the product is great. It has great power for the first week and that is it. I wish i could get a refund for it or atlease one,or hell just send me another one, but it's ok.. Hope they will improve their product. I seen that munchkin has one, but the prince Lion had better reviews, but maybe I'll try the munchkin brand... Yes yes.. I also made sure that it did not get wet beyond the little stick and it still played out. I will not buy another one. I believe that two is the limit."
4,I recommend buying this,"I bought it from Amazon and found it real handy, no more lumps, easy to use and clean. Only thing I wish was that it had some control on reducing the rotation speed, but regardless it does the job well! I say, buy it and try it."
3,No frills Joystick,"I was looking for something to get with a free Amazon gift certificate I had, so I bought this joystick. It was easy enough to install, and conformed well enough to my hand. After about a year of off and on use, it developed a sticking, which caused my character to constantly be moving to the left. This made games unplayable, and the joystick now decorates a shelf. Not a terrific joystick, but not bad for what I paid for it: nothing."
4,Alaskan Adventure,"This is a great story about how life is lived in the villages of Alaska. It has suspense, and holds your interest. I can't wait to read the next book. Great series"
4,Jawbreaker,Blake Schwarzenbach is the genious behind Jets to Brazil and Jawbreaker. Kiss the Bottle is one of the more famous Jawbreaker songs. Dave Grohl is the man for covering this one.It's also been covered by Sparta who did an awesome job as well.
1,MicroNet 3 button mouse # PD971,"The left and right buttons function as any other mouse would normally do @ any price range, however.......the middle scroll button refuses to respond at all! Software for this item has been loaded and unloaded several times and it still fails to do what the product info claims it will do! Would not reccomend this product at all!"
1,not a fan of her fake smile and style,"the yoga itself can be a challenge, but i am picky on this dvd. her voice isn't soothing at all and she always has on this goofy fake smile. very annoying. we aren't doing yoga to look cute and smile. that is what she represents. i couldn't even make it through a workout. not recommended at all."
4,Shiva Rea,Great product. I really like the matrix option to create a workout. Would not reccomend for people new to yoga or just learning.
5,Different from what I'm used to,"She is a very good instructor... Different style,(I'm used to astangha)but I loved the freedom of it... I you want to try something different../ Try it..."
3,"how to convert your car, van, or pickup to a diesel","the book is technicaly in formative,but not worth the priceas a used conditioned paperback,it should be sold at a lower market value. As a marketed value its outdated a rip off!!!!!!!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"When I first found out I was pregnant everyone told me to use Dr. Browns. They all said they are the best bottles and that nothing compared. My son has execlusively used them for two months now and I think the hype is not all its cracked up to be. Simply stated they leak. I will go to feed him an half an ounce will pour out all over his clothes. Also, everytime I go out I have to put the bottles in a ziploc bag just to prevent them from leaking all over the diaper bag. I am very frustrated with them and I am switching to Playtex Ventaire they work just as well and they don't leak."
2,Good but messy,"I registered for these bottles while I was pregnant based on reviews I had read and hear-say from people I'd meet in the store while ""researching"" them. Of course when you are a first time mom you aren't familiar with any of the baby stuff so you have to take advice on these sorts of things from other moms. I think the concept of these bottles is wonderful but they are too aggravating. I never used one of these bottles that didn't leak. No matter what I did to try to get them not to leak, it didn't work. So they made for a very messy feeding time and a waste of milk; and as a first time mom with a newborn, this is the last thing I wanted to deal with! I always had to make sure that my daughter had a bib on or I had a burp cloth tucked under her chin. I have recently switched to the Playtex VentAire and feeding time is much more enjoyable and not messy at all!"
2,"Great idea, bad nipples.","I think the engineering of this bottle system is great, but the nipples are just too small and narrow. My baby would put the whole thing in her mouth and her lips would touch the plastic rim. I never purchased any more after my initial set. I much preferred the Avent bottles and found they were much closer to breast feeding anatomy."
4,Great Bottles,"I have a newborn who was 5 weeks premature and had trouble feeding after being tube fed for a couple weeks. These bottles were great and she definately had no trouble with gas which my firstborn drove me crazy with. The only thing I didn't like was that you have to have the insert inside or the nipple and ring leak, this makes shaking up a formula bottle hard because the dry powder can get stuck in the tube and not mix well."
4,Worth a try!,"I spent hours running around town frantically trying to find these bottles after reading positive reviews. My baby had acid reflux and was always screaming after feedings. I switched him to these bottles instead of advent. To be honest, I didn't really see that much difference. The only real thing to do when you have a baby that never stops crying is know that it will end one day and you'll barely remember how bad it was. I guess these bottles are worth a try if you're at the end of your rope, like I was, but they're no miracle cure. If you're on a tight budget just wait it out!! The crying will stop!!!"
2,too bad they leak,"I bought Dr. Brown's bottles when my premature daughter's digestive system started acting up. I've been using them for about six weeks now and I haven't really noticed a change in the amount of gas she has. She seems to be comfortable with the size and shape of the nipple -- although I had bought her the preemie-sized nipples, and they were so hard for her to suck that I had to go all the way to a stage 2 nipple. Why make a preemie nipple with such a small hole when preemies have a weaker suck? My biggest problem with the Dr. Brown's bottles is leakage. They leak horribly if you have to transport them, like in a diaper or insulated bag. Just recently they have started leaking during feedings -- even after I had taken apart the bottle to double-check that all the parts were put together properly. I have just bought the Playtex VentAir bottles today -- hopefully they work out better for us."
3,These are okay...,"I bought these bottles based on the other reviews for one of my twins. She spit up a lot after feedings with the Avent bottles (my other daughter had no problem with the Avent bottles) and since they were going to be on 2 different formulas, it seemed a good idea to get a brand new bottle type. Although I believe she spit up much less with the Dr. Brown system, she ate so slowly that she would only finish half of her bottle and then would fall asleep (she had been drinking 5 oz. and could only finish between 2-3 oz. with the Dr. Brown system). She would then wake up hungry in 2 hours when she previously was eating every 3 1/2-4 hours! I have since stopped using the system and now just use different nipples on the tops of these bottles. It was sort of a waste of money for me but it might be that my daughter is a fussy eater. She did spit up less so that was a good thing but not worth the small and slow feedings. I'm hoping I will be able to use the system for her later on."
1,Didn't work for us = (,"I bought these thinking they would help my 2 week old with his gas and spit up problems, but the nipples are small compared to some other brands (Avent, Playtex) and he was able to drink WAY TOO FAST with even the stage 1 nipple of this bottle system. He ended up spitting up even more than before. We're sticking with Avent, which isn't perfect, but seems to be the brand he spits up the least with."
2,Are you kidding...,"what a pain, too many parts to wash and keep track of. We tried practically every bottle available and the old fashioned plastic bottle with the plain nipples worked as well as any. We couldn't tell any difference in the amount of gas on baby's tummy."
1,Not good at all,"I do not recommend this bottle. First of all, the extra parts make it very unhygenic when making milk, especially when you are outside. It doesn't reduce gas as it claims to be. Even though it came with a small brush, there are still areas you cannot reach to clean. And worst of all, even with the stopper, this bottle leak if it is not upright."
3,First time use,"I just bought these bottles today and used it one time. I already notice that it makes my baby dribble out of his mouth. I used the playtex before and just got tired of squeezing the bag to get air out so I thought I'd try these. I plan to try a few times and see if it's worth it, but I don't like having to take the bottle out of his mouth several times to clean his chin. I didn't have this problem with playtex. I'm not sure there is a certain thing as a perfect bottle. (...)"
5,This bottle is a must have!,"Due to a low milk supply, I have had to supplement with formula. It's not been something that has thrilled me, with all the gas and spitting up and a baby who has cried almost constantly since the day we brought him home. My fiance saw an ad for these bottles in a magazine and picked one up one day just to try it out. Well, we tried it and it has been awesome! Hardly any burping at all, much less crying, and he hasn't spit up once!!! Everyone needs at least one of these bottles, even if you are breastfeeding!!! They are Great!"
4,A Great Bottle!,"These bottles are great! They do help minimize colic. My baby spit up everything until we got these bottles. The only thing I do not like is that they leak! Use the inserts to be sure they don't spill out in your diaper bag! Also, if you are warming them up, loosen the top or the formula will leak out and it is very messy! I cannot find the level 3 nipples anywhere!Otherwise, they are great!"
4,Love It!,"I bought this for my niece who has loved the Monkees since she was 3 years old. On occasion, I've had the chance to get her other Monkees items but she's been watching those videos for 6 years and never seems to get tired of them.The Monkees not only gave us fun, catchy tunes but they appeared on a funny tv show that was too short-lived.If you're a Monkees fan, I recommend these videos."
5,DNS Resource and Guide,"I have gone thru almost all the book so far and I find that is full of tips to make my speech recognition use a better experience. Yes, it is true that in some instances I would like to see more macros, but that would require a devoted book on the subject. I am a software trainer and I always find that different audiences have different expectatives and sometimes they find I have not met them. Good work and I congratulate the authors for the effort on putting so much information at hand."
4,Dragon Naturallyspeaking Complete,I would like to contact Michael H. Zajdel who wrote a review on this book.Please contact me at LELawson@aol.com
2,Try the Hamilton Beach Instead!,"I have purchased two Cuisinart Food Processors and both failed within a short period of time. After the first one failed, it was just off warranty and since I DID like the way it could be used to process food, I purchased a second unit, which again failed within a very short time. This time I sent it back to the company with a request for repair or exchange. When it was returned, it worked twice. I gave up, dumped it, and purchased a Hamilton Beach unit with which I have been quite pleased so far."
4,New to food processors,"This is my first procesor,Which I bought after much thought. I have had it a week and am very pleased with the machine. I bought this one because it came with a video,its a good video, and reduced my learning curve. For under $100 I have all the blades I need too. I have ways to go before I use this machine instinctively, but i have been practicing on dog bisquits,and have a lot of happy dogs. This was a good buy."
3,Not as durable as I hoped,"I have used this processor for 3 years with moderate use. Unfortunately, the small plastic parts on the bowl and top that have to engage broke after two years. Now I have to manually hold the top down for it to work. Replacement pars are too expensive to be a good investment. Enjoyed it immensely other than that. The engineers really should have made parts out of something than plastic."
5,WOW The Best thing since sliced bread,"My husband thinks I am crazy! I was amazed at what this does and how well it does it. Grate a 1lb block of cheese in 5 seconds (perfectly), chop onions, celery, bell peppers and anything else evenly...I swear it has a brain of its own. This is the first time I actually have made space on my counter top for a food processor. Well worth every penny."
1,One word - Lousy :(,"The product broke while almost new. The product slightly slipped from my lap while I was sitting on the floor. As soon as that happend, I could hear the parts moving!! Called customer service... their response reflected the product quality too - lousy."
5,Cuisinart Food Processer,"I purchased the food processor to assist me in putting up garden produce. As I has arthritis in my hands, this has been a wonderful addition to my kitchen. It works absolutely great and saves me a great deal of time. I love the rinse and dry part. I now use it quite frequently for more chores and cannot wait to try making bread using the Cuisinart."
1,Defective plastic parts,"I bought a new DLC 10S food processor to replace one I had used for several years, but which had broken off several of the plastic pieces on the work bowl assembly. The new plastic parts seemed difficult to work at first, but I thought they would get smoother with time. Instead the obviously slightly miscast plastic parts became more and more difficult, until yesterday I injured my hand and wrist trying to get the top off so I could remove some processed food.The motor is great, but the plastic parts have made using this food processor impossible at present."
5,tip top,"And Tough little work horse. Just the right size for a family of four.Easy to use and clean.I'm on my third because my old one was swiped.My second is still being used.My third was given to a young family joining another young family. They love theirs, too."
4,Like a charm!,Not a lot of accessories/blades but this product does quite well with the blades provided
4,Finally replaced my old one,This works as well or better than the one I purchased about 20 years ago. Gave the old one to my kids and am happy using this. It's powerful and quiet. Did not need a bigger FP since it's now just the two of us. The $99 price convinced me.
2,Designed by lawyers,"This food processor is annoying to use and impossible to clean because of all the safety mechanisms. I almost never use it. If you're not a complete idiot and can resist the temptation to stick your fingers into a spinning metal blade, look elsewhere. Unfortunately, I can see how this device would be of great use if it didn't take longer to clean than it would in almost any circumstance to just chop by hand with a knife. At least, until lawyers start designing knives."
4,Good piece of equipment,I purchased this processor for my wife and I got to use it first. Putting the different pieces together was not difficult. The actual food processing was a breeze. But after that it was a struggle to clean up the parts. Food particles get trapped in crevices that nothing can reach except high water flow. Also chopping green veggies like cilantro is not a strong suit of this Cuisinart.
4,Powerful.,"I'm very happy with my food processor. It is fairly quiet, smooth running and powerful. Whatever I put in there is no challenge at all for this processor. It can sometimes be a bit difficult to put the top on, but maybe that's only because I am still fairly new with it. A great machine."
2,the new model is not as good: issues with wide feed,"The blades are sharp, and it has a powerful motor, but the new ""lid system"" is totally unacceptable.To use the wide feeder (which is a bit wider than the standard feed on the older models), you have to cut the item up into 3 inch lengths. It is not possible to feed 10 inch carrots, a long block of cheese, etc., into the wide feeder without the ""pusher"" being on top of the product and locked into place.The new lid system to be used with the grater/slicer has many interlocking components, and seems more bulky than useful. It also seems likely they will break over time.If you are not likely to use the grater/slicer often, this is a perfectly good product (and you can take advantage of the feeder-less lid).I'll be getting the Braun food processor instead."
5,cuisnart food processor,"I AM A 64 YR. OLD MAN. I'M AM EXCELLENT COOK & HAVE BEEN COOKING SINCE I WAS 6 YRS OLD. MY FATHER TAUGHT ME. HE WAS A CHEF. I JUST PURCHASED A 14 CUP CUISNART FOOD PROCESSOR. I HAVE ALL GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT IT. VERY EASY TO USE, CLEAN, & DOES SO MANY THINGS I USED TO DO BY HAND. IT'S FASTER, FUN TO USE, VERY STRONG & HEFTY, YET COMPACT. IT IS EASY TO STORE OR LEAVE IT ON THE COUNTR TOP & SHOW OFF. I AM VERY HARD TO PLEASE OR CHANGE FROM THE OLD WAYS. THIS CUISNART FOOD PROSSOR IS NOT JUST A KITCHEN APPLIANCE IT'S A TOY. (MY TOY)"
1,BLADE IS FALLING APART! TINY PIECE IN FOOD!!!,I HAVE OWNED THIS FOOD PROCESOR AOBUT 1 YEAR. I USE IT ON AN AVERAGE OF ONCE A WEEK. CHOP MEAT AND VEGIES. THE BLADE IS FALLING APART. A TINY PIECE BROKE OFF AND NOW I HAVE TO THROW OUT AN ENTIRE MEAl! VERY DANGEROUS! I AM SWITCHING TO KITCHEN AID.
4,Great... but,"A great and indispensible asset to any serious kitchen, but... really could be better engineered. Awkward to assemble each time, and an awful lot to clean up... but couldn't do without it!"
5,Excellent,"This pizza stone really works, yo. My pizza crusts are all nice & crispy now. I've even baked the take and bake bread from the Kroger's on the stone & it makes the bread much more appetizing (we have no good bakeries where I live). Furthermore, the company itself is awesome. They sent the rectangular pizza stone by mistake and, immediately after I contacted them, they sent the right round pizza stone (and told me to keep the other stone). They were extremely courteous and efficient. Excellent product and excellent customer service."
3,Not bad for the money,"While this controller is not as responsive as the newer USB models, it has the advantage of being really inexpensive. This controller is set up just like the Sony Playstation controller and hooks up through your gameport. If you don't want to spend the money this one is for you."
2,NOT the stage version and NOT pure Cole Porter,"While the story may be entertaining in its own right, and ANY chance to see Donald O'Conner dance is worth it, this can be a very disappointing film to Porter buffs. The plot has nothing to do with the stage play except that some of it does take place on a ship. The story line is totally different and therefore some of Porter's original songs have been taken out and replaced by songs of Sammy Cahn and James Van Huesen which do not live up to Porter's quality.The best examples I can give is the fact that there is no Evangelist so the title song ""Anything Goes"" turns into a second act number, sung by Mitzi and chorus (with horrific word changes) and ""Blow Gabriel Blow"" becomes a finale in the broadway show (sung by the four main characters) that comes at the end of the picture and has nothing to do with any character or plot line.If you haven't seen it on stage it's pleasant enough, but if you're expecting the broadway show it's a major disappointment."
3,ENTERTAINING,Love the dance scenes with Mitzi Gaynor and Donald O'Connor. Don't think Bing Crosby suited the part & some of the acting was very forced. Remember this film from years ago simply for the dance sequences.
1,Anything Goes,"The music was pleasing, we enjoyed Donald O'Connor and his acting with the ladies in the film. The dark haired lady in the film did not fit the film. Bing Crosby looked bored throughout the movie."
3,shrinkage,"book that was designed for an audience that uses microscopes as reading glasses. the original format was larger than tabloid, but there was a computer crash when printing and the whole book shrunk to little, tiny, beautiful, delicate pieces of typography... that no one can read! suggestion: selling a combo that will feature soakwashrinsespin and a stop at the doctor for quick eye-enhancing laser operation. i think 6pt type is beautiful but this pushes it a bit, not necessarily in a good direction."
2,Squint Wash Rinse Squint,"Hmm. There's just something about this book that's off... possibly the fact that it's TYPED IN A 7 POINT FONT. Pictures are great and all, but when you have to jam the book up to your nose to make out the explanations, it stops being ""cool."" 30 bucks for a book you can't read, be warned."
3,An Ensamble of masters jamming on Jobin,"As a fan of smooth brazilian jazz, I was stunned when this album was available years ago on the Ensamble of masters behind it.. good relaxing music and atmosphere in it, yet there is something missing.. perhaps I expected more sophistication.. it is pleasent music to pass your caipirinhea.."
2,Good phone with a big problem for the walkman,While listening to Radio often I hear high pitched beeps. And after some time this digital noise becames anoying. Considering this is designed to be a walkman phone I find this to be a major problem.
1,Stolen identity,"This product was purchased with my credit card from my amazon account where I thought my info was safe.. I, however, did not make this purchase. Because of this laspse in security, my identity was stolen through amazon and this phone was what they purchased. Beware of having your personal info on Amazon.com, take any of your financial info off, trust me!"
1,Garbage movie,This movie is straight basura. Garbage. If you want to laugh at a low budget crappy latino gangster movie then this movie is for you. I laughed at the MOVIE becuz it was sooo bad that it made me laugh. The fight scene between the brothers was comical they fought each other like Popeye. You should watch this movie with beers and friend and laugh at how bad it is........the artistic brother gets show with a Rifle at the end...yet he survives??? haha what bull.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I AM A BIG FAN OF "" AMERICAN ME "" "" BLOOD IN BLOOD OUT "" ETC. BUT THIS ONE JUST TOTALLY SUCKED!!! IT HAS REALLY CHEESY SOUND EFFECTS AND THE STORY IS WELL NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT. I THINK YOU SHOULD WATCH "" SCARFACE "" "" GOODFELLAS"" "" GOD FATHER "" TRAFFIC "" CARLITOS WAY "" BLOW "" 21 GRAMS "" TRAINING DAY "" JUST TO SAME A FEW."
3,Ice thing does not seem to stay cold,"I like the container, it's a good size, sturdy, but the ice thing does not stay cold. Perhaps I have a defective one as I did not see this mentioned in the other reviews, but I have also had no problems with fitting the ice into the container, or the lid. I guess they don't have very good quality standards.Nice product - but get yourself another cold method as a back up."
2,Quality issues,I work 12 hours days and I was happy to see a lunch box big enough store enough food for a long day. I started using this in April 2011 and after just a few months I noticed cracking in the lining and now there are so many cracks I am forced to replace the bag since the lining is not replaceable.
2,Arrived with interior rips - twice.,"This may be a great lunch box - I'll never know. The first one that I ordered arrived with rips to the interior liner in the lower compartment - so I returned it for a new one. The second one that I ordered also arrived with rips to the interior liner, this time in the upper compartment. I don't think lightning strikes twice. I'm a little skeptical of the sturdiness of this product given that two arrived broken."
4,"Very good lunchbox, but could be better","Purchased two of these for my kids for school (they love the skull/bones, mom hates it). They have good zippers and solid construction, but I can see the lining will tear out after a while. My main complaint though is that there is nothing to keep the shape of the bottom compartment so the whole thing is usually a mis-shapen pile which leads to squished fruit/sandwiches.A similar sized/shaped lunchbox but superior in most ways is my box from Duluth Trading Company ([...]). It corrects all these problems plus adds a convenient pocket for an ice packet. The Dead On is a super value and very rugged but doing over, I would spent the $35 for the DTC one.UPDATE: After one school season the lining is indeed torn to shreds and gets bound up in the zipper. Exterior still holding up very well but the interior is, as my kids would say: epic fail. Would not buy again."
2,it's ok,"Kool looking lunch bag, that's why i bought it. Plastic on the inside is starting to brake apart. Otherwise it is an ok lunch bag for its price."
5,Very Satisfied,I bought this for my son for Christmas.He takes a large lunch to work.This bag has 2 good sized compartments.It holds a lot.It is good quality.I would buy again for someone else.
5,Fantastic,I purchased this for my husband who loves to take a 'million' various sized lunch/snack boxes everyday to work. He LOVES it. It is not only spacious but it looks very stylish if you wear it like a crossbody bag. It is extremely spacious but does not look huge from outside.
5,Innovative styles combine to blow your perception of reality,"Reality after owning this CD will change for the better. Happiness is the most significant emotion this music creates and you will not be disappointed with this CD. Every song on the album is a bit different and makes for the entire CD an excellent listen. It kind of takes you on a journey too.. smoothly taking off, rocketing into never-never land and then gently landing you back on Mother Earth. Best money I ever spent on a CD!!"
1,Deserves to be in a mouse trap...,"I got one of these, it worked great at first, then died in about a month. Chalked it up to bad luck, got another one, same thing, died in a month. I've tried cleaning it, there's never anything in there, something internal must just give out. Very frustrating. Sometimes, you get what you pay for."
4,"Great Album, pick it up!","OK, I know that this is definitely an yngwie album incapable of being original, but aside from that, Yngwie manages to bring some of the songs alive more than the actual artists could. A great, worthwhile listen by all means"
3,Bonus-CD is a big Mistake !,"To be short and clear: the 1(head)cd contains good music, simply with Malmsteens label; flying speed. the 2cd don't gives you what you're payed for; 5 (verry good) collector-bonustracks fades away and broke-of after about 1 minute, for the ""great"" Yngwie-intervieuw. ""Spitfire records"" is not taking his music/Malmsteen/buyers seriously: it's a BIG shame !!!(for that label)"
4,Sexuality is Damn Scary!,"This is a step up from Shatter-Dead, but if you're expecting high production values, classy acting, and expensive CGI, go away.If you enjoy nudity (quite a bit, and weird nudity, things that make you double-check your own body), a good action sequence at the end, and transgressive atmosphere, this is your movie.Imagine all hell breaking loose at a hotel that hosts porno, whores, and crazy sex acts, and it all taking place in the future on a low budget. It's awesome, but more subtle in its scares rather than in your face.A good second movie...worth the long seven-year wait."
4,The life and times of an American castle.,"This book gives an intimate look at one of ""America's Castles"" from inside and out. The history of the building site is covered, as is the design and construction of the buildings. The life and times of W.R. Hearst and his friends and loved ones are presented in such a way as to flesh out the character of the house.I just finished reading this book, and I'm tempted to pick it up and start all over again. This is one that I'll reread often.The layout of the book is interesting and eye-catching, but the tints used on the pages sometimes make the text difficult to read. Make sure you sit down with this book in a very well-lit room -- not only will light make it that much easier to read, you'll be able to enjoy the wonderful pictures more easily."
5,The best indie ever,"This cd is the bomb, I love it god, Momatchingdrapes are the coolest. But people don't know about them. They need to be more recognized...Geeze the cd is a little distorted though, they deserve more than an indie title also...in my mind there better than modest mouse they haven't sold out."
2,Arrived broken,The plastic latch on the holding bowl was cracked. It does work. I hope it lasts as it is a pain to send it back and wait for yet another box of cheap plastic.
4,"Does a great job, saves time.","I've had this for about 10 years. So I know that it will last a long time. I used it to slice frozen meat even, and that worked well. used the S blade with nuts, and made ground meats also. so as far as functional and long lasting I give it 5 stars. If you're using the other blades not the S blade, it is a little loud. sometimes the lock-in system is not as easy as when it was new. All the parts are still in good condition, nothings broken or rusty. I give it 4 stars because to unlock it, you need to use a little force, other than that its a 5 star. Heavy, strong durable machine."
2,Sad end to a noble name,"Cuisinart is practically synonymous with food processor. When the French were manufacturing them years ago, you couldn't touch another blender, processor or kitchen appliance that would do more. But the manufacturer changed, and so did the Cuisinart.My cuisinart bowl cracked at the base. To their credit, they did replace the bowls. Now the knives, the most critical part of the food processor, are no longer the same.In addition, if you do heavy breads (we like to do rye) you will find that the stem can overheat and the bowl can stick on it for a bit (until you figure out how to get it off, not easy, let me tell you.) I once even had the plastic dough blade stick onto the stem.The bowl isn't so easy to clean, either. I give it three stars because it still slices and dices with the greatest skill, but overall, I would not buy one again. Sad...."
1,Not So Hot,"This product arrived in great shape, but when I put it together it would not work. I viewed the included video several times and read the instructions repeatedly but was not able to make the product perform. The lid would not attach to the base completely, so the unit would not turn on. This is an expensive product, and it does not perform as claimed. Save your money."
1,Not worth the money,This movie is somebodies idea of what it would be like to be a person with this type of horrible past. It has no bearing on reality. Do not waste your money unless you have money to waste.
1,Pointless,"I found this movie pointless, devoid of story, dull and sick. I couldn't feel for the poor sick, child molesting man. I couldn't like the woman for caring about him. And when the molester wanted the little girl to sit on his lap, I wanted to jump into the film. Please avoid this film. There is much better in the sea of movieland than this stinker.The movie attempts to build sympathy for a child molester. One scene the molester is trying to entice a child, and the next the molester beats up another molester.Regarding Kevin bacon's acting performance - the entire movie he remains quiet, looking depressed. That's it. Very few lines.This film left me sick to my stomach and bored to tears."
2,A MOVIE YOU WILL NOT WANT TO SEE TWICE!,"Kevin Bacon did a good acting job, hopefully not fromexperience! If this movie is supposed to make me feelsorry for pedophiles, IT DIDN'T WORK! The first hour ofthis nauseating movie, was boring beyond words! The restwill just make your blood boil! UNRECOMMENDED!"
4,We're No Angels,"An excellent comedy, especially appealing with Bogart in such a role. This movie is well worth watching, but falls just a bit short of greatness."
5,5 star movie!,"Great script - don't make em like that anymore! A young Peter Ustinoz, oh yeah, and the other guy, too. Bogey was great as always! Cute story i've never seen before but i'm sure was popular when it came out in 1955! Enjoy watching these guys work together - as one reviewer said, a Christmas favorite!"
5,One of my favorite Christmas Movies! Never goes out of style!,"I love this movie. It's hokey and stagey but still a wonderfully done movie. I own it on VHS and watch it every December. I love the theme song, Sentimental Journey. All of the actors are great, and I love the choreography (for example, with the suitcases - see the film to see what I'm talking about). Even if it is silly in an old-fashioned way, it never goes out of style: this year's viewing reminded me of the 99% and 1% that is so in the news this year. Peter Ustinov is superb in voice and body language. The story is simple, but the script is clever in a way rarely seen today, where so many movies are thrown together with no regard for good writing. Even ""I think he looks like a glass of milk"" stays with me. Get your family together for a nice evening with this film."
1,Goes to show you there is a market for anything,"This dude couldn't cut it in the real rap game so itlooks like he had to do rap that that only hicks couldenjoy. I guess the beats in show biz beats the pay atFootlocker. Country and mainstream hip hop are the twomost annoying genres in exsistance. And this CD goeson the annoying list aswell. I don;t know what isworse.... the music or the term ""Hick-Hop"" as it isn'teven catchy.Sorry, this uncle tom wannabe isn't fooling me."
2,Camp out on the Late Night Lawn of 80s Memorabilia,"Elmer Bernstein is probobly best known for his work on the 80s smash ""Ghostbusters,"" especially for his clever transition themes and quasi-romantic and sometimes humerous segues. Anyone familiar with the visual material of ""Spies Like Us"" will experience the well known ""audio paint brush"" effect of coupling music and image. What is lacking, however are the two strongest musical moments in the film, namely the title track by Paul McCartney and the mind-bending ""Soul Finger"" by The Bar-Kays. If these moments were to be found on this disc, the essance of the 'Spies Like Us' experience might remain a little more intact. For any fans of the post-Saterday Night Live era of campy comedies, the light-hearted leitmotifs of this film music master are a worthwhile side trip."
2,Not very strong,"It didn't take too long to install. But the very next day, one corner of the plastic sheet came down. And it's not even windy right now. I hate to think how this will hold up when a cold, windy day comes along. I'm going to try a different brand of double-sided tape to see if the plastic will stick to it. But I shouldn't have to do that."
4,does the job,"I needed to cover two windows in my garage. The garage is not heated, but attached to the house. I am going to heat it with a small heater so I needed to seal up the windows since they are single pane, and have a bit of drafting to the cold air. I bought the patio kit since the other kits would not fit these windows.I previously had bought a kit at a local hardware store for around the same price. Even trying to heat up the trim with a hair dryer I could not get the double sided tape to stick. The trim is painted, and I had cleaned it off. I had no troubles with the 3M tape, it stuck well, went on easy, the paper backing was easy to peel.Since it was in the garage I was not too careful when hanging the plastic and it had quite a bit of wrinkles in it. Once put to heat they all went away, can hardly see the plastic. Only reason for a 4 star is I wish they had more sizes available for ""outdoor"", since i did not use a lot of what this kit had. Will probably buy again next fall."
1,Measure Before Cutting,I bought this product to cover my patio doors in hope of keeping the room warmer during the winter. Never got to use it. When I took the plastic out and measured the size there was only enough material for one door instead of the two doors advertised on the box. I sent it back to Amazon who refunded my money and did not charge for return shipping. I did not repurchase the product so cannot comment on value as a door insulator.
2,very poor accuracy,"I bought this product so i could be more confortable while meassuring appartments *architect*.. In the end.. i had to use my regular measure tape beacuse the laser was not accurate at all!! It did add up , gave cubic measures, calculate everything ok... just with the wrong meassurements. I ended up giving it to my kids as a toy. 5-8 inches mistakes and no way of calibrating the device...."
3,Housekeeping (original movie) EXCELLENT - VHS - not so good,"My favorite movie of all-time was Housekeeping which I saw in the Quad Cinema in New York many years ago. I was very disappointed with the VHS version, however, which cut out some of the most tender and magical moments. It made me feel he just did not even get the movie at all, or even care to."
2,Sexist,"I enjoyed the spirit of this book, the carefree craziness of it. But there was soooo much of it, I never thought it would end. It was a chore to get through. And I know it's sixty years old, but continually reading about women (or ""girls,"" as Kerouac calls them) in the kitchen and the whorehouse is revolting.Natasha HolmeAuthor ofLesbian Crushes and Bulimia: A Diary on How I Acquired my Eating Disorder"
1,Not on the road long enough!!,"It has no plot, the trips [both on the road and drugs] are repetitive, it has no progression of character development, it is indulgent, and poorly written. What more can I condemn? Frankly, I quit after reading about three fourths of it."
1,Terrible for Kindle,"The original scroll, or 'rough draft' as most of us call it, was impossible to read on the Kindle, and I would bet it wouldn't read much better on paper. If you're reading On The Road for the first time, make you sure you buy the version with paragraph and chapter breaks. (Otherwise you'll be wondering why one of the great books of the 20th century is reading like a stream-of-consciousness mess). I don't know if Kerouac wanted the scroll published, but I'm glad there was a readable version. Granted, I'm still getting used to my Kindle."
3,Still reading,"I'm in school so it is hard for me to read for enjoyment. So far the book is good, it's hard to read with the ramblings of the author. The beginning of the actual story was hard to find, I really don't care what other authors think about the book."
1,Not Worth It,"We bought this for our daughter's 8th birthday. It never really worked very well. It just had all-around poor sound quality. Basically, we were disappointed."
2,Less than great,"My main complaint with this book is that the author seems enamoured of his own writing. The chapters on love scenes and sex scenes, for example, essentially consist of nothing but the author's own fiction used as an example--and quite frankly, his sex scenes aren't all that good. In other respects the book is basically mediocre--with nothing you couldn't find in other writing books--and has very little that deals specifically with fantasy and science fiction. That said, some of the advice, particularly the last chapter about not taking yourself seriously until you've written a million words, does ring true."
1,guess what you're buying,"you don't list what size cuisinart it's for: 7, 11, or 14 inch food processor. Who's going to buy an unknown piece of equipment?"
3,"a bit dated, but still good","The policies have changed since this book was written, but still has helpful insight for anyone in the adoption process."
2,Youre not missing anything if you dont have this.,Yeah most people either love this or hate it but I just thought it was alright.It was a mediocre game plain and simple.For one thing the graphics dont look any better than the previous 3D Sonic games.Bright and colofful big deal.Ive seen it before.Controls are alright.Challenge well I have to admit the Dark Team is pretty damn hard but other than that if you want a challenge buy Resident Evil or Ocarina Of Time.Overall this was a very bland game and its a shame that not one decent platform game for this system has come out this year.
4,Finally,"Finally a Sonic game that is ORIGINAL for the 3 major systems right now. I played the demo disc and I enjoyed the new gameplay elements. I have a bad feeling about length of gameplay, but it will be fun while it lasts"
2,Cannot beleive I own this pathetic game!,"Really- it is bad. I'd say Sonic fans may adore it, but if you dont like sonic, you obviously dont like this. The game is messy-everywhere. The only good level is the pinball levels. The rest is just...not to my liking.The graphics are OK on all consoles, but they feel...just not right. dodgy.The sound is complete craze. If you like wierd rhythms and if your a sonic music fan>?? you may like it.The voice acting is purely horrible. Its just not nice to listen to. They just repeat the same things over and over. The worst sound is when the flying characters go 'wee' when they fly. its just nerve wrecking. But again I guess this game is targeting kids more than grown ups. hey, I'm only 15!!The gameplay is just everywhere. Thats a typicall sonic thing. Its not too bad, though.The enemies are ok. Not too hard, not too easy.All in all this game isn't rubbish unless you just dont like sonic. I'd say it is great for any sonic fan, but Its just not right for me."
3,unjustly unjust,"The game in graphics is very good but the problem is that it is for all consoles and them dire because for example series ESPN has been always of PS2, Xbox and because not to remove one for gamecube since they did with Sonic this it seems very unjust to me to nintendo have deceived it had cleared him another star but it is sufficient."
4,Segas done it again!,"This is the coolest game ever! Usually, I don't like sequels to games. But with sonic, it seems like each game is better then the last. The only reason I give this game four stars is because it doesn't have a chao garden. But otherwise it's great!!!!"
4,Classical Hindu Mythology,"Just read the previous review from Norway which does not make much sense to me. This is a lengthy, detailed and dense translation of a wealth of Hindu myths. To my mind it is neither short (373 pages) nor simple, but difficult for the average reader. It reads like a scholarly textbook that requires study to use. I found it fascinating and worth the effort. But I wonder if the previous reviewer and I have read the same book!"
2,Doesn't accomplish much,2 1/2Bit of a toss-off short length is not without merit but is so bare-bones it hardly is worth the trouble. If you enjoyed the pioneering trip-hop producer's continued forays into hip-hop than with low expectations this may appease.
1,Tempest in Eden,"I don't think that she was really up to her regular standard in this book cause it was kinda weird you know, a model and a minister and falling inlove.The book is okay but not like her best in ""exclusive or Eloquent silence"""
1,Cuisinart should STOP making them!,"I ordered this machine on Dec 11 2010, and it failed within a month. Its too badly designed. I used it a few times to chop garlic and herbs. Its a LEMON! I suggest Cuisinart to STOP making it."
1,Awful chopper,"This chopper is absolutely terrible. The blade is sharp and it chops most of the material OK, but it throws some of it up onto the sides and top of the chopping cup where it does not get chopped. The worst is that the top of the chopping cup is part of the motor. You can't put the motor in the dishwasher so you have to hand wipe it down. Therefore this chopper is NOT dishwasher safe. Because the Cuisinart has an awkward assembly with the weight of the motor on top and you can't see all the stuff stuck to the top, you can't just shake stuff down. I will probably throw this in the trash but some of Cuisinart's reputation will be going with it."
2,Not Very Durable,"I bought my first one of these about 10 years ago and used it several times a week, mainly for mincing shallots or herbs. I found it did a fine job on these items, mincing them into fairly uniform, tiny pieces. Contrary to what many other reviewers experienced, I found it very easy to clean. About two years ago, the blade shaft broke in half, rendering it unusable. I did some research and found that it would cost me more to buy a replacement part than to buy an entirely new unit. Which is what I did--and today the blade assembly broke in half on the second one, after only two years of service! Probably needless to say, I will not be buying a third one! I'm very disappointed in Cuisinart, although I've enjoyed my full-size DLC-11 for at least 15 years."
5,Can't cook without it,"I'm blown away by the negative reviews. I've had a Mini-mate for at least 15 years and can't cook without it---in fact, I cook at 3 houses and have bought a Mini-mate for all 3. It's small to store, incredibly easy to use & clean, and ideal for small amounts to be chopped where the same amount would end up on the sides of a regular-sized food processor bowl. Chopping garlic, ginger, nuts, etc. is so fast and easy with this.The ONLY problem I've ever had (& I use one almost every day) is that the plastic housing of the blade breaks so the blade needs replacing; I've had to replace the blade at least 3 times but have never had any problem with the motor. The reviewer who says it turned the food to mush had to have been using the wrong end of the blade; one's for chopping and ones for crushing."
1,"Cheap, and it shows","This is a lesson in why cheap products are wasteful. This chopper is fine for the most part, but apparently the way it prevents being overloaded is by having the blade attachment ""lock"" to the motor shaft via a little bit of plastic that simply breaks if it's put under heavy load. This plastic is part of the motor shaft assembly and appears to be nonreplaceable.In other words, if you use the chopper incorrectly, it will simply break, permanently and irrevocably. And an otherwise perfectly serviceable chopper goes in the trash.What a waste."
2,Lasted less than a week...,"Not worth it. After only using it less than a week, it burned up. All it was used for was grinding up boiled potatoes and carrots for the baby and then it just quit with a strong burning smell. Would not buy another one."
2,Surprise cut!,"I had the same model Cuisinart chopper/grinder before, but after many years of use some of the inner parts came loose and given the low price, I opted for a new one rather than attempting an inept gluing. It came, worked very well on the first try. When I removed the blade to wash it, I touched the blade (as I did many times before on the old one), and my finger began spurting blood copiously. There had been no warning about the sharpness of one (not both) of the blades, and the old blade had not been sharp at all (but still did not job well). After stemming the bleeding and bandaging it, the next day I saw that I had suffered a fairly deep cut. I believe that there should have been a warning in the packaging."
4,too many snow days in ohio...........,"i received this as a feebie from another larger cuisinart purchase on amazon..not sure i would have ordered it myself..however i did use it to make homemade bread crumbs from some stale bread slices..did have to rip the bread into small pieces as the directions indicated, but they came out great. a fun toy..blades are quite sharp, so be careful.clean-up was easy, but this was a dry product."
1,Pass on this one!!,"Threw it in the trash! It was AWFUL!! Horrible to clean, didn't chop right. PASS ON THIS ONE!! Bought an unknown brand for $9.99 and love it!"
2,"Anxiously awaiting ""The Return: part 2"".....","....maybe then we will find out what this one was trying to say.As you can see from the previous reviews this is not a bad film, but it would be nice if it actually had a point."
4,GONE FISHING,"Moody, slow-going and atmospheric Russian film about a man returning to his wife and two sons after a long absence. He takes his sons on a long awaited fishing trip which becomes a strange odyssey of paternal bondage as his interest in the sons reaches psychological tension on the fringes of surrealism. The image of 'father' hangs over this film like a grey Russian sky, and it is only in the reuinion of the three that one understands the absence of the father in the son's lives. The two young actors playing the sons are remarkable, delivering almost uncanny acuracy as embittered and questioning children, but the rather dramatic ending seems an afterthought and besides the point."
4,"Interesting Ideas, but","Like the previous reviewer, I am a fan of Douglas Preston, and the book certainly was an easy read. Also, I enjoyed being exposed to new, thought-provoking ideas like the ones that form the spine of this story. So, if for no other reasons, I would recommend you read this book.However, that said, many parts of the book sharply recall to mind previous passages his other books (Relic, Thunderhead and Codex)that you just have to ignore. You cannot become invested in the characters, they draft too shallow. And a couple of the scenes are entirely too trite (""Don't just follow orders Sgt, think about what you are doing!"")Bottom-line: if you are longing to read a new book, with some escapism and with some thought-provoking science behind it, this is your next order."
1,Better than Crichton???,"Many reviewers compared this novel to Jurassic Park, saying it was a better book than Crichton's. What absurdity. I am not saying that JP is an awesome book, but it was far better than Tyrannosaur Canyon.Tyrannosaur Canyon is a fairly intriguing story, but poorly executed and VERY poorly ended. It's as though Preston suddenly realized that he was going to have to get his characters out of the predicament he had put them in, and didn't know how to do it. The ending is too fast, too unlikely and too unrealistic.The book closes with a theistic comment by one of the characters, which I believe is Preston's way of attempting to belong to both camps, having his science AND being religious.Overall, I had high hopes for this book and I am sorry to say that in the last 100 pages, I was greatly let down."
1,could not even read it...,I was very excited to read this book at first after reading all of the Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston books but I only got a few pages in when this police officer started cussing and using God's name in vain. When will authors realize that Christians read books also? There are very few novels I can read let alone buy any more.
3,Interesting enough,"I really like Preston's writing style a lot. What I don't like are books that leave the ending totally open for the next book. I felt like he didn't finish the story, but what was in this book was intriguing."
4,"If There Are Aliens, They Won't Be Humanoid (Spoilers)","First, I did not read the first book, Codex, because I couldn't get into it. This is a continuation of Tom Broadbent's story. I have a feeling a lot of Tom's development and the relationship with his wife, was done in the first book.That being said, this was a exciting thriller that can stand alone. The good guys are honorable and the bad guys are pure evil. It took a while to figure out (and I wanted to figure it out, which really counts) the prologue scene on the moon and how this relates to a dinosaur hunting in the west. Broadbent finds a body in the desert and of course, trouble. Broadbent makes some really smart moves, but sometimes I think he makes some really sporadic dumb moves. His buddy West, the want-a-be monk, is the brains. I have the next book of this on my shelf. I may even go back and give the first book another try, now that I think about it.P.S. The true hero of the story is the nerdy, overworked under paid scientist."
2,Boring and unoriginal,"Douglas Preston is one of my favorite writers but he has really been slipping lately. Maybe its just me but i don't understand the excitement about finding dinosaur's skeleton. And there is actually a conspiracy and people get killed over that? Oh, please! I can also do without all the descriptions of the canyon and mesas. It seems like there is one every other page-one time would have been enough. I love suspense of his other novels but this one definately a lemon. If i started reading his books with this one, I wouldn't even try reading anything else. I think he is running out of ideas"
1,Preston mailed it in and cashed easy paycheck,"The writing is clearly not as strong when Preston isn't paired with Child. However, Preston took it a step further and just mailed it in for a fast paycheck with this disaster. Everything is implausible from the plot, characters, and their conversations. Unfortunately, I bought 2 other books that Preston wrote without Child. Let's hope he didn't mail it in on those as well and gave some effort."
4,A Great Read!,"I really enjoyed this book! As always, the author is a superb story-teller. The drama, the plot twists, the writing - all are superb and well researched. As with most books by Preston Douglas, I finished the book and still wanted more."
3,Good but short,"Both kids, 5 and 2, enjoyed this on our recent car trip but it seemed like it was over before it started. It is a wonderful concept and there are many, many more cultures that could have been explored so it really seemed too short to appreciate. If you don't mind that, it is a nice educational show."
2,dont waste your money,I would not reccomend this at all. many better choices out there. they over complicate the system and the whole thing is how to kick someone in the balls. very unreal life situations. dont follow this it will get you hurt or worse. in one seen the femail beats up a bg with a water bottle that was at least funny to watch.
5,Strong Box!,"This case fit my ipac hx2410 perfectly. The pda is just as easy to use as it ever was, but heavily protected by the aluminum case. Yee Haw! I don't have to worry about someone accidentaly stepping on my Ipac anymore... and I have two extra SD slots in the cover to save my extra SD flash cards."
3,Revolution Revisited,"There are not many movies about the American Revolution. Beyond The Patriot, The Crossing and a few others, one has to search pretty hard to find a movie that encompasses both the political and military aspects. Revolution was made 25 years agao and does have that dated feeling with the musical score and camera angles, but the battle scenes and historical setting are as well done as if the movie were made today. It is a bit difficult to get past Al Pacuino in this role. You keep seeing Michael Corleon or some other NYC tough guy. Although the picture was not well received when first released, it is a worthwhile film with both entertaining and historical value."
1,AMERICAN REVOLUTION + AL PACINO = FAILURE!,"This film is TERRIBLE! What in the name of George Washington were these people thinking. This film is long, dull, stupid, and historically inaccurate! The most accurate thing about the film: The two seconds between the Warner Bros. sign and the opening credits. Pacino as an Irishman was TERRIBLE! Sutherland as the British Bad Guy: Not given enough time on the screen. Do not watch unless you want to be bored to death! Watch THE PATRIOT instead. At least you'll get a feel of what the American Revolution MEANT and how it FELT to be there! Grade: F"
1,is there a better movie depicting the American Revolution?,If it was not for my history instructor making me watch this movie and write and essay about it I would never have watched this movie! This movie was terrible. It was not easy to follow. And how is it that Daisy and Dobbs seeing each other one time suddenly want to get married? What is this all about???? Give me a break. Major thumbs down on this flick!!!
2,Terrible,"Dis the Patriot if you like but it is ten times this film this rotten tomato could ever be. It had potential, it had actors, it had a ""feel"" of the times but plot, dialogue, character development or simple interest it had not. And what was with that goober on Donald Sutherland's face?However, there is one assault scene during the battle on Long Island that is the most accurate portrayal of British open field tactics I have ever seen. Hardly enough to save the film. Take a pass on this one."
1,Seriously?,Why would you buy the episodes to watch on your computer when you can just goto Spike T.V.s website and watch it for free??? If you buy this you're just dumb...
4,A bit of a thinking book,"[For context's sake, I have been reading the Discworld books in publication order. Feet of Clay is #19.]Very intriguing, with great development of some core recurring characters. The interplay between characters led to some really interesting insights into subjects like racism, wealth and entitlement, the nature of life, morality, and projected morality. While it wasn't a book that had me sitting on the edge of my seat, it kept my mind engaged and pondering, and the characters and dialogue were brilliant, as always."
2,Very disappointing !,"""The new negotiating egdge"", a title that was for me a promise for new ideas, new concept, new material and... just a rehash of what's has been said already (with other words). Disappointing !"
3,Should have been better,"Weak presentation of a great story. The acting is fine, but the script is lacking. The movie lacks the passion and inspiration it should have had. It's a shame that a shallow script makes you think ""Gee, that's nice"" instead of ""Wow!"" at what these kids accomplished. Renaissance Man and Lean On Me give much better presentations of a similar theme."
2,not worth it,"we got these because they were microwave safe. tis is true and great, but the suction cup is worthless and medium and small bowl are too tiny."
2,suction bowls,"While the idea is great, the suction doesn't stay stuck half the time - even after moistening the suction cup. It's also a pain to swap the suction between the bowls. I'd rather just have each bowl with its own suction. The bowls are still useful as bowls themselves and the suction is hit or miss. Mostly miss. The lids are nice and the bowls are cute. Those are the only reasons I didn't give this item 1 star."
2,Not moved,I tried to like this CD. I went out and purchased it on the release date. I understand that this project is some of his unreleased music....I really am having a hard time adjusting to the lack of specialness I know that anthony can bring. The worst songs are with Sunshine Anderson who talk sings through the song and just tears my ears apart. Macey Gray sounds like a drunk two year old. I love the passion of Anthony and I love his voice and I know the third album will be better than this. PLEASE let it be better.
4,Anthony Hamilton - Coming From Da Ole Skool,"and thanks to Rupert (reviewer) for enlightening me on the origins of this CD.I found it mellow, quality material, which is what is to be expected from AH, whether on his own or guest appearing on someone's else's project. This artist is quality through and through ... no need to wonder if your money will be wasted, because it will not. I didn't, however, love it like I did Coming From Where I'm Coming From; but it is not disappointing. My favorite: Keeper! The whole CD is growing on me more and more daily; buy it. Don't waste time."
5,MasterPiece,This is certainly better than his 1st CD by far. Those music execs were certainly sleeping on this one. It's funny they thought we were not going to feel this.....shame on them. Mr. Hamilton's Soul is certainly indescribable!! I love this guy!!
1,Great features and poor performance,"I purchased this phone with 3 extensions based on the company's reputation and the array of nice features. Unfortunately the phone system behaved in unpredictable, erratic ways and require lot of time for debugging. For example, the answering machine would stop picking-up for no apparent reason. Technical support did their best - but after resetting the whole system and still having problems, I have gave up, swapped it for the similar Panasonic system that so far has performed superbly."
5,great scent,bought this for my 18 year old son after his dad had picked it up on the east coast on a cruise - he thinks it is a great scent
2,price is right,"We have several travel cases for toddler utensils - this case, and the utensils, are my least favorite. The tines on the fork are so wide that my 15-month-old can't stab anything with it. She does like the spoons. Because the handles on these utensils are a bit longer than most toddler utensils, it makes it easy for her to grab the handle of the spoon while I help guide the spoon to her mouth. The case is large and takes up too much space in our diaper bag, so we haven't used it outside our house. Like other reviewers, I could only get 6 of the 8 utensils in the case at the same time. For just a few dollars, the price is right since we use only the 4 spoons. I would trash the forks and find another use for the case. I would not recommend this product to a friend."
3,Misleading order page!,"I ordered this for my wife, and believed the ""Frequently bought together"" note on the order page. I ordered all 3 items, and they came separately. First came the disks, and the next day, one of the pedicure machines. Today, the last of the 3 items arrived, and lo and behold, it is the SAME pedicure machine! The small photos show what appear to be different machines, but they are identical! Very sneaky!"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Catwoman has reevaluated her existence, and has come down on the side of becoming a protector of her part of town. So, she is not happy with drug dealers using kids as part of their operation, or when Holly, a friend of hers, is framed on a murder charge.She becomes a very busy feline of the night trying to get all this sorted out."
3,nice for the fans,"Mietta likes exploring different styles, but the result is not always completely satisfactory.Mia Anima still contains some great songs but the overall impression is not as positive, and far from previous masterpeices such as Laciamoci Respirare.Not my favourite Mietta album."
1,Save Your Money!,"I purchased this book hoping to get little glimpses into the life of Pope John Paul II before he became Pope. What I got was the story of Poland during WW II. Very, very disappointing."
3,Workout review,"I've got to say that the interaction between these two women is a little creepy. ""Always"" ""Perfect"" ugh. That said, I tune it out, listen to music and the workout is as good as you want to make it."
1,Boring,The workout is boring and unchallenging. It has a lot of chit-chat with her and her trainer tossing back and forth compliments to each other. I would not buy it again and I may never even watch it again.
5,A Book To Make You Sing,"Real Karaoke People adds deeply to the great body of Asian American poetry in a way that remains socially conscious and artistically relevant.Epic and humane, Ed Bok Lee's poetry shines through with poems that feel personal and universal, without reducing itself to expected stereotypes or the tired tropes we've received from other poets.Many of the pieces reveal his experience as a spoken word artist and performing poet, but they make the transition to page easily and resonate with a thoughtful energy crouching, ready to pounce at your throat like a rare wildcat.Only a few of the poems feel shoe-horned into the text, and when you step away, you can still feel them lingering, and if they feel isolated, perhaps that too, is a more deliberate decision than one might expect.Real Karaoke People has tremendous soul and it is worth bringing his work to classrooms and other textbooks as a great example of what contemporary Asian American poets are doing today."
4,"Sure its out of date, but its still nice","Can't get enough FLW pictures? There's a few more here. I appreciate the publisher's review giving us facts about the calendar. Meanwhile, it has a nice sorta see through cover with apparently his signature on it for the cover. The pictures typically take up about 2/3 or a bit more of the page each is on. I'm glad I bought it here. It's not for everyone unless yer a FLW nut. It's quite nice really."
3,Really a two-star disappointment,"This novella gets one star for poor writing and 3 stars for an okay story. The editing and proofing earn a minus one because there are too many typos/misspellings and no one told Alexander that there isn't enough emotion to grab the reader and pull us into the story - which is pedestrian. Alexander deserves her ""props"" for giving us a young, black, professional lesbian. Unfortunately, I could care less what happens to her."
2,Does not work only after 2 months of use,"Bought this cable in December 2011 and used it to connect my second monitor to the desktop. Worked great for 2 months. Suddenly the screen went blank and so I checked the cables with another monitor to see if there was a problem with the monitor, but the screen would not respond saying no signal. Finally figured that the cable was dead, that too only after 2 months of use"
3,Does not support all DVI capable montors.,"This product is well built and was shipped on a timely basis. The low price was fantastic. But it did not work in my two year old Samsung monitor. I have newer Samsung monitor that I purchased this year, and it works fine on it so I'm satisfied. But buyers need to beware that this cable may not work on all monitors that have a DVI port."
3,Decent Connection,not the prettiest packaging but it does the job. the screw fasteners are a little flimsy tho.
2,Low quality cable,"This cable only works for me at low resolutions, up to 1024x768. At higher resolutions, especially 1920x1200 (the native resolution of my display), it produces flickering green pixels and other artifacts. More problematic, the monitor often loses sync and blacks out for a second or so. This is often frequent enough that the display is downright unusable.I suspect that this is because of insufficient shielding or bad cable design, rather than a single defective cable, since there are other reviews similar to mine.At least in my case, you get what you pay for. Not recommended."
3,WHAT'S WRONG WITH JUST D&B,AK1200 IS AWESOME IN THIS ONE. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS MC NAVIGATOR. IF I WAS THERE IN CONCERT I WOULDN'T MIND IT SO MUCH. BUT THE MC DROWNS OUT AK TO MUCH. IT IS LIKE THAT FOR THE ENTIRE CD.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I ordered this book and promptly returned it. Normally, I am a fan of Cahan's work, but this was nothing like the clean, intuitive style I have grown accustomed to seeing from his office. And, that is not to say change is not good. It just so happens, this one isn't."
3,Too Short.,"THE THREE MUSKETEERS is the soundtrack (not score) to the recently released Disney DVD. To save a bit of money, all the songs but one are set to the tunes of classical music. The last song on the disc, ""Three Is a Magic Number"" is a remade pop version of a very similar song done on School House Rock years ago. Overall, I thought the people who put the lyrics together did a good job. The gimmick of updating classic tunes could have been a disaster, but it isn't: it works rather well. Unfortunately, the album is really short (around 15 minutes) and the most memorable tune is the one pop tune (""Three Is a Magic Number""). That aside, though, the music isn't bad and is something that kids will enjoy listening to."
5,Great controller,I purchased two of these for our PS2. We have cheap ones and Sony brand. We've had them and used them a lot for over a year and they are still the best controllers we own.
4,two of the all time greatest on this song,i use to dig we didn't know. Whitney vocally was on a whole different level and then you have one half of the crown of King of Music in Brother Stevie Wonder. there voices sound fantastic together. i still bump to this cut. i remember when they turned out the Arsenio Hall show with there performance of this song. two of the baddest talents ever.badd soul sister and a badd soul brother.
2,Poor Design,The overall design is the worst. It's impossible to thoroughly clean the inside since the only access is through the spout. I've also experienced problems with removing the whistle (gets hot) and with the decorative ball falling off. I would not recommend this kettle.
3,"Surprisingly decent, once the action starts","I borrowed this and read it in a day, because, well, I had to go back to school.Amazingly enough, I did enjoy this, up to a point. After the ""gimme"", it sets up an interesting premise (which I won't bother going into). Unfortunately, the dialogue and writing are atrocious, for the most part. I'm fairly sure real people did not and do not speak the way they do in this novel. Also, the writers are rather tech-happy, too much so for their own good.Now, the saving grace in this book is the raid on Oak Ridge. Forschten/Gingrich wrote this very well, and I was deeply impressed. I also thought the political element (i.e. the locals taking to arms to defend against the raid) were nicely put, but not obtrusive.It is unfortunate that the sequel, Fortress America, never found a publisher. Oh, well. Maybe in a few years, it will."
2,A book by Newt that other conservatives might want to ban!,"The scariest words in the entire book are at the end - ""To Be Continued."" It rates a 3 only because it's an amusing story; not because it's good. The authors, both of whom should know better, have produced a book that's laughable rather than frightening. From the plugs for George Bush to the praise of Prussian Character, it seems to fawn over just about everyone. The bad guys are too busy screwing up to be bad, and the sexual habits of one of the Nazis are just twisted enough that hard-core conservatives will probably want to see the book banned"
2,Got weird,"The book started out interesting enough however it just became unrealistic. I understand that alternative history is supposed can push the envelope but this book just became strange. WWI vet Alvin York happens to be near by during the final battle? Please. Also, it was as if the authors went out of their way just to pepper the book with historical characters but they never were really relevant. The Patton exchange was pointless. Plus, it was evident that the authors used the movie ""Patton"" for the line ""paperhanging...""Newt's other book about Pearl Harbor was much better."
3,Another view of WW II,"As an alternate history Newt and Mr. Fostchen do an adequate job. Interesting concept and ideas combined with good interplay of facts and fiction. The Otto Skorzeny character is rich in development but the protagonist, James Martel, is weak and could use a little more depth. The battle scenes were adequate while the strategy and tactics OK. All in all an average alternate history novel. I was a little surprised when on the last page it said ""To be Continued"" only to find out that it was not. The future possibilities were interesting but alas not pursued. No gratuitous sex or violence.Recommendation: Get it at the local library as it is very difficult to find."
4,We need the sequel,This is a very entertaining read. I really hate that the sequel has not been forthcoming. The main character in this book reminds me of a Chuck Norris-type character a la Invasion USA or Missing in Action. I think the scenario seemed possible given the exact circumstances described in the book and I would like to know the ending of the story. I want to encourage the authors to make the sequel an ebook like Stephen King has done if the publisher still refuses to publish the sequel.
1,immortality,Terrible!.reeks of proven faulty Adventist theology...SOUL SLEEP is totally uinbiblical!Sammy should have stayed in the Vatican with his Catholic buddies!.
5,Has worked great for years.,I've been using it for several years to connect a computer to my tv. It outputs a clean 720p or 1080p picture to the tv and it hasn't fallen apart or caught on fire.
2,Did not ship with a ferrite bead.,"The packaging looks okay. The connectors do not come with any protective plastic covers. Most importantly, it did not have any ferrite beads on the ends as mentioned in the description.The ferrite beads were important to me. Amazon gave me a $3 partial refund on the product (thanks to Amazon)."
4,I have it.,"This cable arrived on time and looks to be of excellent quality. Unfortunately for me, I have not been able to get it to work with my receiver. I don't believe that is the cables fault but I put it out there anyway."
4,This thing works,"This cable works. Nothing fancy, but it was cheap and arrived on time. Using it for a while now, and no problems."
2,"Worked for a year, then went bad",Purchased from eForcity in December 2008. Paid 2.98 + shipping for a total of $5.91.I used this with a top-of-the-line Sony HDTV. It worked great at first but after a year or so it began to flicker. Now it is junk. Picture goes in and out when plugged in with the slightest movement of computer. I wouldn't buy this brand again without some sort of warranty.
4,Worked as expected,I was able to successfully connect a DVI monitor to the HDMI connection on computer. No other setup was required.
1,Beware - questionable construction!,"I bought this saute pan two years ago. It has not seen heavy use in that time. This evening as I heated the pan over the stove - preparing to sear a steak - I heard a strange pop. I picked up the pan and discovered that several layers of the ""copper sandwich bottom"" had completely separated from the pan. The pan is ruined. I will aviod Cuisinart's cookware and all ""copper sandwich"" construction pans in the future."
5,this cookware is divine!,"This is my first piece of Cuisinart Everyday cookware and I am truly amazed! I cooked spaghetti and (meatless) meatballs and there was no scorching or discoloration. I love it, and hope to build a full set of it. If it has a downside, it is not as pretty as All-Clad or some of the other high end stuff, but I do love the fact that it has NO ALUMINUM CONTENT! Very hard to find in any cookware, high or low-end."
4,Ten Early Hitchcock Movies Recorded In EP Mode,"These are ten early classic Alfred Hitchcock B&W movies all produced in the 1930s. Each film is close to 1 1/2 hours in length. Unfortunately, the VHS was recorded in EP mode so the quality of the reproduction suffers. However, since the films are all B&W that is not much of a problem. The price is right as the ten movies are available at around $15."
1,Madacy - worst DVD producer ever,"The editorial review from Amazon.com states, ""The prints of the films used in this box set are serviceable and probably comparable to average 16mm classroom or museum presentations."" All I can think is that Mr. Keogh is lying or didn't actually watch the discs. The transfers are among the worst ever on DVD, which is typical of all Madacy titles. The films on the discs are unfortunately great - too bad they're unwatchable. Avoid this collection like the plague, and wait for re-releases from reputable distributors."
5,Sterling silver heart anklet,"Anklet was very pretty and shined in the sun, quality is very impressive and with stood the pounding of the waves. All-in-all, I recommend this product to anyone, the price is right and the product is gorgeous!"
3,Strange knowing the songs and lyrics,"This is strange to me. I love classical and, well... all kinds of music! (Aerosmith rock on!) The music is very nice but I'm just still trying to link Alanis' ""Jagged Little Pill"" songs - especially ""You Ought to Know"" to a string quartet re-do.It's just difficult for me to wrap my head around how passionately she sang each song... being redone by a string quartet.Kinda like redoing Led Zeppelin in opera. Sorta. Just weird!!"
3,elevator mechanic,"In general I found this book to be useful as a ""warm up"" for taking an entry exam.However, the book does not have a table of contents. Inside there are groups and versions of exam questions. The answers are found after a number of tests.I found that going through each test followed by checking the answers before proceeding to the next test was a helpful prep. The tests are not identified; it was necessary to keep bookmarking places.I do not recommend this book for learning the trade in any way. Similar questions may have different answers when the question reappears in another exam. I only used this book as a way to get ready for the entrance exam.All in all: thumbs up!"
1,"WHOA, PEOPLE!","FROM HIS PHONEY-BALONEY ACCENT, TO HIS OVERBLOWN INSTRUMENTATION, JOHNNY DOWD IS THE WORST...TIRING, TUNELESS SONGS, PREDICTABLE LYRICS AND SOPHOMORIC ""MUSICAL"" MEANDERINGS...I WOULDN'T MENTION T.W. OR H.W. ON THE SAME WEBSITE WITH THIS CLOWN...HE SHOULD HAVE KEPT DOING WHATEVER HE WAS DOING BEFORE HE STARTED DOING THESE LOUSY ALBUMS...MAYBE HE WAS GOOD AT THAT..."
5,Maiden must wear,"Excellent cap, takes away the chill from your head. Very good quality,,I purchased two of them just incase, these items can no longer be found ."
5,A captivating read,I love this book and the intro to Wilsons rapairman Jack.I found myself not wanting to put this book down and go to bed instead.F Paul Wilson is a great story teller
2,Yawn,After hearing a great deal of hype about this author I decided to try THE KEEP. What a letdown that was. I decided to try this Repairman Jack character out. Letdown #2. I think it's safe to say I won't be picking up another F. Paul Wilson book anytime soon.
2,"Has possibilities, but ultimately dissappointing","The Repairman Jack novels and The Tomb have an interesting central concept and character. Due to this, I found myself hoping the plot would improve, that the rough spots in the storytelling would disappear. Unfortunately this did not happen. Jack's love interest and on again off again girlfriend is a poorly constructed character that is impossible for me at accept as real. If you're really interested, try jumping ahead to one of the later novels in the series. Maybe they improved with practice. I could not bring myself to make the investment of my time."
4,Interesting,A former high school friend of mine recommended this series of novels to me to satisfy my search for more entertaining science fiction characters of this world and beyond
1,Napoli Aren't As Beautiful With All the Chips !,"They ARE so beautiful, and because of their beauty were even more of a disappointment and waste of money. I usually check reviews, and did not check before I purchased these dishes. Boy, I wish I would have! I have had these dishes less than 90 days, and 7 pieces out of 32 are chipped, some large and some small. We haven't handled them roughly, and Pfaltzgraff said while they are ""chip resistant "" , if you bump them ""hard"" enough they will chip. I can tell you we have not only not bumped them "" hard"", they have not knowingly been bumped at at all. My husband handwashed one last night, this morning I picked it up off the dishtowel and a huge nickle size chunk is just laying there. I would guess it is the poor quality crafmanship coming from all of the "" Made in China "" products of today. nothng is made to last and even the corporations customer service seem to consider everything a "" throw away."" Do not waste your enthusiasm, time or money ."
1,would you like a little mold with your meal?,"I purchased two sets of this heavy, easily chipped dinnerware but the worst thing is that it retains moisture leaving rings on my dining table! Most appallingly, even after thoroughly drying them, they collect mold on the undersides!! Calls and emails to Platzgraff customer service were not returned so I'm assuming they are aware of the design flaw or don't care about their customers. I had to throw them all away."
1,Napoli is junk......every piece I own is chipped..........,"Years ago, I purchased two different sets of dishes (years apart) from Pfaltzgraff and was very pleased. When my granddaughter came to live withus, we again found ourselves in a large home and needed new dishes to go along with our new home. I loved the looks of NAPOLI and bought servicefor 12, with all serving pieces, creamer, sugar bowl etc.....even bought the glasses. After about two weeks, EVERY glass broke in the dishwasher,and just about every serving piece has been chipped. We are NOT hard on our belongings. I think the china is very cheaply made ...NOT the qualitythat was there years ago. Never will I buy from this company again.....no matter the cost!"
1,They should we put out of business for ripping so many poeple off,"This is horrible do not buy .they are not for microwave and they just chip ,chip and chip no matter how careful you are with them.I spent a lot of money on everything that went with this set,and completely remodeled my kitchen to match and we have been using paper plates to scared to even touch these dishes.I am now ordering the corelle dishes because I am sick of spending so much money on paper plates. Shame on this company I hope they get rich quick because it is going to hurt them selling crap like this. They make you put a star but it needs five thumbs down."
3,shaun palmers,I rented this game and enjoyed playing it. So i bought it. The levels are very big and have a lot of things to do in them. Which is different than all of the other snowboarding games. It was a to hard though. I couldnt even get pasted the 2nd level. The music is by far the best out of every other video game!! I ended up taking the game back just because it was so hard. The buttons are also way to easy. It is practically impossible to do a backflip while just snowboarding along. Which you can do in this game. I am a snowboarder and this game is way to unreal! I would recomend renting this game before buying it!!
2,User Unfriendly,"I just bought this and I am taking it back, I think this thing is way too user unfriendly. It takes a long time to figure out how to do anything on this. To save a station # takes three steps. Their are too many buttons on the remote. I accidentally turned off the display, it took 1/2 hour to figure out how to get it back. For example, I have not figured out how to use the tape monitor function yet. Even simple things like changing a station, you have to go through a seek function, it takes forever to get to the other end of the numbers (maybe there is an easier way, but it is not obvious). The instructions are not helpful. This thing is very annoying because it is so hard to figure out how to do anything. The sound is good though."
5,damaged twice in shipment,"Dear Amazon,We think the product will be excellent, but it has been damaged twice in shipping so we haven't been able to use it.Thank you"
3,Doesn't do what it says on the tin,"This is a very good double CD, but unfortunately, according to the brief notes that come with the set, less than half the tracks are by Bix. CD1 has 12 out of 20 by Bix and CD2 has none of its 20 tracks by Bix."
3,Packaging major problem,"I'm sure the compressor will prove to be a great reliable workhorse, fired it up and it's not too loud, held the pressure. My problem has been receiving 3 damaged compressors. The plastic guard around the motor is always cracked and the mounting bolts have been jarred loose leading me to think that if bump that broke the plastic guard was big enough to jar the bolts what else is damaged? Dewalt, whats the problem with using a better packing method? Other companies seem to have it down, especially Bosch. Extra thick cardboard and a few pieces of styrofoam please!"
2,so-so,"Well, it sounds like a recording of an old radio program, which I guess it is. Doesn't capture the Howard's range on his better old recordings and doesn't have the great ""To Each His Own."""
5,delighful taste!!!,"this crunchy granola is the best tasting,that i have had in a long time,cruchy clusters with a hint of honey and hazel nut flavor,plus the great taste of strawberries and rasberries.great as a healthy breakfast or snack,pluse put a little of this on vanilla yougurt!!! it will leave you wanting more,i will buy again."
2,Not Worth the Money or the Time :-(,"When I first heard of this Supercar Street Challenge, I thought the concept was wonderful: go racing in concept/rare cars in major cities around the world. However, the game is VERY lacking in terms of graphics, and the cities do have a ""feel"" to them. Specifically, having lived in Paris, I was extremely disappointed; the Paris circuit neither ""feels"" nor looks anything like Paris. I have never been to Los Angeles, but the LA river circuit has even LESS ""feel"" than its counterpart in Rumble Racing!!!This may well be a good game for young children, as they will probably not be as concerned with look and ""feel."" However, games such as F1 2001 and Gran Turismo 3 have really set a high bar for racing games, and Supercar Street Challenge can barely even get off the ground in comparison to these PS2 gems."
3,Self-destructive,"Fiamma has lots of talent and good ideas that are undermined by the overwhelming electronic bass beat on some songs, overreliance on bagpipes, and her sticking to the cool European disco sound. The current band is good (part on this CD) and their shows are better than this (4/05). She would be well served to let go and lett her natural, acoustic talent and emotions come through more."
5,Great solution,"Ordered these because the clips I was using were not terribly effective and kept breaking. These are excellent, great for bigger bags. Seal really well and seem virtually indestructible."
1,Won't work on P880,"I purchased these lenses and they did not work on my P880. They crop the corners very badly and I tried many changes with the set up. The seller was very good and issued me a RMA. I was refunded the price of the lenses; however, not the shipping costs from and back to them."
4,I beg to differ,"I think that the illustrations were 1st rate. As I was in the Army during the ""Army Of Excellence"", I thought Mr. Rottman had a couple of good points. But I also think that some of the problems faced by the Officers Corp should of been addressed like the zero defect mentality and the fear of making a mistake by Junior Officers. Also the up and out program that has a very bad effect on the ethical standards of Army Leadership which fosters way too much careerism in my humble ex enlisted man opinion."
5,"Soup pot.Sturdy bottom, perfect size, in performance no stick.",I have just said it in title. PLease Cuisinart make this soup pot available again. perfect gift as well.
3,great reference - cd is pretty worthless,"this book is a great reference for those who deal in any way with the human form. i, for example, am a 3d character animator and this book is perfect for nailing correct human proportions and visualizing range of motion. however, the accompanying cd is basically an advertisement for ErgoForms, the autocad version of the drawings in the book. only the 1% man drawing (the smallest average male figure)is included on the cd, which is pretty useless for what i need. if the book weren't so expensive i'd give it a four star rating. i thought i was getting more on the cd to warrant the price."
4,Good for girls too!,While shopping for a digger toy for my daughter I got tired of hearing how great the toys were for boys. They are building a house behind us and my daughter loves watching the big machines. So I bought this digger. This is a perfect toy for a toddler. It is durable and safe for the little ones with rounded corners and no small parts. My only complaint is that the driver is a little tough to put in place due to the black cage around the driver's seat. But my daughter is starting to figure it out.
1,So Sad,"I am one of the early Chenoweth fans. Her TV show, Charlie Brown, Wicked, and her first album, were soooo fab. How did she wind up dong an album even Kathie Lee Griffin would be ashamed of?"
3,"I love Chenoweth, but this album....","Okay, 5 stars for talent, 1 star for music selection. And that one star is only because of ""Taylor, the Latte Boy,"" which is a lot of fun. I respect the fact that Kristin chose to express her faith through music, but of all the music to pick, why this selection? It's dull, it certainly doesn't showcase her amazing voice, and many of the songs sound very similar to one another. I'm a huge fan of Chenoweth...I think I own almost every CD she's ever been in, and I saw WICKED just because of her. (Although I have to say that Menzel rocks, too!) I loved ""Let Yourself Go,"" which has become a listening staple in my car, and I was so excited when she released this. The only song I really LOVE to listen to is the last track, ""Taylor, the Latte Boy."" I can't wait for her next album....as long as it has a little more ""Kristin Pizzazz!!"" :)"
4,Fantastic Buy,"I have really enjoyed using this transmitter. The only problem I've had is that it has HORRIBLE reception during heavy rain. Being that I don't drive in heavy rain often, I don't see that as enough of a negative to not like the transmitter. I just flip the radio on for those trips."
4,Simple and functional,I've tried several different FM transmitters and this is the only one I've found that is both reasonably priced and works very well.
2,Kind of crappy,"Sound quality is ok but has a tendency to be static-y, especially if it is accidentally bumped, which can happen often if you have a car with a manual transmission. From the other reviews, most FM transmitters tend to be mediocre at best and this is no exception."
2,does not last,Product stopped working after about 3 months of use and I rarely actually used it. The extra plug in for the charger was very flimsy and would wobble a lot when plugged in. It worked pretty good when it did work.
2,Poor reception if the antenna in your car is on the back,"I was very excited about using this to connect my android phone and listen to Pandora in the car. However, the sound quality was very poor (and I picked a frequency that had no interference whatsoever). Based on other reviews, I thought the sound was going to be much better. I can only think that the antenna is on the back of my car, and the transmitter does not have enough power. If your antenna is closer to the transmitter you might be luckier, but for me it does not do much."
2,Doesn't Work,"Worked for 5 minutes, then it blew the fuse. Upon replacement, fuse blew again. I have contacted seller for replacement, so we'll see how that goes. For the 5 minutes that it worked, the sound is about as good as FM (not CD quality)."
2,Worked OK for a hot second,"This unit worked OK for a little while. Sure, I would get staticky interference from my stations, but in a car that provided me no other options, it did allow me to use my phone hands-free and listen to internet radio off my cell. Then, within a matter of weeks, I noticed that I couldn't hear anything. I soon realized the unit had developed a short. So now I'm back to where I was before. Two stars because it did give me some hope. It's just not sturdy enough."
1,FAIL! DO NOT PURCHASE,"Ignore my previous post. I am extremely dissatisfied with this product. It has been a little more than a month that I have purchased this and it has already broken down on me. I took extreme care of it, I would unplug it when it was not in use and it just stopped working out of no where. At first I didn't mind the little static noise it would make, but later it just got plain annoying and I would have to constantly adjust the sound on my device and car radio. I would buy this for no more than ten dollars. extreme rip off."
2,Not recommended,Sound quality is BAD. You notice how bad it is when a song has several instruments playing at the same time.
1,Coby CA-745 not well made - broke soon after first used.,The Coby CA-745 broke the first time I used the feature that allows you to plug a dc adapter into it.
2,Coby CA-745 review,"This product does indeed work but it is very fragile I advise buyers to NOT use the plug pass through because it will blow the circuits in the device and then its worthless. But the FM transmission is very strong even over weak stations it comes through clear and through any FM channel. This puts the battery powered FM transmitter I was using to shame. I only gave it four stars because the product contains lead in the wiring otherwise it is a five star product. (The first unit blew a fuse or something when I tried to use the plug pass through, Amazon return service was amazingly fast and courteous, five stars to them!)(Update: This product self destructed after about a good six months of use, this time it just sort of split in half. I would like to officially revise my initial review and give it a two star rating.)"
5,Clear sounding from over 10m away,It is so clear sounding and was a great price. On a recent trip I took My brother and I took seaperate cars and he was behind me the whole way and could hear my song section perfectly clear! At one point he was over 15m away! Delivered very quickly also and a very convenient shape
4,Works well,A really good transmitter for the price. It is pretty clear for playing straight from my phone. I reall like the way the display allows me to change frequencies when necessary.
5,Get what you pay for,"This is a great product for the price. Yes there is some static, but it also depends what station you use, as some have more static than others. It's perfect to play my iPod in my car and I really can't complain because I knew it wouldn't be 100% perfect. I recommend this product to anyone who doesn't have an AUX plug-in in their car but still want to play music off their phone, tablet, iPod, MP3 player or whatever. The only thing I recommend is to buy this and some sort of mount as well, because I get annoyed with my iPod sliding all over my passenger seat or taking up my sole cupholder in my vehicle."
5,Coby CA-745 Wireless FM Car Transmitter,My husband loved this ! He has been wanting to get this for him and our daughter for his car and they both love it!
5,Only one I've ever liked,This is the only external FM Modulator I've ever purchased that worked well. I have now given both of them away as I have cars with external inputs but these guys rocked!
2,Stopped working completely after 2 months only!,This wireless FM transmitter worked as advertised only for about two months. Then it stopped working completely. Both the charger and the display died suddenly. Apparently this happens often.
2,Lots of Static,I don't know what the deal is but there is a lot of static on this thing. I've tried changing stations and moving the device and my iphone to different locations but static is always present.
2,??????????????????????????????,Maybe it was a defective item but my coby FM transmitter didn't work in the least i tried about 25 different stations and everyone was static/buzzing.
3,Broke after owning just one year,"I was really pleased with this FM transmitter for the first year. Although it kind of pops out of the cigarette lighter unexpectedly sometimes because of the springs. I was even more unhappy with the fact that one day I plugged it in and it just broke into pieces. Not sure why, because it didn't give me any signs that it was damaged. So now I have to buy another. I would suggest buying one that is more sturdy because I am disappointed to have to purchase another one."
3,Try it and hope it works. When it worked it was great.,"I read the reviews before I bought the Coby CA-745 transmitter. I saw that there were a few people who were disappointed that it didn't work after a while. I took a chance that maybe mine might be fine. The price is right, so why not try. I used it about six times with no issues. I was so happy to have all my music with me. About the seventh time, I noticed that the volume was very low. The next time I plugged it in, and all I heard was static. My player was showing that it was playing, but there was nothing coming out of my speakers. I tried a couple more times to no avail. It's worth it to give it a try."
1,Stopped working after less than 2 months,"Everything worked fine with this transmitter at first- it was a little bulky and not that attractive but it did the job. However, in less than 2 months it simply stopped working. As it was over the 30 day return policy deadline, there is nothing we can do but throw it away (it's not worth sending to the manufacturer). I would not recommend this product."
5,best unit for this ive bought,"I have tried several other radio tuners like this and they always have lots of interference. Ive had interference on rare occasion when traveling, but 99% of the time its perfect. Would buy again."
3,Works for a good few years,"I bought this October 2010. It worked pretty well and functioned as advertised. Went through about 4 fuses to keep it going over those two years and it kept on working until the 5th where it finally just stopped working with a fresh fuse.Major con was trying to use the extra charging port on it. Would cause interference immediately, so it was pretty useless to use as a charger and transmitter at the same time.It feels cheap, but for the price, it's expected. I'm definitely looking for something better now, but for the price, it did the job."
3,Just Ok,"Worked in my boyfriend's car. Doesn't work in my 2005 chevy equinox. Sounds like the radio which is slighlty annoying, but better than nothing (horrible to the point of being unusable in my equinox)."
2,"Price good, faulty product",The price is good but you get what you pay for. Every time you touch the connector you get terrible feedback.
4,Works good for a low-end transmitter.,"This is my second Coby CA-745, the first one I ordered accidentally got left in the car for a few nights in Anchorage during December. The -20F temperature ruined this thing, so don't be an idiot and leave it out in the extreme cold.That being said, I liked the first one well enough to order another and I've been pleased with both. The quality is quite decent, I rarely have signal interference even living in a congested area. The spiral cord is nice too, it takes up very little space.The one issue I have with this thing is that when you turn the car off and leave, the adapter stays on, so make sure to unplug the adapter when you leave the car. This is a significant annoyance but not enough to put me off from the product.Overall, if I'm dumb enough to leave this thing out in the cold again and ruin it, I'll buy another."
1,Broke after a week.,"I bought this and loved it, then after a week, it stopped working. Now whenever I plug it into my car, it lights up for a second then constantly turns off."
2,"works, but the wire breaks internally","Eventually after a year or so, the coiled connecting wire will break down internally and one of the conductors will short out. This cable also includes a wire that serves as the antenna. This results in nasty intermittent alternator noise and audio cutouts that are quite annoying to listen to.The audio quality before this happens is quite good. I think the PVC insulation gets brittle in the sun and starts cracking internally, based on my wire & cable dissection.Also, the connector would be much better if it was a right angle plug, rather than a straight 3.5mm male stereo plug."
4,Wow - works great!,"I was amazed how well this worked. Sound is as good as it can probably get through one of these. It's kind of big physically (twice as big as my Sansa Clip) so that was kind of a pain, but excellent sound.The first one I bought had a bad connection inside so the audio cut out. Could not figure out how to get it open, but now that I have a new one (which works perfectly) I'll crack it open one way or another."
2,Wouldn't recomend this,"I received the package a month after ordering it and had absolutely no way to contact the seller. I did finally get there email and then they told me they had not record of the sale. Finally much later I received it and it looked very nice. I pulled it out of the package and threw it my car to give it a test run. As I had just said it looked very nice all blue and glowy but as far as quality goes this is complete garbage. Move the head phone jack and it scratches and shorts ALREADY! Go over a bump in your car or make a turn and the whole thing freaks out and scratches.Overall its a nice looking cheap piece of crap. If you get a nice one that is wired well then you are lucky, because this one is garbage."
2,Worked well...for a while,"Well, seems like this is a common problem with this device. Mine worked flawlessly for about 6 months of almost daily use, and then one day I plugged it in, it lit up blue as it always does, and then turned off...forever. The case smells like burned electronics, so I'm guessing some component inside just gave out. They need to use some higher-quality electronic components in this thing! I know it's relatively inexpensive, but I expected more than a few months of use out of it! In effect, my $20 basically went towards ""renting"" this unit for a few months. Quite disappointed."
4,"Decent Product, Good Purchasing Experience","This product works as advertised, I had no problems in the purchasing/shipping process. The only other thing that I would have wanted is for the product to work as a charger as well."
3,It works fine with some unclear interuption,it works fine but it have some interuption from the radio station i do not know.but it looks fine so far i have it three weeks.
3,Love it - but it broke after 6 months,"It works well, until it breaks! I didn't really use it all that much either. It's pretty cheap though so I will buy another."
5,What an improvement over my Belkin TuneCast II,"I have been using this transmitter for about 2 weeks now. It replaced a Belkin TuneCast II that I been using for a few years. It already outperforms the Belkin in at least two ways:1) Works flawlessly when left in a cold car overnight.2) Remembers the last frequency used when turned off.My cigarette-lighter powered TuneCast II never did either of those things, so the COBY is a real improvement in my book. The one downside is no preset slots like the Belkin offered, but my commute these days in Northern NJ works just fine with just one frequency set.I'd recommend this FM transmitter to anyone looking for one!"
2,review,"I hear too much static in the background while my music is playing, has been like that since day 1."
4,Anniversary Present,love the watch. looks like a bracelet. The background almost looks black- which is what I really wanted
3,I love frolicking in morgues.,"A young girl, Judy Landsdowne (Lilli Palmer) inherits a key that is supposed to help her claim her share of a fortune. Dr. Manetta (Leslie Banks) is intent on getting the fortune himself, but in order to do so he needs seven keys to unlock the chamber. Landsdowne is the last person on his list. She is abducted, but her handsome boyfriend, Dick Martin (Romilly Lunge) gets involved. He sneaks into the mansion, rescues his girl, and stops Manetta's evil scheme.CHAMBER OF HORRORS is an average old-time suspense film. There's a mad doctor who collects torture instruments, a couple of sinister and obedient house servants, a sidekick, and the leading lady's best friend who is only interested in finding herself a man. There has been a crash in recent years to remake classic suspense and horror movies. CHAMBER OF HORRORS is one that is ripe for a remake."
2,Feels Cheap,"The handle feels like it will snap off the pan. The pan itself is functional, but also has a very weak construction. Would recommend spending a bit more and going for All Clad, Calphalon, Kitchen Aid, or other brand, especially if this pan will be a main pan used almost every day."
4,Foreign Policy and understanding,If you're into studying China/Taiwan then this book is a good read in understanding one of the worlds potential political hot-spots which is the Taiwan Strait.
5,"Good Product, Good Price","The quality of manufacture was very good. The heating distribution is very good, so much that you can use a lower setting than you think. It handles the oven (even at high temp)in good fashion. Good looking design, good price, VERY good product."
3,Disappointing,"The straps were not as well finished as one would expect from the usually very nice Wenger line. They are also tapered, which is not the norm for Bund type straps.The pad is quite small-too small for all but one of my 20m/m lug watches.I've done better for less money."
4,so soo soft,"this towel is very soft, i'm 5ft so it covers me very well. it's not fuzzy, didnt fall apart in the washer. i did not use any fabric softner or sheets and it still came out fluffy and soft."
1,Very disappointing,"These towels arrived wonderfully soft, fluffy and colorful. After a year of careful use and washing they have lost all of that. They are quite harsh, colors have gotten splotchy - definitely not worth the price!"
5,excellent response time!,I couldn't find this item anywhere else! thanks for satisfying my curiosity! karen hantsche
4,"Silk Road Journeys, Beyond the Horizon","Candidly, some of thse tracks are an acquired taste. One track in particular, however, ""Distant Green Valley"" is magnificent: equal parts meloncholy, serene, calm and beautiful. The ensemble's musicians - which include Yo Yo Ma - bring a variety of styles to Eastern ""Silk Road"" musical themes. Great with the lights out and a glass of single malt at hand."
5,Completely original feel...,"As a classical album, it is different and quite original. It literally takes you to another place. Maybe because of my origins, I find the album close to me. The songs from Asia, the use of authentic instruments for these well-known songs in their regions are what makes the album beautiful. You really feel like journeying along the silk road, and stopping at locations along the path, and being presented these beautifully orchestrated songs.Regarding my favourites, even though I can honestly say that I enjoyed all these songs very much, I can give the names of the two, Shikasta and Night at Caravanserai."
3,Revisionist Dell: Clear but sanitized 'Pop-History',"Easy to read - but little detail. Nobody builds a business like his without major frights and fights along the way. Dell stresses the direct model & service level. Sadly, my own recent experience fell short of the high standards set. Their website and business model are excellent. The hand of the revisionist & maybe the ghost-writer are evident."
3,OK,"This book was just OK. Nothing special, but not horrible. Michael Dell is a great story, but I was looking for a little more."
3,supply chain management,"I would like to know as brife about supply chain in Dell business and how he can face with obstucles at first period? and Are there only the words of ""cut joint and useless process off"" can work well and his charecteristics to make succuss. could you send me briefly of core of stregy in Dell business? pls send back to me ben"
2,Not as impressed...,"First of all, it is much smaller than I thought that it would be, but that wasn't my issue. It is not as well made as I hoped it would be. The tent is really flimsy and doesn't stay open. It keeps collapsing which is frustrating. I actually purchased this to use for decorations at my son's camping birthday party, and will be returning it because of the small size, but if I had bought it for its intended purpose I would be even more disappointed."
4,Really incredible..,"I'm sixtyone years old..All along my youth I growed up listening like C.Aznavour , Engelbert Humperdinck , Tom Jones ,Shirley Bassey who represent romantic music..In this album I visited those former years while watching him. It is so excited.Charles Aznavour and band are magnificient all together..I advise everybody this DVD who likes him and soft , romatic music."
5,"I LOVE THIS CD - Great, new & fresh dance music...","Not sure what kind of music they are listening to down in PUERTO RICO, but up here in the good old STATES this CD is hot... Obviously Denny Reyes needs to stick to his ""Bolero"".I've tried a few of the Masterbeat titles and they are always consistent with great dance music, and many mixes you don't find anywhere else. This CD is no exception - rare and hard to find mixes like ""Mirage"", ""Chatline"" and ""Would You"" round out the other great staples like ""Call On Me"" (HUGE INTERNATIONAL HIT) and the new mixes of Vernessa Mitchell.The disc is flawlessly mixed and fresh - not the same tracks you find on EVERY compilation out there these days. Way to go Masterbeat! (and stop selling in Puerto Rico! they don't know dance music down there, obviously!)"
3,"Finished playing, uninspired musicianship","Whenever I listen to Karl Leister, I wonder how an instrumentalist with such flawless technical mastery can have so little to say musically. His tone is pleasing, his intonation and technique are accurate -- and his interpretations are uninspired.If you only seek a clear rendition of the music, this recording will suffice. However, if you believe that these works require expressive treatment, look elsewhere."
3,Very helpful for those first choices,"I have read many a homeschooling book and I found this one to be one of the most helpful for choosing my basic educational philosophy. Duffy's ""quiz"" helped me to evaluate my educational beliefs from several different angles and then pointed me toward the approaches that best encompass those.I only gave the book three stars because, as another reviewer pointed out, the word ""Christian"" really should be somewhere in the title, so you at least know what you're getting into. Duffy's religious overtones were quite heavy and that gets irritating after awhile, Christian or not. Can't somebody PLEASE write a helpful homeschooling book that is not heavily Christian!!! (I need to get a few years of homeschooling experience under my belt but if it hasn't happened by then, I may take matters into my own hands.)"
4,kindle edition review,"I've wanted to get this book for a long time. I don't have anything new to add to the other reviews, except for this: don't buy this in the Kindle edition. The charts are very difficult to use because they span two pages (so, since the Kindle shows only one page at a time, you can't tell which product the lines on the second page refer to) and are printed in very faint ""ink"". The charts refer to the page number where you can find the entire review for each product, which is useless when dealing with Kindle ""locations"" rather than actual pages. Very frustrated with this product. May have to buy the print version as well."
3,Too much info,I bought this book so when I went searching for curriculum I wouldn't be so overwhelmed. I'm more overwhelmed now. Plus there really is no discussion on web based schools such as K12 or The Grace Academy.
5,A Must Read for Homeschoolers,I found this book extremely helpful when entering the homeschool arena. Duffy 's assessment of learning styles and teaching styles is right on and definitely helps in narrowing down and directing curriculum choices. Her book also builds confidence for the new homeschooler in making decisions on materials to purchase and rely upon for teaching as the options can be overwhelming! I highly recommend this book especially for those just starting out on the homeschooling journey.
2,Biased,"This should be titled ""Top 100 Picks for Christian and Charlotte Mason Curriculum,"" since the author has clearly outlined her top pick within this book. This guide, while somewhat helpful, primarily is for homeschoolers seeking a curriculum with religion built into it. There are very few non-religious curriculums reviewed in this book."
5,100 Top Picks for Homeschool Curriculum:,This book is very helpful in making curriculum choices. All the choices I made based on Cathy Duffy's book I have been happy with.
3,Romantic Fluff,"For me, the story wasn't interesting enough to sustain me. I, like most, loved the hero and disliked the heroine. They were unmatched in that sense.I enjoyed Jennifer Ashley's writing style and her magnificent hero, but there is something missing from the heroine's characterization.Not bad but not a keeper for me."
4,CLOSET CASE - Hilarious! Rodi's best,"I give it 4 not 5 only because I have to admit that Rodi's books are pretty silly. You have an ad exec firmly in the closet, his flamboyant hairdresser, his conservative, gossipy coworkers, his army dad, his fundamentalist Christian sister, and his downstairs Latina neighbor and her 'gay straight man' boyfriend. Not to mention the guy from Transylvania...I could totally see this being made into a movie. Very much a French farce feel to it (think The Birdcage or The Closet). I just read it again for about the seventh time, and all my friends have borrowed it. A fun read."
2,Unbelievable!,"A gay man is working in an ADVERTISING agency in CHICAGO at the end of the 20th century, and he's afraid to reveal he's gay??? A good-looking SINGLE, 35 year old in a creative field who doesn't date, and his co-workers haven't a clue he's gay? PLEASE! Naive to the point of distraction, and somehow sublty homophobic. I enjoy mindless, funny, gay fiction but this one just bugged me no end. AVOID, please."
5,Best of Shooting star - Solid midwestern rock - all american,"Shooting Star put out some of the best midwestern rock (read all-American rock firmly rooted in the blues) much in the same vein as Kansas in their less symphonic numbers. In fact the inclusion of a violin in most of their songs coupled with their similar regional origins prompted many comparisons to Kansas. But Shooting Star has their own sound and vision and nowhere is it materialized better than in Burning. Lyrically and musically this album is top notch. Highlights are the title track - which they combined with Theme in their live show of the time, to great effect, Winner which is a staight ahead rocker but with prominent violin, giving just so slight a pop/progressive feel, Dreams, and Reckless. They were sort of combination of Kansas and Journey, if you can imagine such a thing. In my opinion, and the opinion of numerous friends that were all into Shooting Star at the time, this is next to their First record as their best."
1,dont buy,this is the dumbest infant toy ever! mine was recd broke! now I have to send it back which is a pain. not worth more than $5
2,Good cure for insomnia,"Netta and Stanley are two losers who bask in their loser-ness. They live buried in despair, boredom, short-sightedness, stupidity - call it what you will - and seem to relish in it. These are two people I wouldn't want to know. The book is a celebration of two people who live in a psychological, mental, social hole and think it a great feat to peer over the edge rather than attempting to climb out. Instead of looking up and beyond the confines of the town they hate, they look down at their shoes and wonder why they keep running into obstacles. The book ends not far from where it began, with a feeling of isolation and endless nothingness. One begins to wonder who ""The Imposter"" really is...."
5,love it,"We bought the blue model, what they call the medium size but it's really heavy duty. We love it. When we squeeze grapefruits, you have to put your left hand on the back of the unit since the pressure to compress the grapefruit will actually tilt the unit forward toward you but with oranges, it's perfect."
5,It's the best,"I love this juicer. It's fast, efficient, fun, and easy to clean. I wish I had discovered it years ago before wasting my money on automatic juicers that never lasted long and didn't juice half as well. I use it for oranges, lemons, limes, and pomegranates. It will not handle large grapefruits."
1,Poor workmanship,"Sadly, I am returning this to Amazon. The squeezing cup in my Juicer is too high, and one cannot change the height as there is a screw machined to fit into a hole on the stand. The result is that it tips over as the maximum force is applied when the lever is almost parallel to the counter. The reason I bought this is that I saw it at my sister's in Australia and it worked great. This is simply not the same product."
1,NOT a ten pack,"In spite of the title and description of the ""package"" they will be shipped in, what you get is one (1) disk in an envelope. Despite the vendor's professed regret at ""Amazon's"" mistake, I see these are still described as a 10-pack a month later, as are many others from this vendor which no doubt are also a single disk in a cheap envelope. American marketing at its finest."
5,5 Connector RCA Cables,I purchased these SO I could connect my DVD player to my new LED LCD HDTV. I could believe the price that I paid for cable of this quality. I was skeptic at first but purchased them anyway. I'm glad I did. They are high quality and well worth the price that I paid. I highly recommend them.
3,Some good features but some downsides,"This is my first burr grinder and overall I find a better more consistent grind than with the blade grinders I have had in the past. The automatic grind time is accurate and a very nice feature. However, the finer the grind, the more fine grounds get spit out from the machine (even with holding the receptacle close to the base unit). The grounds are statically charged and stick to the receptacle and top requiring my brushing the inside and outside in order to get all the grinds. Making a pot of coffee takes longer and between the brushing, wiping the outside of the unit and wiping the counter for the sprayed grinds, cleanup is more of a production. I don't know if this is an issue for all the burr grinders."
2,Not good for French Press- but otherwise okay,"I bought this burr grinder in order to avoid the coffee mud that you get with a French Press. Unfortunatly, I concurr with an earlier review by saying that this grinder gave me a lot more powdery grinds and hence a lot more mud than my old blade grinder did. If you're making drip or espresso it's a great grinder, but I'm having better luck with the Solis Maestro Plus grinder for French Press. I also found that this machine was a little messy: it tended to spit some grinds out of the port."
4,Nuts!,"This grinder is the best thing since the invention of the TV!It's true that it is a little messy and difficult to cleanbut it makes PERFECT espresso grind coffee. It's absolutelysuper. If you love coffee, or more precisely espresso/cappuccino, then you'll love this machine."
4,Works great,"I'm not one to buy something and then write a review the same week. Having said that we've had this item for about 1 year and it has performed admirably. My wife is a traveling RN and I am a recording/performing artist and itinerate worship leader which means we are constantly traveling. In fact we move about every 13 weeks. So, I bought it in Johnson City, TN moved it to Harrisonburg, VA, then Fayetteville, NC and then Alexadria, VA and it has never once given us a bit of trouble. Now we are coffee snobs and use a french press exclusively and this grinder gives us a much better result than our old blade grinder. I would definately recommend this item to anyone who cares about their coffee!"
1,Not for Espresso grind!,"I received this grinder as a gift 2 years ago. At the time, I only used it to grind beans for a drip coffee maker. Since then, I have purchased a nice pump-driven espresso machine. To my dismay, this grinder cannot grind the beans fine enough for a proper espresso. If you aren't picky about how fine you grind your beans and you want a grinder that is easier to use than a blade grinder this is the one for you, otherwise - spend the money for a quality grinder."
2,Terrible Service,"This grinder has been fairly good to me. However, it's very difficult to change courseness settings (espeially from course to fine, since the burrs themselves are moving against residual coffee grounds) amd I would prefer to have numbers on the dial instead of different size dots, since it's easier to remember the number, e.g. for expresso grind, than the exact size of the dot. Also the courseness setting has a tenedency to move itself over time to other settings, due to the machine's vibrations.Now I am trying to get a replacement bin for the bottom, which has been gradually chipping apart form the least 3 years. The distributor, European Gift of Mt. Vernon insists that I order from a list of retailiers, all of whom do not stock the parts. Now back to Square 1.With a...grinder, it seems that one can never expect to buy parts."
1,Am Tired of Waiting for item to arrive,I ordered the juicer from Amazon back in early January for a birthday present and it is now nearing the end of march and just got another delay notice that it wouldn't be shipped until May. This is unacceptable so I cancelled my order. Amazon should not advertise this product if they can't get it to the customer within a reasonable amount of time.
2,Paint problems...,"Mechanically the juicer is great and of a much better design than the other ""geared"" juicers.However, the juicer we ordered was literally painted (not electro-coated) with a blue paint.Particles of blue paint fell from the various joints of the juicer (where metal rubs against metal) directly into the orange juice we were supposed to drink. Not good.We had to return it."
4,Very Fun!!!!,"T3WoTM is a very fun game. If you like Battlefield 1942,it has a very similar feel as that game.The graphics is alittle choppy in the inital playing of each game,but seems to smooth out as you play. This may be to the amount of bots spawning,and how smart the AI is set,that may effect cpu processing. Thus 4 stars instead of 5.You play many roles in the human military base,or you can be several types of terminators including on that can fly.Terminators move very stiffly,and see a red vision,with losts of numbers in the form of square on the left side of the screen. Just like in the first Terminator movie.Futher more,if you have the highest frags,you can select the actual Arnold Terminator.Both Terminators and Humans,have several vechicles and stationary weapons to utilize.The maps are hugh,and finding on-line games is fast,but since this is a new game,I only found 3 or 4 servers. I'am sure as the game becomes more popular,more servers will be available.Enjoy!!!"
5,A beautiful film about disabilities and the arts,"ARTS is a phenomenal documentary about young artists who have various disabilities, but still have the potential and drive to become successful in their medium. Whether their interest lies in drawing, painting, photography, or music, these artists do not let their disabilities stand in the way of their future.It really serves as an inspiration to other aspiring artists, who might be facing certain hardships in their life and just goes to show that you really can do anything that you put your mind to.I also really enjoyed Normal's other films,The Sandwich KidandNormal People Scare Me"
5,Fantastic Quality,"Massively improved my picture quality over AV. Note that the width of the cable for this thing is very thick, and might be unsightly in some places. Really sturdy and well made cable though."
5,Very Pretty Ring,I bought this ring for my daughters 16th Birthday and everyone loved it. My neice loved it so much I am getting her one and my other neice too! I think I seen one in pink CZ also.
1,Terrible quality; will return.,"I was so excited when I first found this highly rated ring on Amazon. I have a lot of good looking CZ jewelry, so I know that it's possible to find a CZ piece that could pass for ""real looking"" jewelry. Most people on Amazon seemed happy with the ring, so I happily bought it.When the ring came in, I immediately noticed the large gaps in between the stones. I posted two pics so you can see what I am referring to. If you look at the ring up close, there is no way you wouldn't see the gaps. Also, the ring is not perfectly round. It looks like it was beaten into a circle with a blunt object, but no one performed a quality inspection to make sure it was acceptable.I wish I would have listened to the 1 star review from Puggaforevet, so I wouldn't have to go through the hassle of returning it now. Definitely a let down."
1,Not good,"Not sterling silver! No .925 stamp engraving is visible inside;Not comfortable! The band edges inside are not smooth;Not attractive! The gaps between each stone, varying in width, ruins effect;Such poor quality, even for CZ.Save your money and shop in person where you can examine the product"
5,cz ring----just as advertised-----!!!!!,"No surprises, wearing it daily now for a month and it looks as good as the first day. Great quality."
3,It's OK,"This book is OK, but lacks depth in many topics to the point where you wish the author never brought them up. I know this is suppose to a quickstart guide, but with some of the explainations it leaves much to be desired.It ios good to get up to speed quickly, but doesn't offer much solid information,."
3,"May not be Jackie's best, but still worth your time.","It may not be Drunken Master II, but it yields some good things. The training scenes and the last fight scenes are descent, but the rest of the fight scenes aren't very good. The story is interesting, but it is definitely plain to see that Lo Wei was just trying to monopolize on the legacy of Bruce Lee( by the way this was the sequel to Fist Fury a.k.a. Chinese Connection if you didn't know). It does tend to move slow, but it is cool when he uses the three section staff. If you are a true Jackie Chan fan, you'll be able to appreciate some good things about it."
2,Aweful sequel to Fist of Fury (Chinese Connection),"This is a bad bad movie, so it's not worth watching. This is Jackie Chan at his worst, well...most of his old movies are really really bad, except for ""Drunken Master"", ""The Young Master"", and ""The Fearless Hyena"". This is suppose to be the sequel to Bruce Lee's ""Fist of Fury"", but ""The New Fist of Fury"" would make Bruce Lee roll over in his grave."
1,bad,jackie chan misses (he rarly does bad im sad to say he did)didnt like it at all. not jackie chan style at all. bad fight scenes
2,Don't use oiley beans,Received this machine and put in some Kona beans. No matter what setting I put it on the grind put out a very fine ground. Wasted on a French coffee press. Called the service line and the tech told me if the beans are oiley this is how they will come out. What good is a machine that cant handle the better grades of coffees. $50. out the window.
3,Great grinder just don't count on it to measure.,We've had this grinder for about 4 months now. We were replacing a Mr.Coffee model that would refuse to grind any beans with a little oil in them so pretty much nothing except basic columbian. This grinder works great at grinding beans and is quick and relatively quite (for a coffee grinder).Only problem we have with it is that does a lousy job measuring. We can set it on 6 cups or 8 and it will almost always grind 10. It just doesn't seem to know when to stop. It worked great for this too at first but after a month or so this problem developed.Also of note is that there are not automatic safety feature on the lid or the base. Not really as great problem as there are no whirling blades but it's possible to start the grinder w/o the cup in place and send coffee all over.
3,"Played the demo, but game is recalled (?)","I finished the demo without any hitches, glitches, hang-ups or lock-ups. When I went to buy the game at GameStop today, the guy told me that the game has officially been recalled. I enjoyed the demo and I would like to buy the game, but not if I can't play it. I don't want to spend twenty bucks on defective software. I honestly don't know what rating to give the game and I do not know if what the guy at the GameStop store told me is true."
5,Best game I have seen since Unreal 2,"Grafic of this game is simply amazing.I have the full version of the game. After playing it extensively I have to say this is one of the best FPSs' in years. I have played the demo and it was a buggy piece of crap. The full version on the other hand is amazing and I love it. The pace, the environment, the combat, the controls, the implants, the arsenal, the inventory, the graphics and sound, it all comes together to make a startlingly great game. I was excited about Halo BEFORE I played this. But trust me guys, Halo has nothing on this game. Yeah I'm sure all you XBox-nuthuggers have something to say about that, well play this game on a great PC and then talk. Its excellent, its expansive, it has GREAT adjustable difficulty (from very easy to very hard and the hard level is HARD, and the easy level is not too bad) and its just a great experience. HIGHLY recommended.Make sure you download a New Patch for this game (English version)"
4,Quiet Baffels,I got the Baffels pretty quick and installed them and they are quiet.The sound is deeper then the orig ones but there is a little ping at the end. I will keep useing them when I want to go quiet but I also like the ones that came with the Short shots.
5,Vampiric Barbie Dolls,"Cute little English Girls transform into Vampiric Barbie Dolls in a world consuming itself with rabid economic competition, disintegrating nation-states and a complete breakdown in ""family values"". The masochistic Ignatz travels surreal circles to protect his nano-tech ""Doll"" from shadowy Yakuzas both corporate and governmental. However, it is the world that needs protecting from the singularity that swirls within her plastic womb.Is this love at first bite or just nothing ever turns out right? Both are true in this psychedelic, sci-fi parable cautioning against so many things that it is clear this world will end, not with a nanotech bang but a post-coital whimper.The writing is a tour de force and the author's fervid imagination is matched by his powers of description that, while intentionally confusing, are never confused. Propulsive. Vivid. Sexy. Disturbed.Don't fall in love."
1,EZ Link failed in middle of first use!!!,"I bought this 4-cycle trimmer and the troy-built edger together. I first hooked up the trimmer and did about 5 minutes of minor maintenance in the front yard, then broke out the edger. I've got a samll 70' lot in Florida with a single sidewalk out front and a short driveway up to the house, that was slightly overgrown with st. augustine's grass. I got 3/4 of the way through edging and suddenly lost power to the edger. I tried the trimmer and it barely had enough torque to rotate the trimmer head--and a couple blades of grass were enough to stop it in its tracks. Disconnecting the ez-link, i discovered that the drive mechanism inside was now coated with shaved metal everywhere--the ez-link connection had been totally stripped and both tools are now a worthless hunk of junk.I previously owned a troy-built trimmer that only lasted 5 trims before the ez-start pulley disintegrated.Now I've got an ez-choice: find another brand."
4,Strong and easy to start,"I have owned this trimmer for about two years now and the only thing that I have bad to say about it is that it is a little heavy. I had a Ryobi before this one and all the tools swapped to the Troy-Built. I have had two problems with the trimmer that I had to repair. The first was with the shaft that goes between the motor and the attachment. I used the trimmer to clear some brush (with a blade installed) and the aluminum coupling stripped out. My fault because I was trying to do too much with it. I swapped the shaft from my old Ryobi (direct replacement) and it worked fine. The second problem was when I tried a first use of the season and it would not start. The fuel line in the tank had broken due to the exposure to the fuel. The gas line was readily available at Lowes and I fixed it in a matter of about ten minutes. After priming it started on the first pull. If it is too heavy for you, get a strap. I have found that it cuts twice as fast as my old two cycle."
3,"Can,t shut it off!","Bought this unit 3+ years ago. Don't use very often- every 2 weeks for 15 minutes or so. Had issues getting the roto-tiller attachment off - connector was bound. Now, kill switch will not shut unit off. Have to pull plug wire off with pliers to kill engine! Tested switch and wires and they all test out good. Unit has plenty of power, runs great , but minor issues make me wish I would have researched more before buying the tiller and edger attachments- now I'm stuck with it."
5,Great apron at a great price!,"I bought this plain white apron for my husband the family chef. It was just what he was looking for. It's not fancy, and is sturdy enough for daily use."
1,a big mistake,i tried this thermal coffee press - delighted to see it was 1/2 the price of other thermal coffee presses - but in this instant you get what you pay for 1) the coffee doesn't stay as hot as a regular thermos 2) when you press the grains down to the bottom they leak back up into the thermos and your last cup of coffee looks and taste like mud 3) its these times that you wish you bought the item in the store because now i have to pack it back in its box and send it back!
4,Helped,The exercises for my neck and shoulders helps relieve some of the stress in my muscles after work. Hoo RA
4,Several different sides of Buck,"The songs on this album sound quite a bit different from the more stylized sound Buck had with the Buckaroos. But it's still great -- usually I don't like Buck without the Buckaroos (it's like Bruce without the E Street Band -- the electricity just isn't there), but here it's different. That's because there is a wide variety, from rockabilly (Hot Dog) to some downright sweet songs (Right After the Dance) and the contagious melodies that are pure Buck Owens (Down on the Corner of Love, to name just one). What helps is the great sound quality. Don't think that because it's early recordings, it's not going to sound good. Someone in some remastering studio treated this with the TLC it deserves. If you like Buck, you will be very happy with this collection."
2,Young Buck...,"I purchased this CD for my son and he was not impressed with it. The sounds were not good and, in general, just not what we expected."
4,Works as advertised,"Works just as you might think it should. The wisk attachment has a speed reducer so it operates at a proper speed and with enough torque to do the job. Warning, if you wisk a stiff mixture in a small bowl be sure to hold on to the bowl or it may spin and through the mixture all over the kitchen (experience talking). Motor will get warm if you run it too long which is also to be expected."
1,Quality is terrible,"I had my Braun hand blender for about 6 months, used it probably 30 times, and it no longer works. The blade will not turn and of course the warranty has expired. Find a different brand."
2,I bought a lemon,"After receiving my handheld blender I didn't use it for some time. I used it twice. Once to chop onions and once to make a milkshake. Then it just stopped working, for no apparent reason. The motor wasn't abused, immersed in water, or dropped. When it did work it did a decent job on the onions but it had trouble with the icecream in the milkshake. The icecream had to be melted or it wouldn't work. It acted like a car stuck on ice, it kept spinning and doing nothing. Even with liquids added it didn't improve. I wasn't able to return it because it has been a year since I purchased it. I am very disappointed because I expected more from a Braun product. Perhaps I was unlucky with the particular unit. Now, do I purchase another one or try another model from another company? There oughta be a lemon law....."
1,Piece of junk,"After exactly 4 month the motor just gave up, the blades are dull. While the concept is pretty smart, the overall performance needs improvement."
2,Broken in box.....Braun's service is ONE Star,"This was a Christmas present and when I took it out of the box the whisk gear box was cracked. After calling Braun I was shocked to find out they wanted $18 for the part. I explained that I thought it should be covered under warranty since it had never been used (I really should cook more) but since this is April and I got it at Christmas time without a receipt.....I am outta luck. I don't complain often, but I think we as consumers deserve better service."
4,Handy gadget,"This is a handy gadget. I recommend it. In the space of 24 hours, I used it to puree a soup in the pot, pulverize some dried porcini mushrooms for a yummy rub (see Bon Appetit) and whip a cake mix into shape. Yes, it is a little awkward with all the pieces, so make sure you have some place to store it. The whisk is a little low-powered, not much better than a hand whisk. The chopper attachment was great for pulverizing the mushrooms and so much easier than getting down my full sized food processor. As others have mentioned, make sure you submerge the blender part completely in your food, or you will splatter your entire house."
2,works best for light mixing,"Was given this mixer as a gift last year. Used it quite frequently for light mixing (shakes,dicing,whipping egg whites) However,when used to mix in thicker ingredients, motor burned out. There was no hint of it going bad. The mixer wasn't made to do heavy mixing but works great otherwise. A lesson learned."
4,"an excellent, versatile and durable appliance","The hand blender is one of the kitchen tools I use most often, and I really love the Braun. It's best feature is the detachable motor, which doesn't force me to interrupt the cooking process to rinse the blender and find somewhere to stand it so it won't fall over. Laugh if you like, but I hadn't realized what a problem this was with non-detachable blenders until I was forced to use one. The multiple speeds are great for minimizing splashing (among other things.) The only criticism I have is for the bowl attachment: it gets clogged really quickly so that the stuff at the bottom of the bowl is pureed while the stuff at the top is left more or less intact."
3,Not bad,"the beater and the blender attachments work well, just the chopper does not work like its supposed to, specially when chopping spinach... I haven't been successfull at all. But still I would say its a good buy from a price to performance perspective."
1,good when it lasts,It was good when it worked. But it only lasted for less than two weeks. The motor died when it was beating cake batter.
4,"Nice appliance, but be careful","I just received this as a gift, and I can't wait to use it, but be careful when attaching/removing the various attachments. I noticed a crack in the motor housing, near where the attachments connect, before I even used the thing! I've already exchanged it, but obviously this part of the blender is a bit weak."
4,Braun Hand Blender,"Handy chopping attachment works well, even though the blade looks flimsy; you don't have to haul out a food processer or mini food processor. Do pay attention to the operating booklet's caution about using an appropriate-sized vessel for hand blending to avoid disastrously messy spattering all over your kitchen. (I did turn to my blender appliance after all, say, for making a smoothie.) Whisk attachment works well, too, though, again it looks flimsy.All parts clean up nicely."
3,Seems to be OK while in working condition,"Well, the blender seemed to be of nice quality, but broke just after first use.I had to return it but a friend of mine loves hers."
2,plastic material does not age well/ withstand boiling hot liquids,"I have used my braun hand held blender for 10 years with satisfaction. It did not come with a bowl or a chopper. It reads Model 4169 Made in Mexico.I blend hot vegetable soups directly in the pot, so it is boiling hot. I noticed cracks appearing in the plastic at the end of the shaft, a few years ago, and my sense is that the plastic is not sturdy enough to withstand durably, boiling hot temperatures. Now some bits of it have broken off. I am going to shop for one but this time I want:1 a metallic shaft2 a longer shaft3 a detachable/ replacable one because the motor of my Braun is fine and could last more years but it is in one piece so I cannot just replace the shaft: A pity!"
1,I didn't get what I asked gor...,"I didn't get what I thought... they send me the hand blander, it has some missed accesories... I didn't have tiem to return it because it was a Christmas gift for my mom.... I'm very disappointed. Is there any way I could get the missed accesories???"
2,Plastic Melted,"I used this machine twice and had to throw it away. It made great coffee, but even on a low flame, the plastic portion melted. If you do buy it, it must be watched VERY carefully."
2,debauchery,this dvd was not in English. and not very. interesting with. no meaning. to It Could not. understand. what. was being. Said. a very. low. budget film
2,Censored,The movie was OK but the tremendous amount of silly censorship really made it almost unwatchable. This was an impulse buy for me and a lesson learned. My impulses are not all that good
1,Bogus product -- not real bagpipes!,"It's a shame Michael Hamilton has made this recording, since he is a genuine piper of true talent. The CD is totally computer generated using some kind of software program Mr. Hamilton created and sells. It is NOT a real bagpipe and Amazon should not be selling it as such. File this product under ""F"" for FRAUD!"
3,Funny!,"If you are a fan of the old Dabney Coleman as I was in his hey-day, this is for you. It is just DC doing his thing and quite entertaining too."
4,Highly underrated 1980s sitcom,"I'd happily give it 5 stars had it included the ""Hit the Road, Jack"" sequence (a squeamish NBC shelved the original broadcast for several months, and I assume the Ray Charles estate charges a lot of money to use the song on a DVD today), but this is a brilliant dark sitcom. Dabney Coleman gives a still-stunning lead performance, and he's surrounded by one of the great ensemble casts in TV history. Much better than the vastly overrated ""Murphy Brown"" and a major influence on ""The Larry Sanders Show."""
3,It's a tarp,Light weight tarp to cover our old 22 foot fifth wheel trailer. The grommets may not be perfect but it works. Probably will only last one or two seasons here in Northern California.
3,I'm feelin' a little bad for giving this recording only 3 stars...,"...after all the glowing reviews, but Burke, who is clearly a monster in terms of his chops, plays so fast that the melodies (which are the soul of Irish fiddle tunes), tend to get clipped under the hooves of his playing. I'm listening to the CD as I write this, and it just doesn't move me like so much Irish music does. It's the speed at the expense of feeling and melody. Listen to Martin Hayes' LIVE IN SEATTLE if you want to hear Irish fiddle that will make you want to cry or get up and dance, depending on the tune."
4,Ultrasof Foam Horseshoes Safe and Fun for Kids,"This set was purchased for my preschool daughter. It is safe to play inside the house or outside on the lawn. I gave this set four stars instead of five stars because the horseshoes need more weight to help children have more control over pitching them. However, it has proven to be a very enjoyable game for my daughter."
3,Bare minimum,"While the book helped me brush up on some basics, practically the entire California history section was a copy-paste from earlier history parts. Speaking only to the Social Sciences section, it did not prepare me at all for the real test. I'd suggest this book as a starting point only."
2,Use at your own risk,"Did Henry Ford actually invent the automobile? Were there actually only 4,000 slaves in the South? Like other reviewers, I've gleaned a lot of very useful information from this test guide, but there are so many errors -- dozens and dozens of them -- that I find myself repeatedly having to seek out other reference sources to verify the facts I am suspicious of. Use this test guide at your own risk."
4,Very Informative Text,"This book is definitley informative with lots of information to know. I haven't taken the CSET yet, but hope to pass by studying from this book and other supplements.I found the book to contain errors that are minor, but then became irritating. The errors sometimes confused me and it got to be very frustrating b/c you weren't sure what was right. Overall, a great book to study from, but have other supplemental books handy as well."
3,The carafe is way too fragile!,"It works well otherwise, but if you are not extremely careful with the carafe or have any children in the household, it's best to get a different coffee maker."
2,Not reliable,"We were delighted at first with this coffee maker. The coffee tasted great- especially with bottled water. The replacement filters have not always been easy to find, and they don't seem to do much anyway. Unfortunately now that we have had the Braun for less than a year, it has konked out completely. For the price, one should expect a little more mileage."
4,Fragile Karafe,"Used this new coffee maker with great anticipation. I was very happy with the results of the brewing and I especially like having a thermostat on the warmer. It keeps the coffee very hot. Unfortunately, after my first use, the karafe broke while drying it with a towel. It seems very, very fragile. Braun customer service was very responsive with a replacement karafe and they wanted the broken one back to measure its thickness."
2,Great coffeemaker that self destructs in 2 years,"I've owned this model twice. Makes excellent coffee, and consistently self destructs, like clockwork in 2.5 years. It costs as much to fix it as it does to buy it new, so I feel like I've bought a disposable coffee maker. Too much money to spend on a disposable coffee maker. It's the electrical system that burns out."
3,Fasion Pet Waterproof Doggy Boots,"Not so much boots as they are slippers.They seem to be made out of a thin plastic nylon and didn't stay bottom-down while my dog walked around so they got worn out pretty quickly; especially outside. Even the ones that fit primarily the way they were supposed to ended up coming apart at the seams around the rubber padding. I ended up wrapping them in electrical tape to repair them which seemed to work okay until I could get new ones that were more durable and fit better.If you do get these, I suggest you keep them for indoor use and get a pair that might just be a little snug on your dog's paw so that the padding stays where it's supposed to be. If you need durability and want to get these anyway, I highly suggest having a way to reinforce them inside and out (there's a smaller pocket inside the larger exterior)once they're delivered if your dog does a lot of walking or you intend to use them for a long time/often."
2,Kinda hard to use,"These boots are hard to put on and the velcro doesn't really secure it too well. I read reviews stating that some buyers should have bought these one size smaller so I did. It's still kind of difficult to put on. Once they're on, our puppy has a hard time getting his balance. He sometimes slides because it doesn't grip well and other times he loses a boot. We have yet to use it out in the rain or snow but if it's already hard to use at home, I'm sure it'll be even trickier outside."
2,Won't Stay On,"These absolutely won't stay on my Rat Terrier. I would have to cut off circulation to her little feet to keep them on, I think. They also don't want to stay in place. They twist and the little ""no slip"" pad ends up on the side or on top instead of the bottom."
3,good music but baby got bored fast,"my 7 mth-old son likes the sunshine face n the music it plays. but it doesnt keep him busy for long. theres nothing much to play with. it has some teether to teeth on but this toy is too heavy for a 6 and half mths old to lift. it makes some different noises too, like squeaking, but somehow he cant really find it yet or he simply not so interested. it also have some lights that sparkle when the music on. but thats about it. wut interesting is, when i attach it to the crib in touch mode, it turns on by itself eventho noone touch it, it probably catches movements. so the most, i just attach them to his stroller or crib juz to hear some music on n hav some light sparkling. its more like a side toy."
2,Neurosmith is out of business. Do you really want their deeply discounted leftovers?,"I was going to write a review chastising myself for having been stupid enough to have overpaid for their Sunshine Symphony. Since then, I see Amazon has dropped the list price to $35, and has discounted it further, down to a sale price of $9.98.I have noticed other Neurosmith products with similarly high product mark-ups, and wish I could be a shareholder of a company that is so adept at exploiting the pocketbooks of new parents. While trying to research some of their other overpriced toys, and those toys' declining price histories, I found the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has recalled a Neurosmith toy (the Pet Me Platypus), and that the manufacturer is no longer in business.So, Amazon is giving you a 71% discount (complete with free shipping!) on a toy that is leftover from a manufacturer who no longer exists. Buyer beware."
5,2 1/2 Month Old FAVORITE!!,"I purchased Sunshine in the hopes I could get a few things done around the house and my little guy loves to be talked to and held all the time. Yesterday I received Sunshine via UPS, opened the box, installed the batteries and WOW...Ryan could not take his eyes off of Sunshine. He smiled, babbled and continued to touch her. This morning, I am writing this review while Sunshine keeps him busy. GREAT TOY!!... In fact, I am placing another order for Sunshine for my niece which is almost four months old.... Sunshine is sure to be a HIT!"
4,Great toy!,"My six month old enjoys this. It can keep him occupied for 10-15 minutes at a time, and the music is quite pleasant and soft. Good toy!"
4,The Best Toy In the World...,"Or so says my baby. ;)She's 2 and a half months old and this is the only toy she will give the time of day, but boy does she love it! She smiles at it the moment she sees it and kicks around to the music.I got it as a gift and thought she wouldn't be old enough for it. I was wrong. She likes it better than she likes most people.The music activity has two settings for different types of play. And there is a low or high volume switch to change as your baby gets accustomed to the sound. The colors are also bright and fun, and each ""ray"" of the sun does something different. I've noticed my girl is partial to the crunchy sounds rather than squeaks.We give this toy 4 thumbs up!"
5,Breath of fresh air,"I bought this toy for our baby daughter a few months back, after reaserching the toy and the company Neurosmith. Our baby at the time was 5 months old. This by far has been her favorite toy!!! She loves it and so do we. The lights enchant her, and the music is wonderful (very soft, not computer generated sounds). Also the different textures and activities are great. The fact that we can strap this toy just about anywhere is also a real plus. The batteries lasted a long time and the quality is top notch. Our baby is now 9 months old and still loves this toy!! A breath of fresh air in all the sme old toys out there."
3,What is Diversity?,"This book really stresses learning about diversity through dialog with others. Some of the examples she uses are a little idealistic and corny, but her main message is important. She points you that as a society we always find someone to stigmatize and stereotype. The way to get over these hurdles is to talk openly and learn from each other. Only then can diverse people feel truly comfortable with each other."
3,Works as expected,"Installation: 4 starsPicture Quality: 2 starsInstallation was straight forward. The only thing I needed to do was download fresh drivers from the manufacturer's website. The accompanying CD had 6 month old software. Besides installation and detection was a breeze.Picture quality is the most important part of a capture card. I have this card connected to Comcast Expanded basic. I'm using the tuner to tune and record shows with a third party tool called Beyond TV (also sold on Amazon). Every channel comes in very soft and on some channels there are very slight halos. I've read online that there might be some registry hacks to correct this issue, but I have yet to apply them and am reviewing this card as what I got in the mail, not something that I have to tweaked to perfection. For comparison the other capture card in the system is a Hauppauge WinTV-FM. The picture quality is sharper, but it lacks a MPEG encoder so it consumes a hardy portion of CPU time when recording."
3,Executive Time Management - A Postgraduate Course,"This is not for the novice who wants to learn the funcdamentals of time management. Although the fundamentals are discussed they are late in the program, they are not given sufficient discussion, and are assumed to be already in use.This stresses the selection of tasks consistent with one's goals and focuses on task selection more than the fundamentals.If you are looking for fundamentals, I do not recommend this. If you are an experienced time manager who is looking toward refinements, this may be of benefit."
2,Come to The Throne,I didnt know what to expect but this album was not very upbeat and I thought it was kinda boring. I was mislead by the album cover.
4,"Good Pictures, Useful Calendar and Interesting Articles.","BLUE RIDGE COUNTRY covers the mountain regions of Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, Maryland, South Carolina and Kentucky. The best features of the magazine are the pictures and the calendar of events listed chronologically for each state. The rest of the publication contains some interesting articles and of course a lot of advertisements."
2,Awkward tone,"This movie would be so much better if it had some background music playing during some of the scenes in the first 3/4 of the movie. It's almost too quiet, especially when the kids are plotting, and that makes the tone feel kinda dark and scary when it should be more of an engaging adventure. The editing is also slow and with the way the dialoge is cut it feels unnecessarily drawn out. Also, after the gang solves the mystery, the movie takes a strange turn into some sad domestic issues. A little too heavy for my kids. I rented this movie for my boys, 7 and 5, because the dvd got good reviews, so we were disappointed that it wasn't that interesting. The 5 year old lost interest after 10 minutes, and the 7 year old wasn't impressed and checked out after about 40 minutes. We won't be renting the sequels."
5,Another Great Book in a fantastic series,"I enjoyed the previous two books in the Wallflower series, but this one was fantastic -- Nothing like a flawed hero to make a girl's heart flutter. The unlikely matchup of wallflower Evie Jenner and the scandalous rake Viscount St. This book is filled with fireworks, tender moments, life-and-death scenes, and all the right elements to make one fantastic book. Rosalyn Landor is my most favourite reader and she does not dissapoint with this narration!"
1,DONT EVEN BOTHER!!!!,"To me, dont even bother starting reading this book. It is so boring from the beginning that is ridiculous!!!! I wish I wouldnt spent my money on it...."
4,"Notorious Rake? YES, Pleeeeeeez!","So far, this is my favorite of the Wallflower series. I liked both of the main characters very much, and enjoyed watching them develop. I know that it's unlikely a notorious rake like Lord St. Vincent could fall madly in love with a shy, stammering girl like Evie (especially so quickly), but you can always hope.Most of my enjoyment came from St. Vincent's character. I don't know what it is about bad boys. In real life, I do my best to stay as far away from them as possible, but I know I would be doomed if I ever came across someone like Lord St. Vincent. You can only resist raw passion and intense animal-magnetism for only so long.The Devil in Winter is a satisfying read and I highly recommend it."
3,Mediocre,"After seeing how highly this book was rated by other readers, I expected a bit more than I got. The story was sweet, and I did like the main character, Evie, and Sebastian as well, but the story was slow and often lost my interest. I am an avid reader and when I get into a book, usually cannot put it down for anything, but I found that I could not get into this story and would get distracted by other things, which, when the book is good, is unheard of for me. And the ending was too drawn out - I could have done without the last 10% of the book. I do not have any great criticisms of the story other than I found it boring. that is all i have to say."
5,Good Read,"I love anything written by Lisa Kleypas and this book is no exception. I really like it when writers do a series of books. I found all of the other ""Wallflower"" books at used book stores, but not this one. So I was glad when I found it on Amazon.com. It arrived in excellent condition and also in a timely manner. I would diffently order for this seller again."
5,Devil in Winter,"I loved this book, as I have loved all Lisa Klepas' books so far.Her characters are so loving and warm and fascinating, although theydon't start out that way. That's the fun of seeing them emerge intowonderful people. One would never think that Sebastian would turn outso different by the end of the book. Evie also emerged into a lovelyand interesting woman. I love the way Ms. Klepas includes the previousbook characters, Evie's friends, Lillian, Annabelle and Daisy. I can'twait to read Daisy's story next. I have read these books backwards,as I started with the Hathaways and got so interested I had to readthe previous series that led to that series."
2,A bit boring for me... Not as good as her first two books,"Was it just me or am I the only one who found it boring? I am more than half way through and am trying to force myself to finish. It's not as fun, and light-hearted as the first two in her series. I loved the first two, and I loved the strong and fun heroines. I found Evie to be so morose, unemotional, unexciting, and a drag. I don't see what St. Vincent sees in her at all. If I were him, I'd go after someone else. The book seems so serious. I don't want to read about her abuse in a romance novel. It's depressing. The only funny part was when they were getting married at Gretna Green. That was cute. But other than that... I did skip a bit to the end and I think it picks up a little there. I hope so. So far, I don't like it very much, and I usually love Lisa Kleypas' work, especially her two Wallflower books. They were fun reads."
2,Disappointing Vacu Vins,These wine jackets work for only a short period of time. You must replace them frequently to keep a bottle of wine cool...or...drink quickly.
2,Like a Textbook-- published by PRC,"The author presented quite a rosy picture on China. On privatization, this book praised the successful gradual approach of the government. On institutional reform and liberalization, the market forces and foreign investors seem to be transforming China into a ""rational"" and democratic system.Although the author distances himself from the neoliberals on the issue about privatization, his logic on institutional transition and modernization nevertheless make him more of a neoliberal than otherwise. This book described the policy reforms and changes of social control mechanism nicely, but not the social problems and challenges resulted from the reform.Optimism is fine, but downplaying the uncertainties and social ills associated with globalization is not. The excessive optimism of the book make it like an English version of a Chinese official textbook."
2,BORRRRRRING!,"I seldom don't finish a book I start, but this book was an exception. Three quarters of the way through, I realized that I didn't care how it came out, who did it or about any of the characters in it.This book reads like a detailed list of someone's day, with all the minutia intact. Pages and pages go by with nothing happening that contributes to the plots of the story. The characters are one dimensional and talk in dialogue that reminds you of a bad B-grade movie from the 1930s.Ms. Fairstein is obviously taken with the higher society of New York City but she comes across as a snob in this book, yammering on about the ballet, opera, trendy restaurants, etc.This is the second book by her that I have read, but there won't be a third."
2,A disappointment,"It arrived with a hairline crack, which I stupidly ignored. I never soaked it or left it wet or unwashed, took good care of it, and now the crack is a chasm. oh well....."
1,Made in China junk,"Rosle is known to make quality German-made items. This was made in China, and do I feel ripped off! No more Rosle for me!"
4,"Bella, bella","I have had my La Pavoni for more than five years. Other reviewers describe my experience accurately: after you get the hang of the correct grind, tamp, and amount of pressure when pulling a shot, you get great espresso. I enjoy the trial and error, because with a decent burr grinder and fine espresso it wasn't that difficult to figure out and even early shots were better than the espresso available in my city five years ago (since then, Denver has upped the ante). I love my La Pavoni and bought it after reading about them in a Mark Bittman cookbook. Occasionally (like after five years) they need a little maintenance, and it is not a big deal. . .but it requires a little searching to find someone to service your La Pavoni depending on where you live."
2,"Author, pu-leeeeeze!","I understand this is historical FICTION, but basing a plot on Elizabeth I's interest in making Britain first in healthcare is preposterous. One would hope that this author's next book in the series is more fiction and less fantasy!"
1,Very poor quality,"I ordered a replacement to determine if the poor quality of the first block was an individual issue rather than an issue with others. Both blocks had quality issues. The knife slots pictured on the box did not represent the sizes and placement of the slots on both blocks, which can be an issue with longer knives. The slots on the second block were significantly crooked. Will return this as well. Wusthoff and/or Amazon should improve quality control."
5,Great and Simple Product for a starter in Culinary Field,"I think this product is a great and useful tool in the kitchen. For me it was a great start to my kitchen and it holds all of my wonderful Wustof tools/knives. I think anyone would see that this product is great and the price was very reasonable for it's duties, especially after looking for one in the stores. They were twice as much and I couldn't find the right kind for my set of knives. Great Product!"
4,rosle bowl,I regret that I didn't buy elsewhere only because the bowl had a rough edge and counter [?] scratchs. It didn't meet my expectation of a new bowl.
1,Help: Could someone tell me how to use it?,"I guess i'm just dump. I bought this cool stuff after I read the review. However, I could not figure out how to use it?I appreciate it if anybody who knows it could post a guidance for me.I just received the one-piece pitcher without manufacturer's information. thx a million."
3,"bored, bored, bored",This book was completely outclassed by Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR Wired. Don't read anything else; it's a waste of time.
3,a ok memory card,i got this memory card at the same time i got my dreamcast. i have lost sonic saved games. i plan to get a sega VMU soon
1,Not Worth It,At the time I needed a memory card this was the only one around and for the time it has served fine now with newer games like Sega Rally 2 its a complete flop it might save 1 out of every 40 trys and load 1 out of every 100 tries literally its horrbile I would recommend trying to find a sega brand VMU as they have no flaws with games.
2,Memory Card is piece of c*ap,"I have a Sega Dreamcast and I have the same memory card as everybody else and in my personal experience the thing always corrupets when I create player's,and I'm really tired of saving things.So I'm going to buy a VMU as well, tomorrow.Those reviews really helped alot.Thanks!"
1,Useless Junk,I agree 100% with the previous review stating that this product is a piece of junk. I purchased two of these memory cards and both corrupted all data 1/3 times it was used. Returned both and purchased a sega VMU. I haven't had a problem since.
4,A great fun read,"Going Corporate is a fun book that could help a newbie to the world of office life navigate with a little more ease. I'd love to read a review from a person who reads this book while still in college and then reflects on it 1 year later.I think that most readers are likely to already be in the ""real world"" and are amused by the authors' take on day to day life.Some highlights:- why the company wants you to drink coffee.- the politics of bag lunches versus buying lunch.- eating at your desk.- the IT department.- being ""yourself.""I don't think that reading this book helped me at all, but it was entertaining at the very least."
2,Wasn't as helpful,"as other books that my parents bought me...there was no real meat or insight in it, just kind of a flippant read and contains things you figure out at least 2 weeks into your job. Funny, but no real help."
2,HUGE,"We received these as a gift. While the plates are beautiful and match the kitchen decor, they're just TOO BIG!Only 4 dinner plates fit in the dishwasher. And I'm good at packing it. We've had several sets of pfaltzgraph before, and have other china, etc, I've never seen this problem; I can usually get 10 dinner dishes in. These would be unusuable for any large gathering; I won't wash by hand...The bowls are way too huge, like mixing bowls. 2 of these bowls stacked take up the space of 6 of our older pfaltzgraph dishes. The cups are larger than our old bowls, and much better than the old cups.This seems to be a new fashion, like the restarants that serve you gigantic portions of food you don't need. I'm afraid my kids will either overeat or waste food by taking too much.Even though they're beautiful, they're being returned."
1,Incompetent,"The reviewers who say this book is more romance novel than ""chick lit"" are correct. However, though I'm not in the habit of reading romance novels, I wouldn't have minded that aspect of this book if it had been well-written in any way. Obviously, it isn't. It's dull and shockingly unfocused. The contrived dialogue strains to hit all the necessary plot points and sounds totally unnatural. And why so many characters? Does the author really expect us to care about them all? I couldn't even bring myself to care about the main character--I hated her almost immediately.I was initially excited to read this book because it takes place in Australia--a welcome change of pace from the New York setting of most chick lit. Too bad the book was so terrible. It needed a serious editor to cut down the length and smooth out the writing. Too bad Red Dress Ink doesn't seem to employ any competent editors--and incompetent writer plus incompetent editor equals completely lousy book."
4,"Well written, but...","Great book in giving the insights of professional sports during the Russell-Chamberlain era. But, on page 110, a reference was made that Russell was not able to stay at the same hotel as the white players in Dallas and therefore he immediately caught a plane home. However, Russell did play in the exhibition game that night as I was in attendance and watched him."
4,"Good, But soon worthless.",I own a lug-Nut and they're hard to find their good cards.level 5 bolt-man cards are what they usually have. BUT WAIT! there are even more lobjaw cards.
5,Good job,This should be included with the juicer as the other 'Postee' stated.Its a good bit of kit.
2,Surprisingly cheap from such a well known name,"The slots for you blades are various sizes, however I can only fit one 8""+ chefs knife at a time, they all seem relatively small. The material is good quality, the handle seems solid, ample storage for other utensils. The velcro that holds the roll shut has come unstitched twice on both sides. I have used double sided tape and resewn both pieces now and I have only had this bag since Christmas."
2,Unexpected from a company like Wusthof,"Does not come with a strap, altho that was known before purchasing. What was not known, however, was that the stitching on the piece of nylon that holds the strap D-ring in place would come undone after a whopping two very mild uses. Not into the idea of refurbishing or repairing an item that's got all of 2 hours of use on it.Knives are great... this particular roll, not so much."
3,Northern California Atlas & Gazetteer,"Great resource for the camper and hiker. A little heavy to carry as topo maps; however, just as effective. Elevation in metric is a negative."
4,Future Sight,"There are a few good decks in this set of 4. I personally like the suspended sentence deck the best. The Rebels Unite deck is pretty good, although could benefit from some tweaking to make it better. Overall I was happy for this purchase for the price I picked it up for."
1,Subpar Product,"This product is of extremely poor quality. One of the spice canisters broke the first time I tried to put spices in it. The carousel does not revolve smoothly and spices leak out of the canisters onto my counter. The plastic is very cheap and flimsy and the windows pop out constantly. If I could return this product, I would, but my return window expired before I opened and used the carousels."
3,great item!,it was a great item but when I took it out of the box it had some parts I had to glue back together.
4,Great item for spice storage!,"I had been watching online for this product but at a reduced price. I finally found it here at Amazon,not only free shipping but buy 3, get one free deal. Unfortunately a few containers need to be glued, but fortunately I have 'back-ups' with this extra rack. It's so nice to have cleaned up the clutter in my cabinet with all types of spices."
1,Not Worth It,"The functional design and concept attracted me but the end product is cheaply made. My favorite was that the instructions state very clearly, ATTACH THE HANDLE BEFORE REMOVING FROM BOX. Unfortunately, they put the instructions at the bottom of the box tightly packed box. Without the handle in place the containers are not fitted tightly and as soon as I removed it from the box half of them fell out and broke. Awesome."
2,Tired of buying replacement bracket,I love the idea of having it under the counter. It spins nicely but the downfall is the bracket that holds the rack under the counter is made of plastic with little tabs that break easily. So far I have had to replace it 5 times at a cost of $2.50 per bracket. Pour design. Perhaps that mounting bracket should be made of something more durable then hard plastic.
3,Broke coming out of the box,"I opened the box to find instructions stating to attach the handle before removing the spice rack from the box...so I did. Upon pulling the carousel out of the box by the newly attached handle, the little plastic tabs holding the handle in place, snapped off. I don't want to return the item. Just want the handle replaced."
5,"Well made, easy to install.","We recently adopted a larger cat and needed to enlarge the door for the litter box access. This cat door was large enough for our new cat but doesn't appear to be cumbersome to the normal size cats. I needed to enlarge the door opening, and with the included template and clear instructions this was easy using a drill and a electric jig saw. Our door was hollow and this posed no problem as the door doesn't screw to the thin wood door, rather one half screws to the other half and sandwiches the door in between. I believe this is a better approach for a hollow door and is still fine for a solid door. The door is well made and looks good installed."
3,Holiday Triple Feature,This is very good video for this time of year to lend out to help keep kids or grandparents get in the mood.
4,Great for the season,Love Christmas stories and as technologies change this is a good movie to hav available to watch several times on our schedule.
4,Using it on pistol sights,"I have a couple of tiny set screws holding down a rear sight on a 9 mm. I seem to have a tiny bit of drift on this sight, but it may be because I need another application.There is no question thought, that this stuff works because without it the screws loosen within 5-10 rounds. Now I can go for more than 100 rds with no apparent loosening."
3,"A little quick, a little chatty","This was my first experience with Denise. I was fully prepared for her chatty and frilly encouragement, but I still found it hard to finish any of these segments without becoming too annoyed. I do think the idea of this workout DVD is great! And the exercises really do ""hit the spot"". I would recommend this video for someone more familiar with traditional pilates, as Denise runs through the movements pretty quickly with little focus on form or breathing. I didn't really get much of a workout with this video, but it definitely would be beneficial for a pilates novice to move up to and advance their skills and workout."
5,Hit the Spot Pilates is fun!,"I don't like to exercise very much, but this video is nice because the workouts are fun movements and Denise doesn't count, which, for me, makes the workout go faster."
2,Not Challenging enough,"I have always been a big fan of Denise's and generally enjoy her workouts. This one however, felt like a waste of time for me. I am in pretty good shape, and it just didnt challenge me."
1,Worst Dvd ever!,"She is way annoying. If you havn't worked out in yrs. this may be the workout for you. This is not challenging at all, and a waste of my money."
2,Great for beginners a dissapointment for interm-adv.,"i was really excited about this video, but when i put it on i was extremely dissapointed. i come with a decent amount of pilates background and this focused nothing on technique and was so beginner i dont think i got any workout. the hips workout was a good burner though, but after doing this once i will probably never do this video again. she's way to peppy for me and i was looking for a much more serious pilates workout that would garner fast results."
2,Too fast,"I have always like Denise Austin, however; this was tape was way too fast for a beginner. I thought it was for beginner and on up. Denise went way to fast and she did not explain the poses at all. I will not be using this tape. I was disappointed because normally I love her videotapes and her."
3,"DVD number 4,583?","Denise Austin is a machine; her industry is putting out DVD's on every conceivable aspect of fitness. I might be in the minority here, but I would prefer a much simpler approach: give us her show's by the year number. A year would cover all aspects of ALL approaches plus the spunky, friendly, inspiring, sexy, homy, Denise that some of us (secretly) love."
5,Butt-Kicking Fun,I really like this game because you get to do all the fun stunts Jackie does and get to kick some bad-guy butt along the way. The game is great for some quick fun and entertainment. It is just hard enough to keep me interested but yet not so hard that I get bored with it and give up. Great for when you need 15 minutes of fun. You can actually get through a level and save your game within 15 or 20 minutes which is perfect for those of us on luch break at work looking for a little down time. It is reminiscent of Double Dragon for Nintendo with some Jackie Chan antics thrown in. I highly recommend it. It is great fun. Well worth the price.
4,This puppy does the job,"Noisy, yes, but that's ice it's crushing. My wife loves crushed ice. We've gone through a lot of manual and electric ice crushers over the years. This baby crushes the ice and it does it time after time. Ours has lasted 3 years. I'm buying another for my daughter and her kids for this summer. Glad Amazon had the product."
5,Educational,I bought this and other items like it as gifts for my grandsons. They have gotten many hours of activities with them.
3,"Interesting, but less than expected.","I had hoped to see some of the intricate detail of the illustrations in the Book of Kells that I could study by coloring. Instead, the elaborate drawings are reduced in size to fit the book pages, and the fine details of interlocking lines and artwork are lost."
5,Perfect!,"Its fantastic, there are color pictures on the inside cover so you know what the actual art looked like. The coloring pages are nice and the selection of items to color is broad."
5,A Chip Off the Old Block,"As a dedicated reader of Skeeter Skelton for many years, I have to say that son Bart writes with the same level of enthusiasm, wit, and knowledge of firearms and desert lore as did his father. I am sure Skeeter's grin is a mile wide as he and sidekick Bill Jordan observe from Heaven how popular an author Bart has become."
5,a wonderfull overview about the artwork of frank kozik,"if have bought this book a few month ago. i found a lot of the old style posters from the ""salad days"". the book is a great summary of the interesting style of kozik. everytime when i take a look on it, i found some new details."
1,Dreadful............,This is jibberish and rehashed rhythms from start till end! unbelieveable that there are 7 versions of this song! Stay away from it!
2,"check out G0490 8"" Jointer with Parallelogram Beds before you buy this.","I have used this jointer for a while and wasn't impressed until I had the opportunity to work on G0490 8"" Jointer with Parallelogram Beds ... Awesome machine , costing under $900 including delivery.I went ahead and purchased for myself and loved all the features and it was dead right , on first cut.I am not sure how Grizzley can deliver better machine with better build quality for $300 cheaper than Powermatic, but I would always check out Grizzley before buying powermatic."
5,Annie's grave is a great album!,"This record kicks. Best songs are 'Annie's grave', just can't kick, and already dead. Electric vocals, undead punk rock sound. A record that you dont have to hit fast forward once. Check it out if you like bands like agent orange, circle jerks, sloppy seconds, dead lazlos place, Ill repute, damnation, offsprings first 2 records, etc."
5,Fun game,"Our son, who is almost 8 is a big Spider-Man and Spider-Man game fan. He has a Wii, a DS Lite, and a PlayStation 2 and although this is a PlayStation 1 game he still wanted this game after seeing it on youtube...he asked for it and talked about it for weeks before we decided to get it for him as a surprise. He loves playing this game."
3,"Part Two,True Believers!!!","Here it is:part two to the previous game.Sadly,the game isn`t as good as the first one.But there are new goodies to collect,and new options to choose.Such as ""Create a Spider"".In this option,you choose powers and costumes to make the ultimate spidey character!This game is twice as challenging then the first.Also the enemies and bosses were nicely animated.Enemies such as:Electro,Shocker,The Lizard,and more!Overall:Awesome game.Life is a great big bang up,where ever there`s a hang-up:You`ll find the SPIDER-MAN!!!"
4,Not as good as the Original.,"I said in my Spider-Man review for Playstation one that it's better then the one based on the movie.This game is mutch more SHORTER,less VILLIANS,no BLACK CAT,no MARY JANE PARKER,mutch EASIER,I like HARD GAMES NOT EASY!But still good it has two of my favirotes The Lizard and The Shocker I wish they had Hydro-Man instead of Hammerhead so Hydro-Man and Sandman can fight and turn into The Mud Monster!That would be a REAL challenge instead of Hammerhead.He's too easy!"
1,Spider Man 2: Enter Electro,"I purchased this game and liked it at first .Until I found out my 7 year old brother beat the game in only 2 days.Whatever you do don't buy this game.The first one was much,much better."
2,Look elsewhere,"Been using both the salt and pepper mills for over 6 months. Much like all the other related negative reviews, problems maintaining a decent grind without constantly adjusting the screw. Gets real old, real fast. Additionally, pepper mill is very particular about the peppercorns. Hard and larger (relatively speaking) peppercorns do not grind consistently, if at all. Currently looking to replace both mills and will not buy another Peugeot based on my experience."
5,Pop Stars!,"Oriana Orange Creme with Holly Honey Husky is so cute!She is one of our daughters favorites from the Soda Pop Girls Collection.They dolls and their pets are lighly scented, not at all overpowering.Our five year old daughter refers to as them as her 'mmm smells delicious dolls'.No wonder she wants a snack when she plays with these dolls!She loves playing with all her Soda Pop dolls. She thinks the matching flavored lip gloss is the greatest!Since she has to kiss you after she puts it on, I think the lip gloss is pretty terrific too!Her seven year old brother, on the other hand, does not!His comment, 'yuck'!"
5,Thank you Amazon for carrying this item!,"You're supposed to replace these filters every two months - I couldn't find them in a store anywhere and tried ordering them online directly from the manufacturer, but I guess my order was lost somewhere in cyberspace. Amazon to the rescue! I have finally replaced my coffee maker water filter after 2 years, and that's a good thing."
1,extreme disappointment,"I received the wrong item from the seller, Seneca River Trading. It was their mistake. I have sent 3 emails (the only method of contact provided by the seller)and have yet to receive a response or resolution. I am extremely disappointed with this seller!! Regardless of the cost of the item/s purchased, the seller/Amazon should be concerned with customer satisfaction. They obviously are NOT."
3,Filter water through gold?,"The product is difficult to find, except online, and ridiculously expensive, but it does improve the taste of the coffee. I suggest ordering more than one to save on the shipping even if it means paying throught the nose twice!"
5,fender,bought this for a customer.... he cut it to his liking but other than that i was a nice piece.. (i have UFO plastics on my CR500 and like them A LOT)
1,Why not a kindle edition?,"Having this read this series several years ago, I have brought the first two volumes for my kindle, imagine my surprise when the third volume isn't available as a kindle edition.....disappointing at the least."
5,A compelling first hand look at life aborad a WWII sub,"Overdue and Presumed Lost is a moving account of the patrols of the USS Bullhead. The author who was aboard the submarine's first patrole captures the drama as well as humor of life on a submarine on active patrol. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the ""silent service"" of our Armed Forces. The author's style of writing makes this a quick read yet also a moving account."
5,Buzzy Linhart Classic recordings,"I had the thrill of seeing Buzzy only once at The Schaefer Festival in Central Park probably in 1972 or 1973. As an old folkie who had gigged around the coffee houses in Greenwich Village, I had heard a lot about Buzzy but was unprepared for just how powerful a performer he was. This compilation has all the great Buzzy Linhart songs brilliantly performed. Check out how wonderful & unique the bass playing is throughout, even though the players change. And Buzzy's singing is simply stunning! Nobody sang like Buzzy & he still remains like no one else. Back in those days (like today) rock & pop singers didn't or maybe couldn't ""scat"" sing. Buzzy was a scatting son of a gun. People in the music industry & in the know loved Buzzy, but he never was well known. He deserves a resurgence & a cult following, if not more. Most of the stuff on this album, BTW, is produced by none other than Eddie Kramer of Jimi Hendrix fame."
5,everyone needs one,"Everyone needs a cast iron skillet. This one is as good as any other, and it's priced perfectly! It's the right size and it has the extra handle to help pick up since it's so heavy. there's no reason to pick any other one (unless it's even cheaper which I cant imagine)."
1,Not fit for my stove,"Cast iron ware is incompatible with my glass top range; therefore, I had to give one away and return the other.This should be more pronounced in the write up."
5,Cast Iron Cookware,"Though very heavy still the best in cookware....new cookware is fine but does not and will not ever outlast the good old cast iron. If you take of it. Even with the newer ""finishes"" cast iron should be a part of any kitchen and anyone that actually cooks these days...."
2,Joe Bostic???,"This book only contained a brief summary about the life of Joe Bostic. There were a lot of pictures, information about the author and information about announcing. My son was able to complete his report, but needed another source."
2,Time extractor,"As with all Bruan appliances this unit is attractive, nicely designed (and no doubt higher in quality than the Popeil/Ronco TV stuff). The catch is, you drink the juice in a few seconds but spend 15 minutes scrubbing the various parts. A monumental hassle, frankly."
2,Mediocre juicer,"Juicer does not extract as much juice as you would like to get. Leaves very moist pulp, even with fruits/vegetables that hold more water (tomatoes, citrus fruit).Carrots came through the machine and did not separate/extract enough of the juices from the pulp. Wasting a lot of produce.Cleaning is not very easy as there are many nooks and crevices that pulp likes to hide. Must be cleaned in between multiple juicing tasks as the machine plugs up quickly and pulp ends up in your juice.Unless you're willing spend a lot of time cutting produce up before juicing, I would like for a higher wattage juicer."
2,MASTERPIECE!?!?!?!???,MORE LIKE A FINGERPAINTING!! A really bland one done by a child who has recently begun pueberty and become akward. Understand is a hell of a song though.
1,Not what they used to be.,"My first pair of Continental Town & Countrys, made in ""Western Germany"", lasted 12 years. I replaced them with the same model, but made in Taiwan. They didn't last 2 years, and I had many more flats from sharp objects before the sidewall gave out. I understand now the tires are made in India and are all black (woohoo!) but I'm not willing to take the chance. I don't imagine they improved the quality by moving the manufacture to India."
2,tons of flats,I have had more flats with these tires than with any other tires I have used. I am going back to Schwalbes.
5,"easy as 1,2,3. Shaun palmer 5 *stars","If you played coolboarders,or ssx,shaun palmer is like coolboarders but not any thing as fake as ssx.Five stars is my grade!I know i got it 4 christmas!"
4,Oval Crock Traveler,You say in the rival 6 quart oval slow cooker that the insulated carrier is important. But the BIG round one does not appear to fit the oval and the oval carrier says it only holds up to 5 1/2 quart. Help before I buy one of these for my 6 quart oval
2,Problem with CPU consumption,"I have been using Tiny Firewall before switching to ZoneAlarm about 18 months ago. While the daily use is quite simple, I missed some of the features of Tiny.However, the reason why I had to remove ZoneAlarm appeared about 2 months ago: when left alone over night, the CPU consumption of a process installed by ZoneAlarm called ""vsmon"" goes up to 100% (we are talking about a 2.4GHz system), blocking the usability (it is not a virus / trojan). The problem is experienced by several people on the web without a known fix from ZoneLabs at this point.Several people on the web also mentioned privacy / spyware concerns with ZoneAlarm. This I could not verify."
1,good unless you network,"This is great for a standalone PC or laptop.If you network, it may cause big problems even when disabled or not running. It happened to me, it's documented on Google once you get deeply entangled in TCIP etc etc, basically make sure you completely uninstall it before networking in any way at all... it makes registry changes that it only corrects on uninstalling that prevent any networking no matter how you configure or completely disable it. Uninstall is the only solution.Wish I'd known that before wasting a whole day trying to fix problems it caused."
5,best ever experience with personal firewalls,"ZoneAlarm Pro 4 is pretty good one if you are looking for a reliable firewall and at the same time you don't want to get into details of fine tuning and configurating them. I used the free version of ZA before the release of ZA Pro 4, and it was an ok one, but when ZA 4 was released i decided to give it a try. I purchased the online downloadable version of it and it's already 5 months i'm happily using it. It's very simple to use and I am thinking to renew my license one more year when this one expires. It pays off the money you give for it. I highly recommend it."
1,Poor grade plastic,"Got the phone cover, fit an worked great for the first day. Then it just started getting more and more cracked in my pocket. Basically was crumbled by about day 4."
3,Looks good... until it gets all scratched up!,"This case fits well on the N95 while giving you access to all of the phone's features, and looks good doing it. However, like other reviewers have said, the grade of plastic they use to manufacture this is poor.First, it scratches way too easily. The case looks great when it is new, but after a few weeks of use, the front has chicken scratches all over it which makes it hard to see in the sun. Second, it is too brittle. I have never dropped my phone and usually put the phone in my inside pocket or occasionally in pant pockets, but somehow it has manage to develop cracks on the corners.If they made this case with a better grade plastic that was more resistant to scratching and more durable, I would easily give it 5 stars."
2,Quite disappoiting,On the very same day I've started to use the case it showed some cracks and as I've read before it does not slide to one of the sides. I would recommend something else...
3,"snaps on and covers n95 pretty nice; not so rugged material, a side cracked just after one low fall","snaps on and covers n95 pretty nice; not so rugged material, a side cracked just after one low fall"
4,I liked this book.,"At last! I have found kindred spirits. I got this book years ago and loved it, but almost no one else I talked to did. I was beginning to think I was crazy, but other people on this site like the book, too. I think that people who are unwilling to explore themselves or tough topics will not get much out of the book. People who are willing to be honest with themselves and explore tough topics will get more out of the book.Having said that, I think it would have helped if the questions were more open-ended, as opposed to yes-or-no. For example, the question, ""Would you like to know the precise date of your death?"" should have included ""Why or why not?"" Also, the question ""Would you prefer to be blind or deaf"" should have been worded as ""Which is worse - to be blind or deaf?"" The former causes most people to say ""Neither!""By and large, this book is what you make of it."
4,Convo Starter,Great way to get a stimulated conversation going in a group of people. Most of the questions are good with a few exceptions. I select some questions to start classroom discussions on particular topics and it works great.
4,Gets everyone involved and thinking,"We bought our first ""Book of Questions"" years ago and finally took it out for the ""guys camping trip"". My husband, son and Father-in-law asked select questions from the book around the campfire each night and all 3 loved it. We bought another one since my son (age 21) decided he wanted one as well. Great conversation starter though some questions are weak. Definitely makes a person think and learn to consider deeper subjects."
2,Predictable and Pointless,"I bought this book thinking it would help me get to know my husband and friends better, but in the end, it's just a silly book with questions anyone could think up.Basically, the book is laid out in the following manner: It will as a question like: Would you do something like...eat a bug, kill a bug, or something like that. Then the book posits another question following that which goes something like this...What if eating or killing the bug would save someone's life? What if it would save your life? What if it would end world hunger? Then it asks the ~~ULTIMATE~~ question...Would you still eat or kill the bug if it were a cockroach and if it were poison??? What if it were a butterfly???Each set of questions is essentially laid out in the same way. After I'd gone through about 5 sets of questions the only question I had left was why I'd bought the book."
3,Good but there are better.,"While this book was probably the first in the question line of books it is not necessarily the best. The questions are relatively plain. If you're looking for a quiet reflective evening this is probably a good choice but if you want to rock the party with some bust out humor try some of the newer question books such as 'The Book of Strange Questions and Twisted Moral Dilemmas, Bizarro.'"
3,The book that put the genre on the map,"I really liked this book and have used it in my ESL classes for conversation topics. The questions are well thought out and the book is nicely pocket sized. However there are only 217 questions in the book. Thats only one or two a page. Other books in this geanre have now surpassed the Book of Questions like the If... series with 400 questions per book, the Book of Fabulous Questions which is divided into topics and Questions to Muse You (My own book) with about 1000 questions on a wider variety of topics."
5,Great little book,"I use this book with most of my A&D groups (teens and Adults), to open a group conversation. Good for already stablish groups but will not recommend for a new group."
4,"For Nancy Drew fans, this story offers unusual fun.","Nancy Drew comes face-to-face with a menacing robot! No, it's not science fiction--but this is an unsual entry in the mystery series. All the old friends appear, solving the mystery of an eerily constructed house and its more mysterious, vanishing owner. The twists and turns are both physical and mental, challenging anyone who enters the ominous house and all the puzzles it has--and is."
2,"Bland, unimaginative","You can only hope one day someone captures the pure erotica available vis the women in prison genre. What is hotter than women dominating women behind bars? But unfortunately, this is not it. Not that you expect much plot but this one borders on the bizarre. Fair amount of nudity, bits of simulated R rated sex, lots of hard to fathom plot. would not recommend."
3,"""Authentically Disturbing""","Less Than Zeroby Bret Easton Ellis is a slim novel at just over 200 pages, but it packs a hefty punch. Set in Los Angeles in the early 1980's, the narrative unfolds in a first person style that evokes Raymond Chandler - the most famous chronicler of a pulpy and seedy Los Angeles of the 30's and 40's. The City of Angels that Ellis chronicles, with an almost detached and documentarian eye, is filled with characters spoiled by their seemingly limitless money and privilege; any potential moral compass they once possessed has lost its true north long ago in some cocaine-fueled debauchery. It is a landscape and a story that is absolutely disturbing and frighteningly authentic."
2,NOTHING NEW HERE,"I read this book in less than two hours, and it did nothing for me. THIS IS NOT CATCHER IN THE RYE FOR THE MTV GENERATION!!! This is a decent writing for maybe a twenty year old want-to-be writer, which is what he was at the time. Personally I don't know how Ellis got this work published. I kept waiting and waiting for ANYTHING to happen, but unfortunately Ellis was not very creative. Instead he liked to talk about what people were wearing, he should have used that energy and time on thinking of all those 80's fashions, and I don't know, write a decent plot, or story. Do yourself a favor and take the money that you were going to spend on this book and buy some paper and pens and write your own story, it will probaly be more entertaining. As much as I wanted to like this novel, um sorry Bret, not very good even for a teenager."
2,disturbed but also bored...,"While I think I was able capture the point of this book and was left with the same empty hollow feeling as other readers who enjoyed it, I also felt really bored up until the end. Perhaps this is another point of the book (the fact that the characters were also so bored) that it was intended for the reader to feel this way as well? I did find it hard at times to remember who characters were because no back story was given on anyone really and they all just existed. To me this book was like ""a day in the life of""...without any history or build up..it just plugged along which frustrated me as a reader who wanted more. I can understand why others may like this book but I prefer something with a little more detail I suppose. This book doesn't leave you open to interpret anything really, there's just nothing left. When your are done reading it's like..uhh thank god. Now I can move on with my life."
1,A Waste of Time,"Bret Easton Ellis belongs to a mediocre breed that includes Dennis Cooper, AM Homes, and Jay McInerney who writes in order to shock, perhaps to hide his stylistic limitations. Less Than Zero, for example, is just two hundred pages of ramblings by a preppy druggie, interspersed with the usual snuff film encounters and gay sex. Fans of Ellis can counter by praising the ""realistic"" writing, but pick any homeless man on the street and he could write better. This book has no soul, and pity those people who compare the protagonist to Holden Caulfield. They might as well be spitting in Salinger's face."
3,3 1/2 stars*,"This book is fast paced, a short book. This novel seemed to be a story with no particular begining or end, more like a journal taken from a part of Clay's life. I was surprised at how interesting this book was even though it was, in my opinion, just a short description of someone's youth."
1,Awful,"The only good thing about this book is that it's short. There are a lot better things a person can do than hear about whinny, wasted kids that weren't beaten enough as children. As a member of ""Generation-X"", I'm pretty damnned insult with the alleged affiliation."
3,"good, but not great","considering he wrote it when he was 21, ellis got off to a great start. however, this book doesn't ever really go anywhere, and i left off wondering what was the point...however, it was an enjoyable read, would have preferred more closure on some of the characters, though"
1,this was awful!,"My book club chose this book and everyone in my book club had the same opinion....it was horrible. I don't understand why anyone would give this a high rating. It's depressing, boring, badly written, anti-climatic and some of the images actually gave me a nightmare. It seemed like the author was just trying to shock the reader because he had no talent."
2,Salinger wannbe...,"I was turned off by Less Than Zer0 when it became evident that Elias modeled his antihero, Clay, after Holden Caufield. Ellis disappointed me with this attempt at a different Catcher In the Rye. This book is no 'Catcher' and is just a waste of time. Clay and his freinds are a disgusting lot who have everything they could ever want but manage to mess it up in a world or drugs, booze, parties and fast cars. Much like the children of hollywood often do. (ie: Michael Douglas' kid)"
2,What a waste!,This book has no defined climax or conclusion. Has good detail but not a real good story line.
2,Not too bad...,"I laugh when people compare this to the Cathcer in the Rye. Umm ....no it's not even worthy of being mentioned in the same breath, although the formers influence is very evident in the book. As a piece of contempory fiction though it's not bad. It takes about an hour to read and you finish up feeling as hollow as everyone in the book. I think American Psycho was better, depsite its excesses at leats it was funny in places... this isn't."
4,Is this how I spent my life in the 80's,"Personally I found this book funny at times and sad at others. The 80's were a time of a lost generation looking to fit in. The tunes (The Go-G0's and others) make me remember why it was a great time.The drugs, the parties, the philosophy we all shared through the 80's is somewhat reflected through the pages between the covers but I must admint, as for it's literary counterpart, I found it to be poorly written and quite mundane at times.However, this book is a 4 star rating to me. Not in-so-much for the way it was written but it's capture of a ""LOST GENERATION"" or yet better known as the ""GENERATION-X"".B.E.E. is right on target with this one. The 1980's were a time of change and of question."
5,Quickest Read of My Life,"Never in my life have i read a novel at such a clip. This book is too good to put down! It was assigned to me for my english class, and i read it thrice in the time we spent studying it. That is the first and the last time i ever read a school assigned book to completing, save Harper Lee's cliche' ""favorite book"". This is my favorite book, hands down. Plus, you have to love a book that mentions Elvis Costello's ""Trust"" poster."
3,Empty,"Good, but not great. It does well by capturing the emptiness of the time in which it's set. But those looking for something more profound will probably be disappointed.It's not really shocking, as some have said. It's really just sad. It does raise a lot of societal questions about excess, commerce and family in a world driven by economy.It's worth the read, because it is does make you think and it's a quick read. However, check it out at the library before you buy it."
2,Maybe it doesn't withstand the test of time,"I wasn't as blown away by this book as I expected to be. Perhaps the changing times and a different society that exists today as compared to 1986 play a part in forming my opinion. There was nothing in the book that truly captured my imagination, nor did I find the book to be a particularly shocking portrayal of American society.The literary narrative didn't grab me, either. I found the writing to be dry and unspirited. Ellis's efforts in ""American Psycho"" were far superior.Perhaps I'm judging this book harshly and unfairly. After all, it was Ellis's first novel and it was published nearly 20 years ago. Still, it didn't entertain me, nor did it cause me to think particularly. Overall, I was disappointed."
2,Eh...,"I was looking for an author like Kurt Vonnegut and Chuck Palahniuk. And some one told me to try this guy. This book was drawn out, I spent the whole thing waiting for something to happen. Nothing happened. A bunch of self hating teenagers. A crappy version of Catcher in the Rye. It was okay I guess."
3,Catcher in the Rye in 1985 L.A.,"On the back of my book, USA Today quips, ""Catcher in the Rye for the MTV generation."" I couldn't agree with that statement more (although I really didn't care for Catcher). Less Than Zero's Clay has the cynicism and adolescent boredom of Holden Caulfield, only on a more depraved level. He surrounds himself with degenerates who lead decadent, shallow lives full of drugs, booze, sex, and money. When one character is asked, ""...What don't you have,"" he replies, ""I don't have anything to lose."" That sums up this narrative of aimless wanderings and deep unhappiness, which defines Ellis as the voice of his generation."
4,Very cute stable!,"The horse stable arrived completely assembled, with working interior light. It is very detailed! The stable itself is painted, however almost all of the small items pictured around it (anvil, wagon wheel, shovel, ladder, etc) are left white, and must be painted in place (no big deal). Figurines are prepainted, and are left to you to attach. Was ready to place on my HO board an hour after I received it. Grandchildren love it, but it isn't constructed to be played with by little fingers. All in all, a great purchase."
3,Good product...,"Very good juicer, and it does remove a decent amount of juice from the oranges. The only *minor* complaint is that this unit needs a strainer to prevent the pulp from being mixed in with the juice. This complaint, however, is not a problem or concern to me. A friend of mines uses this product too and that is her opinion."
5,Hard to believe...,This story is an education on how the powerful make decisions about wars and sell those ideas without honest and complete rationale for doing so.
2,Don't get your hopes up too high,"I bought the package in the hope that I would enjoy some of the other songs as much as ""Say you love me,"" which is one of the greatest soul songs I've ever heard. I was very disappointed. There are a lot of problems with the other songs, from weak lyrics to poor backing vocals to shaky work by the supporting musicians. You get what you pay for."
2,Not Thrilled,"I'm sorry not to be able to agree with the other reviews of Mass Confusion. I found it too technical, and without Spirit! I tried reading different chapters, thinking maybe if I read about The Eucharist, that would help, or the liturgy of the Word. But I could not find one chapter in this book that impressed me. I give the 2 stars simply for the fact that Mr. Akin went to the trouble to write the book! There are much better Catholic books out there, I recommend you save your money on this one. I also noticed that the reviews don't really talk about the contents of the book, only that it is a MUST read for every Catholic. My personal recommends are ""Crossing the Tiber"", by Steven Ray, the Catecism of the CAtholic Church, or ""The Lamb's Supper"" by Scott Hahn."
2,Disappointed in this one,"The title of this book was tantalizing, yet I was disappointed when actually digging into it. I found the long passages of Church documents on the liturgy tedious. I got the impression of someone who was stuck in the past and had sour grapes because he wasn't getting his way now. Many of his points were nit-picking and arbitrary, when the Liturgy needs to speak to the people and is done by the people. I would not reccommend this to anyone working on a liturgy committee or interested in learning about the liturgy. There are better resources out there."
3,JUST WAIT,WELL LETS JUST WAIT AND SEE HOW THIS COMES OUT TO BE.IT MAY BE ONE OF THE BEST PS2 GAMES THEIR IS AND THEN IT COULD BE THE WORST.TmS
3,Fine,"It alright, but i think Dave Mirra 2 better in many ways. BTW why are their so many reviews by people who hav'nt played the game?"
1,Sylvania DVD/VCR bust,"I recorded on the Sylvania DVD/VCR Combo for about 6 weeks. Recorded programs played back with a lot of static. I thought it was my tapes. Then one evening last week, the VCR recording did not work at all! When I put a tape in it, the VCR would shut down. I went out and brought a Samsung DVR/VCR combo at Costco. Imagine my surprise when the tapes (that I thought might be faulty) played the recorded program back perfectly. I was only able to record at SP speeed with the Sylvania DVD/VCR recorder - and that produced a lot of static when played back.So, my tapes were not faulty. I am thoroughly disappointed with my purchase of the Sylvania DVD/VCR combo through Amazon.com. Based on this experience, it is veryly unlikely I will purchase any more products through Amazon."
5,Cooks well and looks crude,"I have got to tell you two things up front. First the Amazon.com delivery was very quick. The griddle arrived two days after my purchase. Second, the cooking surface of the griddle was surprisingly rough and pitted, although the exterior bottom had a nicely textured finish. I cannot understand why Lodge uses such a crude finish for its cooking surfaces.Despite the crude appearance of the cooking surface, I followed the recommended seasoning procedure several times, and the griddle changed from gray to a very dark brown. The feel of cooking surface changed from being something resembling rough sandpaper to being something resembling rough-textured Teflon. It became quite slippery and virtually non-stick, despite having a very bumpy appearance.This griddle will never win a beauty contest, but it cooks very well. In fact, I doubt that any reader of this review will ever find a griddle that cooks better than this one. However, there are many griddles that look prettier."
5,Nice Pan,"Nice cast iron pan. Less wieght without the sides. Nice for flat pan grilling. Works great, ships fast."
1,"Great toy, poor quality",This was my favorite game as a child. I was so excited to find it on Amazon until it arrived and I was shocked by the poor quality. I don't think it would even be possible to play at all because of the way the sticks are so sloppily made. I will look for another brand.
1,"yum, delicious plastic","Prior to buying this product from Amazon I called Braun's customer service to inquire about the interior of this kettle. I wanted to know if the interior was made of plastic or stainless steel and if the water ever came in contact with plastic. I was told by a Braun representative that the interior to all their kettles is stainless but when my kettle arrived today the interior is plastic. So if you like the idea of water being heated in leaching plastic, then this is the product for you. On the other hand if you do not want any harmful plastic chemicals being leached into your hot water, then this is not the kettle for you.INTERIOR MADE OF PLASTICPlastic, its what's for dinner!"
5,VERY USEFUL,I use this kettle nearly everyday! Not just to make tea but many recipes call for HOT water and this does the trick so quickly...LOVE IT!
5,I LOVE THIS KETTLE,i recommend this kettle to anybody who has little patience for water to get heated or boiled. this is a perfect thing.take it with you when you go for vacation or use it in your house.
3,"Functional, but a little small and loud.","I'm a continuous tea drinker, so I use my water kettle every day several times a day. I got this tea kettle about 2 months ago and have enjoyed it, but there are a couple of annoying things about it. Firstly, it is loud. Most tea kettles are only slightly loud when they are to the point of boiling, but from the moment you push down the switch this one makes noise. Maybe if our kitchen wasn't next to our master bedroom I wouldn't notice, but as is, it's a little loud first thing in the morning.Secondly, I think the kettle is a little small for my taste, but that's just me personally. I can get about 3 cups of tea from it without having to fill it up again. And when I'm filling it up, the top does not open all the way which makes refilling it slightly challenging, but not too annoying.All in all it works for the tasks it needs to, but I might have spent about $15 more dollars and gotten a sleeker, larger, quieter tea kettle if I had it to do over again."
5,Pot of Water,"This is a great product! I have one but actually bought this one for my parents who are getting up there and maybe getting forgetful about shutting off burners on stove/etc. This has auto-shutoff, heats water very fast and keeps it warm. I use it to fill my French Press or to make a quick cup of tea or cocoa. A simple product that's EZ to use!Saves electricity! EZ to pour-GET ONE!==="
5,Faithful Use for Many Years,I used mine daily for 4.5 years till we made an intl move. Great product and lasts for quite awhile.
4,in hot water,"as usual, this was shipped and delivered in quick, efficient fashion and it is always kinda fun to track the item on its way-great job ...(website)-this is well made, works quickly and attractive on our countertop-the only reason I held back on giving it a 5 was that it is a hair noisy-but I am quite happy with it-Iread yours and other reviews and almost bought Krups but love being able to return this to its base without plugging into 1 specific part"
4,Great product; power cord stinks,"The title says it all. A myriad of reviews explain why it is a great product as well as listing some limitations. For me the relevant limitation is that the power cord is only one foot long. I expected plug and pour, but I had to go to the hardware store first for an extension cord. Braun, I hope you read and heed this as well as potential buyers. I am not the only one to complain."
5,boiling water in 2 min and extremely user-friendly,"Love it! I'm Asian, and we always bought the tall and heavy Asian water boilers.The German technology definitely beats it. You get hot water in a shorter amount of time and the device is safe and very easy to use (compared to Asian boilers). I fell in love with it the moment I saw it in my German friend's house.The only thing is that it cannot keep the water warm like the Asian water boilers do. But who needs it when you can boil water again in about 2 min for 5 gallons?"
3,Watch out!,"I bought this kettle for my wife for making tea. We both liked the look of the kettle and were encouraged by the positive reviews.After using the kettle only once my wife burned her hand by grabbing the handle too high and too close to the on-button. Because of the design, hot steam escapes from around the gaps between the handle and switch making them both very hot! She decided to keep the kettle but is careful now to grab the handle lower."
4,So far so good,"Had it for a month now, so far no problems, works well, heats up water pretty quickly. Nothing spectacular in terms of looks/design, but does its job."
4,Braun Electric Cordless Kettle,I got it not too long ago because I accidentally killed my stove-top kettle... by leaving it and forgetting about it because the whistling cover was left uncovered... oops.Electric kettles are definitely not as common here in the US as it is in Continental Europe; they do seem to cost a lot in the US for a quality one. I chose the German make because they are known for their quality. It's been great so far... the cordless aspect and the fact that you can do a quick 2 cups boil and definitely the automatic shut-off! I wish I had gotten it earlier!
5,"Fast, Well-Designed, Excellent Quality","I own two of these kettles, one for the office and one for home, both acquired several years ago. I've also given several of these kettles as gifts. It's the best electric kettle I've come across, ever. It boils water very quickly, it looks sophisticated on the counter, and it's easy to clean. It's also very nice that the kettle lifts off the base (instead of having to be unplugged) and that there are no exposed elements inside the kettle. Definitely my favorite and longest lasting appliance!"
3,"Functional, but Ugly.","I also bought a Black and Decker Electric Kettle for the same price. I opted for this model only after I could not get a second B&W. Both work well, but the B&W is an elegant kettle in the traditional sense while this Braun plastic penguin is just plain unsightly. I'd estimate its real value to be quite a bit lower than the B&W."
3,Let down by Braun,"I bought my kettle after a careful review and search - it was the only one I could find in the stores! I loved it for just over a year and it provided sterling service - poured great (very important)I even used it to fill pans on the stove so I didn't have to waste time and energy boiling the water in the pan. Thereafter it started leaking periodically so I thought was my fault. Eventually it flooded my countertop with regularity. Not very safe I know, so very annoyed I tossed it and bought a Bodum which looked great but has broken already (melted!!!) In England we used to keep kettles for years without mishap. I guess they don't make them like they used to."
3,Leaks water,"Even though the kettle failed after less than two years of service and the leaking problem appears in the reviews to be common, I can't give it a single star. It is a no-nonsense appliance, very enjoyable to use. Everything in it is cleverly thought through, except for the untimely leaking problem.I'd never recommend wasting money on extended warranties, but this is one of very few items that may be worth additional warranty, if available, for at least 3 extra years."
3,Great until it starts leaking!,"We bought this kettle in January of 2008 and it worked great for 10 months. And then, it started to leak. Of course, no warranty, no returns. What can I say -- was it worth the $50 investment? You be the judge. I now have to buy another one...but not Braun."
3,"Great kettle, short life span","We loved our kettle while it lasted. Used several times per day, heats the water super-fast, but we've had it only 14-18 months, and the switch to turn it on suddenly went kaput. I will probably buy another, however, because the the plastic exterior keeps us from getting burnt; the kettle is light-weight and the water heats quickly. Too bad the quality on the switch is a problem - a number of other users posted the same experience."
5,I love this kettle!,"When I purchased this kettle there was no photo and by doing a google with the product number I expected to receive a stainless steel kettle with black trim. Well, I now believe the the ""W"" in the product code signifies white but the description today says it is gray.White doesn't bother me and I've found this kettle to be great. It has a good feel -- substantial and not a cheap-o. I had a Bodum kettle prior to this but managed to break off the lid trying to fill it. The Braun lid design is so much better I can't believe I put up with the other for so long."
2,Good for no more than a year,"We had had two of these kettles and both started leaking terribly after about a year of use. The first time we had a bit of a damage done to it, so it was understandable. We bought a second one and it leaks much much more than the first one with 0 damage. Every morning I wake up to a puddle on my table. Would not recommend this product."
5,Mother of All Water Kettles!!!,"Recently bought this item. Very fast shipping, I'm impressed and it's free. If you're looking for the best water kettle around, this would be it. The design is very ergonomic. Quick water boiling too. It's a pleasure to use. Highly recommended!!!"
4,Works very well.,"This was my first electric kettle and I was very pleased. Water boils in seconds. Very impressed. The only con is that it uses a lot of electricity when it shuts off. I live in an apartment and every time is would shut off, the fuse would blow. Overall, it is a good kettle if you have the power to support it."
1,Braun was a dud,"Just purchased the Braun WK200W and was disappointed. Packed great, plug looked great, nice and short, but after plugging in, the base kind of got warm and after 10 minutes the water still wasn't lukewarm."
3,Reads like a thriller.,"Hancock's work is very readable and easy to follow. This one, although not quite as good as ""Fingerprints of the Gods,"" is also sometimes hard to put down and often reads like a mystery/thriller. I think I just wasn't as interested in the ark of the covenant as I was in the material in the other book. But there's a lot of interesting information here that I've never seen anyplace else. Lovers of ancient history will probably enjoy it."
5,Entertainingly speculative and a good read.,"As an archaeologist I enjoy reading modern views of ancient mysteries. Hancock is an excellent writer and could probably convince most people that the earth was flat if he wished it. Although I disagree with Hancock's placement of the Ark of the Covenant, The Sign and the Seal is a great source for the early history of the Ark and Ethiopian mythology. His tale reads like a detective story and a great adventure rolled in one"
2,Too annoying,"I was using version 12 and liked it well enough. I reinstalled when I got a new computer that had XP on it and it would not install, so I thought upgrading to the latest version would help. It did install, but the software has more quirks than the last one. It has somehow linked itself with other programs and so when I try to use my CD burning software or Legacy software (a geneology program) it wants to open PrintShop first and considering how slow this program is at opening that isn't pleasant. I've reinstalled numerous times and the problem hasn't gone away. I also find this program more awkward in trying to create things like a simple greeting card. If you can tolerate the annoyances (like if you delete the icon from the desktop it thinks it isn't installed) then you might enjoy the features this program has, but personally I just now hopped online to find myself a program by a different company."
1,sorry piece of junk!,The best thing I can say is DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE! I did and Now I am stuck with a piece of worthless junk which I cannot return. I cannot even talk to the people at amazon.com... they sell it to you then forget about you. I will never do business with them again!!
1,NOT Recommended,"This is one of the worst programs I have ever used. It isn't user friendly,and if you have children that would like to use the program forget it. Very few sentiments included with this program, manipulation of the text is difficult, if you want any art work you have to go online to get it. not recomended at all."
2,Would not stay running.,"Beware!! The one that i recieved was new in box,but from the get go it would not stay running.I havent tried the adjustment screw yet,but im gonna see if that may fix it.I am trying not to have to send it back and pay shipping.Hopefully i can get it running right.Just be careful because i bought it because of the reviews and ended up getting a bad one.This is the only product i have gotten from Amazon that has not worked properly."
4,Rode Deadcat,Great at reducing wind noise. Only thing is on a Panasonic SD-700 it can fall into the top right of the screen so you have to be careful not to zoom right out with it mounted. I assume it would be similar with other camcorder too?
4,"Decent, but use only with Rode products","OK-My bad--I bought this to use with a Sennheiser ME66 (trying to find something cheaper than Sennhieser products). Works OK, but a little small for my ME66--doesn't cover completely. Still helps some conditions, but for high wind, I still have to use a blimp. Good constuction, and a good value."
2,disappointed,The velcro dos not much at the end of the mic! if you have hard wind you have nice! thanks
3,Not for the Zoom 4,"This product was suggested as an additional purchase on Amazon when I purchased my Zoom 4 recorder. While the product arrived quickly and it was very well priced, it really wasn't meant for the Zoom recorder. It seems as though it's meant for a shotgun mic. The Zoom has a specific size and shape to its mics that this wind muff is too long to fit. If I were to rate it on it's own merits, I would give it 5 stars (this is for price and appearance of quality-I had to return it, so I never opened it)."
2,Meh - Go with the Rode WS6,I bought this a few years ago for my Rode NGT-2. It comes in handy but I'm really not impressed by it. It blocks out a brief breeze or 2 but beyond that you are going to have awful audio because this thing can't stop bigger gusts of wind. I'm going to buy the Rode WS6 which from youtube test videos looks FAR more able to block out wind and a big price cut has been made so I'm stepping it up.
4,"Good working, same as everyone else with price","Slightly overpriced, but it's better than getting crappy sound without.FYI: Make sure you put it over the foam piece that already came with your mic. I tried it on the bare mic and it was way too big, and only then did I realize from the box that the windcat itself is supposed to go over the foam piece, which in turn goes directly over the mic."
4,"Legendary saxx player in Canterbury, Britjazz, and avant-garde circles...","The late Gary Windo (1941-1992) played sax with a wide variety of talented people, and this memorial collection features a lot of them -- Carla Bley, Michael Mantler, Roswell Rudd, Robert Wyatt, Hugh Hopper, John Marshall, Lol Coxhill, Pye Hastings, Steve Hillage, Bill MacCormick, Nick Mason, Mark Charig, Nick Evans, Evan Parker, Mongezi Feza, Louis Moholo, Harry Beckett, Harry Miller, Julie Tippets, Steve Swallow, D.Sharpe..."
5,Amazing!,I have sensitive gums so I started using Sensodyne Extra whitening. My gums don't bleed anymore when i brush & only after a month of using it my teeth are at least 3 shades whiter....i'm sooo happy! I strongly reccomend this product!!!
3,"""Enclosed is a photo (it's not me, though)""","My rating for this CD hovers between three and four stars; it's a good album, but not as good as it could have been (listen to a couple of the tunes a few times and the Supernaturals start to sound like Cast - disturbing).""I wasn't built to get up"" is a great song, but the version on the album sounds muffled and under-produced - not as good as the version that got so much airplay as a single. Some of the lyrics come across as cheesy, but in a few songs they shine ""You laugh at my jokes but not as much as she did"" in Sheffield Song, and ""I walk round Safeway on my own"" in Everest.So... this album is OK, but the best intro to The Supernaturals is the CD1 of 'I wasn't built to get up' - the two B-sides there ('I just can't go on like this' and 'Robot Song') are funny and poignant - perfect Supernatural pop."
3,This is the only place I could find non waxed floss. Am unable to hold the floss if it if waxed.,"The floss is about half the diameter, and double the price, of the floss I was using. Hard to find no-wax floss these days. Found an old container of this very floss, same except the floss is wound on a wooden spool. Any collectors out there ?"
2,"Great for tight spaces, but not great for removing plaque","Easy to use because it glides into tight spaces, but after a year of using this product, my hygienist said it wasn't sufficient to remove plaque because it is too thin. She recommended using the thickest floss I could get between my teeth. Now that I have 12 rolls of this, I double it up so it is thicker, and use it that way. When I go through these rolls, I'll start buying the woven floss from now on."
3,hard to follow,"While it is a nice workout, some of the moves are embarassing if someone else is in the house. Also It is hard to follow, sometimes Denise does a couple reps of something before telling you that you have moved on to the next thing, so you have to watch carefully. I love Denise Austin, but this is not one of her best tapes."
3,It's alright,"I agree with most of the rest of you... about how all of a sudden Austin decides to change moves without informing anyone... but what i REALLY found funny was the olive skinned, maybe Latino guy in red in the far right (first segment). he was obviously exhausted halfway thru the workout.I think this tape is decent, but i wouldn't rely on this tape soley for your workout needs."
5,Confusing at first but good once you get the hang of it!,"When I first tried out the video, I was soooo confused! She didn't explain the moves at all like she does in Ultimate Fat Burner but once I got the hang of them, I was more prepared the second time. I don't think this is the best for beginners but I use her tapes all the time and I am used to her style. She is motivating and yeah she does have a very resonating voice but I enjoy her overall! I recommend this for intermediate or advanced exercisers! I sweat a lot in just 20 mins!"
1,Not what I expected,"I have had a raintower elevated sprinkler for many years and needed another one. I didn't realize this unit was a different brand since the price was similar. This one is very flimsy and doesn't have self leveling feet. The other unit is made of conduit, stays upright and levels on any terrain. Shame on Nelson for producing such an inferior product with too high a price. The box was destroyed on arrival and the shipping will be too much to return it so I am stuck with it. Steer clear and buy an official raintower unit."
2,Dull but tries hard,"This book achieves what it aims to do. It gives an overview of some of Gann's ideas and explains his 50% retracement rule in almost painful detail.I understand the frustration of the previous two reviewers. The book is poorly edited and full of typographical errors. Because it contains a lot of detailed workings, there is a tendency for the eye to skip over that detail. I can imagine that is exactly what the editor's eye did. Hence the typos.This book is not worthless though. It contains some sound advice about the importance of employing systematic analysis and the disciplined use of stops. It also provides a simple but reasonably effective trading technique. On the other hand, it is dull and too long. The general technique is also covered more succinctly and interestingly in other trading books.It is not worth the ""new"" price but a cheap secondhand copy or, even better, a loaner might be worth the effort"
2,Nada especial,"Mi opinión es que Isabel Allende es una destacada autora de novela histórica hispanoamericana, y ello lo hace excelente. Cuando incursiona en autobiografías, biografías, novela juvenil, etc. pierde su encanto, se humaniza. ""El Plan Infinito"" no es nada especial, describe ambientes que no le son propios y por ello falla. Es entretenido y nada más, pero uno de Isabel Allende espera lo siempre destacado y fuera de parámetro, y este no es el caso."
1,Corrupted my files and customer service stinks!,"Installed program and when re-booted, couldn't get into my computer at all. Called them and was told I would have to go to tech support on line. Told him I couldn't get on line or into my computer and he told me to go to a neighbor's or friend's house! I still wouldn't have been able to correct problem without being at my computer. Had to call Compaq tech support and it cost me $60.00 and 40 minutes to be walked through the fix.I hate this piece of garbage and am really angry. Hate to see anyone else get taken."
2,New Company - Worse Product,"Look @ the box /screens. Instead of Broderbund its now Riverdeep & with that change the program has changed as well. I installed it & have uninstalled it. The screens look ""cheaper"". I like using the ""Fine Art"". There are far less Fine Art images in newer version. More upsetting is the false advertising. Box states ""310,000+ images"" (deluxe) where in reality MOST of these are online & secondly if you want to use MOST of those you have to pay another $20-30 to join their Million image club to use them?? Reinstalled old version 15. Why is new not better? I also keep a special PC w/all my old classic 96/97 programs!"
2,"too much talking,hard too watch","like wishbone ash saw them in the early 70's,great band.this is not a concert lots of talking.try another one,i probably will"
5,Excellent product,Have used StriVectin SD for years and continue to find it the best moisturizer for face and neck.I like this original version better than the new formula.
5,StriVectin,"Great cream at a great price, love it. I use it as a moisturizer in the morning and evening. Will recommend to all women."
3,"It's okay, but...","I purchased this item because of a review I saw in the local newspaper. I just can't get used to it because it is so lightweight. It does a good job, but peelings get stuck in the blade area frequently and have to be rinsed out. I honestly have been using my old OXO."
2,Weak design as others have posted,"Mine broke in the same way as described by others. Also, the blade housing had broken a while ago, I was able to glue that back together. It was a really great tool while it worked but weak design means I can't recommend it."
3,great game but......,"one cannot avoid compering this game with transworld surf. myself? i enjoyed TWS much more than KSPS.if you are a surfer you should have both but if you dont have a choice i would recomend trans world surf game.kelly's game is slightly confusing, the graphics are not better than TWS like someone mentioned.TWS has a better understanding of surfing, they put less tricks but their moves and tricks resemble reality at least (asides of the special tricks that are hard to pull).in kelly game you can do everything on a wave, this makes the game a little .again, both games are worth buying and i even wanted to give this one 4 stars (i gave TWS 5..) but with all the good reviews i thought its time to get real."
1,Consider a LeCreuset unless you're really using this outside,"I've have had this Dutch oven for the last 8 years and I'm sure it will outlast me. But I am also sure that for my offspring it also will be a bizarre relic as they wonder why one of their ancestors every put up with curing and cleaning and curing this when there was a perfectly good alternative in the cabinet. I wonder that too. Unless you are taking this out the the fire pit for outdoor cooking, I would highly recommend the equivalent Le Creuset models. They are enamel-coasted, painless to clean, and very heavy duty -- I expect to pass this one on as well. They distribute heat much better and have such contemporary innovations as a lid-handle NOT made of very heat-conductive metal.For outdoor use, I guess this is a sturdy bet (15 lbs) but know that this will require cleanup and care when you get home."
3,Not very original,"This game is exactly like THPS2 for Gameboy Advance. It is a fun game with good graphics, but don't buy it if you have Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2."
5,Raw Heat!,"Project Pat delivers in your face lyrics, raw beats and that hard southern rhythm you just can't find anywhere else. This is one of the very few CD's that I can listen to every single track without skipping one song, now that takes pure raw talent from one of southern's finest! The beats are phenomenal and the album is flawless!"
1,OUTDATED and NONRETURNABLE!,"These Sharkies were outdated when I received them, and I was informed online that they are not returnable. I have been on the phone for fifteen minutes with an Amazon representative who is impossible to understand, and keeps asking the same questions over and over. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER on Amazon."
1,Dont buy this,I will try to return this. I cant use it. It breaks my neck. No matter how well I adjust it It DOES NOT WORK. All the weight from my son hangs around My neck. I have tried all positions and none work. Do not buy this item. YOu will not like it
3,super collapse 3,"The game was exactly what they said it would be. Some people love it, others don't get too excited by it. If your a Tetris person, this game is right up your alley."
4,Lodge 2-1/2 Quart Cast Iron Deep Fryer Kit,"Can't go wrong with Lodge and this fryer is no exception. 2 1/2 quarts is small enough to store with your other pans, but large enough to fry for 2-4 people. Would be nice if it came with a lid so you could store the oil inside."
3,Not as good as my old one.,"I previously owned a Rock Mountain Radar for over 10 years and did not hesitate to buy another one. However, this one seems slow on the draw. It goes off as you are right on top of a signal. Does not give you much warning at all."
5,Mans last week on earth,"A macabre story of mankinds last seven days on earth. This book was written in the late 1950's and at the height of the Cold War. In a nutshell rioting begins in communist Poland, the USSR invades, riots spread to East Germany, and so on. The book has 5 or 6 main characters, and we trace the end of the world through their eyes. We see the end unfold through the eyes of both soldiers and civilians. This is not an uplifting read, as the book is divided into ""7 days"", and man does not survive the 7th. I found the book hard to put down. Growing up during the Cold War, I first read this book in 1982 or 1983, and it was timely then. I have since read it again in 2005. Its still a good read."
2,not pleased,"I am very disappointed. It said they were high quality, but they are a cheap plastic. They look like animals you can find at the dollar store. It also said thy were realistic, but the dog and goat were the same size as the adult cow and horse. I would not spend this much money on this quality of item. You are better off spending a little extra money and getting a really nice set at Lakeshore."
3,First time was a charm...,"The first time I ran this thing, I tried making a fruit smoothie, it chopped the ice just fine, no problems. The next time I tried it, the machine kept getting hung up and couldn't chop all of the ice. I had to continually push the ice down into the machine. Did the first run dull the blades that quickly?"
5,The Best Book to grow up with as a preteen,I love this book i read it when i was in the 6th grade...I am normally not the type to be reading...but i started reading this book and i enjoyed it so much when i was done now i'm in 10th grade and till this day i wont ever forget it....It's like the exact life a 13 year old would experience....I would recommend this book to every teenage girl that has guys as one of their interests like i do!!
2,Wrong size bulb - my fault I think,I'm sure the item is great - it if was the size I wanted... I wish there was more descriptions listed for products; sizes in particular.
5,Ray's Review,This cd is better than any other cd out there its the best ever made buy grits. If you like grits now you will love them after listening to this cd.
2,Make this battery better.,I have to sell the Ryobi saw. This battery is good only for a few minutes of use. Not happy!
4,Excellent,This is a great book to get you warmed up. It covers many of the topics that are covered on the boards and if you find that time is short and that you were unable to prepare for the exam this is the book to use as a last resort.
2,Only pen my husband will use,"This pen is my husband's all-time favorite. However, this is the 3rd one I've had to buy for him because after using it daily, the cap loosens, eventually not staying on at all, and the cartridge falls out. He says, after using this pen for YEARS, he'll never buy another one."
3,Problem with plastic gear,"I bought this blender about four months ago (around Nov. '05) and have been using it about three times a week since then. I've been using it mostly for making smoothies with frozen fruits. It blends the smoothies fast and with little effort.However, a couple of weeks ago one of the small plastic teeth that drive the blades broke off while it was blending. There are five or six teeth left, and the blender has been working well in the last couple of weeks. Still, I am pretty disappointed with the short life of the plastic gear. Obviously, with one tooth missing, the remaining ones need to do more work, so I assume they won't last very long. 50 bucks for four months of problem-free blending is not exactly cost-effective.Also, the other weird thing about the blender is the fact that the plastic gear is fairly difficult to screw on the glass jar. My wife can't attach the two unless she puts a drop of oil on the thread."
2,RIP!,"Was thrilled with the first use: blender was powerful & quiet, a little leaking around the lid but it let the steam out of a hot soup. Was worried with the second use when I discovered oil leaking from the bottom of the blades. It died on the third use. $50 is pretty expensive for a blender that doesn't even make it into dacquiri season!"
4,Great for Frozen Drinks,"We bought this blender primarily to make frozen drinks in. It does a great job of crushing the ice to a pleasant consistency with no chunks. It took us a few tries to the ice just right (needed to work on the amount of liquid to add), but once we figured it out, we love it. Definitely worth the price."
1,Stay away!,"This blender broke after three years of medium use. Something is stripped inside of the drive motor and it will spin but slips and does not spin the blender. Don't buy this blender, and don't buy a Braun."
1,"Within 2 years, broke twice, cheap plastic gear","Just adding to all the negative completes to bring the star rating down. Glad to see they are currently unavailable, its about time they stop making such a non-reliable blender, that even with warranty still have to pay for shipping to have it fixed. Cheap plastic everyone is talking about broke on me twice the past two years. There are much better options out there I just bought a oster professional series blender, I hope it does a better job then this blender did."
4,so far so good,"its blendinig well, but do notice a hot or burning type smell when using at hight speed, seems to getting less noticable with the more we use it"
2,"Loved it until it broke, plastic teeth","A few months ago we searched for a new blender, and the trustworthy consumer magazine rated this one a good buy. In this case the magazine was wrong (although I still trust and use their recommendations). We bought this blender on their recommendation despite reports of broken plastic teeth. After a couple of weeks of making smoothies the same thing happened to ours. It seems that Braun could spend an extra $5 to make teeth that hold up, and this blender would STILL be a good value if it were $5 more expensive, but believe the reports, the plastic teeth break easily and quickly with any hard use!"
1,long-term reliability problems,"Crushes ice, etc. as advertized, but the ""teeth"" on the bottom of the jug broke off, and I can't find a replacement assembly. The weak link in an otherwise strong chain. It is a shame that a few pennies of plastic can compromise a $50 blender."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this blender (like other reviewers) based on consumer reports recommendation. I had it only 6 months. The plastic gears have stripped twice, and the teeth on the bottom of the jar have broken too. This is a cheaply made blender, which worked OK for smoothies, but I would not recommend it over any other cheap blender. I had the blender repaired under warranty the first time, but won't waste my time now that it broke again. Save your money."
3,After 1 year,"It's Okay, I probably won't buy this brand again. My blender or maybe it's the blades, it just doesn't seem to crush, blend, or chop the ingredients as well as consumer reports reported. Marty"
3,Braun MX2050 PowerMax Jug Blender,The blender is very strong and is working very well.The Glass Jug is too heavey and would be better served as a plastic.The Knob is hard to change when your hands are wet.Buttons I think are better.Over all I would say it is a very good deal for the cost of the mixer.
4,Good but---,This is an excellent blender. The only disappointment was that the base will not fit a standard Mason Jar. This prevents use with a small standard jar in the US. Whether it fits a European jar is unknown.
2,Teeth break off the blade,"Even though this product rated highly in reviews, we were disappointed - the teeth that mate the blade assembly with the motor housing are plastic, and break off."
5,"Braun Blender, MX2050 Power Max Jug blender","This blender is tops with my family. Makes great margarittas, crushes ice great!! Very quiet compared others!! Loved mine so much, I bought this one for my son and his wife."
5,Braun Blender,"After 8 years of daily use my Vita Mix needed to be replaced. The Braun MX2050 PowerMax Jug Blender was recomended so I gave it a try. I love it!!! It works every bit as good at blending (if not better) as the Vita Mix. It's pretty, more compact, lots of power, and much more affordable. I highly recomend it to anyone looking for a new blender!!Jenny from Minnesota"
4,No Longer Waiting in Colorado,"After four calls, Braun's customer service warranty division has come through. Believe it or not they actually exceeded my expectations! I really believed my PowerMax 2050 blender would go to the appliance graveyard under the kitchen sink. However, Braun did not send only the blade assembly parts; they actually replaced the entire blender. I was truly at a loss for words and felt somewhat guilty for my earlier review. Now that I'm up and running again, I am again in awe of the power and design of this blender! Even the pouring capability from the triangular jug beats everything out there in the market. I look forward to Braun's new and improved version of this blender (minus the plastic spokes). I will definitely be one of the first to buy!"
5,We love this blender!,"After seeing this blender reviewed in Cook's Illustrated, we decided to give it a try. It is everything they said it would be--easy to use, easy to clean, powerful. And we love that the jug is glass--no warping in the dishwasher!!"
1,Dead in Less than a Year,"I ordered this item to give as a gift. It was shipped on September 1, 2005 - on August 25, 2006, it died. The bill for repair was $90.00 - a great deal more than the item cost. Save your money. This is not an item to spend your money on."
4,Go ahead and buy it!,"We've owned several blenders of different models and hope this one lasts longer than previous ones. Hubby uses blender 2-3 x daily for shakes mixed with ice, ice cream, & fruits. Since arrival last week, blender has been great chopping up ice, blending all ingredients smoothly. Pleasantly quiet motor; substantial weight (not flimsy); visually appealing (fine to leave in open view on counter top). Following reviews including ""best buy"" recommendation from Consumer Reports, this appears to have been a wise purchase...PLUS we beat the suggested price of $50, another added bonus! Too early to rate it 5 stars, but I expect it will!"
3,Three years of good service but now it's dead,"I purchased this blender in July of 2006 after a good review in Consumer Reports. The splash-up problem I solved by holding a cloth or towel over the top, but within weeks of daily use I noticed that one of the blade teeth had cracked. The blender still functioned, however. Last winter I noticed that a second set of blade teeth had cracked, so I ordered a (fairly expensive) replacement blade to have on hand when enough teeth broke to stop the machine from working. Alas, before I needed the replacement blade, the motor mount apparently came loose and while preparing a smoothie with frozen mango, the machine started to roar at any speed and ""walk"" across the counter.That was yesterday. Today I spent an hour reading online reviews. Now that I know the problem wasn't just a production blip, I ordered a new blender from another manufacturer. Here's hoping the experience is better."
5,More than pleased,"I am a serious cook who expects much from and takes good care of my equipment. Consumer Reports rated this blender very highly. I was prepared to pay much more for a blender and get a Viking or Kitchen Aide, but they were not rated as highly as the Braun. I could not find the Braun model in the stores to compare, but I took a chance and ordered it sight unseen from Amazon. This Braun machine has done all that has been asked of it and more. The canister is larger and the blades sit higher and are more effective than any I've worked with in the past. Like all blenders this one is noisy too, but that is unavoidable--it requires a heavy-duty motor in a small housing. In short, I recommend this Braun blender very highly."
1,"Also, very disappointing","I tried to use this blender several times with placing the canister in different positions to lock it down. It vibrated all over the counter and I had to place my hand on the top and hold it down to keep it from falling off. Also, had a horrible burning smell. I checked with Braun the Mfg. and they said this is a manufacturing problem with this blender and had received numerous complaints about this problem.The woman in customer service at Braun said she also purchased this same model and had the same problem. I guess this is why you can't find it in any of the dept. stores. I sent it back to Amazon.com and they agreed to a complete refund."
1,Broken in 6 months,"I bought this Blender because of positive reviews in a major cooking magazine. The blade stopped turning within 6 months. I got a replacement part by driving 35 miles to the only repair facility in the area. I had to take the entire blender with me. Now, within less than a year from purchase, the blender won't even turn on. This blender was only used, perhaps two dozen times."
1,Don't bother,"I was excited about purchasing this blender based on reviews from a ""unbiased"" consumer magazine. It did crush ice well compared to others I've owned, but after a month, the plastic pieces that connect the blender to the base unit were breaking off -- they should've been made with stronger plastic or a totally different material that would hold up. Don't waste your money."
1,This blender was a huge disapointment,"We heard all the great reviews and thought we would give it a try, the second time we used it the blade bound up on the spindle and the motor started smoking. I had to take every thing apart and re-adjust it. IT worked fine for a while then the little plastic piece on the bottom broke, so we sent for a new one when we got the new piece we put it in and then a few more mixes is all we got out of it before the motor burned up completely!!!!!! If you like to make smoothies with frozen ingredients I would think twice about this one."
2,Broken Down and Still Waiting,"After MUCH research, I was so excited to receive this blender. I enjoy making frozen fruit smoothies and needed a powerful blender that would last longer than the mainstay market blenders. This unit had excellent reviews.Unfortunately, after about a month of making smoothies, I went to put the blender on the base and noticed one of the spokes falling off the jug into the base! I thought, ""Oh no, my new blender has a major flaw, plastic spokes!"" It only took another week before all of the spokes broke off.Since early July, I have called, called and recalled Braun's warranty/customer service department, who have told me each time that my part would be shipped that week. Here I am in September and I'm STILL WAITING for my part! Apparently Braun is busy making blenders, but not making the replacement parts for those of us who took the leap of faith to purchase this blender prior to the ""Consumer Reports"" spotlight review. I wonder if I'll still be waiting in December?"
2,Excellent blender... for 4 months ONLY,"I can't deny that the blender was very good WHILE IT WORKED. However, after 4 months using it the motor burned!! Smoke came from the bottom of the blender. I send it straight to the trash. Not recommended."
1,Not worth it,"This is nothing more than a pamphlet machine copied from a surviving sales brochure. Just a few pages, most of which are illegble due to water damage or something like that. Not worth the time nor the money. Skip by this one."
2,Just OK,"This is an ok work out. Chris is very high energy as usual, but some of the leg work she does includes a lot of squats which can be hard on the knees if you are not super careful."
4,good book to help me get through the grow out,"This book was bought so that I could have some positive reenforcement on the shelf during the difficult grow out phase. The pictures where well done and had what I was hoping for as far as having a variety of hair types, ethnicities, face shapes, ages etc. The advice regarding the makeup and hair care was fine. I took off one star because I would have liked even more pictures. I thought this book did a fine job of staying out of the feminism-political argument about whether or not its OK to buy in to the game to try to stay young. I think each individual woman will figure that out on their own depending on their background, personal ethics, and own research. This book is for women who have been into moderate to heavy beautifying. If you've honored your natural beauty then you probably free from having too many concerns in this area. When ever I needed a burst of reassurance I flipped through a few pages."
3,Alaska Atlas &Gazetteer,I'm not satisfy with this map book. It was published 2010 but most of the routes/streets with name that were done way before 2009 was not in the map. Some of the country side roads and trials were missing in the map. I bought a book of Wisconsin and I can find most of the rural routes in person that were on the map but not with this one of Alaska. This map book is not so accurate because roads missing. I would not recommend anyone to buy this Alaska one.
5,Excellent office Atlas for those doing buisness in Alaska,"If you need to locate a remote village or river anywhere in Alaska this will do it. Great detail, clear and well organized to find places quickly. To big for travel but great for the office."
4,every detail about Alaska.....too big to carry though,"the map has every detail that we need for planning a trip to Alasks. With this map, you don't need the 1x1 USGS map. However, this map book is kind of too big to carry on a light hiking."
4,About this subwoofer..,"I bought this subwoofer about 2 years ago from Amazon.com and I was pleased the day it came. It is placed in a room that has cement walls and a cement floor, and it still delivers bass you can hear and feel. I run it with a 500 watt surround sound reciever, and it is used with large speakers.I haven't had any problems with the subwoofer thus far. Some of the other reviews list the amp getting hot fast at high sound levels, and after a few hours at loud volumes, yes, the amp will get hot. Shutting it down for a few minutes, though, will cool it, and prevent any damage due to overheating. As far as performance, this subwoofer can handle relatively high volumes without distortion. Basically, for the price and sound quality, it is a good buy for anyone interested in adding the low-end sound to their system."
1,Two have blown,"My first one lasted less than a month. Blew it's fuse and when I replaced the fuse, it just made a loud hum. The amp was blown. I have an HK510 AVR with sub-out, so I know I didn't give it too much juice. I was skeptical to get another one, but decided to try in hopes I just got a lemon. Amazon was great and paid for shipping both ways. The second one lasted a few months and then the exact same thing. I sent an email on Sunday to thier customer support and got both an email and phone call from them on Monday. They told me they are aware of the problem and have a fix. They are having me just send the amp, so I don't have to pack up and send this beast. Good customer support so far."
4,Very cute!,"Unfortunately, my little girl still only played with the manufacturer's tag! But the quality was good! She did like the inside rattle though!"
2,MORE FRUSTRATION THAN FUN :(,This Taggies toy is not much fun for baby at all! It's too difficult for even a year old baby too pull out the pink vibrating piece and when you pull it out for baby the cord is so short it literally moves for 3 seconds max! Lastly it does not hold it's shape and flattens out over time even with barely any play time on it. For the price there are MUCH better toys out there!
4,Great for grabby hands!,"The taggie elephant is cute and makes a great jingly sound, too. I think I might have gotten this toy a bit late for my baby (around 7 months). By the time I found it and got it to her, I think we missed the nutty for tags stage. She still likes it for the stuffed animal and jingly aspect, though."
1,Simplistic Not Simple,"This book is more idiotic tripe along the lines of ""One Minute Manager"" and ""Who Moved My Cheese?""As other reviewers have said, if the authors know so much about apologizing, they should apologize to every reader of their book(s) for wasting time that could have more productively been used waiting for the subway or staring at the wall or something.It is amazing the number of managers who have been brainwashed into thinking that bedtime stories for six-year olds are ""good business reading."""
4,"Liked the pattern, too many grey marks after 4 years of use.","I bought this stoneware from Amazon about 4 years ago and loved the pattern. After 4 years, there were too many grey steaks and chips on the plates and bowls and I did not want to fuss with special removing gels. I didn't pay too much for it, so I am not really complaining.I found out the grey marks and chipping is common in stoneware and this time around I bought a service for 12 in Lenox, bone china. Hopefully I will keep the new set longer than 4 years."
4,Great natural toner for summer,"I have combination skin and shiny t-zone. I was looking for a toner or a lightweight moisturizer for this hot and humid summer. I find the rose water work really well as a natural toner: mattifying, hydrating, and nice smell.The bottle I have received comes with spray top so it is very easy to apply. It is easily absorbing, does a great job at mattifying my face naturally, keeps my t-zone from getting oily for almost the whole day. It hydrates as good as a lightweight moisturizer if I apply several layers on my face. But usually I spray a thin layer and apply a lightweight cream afterword. It smells very refreshing and soothing."
3,Kristel,"I do not know if the acne increased due to this product or due to my bad alimentation and my stressful life. It smells good. So I quit and I wait. So, better to taste this product another time when my acne quits out."
4,Good product!,Good product!.......Shea Terra Organics Pure Moroccan Rose Water 4 oz.....can be added to other things.... I'd buy again and would recommend to others!~
4,Southern Charm at its Best,"Bev Marshall's Right as Rain is a well crafted novel. The characters are realistic yet unpredictable. At times I felt as entangled in their lives as the characters in Gone with the Wind.The Southern flavor that runs throughout the novel is charming and believable. Tee Wee and Icey were so vividly described that I felt I knew them all my life; I watched their families grow as the neighbors in my own hometown. My only disappointment was the court trial that took place at the end of book. I felt it was a little drawn out. When I was ready for this novel to conclude and finalize the characters' lives, it began an arduous court scene. However, I would recommend this book to my friends and would definitely give it as a gift. I'm looking forward to reading other books by Mrs. Marshall. Thank you Mrs. Marshall for capturing the true essence of southern charm that is still alive and well!"
5,great little sprinkler,"I bought this because my neighbor had one and it works great. I move it to corners and set the guides for 90 degree watering, or along the edge of the yard for 180 degree watering. It has an adjustable flow tip so you can make a long thin stream of water or close scattered watering. Simple to use."
2,"Cheap, flimsy and poorly made","Sadly this was one of the higher rated easels on Amazon and I really wanted a small wooden one.The box it came in was all beaten up and looked like it had been sitting around for 20 years :(One of the brass-like bolts was loose in the box but wasn't a big deal to put back on.The arms that lock the back tip WAY in, and look like they will break the flimsy tabs on the bottom in a short time.Finish is not even, not quality and the wood was poorly sanded.Doesn't sit flat and rocks back and forth.If this was $1 at a discount store it might be worth it, but not at this price.Will spend some time this weekend trying to get it to sit flat, though it's very likely it's going right back.This is the first bad thing I've ever gotten on Amazon, but I always know I can trust them to make it right."
5,"Yay, a sequel!","The Castle in the Attic was one of my favorite books as a child, and thanks to LibraryThing, I was made aware of the sequel. In The Battle for the Castle, William returns to the realm of the Silver Knight, and with the help of his friend, Jason, and the fair maiden Gudrin, is able to save the castle from another dark and mystical threat: a plague of rats.I was a little disappointed by this story, as it seamed really rather anticlimactic and not as well plotted as it's predecessor, but it was good to meet up with William again and see how well he's grown up. Gudrin was an engaging and high-spirited addition to the action as well.I would recommend this fantasy story to parents reading to their kids at bedtime, unless they're really prone to nightmares. On second thoug"
5,A great medieval tale for children young and old.,"I am a teacher in New York teaching the Middle Ages to sixth graders. They love this book because it is well-written, and goes along with our curriculum, a fun read for the children, yet, has so many facts about castles and the way they were used in those times. The children can relate to William, Jason , and the girl, Gudrun, because the decisions they make are the same they would have made. Real action at the end. Can we have more from Ms. Winthrop?"
4,"Yeah, could be cheaper for its quality.","The product that came was quite used and a little battered here and there but overall, it works pretty fine. It's great for its price but it could be less, for the quality. But hey, it came with batteries. Thats it. Just the unit itself and the batteries. Everything else you would have to get online or buy it. :C."
3,not stunning at least for me.,"I find that I get about 2 solid hours of battery life with this battery in the balanced energy mode on my computer. screen brightness is only at 4 and not max. don't understand why battery life is so short. I was hoping for 3 hours. i agree, though, nice viewing angle and quick re charge. perhaps it would do better on the power saver power plan. tough to have to compromise however."
3,ornella had better days,the cd is not bad at all. But some duets dont sound ok. The voices are confused and you dont know who is who.
2,Great projector for the price....until bulb goes.,"I am a teacher and purchased one of these for use in school. I like it so much, I bought another for home. A week after the second one arrived the bulb in the first blew. Three weeks later the bulb in the second unit went. I called Sharp and explained and shipped both in. They replaced the bulb in the first unit under the warranty, but the second they wouldn't replace since it was over 90 days. After much ""discussion"", they gave me the ""deal"" of a half price bulb ($150). I took it and now will hold my breath to see how long the new bulbs last. I treat these machines like babies, never bumping them, always use proper shutdown techniques, and regularly clean dust off fan grilles, but still lost both bulbs. The specs from Sharp say the bulb will last 2000-3000 hours. Not even close! Beware of this machine."
1,what a piece of s###,"For the love of God do not buy this garbage. I just ordered its second bulb that exploded at 24% of its so-called life the first bulb went at roughly 50%. I pampered the second bulb and kept it dust free and vacuumed.I always set it at economy setting instead of the regular setting which was supposed to prolong its life. What a joke and as for the dregs at Sharp they are rude, unhelpful and put you on permanent ignore. THEY DO NOT CARE AND THEY KNOW THE ITEM IS A P.O.S............all that being said it is too bad because the projector itself is really great when it works but the bulb is the single most important item and is junk."
2,Good picture short life.,I bought this product at Sam's Club for around $800.00. The picture is good. It was easy to set up. I projected this on a wall with good results. I have had this for about 1 and 1/2 years. This is located in a vacation condo and not used much. The bulb blew with 200 hours of use out of the promised 2000. I was disappointed. The new bulb cost about $300.
3,Go Swim all Strokes,I liked the video but I would of liked more specific details about the strokes. I have alot of questions that still are not answered.
5,Outstanding!!,"Donny Osmond has once again given the world a true gift. This CD is fantastic. His voice is incredible. You will have a hard time picking just one favorite song from this CD. Donny has combined his love of broadway, and outstanding talents and has created the best CD of the year!"
5,Awesome!,"Donny shows his vocal versatility on this CD. Having spent 6 years in the lead role of ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,"" Donny proves he can hold his own in the recording studio. His voice is amazing. Call him a former teen-idol if you'd like, but Donny is still going strong after a 38 year career. He loves to perform, and this CD proves that."
1,Price change?,"I was going to order this mat, but the price changed from 129.00 to 169.00 within the 5 minutes it took me to get my credit card- I don't think this is good business practice!"
3,Cindy,I first read this book over 30 years ago and if you like historical romances it is for you. I remember that I read it more than once and truly enjoyed the book.
1,Huh?,Is this guy kidding? My dogs sing better than this guy. I'll be selling (or trying to sell) this one on ebay.
2,It was Okay,"It was an okay book, but not one I would read again. I wasn't really impressed with the content and found myself relieved when I reached the end."
3,Backstreet Boys meets Ace of Base,"If you're considering this cd then it's probably because you (like me and many others) heard their track ""Around the World"" and/or ""My Heart Beats Like a Drum"". Beware, however, that there are many tracks on the album that are not done in the same style. Quite a few really sound like a cross between Ace of Base or Aqua and the Backstreet Boys. There are a number of slow songs and male vocals in the Backstreet style. In short, if you're buying this in hopes of getting an album full of tracks like the two you've heard on the radio or in the clubs, prepare to be disappointed. If you like Ace of Base or Aqua, and you don't mind Backstreet vocals too much, then you might enjoy this."
3,Euro-Cheese,"I liked ""Around The World"" enough to buy this CD. I liked the CD for a couple of reasons: the music isn't that bad, and it made me laugh a little. The first 2 songs, ""Around the World"" & ""My Heart Beats Like A Drum"" have instantly catchy choruses and they will swim in your head for days. A cheesy ballad follows, then we go to a mash of everything from the other songs. Some of the songs are laughable, such as ""Notte D'Amore Con Te"" and ""Until"" (the keyboards on that one crack me up!). Most of the songs are like the ballad above (cheesy), but in this case, that's a GOOD thing. Most of the lyrics are throwaway, but catchy, I bet a baby could memorize a chorus from any song after 2 listenings. A very enjoyable recording...and as cheesy as they wanna be."
5,This Is Great Stuff!! It's So Magical!,"Hey, if you like the hottest new single in america right now, ""around the world"" by ATC, then you'll love the rest of their album! They do a wonderful job of combining dance, pop, and ballads. This album has 14 tracks, 3 interludes, and 1 bonus remix! That makes it well worth the money! 5 of the tracks are ballads, while the remaining 9 are upbeat dance songs. It also has a 15 page booklet with the words to all the songs and tons of pictures! The boys and girls both sing quite a bit, so it provides variety in the songs. Check this group out, they are going to be the next big thing in america!!"
4,A gotta have,"This is one of those CDs you gotta have and then like three months later dont want. Its like a newer Ace Of Bace, but better. its a mix of the A.O.B and techno. Like half the songs have the same intro, but its cool, so no big deal. Although you probably wont like it that long, its definitly worth it just for the three months."
3,NO video cuts !!,Album has 8 cuts on it. Six are regular audio pieces and 2 are supposed to be video shorts. I have tried 4 different CD/DVD players and none of them will display the video cuts ! All you get are 6 audio cuts.
3,Exasperating,"I got two of these, one for the front and one for the back yard. The one in front is OK, but for some reason I just can't get the one in back to do a full 360 degree circle. I tried switching them, and tried turning the one in back around to face the other way, but it seems to have a mind of its own, and I still have to water half the back yard with a nozzle. Also, the screw on one came apart, and although I got it back together, it still leaks. I'm not sure how much of my trouble is non-mechanical me and how much is the sprinkler. But it seems these things shouldn't be so hard to figure out!"
4,"Naturalist's guide to Northern Canada and Greenland, not the European Arctic","This is a great handbook for the North American Arctic, and probably should be labeled as such. For Svalbard, or the Russian Arctic, not so much. SeeSpitsbergen: Svalbard, Franz Josef, Jan Mayen, 3rd: The Bradt Travel Guideinstead.The coverage is quite broad, meteorology, ice, wildlife, climate, the sea, and the plants are all discussed. From my limited knowledge and experience, I've seen no errors.With ongoing climate change, the Arctic is an increasingly important location with more visitors and renewed interest. This book serves well."
5,It does what its supposed to do.,"The cable arrive in an easy to open zip-lock bag, Brand name of the cable appears to be NSI / Made in China. Cable claims to be High Quality and High Speed USB 2.0 cable. I can verify that this cable supports both power and data connectivity, as I am using it to power my USB cooling pad with a built in hub for additional devices. Transfer rates seem fairly good. Cable seems to be made out of sturdy materials and the ends were in good shape. I encountered a couple small problems during the ordering process, but those were ultimately resolved by the seller with fairly good response times (<48 hours)."
3,Does Not Work on Intended Use,"The cables arrived in a timely fashion and were very reasonably priced. Bought them to connect my USB external drive to my notebook because it was longer than the cable that came with the external drive. The run must be too long and the power transmission too low - so it doesn't work. Instead, I must use the short cable that came with the drive. I have other uses for the longer cables, so not a problem and certainly not the cable manufacturer's/seller's fault."
2,Light weight,"I can say very much, lets very light weight. The picture makes it look like its a good heavy weight cord and its not. It would not be good for long period usage, or heavy data transfers. It did not work when I hooked up my two computers. It is well made, its only plus."
3,"Good book, but I wish I had more use for it","With the CISCO curriculum always changing, I feel like this book has fallen behind. Not the fault of the seller. However, I wish I was able to get a updated version."
1,Very poor book,"I can't believe Cisco would allow this book to be printed. It's as if the book was never reviewed by a technical editor. Their are a huge number of errors and the writing is clumsy. Unfortunately the online material is, in my opinion, not much better. Shame on Cisco for putting this out."
5,Great Product,I have had Alfi products before and I am pleased with them. This is the third one I have and I am happy with it.
5,Exactly what I wanted,"When I originally ordered the product it took longer than I had liked to arrive. When I confronted the Wunderli Family store they were very kind, and took care of the matter with the utmost intensity. This is a great company to do business with."
2,"Worth watching for interviews with veterans, but seriously flawed","Interviews with veterans are great but that is where the good news end. This is pop history with serious errors, incomplete research, inaccurate CGI, etc. Still, it is enough to spark interest and imagination so that's a plus. Watch it to get some perspective on the horrors of war from people who were there, but then do your own research.Another, rather annoying fact, is that the documentary literally repeats itself endlessly every 10-15 min or so, because it was designed for commercial breaks. So, multiple times during one episode, the screen goes blank momentarily (where the commercials would be) and then, immediately starts summarizing the entire episode up to that point, to allow for short span of an average viewer who must have ""forgot"" everything over the commercial break! So, there is actually a lot less material than the length of the episodes may lead you to believe."
3,"Not, bad, but not great","Interesting DVD - The battles were detailed and informational, but the animations were not as good as I expected, far below the quality of todays games and cgi movies. A few of the tanks were not dimensionally accurate, especially the M4 Sherman."
3,Nice printer but no support from Sony,"Nice quality prints and good features. Paper and ribbons are expensive and can be hard to find. Shipped drivers have problems with some usb cards, no newer drivers are available. In fact, there are NO drivers available for download from Sony's web site. They just don't seem to have any support online for this printer, period."
4,Great little photo printer,"If you want really great color and image sharpness and do not want anything larger than 4"" X 6"" prints, then this printer is a good choice. I've used it for about two years with no problems. I figured that if I ever wanted a larger print, like an 8"" X 10"", then I would have a lab do it. Sony does make the ink and paper for this--Look up ""Sony SVM-75LS""--it is available from Amazon, among other places. I have to say that the supplied ""Picture Gear Studio"" software is pretty awful. It is slow and not very user friendly. So that is why I give the printer a 4-star rating and not a 5-star rating."
5,Wonderful for students of World War II,"This book is so short, but very informative, beautifully written by a Christian survivor of the Holocaust and her experience of transport in a Nazi cattle car. This should be an award winning classic."
2,Colpac Review,The ColPac loses its cool too soon so we need to put it into our freezer often. Other sources of cooling last much longer (for less money)
4,FM calendar dissapointing,"I was so excited to receive this calendar, being an obsessed FM fan. I was so dissapointed in the pictures. There are 3 of each FM member, sans Cristine. The male members' pics were OK, but Stevie Nicks' pics were awful. They were all the same pose and the December pic was taken 'in motion' and is very foggy. There is no space to write in each day box,it's just for looks, NOT for writing information. So don't get excited when you see there's a FM calendar available, because you may be as dissapointed as I am!"
1,Didn't work on my NTSC player!,"Amazing Race (2002) Season 2I live in Australia, and have purchased many DVDs from Amazon (including the Amazing Race 1 and 2) and found this one did not work in my NTSC player at all. As I assume from one of the comments this one is burned, which I found out too late! But Amazon have been great about me returning them, and replacing just in case I had a bad one. I have had 3 copies so far and non have worked. Just a note for all AR fans, so you don't end up as disappointed as I was unable to watch!"
1,WON'T RUN IN OUR DVD PLAYER!!!,"These do NOT come as a ""boxed set"" as pictured. They almost look like bootleg copies (reminds me of stuff I've received off eBay before)!! AND they won't run in our newer DVD player!! They WILL run on computers and in our OLD DVD player - but not our newer one hooked to our flat screen TV with sound system. VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING and surprised to receive such a product from Amazon!!!"
1,The Worse Season Ever,"I've seen almost all The Amazing Race seasons but if I'd started with Season 2 I doubt I would have bothered with the following ones. The people in this Second episode were so blah and so boring and uninteresting, if I hadn't actually paid for this, I wouldn't have finished watching. I didn't care who won at the end. Yuck, yuck, yuck. Whoever picked these teams I bet picked no other teams in the following episodes. If you're thinking about buying this - save your money. Boring, boring, boring."
5,"Not SRV, but a very good album","If you like good, honest, blues-rock, good songs and excellent performances, this is an album to add to your stable. Just take a look at the performers: Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Susan Tedeschi, Jonny Lang, Dr. John (poignant song), Doyle Bramhall II, and the Double Trouble rhythm section of Tommy Shannon and Chris Layton, etc. This is just a good album. Great vocals and guitars."
3,Not Bad,"This is a pretty good collection of Beach Boys tunes, arranged for piano. It also has the guitar chords and fingering charts, which is nice. My only complaint is that some of the songs have been abridged horribly. The instrumental bridge from Please Let Me Wonder is missing, as are several sections of Good Vibrations. I was also disappointed that one of my favorite Beach Boys songs, Surf's Up, was not included. Otherwise it's a decent book, though."
5,One Outstanding Piece of Music!,"Absolutely fabulous! Peter Noonan captures true emotion in his music. From beginning to end, this work is a marvelous blend of highs and lows. You will want to play it over and over again! After hearing this CD, I immediately purchased all of his other works!"
1,Worthless for combining OTA-HDTV and Cable,I was hoping to merge my cable signal (not HDTV) with my Over the Air Antenna signal (HDTV). This item did not do that. Apparently most tuners require you to select either cable or OTA as your source before scanning for stations and the un-selected source channels come in as unwatchable crap. Seemed like a good idea at the time but in practice it proved to be totally worthless.
2,useless as combiner,"might be ok as splitter, but useless as combiner. should have paid $3 more and got a real combiner.drops signal too much when you use as combiner."
1,Tabs broke and didn't stay in,"Some reviews said this worked, others did not. I took the chance and ordered it. Within the first day one of the little push tabs on the side had fallen out and would not stay back in. It also wasn't consistent with staying in or thinking it was or was not a sync/charge cable. I got it because I wanted a long cable and it was, it just wasn't much more than that - a long piece of cable. I returned it and got a refund for the price, not the shipping. :("
3,I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY HIRED THAT FIYERO!,"The CD is great. Elphaba and Galinda have nice voices. If you want to have a karaoke night this would be perfect. The only reason you should not by this CD is if your favorite songs are the ones Fiyero sings. This Fiyero is AWFULLY TERRIBLY BAD! I had to skip Dancing Through Life because his voice bothered me so. It is like sitting in chorus class and the girl next to you can't sing to save her life, but she keeps singing louder and louder and louder until you want to scream GO HOME IF YOU CAN'T SING TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR WITHOUT MAKING MY EARS BLEED!"
2,Not Quite What I Expected,"This product is not quite what I expected. It's a low-grade production of the musical back-tracks from the musical, Wicked. The karaoke/accompany tracks are actually at a slower tempo than the music from the original soundtrack. The tempos often make the music very hard to sing to. In fact, the vocal talent has a hard time singing the music for the split-track CD to demonstrate the songs. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who seriously wants to perform this music and can find a piano accompanist to play the music. Although the back-tracks have all the instrumentation, its really hard to sing with."
1,Terrible,"I have to agree with the masses here...this is the worst background cd I have *ever* bought. I am a professional singer and vocal teacher and I perform with and use pocket songs and other instrumental tracks on a very regular basis. I also bought both this and the pocket songs version and while yes, I can appreciate variety and taking creative licenses, this took that way too far. It is admireable that they used real instruments, but only a select few were used and each stood out far too much. It is not easy to make me dislike *anything* that has to do with Wicked. I believe it is one of the best shows to appear on Broadway, but this did the trick. While the woman who sang Elphaba's songs was quite talented, she is really the only saving grace. Don't waste your money. The pocket songs version is by far superior (not to mention less expensive)"
2,"Ok, but very disappointing compare to alternatives...","I was really disappointed with this particular CD. I bought both this one and the Pocket Songs version (JT 325, which Amazon also sells), and although I listened to this one first, I was disappointed at first listen. The arrangements are clearly over-synthesized, and not even synthesized well. (Frankly, I probably could have created these arrangements on my own keyboard at home and done as well.) The tempos are spotty and certainly not up to the same tempo as the original versions, and the background vocals, while certainly are not terrible, are not the best representations of the original versions. My advice? Go with the Pocket Songs version. THAT version is done so well that I frequently get the karaoke and soundtrack versions mixed up when listening to the song intros."
2,Wicked Karaoke,"I was very disappointed in this cd. My daughter was using a few songs from Wicked for a talent show and had been listening to the original Broadway cd (which, by the way, is outstanding). When she tried singing with the karaoke cd, she was unable to because the timing is so different than that of the Broadway cd. Also, we listened to the cd with the vocals that was included with the set. It was horrible! I cringed at many of the vocals, which were not even close to being on key. If you need a karaoke cd of Wicked, I recommend that you wait until another one is released."
1,Not pleased,I wasn't really please. The music is slower than on other karaoke cd's I have listened to. I didn't really like it. I don't suggest getting this cd personaly.
5,Their best album yet.,Just try to listen to this in your car and not sing along. I dare you.This is their best album ever (and that's saying a lot considering the strength of their debut). The band has done a stellar job making older hymns fresh for the younger crowd. Love love love it!
5,Bought this for myself for Christmas!,"Ok, I know that's silly, but mom bought my the songbook, so I couldn't wait any longer. She and I love to sing together, hymns, mostly, but now I get to introduce two of my favorite people(s). My very spiritually 67 yr old mother to my FAVORITE group. (crying)I've never got to see Jars in person, and now my health is not so great. But they have, unwittingly, helped my faith so many times. I lost the love of my life in '99, and Jars was there. So was mom. Now you see? I lost my son in 2000, and guess what, they were there, and so was mom. Now, we get the two- through God's grace together, wow. Mom is a mezzo-soprano,I sing Contralto. But we mix it up.(smiles) I hope mom is around a long time. And I sure hope Jars is too. But if we could meet face to face, Mom would adopt every one of those guys. I'm sure of it. God bless you."
4,Yummy!,"I finally got to use it along with a new recipie for corn sticks. I followed the cast iron products instructions & it worked just fine. The recipie I used was cut in half & was just enough for 6. Thanks to Amazon.com for carrying these products, by the way they are easy to clean."
2,Cute Idea but not worth the trouble,"We've got two of these and must say that while cute as the dickens conceptually, they aren't worth the time. First of all, the corn image doesn't come out clearly. Secondly, they are difficult to clean after the first few times. Thirdly, you would need three to fit the corn mix of two Jiffy Cornbread boxes (which is mostly what we make.)Now, if these facts don't set you back and you are still interested in purchasing this product, let me tell you that THE best way of getting the best corn kernel image is to coat the bottom with Crisco -- all veggie version please. You have your heart's health to maintain. We tried various versions of spray oil (ie, regular Pam, Pam-like spray with Flour, Grilling Pam) and the Crisco butter-flavored sticks worked best.Pam T~mom/blogger"
5,Continued education,"Being a pilot for 20 years, it was as if I a door had opened with explanations for questions that never to be answered."
4,Understanding flying,"Having just started the pilot course, I got the advice to buy this book. Though I was surprised that it'd been authored a long time ago, it's written in a very comprehensible and enjoyable way. I didn't read it yet just skimmed through it but I look forward the free time to do that. I would recommend it to anybody who is excited about piloting."
4,xbox component cable,If you have a HD TV and want HD graphics from your Xbox you'll want this cable. Also you can stream HD content from Netflix.
3,substandard packaging,"The cable is exactly what it claims to be, I guess. I honestly dont see a difference. The packaging was underwhelming - plastic wrap with no documentation, no information, nothing. Didnt point out that there is a switch on the side to change from regular to HD - not that I could see a difference. Maybe if I watched movies on my xbox through netflix or something I would see it."
3,"Supposed to be new, but was obviously used.","My Prime order was fulfilled by Springledge Entertainment. The cable arrived on time but was obviously used and shrink-wrapped. No original packaging, and there was dirt on the connector. A little disappointing, but for $10 as long as the cable works I'm not going to get too worked up. I do wish Amazon cleared up new vs. used with their vendors though."
5,Great,I would recommend for anyone to use this cables. the coloring isnt perfectly clear but it works perfect. Nice :)
4,haven't gotten to use it yet,"It came from the seller quickly, but it wasn't what my husband thought he needed. His fault, not the seller's."
1,Cheap Knock-Off and not genuine Microsoft cable,"Bottom line, product page is a complete lie as it is NOT a genuine Microsoft Cable but a cheap knock-off. Amazon return policy on this is also a 1 star as I have to wait up to 2 - 3 weeks for a refund for this cheap crap."
2,Why buy this cable?,"I bought this cable to hook up my newly ordered Xbox 360 to my HD TV. But I later found that the 360 comes with a very similar, if not identical, cable. Perhaps one is longer? Perhaps this is an out-dated accessory? Whatever. Check your 360 before ordering this cable, or end up feeling dull and foolish like me."
1,Broken,"I bought this component cable, and it came to be appearing to have been cut with scissors, so that the wiring inside the rubber was visible, and frayed. Complete waste of money."
5,great service,Everything went very smoothly. I was notified at each step of the transaction and given contact information if I had any questions. I received the product before I anticipated it and it was in great condition. I am extremely satisfied and would definitely buy from them again.
1,"Not the same, not impressed","I bought this cable and what should be the same cable at walmart, to compare, and this for sure isnt the same cable, not the same quality. The xbox is hooked up to a 50 inch DLP tv and there was a noticeable difference."
5,Genuine Microsoft Product With Microsoft Hologram Sticker,I don't know how Amazon is able to sell this much cheaper than everyone else but I ordered one January of 2011 and it arrived with the Microsoft logo embossed and with the Microsoft Hologram sticker to indicate it's an authentic Microsoft product. Everything works as expected and looks to be of good durable construction.
5,Good Product,The cable was just as described and works perfectly. I am glad I didnt pay[..] or more for a new one.
3,Fair quality,"These component HD cables are horrible compared to HDMI. Either my tv is horrible or the cable i received was messed up.I tested these component cables vs HDMI running @ 720p from my 360 to my HDTV and i can see a notable difference between the quality!The HDMI has a more clear and sharp image, while the component has more of a pixelated and blurry image.My suggestion, if your tv has an HDMI input and your xbox has an HDMI output, then search ""HDMI cable"" in amazon and buy the $2 HDMI cables, they are so much better than component cables.However, if you cant support HDMI, then you are stuck with these so-called ""HD"" cables. (Although they are still better than a 480i normal av signal.)"
4,OK but embarassing,This was a gift for my school teacher wife (middle school of course). Thougth we laughed at home she has not dared take it out at school. She's afraid that it would trigger a chain reaction.It sounds ok and has no smell.
4,awesome mask so far!!!!,"I bought this mask not too long ago, and to be honest, this is my first paintball mask. The quality is pretty good, no problem with the lens, one downside is that its kind of tight, couldn't adjust to make it loose more, that's why i give it 4 stars :)"
1,Horrible!!!!,It is not the full mask it claimes to be in the description!!!! It is only a standard mask!!!!
1,Not all that powerfull...,"I have had this sub for well over 2 years now, and I can safely say that I was underwhelmed from the moment I listened to it. The bass is boomy and uncontrolled. The rattling the other reviewer heard was most likely the sub un-loaded and bottoming out while trying to reproduce really low frequency notes (Anything under 35hz really. This thing sucks.) All in all, very unimpressed."
2,not what i expected,"I can hardly even smell anything, I put it in the dryer, but did not smell a fragrance. Not worth the price."
3,"Not too bad, just listen with an open mind","Sadly, a lot of Queen fans just don't have an open mind (like the other reviewer on this page who I doubt has even heard this album.)I just got the CD today and really, it's not too bad. My favorites were ""It's A Hard Life"" which reminded me of Nine Inch Nails' cover of ""Get Down Make Love"". While the song has been completely reworked, it still retains Freddie's lyrical intent.""Under Pressure"" is almost trance-like. VERY relaxing stuff, very pleasent to listen to.""We Are the Champions"" comes off more like KMFDM which is kinda cool.Anyway, if you're an OPEN MINDED Queen fan who enjoys or would be interested in listening to the band's music done in a completely new fashion, give ""Queen of Rock"" a try."
4,Easy to Follow,"I gave this book only four stars as it was a little to basic for me. This was the only reason!There is lots of valuable information and it is very easy to follow the instructions to get the desired results/effects. Some things I had already learned either on my own, from another book, or from a two day Photoshop CS2 class I took.Would recommend to beginners or maybe beginner/intermediate looking to expand with fast tips.I bought ""Hacking Photoshop CS2"" use off of Ebay, Amazon has them new, but this book really paid for itself just in the first chapter of tweaking the Photoshop preferences, etc. Starts up noticiably faster on my laptop now! Would recommend that book highly for intermediates and up."
4,My little boy is very pleased!,"My son loves this toy. He enjoys the different noises that it makes and the splat of light that shoots out. I like that there are no annoying suction darts lying all around the house (like the ones that come with the Nerf shooters). It seems pretty durable -- my son has only had it for about 2 months, but he is pretty rough on his toys and has broken things in a matter of minutes. Being that it's a gun, I hardly think it's at all educational but it makes my son happy and there is a dial that let's you alter the sound. It also would have been cooler if it shot out more than just one color."
2,did not help reception.,the unit in question drove my tuner into overdrive; resulting in many stations appearing on same frequencies. wish there was a gain control.
5,All thumbs up!,"Filibusters' The Means absolutely BOSS!Everyone should listen closely to these incredibly, talented unique band men. They should have already been accepting awards by now, if not notariety for their exceptional tunes. Classic best describes the talent, A ""must buy"". I look forward to a top of the charts cd soon! EVERYBODY CHECK IT! Way boss- to die for. Peace, love and Filibuster!"
5,makes my life look pretty good,this is a great read. start to finish it flows very well. will's humorous vignetes get better as you continue. this book serves as a great reminder on how bad things can get and let's you appreciate the small things in life
2,Too much Mamet not enough Chekhov,"In readng this play adapted by David Mamet, it is a stark differenc e from the original Chekhov. Mamet takes out whole scenes and modernizes them far beyond recognition. I ordered this for a school class and it was not helpful.Thanks."
5,Grill indoors,"I was looking for a way to grill indoors and was not satisfied with electric models.This two-sided griddle is great, fitting perfectly over any double gas burner. The cast iron construction conducts heat well, although there are some hot spots directly over the burners.Both sides have a fat runoff that work well. This model does not come preseasoned, but it's a quick task. Once done, food never sticks and comes out as if it were grilled on an outdoor grill.It is heavy, but I like it better than the lighter pre-seasoned version also made by this manufacturer."
4,A nice collection of American war essays from several eras,"I enjoyed this collection. There were pieces from various wars in which America participated and the perspectives were well presented. There's no attempt to write history here -- merely a sample of the times and conditions as they were from the Civil War to the Gulf. An easy read and one that packed enjoyment. If you're looking for serious analysis of strategy and tactics, there are better places. If you want to consider the thoughts and reflections of some human charcaters in combat, this is a good spot to start. It was especilaly nice for those of us who commute by public transit, with bite-sized pieces to easily digest in a short time span. Since these are each individual essays, there are a few repetitions from story to story, but on the whole, it was pleasant and informative."
1,History writ simple,"geez, Ambrose can really churn it out, can't he? What we have here appears to be a collection of sweepings from Ambrose's floor; stuff he couldn't fit into other books or just had lying around. Well, this mish-mash certainly didn't do it for me; though I *did* laugh a lot at his D-day essay in which he first decides to have a go at scaling one of the cliffs only to ""chicken out,"" and then instead dons his swimmies to go for a paddle in the channel in order better to empathize with the lot of the average GI climbing the beach under fire. Apparently, the water was quite choppy. Give me a break!!"
1,OH MY GOD!HELP!,"This has got to be the worst CD I have ever heard in my whole entire life!!Don't blame Madonna though......This is not her fault! I am pretty sure madonna would be [angry] that a piece of Garbage like this is out on sale for the public. This ""Otto"" person who released this cd, just wanted to make money off of madonna. You can't hardly hear madonna, only on Tarck 5. What a waste of money!!!warning: stay away from this cd!..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!,"This is mislabled, it should be under ""Otto Von Wernherr"" NOT Madonna! I have NEVER heard music this bad before. If I were Madonna I would force them to take her name off the CD! If you have not heard these ""songs"" consider yourself lucky! I am not sure I will ever get over the trama! It gets 0 stars out of 5 in my book!"
1,WARNING: This is NOT Madonna's work! It is Otto von Wernherr,"Only 3 of these songs are actual recordings in which MAdonna voluntarilyy provided backing vocals, but they're nothing to scream about anyway. The other 7 tracks (I WILL NOT call them ""songs""!) are just tracks done by otto using Madonna's chopped up vocals from the original 3 tracks. For example, Madonna's vocal line in ""Wild Dancing"" in which she sings ""I'm looking for some wild dancing out on the street"", is used to make up a track called ""On The Street"" in which MAdonna is heard singing ""dancing--dancing--out on the street, out on the street"". Not worth your money! Not even if you're just curious"
1,not good,"nothing like the madonna we have seen come through the years.i think she should have left this stuff buried in the basement. i have no problem waiting for new music from her. seems like she is being lazy and wanted ""anything"" out to keep her popular. these songs are all bad... and like i said, think she should have taken her time and released ""quality"" music."
1,What the hell is this?????,"I am not a fan of Madonna but I bought this album out of curiosity because I liked her album ""Confessions On A Dance Floor"", and how is this the early years? Example: ""Wild Dancing"" (which is a great song Btw) AND ""On The Street"" are THE EXACT SAME SONG!!!!!!!! On WD, Madonna sings ""I'm Looking For Some Wild Dancing Out On Thew Street"". On ""On The Street"", that line is sampled so the chours is ""Dancing, Dancing, on the street. On The street."" What the hell? This was so awful that even my cat was ready to kill herself unless I turned it off. Oh and the rest is just sound clips being sampled together to form So-Called ""Songs"". Not to mention ""Give it to me"" is just her singing ""give it to me"" a bajillion times. I thought Virtual Eleven by Iron Maiden, my favorite band, was the worst CD ever, but this makes that looks like a masterpiece..."
5,Scars (cicatrises) can be healed,"This was a great movie and I would recommend buying it. I would recommend this movie to any couple whose relationship is not what it once was. It shows that with compassion and forgiveness and with God's guidance, relationships, marriages can be restored. Annette Moreno's voice and songs are beautiful in this movie. It is well worth watching and you will want to share it with others."
1,Yuk,"This film was definitly aimed at the under 20 crowd.... so unless you like rap and poor acting,don't waste your money. I tried to watch it all the way through to get a better understanding about what the younger crowd was into.... but I couldn't. It drove me nuts. Gonna donate it to the library."
1,One of the worst historical books.,"Really people, giving 5 stars to this. Are you kidding me. This goes for the Spring of the Ram too."
2,too heavy,This flatware set is very heavy and the spoons are very shallow. My three year old doesn't like them. Waste of money. My daughter prefers her Oneida flatware set.
5,Works awesome,"kit was full and complete. works awesome, supports 240+ pounds... then my girlfriend kicks me off it. Good buy for fathers who don't hug their daughters, she will be using it in the future."
3,should i buy?,hey my name is brittney and i want to buy this but i dont know how good it works? I am 170 and im scared its going to break. Can i have help please?
4,A Must Read for Business Students,"Definitely a must read for business students and maybe marketing managers. Although I wouldn't call it the ""bible"" of the business world because as you'll notice, some of the concepts are clearly outdated. Nonetheless, Porter introduces strategies that as a basis, still are highly functional today, even in our high tech world. I particularly enjoy reading his predictions on product life cycles and theories about strategy and performance (p.159). Porter also introduces other important strategies on lowest cost, differentiation, and focus. These bring structure to the task of strategic positioning. He shows how competitive advantage can be defined in terms of relative cost and relative prices, linking it directly to profitability, and presents a whole new perspective on how profit is created and divided. I work in marketing and have found his strategic concepts highly relevant."
2,An unpleasent surprise,"I've heard about this book and Michael Porter for a long time; the people I have talked to absolutelly adore him and his writings, but I must say I was througly and repeatedly disappointed in this book. The strategy itself is - without a doubt - a brilliant approach to strategic management but as a piece of writing all I can say is: Dull, dull and dull!"
4,Seminal Work,"Competitive Strategy is one of the seminal works on strategic planning. Written thirty years ago, Michael Porter's insights hold true today and form the basis for almost all the developments in the field since the books publication. Anyone involved in the development of business strategy will find this a helpful and insightful reference book."
4,good but not great,"I bought these after reading reviews .I don't think they sound as good as some said they did.However I am satisfied with them for what I use them for ,background music on patio.For the money I didn't expect Bose quality."
2,Good point,"I agree very much with Peter LaPrade's review. I liked the general message of this story and that it's written from the horse's point of view, but I found that it went on and on about the same thing and was too slow. Anna Sewel's Black Beauty is 10 times more gripping and is also told from the horse's point of view. Written for adults - Black Beauty should be read by anyone who considers themselves ""animal lovers""."
2,"Fair to good, but not very good","Tough to find good copies of this one. This was advestised as ""very good."" At best, it's possibly good (for a well used book) but more likely only fair."
4,Wanted it right away!,"I, like several other reviewers, was struck by the soundtrack at the very beginning of the film. The final piece from the opera convinced me to go buy it right after seeing the movie. Hauntingly beautiful, yet eerie as well. I'll be listening to this one for a long, long time! Ta-ta!!"
5,Answer to Richard's Guide Bearing Concern,"First, I have this saw and love it. Can't say enough good about from the Amazon price, to the Amazon delivery, the ease of set up, to the performance of the saw. I also strongly recommend the Powermatic mobile base and riser kit for this saw; both are great.However, I write mainly to answer one ""concern/complaint"" expressed by another reviewer above. He states that there is no way to adjust the side bearing on the roller guides. This is incorrect. There is a set screw that you loosen with an allen wrench. The side bearing are on an eccentric axis. You merely use the same allen wrench to turn the screws holding the bearings on and by virture of the eccentric axis you are able to move them closer or further from the blade. It's much easier to do than describe. In short, you can adjust both upper and lower side bearings to be as close or far from the blade as you like."
2,Assembly Instructions,The instructions to assemble the saw were among the worst I have ever seen. Steps were missing so that once a certain point in the assembly was reached you had to take it apart again to complete the missing step. This happened 4 different times. The photography showing most steps was poor at best. I wound of with extra parts that I still have been unable to determine what they were used for. I assume the extra parts are from another missing step in the instructions.
4,It is a good book for beginners and students,"I really enjoyed this book because the supporting theory was included. Many SSPS books are guides of the menu system, and this book avoided that tendency. It does lack an explanation of ANOVA repeated measures and block designs. But for basic statistics, its fine."
4,DAE JANG GEUM VOL 3,"Excellent story line. Very captivating. This is one of the best drama series I have ever seen. The only reason I did not rate it a 5 was due to the English sub-titles being somewhat hard to understand. But I realize it is difficult to get a good dynamic equivalent translation sometimes. Congratulations to the producers, cast and crew of the excellent Korean Drama series. I also have Vol 1 and 2 and really enjoyed them."
1,If there was a -1 this movie gets it!,"Ok, the people who gave this 5 stars, what illegal drug were you on? If you can enjoy a movie where a little man lives with a tree and floats around in a X-mas bulb most of the movie, then trust me you must be on some type of drug.... I am serious people, I never would advocate drugs but you would have to be high to actually like this movie. Don't waste your time.. unless you enjoy a man, a tree and X-mas bulb rolled into a movie...."
3,Weird ... but interesting,"Any trailers you watch will not be a good summary, but I guess that's the case with trailers in general.I got the movie for a few reasons: a) heard some of the music on Spotify and liked it; b) the trailers certainly made it look intriguing - a love story through the ages; and c) I like both Rachel Weiss and Hugh JackmanIt's an unsurprising New Age mixture of religions - Christianity, Buddhism, Reincarnation. As a Christian myself, and having watched the trailers, I wasn't really surprised by this.The story, for me, lacked resolution. There was an implied resolution, I suppose.(SPOILER ALERT) As best I could determine, and with my admittedly limited knowledge of Buddhism, it appears that Nirvana is finally achieved near the end. But it was vague enough that I couldn't be sure what, if any, resolution there was."
2,They lost me,"It's not that I didn't like it... I just didn't understand it. The movie is like a beautiful and intriguing puzzle, but the trouble is that in the end the pieces never actually fall together to form a bigger picture. Which ultimately leaves the viewer confused, unsatisfied and sort of empty. The performances by Jackman and Weisz are absolutely wonderful, and the visuals are stunning. But apart from that... It just didn't do it for me. I need a STORY. The Fountain gives us tidbits, but no involved storyline or in-depth character development. Besides, I feel somewhat cheated... The way the previews misrepresent this film is almost criminal. They make it seem as thought this is The Highlander plus depth and minus the action, the story of a man who is living forever and trying to save his dying wife over and over and over. This is NOT what it's about. Not even close."
5,Mind expanding,"This film will stretch peoples' minds to the infinite - beyond the mundane and limited viewpoints that we currently percieve, to a timeless level where all life is one, and universal love pervades all. Watch it with patience, humility, and a clear open mind, and you'll be well rewarded."
2,The Fountain,Interesting at first ! Then gets too far fetched into a freeky fiction kid of flick . I give 2 stars due to its off the wall path of strangeness.
1,Almost as bad as AI,"Is there any way to give this movie an infinite number of negative stars? Although the acting was superb, this is an extremely boring movie with little to no quality. Definately not worth watching once, especially not 5 times as at least one reviewer has done."
1,Terrible!! Waste of time!!,"I usually like ""wierd"", different movies. However, this one was terrible. Both my wife and I agreed that we wasted 1-1/2 hours."
1,Huh?,"Huh?No seriously, huh? I suppose you need to be wasted to get this one, but I'll leave that to others to try."
4,Different,"It's interesting to read the reviews on here. Everyone seems to have seen something in their own way. I'm sure I'm no different. I kept thinking about how much it reminded me of a stage play. It was different, deep, and gave an interesting perspective. I enjoyed the movie but I also enjoy movies like MI3 or other ""dumb"" hollywood movies as someone said. Go to the movies to be entertained not to look for the meaning of life. Especially since you are seeing basically one person's view (the director) and probably shouldn't take it too seriously to begin with."
1,worthless waste of time,this reminds me of another worthless waste of time called 2001 a space odyssey. it had no real plot or storyline. the only part based in reality is that people die. if you want to get the same message from life and save yourself an hour and a half then listen close......people die! now that you know that secret you don't have to sit through the agony that is this movie.P.s. it is unlikely that you really would have taken that message from this movie if you hadn't also gone searching online halfway through the movie to find out if this movie had any sort of point or might possibly get better at the end.P.p.s. it doesn't get any better at the end.
3,Hmmm....,"....well, I was watching a lot of movies the week I received this. But I have to say I usually remember a movie if I liked it a lot.I can't remember anything but having turned it on with great anticipation. I think the imagery was cool but there's this word my wife and I use: ""resonate"" which just did not apply to this movie.I'll probably watch it again sometime to see if I feel any differently about it, but for now, it's just an average movie."
1,WARNING: DENDROPHILIA,"A film in which Hugh Jackman makes love to a tree.No, seriously. He actually makes love to a tree."
2,Seriously?,I love Hugh Jackman and he does a very good job telling the story. The problem is it beats the message into your head repeatedly. Now... if you are slow to figure things out. Great trippy little flick.
2,Very confusing story line.,"Very confusing story line, which never quite came together for me at the end. The two other adults who watched it with me had the same experience..."
1,I dropped the F-bomb at the end of the movie,"My wife wanted to watch a romantic comedy, and I wanted to watch a Sci-Fi, so I did a quick Amazon search and found this ""Sci-Fi Romance"", BINGO!For the whole movie, I was waiting for some Transformer Decepticons or TARDIS to appear, but they never came. There's not even a surprise ending or twist like ""Bruce Willis is a ghost all along""!As for the romance part, I guess it's just an average sad love story, reminds me of ""What dreams may come"", which is equally crap.Right at the end, when the credits came up, I couldn't help it but to say ""Oh F---!"" I then immediately read the five star reviews of this movie, and realized the movie is made for the Starbucks, Fine-Arts, student-loans crowd.I now need to watch some Avengers to get this movie out of my mind."
2,Do some drugs first,"This movie is clearly a great example of why I stay away from ""art-house"" theaters. Another reviewer said ""if you want a linear plot, blah, blah, blah"". If I wanted to experience a brain-bending psycho-trip I would just drop some acid (but I don't, so I didn't). The movie has plenty of good special effects but the pace is really slow and the acting does not carry it through (over, past?) the overly abstract story line. If you decide youi like this movie, good for you. Most people won't make it past the first 20 minutes. My recommendation is to not waste your time, unless your time isn't worth much."
1,I really tried to like it -- but it just SUCKED!,"I was very excited about a new Hugh Jackman film -- the trailer looked like a great adventure. Boy was that wrong. This was a slow, depressing, vague, boring movie -- Hugh should have run from this one. The only redeeming quality was some of the cinematography. I watched it but I won't watch it again."
2,beautiful but boring,"The direction, costumes, and acting are all wonderful in this movie. The problem is that the script is an awful mess. I wanted to like it, I really wanted to like it, but beauty will only carry it so far. I left the theater disappointed.Strange as it sounds, I think it might have been better if the director would have stuck with images and dropped the story. A kind of dream sequence of these images would have been much better. Then I would have been able to enjoy what I was seeing. This script is more amaturish than profound."
5,Darren Aronofsky masterpiece,"One of the best movies that I've seen in a very long time. Hugh Jackman's performance is absolutely brilliant; let me put it this way, this movie made me cry and that's not something that easily happens. For movies like this there's not adequate words to praise enough, I'll just say this, go and buy this movie."
4,THE FOUNTAIN,"Beautiful film, but very bizarre. Jackman and Weitz are fantastic as usual, but the story is very strange. It oscilates between three different story lines that converge. It's a tribute to the director and the talent that this works at all. I had read that Brad Pitt had been slated to star it this film, but that he had to bow out because of the long pre production, though im sure Pitt would have done and interesting turn in this role, I really can't imagine anybody but Jackman making this metaphysical script work: thanks Brad for following Angella all over Africa and letting the role fall by default to the singular Jackman. I recommend this movie, but watch it with an open mind, you may learn something..imagine that."
3,What'd I miss...?,"I admred Aranofsky's Requiem for a Dream, and was expecting to be blown away by The Fountain, but it only left me baffled. Certainly, it's gorgeous to look at, and the past and present episodes were quite good, but the future segment totally escaped me. Clint Mansell's score won awards, but I thought the new-age sound was quite unexceptional and repetitive. The cast was fine, especially Rachel Weisz, and the brief but effective appearance of Ellen Burstyn. Hugh Jackman handled his very complicated roles admirably. I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. The DVD extras provide some insight that the production was plagued by shut-downs and delays. With budget cuts and other hang-ups, I'm sure the result isn't the film that Mr. Aronofsky set out to make."
3,Love and Hate,"Darren Aronofsy's made a great love story! The visuals were beautiful, and it was full of emotion. But you really had to think hard to try to follow what was happening in the film. Granted the story was easy, but the fantasy sequences needed to be explained a little bit better. He didn't quit explain clearly if Hugh Jackman's character was really in the future or had he really been in the past. At one point I thought he was just tripping on something! I love fantasy, but I also love movies that flow and this had a few bumps in the road."
1,If there was a negative star to give I would give it!,"Worst movie since ""Zardoz"". Sure the visuals were pretty but ""Sunrise Earth"" on Discovery HD has more substance than this. The thinly veiled ""point"", point not plot, was heavy handed, narcissistic, and trite. At no point were the characters believable and always incredibly selfish, i.e. screw saving humanity I want to save the one woman I love. People call this movie a poem, perhaps but not a very good one. I'm more of a fan of Keats than Milton though. If you want an incredibly long ""Paradise Lost"", then this may be for you. If brevity is the soul of wit, this movie is witless. By the end of the movie I felt like I had lived forever."
1,Too bad,I thought it was all a bit boring. I enjoy 'deep thought' but this was just a bit of a drag for me.
1,The REAL Truth,"One day I decided to buy a FORD truck. Before I made up my mind, I decided to get all the informaion I could. I wanted to get all the details from someone who really knew what they were talking about and not just tell me what I wanted to hear just so they could make a buck. So where did I go for the information--to my local CHEVY dealer. I figured they should be unbiased and be able to quote former Ford presidents about their trucks without loosing any context or clarity. Sounds pretty outragous doesn't it? Of course, an intelligent human would go to the Ford dealer to find out about Ford trucks. Then when that person finds the true facts from the proper authority, that individual can make a knowledgable and wise decision for ones own self. This book is like asking the Chevy dealer about a Ford truck! Don't waste your time or money, go to the true source!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!,I bought this item X2 for my vacation home. They did not last even two weeks before they started to come apart at the seams. Nobody who used it was more that 160 pounds in weight.It is a shoddy product that is not fit for use as described. In the UK it could have been returned as not fit for the purpose for which it is sold.I purchased it around one month prior to my stay in USA and can not now return it due to Amazon 30 day return policy. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!
1,Ostrich Beach Chaise really suck!,"Bought for vacation and within days rips and damage (bought just for laying on at beach, no crazy stuff). I would have been ok with lasting only the season but less than one week? Never again."
5,Inexpensive and appear to be good quality,"Hoses are very well made and appear to be high quality. Changed out all the lines on my hydroboost system and these are far better than the Gates brand that I previously had on my truck. They are inexpensive, but well worth it. Some of them come with protective sheathing to protect the hose in areas where it might contact other parts in the engine compartment, which is something most others dont come with, so thats a nice little extra."
5,The Best,Wonderful book aimed at the recipients of the Silver Cross. Excellent biographies of the men. Great photos and printed on high quality glossy paper. Great reading.
1,Messed up,"This book is skewed and not true.It is clear that the author was writing it only to interest catholic members and make money.I am amazed that he was able to get such a false documentation published.Mr. Bennett should be ashamed of himself. He makes it sound like the Mormons are completely trying to trick everyone.I have had a few mormon friends, and they have told me a little about their church. They disagreed witht this book.From now on, I am going to the real sources to get my information. Not from a man attempting to exploit his position to make money, without truly representing the subject.I definitely would NOT recommend this book."
2,"Pretty, Unique, but...","I really searched on-line for something nicer than the ""office""-type carafes out there. This seemed like a good product. However, condensation forms between the lining and the outer layer... a lot! Maybe other carafes do this, too, but you just can't see it since this product has a ""see-thru"" outer shell. But taking it apart to clean it is not enjoyable. Plus, doing so, we cracked the inner lining slightly so now, of course, our tea doesn't stay warm very long. Also, the top opening is very small and difficult to pour into. Pretty, but not functional in the long run. (Our ""thermos"" brand lasted years.)"
3,it was an okay starter,I bought this sewing machine for my daugter for Christmas. We tried it out and had a few problemw with the bobbin. You have to be sure you thread the machine properly or it will not work. My daughter is 9 and enjoys sewing with this machine. The only trouble is threading the darn thing.
4,lightweight sewing machine,"This sewing machine is fine for my purpose in buying it - a lightweight machine to use for small sewing tasks when visiting my father. I need to repair seams, re-hem, other little jobs that I have been doing by hand on my visits. I don't think I'd try to make a whole new garment - the machine is very light (which was the point for me in buying it) and a little rickety, but for an experienced seamstress it's usable and useful for repair jobs."
1,Broke,We bought three of these machines for a classroom quilt project. They were so poorly made that I am returning all three to buy ONE machine that costs a little more. You are much better off going with a more expensive machine- this one is very cheap in every sense of the word.
3,not bad for under $40,"It took me 20 minutes to set up the machine and thread the bobbin and needle; the instruction booklet and pictures were excellent. I had no problem sewing a decent stitch on the sample thin piece of cloth they provided on my 1st try (I'm a novice), but had considerably more difficulty trying to hem a pair of twill jeans. Possible issues: (1) material may have been too thick, and I was trying to stitch 3 layers together (2) you have to go fairly slow or it won't put down a stitch, (3) tension issues? So it's not perfect, but given that having pants hemmed in my town costs $15+, this is what I needed. Given what I've read of the other $100 machines, I'm not sure they're any better -- if you want something better, I'm guessing you have to go up to $150 or $200."
2,Sew{rp,"Worked great for a while but then, for some reason, the tension started to cause the tread to break all the time even though I never changed it. I tried to fix this and couldn't. It would probably cost as much to have professionally fixed as I paid for it. Don't waste your money here. Too bad since it was good at first."
3,Good for the price,"This is a good little sewing machine for simple projects. It's very easy to use. There are some issues with it though...I personally don't like that it has a plastic presser foot, it doesn't hold the fabric securely enough. Also, it does take a bit of effort to maintain straight stitching. I find that top stitching can be difficult and I don't like that the ""long stitch"" isn't very long at all. It's a very basic machine and would be good for beginners, but once you really know how to sew, you'll want something more sophisticated."
5,back in a daze,it took me back to a time in my life when life was like take life by the horns and dance like no tomorrow
4,Well satisfied,"I purchased this in preparation for our upcoming trip to Rome. Upon review, it is exactly what we need."
2,Misrepresented,"The item is advertised as having a powerful 6.5HP engine, but what arrived at my door was a 6HP lawn mower with a mediocre engine. For small lawns this is probably a great product, but for large lawns I would not recommend it, especially since you can find a comparable item at your local big-box store for a little less. If shipping were not such a problem in my area I would have returned it. However, I do not feel ""ripped off"" but simply that I did not make the best selection I could have for the amount of money I spent."
3,"Neocate Overpriced, but a necessity","Neocate is the only thing my allergic child can drink, however this is an outrageous price. You can find it for about $120 with free shipping directly from the Neocate website, and they always have promotional codes, so do a search before you order. I sure hope your baby outgrows their allergies soon. My little one is 2yrs old and still very dependent on Neocate. Good luck."
3,"Writing is fine, not sold on the main character","I read the Hunter because I really enjoyed Payback with Mel Gibson, and the newest movie reminded me of it (haven't seen the newest movie yet). I didn't really care for Parker in this book. I didn't sympathize with him or particularly root for him to survive in the end. I've heard good things about the series, so I will still read The Man with the Get Away Face, but not because I think The Hunter justified it.The positives are that Stark (Westlake) does a good job of keeping the story moving. It doesn't bog down or take too long to accomplish any of its points. Also, it's interesting to get a glimpse into how technology, cultural, and other factors have changed how this story unfolds since it was written in the early 60s."
4,Xbox Live,"Can't really say much about this, because it's basically a new subscription. It's good for the price because it's expired. The game itself, Bankshot Billiards I believe, is definitely not one the best but it's entertaining. The headset is brand new and the design's different than the one that came with my xbox."
2,Nothing special.....,"Audrey Finnegan is a temporary secretary that Wheeler Rush hires when his business is going under and his regular staff are gone. She is supremely accident-prone but means well. Over the first two weeks Wheeler realizes that she is his ""good-luck charm"". What she lacks in secretarial skills she makes up for in personality- she wins back old clients and has connections that bring in new ones.After this Wheeler suddenly realizes that Audrey means something to him but he can't quite figure it out. Duh. You'll have to read the rest of the story to find out what happens.This story had its cute moments but to me it was a slow read. I felt the characters lacked depth and it was mediocre. It would be alright if you don't have anything else to read but I can't recommend it."
2,pretty whack,"I heard the song one beer and thought it was great and I got this album based on that one song. Well, the rest of the songs are pretty whack and besides that one great song the beats are pretty lame and doom can be a pretty boring mc at times. He has the ability to make these great songs but is very inconsistent with both rhymes and beats. The hip hop i mostly listen to is wutang and kool keith."
5,mmm... delicious,"for the record, its daniel dumile.. theres no use tryin to explain how good this album is cause if you know about DOOM and enjoy his creations (lyrical and producing) as much as i do then you already have this album and all his other work from as far back as KMD (RIP subroc) or his appearance on ""gas face"" by 3rd bass.with that being said, DOOM better keep up the pace with droping these records (as he's droped atleast 3 this year alone) or i'll die of starvation. mm..food is just another classic meal cooked up by the villain that has underground heads everywhere eating it up. if you dont enjoy MF DOOMs work and what hes all about, you must be clouded by the crap that fills radio waves. you either love'm or dont know him yet.. where do you stand?"
2,Good price but not so good quality,"I bought these cds a lot of time ago and I remember that I lost 5 cds because of problems in the burning process (10% of Cds was lost).The quality of this CDs is not very good. The upside surface is very vulnerable and you can even scratch it easily only by touching at it. You can easily remove the surface completely! The result is going to be an unusable transparent CD.Many of these discs are right now a waste because of the problems with the surface and hardly will buy cds from this manufacturer again. Though, I understand, it's a good price.Please be aware of the quality."
4,Great Costume!,"I purchased this costume for this past Halloween and I totally enjoyed wearing it. Everyone thought it was cute and fit me so well. All the accesories where included with the costume, the only thing I needed to purchase were the shoes. The price was also a plus because I was on a serious bugdet."
5,Mike's In Constant Motion,"This DVD is a must to own. Anyone who has followed his work with DT and his many other side projects will find this DVD very fulfilling. Not only does he devote an entire disk to his work with DT he also devotes another entire disk to his playing with Transatlantic, OSI (one of my personal favorites), Fates Warning and others. I was not disappointed watching the incredible constant motion displayed in each of the songs he chose to include. No doubt Mike is probably one of the best drummer's alive today. The third disk I have not gotten to yet, but I am looking forward to watching it. Mike is an extremely intelligent dude and I find it interesting listening to his stories and his commentary on the music. My only complaint is the price of the DVD. I feel that it should be priced around 30 dollars. However, I am still satisfied with my purchase and I know that I really got my money's worth."
1,Riser block problem still not fixed - 2009,"I got my Powermatic saw today and started to set it up. I thought I'd install the riser at the same time since I already had all of my tools out. The riser I got is out of square; not only does it cause the wheels to be misaligned in the vertical plane, but the top and bottom surfaces of the riser block are not even parallel. When installed, the top of the saw leans back enough to be obvious. putting a straight-edge across the face of the top wheel shows that the bottom wheel is set back a half inch at the top and three quarters at the bottom, so re-drilling guide holes wont even cure it; one of the horizontal faces would need re-milled. Nice Q.C. there, guys. Hopefully, I can get a good one cross shipped without a lot of blather about how co-planarity(sp?) is overrated. I'll let you know how this tragicomedy ends."
5,Strong Women Strong Bones,I ha recommended this book to many people and bought it as gifts. i faithfully do the exercises and follow the menus. I even showed it to my dr. It is wonderful for those of us who are older and even the younger since I bought it for my daughter-in-law
5,"Dance Disco, Maxed","Love every minute of the tunes. The music the movie, what a time in our life...baby-boomers forever!!"
5,Death of Innocence,"As a young girl, family members told me the story of the lynching of Emmett Louis Till. I was also told stories of the ""ways"" of the Old South and the deep-rooted hatred whites had toward Blacks. When I was young, I saw the gruesome photos of his maimed and distorted face in Jet magazine. I was horrified. Finally, I was able to read a story about Emmett's life, his brutal murder, the trial and the aftermath of it all from his mother. Mamie Till Mobley's account of her son and family is inspiring. I felt her pain. I also admired her courage and resolve. Emmett's death had a powerful impact on the world."
4,Blues from the Heart,"I ran across Catfish Hodge at a local club awhile back and he put on an outstanding one-man show. You could tell this blues man was feeling every note he played and every word he sang. As the show went on it became very evident that he was telling you the story of his life with each original song. As soon as I got home from the show I bought this CD. It was originally released in 1979 and also has 6 bonus tracks from an earlier released CD: BOUT WITH THE BLUES. The CD is hard hitting and full of all the emotion of his live show. The track ""Cold, Cold"" will freeze your blood. I played it over and over, increasing the volume a little louder each time! The last song, ""Can I Go Home"" seems to sum up much of the sadness Catfish has felt in his life, and talked about at the show. Many of the tracks also have a 70's funky blues sound that is rather interesting and reminds me of R.L. Burnside's recent releases. I am surprised that more blues lovers are not talking about Catfish Hodge."
3,Healing Promises,"This book was okay. Copland's book, Faith to Faith, is however much better as it is a daily inspirational book. This book, on the other hand, was, I thought, a little disfunctionally organized, and appeared to be put together in a hurry. On the up side, it dealt with the WORD which makes it worth reading as the WORD HEALS regardless as to how it is presented!"
5,Boyfriend Loved it,I purchased this faceplate for my boyfriend for a Christmas stocking stuffer..he loved it. It fits well and looks very attractive. It gives your xbox a more mature look that compliments your decor a little better.
4,Good,"Well I got it in the mail and popped it on the 360 and worked awesome.The only reason I rated it overall 4 stars is because of the wireless connect button. When I pushed it just once very lightly, it broke off and is now not there anymore."
2,Just Ok,"Track 1 is the best on the CD, lively, good flute, good travelin music. Need more stuff like this. CD is faily short as well, probably 30 minutes."
2,As an introduction it is a failure,"The title is misleading since the book is an uninspired collection of articles. The concept used for in the arrangementof the various chapters is poor. This is a cheap way to get published. This review is not intended as a general overview overthe quality of the specific articles concerned which are, as they stand, in general interesting or even good. It is only that the editor has done a bad job in his choice and (noncoherent) compilation of material."
3,Almost as described,"I knew I was buying a used monitor and that it would have some cosmetic blemishes, but there is a slight defect or damage on the display itself. It's not bad enough for me to take the time to return it and find another one, but I do see a couple of ""blotches"" on the screen every time I am using this monitor."
2,Not well made,The stitching came out of this toy in at least 3 places in the first 2 days that my daughter had this toy! She is extremely gentle with it so it is not due to mis use. The wand cover also came undone in the first night she touched it! My daughter had a different bear from this line for 5 years and it never fell apart! I would not recommend this for anyone who was not simply going to put it on a shelf!!
2,AHHHH No.,"I'm surprised at how many people actually find Smoosh 5 star worthy. I had read about them several times, and finally decided to do some listening. Chloe's drumming is well-done, and so is Asya's keyboarding. But both of these instrumentals almost completely cover the vocals, which sound like a child in a local talent show, displaying her ""skills."" It's the kind of voice I could head over to the middle school, and hear any pre-teen sing with. Child prodigy? I'm thinking...NOT."
1,She Like Electric,I bought this CD for my daughter who is 10 yrs old. She really didn't care for it much. I wouldn't recommend this CD.
4,saw them live,"dont expect a highly polished overly produced hillary duff type sound. but they have originality, real creativity, quirk and charm. this is indie pop made by middle school kids, to all those who complained, i'd like to see u try to make something better. i think some songs r better than others thats y its a 4 star rating, but they really get a lot of bang outta a drum set and keyboards. they play pretty flawlessly live. and from the preview of new songs, the next cd will show some growth."
1,Why not Smush?!!!,"I can't believe that smoosh even has a CD and people actually buy it!!! It''s horrible!!! When they sing( if that's what they are doing) it sounds like they are dying!!! I don't get how they are even singers with a contract!!! Who would pay them for what they do? They should be called Smush! If you want to listen to young-ish singers, that have good voices, pick up a copy of ""Into The Rush"" Aly & A.J's CD."
4,Smokin' Mellow tracks,"I heard this song at a club and picked up a copy at a local record store. It is a nice dance ""song"" with flavors for the club, radio, and various regions of the country. Its like Melody C or Sonique with full vocals and song structure which is just what radio needs right now. I heard they are getting ready to release a new set of mixes which I hope they make available on CD. The hottest mixes for now are the original and Mhz's... worth to checking out."
5,YardMan Push Mower,"I bought this push mower with the purpose of cutting around my 1 acre fish pond. A grass trimmer does a good job, but it throws too much grass clippings into the water. With the grass catcher installed, I couldn't believe how much grass clippings & leaves this mower collected in the rear bag - it like a vacuum. The Yard-Man mower I bought is basically the same as this one, except with 14"" rear wheels (high wheel version)Pros: Easy Starting, light Weight, Pushes Forward Easy, PriceCons: Not as easy to roll backwards because of rear flap guard."
2,strange book,"This is a really strange book. I`m an expat with a bank in Tokyo so I wanted to read this book as soon as I heard about it. But it was a big disappointment. I know Lehman did some crooked stuff, but where are the really juicy details? Why did the author make us read so much about his time at Yale Law School and other experiences that have nothing to do with the book`s title? And a lot of the book seems like a personal vendetta against people that the author worked with at Lehman."
1,For big children only,"This is an encyclopedia no different from any other, so I was disappointed when I bought this for my kindergarten daughter. I expected it to be less on information and more on ease, it wasnt. It may be fine for older children and young adults."
1,Not for turbo applications,I used this to make some custom gaskets that are not available from the manufacturer and they did not last. They dried up/cracked and fell apart. This was between the turbo/ex manifold and also the discharge flange and exhaust.
3,Not What it Looks Like,"I ordered 3 of the lavender masks as gifts. When I received them I was slightly disappointed. They do not have the nose section cut out as shown, they are just rectangles, which you can get anywhere. And the packaging is cheesy. It looks as if I got them at a flea market or the dollar store. I'm returning them, I can't give these as gifts this holiday."
1,motocross zombies from hell,"I rate this move a big fat ""0"". I bought this movie because my whole family is into motocross and I thought there might be some good racing footage. To my utter horror, this was a poorly made (looked homemade) in my opinion soft porn, terribly acted piece of garbage. We turned the move off after about three minutes and disposed of the movie in the trash . What a waste of hard earned money. There should be some kind of warning to go along with the movie description, so no one gets ripped off like I did."
1,A review from Zombie-Nation!,"I am going to forego my regular review format, as I find that it isn't necessary.Just know that this movie is one of the BIGGEST pieces of crap to have ever graced a DVD. There simply is NO reason to watch this movie. Everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) about this movie is complete and utter garbage. An insult to the genre. Even the director / writer was embarrassed by it and only used his initials. You would be better off to just stare at a blank t.v. screen for 102 minutes. Seriously.Amazon needs to seriously consider adding a ""No Stars"" option."
2,fritz chess,"I thought it would do more to teach me. I enjoy playing chess, but have no one to pla y with. I am a novice player and need to learn so much more. Fritz was at best so so."
4,"If you need to know what GAAP is, then buy this book.","This book is really the best place to find out what GAAP is today. It's perfect for CFO's, Controllers, Accountants and students of accounting. It provides a lot of excellent examples to help you understand how to apply GAAP within your own company. Everyone else may find it a little dry.This book is a great resource for creating accounting policies for your organization but it won't help you with procedures. There are a lot of other good books for developing procedures and this is not one of them.It's a great reference text for everything you wanted to know about GAAP, financial statements and accounting. If you need to know what GAAP is, then buy this book."
5,Hidden Gem of the Early 90s,"This CD is too good not to have more reviews. I first heard ""Gone for Sure"" on an alt rock station in Albuquerque NM in 1990. I had to drive 20 miles to a pay phone to call the station for the name of the band. Since then, ""Wide Eyed and Dreaming"" has been a staple in my CD collection. The songs are a mix of full, guitar based indie rock to piano, horn-based ballads. The songs are fairly timeless and as relevant now as they were 20 years ago. Some have hints of the twangy alt-country sound that is so pervasive now in acts like Tim Easton, Ryan Adams, etc. Makes me wonder if Sea Stories might have been a little ahead of their time. Give this a shot. If you were into alternative, progressive rock in the 80's-90's (especially the kind that didn't shy away from the slide guitar) - you won't be disappointed."
2,high $ for low torque,I was hoping to find this item with either a lower price for its torque or higher torque for its price.
4,good product-good price,"follow instructions and it will do what it says it will do . i use it to steam clean wood and ceramic floors , bath room and kitchen counter top. i like the attachments for the various jobs."
1,Not a wise purchase,"It looked so good on TV, but it didn't clean any better than Windex. Be careful in the bathtub as it will melt caulking!"
5,Steam cleaner for sanded grout,"Works well for the price. Still needs a little elbow grease, We used it on a sanded grout tile floor. Try putting grout cleaner on the grout and letting it sit for 15 minutes, then blast it with steam and wipe with clean rag."
1,Not as advertised,"Returned the product. After reading the reviews and the propaganda I picked the Steamfast. I had high expectations of cleaning small areas around the house without using any chemical substances.The first area was the garage floor. There was some oil and rust stains. After prepping the unit as instructed, the unit only spitted out a low volume of steam and at very low pressure. Quickly it wouldout of steam and had to recycle more steam. What a major disappointment! I had so many projects lined up like tile grout, car wheels, etc.I will try another brand."
5,SteamFast SF-275,"Excellent product. It was recommended to us by a family menber; the device works great for getting into hard to reach places. We are cleaning a rental property, and the job was accomplished faster, and the property is more hygenic after using the device; expecially the bathrooms and kitchen. It is easy to use, and to clean up after use.When using the SteamFast, keep a towel / paper towels handy as you need to wipe up the excess water left by the steam."
5,Works well for wooden floors - effortless,"I have been using this unit for around 12 months and it is reliable, generates ample steam, and cleans wooden floors and bathroom floor tiles effortlessly. I will never go back to chemical cleaners, this unit is so much faster and requires less muscle power.Once in a while the steam stops, this is due to the hose twisting. I use an extension cord to complete the job in my 2 bedroom unit.In my experience the accessories are not useful. I tried it to remove shower scum (didn't work well), it was easier to simply use elbow grease with a mild cleaner and scrub."
4,Shipping issues,the first unit arrived in terrible condition. It was not securred to the pallet and the crating was not designed to ship something of this weight. Amazon went above and beyond when it came to replacing the unit. I received the second unit with less damage but still not an up to standard shipping crate. This time Amazon sent the replacement parts and the unit is a hungry working monster. I love it. A little rust on one of the infeed conveyors. Amazon is king when it comes to something of this size. I was nervous ordering machinery of this magnitude. I would and will buy from Amazon again.
3,A bit disappointing,"I had high hopes for this resource. I was disappointed. It is supposed to help you find related passages for any particular passage or ""theme."" In my experience I rarely found this to be the case. Many times I would go to the cross referenced text and have to scratch my head wondering what it had to do with the theme it was listed under. A much more helpful resource for this type of study is the ""New Treasury of Scripture Knowledge."" While most people won't want to lug this hefty volume around, it does provide a seemingly exhaustive list of cross-references for every thought of every verse in the Bible. I recommend keeping your existing Bible, or buying a simple reference Bible, and get the TSK instead of the ""NIV Thematic Reference Bible."""
5,Guys need a good book and video to read,"Guys need a good book and video to read. This is a great video series, book, help chane my life. Read Wild at Heart 1st both are great. Big John Elredge fan."
4,My parents love it!,"I bought a pair of these for my folks on their anniversary. They're sturdy, natural-looking, and are comfortable to kick back in. Assembly is pretty easy, although not all that fast, and they do occasionally have splinters. Once it's weathered a bit, though, they are great to lounge in and birdwatch or read or just enjoy the sun."
5,REALMENTE BUENO,"DESPUES DE AÑOS DE HACER BUENA MUSICA CON EL ""ULTIMO DE LA FILA"", MANOLO GARCIA NOS REGALA UN DISCO DONDE NO EXISTE UNA SOLA CANCION QUE NO VALGA LA PENA. EXCELENTE."
4,A Very Pleased Reader,This book is interesting and is full of surprises.Here is what it is about. Olivia Jones is a mom who is going to work with a woman named Natalie Seebring. Olivia thinks that Natalie lives a good life. But Olivia is brought in to assist Natalie in a Memoir Olivia fines out her life is not so easy.This book is a complex one yet it is one of the best books of the summer. This is a must read!
3,"Material is great, readers not so much","I had high hopes for this based on Dr. Seuss The Cat in the Hat and Other Favorites. That set is absolutely wonderful with amazing voice talent. These readers, however, aren't as good, but that makes sense since the actors used (David Hyde Pierce, Jason Alexander, Michael McKean) while entertaining on tv, don't compare talent-wise to Dustin Hoffman, Walter Matthau, John Lithgow, Billy Crystal, etc.My advice is to pass on this set and get the other. If you already have it and your kids want more Seuss, be prepared that this set isn't as good."
1,Intel=Crap,This computer is wayyyy over rated. My 2.0 GHZ iMac G5 is just as fast as it is even though the intel had better and faster RAM. Frankly intel=crap and PowerPC=great.
2,Marketed on Rep Not on Product,"This machine has a lot of bells and whistles but they don't always work nearly as well as advertised. The biggest problem I have with it is that it freezes and has to be restarted at least once every day and often 2-3 times daily. Apple used their reputation for building superior computers to sell a product that absolutely doesn't live up to its reputation. I wouldn't mind so much but for $1350 I expected a lot more. Next time I'll buy a Dell for $400. Even though they are as problematic, I will save $950."
5,Quality utensil,"Excellent ladle - no drips when serving. Good size for soup, short pastas. Very pleased."
1,You'll never understand this book!,"I recently bought the Glenn Neely book, to see what all the fuss was about.Wow, who's got the Rosetta Stone to translate this thing from Nonsense into English?I salute anyone who can make heads or tails out of a single page of it. I scored 2220 on the GRE, and after 2 readings, I have no clue WHAT he's talking about.I'm not convinced chapter 3 was actually written in English -- more like translated INTO english from french, by someone who flunked french! Think stereo instructions, written by someone who'd never seen a stereo.Anyway, if you're tempted to buy this book, FIRST have your library borrow it thru inter-library loan. It's available that way."
2,Expect more from Clark's,"These shoes are very attactive for casual pumps. However, they pinch the sides of my feet, even when I'm sitting. These shoes are OK to wear for short periods of time, but do not live up the the ""comfort shoe"" reputation that I expect from the Clark's lines."
5,"Macbook air 13""","Fits perfect for my macbook air 13"". works excellent to polish the screen. A+ product, would buy radtech products again for any laptop i own"
5,This item is the BEST,"This is the best laptop companion hands-down... it is great at cleaning scuffs off of laptop screens , keeping the screen safe if kept between screen and keyboard of laptop., and also very good at cleaning the ""shiny and scuffed"" keys, just add water... quite literally.. Would HIGHLY recommend."
3,Not bad but I have keyboard marks on my screen,"Does the job, but I see keyboard marks on my screen from dust or whatever it is. So it's not super great."
4,can't not have one of these,"I don't know how anyone can own laptops and not have one of these. It keeps the screen clean, although you have to make sure to wash it (machine washable) every so often. Also, it's good for cleaning your screen every now and then. I just with they sold these cheaper. $14 for a piece of cloth. :("
1,Earns the name PANIC!,"I bought this product for my cat. She loved it so much when the first one broke I went out and got her another one.However, I hope my story makes you aware of this product. My cat was playing with the panic mouse 360 when all of a sudden she let out an extremely loud meow. She jumped up on my bed pulling the heavy toy behind her! A wire loop goes through the mouse and the loop had loosened and became wrapped around her paw and tightened as she tried to become loose! As she was running around in a panic I was trying to catch and free her, she eventually broke the wire part off the wand, but the wire was still wrapped around her paw.Thankfully I was able to get her and take the wire off, but she was extremely frightened and hid under the table.This product is CHEAP and potentially HARMFUL to your pet's health. It certainly earned the name PANIC mouse! DO NOT BUY!"
3,This is an excellent book describing the courage and perils of those Germans who settled in Russia prior to 1900.,"The book was in less than perfect condition, but then it was used. The dust cover was missing and the previous owner's name and phone number are written on the inside coner. There is some underlining. I'd borrowed a copy of this book from the library before ordering and am pleased that I was able to find a copy. It's worth a read, not only because it is an excellent portrayal of the history of the immigrants, but also because it reveals a surprising weakness of one of our national heros, who played into the hands of the tyrant, Stalin. Stalin's viscious behavior is no surprise, but Eisenhower's cowardice is."
4,Well made and it looks good!,Have only had this bath pillow for a little over a month and so am not sure how it will hold up - hence the 4 star rating. If looks are anything to go by I think that this bath pillow will last a lot longer than previous ones that I have purchased from local stores. It's very comfortable with just the right amount of 'give'. So far no problems with the suction pads. Would definitely recommend.
2,Suction cups are not workng,"Suction cups are not good at all. I bought this product because of the review posted for it, but in my experience is not as good at it could be."
1,Don't bother,"I didn't know much about Janis but got interested in her a few years ago when a friend turned me onto her music. AFter reading Sweet Scars of Paradise, and Love, Janis, I picked up a copy of Buried Alive and was really turned off and frankly, disappointed, by the author's self-righteous tone. This book seems really outdated with its psychoanalytic slant and negative portrayal of Janis. Seems like the author had a personal vendetta against her and the entire '60s.If you're looking for a good book about Janis, I'd bypass this one and read the others bios instead."
3,Great for Starters,This dictionary is great if you want a little pocket size Igbo dictionary. I like the fact that it has a very handy and useful phrasebook in the back. This would be very useful for anyone that is traveling to Igboland. The dictionary is not a complete dictionary and does not have all Igbo and English words. Nevertheless it is great. I would recommend it.
2,There is room for improvement,"This book is a welcome addition to a very scanty body of work about the Igbo language. The grammar and pronunciation are very well explained, there are good illustrative examples, and the phrasebook is extensive and useful. There is also interesting material about the Igbo history and culture.However, the included dictionary gives no guidance about the tones used in pronouncing the words it defines. Words are NOT marked for tone in the dictionary. Since tone is phonemic in Igbo (as in Chinese, for instance) this is a very serious limitation and it prevents the reader from building up a vocabulary by browsing the dictionary and plugging new words into sentences introduced in the phrasebook and grammar sections. If there was a lot of other material available for learning Igbo one wouldn't need to use the dictionary this way, but there really isn't.Hopefully in a future edition the authors will rectify this sin of omission."
4,spin study,"A fascinating documentary about how US networks and especially Al Jazeera, the satellite cable channel watched by 40 million people in the Middle East (it started only in 1996), have covered the current Iraq war. In the first few moments of the film Samir Khader, a producer for Al Jazeera, observes, ""there is no war without propaganda."" This film gives the lie to the common idea, constantly repeated by Rumsfeld, that Al Jazeera lies and distorts the truth whereas US media are fair and objective."
3,"Good Photos, A lot of errors","Bob Dorr is a friend of mine and I respect his work, but there are a lot of errors in the text and captions in this book. The one good thing about it is that there are a lot of photographs. But don't expect to learn a lot about the details of the Vietnam War. It's worth the price for the photos alone but without them I'd give it a two.Sam McGowanVietnam Veteran and author of ""The Cave,"" a novel of the Vietnam War."
4,Sublime,"I am a big fan of poetry and this book did not disappoint me. I live in Australia, and therefore am not exposed to what is au courant in the US anymore [originally from the US]. I saw Kay Ryan on the Lehrer Report which is broadcast over here. She was reading from this book, and I decided to buy a copy.The poems are earthy and touch places of the heart that elicit a sigh of recognition. It is good to read poetry that is open, uncoded and taps into our everyday experiences with such elegant simplicity."
5,Amanda's Review on: ALICE IN APRIL,Alice in April is a really a good book.Alice is about to turn 13 and her dad and her Aunt Sally say that she going to be Woman of the House.Her mom died when she was little.As woman of the house Alice think that her dad and her brother Lester should go get a Physical.IF you want to know more about the book READ IT. Amanda S.-14
3,Pretty but few charms,"Mr. Angel is clearly lifting his voice to the Lord, and I respect that, but his songwriting is kind of weak. He has a lovely voice, and he uses it well, but the material leaves a great deal to be desired. The final song, a duet with a gorgeous soprano, is the reason I bought this album and I still can't get enough of it, but the rest of the album is quite bland."
1,Like a singing refrigerator,"My impression of this album is that Ryland Angel knows everything about singing and nothing of what he is singing about. The stacked harmonies of his background overdubs are amazing, but his lead vocals are stiff, stiff, stiff. Take Broken Heart for example: ""When you had left I stood, I was broken inside. It was if you were slowing down the beat of my heart."" No, I'm sorry, but this just comes across as descriptive text for the emotionally impaired. What he should be singing is ""When you left, you ripped my heart out!""Each word is perfectly shaped (by far the best ""was"" I have ever heard), but the meaning of the words and the arc of the melody never make it off the printed sheet. These songs are like refrigerator magnet poetry; each word unconnected with the larger whole. Just move the magnets around and Ryland sings another sequence of pretty notes."
2,Terribly let down,"I love this author. I was mad about her previous books (well, Killing Critics was so so). Imagine how amazed I was to actually give this ""The worst book I've read this summer"" award. It was so trite and flat. Don't bother buying it, you can have my copy."
1,my order didn't arrive!,"It's hard to review something that didn't arrive. I will not be buying from this seller again. I have waited for almost three weeks for my book, and I am still waiting for a response to my e-mail.This is the first time I have had this happen from any bookseller at Amazon,"
3,By the end of the book -- who cared anymore?,"I had such high hopes for this book -- I love Mallory and Charles and all of the characters. I even like magic so I wasn't put off by the subject of the book. However, it took so long to get to there that by the end of the book, I didn't even care any more who the murderer was. The writing was drawn out and at times, boring.I still like The Man Who Cast Two Shadows the best of all the Mallory books."
3,Not bad for so cheap...,"Works well at keeping my phone from getting dinged. I was excpeting a little more quality from stitching to sealing, however. I needed to trim the clear vinyl with some scissors before I could actually get to my power button."
2,Not really focused on new moms,"As a mom of a 3 month old I found the workout itself decent though not very specialized for new moms. Its a very basic workout, nothing new to be found here. I wish she would show actual mothers with babies doing the workout as she uses the medicine ball to demonstrate throughout. There is little to no instruction on proper form and I question some of the ab work for a new mother, there is a lot of twisting and crunches which i don't think a ""new"" mother should be doing as it could lead to worsening diastasis. There are much better videos out there. I suggest Erin Obriens Postnatal Workout."
4,Not A Pottery Wheel,"Folks, this isn't a pottery wheel. It is a banding wheel used for pottery, but for decorating or for sculpting to make it easier to turn your piece while working on it. If you are looking for a pottery wheel google it. You'll end up spending a few hundred dollars though, so if it is priced at say less than $30 it isn't going to be a pottery wheel."
5,Great bra's,I finally found a wonderful bra and also a place that has them. I will keep ordering as long as they carry the bra as the company is totally functional. Wonderful place to shop.Thank you
2,It's ok,"The first turret in my life, so I can't really compare it to others, but I don't like how it leaks onto my hand and how I can either press the lever to get full pressure, OR use arrest the lever, but don't get full pressure.----------A few months later:The turret is now spraying water all over me when I push the lever. I guess I'll get a new and different one next year."
2,Very disappointing,"I got this book because I loved Anya Seton's Katherine. Let me tell you I had a hard time finishing it, I kept thinking it's got to get better, but it didn't. If you want my advice buy Katherine not Avalon."
5,Fun & light-hearted,"My daughter is two, and she really enjoyed this book. Did she understand it? Perhaps not; but she loved all the animals, especially Share the Lion. Cheerful illustrations, and yet underneath it all an important message. This book fills a tremendous gap in our children's literature in that it is a fun and light-hearted look at the ways in which we understand or misunderstand both people and events. For conscientous parents who are neither moralistic nor trendy. This charming book deals with problem solving in an innovative way."
5,Outback Rocks!,"This is a must for every Survivor fan out there. Probably the best season ever, with its ""Baywatch"" cast and memorable moments. It even includes the mid-season recap and the back from the outback episodes. It's fun re-living the moments where:Rodger gives Elisabeth the heart-shaped stone;Colby throwing a bucket of water at Jerri after losing the picnic reward challenge;Tina salvaging the rice when the river came flooding the the Barrmundi camp;Kimmi's moment of glory when she finally took a bath;Mad dog's takes off her false teeth at the food challenge;The little jacuzzi at Kucha;Kimmi and Alicia fighting over the chickens.It sure is worth watching over and over again!"
5,The bottom line for managing your business.,"This book gives managers a new way to look at their businesses, a way that benefits talented employees,company owners and yes, even customers! When businesses learn to evaluate all of their economic alternatives in terms of what their investments cost them, they can and will lower the delivered cost of product to their customers and create more wealth for their employees and owners at the same time. It is so refreshing to find someone who understands that rewarding talent in your organization benefits all stakeholders. As a strategic planning consultant, I recommend this book to all of my clients. EVA is THE PATHWAY to surviving and thriving in a globally competitive economy."
4,Unique,"I got this as a present for someone who can't keep a hammer. This is unique enough that he can pick it out form a distance and say ""Hey, that's my mutant hammer""."
5,great item,great item. have not used it and bought one for buddy. we are die hard tool collectors and usere so this was a great item to garage.
5,Wild Rose,"Excellent! Rose O'Neale Greenhow was an extraordinary woman, a master mind as a secret agent. Her life, which was obtaining intelligence from the North for the benefit of the Southern government, was extremely intricate. Great reading, not a dull moment in the book!"
2,Great Britain's transportation systems planning.,"While the book may have a great deal of useful information regarding transportation planning, it is written about Great Britain's roads and other public transport and so has limited utility in a non-British transportation context. Formulas are in kilometers, designs are for left-hand driving, etc."
1,overall a rather bland documentary on ancient greece with some good scenery,"want a real good documentary on ancient greece? - look elsewhere.yes, you may learn a few things about ancient greece by watching this - but altogether it was just kind of humdrum and threadbare on content. it is not that there is no great CGI, (and there isn't - great computer graphics do NOT make a good documentary - really don't care about that). and besides being threadbare on content the narration was filled with platitudes and the music i found to be either depressing or bombastic. mostly depressing. again, not much here. sorry i got it - off to my local 'movie stop' store to trade it in!"
4,Ancient Greece Discovered,A very good historical documentary. I was particularly interested in the coverage of the Santorini volcanic explosion 3 thousand years ago. Greece has a long and proud heritage and this DVD would make you feel proud to be Greek.
3,"Cute, but inelaborate.","Neil Simon's 'Lost in Yonkers' will more than likely appeal to casual and mainstream readers of dramatic literature. Its characters are cute & satisfactory at best, but they are underdeveloped, and the lacklustre ending left me wanting more from the play. If this were the first Neil Simon play that I ever read, then I probably wouldn't read him again unless I really needed some fluff."
2,Where was it made?,"Before you buy, be sure to check where the pen was made. I have a number of older Cross pens that say ""USA"" near the top, and they are great pens. However, I have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made, and they are of inferior quality. The top and bottom halves are loose, and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap. The first one I got, I sent it back to Cross for warranty repair under their ""lifetime guarantee,"" only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a ""handling fee"" attached.I was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly, one bad pen. So later on when these new colors came out, I bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect.My advice: if you want a good Cross pen, go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in USA. They aren't making them the same anymore."
5,Punk and pop merged to perfection,"The first time I heard the Buzzcocks, I was stunned at how underrated they are compared to bands like the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, and the Clash. John Maher was punk rock's best drummer (check out ""I Don't Know What to Do With My Life"" and ""Orgasm Addict""), and Pete Shelley wrote songs that were far more emotionally complex than anything the Sex Pistols ever did. Basically, the Buzzcocks single-handedly pushed open a door that made it possible for many post-punk British bands to exist...they are simply the first English band to merge the classic 3-minute pop song with the speed and aggression of punk. Unlike the Ramones, the Buzzcocks experimented more, but they never stopped writing songs that were witty, masterful, and tuneful. Great music, and this is a great CD to start with."
2,Not enough specifics on campsites,"This book is padded with a good deal of idle talk and goes-without-saying ""tips"" but not enough solid facts about the actual campsites. I'd like to see better directions than""north of the city"" as well as phone numbers and pricing ranges for the campsites. There is some useful info, but it is sparse."
4,Dark fantasy,"I will confess I was drawn to this book by the interesting play in the title. It would not have been my normal reading fare, but, I will also confess that, once I got into it, I enjoyed the story. Good read for a long trip by train or plane."
1,"A vast bore, a picture of a degenerate society",A bunch of social parasites feed and drink and dawdle while others less lucky are at the front fighting the Germans. Why would anybody waste his/her time on this depiction of degeneracy?
4,fun and hard,My son had so much fun playing this game. After getting past a few boards the gets hard. Still very fun game for both kids and adults.
4,Really helpful to have on hand,This has been a life-saver for me in my first weeks of my online Master's programme. Really up to date - I was impressed to see that they include how to reference YouTube videos and Facebook. The only one that's missing is how to reference a Kindle book!Worth it for anyone who has to write academic papers using the Harvard method of referencing.
1,Bad buy,"This hat was too small, looked cheap, and completely unusable! I was very disappointed when I anxiously received it in the mail."
2,basic info,"nothing new, nothing excitingbasic nutrition info presented in a slightly different manner"
1,Do not buy,"I bought 2 of these and one of them was completely dead! I mean; a new product!!! how can this be possible!!??.(update (10/1/2011) the second one I got stopped working after 6 months of use. I wasted ~$35 on these poorly made products, please buy something else with that."
1,dont waste your timer,"I purchase two timers and returned one dead on arrival while waiting on the replacement the other timer led stopped functioning, I have returned both timers once and received timers that do not function as they should....these timers are a P.O.S. avoid unless you like spending your own money returning garbage"
1,Worthless,"Don't waste your time and money on this product. It wouldn't even turn on to activate any timer settings. Either product was defective, or a scam!"
1,"Unfortunately, defective","Despite reading the negative reviews of other buyers, I decided to chance it thinking if it worked, I'd be golden. Bad choice, b/c now I have to return it. After plugging it in, I programmed it just fine, and the battery charged up. But then... I plugged it in again, and this time got all the LCD elements lit up and none of the buttons were working. Unplug it, and it seemed to work again, but that's no good, b/c then stuff plugged into it wouldn't work!Worse yet was when I gently rocked it while plugged in and heard the relay clicking on and off. That was the sign that this one was toast.The sad thing is that feature-wise, this is a nice unit; they just need to get their quality control up."
2,Hard to set up!,I played with this thing for over an hour last night and still do not have the timer working!! The instructions make it sound easy but it's not!
4,Flexible and good for the money,"For the money this is a great little unit, but it's a little confusing to program. The 3 prong is a nice feature. For some reason our backup battery did not work. The battery is good. It does a lot for the little price tag. Just wish someone would rewrite the programing instructions. One star off for the backup battery feature not working and the lack of straight forward programing instructions."
5,Great product works as advertised!,I use this timer to control all my low voltage landscaping lights. This product is very easy to program - I did not need to read enclosed instructions to figure this timer out and had it completely programmed in less than 5 minutes. I reprogram this timer - several times a year - based on changing sunrise and sunset times for my landscaping lights. My 300 watt landscape transformer has an internal outlet where my Woods Timer is plugged into .... then my transformer internal power cord gets plugged into the timer. Did I mention that this is running all OUTDOORS ... albeit housed inside my landscaping transformer.I am very satisfied with this product and it works flawlessly for me. I don't see any real downside or Cons to this product. I'll submit a picture later for my application of this timer.
1,"Junk for Jerks, from China","Two units had one dead and one showing all numbers at once, hence non-readable, within 5-6 weeks of purchase. Classic ""Junk for Jerks, from China"". At least I didn't get lead poisoning!"
1,very poor experience,"I bought this timer in Sep 2009 to repace a mechanical timer I had used for years.I set the timer up according to the meager instructions and used it twice in four months.In April 2010 I went to use it again and it was not functional. It would work on the standby battery, but when plugged: in the display was ""all 8s"" and could not be set nor would it work properly. I wound up using one of my 20 year old mechanical timers again. This is not worth the money. I do have two of the single outlet Woods Digital timers, purchased at the same time, and they are still working"
3,handy digital timer,"Setting up the timer was a bit tedious, but once I got all the steps figured out, it was not that difficult. I suggest you first familiarize yourself with the timer then write down the steps in order and go from there. One problem I have encountered was that it switched from ""summer"" to ""winter"" on its own. Noticing that the time was just an hour off, I suspected that was the problem and easily reset the timer to ""summer"". If this happens on a regular basis, that will not be acceptable."
4,much better than the dial timers,"A great timer for the price! We had trouble with the traditional dial-type timers, they didn't keep time well at all. This one seems to be pretty acurate, after using it for about 3 weeks. The only drawback is that if you put it behind a piece of furniture, the button to turn it to ""manual mode"" can get bumped easily. Overall, a good buy!"
5,Great for the price!,"This hose nozzle (sprayer) is well made and solid. And, it fits nicely into one's hand for a comfortable grip and ergonomics for garden chores. It has a heavy duty feel to it that was a surprise for the price."
5,A song from a princess,"Aaliyah...\Her music inspired many and this song in particular tells women about how they too can be, ""More than a Woman."" Aaliyah will be forever remembered due to her career and her success."
4,Powerful live music,"I liked this CD a lot. It is definitely on the edge--strong emotion and revival fervor--but a solid addition to one's library of Darrell's music. I enjoyed Kate Miner's contributions, too."
1,"NO shipment, NO Notification, NO Explanation","This seller charged my credit card the day of the order, which was unusual since this was the first transaction through Amazon that a seller has charged my credit card for the product before shipping the order. I have waited for over two weeks past the delivery date for either a shipment notification or either an explanation of why the shipment was delayed. So far nothing, so I've asked for a full refund and will not do business with the seller again."
1,L-e-a-s-t bang for da buck :<,"I got the book because of positive reviews. Oops! Great for building a ""babe"" attitude; but, terrible for building a skating technique.Just the most basic concepts are discussed (gliding, stopping, swizzling, etc.) but with NO insight (such as common things a beginner should consider).Author is extremely high on herself which is OK if it didn't get in the way of effective instruction.If you need be told how to be a ""babe"" repeatedly and want to know what's cool - such as butt-pinching and hat swiping, be a ""babe"" and buy the book.Otherwise, there are too many good books (and videos - such as the Bobby Hull, Jr. video) out there to waste your time and money on this."
3,Holiday in Handcuffs / Snow / Snow 2: Brain Freeze,The movies were great. I was dissapointed that they were not closed caption or subtitled for the hearing impaired. For that reason I will no longer order any movies by GAIAM
3,"Holiday...good, Snow...not so good!","Holiday in Handcuffs I just love! I find it really comical and has the 'awww' factor in the end. As for the Snow movies, the first one was just ok. Honestly, the 2nd one I couldn't make it thru it! It didn't keep my attention and I tried!"
1,Not at all what it claims,"Ordered this item to take to band competitions because I have to sit in the bleachers all day. It was no better than most of the other cushions that I have bought in the past. It was very hard and very thin. I ordered 3 of them and even combined, they weren't soft or comfy. Would not recommend them."
2,Not What I expected,"I received this product quickly as always from Amazon. The cushion was much smaller than I expected and did not have sufficient padding to make it useful. The combination of gel and foam should be twice as thick and the cushion itself needs to be longer and wider. This might work well for a child or a petite person, but for a larger frame person, it did nothing. I returned this product shortly after trying it out. I found a thicker, larger dense foam cushion at a local sports store instead."
1,You deserve better,"So small, thin and awkward......you could use a piece of newspaper and your seat would be more comfortable.The picture looked so good I didn't listen to the reviews and had no gift for my daughter."
1,Boring and unimpressive,"This anime is boring and unimpressive. It's loaded with filler, bad writing, average action scenes, a lame/weird plot, a lame/ugly antagonist who wants to rule the world and a team of simplistic, heroic space pirates. If u wish to watch an anime featuring the legendary Captain Harlock, watch the other animes and movies of his; skip this anime. 3.5/10"
4,A masterpiece,"120 Days is a melting pot of metal & industrial. The riffs are heavy and driving, while the industrial overtones create a dark atmosphere. These guys really had something with this sound, I just wish they kept it up on the next album. They put on an incredible live show which was a feast for the ears and eyes."
4,What is everyone talking about?,"I don't know what version some of you bought, but my Blu-ray copy has a bonus disc with the Cowboys game! I highly doubt that they would release two different versions (One with the Cowboys game, one without it), so it seems to me that many of you are complaining about a product that you don't even have! This release is just like the road to Super Bowl 42, it has the last game of the season, and the 4 playoff games. What more could you ask for?, and this time around it's in HD!"
1,Upset giants fan,im a huge gaints fan. was waiting months for this dvd release hoping that that would put at least the jets and cowboys games on it. so dissapointed that they botched up this dvd. dont know where to go from here
5,The Illustrated Guide To Tanks of the World,"This is a fantastic book, well worth the money paid for. It covers just about every tank imaginable from WW1 to the most modern. A very comprehensive guide, filled with top quality pictures and in depth information. If you only have one book on tanks, make it be this one. Very impressive."
3,A movie unlike any other you have seen,"In this film you'll find three tales dealing with the dark under belly of Japan, each story has some nudity or crosses the line between sex and fantasy."
2,BAD SUMMER....,"C'MON ACE OF BASE's FANS...THIS ALBUM IS REALLY A WASTED OF TIME AND YOU KNOW IT. ANYWAY I HAVE TO ADMIDT...THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF GOOD SONGS AS ""CRUEL SUMMER"" ""TRAVEL TO ROMANTIS"" AND MAYBE...JUST MAYBE "" EVERYTIME ITS RAIN""."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I have the album ""The Bridge"", and I thought this album would be somewhat like that. And from some of the positive reviews here, I thought that this must surely be a good one. But I was disappointed when I heard it. Only two or three songs (Cruel Summer, Whenever You're Near Me) are good. The others aren't too good, and some stink (like Donnie). Some songs sound like they're from the seventies, and sound too much like ABBA. But I bought this for Ace Of Base songs - if I wanted ABBA, I'd have bought _their_ album.If you don't have any of the other two albums of Ace of Base, I suggest you buy one of them. Both are really great ones. To conclude, you could find better ways to spend your money, than buy this album. Three or four good songs for 14 bucks aint worth it."
1,What Happened Ace of Base???,"Wow, so disappointed! This was my favorite group. Where is the energetic Eurodance of their past albums? What were they thinking??!"
5,Stands the test of time,"I had originally bought this album in cassette form when it first came out and decided to update my library with the CD. 20 years later, it still sounds good and not dated. The melodies are great, very musical, as opposed to some of the schlocky crap that bands put out. Glad I bought it....for the second time!"
4,MacBook Pro,"The Macbook pro is an excellent laptop to workwith, very fast and no problems at all. However one problem is that it gets real hot and the battery life is not very long, only 2.5 hours. If you dont mind a smaller laptop i recommend buying the Macbook."
2,Armistead - sort out your issues b4 you write another book,"The actual plot of this book (the phonecalls, the discovery, the mystery)would have made a great short story......but Armistead, who is quite obviously dealing with a lot of personal issues (with regards to her REAL boyfriend leaving him) lets all his angst spill over into the book - the whole thing comes across as really needy and whiney.Sorry.I have enjoyed all of his stuff except this - I've got nothing against soul-baring, but not when it's as mundane and ""Me Me Me"" as this.I would buy another of his books though - I have fond memories of his earlier stuff - I just hope he's worked thru all his issues by then."
2,this feels phony,I did not enjoy this book which attempts too hard to be unusual. It is not particularly well written
5,read it and decide for yourself,"This book seems to have generated extremes of opinion. So, I thought I should add my view on it. I have read and enjoyed all Maupin's books. Yes, some are better than others, but in my opinion all are good. This book is a definite change in direction and that is not a bad thing.Fortunatley I read this book without reading any reviews and am so glad I did.I read it in a weekend, a real ""can't put it down at this part"" book. It is EXCELLENT- my opinion I know, but make up your own.Borrow it or buy it, but READ it and decide for yourself. Oh, and its going to be in the cinemas with Robin Williams too."
3,don't expect much,"I really enjoyed the Tales of the City series by Maupin as well as Maybe the Moon. The Night Listener starts out intriguing and definitely has potential, unfortunately Maupin bails out with an ending that feels like a rip off and ties things up a bit too neatly. Reading this book was like watching a movie with a complicated plot that takes you on an adventure and then abruptly ends without resolution with the character waking up from a dream (think ""Wisdom"" or ""Boxing Helena"") then this shouldn't bother you. Just don't get your hopes up and think that it's the caliber of Tales or Maybe the Moon. . .I'm still puzzled by all the gushing critics, it just isn't that great."
1,is this a joke?,"I'm still waiting for the punchline: ""this isn't really rollins band - April Fool's you fools - this is a coverband who usually does contemporary top 40 TRYING to sound like henry and the boys - HaHaHaaah you suckers.."".This must be an IQ test for the masses - the more who buy it, the lower the average rollins listener's IQ is. So it's all a farce, a joke, right henry? right? Now get back in the kitchen and make me a chicken pot-pie because this 'mac-and-cheese-hold-the-mac' aint cuttin the mustard, pal.'how about some new lyrics for ""liar"", in honor of this release: ""...'cause you're a sucker. yeah. i'll crank this cheese out. i'll sell my soul. i'm turning into sting, i'm turning into sting. 'cuz you're a sucker. a sucker. sucker-sucker-sucker-suck!""I think the cover's got it right. It's all about chicks and money (dude).if you like this album, please buy it. buy two. 'cuz I'm not buying one, and henry appearantly needs the dough."
2,This song sends out the wrong message!,"This song has a good beat, good sounds, but why sing a song to encourage adultery and deception. I mean, teens are listening to this song too, and they need inspiration from their favorite singers. Splackavellie, you sing like nobody's business but the topics of your songs ain't cool."
5,"Rich content, well researched and superbly written - a must!",Dr. Williams lends you his vision and takes you on a journey exploring his concept of economic time. His book will challenge you to think in a new way (dynamically) and permanently change your views on competive strategy.
1,"Great reviews, but disappointing","The reviews on the books back cover actually intrigued me - DJ Teece, Al Rappaport actually do not review books uncritically. But in this case there is a big ""but"". The book actually is an extension of an article of Williams published long ago, and the reviews probably still reflect the article and not the book, which is not recommendable. It is strange, for example, that the author refers to the pharmaceutical industry as ""slow cycle"" industry, while everybody knows that there are few industry where time is so critical to success and where radical changes (just look at biotech and the revolutionary changes ahead) occur so quickly and drammatically.The book cites far too many industries to provide any actionable information and it is legitimate to say that it is highly superficial.My clear vote is ""Not recommended""."
3,"Looks nice, but that's all","The AT-AT looks great on a shelf, but as far as a supplement to the Star Wars Miniatures game, it is lacking.Wait until they can't sell them then snatch them up for less."
5,smudged but well loved,"there appear to be light graphite fingerprint smudges on the dust jacket of this book. can't tell if it's the weird off-white color from the printer/publisher or someone just had good time takin' notes with their trusty mechanical bic for crit theory. as for the content of the book, it's another quality work from america's leading marxist critic. what can i say? if you haven't had that ""aha all the great critical theorists are marxists"" moment, then i can't make it happen for you!"
5,Stunning debut,"Out of the many CD's I own, this is one of the few that I just played and played and played when it first came out, and it STILL amazes and impresses me to this day. Michael's searing guitar picking, Joie's rock-solid bass work and Phil's incomparable drumming are all standouts, but the biggest things that this collection of songs has going for it are great vocals and harmonies, original songwriting, and clean, uncluttered production. Each song has its own identity, too - no sounds-the-same issue here! An amazing, true 5-star effort."
4,Great Rock Band,"This CD has it all---a bit of blues, rock, and pop all in one. It sets various moods with sophisticated guitar that is mellow, sometimes angry, and always interesting..... and is a great road trip CD. I am surprised this CD did not sell better. If Da Da ever comes to Orange County, this will be a concert I will definitely go see."
3,jed Clampit,This is a small vise. It holds well for small work pieces but don't try to hammer on a three foot piece of iron with a two-pound hammer. You will be disappointed. The swivel lock works on mine but it isn't fail proof.
5,Not an Atheist...,"No true scientist can claim to be an Atheist. They simply don't have the information to make such a claim. A scientist must be agnostic. In this book, Dawkins is no Atheist, he is agnostic. He does show us how it is possible for life to have appeared with no outside intervention or planning. The entire book would be mere conjecture (as is every book on the otherside of this arguement) it weren't for the fact the artificial genetics work exactly as Dawkins describes. Those that argue that evolution can't work, are simply ignorant of current science (with emphasis on the intentionality implied by the root of ignorant - ignore)."
3,Intresting .,This book definetly doesn't show a Universe that is not desighned . Alot of young Earth creationist and atheist will love this book. Creationist will try to debunk it and atheist will try to prove it !
2,Isn't concrete.,"I'm not arguing against Evolution and I'm not a Creationist, but couldn't a higher power have created evolution? Like stacking dominoes and watching them fall."
1,Old Theory-- reissued,I thought that Dawkins' view is pretty much of a throw-back to long wore out critiques of Design. Nothing new here.
1,Something from nothing?,"After reading this book, I unfortunately have to conclude that the famous Richard Dawkins believes the following statements:-You CAN get something out of nothing!-Out of arational, unconscious, determined (reacts and cannot act) matter, you can get rational, conscious, free human beings entirely by random mutations.Believing that would take far more faith than I possess.For a logically and philosophically sound argument, read The Kalam Cosmological Argument by William Lane Craig."
4,The works,"I bought and read this book because Douglas Adams prized it. Now I do, too. The man, Dawkins, has a mind that won't quit and still conveys meaning easily. This is a book that can be read through or dipped into with good effect. Fascinating."
3,Tedious Reading,"i restrict my reading of this tome to infrequent trips on the train. It just goes on and on and on. Dawkins' brief is to persuade us that there is no need of a deity to explain the process by which existence came into existence. The argument is so obtuse as to almost make me wish God had struck the author down in the midst of his deliberations. Fortunately for him, I am persuaded that no such entity exists. I am having similar problems with Darwin's 'Origin of the Species' so the learned professor is in good company. I find myself alternating between Dawkins and the late Christopher Hitchens to maintain the rage I hold towards religion."
5,This rice is the answer to all of those that want brown rice,"but don't have 40+ minutes to wait for it. It is also for people that want to get the health benefits of brown rice, and don't like the overpowering taste. The cooking time is only 20 minutes.I have no problem buying a case of this as it isn't on my store shelves. In fact, this is my second case.My husband, who doesn't like brown rice, eats this and asks for seconds, When I first told him it was brown rice, he said ""This stuff is good- I don't care.""This company knows rice- thanks for a great quality product."
5,Great Rice - Great Price - Free Delivery - Very Nice,We have been using this rice for ten years. We watched as the price went ballistic. Thanks for offering it at a reasonable price and icing the cake with free delivery.
2,Not a Review,"I was wondering if anyone knew how to give suggestions to the video editors for these concerts. While I can appreciate the artistry as well as the work the dancers are putting in during the concert. I don't think there should ever be a song on the video that shows the dancers more than the artist. Also why do we need to see so many pelvic shots of the dancers? I just watched a concert on cable and it was shameful the way it was edited. Proud Mary, one of the anchors of all of her performances, was a bunch of wide shots, pelvic shots of the dancers, and different angles. It would be nice to just have a long shot of Tina so that you can appreciate the fact that this woman who is 70 is still able to move and keep up with her dancers on stage. All of these quick, jumpy shots all over the place only serves to give you a headache and frustration because you're trying to focus on Tina and are not able to."
4,DVD TINA TURNER - ONE LAST TIME IN CONCERT,"Fabulous DVD of the concert. My only disappointment and query is why the audio only provides 4.1 channel and not 5.1. I have a BOSE sound system with 5.1 ability and it seems that my best option is only 2.0 or stereo. When I select 4.1 on the DVD my rear speakers only generate a ""muffled sound"". I am in Australia. If anyone can provide me with an explanation I will be grateful. Amazon service otherwise teriffic."
1,Tina Turner - Live in Concert,DVD kept stopping during the broadcast then blanking out. you get what you pay for. Product was too much of a hastle to return. Very dissappointed in the operation as other items of this sort that I have purchased from Amazon have worked great. This would not play all the way through - kept stopping and then blanking out.
3,The unsatisfying sound of the piano,"These are wonderful performances marred by the use of feeble, weak, unpleasant, thud-sounding fortepianos. But as unpleasant as the sound is, the engineers could have at least turned up the gain on the thin sound of these solo instruments to create a better balance with the orchestra. I think even Beethoven would have turned up his nose at the sonic poverty of these fortepianos. I was sometimes reminded of a toy piano."
2,Shinai purchase,The shinai was nice to look at but not good for sparring. I was afraid that it would break during sparring. It was also shorter than I expected it to be thereby making it useless for me. I wish that I could get my money back.
1,Save your money,I am convinced that the positive reviews his written anonymously are by Seloc representatives. I own an 8hp and a 115hp Mercury.This manual is almost completely worthless when it comes to specific details. Because it covers so many models the level of detail is very limited. Also there have been numerous times when the information provided is not accurate. It has been rare that I started a job and got any real benefit from this manual that was not quickly available by Googling (eg. wiring diagrams.) On almost every difficult job I had to resort to further research because this manual did not provide the answers I needed. Save your money.
2,Spend the extra money and buy the Clymer Service Manual,"Very disappointed, this manual only covers the powerhead in detail. There is not even a section for the intermediate housing, and the lower unit section is just several pages long and covers water pump replacement only. I have a 2000 model year Merc 200 and the water pump info and illustrations were for earlier models, so even that wasn't helpful.I've had several Clymer manuals for the various engines I've owned over the years, they cover everything."
2,Underwhelming,"The problem isn't the length per se, or that the movie doesn't shy away from Wagner's anti-Semitism. The problem is that the movie has nothing to say. The dialogue is laughably arch, the narrative the same familiar story, and the attempts at arty cinematography generally pointless. And there's absolutely no rhyme or reason to what music is played when, let alone how these mischosen excerpts sound once they're spliced together. There's just nothing going on in this film.If, on the other hand, you're attracted to anodyne paeons to l'art pour l'art, or fancy costumes, or garishly performed and mindlessly repeated excerpts of a few dramaturgically suspect musical snippets, this might just be up your alley."
4,Faust,"This has it all: interesting story, a bit of history, top acting, evocative photography ... and great music."
3,Confirm Length,"I emailed Kultur to ask about the length of the complete epic and received this reply:Thank you for your interest in our DVD's. There is a typographical erroron the box that says it is only 8 hours BUT the tape is actual a 9 hourtape. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.Lauren EllmerKultur International Films Ltd., Inc.Can anyone who actually has these DVDs state what the final running time is?Thanks."
5,Beautifully written and wonderfully spoken,"I just finished listening to the audio version of ""The Mountain of the Women"". It is beautifully written and the music of Liam's voice and the feeling that he brings to recounting his memories of personal, cultural and professional devlopment provides a spell-binding experience. I have been a devotee of Liam's music for many years. I was often at The White Horse back in the 60's when Liam, his brothers and Tommy Maken would hold forth with song and story. This work opens up an entirely new understanding of his background, his upbringing and the forces that shaped his life and career. It is a treat to experience an Irishman's moving memoir that depicts a life that was not founded on drink and poverty, but on culture, beauty and a passion for his profession."
2,Poor quality. Even for the price.,"Used this product a couple of times, then the part that goes around the ear cracked off from the main body. Now it's utterly unusable. :-("
4,too expensive compared to Uncle Ben's,I kept the canister and refill it with Uncle Ben's brown rice for a third or less of the RiceSelect price. I think that government institutions that provide meals such as public school cafeterias should use whole wheat pasta and brown rice. I definitely feel a difference between the brown and white versions plus the brown rice should be cheaper since it is less processed. I ate white rice for more than thirty years. I went cold turkey on rice for a couple of months and then ate only brown rice and there was no problem with the switch. Compare this rice with the cheaper standards at the supermarket. I think the higher cost isn't worth it when both are American produced.
4,Pricey & Tasty,"This is a tasty and healthy option compared to plain white rice. Although a little pricey, I cannot find this brand in my local stores so I'll buy this again when it's marked down. I use a rice cooker and needed to add 1/2 cup more water than the directions recommended. My first attempt came out like a ""trampoline for teeth"" my wisecracking kid commented. He raved after my next attempt comparing it to the brown rice he's had at Pei Wei.Preferring rice to potatoes I do experiment with different types of rice and different recipes. This rice is very good alone, with vegetables and in various dishes. Try it you'll like it!"
3,OutDated.,"The author refers to many websites and out-dated quotes. Good book, but in our info. driven society I would suggest you read something newer or do a web search."
4,Information is old and doesn't include new tools but still worthwhile,"While this book was apt for the time it was written, a plethora of new tools has become available to the online seller to source potentially profitable products.Before it was more or less a guessing game in terms of what will make profit. You had to have a pretty decent business acumen to be able to determine if a particular product would sell.This book does not include all the new profit scanning apps for PDAs and smartphones that are flooding the market, essentially opening up online selling to the masses. Now, with apps like Profit Bandit, you don't even have to do any calculations. You just scan the product and it tells you how much profit you'll make.Without this information listed in the book it is lacking. However, overlooking this, it does provide a pretty decent overview of what the process of online selling is like. A great introduction."
2,"A long, tedious read.","Indians, Pakistanis, English right-wing thugs, academics, swingers, religious zealeots, idealists, pushers and the hopeless meet in London, but do little to create much excitement.A young Pakistini student moves to the big city after the death of his father and deals with himself, his sexuality, relgious beliefs, his family's bollywood-like dramas and his neighbour's idealists (mis)adventures.To rate this book on the strength of the images it conjures up for those who lived in London during that era, might not be the fairest way to judge a book. Apart from the protagonst's unconvincing affair with his lecturer and run-ins with his brother, there is little else to grab the attention of the reader.A slow and tedious read and had i not picked this up for only US$2, the rating would be easily one star."
2,Not Representative,"While I enjoyed the read from a purely entertaining and pride perspective, I found the book fairly unrepresentative of the Corps as a whole. As a graduate, I know what life at West Point is like, and how the Corps thinks and acts. It is unfortunate that Mr. Lipsky chose such a narrow prism of cadets to portray as the whole. For those who truly want a sense of what life at USMA is like, do yourself a favor and visit."
1,Not Very Captivating,"""Absolutely American"" gives you what should have been an interesting look at our renouned U.S. Military Academy, but somehow managed to make it boring. What I thought would be a bonafide look at the Military Academy turned out to be a lot of interviews and stories of a lot of cadets (which are interesting to them and their families, not to me), and, maybe it's only me, but I got the impression that in the strict interviewing environment of the Military Academy the interviews and stories are very much softened with ""spin"". All in all, the book was not very captivating."
5,Awesome CD!,I think Miranda hit the jackpot with this CD!! It is really good. Even the slower songs on it are wonderful. There is an even mix of sweet innocent country girl and the girl who wants revenge!
5,Really Really Really Good!,"This may be one of the best country CDs I have ever heard. I say that because it combines old school instrumentation with great vocals, then mixes it up with rock guitar riffs and irresistible beats. Unlike most CDs you buy, this one doesn't have one ""throw-away"" track on it. Each and every song stands on its own. From the toe-tapping ""Dry Town"" to the yearning ballad ""Desperate"" this is a winner from top to bottom. Way to go Miranda!"
5,Miranda Lambert: Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"This album is a strong, well-crafted follow-up to Ms. Lambert's debut album. It proves to me she is not just another pretty face or figment of some ""American Idol"" publicist's fetid imagination. Her vocal talent, songwriting skill and the endearing way she conducts herself in concert is establishing her as one of the best of this generation of country music artists."
3,"Decent workout, bad cueing","The exercises themselves are pretty effective. However, the production on this video isn't that great. The music overpowers the instructor's voice so it is sometimes hard to follow the routine. In addition, her cueing is just a few seconds too late so you often miss the first new exercise in a sequence. These two issues are likely not a problem if you are used to the DVD but it can be tough for newbies."
1,Airbrush Kit. E-Z Starter by Paasche. Is So Easy To Use,"Well, for a starter kit, I would have thought there would have been an instruction booklet. There wasn't one. This disappointed me. The back of the bubble card has the pieces outlined but doesn't explain how to put them together or how to use it."
5,Practical advice you can use immediately!,"After devouring this book, I immediately passed it to a client who is developing a speaking business. Lenny's book is full of real-life examples and practical tips for communicating clearly and powerfully. Whether you want to speak professionally or just communicate better in your day-to-day life, this is the book for you!"
5,Kick Ass,"Beware--viewing this video will grab you, mesmerize you and cause instant obession with this ""mystery"". Paradise Lost 2 is a must after viewing this!!! One of my favorite documentaries."
3,Paradise Lost (Collector's Edition,I was not overly impressed with this. I am not saying that anything was wrong with it just that it was not my cup of tea.
1,Disgusted,"This film used ACTUAL crime scene footage and autopsy pictures of the three murdered children (the crime scene video was set to Metallica music-seriously?). I was absolutely appalled and disgusted. I don't know how they received permission to use these pictures/footage. Even with permission - they should have had empathy and common sense and at the very least blurred out the images. But, apparently, they were only interested in shock value in order to bolster this so-called documentary. How do you think the victims' families felt seeing these disturbing, graphic images of their tortured/mutilated/humiliated/murdered children? And now millions of people have seen these same heartbreaking images and those poor children are humiliated yet again. If I could give it less than a star, I would. Anyone that would resort to this level of depravity to sell a video obviously has no soul."
5,Wonderful CD By The Orlons !,"Great CD by The Orlons who are my favorite girl group. Particular favorite songs are The Wah-Watusi,South Street,Crossfire,Let Me In,Don't Hang Up,and Surfin'. Fans will love this."
4,Great Game,"I couldn't disagree more with the first two reviews. This is one of my favorite games. If you're looking for characters that look like they're on mega steroids and use superhuman weapons, this is not your game. If that's what you're looking for there are tons like that on the market. Aside from the censorship on extreme gore, the game has incredible depth and historical accuracy; especially the mock battles within the colosseum of rome. If you liked Gladitor, appreciate ancient history, and like a combo of hack and slash and strategy, this game is for you."
5,Not just for aviation buffs,My husband and I first saw this documentary when it was originally broadcast on PBS years ago. It has remained vividly in our memories ever since. The human story here is so much greater than just the aircraft. I've shared this with people who know nothing about aviation and they have been moved by the people and their mission. This is our favourite Nova episode ... wonderful to see it available on VHS. A DVD version with extra footage and interviews would be really special!
