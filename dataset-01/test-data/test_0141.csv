5,GRRR WHEREZ ThE DVD!,Thiz iz One oF ThE GREATEST 80's Movies EvEr MaDe..aN u Think They WouLd HaVe iT OuT oN DVD By NoW...BUTTTTTT THEYYYYY DONTTTTT...WHYYYYY Whyyyyy NoT PuT Thiz Great Funny 80's Movie oN DvD aN make aLL The License To Drive FaNz HaPPy!!! pLeaseee PuT iT oN DvD...Cory Haim an Cory Feldman RULE!! PLEASEEE PuT Thiz oN DVDDDDDDDD!!!!
3,Feldman keeps the movie honest.,"Caught this one on HBO back when I was a teenager and of course it cracked me up. The humor is totally in your face and you just got to kind of enjoy it. But ""LTD"" is no great shakes and could have been insufferable.Corey Haim is the straight man and let me tell you this kind can't act. His character has the lamest development (none) and his big adventure is nothing but a procession of gags. Thank God Feldman shows up to breathe some life into the film and rescue it from falling apart under its cliche-ridden self. The guy has charisma and an honesty about him that I really like. Goonies are good 'nuff 4 me.So, in the end, License to Drive is mild teen fare that deals with a major hurdle for the kiddies in a sympathetic way, replete with requisite super soft-core T&A; and foul language. It narrowly escapes joining the ash-heap of impotent 80s teen fare that we grew up with."
5,great movie,I enjoy watching all types of moviesbut this one has always had a specialplace in my heart. Worth watching!
4,It was great to watch again.,It was one of my favorite movies 25 years ago. A great story based on a true story. Lots of heartbreak. A tearjerker for me for sure.
5,Between the Sighs by Ian Melrose,"Ian Melrose has won awards for his guitar style. If you like the finger-style guitar of John Renbourn, you will like Ian Melrose. The notes a clear and bell-like and the tunes range from Celtic to Latin-American. Check out his playing with ""Norland Wind"", ""Kelpie"" and the Clannad CD, ""Landmarks"". In a nutshell, Ian Melrose is the guitarist's guitarist. Ian also plays some very haunting low whistle and Dobro that will have you waiting for the sweet voice of Alison Krauss to start singing."
1,There Is No Item,I had to cancel my order because the seller could not even meet the deadline of OVER ONE MONTH after I bought the item. Save your time and shop somewhere else!
2,genius jumps to conclusions,"I was disappointed by this book. I had hoped for a brain thrilling breakthrough, new perceptions on exceptional thinking processes. Unfortunately the protagonists simply jumps to his seammingly farfetched (aka non Artistotelian?) conclusions askes a leap of faith for the readers. I'd much rather have learned more about how to change for A to null-A thinking.Of course it is a book best seen in the time it was written (copyright 1945). The structure, with it's chaotic start, that puzzles the reader for the first couple of chapters, is something not commenly found after the 50's.And yes, it is a sf classic, but no, it's not a good read that I can recommend."
3,"Good political info, not enough personal advice","This book does a great job of covering the political aspects of drinking water. It includes a list of major cities and their violations of drinking water regulations, a list of people/agencies to contact about drinking water, and a list of EPA drinking water standards. However, it falls a little short when giving information and advice on drinking water hazards and alternatives in the home. ""The Drinking Water Book"" by Colin Ingram gives a lot more information in a better format."
1,reliability and warranty problems,"A word to the wise on Sony's Vaio line: I purchased one of the Sony slimline computers a year ago and had a hard disk failure within the first 9 months. This was covered by the warranty, so Sony replaced the drive at their expense. The replacement drive failed in about 6 months (when it and the system were off warranty). When I replaced *that* drive I discovered that Sony had given me a used disk when it did the warranty work."
5,Thorough review of all pertinent data.,"Though it can be a little dry at times, ' High Treason' is an upfront, clear and concise accounting of the events surrounding 22 Nov 1963. The dryness can only be attributed to the complete and thourough inclusion of all pertinent evidence relevent to a murder investigation of thie type. Too many of these books tend to sell a story to the reader, and while 'High Treason'does contain some great 'Sound Bites', the research is sound and provacative. The thoroughness of this investigation is more than the culmination of the author's lifetime of work, it is an insight into a decade gone wrong. How the Warren Commission could espouse it's findings is a question that will only be answered by historians decades away. If you are serious about learning about one of the greatest travesties in U.S. history, this is a great place to start."
4,"No ""Conspiracy Theory"" in this writing...instead, Conspiracy ""Facts""!!!","Nearly seventy (70) percent of all U.S. citizens polled believe there was a conspiracy to assassinated President John F. Kennedy. For those familiar with the circumstances involved in his murder, this book provides a detailed analysis of facts, times, and eyewitness accounts that clearly indicate the obviousness of the conspiracy. Those reviewers who found Gordon & Livingstone's writing to be difficult to read may consider a course in ""Hooked on Phonics"". This is not a novel. It is a fact-finding effort that requires the reader to use an analytical approach and understand that it is written in an almost textbook fashion. Acknowledging that, this book is quite informative and although minoninous at times, basically a good read."
1,Buyer Beware,"Bought this unit 48 hours ago, and have already been through two CPU's because of the modem. According to HP's tech support, MS XP-incompatible Lucent modems are being installed simply to get the units on the shelves for X-mas. Will stick with Gateway and Dell in the future. At least there is 'some' quality control."
5,F11 putting out something great you didnt expect!,"The time we all waited for is here, Finger Eleven finally puts out their 3rd cd. We can all tell the difference in each album F11 puts out, and goes to prove they are their own style. I feel they are just as hard as before, just spread out a little more on each song. As always Scott's voice will blow you away, James and Rick's Guitar riffs being some of the most unique parts you can find in any song. The weridest things are the drums, Rich does some of his best beats. Sean also doing some really cool stuff he has never did in other album. This all pulls together as a great great album. Also the DvD is like the funniest thing you'll see!"
3,FE's decline.,"Uhm, Finger Eleven has really been on the downfall since Tip. By all means I'd say that Tip was the true apex of their musical skill, and this self-titled album is simply not on the same level. On Greyest, Finger Eleven sorta moved into a more blunt, less imaginative, and more lugubrious style. ""Finger Eleven"" is basically just a more upbeat Greyest. I guess if you loved Greyest, then go to town with this one.. but I feel that they've lost a lot of their spirit."
3,New Fingerelven,"why do bands feel the need to put out a slow cd after putting out 3 that rocked? i have only listend to it once, and it is not your typical fingereleven. it is like the band is sleep walking through the disc. they do give you the 45 minutes of music you are accostumed too. however i am more likely to throw in greyest of blue skies or tip, maybe even going back to the rainbow butt monkey's disc rather then reaching for this one."
2,Big LEt DOWn,"THis cd is crap. if you have heard the last album Greyest of blue skies, then you no what i am talking about. This cd has about 3 maybe 4 songs. The last cd was amazing almost like COld and Staind feel. But if you were expecting that then for worn not going to get it. This album, i have no clue why, but has become a maintstream album, or a one hit wonder. If you wnat the ebst of the former band called rainbow butt monkey's get their 2000 release greyest of blue skies"
3,....What to say...,"Finger Eleven's 'Tip' is a masterpiece. Take to note to what the previous reviewer said. This cd is good. It has some pretty good songs. Some songs are just not good though. If you want to know why I am such a fan of finger eleven, you should buy Tip right now. This cd is absolutely terrible in comparison to Tip."
2,Nothing Out of the Ordinary,"This band seems to strive for greatness, and by the third song, settles for mediocrity. The first listen is not all that amazing, and although you think it will grow on you, it never really does. All of their songs seem to sound like each other, and the standout single ""One Thing"" does not match the tone of any other song on the CD. By the third listen, I found that my favorite part was a key change in ""Last Scene of Struggling"". Save yourself the money."
3,3rd Release,"Very catchy. Great guitar riffs on the first track ""Other Light"", more great guitar riffs on the second track ""Complicated Questions"", ""Stay In Shadow"" has some more awesome guitar work with dark lyrics. The best song overall on this album for me would be ""Obvious Heart"" the last song on the album. It's a great song to end the album and it seems to have everything in it. This record is not as dark or heavy as their last one, they seem to be a bit more down to earth and more open this time around, but they do a good job with still keeping a bit of a mysterious side to them as well. Great melody. They seemed to tone down on the guitars and exchange that for great soft guitar riffs. Excellent."
2,Run of the mill rock,"Finger Eleven is about as average as they come. Sounding like a mix of Papa Roach (minus the angst) and Hoobastank (minus the songwriting ability) the CD falls woefully short in the creativity department. The fourth track on the disk, Good Times, borders on annoying. So much so in fact, that I find myself dreading it. Musically this disk is so bland it is hard to imagine that they ever got signed in the first place. There are a couple of interesting tracks (Absent Elements, a chunky melodic mid-tempo tune, and Conversations, a drum-driven ode to what appears to be a strained relationship) that warrant the disk two stars. Other than that Finger Eleven is average at best."
4,I liked,The ending wasn't as good as I thought it should of been I thought ruthie should of ended up with the other gie
2,Stops working randomly,"This phone stops working randomly. but yes till the time it works , it is good. Another thing - cud not find mute button on it so might not be good for confrence calls"
5,Dreams and Spirituality,"This little book holds a lot of information and gives a person much food for thought. It is a short and easy read and also a book I will reread regularly. Kelsey has done some great research with regard to the history of using dreams as guides, particularly in reference to the Bible. I agree that it is high time for theology and society to value dreams as connections with our higher power."
5,I wasn't disappointed,I bought this cd because I had heard Axelle Red's Rester Femme a few years ago when I lived in France. Now I'm a French teacher and I'm really happy I added this cd to my collection! tracks 4 and 10 are especially good
2,Not the world's best reading of Schleiermacher,"One should not take Barth's interpretation of Schleiermacher as the Gospel truth; there are some significant errors in his reading of Schleiermacher's theology that cloud Barth's presentation here. Those who have learned about Schleiermacher only through a Barthian lense would be well advised to read Schleiermacher himself. I find that, in this book, Barth fundamentally misunderstands Schleiermacher, particularly in terms of christological issues and in terms of Schleiermacher's doctrine of God."
5,Just what I needed!,I already owned a pair of these and have to say that the ear clips are the best. I can't find any of the newer models that can compare on comfort.
4,Quality hitch but directions are misleading.,"The hitch is top notch quality. The welds are perfect and a thick, glossy black finish covers the whole thing.The only problem I ran into was the directions showed an access hole in the pax side frame rail which did not exist. Kind of important as you need to fish a small mounting plate and a bolt through this larger hole and guide the bolt through the mounting plate and out a pre-drilled hole in the frame bottom about 10 inches away.I ended up cuting a small area at the very rear of the frame, where bumper attaches, and fished the plate and bolt from this point to the pre-drilled hole. Not a very easy task. Instead of the advertised 30 min install time, it took the better part of the day to figure this out and get the small section of frame opened up enough to fit the parts through."
5,Cute cute shoes,Cute shoes but they were too small and there wasn't a bigger size. Had to return and got a fast refund. Thanks
4,A great record...,"The first tune that grabbed me on this CD was 'Little People'... it's got a real catchy head that lingers. The more I listened, the more I dug the whole CD. The performances are first rate (in some cases, inspired) and it's very well recorded. A very good band and a great soloist.Other reviewers mention Kenny G. but I can't imagine why. Berkley is much more old school. This is some classic Jazz. The real deal."
5,"Tried the rest, bought the best.",We got the Graco 3 in 1 carrier as a shower gift and as our son grew we were excited about using it around the house and on walks. Much to our dismay the carrier was uncomfortable for both our son and both parents. We returned it and tried out all the various styles of carriers available. We decided to spent the extra money and go with the Baby Bjorn. BOY ARE WE GLAD WE SPENT THE EXTRA MONEY. This carrier is very comfortable for both Mom and Dad and our son loves being able to see every thing as we walk around with him in it. I would recommend this carrier to anyone and tell them the added comfort is worth the extra cost.
1,Caution - May hurt baby's spine,"I was considering buying one of these for our 1st baby, but the lactation consultant told that new research is finding that prolonged time spent in this carrier may actually damage babies spines because it is not a natural position for a young baby. She recommended using a sling instead because it puts baby in a more natural position. I carried my baby in his sling until he was over a year. He loved it!"
4,Great carrier,"I purchased the Baby Bjorn 2 months ago when my baby was three months old. So far, I use it atleast twice a week and love it. It was a little confusing the first time I put it together and since then is a cinch. It takes me about 2 minutes to get her out of her carseat and into our Baby Bjorn and we're off to the mall or grocery store. She likes it and so do I."
2,strains your back- slings are better and cheaper,"I bought this carrier due to the rave reviews I both read online and heard from friends. I was disappointed. I loved it for the first 6 weeks. Once my son hit 12-15 lbs, it strained my (and my husband's) back too much. I also didn't like how my baby's legs flopped around. My best friend is a chiropractor and she was concerned that my baby's spine was not meant to be holding up his upper body weight at that age. I agree. Little babies are meant to be cradled.I switched to a Maya Wrap sling when another friend showed me hers. It's cheaper (...), easier to put on and adjust, more portable and more ergonomically correct for the baby. My son is now 9 months, weighs 22lbs and I can carry him in the sling for 2-3 hours before my shoulder gets sore. Then I switch to the other shoulder and keep going! Save your money and buy a sling!If you are going to buy a frontpack, I agree that this one is the best. I just think that slings are better."
4,Melinda,"I read the reviews on this site before choosing a carrier to register for. I registered for and received this carrier and love it. My son was able to use it at about 2 weeks old and when he was fussy at night I would get up, put the carrier on and do dishes, laundry or any other things I might have run out of time for during the day. It securely frees both hands. My son would, almost instantly, calm down and fall asleep. This carrier is so easy to put together and adjust with one hand, which is usually all you have. My husband is pretty broad so I didn't think he'd be able to use it but it fits him as well. My only draw back (thus the 4 star rating) is the lower back pain I get while and after using it. I thought my back might just be sore from delivery (still) but my husband had the same complaint so I guess not. I would still highly recommend this carrier, esp. since I've read the other reviews and others don't experience the back pain."
5,The Best!,I had a cheap one with my first child and I finally broke down and bought this one for my second child. I could carry her up to a year old and it didn't feel like I was breaking my back! Such a change from the other one. The straps are thick and cushioned and easy to use. A must! I don't always have 2 extra hands to help me. I highly recommend this if you plan on carrying around your child for any length of time.
1,Great Expectations,"i had to read this book for school. i thought it was the worst book i ever read...it was stupid boring pointless dumn...must i go on. i would not recomend this bood to ANYONE. no offense if you are a lover of charles dickens, but this book SUCKS.thats all...you can read it if you want but be warned...it is very stupid and boring"
1,Not for international adoption,"This book has a catchy title but no substance. While the chapter titles are good topics to contemplate the content of the chapters is lacking.The author considers any adoption other than a completely open adoption to be unacceptable. Of course, this isn't relevant to international adoptions or situations where parents would like to share information with their children but do not have any.Almost every chapter starts with a definition of a word; a rather sophomoric tactic to fill up pages.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. There are much better books out there. This author seems to have come up with a title first then tried to find stuff to fulfill it."
2,I was disappointed,"While the author raises some valid points about the benefits of helping our children understand adoption early on, many of the issues raised seem related more to adolescence than to adoption specifically.(...)If you are expecting a handbook of the top 20 topics adopted children want to discuss, based on research and interviews, you will be disappointed, too."
2,It was Okay!,"This book wasn't what I had hoped it to be. First of all the Author didn't explain her relationship with her parents. All we really knew was that they passed away and it was rocky during her teenage years. As an adoptive parent, I understand children feeling loss and misunderstood, but give us parents a break once in awhile. Most adoptive parents are wonderful, we seek help for the children when needed and change our whole life around to please the children in the family. Why do many Adult adoptees grow up unconnected with their adoptive parents? I just can't understand this and never will. I suppose children could stay with their birth parents and suffer through the drug addiction and alcoholism, let alone homelessness ect. But instead they get homes filled with love and parents who put them first.I doubt, I will buy any other books from this Author."
2,Viewpoint is clouded by authors emotions,"The author here seems to have a very one side view of being an adoptee. I'm fairly certain that if prospective parents read this first, many would run screaming from the adoption experience. I have no doubt that the author experienced the emotions she's describing, but it really does give a very negative view of adoption. I stopped reading half way through."
2,"Depressing and negative, I could not finish it.","After talking with other adoptive parents about this book, I found that many agreed that this book is overly negative and a little dramatic. I could not bring myself to finish the book."
1,Bleak picture of adoption,"As a prospective adoptive parent, I had hoped to find a unique perspective given from that of the adopted child. Instead I found a book filled with apparent regret and loss on the part of the adoptee. If you are looking for a positive light in which to view adoption, I would choose another source. If I hadn't been as well informed about adoption and seen the benefits and wonderful relationships that can come from adoptive experiences, I would be very wary of entering the adoption triad."
2,Twenty things the author wishes her adoptive parents had known,"I bought this book with great anticipation and found myself more disappointed with every page. The author appears to describe her personal issues, which she seems to have categorized as having all been caused by adoption, and presents them as a universal truth about all adoptees everywhere. Many of the issues she describes are very important and deserve attention (e.g., toxic shame, guilt, fear of abandonment) but they are not specific or unique to adopted people. Her broad and sweeping statements are not backed up by any research or anything other than her own unique experience and her quotes from people she has met. Her strong statements about infants who grieve for the loss of the birth mother are highly speculative but presented as truth. The book leaves no room for any experiences other than the author's. As an adoptive mother I found it unhelpful and unsubstantiated."
2,Give me a break!,"I have to go against the majority of reviews for this book and say that I disliked this book. In ch 1 or 2 they mention ""intrauterine rejection syndrome"".... give me a break! I can understand addressing adoption loss, but I feel the book goes too far and gets lost in psycho-babble. I thought that a great deal of the advice was given from the point of view of a person who was bitter over their own closed adoption. Give me some real practical advice, not some mumbo jumbo about an infant being traumatized a day after birth because they don't hear their mother's voice....."
1,"Should be ""The Over-Therapization of America"".","As an adoptive parent, I read this book hoping for insight into parenting my adopted son. I've since consulted with well adjusted adopted grown-ups who laugh at the suggestion of ""uncovering one's grief"". To quote my adopted friend, ""It sounds like the author has taken one to many therapy sessions."" The authors ""problems"" are the natural path that even biological children sometimes take, regardless of how well they are brought up. Sherrie, you need to understand that your parents (not the people that donated the biological material to make you) loved you as thier own, period. God gave you a free will and a soul."
1,Hated it.,"I am so glad to hear the other reviews of this books and that they mirror exactly how I feel about it. I read this book only as a requirement from our adoption agency but wished that I hadn't. It is extremely negative and, although it's an interesting point of view from someone who was adopted far before I was even born and when it was considered very taboo, I found this book to be of little value for adopting in the 21st century.It also has zero barring on the international adoption field and although it has some great chapter titles, the book could just list those and be of more use. Just a list of statements with a cover....allow me to research them on my own. I would suggest The Whole Life Adoption Book instead. Also required reading from our agency but really upbeat and inspiring."
2,Book for adult adoptees who want to feel like victims,This is not a book for adoptive parents but rather for adult adoptees who want to be told that all their problems in life stem from adoption. It is definitely not a good parenting book. The only adoptive parents who would enjoy this book are masochists.
5,Danger Will Robinson!,"And to all the pre-adoptive & adoptive parents who live in outer space! If the truth scares you--please DO NOT READ!You may suffer from buyer's remorse and your ""purchase"" may have feelings that do not mirror yours. It's true! Face it, you have entered into a social contract where the product/child did not have a choice--and suffered a terrific loss. No matter which way you slice it.Some reviewers say the author makes ""sweeping generalizations"". Of course she does. Just like a book on addiction makes generalizations about addicts--most are true. Ms. Eldridge does too.The adoptive parents (most of the one star negative reviewers) are kidding themselves. If you think these aren't issues for your children, then you're monsterously self centered, and your ""good"" relationship with your child is a sham.For the APs who give it good reviews, bless you for your compassion. You're good parents indeed."
1,very poor performance,Nice look but very poor performance. Hard to hear even being close from the phone base. I would not recomend this product
4,A real pleaser...even if not perfect!,"While I can agree with the other review that the Phlat Ball does not always function perfectly, I can also attest that my kids LOVE it. The novelty always generates interest. Our biggest problem is getting it to remain a disc for long enough, so be prepared to clean away dust and sand from the suction surface. Also, this ball works nicely for a game of tag because it is so soft. So, it isn't perfect, but my kids honestly love it (ages 6 & 3)...and older kids find it very fascinating and fun too."
1,disapointed,"Yeah, it will work and seams sturdy, and fits both adults & kids...However, the photo on-line shows a cute duck motif at the top with duck footprints inside. The one I've gotten only has bright blue text ""Game"" where the ducks are shown at top and a simple anti-slip wave pattern inside. I was hoping the kids would think it's cute and use it, but it's not cute! just yellow. Not much better than my cheep white plastic tub that I use already."
5,Dont Trust The Ex,Good movie but some parts were alittle over-the-top as far as believability goes. But all in all I liked it.
5,Get the CD & DVD,"I had the CD but gave it away to introduce my brother to a new act I enjoyed at a festival. I then bought the combo and was thrilled with Josh's performance. This DVD is a great concert show. All the songs are good and the commentary meaningful. I played ""Thin Blue Flame"" over and over."
1,Available for free at NPR All Songs Considered,You can download the entire 2 hour concert from the All Songs Considered web site for free.
5,Great comedy mockumentary!,"""We Three Kings could stand up there with the best of the mockumentaries.""- Film Threat Magazine""The characters are quirky, even downright insane, but the sense is that they could be authentic.""- The Atlanta Journal-Constitution""I liked it!""- Fred Willard (actor, Best In Show & Waiting For Guffman)This is a great indy film out of Atlanta. Fast paced and well directed. If you did not know better you'd swear you were watching a real documentary. Tommy and David are two Elvis impersonators who are not very good at what they do (but believe that they are). They find out about a contest that they believe will bring them fame and fortune so they hire a third Elvis to round out the trio. Lots of original songs and the final number is certainly worth the rental price alone!Download it onto you ipod and watch it when the boss or teacher isn't looking.A+++++"
3,Maasai Book,"I bought this book after spending two weeks in Kenya with the Maasai. I was overjoyed to receive it. It is very detailed on their way of life. The only concern is it is a bit dated. If you are interested in their history and particulars on how they live, it is a good buy."
1,Disappointing - two times over,"I do not recommend this product at all. The first one shipped to me arrived damaged; it had a dent on the top. The replacement that ...sent was worse; it didn't work. When I called the Sanyo company, they confirmed for me that it was defective. Don't waste your time ordering this product."
4,Old Favorite,"I read this book in hardback more than 20 years ago, when I was a wee tot (comparatively speaking). I had spent one day in New York, and I brought the book back as a souvenir. It immediately gave me ideas for what to see when I returned. The book is especially poignant after 9/11, but the city is as great as ever. A great way to taste the excitement of New York--and not just its big public spaces, but its smaller, more intimate ones too."
4,Good summary of the literature,I think this book is nicely written and covers a variety of subjects. What I missed while reading it was more applied examples.
4,Enriching and comforting,"This book offers a Buddhist explanation (and comfort) of the horrific incident on September 11 that engulfed this nation and the world in grief and horror.After reading this book, I found myself to be more accepting of the terrible events that took place and why they took place. She explains how in events are like these that we are all interconnected, how the impact on the victims impacted us as well.She also points that in the midst of human tragedy such as these, a stronger sense of community was born, slowly diminishing the spirit of individualism.I found this book to be enriching and comforting to those who lost loved ones on that day. It may not provide all answers to those asking but at least it provides a different view of explanining the occurance of tragedies."
3,this cd is okay except for the last song,"judging from all the other reviews, a lot of people like billie, and she's okay. she's cute and has a good voice. i'll say that 'she wants you' is a nice song, but 'because we want to' just sounds so dead and hearing it makes me gag."
1,Worked great...until it started to crash my computer.,"I've had this USB hub installed in my computer desk for about a month. I'd probably used it about a dozen times and been quite pleased with it until this last weekend. I plugged in a flash drive and my entire computer shut down immediately with no warning whatsoever. I hit the power button on the computer and nothing happened. Since I had *just* plugged in the flash drive before the computer shut down, I unplugged it and tried again. Still no luck. I unplugged the USB hub and then my computer fired back up when I hit the power button. I tried the same flash drive on a different computer and had no problems with it. I tried the USB hub on a different computer and that one was shut down the second I plugged it in.Long story short: I would highly advise against buying this product."
3,Great Idea,"This USB has done it's job admirably for two years now. Some products don't always charge very well with it and can connect/disconnect/connect/disconnect repeatedly, its not a big deal to me its pretty infrequent, I just use one of the USB's on my keyboard for a charge. But for memory cards, printers and such, flawless."
4,GLORY IS MOST DEFINITELY IN THE HOUSE!!!!!!!!!,"THIS UPBEAT PRAISE AND WORSHIP DISC SHINES ON OPENING PRAISEJAM ""MORE OF YOUR GLORY"" ""STAND UP AND GIVE HIM THE PRAISE"" WITH IT'S ISLAND MELODIES IS A JOY TO THE EARS.THE REWORKING OF ""ANCIENT OF DAYS"" IS MEMORABLE-BUT, THE STANDOUTS ARE ""SHOW US THE ANCIENT PATHS"" AND THE PRAISE CLASSIC ""I SEE THE LORD"". KEITH STATEN IS A GIFTED SINGER WHO USHERS THE PRAISE IN AND FRED HAMMOND IS THE GIFTED PRODUCER WHO ADDED THE GREAT QUALITY TO MAKE THIS JOYFEST THE CD TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION.FORMER COMMISSIONED SINGERS CERTAINLY STILL HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE PRAISE ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Unhappy with item, not service","The service in receiving this product was great. However, this item is horrible. I thought that it would be easy to clean and dry out, but the only opening is the spout, which doesn't dry out the inside of the teapot sompletely. I have used it twice and have reallly been unhappy with it. The wannabe nozzle doesn't stay open long enough to dry the inside out before being able to put it away in the cabinet. I've been wanting to send it back and get another type as an exchange, but I figured that since I used it twice, I couldn't. I have resorted to the old fashioned way of heating water, by way of stove or microwave, while this little worthless teapot sits on top of my fridge."
3,an ok product,I was initially attracted to this product because of the price and color. It is very cheaply made but serves the purpose for the price.
4,Good video,"This is a good beginner video that covers several percussion instruments. The presenter is an effective instructor but I could have done without some of the corny, new-agey stuff that comes up in a few places. In any event, you'll certainly have enough info so that you can go to your local park and jam out with all the other hiipies :-)"
3,Looks nice but not tempered glass,"Mine cracked with a temperature deviation, next time I will get one made of tempered glass."
2,Seems more like a different subject than a sequel,"I loved the book Rebecca, so I went ahead and ordered Mrs. DeWinter and Rebecca's Tale. I was disappointed with both. If you read this book as though it's not a sequel, but an entirely different book, it's not so bad. The author seemed to just be using the characters to support her views. For the time frame when Rebecca would have been alive, I highly doubt feminist views would have propelled her to be admired. I also don't think people would have been as okay with homosexuality in the fifties as the book would have one believe. It's a mediocre book that just doesn't follow suit. The characters seemed to have changed so much they are like different people altogether. The nameless Mrs. Dewinter (wife number two) was made to look pathetic and almost insane. This book was a huge disappointment."
4,Intriguing!,"If you haven't read Daphne DuMaurier's 'Rebecca,' I would absoloutely read it before venturing onto this one. It will make much better sense, and add endless delights to your reading.I thought this book was quite well-done. It starts out painfully slow, but after the first narration, picks up & begins to fly. By the time Rebecca's second notebook is revealed- it's exciting!What I enjoyed most about the novel was that even with the words from the oh-so mysterious Rebecca, right there on paper, there were still endless possibilities as to what truly happened between she & Maxim all those years ago.The original novel is a masterpiece, & Beauman was brave to play with such well known character's- she must have had such fun!The overriding theme of freedom for women & what it means to be denied choices, was nicely done & well said.Recommended!"
2,Pale Rebecca,"The original _Rebecca_ was fantastic - well-written and beautiful. The followup was, in comparison, dry and almost redundant. Although the characters telling the story changed (often a helpful novelist technique), the voice never did. All of the characters therefore adopted a motonotonous tone in telling their stories.The true power of _Rebecca_ lay in the mystery of a woman never met. Placing her in the full light of day in _Rebecca's Tale_, unfortunately, pales her power and mystery. Having enjoyed _Rebecca_ as much as I did, I found the sequel too flat to relish. Maybe the sequel would be better as a stand-alone rather than a followup story, as others have mentioned."
3,"Nice, but - - -","Nice item, but the lens kept falling out. I had to put a couple of drops of super glue on them."
5,For Our Daughters,"This is the book I want my daughter to read as she finishes high school and considers the world of ahead. The story of Sandra Day O'Connor's life is the story of our country and the news events that have shaped our national policy from abortion rights to 911 and to the election of our president. Joan Biskupic is a skilled reporter, who makes you wonder ""how did she get that information."" O'Connor is presented as a deal-maker, centrist and yet in her own right she was her own woman sponsoring yoga classes in the all male bastion of the Supreme Court gym ""the hightest court in the land."""
1,fit for dodge ram,when ordering this gas door cover it states that it will fit the 2003 DODGE RAM 1500 this item only fits chevy and gmc. I am currently investigating a option to send back
5,A Lot of Things Different-But Thankfully Some The Same,Just got through listening to this new release and rediscovered why I like country music. The song writing is so good. Once again Bill Anderson has shown his talent as one of country music's premier song writers. Each song grabs you and makes you feel like you are seeing it played out in front of your eyes. This collection of songs is a must have for anyone who truely enjoys country music at its finest.
1,"Tastes like cookie dough, the brownie kind is delish though","Its hard to stomach bc its just like eating a full cup of cookie dough. I would not recommend these even though, strange enough, I DO LOVE cookie DOUGH even better than when the cookies are baked....theres just something different about it...like...for instance me, I'm trying to lose weight I was thinking of using these as breakfast bars 2 times a week, but it just feels like....ok I'm eating healthy....'and then'.....i pop this in my mouth and its mega sweet and just tastes like batter, lol. Everyone likes them....I mean they're not bad or disgusting.............I am able to finish off one bar....I was just hoping it would be more like a 'bread' - granola bar....instead of a clump of batter. Thats really the only way I can explain it. I would say go with the VARIETY PACK...............this way you can try a few of each, and then stock up on your favorite =)"
3,"Great Product, but high prices on Amazon","I love Clif Bars (all flavors). I think they all taste good! I am however I little surprised at some of the prices on Amazon. It seems like most sellers list the bars at slightly over $1.00. I buy Clif Bars individually at Trader Joe's in New York where they are sold for $0.99. It might not seem like a big difference but a savings of 5 or 10 cents per bar adds up over the year if you are eating 1 or more Clif Bars every day. I'd recommend buying them at Trader Joe's and if you don't have a Trader Joe's in town then try to search some local stores.In short, Clif Bars are excellent and I recommend them to endurance athletes or those looking for a healthy and tasty way to curb hunger while losing weight."
4,Good Book for the Technical Writer,"If you are a technical writer, or want to become one, this book is a very helpful reference and guide. Very useful sections on writing instructions, short reports, and long reports. This book is one of several similar books that should be used by the professional, or by someone learning technical writing."
5,Perfefct kit for Marine Applications,"I love MityVac products, and this little compression kit has a great selection of adapters to make it usable in almost every situation. Need a good kit? Buy this one!"
3,Meh..I think there is something here I'm missing,"Elite Squad has been the recipient of ""Best Brazilian Movie Ever"" and ""highest grossing Brazilian film"" of all time just to name a few. I really don't get what all the hype is. The movie is a perfectly adequate workingman's addition to the crime and corruption drama but didn't rise above the chaff so to speak.The acting is very good and the cinematography worked well for me, displaying the grime and grit of the various environs for which the plot took place. But the constant voice over was too invasive and the film was completely predictable.I think this movie means more to residents of Rio De Janeiro and Brazil as its making a statement at a societal level which perhaps elevates is worth in the eyes of Brazilian citizens."
3,"Subtitles, subtitles, I can't even read the subtitles","I knew this was a film from Brazil, so I don't know why the subtitles surprised me, but they did. Unfortunately, I found that this took away from the film greatly. Also, it was obvious that they were added later because in many cases, there was so much going on behind the subtitles that I couldn't even read them. I found myself essentially ignoring the film and doing nothing but attempting to read the subtitles. Aside from this, I found it wasn't really my type of movie. It was dark visually and came across more about government and how public outcry or support impacts that. Add in lots of violence and you pretty much have this movie. But, I'll fully admit, my opinion might have been different if I could have relaxed and really watched it instead of struggling to read the movie."
1,buy something else...,"My last phone was run over by a passing RV and I was in desperate need of a new one. I stopped by the local Cingular Store and pick this one up. For me it was the look and feel that sold me. Well if all i was doing was looking and feeling this phone would be great, but it sucks at anything else. I can barely hear anyone when I driving. The menu is a big pain in the ass. Cingular didn't even have anything on this phone, so when I bought it I had to manually enter codes in order to get text messaging and other functions working...lets put it this way, here I am on Amazon looking to buy a new phone because this one is useless(and I paid $200 for it at a Cingular Store).DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE YOU WILL REGRET IT!"
1,Not Free SF Reader,"The only good thing about this book was the title. A tedious creeping fantasy. A pity the Myth part didn't refer to an Asprin comedy. The fantasy wasn't too interesting, and it didn't go far enough in the Lovecraftian direction for anything else. Too roundabout for me, I think, even though it certainly sounded like something I would enjoy."
5,Primal Woods,"Mythago Wood...dear lovers of great fiction,... and all the books in this series are about an ancient and primeval wood where the power of the individual psyche and the ancient myths of the land combine to create a stunning adventure. We read a lot of fiction, but there are few books that have captured our imagination and set it going as these books have. Read this one and if it grabs you, you'll know the others are just as good, although, the story is ever changing for they are continually evolving and ever surprising. We loved this series.kyela,the silver elves"
1,Broke after 3 weeks!!,"Plastic around the sprout cracked after 3 weeks of use, now the kettle no longer whistles. Poorly constructed kettle made with cheap plastics!"
3,Does the trick,"I bought this for my 84-year old father, who (for some crazy reason) loves instant coffee. For him, it's perfect - very lightweight and he can hear the whistle."
5,Well-Rounded and worth every penny,"I am not a big fan of Better Than Ezra, and although several of my friends own all their albums (even the online only one), I never had a desire to buy any. That was until I heard this one. Immediately catchy and upbeat, it put me in a good mood the first time I heard it in my friend's car. Having recently gotten it myself, I must say I have yet to grow tired of it. The more down-tempo songs work and are balanced by the abundance of hip-hop and pop-rock inspired tracks. The CD is well-rounded and I highly recommend it, even as a non-fan. Come to think of it, maybe that makes me a fan now..."
4,Great CD,"I loved this CD. I was just browsing in a music store and happened to notice it had just been released. Since I loved Deluxe so much, I figured this one was a pretty sure thing, and I wasn't disappointed. Better Than Ezra is just one of those bands that speaks to my emotions, and this CD is not exception."
5,One of My Favorite Albums Ever,"A few years ago a friend had played several Better Than Ezra songs for me and I found them bland, boring, and uninspired. But years later I had the accidental pleasure of hearing Closer, and I was enraptured. I dont know what changed, but this album is simply brilliant. It is inspired, dynamic, wonderful music. What happened to bring such a change to this band? At any rate, nearly every song on this album is stunning and has a place in my regular rotation."
5,Haven't stopped listening to it!,"This is by far their best one yet! I can't stop listening to it! I was immediately drawn in by Missunderstood. Then I had to keep listening to Extraordinary. Rollin' -- don't get me started. That song reminded me of my younger days, with late night jobs and days off on the weekend and never sleeping and then doing it all over again the next weekend. Get You In is propably the most poinant of songs; a little depressing, but we all know someone like her. I Do is a song for every mixtape. The dream of meeting someone who feels the same way is a rare occasion. If you've never seen these guys in concert, DO IT! You won't be disappointed!"
3,Fun and nothing more,"Taken from the brittish movie magazine 'Empire' this is a collection of selected movie scenes. That is all you get - a bit of text, the film credits and info and a picture from each film. Nicely laid out and fun to read and look at, but not much else."
3,Foundations of Parasitology by Larry Roberts,"Good theory content, but from the top of the book you spect that the images are colorful, but they are black and white... Awful for study parasites."
3,Not sure it is doing anything,"I am about 1.5 weeks into the 'cleanse' and I can't tell if it is doing anything other than keeping my bowels moving regularly. I also found AFTER I got the bottle (and read the label) that in order to do the recommended 30 day cleanse, I'll need another bottle. Not a big deal I suppose as s&h is free from Amazon but really you ought to save the planet the extra bother and expense of another shipment and me the extra time by letting people know the dosage! Most selling something in a bottle are not afraid to show the label. Anyway I'm a bit on hold as to whether I think is worth getting another!"
2,Nothing special,It didnt make any difference. Save your money; The cheaper colon cleanse works much better.
4,Take Care of the worm gear!,"A great entry-level mixer for DIY and light duty construction project. I've used this machine for years around my property for a patio upgrade, to fix our sidewalks, and build fences - among other things. The biggest problem, as others have mentioned, is keeping the worm gear lubricated and intact. It likes to get shredded after awhile... I had a problem sourcing the replacement part in the past so when I finally found where to get the gear, I decided to build out a site to help my fellow red lion owners. You can order the replacement part by calling 1-888-631-3994."
2,"No, I have not bought this set yet, however ...","I think the network that aired this miniseries was ABC and not NBC. I was furious when they would not show the final episode. Instead they showed two pilots for sitcoms that failed (predictably, ""Cafe American"" and ""The Mommies,"" both of which were incredibly STUPID!). Because ABC pulled this on us, I refused to watch that network for years and I seldom watch ABC to this day - so THERE! I don't think I have missed anything either! I bought the book hoping to find out how the story ended, but that turned out just to be a ""prequel"" rather than a retelling of the story shown on TV. I hope now to see the final episode. Don't tell me how it ends!"
5,Evangelism Tool,This is a great witnessing tool. It is an easy read and will inspire and motivate you to share the Gospel of Christ.
2,Seminario básico en hotel,"It appears that is a open demonstration in a location (hotel).It doesnt have enough training quality,its very general.Its history because Soke Sensei Mabuni`s presence.You don't learn a lot."
4,ps2,i ordered exactly this item from here(amazon).they sent me a ps2 special edition which i already had.if i got the real thing im sure it would have been much better.
5,Facinating look into clinical trials,"This book grabbed me from the start since I also have one of those incurable, untreatable autoimmune diseases that rarely threaten your life, but certainly ruin it. Scleroderma patients had a recent, similar roller-coaster ride with what was thought to be a promising therapy. I could easily relate to everyone involved - patients, treating doctors, researchers, and investors. Ms Quinn took very complex material about MS and the research surrounding it and made it understandable, while telling an exciting and emotionally engaging story. Though it doesn't help me to cope day-to-day with my disease, it does make me understand the processes and people involved in the search for a treatment."
5,A terrific foodie adventure!,"I first heard of this novel through Booklist, as I run a small lending library attached to a kitchen store and I try to keep up with the foodie books. When I ordered Liquor, I didn't know what to expect from a former (eek!) horror writer, but I can't remember the last time I was so pleasantly surprised by a book. The characters are vibrant, the food details are appetizing, and the story itself really is ""a love letter to New Orleans"". Bravo, Ms. Brite, bring on the sequel!"
5,Not bad for Disney.,"Primarily I bought it because I just love the story but then I realized it is really good. It's funny, suspenseful and great uh ""scenery"" ;)"
5,A really fun movie,"This is a really great family movie. even though some of the scenes in it may be a little more for adults then children, it is still wonderful. Who cares if it isn't like the book. The non stop action, and great acting will keep your family entertained. This was made during a time where Disney actually started making decent live action movies(the early nineties), unlike some of the really bad ones they make today. and of course porthos is really funny, and I also loved the never ending 'extras' he always carried around."
3,all for one and more for me,"there are a ton of things wrong with this movie, but they have all been covered in reviews below. i will make a couple of observations. it does not bother me that they did their own story, only that they changed the characters motivations so much that they very detracted from the book. the script suffers terribly and alot of the time the movie feels like a fluffy version lacking real direction. the movies saving grace is some funny lines, swordplay and wincott as rochefort. his proformance of the cardinals number 1 henchman is worth watching the movie for again and again. a very sinister protrayal. it is an okay action film which has its moments. but dont go in expecting it to be a serious attempt at telling dumas tale."
1,"Horrendous...should have been called ""Three Guys With Swords""","This movie is possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen. Having been a huge fan of both the original novel, and the 1973-4 movie versions by Richard Lester; I was shocked and disgusted thatA: Disney put their name on it, andB: that they actually had the nerve to call it ""The Three Musketeers.""Possibly my favorite/worst moment of the movie was a spot where a bunch of bravos yell ""It's Porthos the pirate!"" When I saw this in the theater, I distinctly heard three other people around me (besides myself) exclaim ""Porthos the PIRATE???""It's a ridiculous, puerile, pitiful dilution of both a magnificent story (Dumas' novel) and a cinematic masterpiece (Lester's films.)If you want to see barrels of gunpowder explode, maybe you should get this movie.If, however, you want an inspired, dramatic, funny, action-packed adventure that's beautifully filmed, try hereThe Complete Musketeers (The Three Musketeers / The Four Musketeers)"
5,"Classic, awesome movie!","This is a classic, everyone should see this movie! It's fantastic will an all-star cast. Full of action, adventure, and a few funny moments. Tons of sword fighting scenes that are just fantastic. This movie rocks!"
4,"Velodyne 150-Watt 10"" Subwoofer","Velodyne's 10"" sub is a good addition to a small home theater set-up depending on the bass output of the front speaker. The results are a more defined bottom end without it being overpowering. Best advice: buy the product from a retailer where it can be easily returned if it does not work well with the rest of the system."
4,an indelible spot,"I couldn't agree more about the affair itself -- papers, meetings... every details.I'm 11 at that time, I knew nothing abuot it but from newspaper and TV, so what? Who is to blame, the governor or the students? The question is children on today.History will teach lessons"
4,Pollyanna Grows Up,I so enjoyed this second in the Pollyanna series as much as I did the first. They were both very enjoyable reads.
2,Too Big!,"This steamer is too big for travel, it is not so ""compact"" as they say. I did not even try to see how it worked, and returned it when I saw how big it was. If I were to take this with me in a carry-on bag it will take like 1/3 of the space."
1,Sad but true,"Please be advised that although the packaging is clearly marked as 5/8, the hose is actually only 1/2 inches in diameter."
5,I Love Case,"At first I didn't run out and buy this album, but I decided to after hearing,""Happily Ever After."" Then I found the album discounted in almost every store which usually means the worst. Case's hard exterior mad eme nervous that he couldn't really sing. All of the songs are good, and you get to hear how well he can really sing, he is not a one hit wonder. This album is a must have."
5,CAse be da bomb sh*tz yo,yo dis cd is da bomb yo. i checked out all da songs. and like ie neva had da teim to buy da cd. and wen i did damn...hes as good as it gets. his vocals are like mad sweet. and anybody who wants to get personal w/ soebody listen to dis cd w/ dat person. meaningful yo
4,A Pretty Cool CD!,"This CD is nice. It has a mellow vibe that you can just chill to. Case is a good singer and the runs and trails he does are nice. This is really worth checking out, especially for all R&B fans."
3,"inspiration, please","Typical Lonely Planet in that it gives you all the facts, but very little inspiration. Basically for those who have already made up their mind and know exactly where they are going. That said the guide is incredibly detailed, it certainly doesn't leave out much of the nitty gritty kind. Then again, you don`t really need all this info as there are outfitters in Pakistan (forget the US/UK ones) that will take care of all the logistics for you at a price you can't beat, not even doing it all yourself."
4,Good Read!,Island of Girls (and boys) is not my favorite Rachel Hawthorne book but it is still a good read. When I was reading this book in different ways it reminded me of my friends and even though we fight and argue in the end we still love each other. Good read!
5,Art History Vol. I,This book was great! The major ancient civilizations were covered. The photos and drawings are fantastic. Lacking are the non-European civilizations (such as African art) in the amount of information provided. Some civilizations are a mere one or two paragraphs in length before a new topic is introduced.
1,Buyer Beware,"This is certainly not a good product. I've had two of them. The first one caught on fire at the burner assembly while brewing the 2nd pot of coffee. The second pot purchased lasted for 10 pots. Again, it's the warmer assembly, but the second one didn't catch on fire. Camping World refuses to replace the product. It's not amazon's or Camping World's fault. The manufacturer is pathetic. When it does decide to work, it makes a great pot of coffee. But, is your camper or semi buring up worth the risk of a cup of coffee? I'd highly suggest another brand."
5,Great Package Deal,"This is a great package deal. I bought it for Home On The Road because it is a great live album by NRPS, and Brujo is a great album as well. Good stuff by a great band."
1,Terrible,"This book is full of errors. The publisher will do great service to the engineering profession (to humanity by extension) by immediately withdrawing this book from the market. Unorganized, incoherent, almost schizophrenic."
1,Prestressed Concrete: A fundamental Approach,"I used this book for a prestressed concrete class. The chapter headings looked appropriate. But the book is loaded with errors. As near as I can tell, no example in the book is correct. I sent a partial list of errors and the names of my unfortunate students who bought the book to the publisher. They allowed my students to exchange the book.Your best bet is to contact PCI or start with M.P. Collins (out of print, but I found a used copy), the PCI handbook, and fundamental papers."
3,"Interesting, but still flawed","The concept of this book is exhilirating: reviewing thousands of lps, eps, singles, and artists' works and then finding the worst examples of rock and roll in each subject. In many instances, the authors picked the right subjects. Unfortunately, they limited themselves to mostly mainstream artists. Of course, reviewing indie releases would have been a bigger hassle, but its still dispiritng. Reading the book, the points the authors make tend to make one realize that other artists' songs and albums should be there. Goth rock, punk, new wave, and other alternative rock are missing. It could be because the authors enjoy them, but at the beginning they mention how cult artists are as bad as mainstream artists in many instances. Still, the authors are frequently funny, and its nice to know that rock fans can make fun of the music that they and basically us all grew up on without an iota of self-consciousness"
4,Great Guide,"We use much PHP3 for our http://www.siliconmail.com site. This book has been a great guide and resource for our development team. Definite recommendation to anyone looking to learn PHP3 or expand their knowledge of this server side scripting system.Boston Media Corporation Development Team,http://www.bostonmedia.com/"
3,Raccomennatu,"This book was recommended by one of the list members of the yahoo linguasiciliana Sicilian language connoiseurs, along with Lettres d'Amour et de Haine. It weren't for the list, I'd never have even known about this linguistic gem. Now I'm gonna have to see what Neapolitan language gems I can find here on Amazon."
4,The Challenge of Love,"With a grace characteristic of a 16th century mystic, Mother Teresa shares with the reader the gentle wisdom of her soul. Though her personal experiences were extraordinary, her challenge to love, and to view suffering itself as the ""kiss of Jesus"" is relevant, timeless, and deeply affecting. A joy as devotional material or for insight into the mind and heart of a modern day saint."
4,Interesting character personality development,"Considering the fact that Iris starts out the spoiled darling of society, I couldn't help but find her incredibly irritating at times. However, she redeems herself in the end by becoming determined to be the kind of wife she thinks the hero, Monty Randolph, wants/needs...so I can respect her now. Especially since he is of the same mind, i.e., making himself and his life over into what he thinks Iris wants/needs. At times, this story was truly touching. At others, everybody and their brother (especially Iris's) needed slapped. :o)This story contains graphic love scenes."
5,New Favorite awesome bluegrass/jazz,"I had read about this group in the paper, listened to a few cuts and ordered the cd. Played it for the first time today and it was awesome. I checked out their website to find out if they were touring and ""lo and behold"", they were coming to Santa Fe, NM in October. Bought tickets right away, and really looking forward to seeing them in person. Anyone that likes bluegrass, this is a great cd."
5,Oh Yes!,This is simply a wonderful CD. Alison Krauss and Union Station have delivered Bluegrass to a new generation. This IS the true music of the American Heartland. AKUS delivers.A true classic.
4,nice looking and comfortable running shoe,"These are very comfortable for a stroll, run, or anything in between. Look great as well. I love how the fabric on top of the toe has a little bit of give to it, so that they feel really good, and I'm picky about my shoes!"
2,More Than One Step Over the Line,"This will satisfy those with only a passing interest in Mr. Hiatt ... Had the compiler used some foresight and creativity, and kept most (but not all) of Mr. Hiatt's journeyman output prior to Bring the Family off this anthology, it could have been a contender ... Where's One Step over the Line (Will the Cicle be Unbroken Part II)? And Don't Take it Any Further (sp?) (from X-Files)? And Slip Away from ""Where the Heart Is"" soundtrack? And all the unreleased and live stuff? What we need is a box set to pull together his output from side projects and unreleased material. My recommendation: Start with Bring the Family, then Crossing Muddy Waters, then fill in the space ... Hopefully, it will spur you to dig deeper. ... For the rest of us, the wait continues ..."
3,"Not the most exciting addon, but functional","The no mess hall is somewhat deceiving in its name. My hamster immediately took all the food out of the hall, one small serving at a time, and stashed it all in other parts of the cage. Since this is pretty normal behavior, don't assume that getting this feeder will stop your hamster from caching.However, it does dispense the food rather easily and is easy to fill and connect. It does not come with a connection ring, however."
2,Food Flow Problem,"I loved the idea of the No Mess Hall add-on feeder, so I bought one. However, I soon realized its drawbacks. First, unless you're using extremely small pieces of food, the food won't fall down into the bottom chamber freely when you fill the bin from the top. I felt like I was trying to shove walnuts down the neck of an hourglass. Second, my hamster made a mess in the tunnel. Food was strewn down the connecting tunnel from the food bin and flew everywhere when I removed these pieces for cleaning."
4,A very good metal album,This album is one of the best albums Venom have ever released. I wonder why there aren't many revieews since its a very good album. Its very loud and heavy. I believe that this album with Black Metal are their best snt the albums any new to Venom should star .(Or buy the In memorium which is their best of in the <<old times>>. . I recommend this album to anyone who likes thrash metal and extreme metal.
2,Nice idea but too big,"This is a great idea and something that is necessary for continuous game play, but this one is just too big. Mad Catz makes one that actually fits into the battery compartment so it doesn't add any bulk."
2,Disappointing collection of chocolate cookies,"I have two other cookbooks by these authors, The Ultimate Candy Book and the Ultimate Ice Cream Book so was really looking forward to this one, especially as I love to bake. There is not one photo, and the recipes are just lumped in alphabetical order with no kind of grouping by type. I didn't see too many original or exciting recipes but I will say there are some helpful general tips on baking at the front of the book."
3,Stick not included,I actually work for circuit city and just recently purchased the Son dscp50. We have a sign that tells people that the memory stick is not included in the accessory kit(it's in this week's ad ending 2/9/02) It's a good product and I just bought one. This site shouldn't allow false advertising either.
3,Audio version review,"The book itself -- long and leisurely paced -- is pleasant enough, with interesting characters and the lovely, intricate use of language I've come to expect from Erdrich. However, the ""Audible"" version of the book is read by the author and that was a big mistake. I wish publishers would forbid writers from reading their own work. Erdrich uses a far too soft spoken (almost whispery) voice, with little intonation or vocal variety. In addition, she does what so many non-professional narrators do: use an overly careful enunciation so that every word is spoken oh so precisely, with every syllable given the same weight. It sounds too static and ""read."" In the hands of a gifted narrator, the book would have been greatly improved."
3,Needed a Little More Focus,"The Master Butchers Singing Club is a novel made up of beautiful sentences and wonderful paragraphs that somehow don't gel together as a good novel. The novel lacked enough focus to make it truly enjoyable, and thus winds up all over the map. As an example, the first chapter of the novel deals with Fidelis, the master butcher of the title, how he gets to America, etc. Then we meet two other characters in the next chapter Delphine and her partner Cyprian and at a certain point the charcters meet, but Fidelis is never developed as a character and Delphine and Cyprian's antics just didn't seem to fit with what was happening with Fidelis. I am not saying a novel has to be perfect and tightly packaged with everything fitting together--I just think that this particular novel lacks a certain cohesiveness that would have made it a much more enjoyable read."
4,One of her best,"I love the way this story unfolded. It was one of her most satisying movels, and I love her work."
3,Haven't read it.,"It was suggested to me, and I bought it as a gift. I don't know if the recipient liked it or not."
5,Wish I had her to look forward to...,"When someone sees me carrying one of Louise Erdich's books and asks how it is, my first question is, ""Have you read her other books?"" If the answer is no, I reply ""I'm jealous. I wish I had her to look forward to."" Her books never fail to meserize me, from the first page. With flashes of dark earthy humor and knowledge of the territory surpassing any other writer, she brings to life a place and people so vividly, the reader feels they've been there. Her geography is distinct, like Faulker's Yoknapatawpha County. As are her people."
5,Wonderful book,"I cannot believe the person who said her book group didn't like the book. Everyone in my book group absolutely loved it, and so did I. I think it is one of the best books I've read in years. I put off reading it for a long time, because the subject matter and setting seemed a turn-off, but once I started, I found it a real page-turner. The characters were wonderful and involving---I cared about all of them, with all their flaws and eccentricities. The totally depressing location became a vital character in itself. Absolutely gorgeous writing...everyone in my book group agreed we kept stopping to read a particular sentence or paragraph just for the beauty of the writing."
4,Lyrical Tale of Love & Loss,"Erdrich's style possesses eloquence and elegance. The author's words sing just as loudly and powerfully as the men in Argus. Initially, I thought this novel overly ambitious, as she follows characters over many decades. However, the raw, bitter truth of these characters' lives endeared them to me. As readers, we witness rushed marriages, failed marriages, and necessary marriages. We witness death. And life. And sorrow. And hope.What I love above all else in this novel is its humanity--its naked and unencumbered humanity. This is a beautifully written novel, and Erdrich masterfully connects each strand of plot to create, in the end, a rich portrait of these characters' lives."
3,Not up to Erdrich's standards,"Just came back from a Book Group discussion. We found the book very disappointing. Erdrich's language is poetic with lyrical descriptions of sights and smells. However, there were too many loose ends in the plot that are never satisfactorily tied up. Characters weren't always clearly drawn. Particularly disappointing for the Erdrich fans among us."
4,Jaw dropping conclusion,"The book club I belong to had decided to read this book. After the first 50 pages, I was bored to tears. However, once the initial backdrop is established, the story started to really get good.The book is set in post WWI where a soldier from Germany comes to America and sells sausages in North Dakota. At the same time, he crosses paths with another woman whose own life has been trying and difficult. Thru cirmcumstance, the lives of these two intertwine and the author does a good job of establishing real, three dimensional characters. Additionally, Erdrich masterfully describes the challenges of the late 20's and early 30's, before the modern conveniences we have so grown accustomed to.After writing a moving piece, Erdrich blows the reader away with a jaw dropping conclusion that will leave you speechless."
5,Required reading,"This text ought to be required reading.Not only is this the best book I have read in the last five years, it is also *the most* disturbing. Gross details the problems in contemporary schools (K-12), providing ample evidence for his positions.I am sure that ""The Establishment"" will meet this book with rage, and it comes as no surprise why. If you want to know why our schools are in the state they are in, read this-then weep."
4,And the nitpicking goes on . . .,"Just a correction to a review by Andy Field: yes, the odds of three thrown coins coming up all heads is 12.5%. Ditto all tails. But the odds of their coming up all the same, heads OR tails, is 25%. Just as I said."
1,no steps would be better...,"My God the first two books step by step for VB.net and C++ are GREAT... so what happend to this one... well I don't know, but it lacks direction. Also if you are going to do a step by step you should go step by step... not put alot of ""..."" because you assume that if you are reading the book you must be in front of the computer. I would have gave it a 0 STAR but the drop box doesn't go that low."
3,Too easy and then too hard,"Actually, first half the book has a very nice step-by-step progression for someone starting C# (somewhat painfully slow if you have had some programming background, however). Then you had better be holding on to your seat because it jumps into some advanced topics like OO and delegates and (in my opinion) does a poor job of explaining them. I got totally confused reading this books explanation of delegates and after reading a few sentences in my other C# book (Mastering Visual C#.NET) on the subject, it made perfect sense. In fact, although this is not a bad book, I think that Mastering Visual C#.Net is much much better...maybe one of the best I have read, in fact. (and I have read most of about 15 .net books so far)Anyway, it you like are very very gradual start then it may be worth getting for the first half, anyway...but there might be better, even for that...EarlT777@Hotmail.com"
1,Big letdown from prior years,"This volume is grossly inferior to its 2000 version and competing annual wristwatch publications in that (1)it omits prices,whether in Swiss francs or US dollars(2)a substantial amount of the illustrations are from the brand public relations materials without data and(3)recognized brands such as Lange,Blancpain,Breguet,Franck Muller,Glashutte,Ulysse Nardin and Vacheron Constantin are given much less page-space than such lesser brands as Bedat,Clerc,Concord,deGrisogono,Ikepod,etc.Save your $$$$ and buy Peter Braun's annual."
5,Excellent Relax Music,"My first (but not last) CD from Secret Garden. This is great music to relax to, or for those lazy days."
3,"Good, but it is more of the same","After the two previous records, this album is good, but it is more of the same, same sound, same rhythm, same style, they show little differences over the other two albums. (same as Cusco, once your listen to one album, you have heard it all) if you close your eyes and listen to the music, you can not tell from which album it is; you can swear that some songs were already included in the previous albums. Recomended if it is your first Secret Garden buy, but not for the third one."
1,How innoncent can one get?,"Seems to me few people have really read the koran. I did! It's boring as hell, full of contradictions, threats and punishments and apparently neither the author nor the one who put it on paper were very much inspired. It's a pity it is so boring, otherwise more people would read it and become aware what a dangerous philosophy this is about. In the name of God, everything is possible and authorized. And think about this one: ""Why don't they contemplate upon the Qur'an. Had it been originated from anyone besides Allah Ta'ala then it would have been beset with inconsistencies and contradictions"" (S 4 V 82). It says it all, doesn't it?"
3,Not bad,"This is overrated, but as always I will give it a fair rating.The mug has seams from when it was manufactured via injection mold.It doesn't hold heat as well as ceramic bowls and mugs. It doesn't clean up as easily as a ceramic mug.But if you want rubber instead of ceramic, then this might be the for you. It is perfectly functional, and, on the plus side, was made in Minnesota, United States."
3,"Best for loading shave soap, not that great for making lather in.","Theres a big space in the bottom for a soap. Since it's rubber, water seems to just slip out of it. So when you need a little bit of water inside to start building lather, it's going to be bone dry.I keep a spare soap in this, it's just terrible to build lather in from a shave cream. I rather use a ceramic bowl or mug for that, but the reason I bought this because of the reviews and I like the idea of an unbreakable mug. But alas, I saw a wooden mug not too long ago on another shaving website.But yeah back to this, if you're big on using soaps. This is great for you, it's perfect to load your brush but I always heard you're not really supposed to build lather in the same mug as you load your soap but I always do anyways so whatever floats your boat I suppose."
1,I must be something wrong.,"Read the directions. Put amount needed in, did a PH re-test, still high waited till the next day, put more in. Still high, waited another day. Did this for 4 days, PH never came down. Obviously I don't understand the full spectrum of what's going on here, but if your in my shoes don't assume this will fix your high PH problems. I'm sure it's not the products fault, but it's definitely not as simple as putting in a magic product to make your tank have good readings."
3,not bad but not up to his usual side-splitting self,"Sharpe is funny. Indeed, very funny. His various other books (wilt, P-H blues etc) are hysterical. in fact they require a health warning on the front as they are so funny that if you are not wearing a corset your guts could end up on the floor."
5,Classic games never lose their appeal.,"Played it first on N64 when it came out, and now my kids get a chance as well. Of course, graphics are always improving over time, but a good story and attention to detail are what make Zelda games continue to be so fun to play. Playing Ocarina of Time again makes me feel like I've been away awhile and just returned to the innocence and wonder of my childhood, just like it did when I first played it years ago. That's classic."
2,Stay away if you are a tech junkie,"As others have said, with other 2.4 GhZ techs, there is a strobing horizontal line, and clicking with the audio. I had the transmitter and receiver about 15 feet away, and could not get rid of this. I tried different channels on my 2.4 GhZ internet, as well as my 2.4 GhZ phone. Trying to use this product with both other technologies was just getting to greedy with wireless! They just need to invent one that goes over the wireless LAN!"
1,Hard working but unoriginal,"I have to say that this is the biggest rip off band of the decade. They duplicate the likes of Sacramento based Far prefectley. I can understand having influences but this is rediculous. The new album sounds muddy and colorless like most major releases latley. Their older recordings like ""perfect example"" are much better. This is plastic and has no soul."
3,life jacket rocks,"The only part of this cd I like was the song ""life jacket"". It was an awesome song."
5,Peerless...,"All I can say is - Wow! I never expected Ab Fab to be popular in the States. I'm a Brit who realises that our humour doesn't always translate well Stateside.I have seen most (if not all) of the episodes here on the BBC when they were originally aired. This team was definitely one of the funniest ensembles ever to make a comedy in the UK and we all loved them for it.If this sort of humour travels, there are others that will as well... keep a look out!"
4,Great British Humor,"If you enjoy British Humor then these shows are for you! The main characters are fashion designers. They drink, do goofy stuff, and exhibit out-there antics. This is humor for the adult-partier-grown-up."
3,Product color,When the product arrived it was not the same colors that are in the picture. I was expecting pastel colored bugs and they were primary colors.
4,Love Bugs,"My son loves the bugs. I have 2 on the handle of his car seat and one on the bar of his play mat. They keep him entertained forever!! He loves to grab and pull them down to him...and of course they always end up in his mouth, as most toys do. The only downfall is that he pulled on the one bug so much that I had to sew it b/c it's head was coming off! But now it's as good as new."
5,So Entertaining!,"My son got these for Christmas when he was 4 months old. We put them on his carseat, and he loves them! Every time we take a car ride, I can hear him playing with them. He crinkles them and bats at them and jabbers to them. He used to cry on every car ride, and now he spends quite a while playing with these little bugs. They've been a lifesaver for us. Also, when I bring him in from the car, he will watch the bugs swing around for a few minutes while I remove my coat, put up a few groceries, etc. I've read reviews that were negative towards the vibrating feature on the round bug, or towards the rattling beads in the dragonfly, but honestly, my son couldn't care less. He's not strong enough to pull the vibrating bug anyway. He loves them just as much."
4,Baby loves them - but jitter toy broke,"These are great! My baby girl has loved these since she was just a few weeks old (she's almost 6 months now & still loves them.) At first, I'd place them on the sides of the car seat handle, so they'd catch her peripheral vision. It's been fun seeing her develop & her enjoyment of these little bugs just keeps developing, too. First she just watched them, then she batted at them, now she grabs & pulls & of course, tries to eat them. Only problem is that the jitter toy (the firefly) broke a long time ago, before she even got to the point where she could pull it & enjoy it. Still, she doesn't know she's missing anything."
3,car seat checker,"HANDLES DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am a car seat checker. These are fun thinks for babies to look at and bat at. However, I infant carrier car seat handle should be down at all times when traveling in the car. If the handle is up if will hamper the safety design of the car seat in a crash. The car seat is supposed to absorb the impact and gently swing up into the back of the seat of the car. If the handle is up the handle will hit the back of the seat in the car and jar the baby. HANDLES DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Troma doesn't hate you, Troma loves you...well, they love me","This is an insane movie. There is no doubt about this. My sicko friends love this, especially the ending. It has to do with a guy who grew up in the woods luring kids into a cannibalistic cult, where they sacrifice adults. It's stupid as all hell, but it's so much fun to watch. The ending is a laugh riot (though it probably shouldn't be) where all the adults band together and slaughter their own kids. It's gory, it's cheap, and it comes with a free spatula! Ok, it doesn't come with a free spatula (good marketing idea though), but I'm willing to forgive Troma because they've been so good to me all these years. To quote the movie, ""Will you touch me now, Uncle, the way Grendel touched Mother?"" Have fun kids!"
1,Why does Troma hate me so much?,"Horrible...boring...horrible...disgusting... horrible... Troma has made more bad films then I care to remember but this one takes the cake. Shoe-string budget, terrible actors, the worst special effects this side of Plan 9... Simply put, the worst film I've ever seen (yes, even worse then Gore-Met, the Zombie Chef From Hell)."
4,It's TROMA.,"That's all you need to know. It's not meant to be frightening or creepy or ""good"" in terms of cinematic classics. All these people that are rating it 1 because it has bad special effects and isn't scary, they just don't get it. At all. Lloyd Kaufman is a nutball. He's a cinematic genius. They make their movies to be absolutely ridiculous, and for some reason, alot of these people just do NOT seem to get it. I find it hilarious that they're so completely oblivious to the fact that it's not serious in the least. How could anyone think that a movie about children being brainwashed into cannibalizing people could possibly be a serious movie? If you want to see a movie that was meant to try to scare you, go watch The Ring. If you actually have a sense of humor and find bathroom humor, crappy sfx and dubbed-in fart noises laughable, watch Troma."
4,Goog Book but Sometimes VERY Dry,"One thing is for sure about this book... Some of the chapters are (1) VERY dry, (2) have looooong run-on sentences and (3) at times are quite difficult to figure out their logic/order. Chapter 2, for example, took me nearly a week to pick apart the run-on sentences, eliminate the 'garbage', piece together the 'meat' and then try to make sense of what was being said. It was painfully dull! Some of the other chapters, too, were about as exciting as reading a dictionary.I haven't taken the test just yet, but I did find this book to be quite nice. Explanations are very good and overall, it's organized quite well. I'll post more after I take the test!"
2,Feeble effort eclipsed by earlier works,The author's effort to set the record straight falls short since he spends most of his time trying to improve Montgomery's image as well as the image of the British Army. The British Army does not need his help and he failed Monty. He was quick with evidence supporting his view and showed a general lack of anything approaching extensive research. His brief synopsis on Patton included several glaring errors. All in all a mediocre product.
4,Just didn't care for the ending...,"I only read D. Steel when her novels have historical settings. This had great character development and well written storyline. I hated just hated the ending, however. The reader after having gone through the book pulling for Nick/Cassie has no closure. Where's the epilogue? It was just wrapped up too quickly and they were not given enough momentum to propel them to the next chapter in their lives. Disappointing. Otherwise this would have been a definite 5 star. Try Jewels or Mirror Image for similiar historic settings and well written storylines."
1,Drab and Uninteresting,"It is more of a history of the characters than the history of RSA or cryptography. I would recommend Simon Singh's The Code Book for anyone wanting to learn about the history of cryptography. In just one chapter of the Code Book, Simon Singh puts in more unbiased and detailed information in an infinitely more interesting and readable manner than Levy crams in this whole book of uninteresting chapters."
3,Dry but informational,"Steve Levy presents an accurate picture of the events surrounding todays crypto debate in his book ""Crypto."" Unfortunately, he does it with the same narrative style he uses for his magazine articles. The result is that the events are correct, but the story unfolds more like a textbook, not a novel.Overall, it is an interesting (if dry) read, and, at times will add words (a la Neal Stephenson in Cryptonomicon) to your vocabulary. If you are interested in the history of todays debates on cryptography, I recommend it. If you want to know more about cyphers and other code making/breaking, I would recommend something like Simon Singh's ""The Code Book."""
1,Very disappointed,"The book i ordered was meant to be new with no shelf damage. By the time I received it, it was in very poor condition. It looked like it had fallen off the back of a truck."
5,A must buy for ant PS2 owner!,I have seen many still shots for this game and they are unbelievable. This is one of the few PS2 games that uses the full power of PlayStation 2. Levels and storylines unfold beautifully as you play through the game.
5,....,.... I had never played any of the Twisted Metal games but now that i have Twisted Metal: Black I want all of them. .... But this is just a awesome game. A 5 star for sure. It is a must have for the PS2!! Thanks and I hope u all go and get this game. .... Thanks
3,Not much new but a solid implementation,"Generally nothing new here. Same game as Carmagedon but less fun. If you liked Carmagedon 1 you will be disappointed by this game.What's good about it:Frame rate is way up there for a larger terrain map. Game is very responsive.Menu art work and interface nicely done.Music is good.Weaponary is fun.What's not good about it:Scenary is dark and foggy. Partially because the story calls for it but probably to cull most of the terrain away.Dynamics are not as good as Carmagedon. When cars crash or flip over the physics are not quite right. Considering Carmagedon came out probably over 4 years ago, I am disappointed by the dynamics in this game.Cars do not deform as well as in Carmagedon so you have to look at the ""health"" meter to figure out when your car will blow up.Extremely difficult even on easy level.Game has less personality than Carmagedon. You don't get screaming pedestrians, tourists and cows."
4,"Creepy, Dark . . great!!","I've been a twisted metal fan since I played the first a bunch of years ago with a friend, ended up renting part 2 & 3 and buying part 4 the day it came out, when I herd about twisted metal: black,...I ended up Renting one, with the game, and I must say, you couldn't even see this in a horror movie!the story is simple . . a bunch of maniacs from an asylum, all have there own flaws,...they all compete in the ""twisted metal circus"" where they compete to the death and get one wish they want! with cars suched as a blood caked ice-creme truck, a hurse, a war truck and more!forget your past TM games, and get this! disturbing, creepy, gothic, you need it!a 4\4 star game"
3,Twisted Metal: Black,"Twisted metal black wasn't as good as Twisted III. The graphics are awsome and levels huge but there are some flaws as well. Like the firing system is very complicated, two, the computer playes are very tough and turning down the level of dificulty doesn't help vey much! I bought because it was cheap, but it just sits on my shelf most of the time!"
1,Not good music,"First of all Lenny Kravitz is not a talented musician. Second. Cree need to keep doing cartoon voices. These songs sound like they were sung by Suzi from the ""Rugrats"" trying to sing. The lyrics sound like they were written by a 10 year old. Just another Blah band!!!!"
5,A revelation,"I have never had any time for Lenny Kravitz, possibly put off by his ludicrous strutting and outlandish hair. This is an extremely well crafted album, however, and the voice of Cree Summer compliments the songs perfectly. Apart from the last song, which frankly does not seem to be in same mood as the previous songs, every song is superbly sung and the stand out songs have to 'Miss Moon', 'Mean Sleep (a great duo with the aforementioned Kravitz)', 'Naheo', 'Delicously Down', 'Fall', with the rest also excellent. If I mention all of the songs save for the last one, however, that will seem absurd. Buy this album, it will not be regretted. Still think that too much strutting is effected by Kravitz though."
3,A Nice Debut,"When I learned that Cree Summer was going put out an album I had to pick it up. Street Faerie fuses rock and soul in such a way that L. Kravitz's presence is heavily felt throughout the record. Personal highlights include ""Deliciously Down"", ""Mean Sleep"", and ""Still Heart"". A very nice debut for Cree Summer into the world of music and I am looking forward to her future projects."
3,Disco Mann,"Both of these albums came out within two years of Herbie Mann's disassociation with Atlantic which began in 1960. While ""Super Mann"" is listed as being released in 1978, according to the liner notes ""Yellow Fever"" came out in 1972. I don't know who came up with this date but it is definitely false. I believe the correct year was 1979.Be that as it may, the reason Herbie Mann left Atlantic was because he was being pressured to reproduce the kind of successful formula he had with the top 20 hit ""Hijack"" from 1974's recording ""Discoteque."" It would appear that ""Super Mann"" and ""Yellow Fever"" were the result of the afore-mentioned pressure. Taken at face value they are not bad disco albums. If you really like Herbie Mann and if you really like disco, then you'll probably like this two-CD set."
4,One of the best links out there,"this is one of the most best link cables out there u can attach another link to the link that this link cable has u can connect others into this one its Awesome go buy it its great for games like pokemon,yu-gi-oh"
3,Not what expected but still works.,It's not at all a Nintendo link cable. It's some off brand one. It works and it also compatible with a normal Game Boy (Not only GBA). It's gonna do what I wanted but yeah.
4,Good,Good product not what I expected but gets the job done either way you look at it thank you for a good quality product
4,"A funny, clever, sexy, beautiful film.","I loved this movie! It was funny, beautiful, and had great characters and sparkling dialouge. Jorge Sanz is gorgeous and all girls are funny and well drawn. Beautifully filmed, sentiments not laid on with a trowel, thank God!! Sexy, but not gross. Ending not VERY surprising, but a couple of good twists. Excellent acting by all, several hilarious elements. A few slow parts, but all in all, a great movie. Actually, I only wish I could give it four and a half stars instead."
1,not working,Cheaply made and not working . Tried for 30 minutes to trouble shoot . No clue how to make it work
1,STINKS!,HAD IT FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL WAIST OF MY MONEY!!! COULD HAVE AT LEAST LASTED A YEAR!!!!
5,Excellent Word Source,"I have written a dictionary and have studied them for years. In my opinion, the R. D. Word Finder is one of the very best books of its type. What I particularly like about the book is the care with which commonly confused words are disambiguated. See, for instance, the distinction explained between strategy and tactic. Then compare the distinction made in RDWF with what is commonly presented in most other word references. I think you will then see that the RDWF is really quite good."
3,Kalifornia,Brad Pitt is a real low-life with mental problems headed for Kalifornia any way he can get there. Juliette Lewis as his love interest is a not-so-bright good girl/bad girl. Timid David Milford and determined Kathy Larson are the middle of the road couple with the car. This strange mixture does not bode well for the trip from the git-go.
1,They have made homicidal maniacs boring,"Here's a quick recap of this B movie. Lewis plays a waitress in her usual moronic, whiney, deer in headlights, wide-eyed stupid way. She of course is in love with Pitt, a run of the mill red-neck who sits around drinking beer all day and chewin tobacky. (Insert Woody Harelson several years later). Then we have the X-Files guy, who is as boring as a second coat of paint. He is a writer, now ain't that excitin. He sits around whining all day about how the death penalty is bad and we should open up all the prison gates.I have looked deep within myself and cannot understand all the positive reviews of this film. I have watched Tom and Jerry episodes with more dynamic acting and plot. Skip this trash folks....."
3,Blu-ray version is unrated only,The picture of the box is wrong. Must have been a pre-production picture. Only the unrated version is on Blu-ray. The included DVD has all 4 versions (rated/unrated widescreen/fullscreen).
5,Outstanding New Oasis!,"This new oasis is fantastic. Who would ever of thought 3 years ago that bongo drums would enter a oasis song! This is the best oasis for a long time, Noel Gallagher has really written a song that has so much meaning and love surrounding it. And finally people cant say it sound just like there last hit! One way road and Helterskelter could not be better b-sides. Both sung by Noel they are fantastic and One Way Road was the most anticipated Oasis B-Side for a long time and its really lived up to the hype. Its fantastic as well as the 5 mins Helterskelter. If you buy a Oasis Single, Get this one! Its Great!"
3,Adorable yet delicate.,This is a very cute table that will impress you with its beauty. The only down fall is that the material is not of best quality and is easy to break. One of the chairs arrived broken. Good thing we are handy folks and we fixed it right up.
3,Not as good as dune or the dosadi experiment,"I first read dosadi and realized it was a sequal., finally finding book one I was really expecting so much more. Learning about this world and its speci really appealed to me. No such luck. Its not a bad book, just not the Herbert I've come to know and love. Frankly its nearly all about communicationbetween two alien races with very different realities."
5,"""It is because you speak to me that I do not believe in you""","One of the best short stories I have read, Whipping Star is most memorable for Fanny-May, an extra-dimentional Caleban whose death will mean the end of life. I definitely recomend it for any lover of fiction"
3,2 words... BETTER GRAPHICS!!!,"I am very disappointed with this game. I must be the hugest Survivor fan in the world and I was so excited when this came out. Now I'm very bored with it. You need all the stuff the other reviews said plus what I'm about to say... PLEASE MAKE IT MORE LIKE THE SIMS! The Sims is a perfect game. People have voices,it has WAY better graphics,the people are more intelligent,it has more social interactions,you should be able to choose what you say no matter what the other person says,and you should be able to talk to more people at once so you could have a 4-way alliance or even a 5-way alliance.I am very eager to see how this game turns out so don't rush it. Please don't disappoint me again or I'll be afraid to buy Infogrames products."
1,FAIL,this game fail so hard. is bear junk an monkay carp. me waan a game me cyan play pon de weekend but dis no good.
2,"Disappointed - ""Deluxe Edition"" Polar Express!!","I did't find this edition of Polar Express very ""deluxe""! The book itself measures only about 3 1/2 inches by 3 1/2 inches. I ""assumed"", which is always a mistake, that the board book would be similar in size to the hard cover edition. I think $32.00 is a very exorbitant price for this package. I'm very disappointed, but not willing to spend the shipping costs to send it back. I would not advise you to make this purchase."
5,Invertebrates Review,"Biology of the Invertebrates, Fifth Edition by Jan Pechenik, Jan Pechenik is a great book for anyone taking Invert. at the basic level, it describes different phylums, subphylums, classes, genus, and species! I took it and payed way too much for it from my school, sold it for 1/2 the price back and then bought it on amazon for like 14 dollars! I keep it and still reference to it now that I'm taking vertebrate!"
4,Great Shirt for the Gym!,Keeps me cool at the gym. Looks great. They run a little big but I would still get your normal size.
5,Unique and Interesting book!,"This book is very unique among books about Cleopatra in that the first half of the book is about her and the second half is about the fate of her children, specifically Cleopatra Selene her daughter with Mark Anthony. The book contained interesting photos of Cleopatra Selene's tomb and her likeness, she became the queen of a North African country. I read this book MANY years ago and the story was fascinating. It's a book I've searched for for a long time and am happy to have found it here on Amazon.com."
5,Fantastic,"I began reading ""Running With Walker"" after brunch one Sunday, and didn't put it down until I finished it later that evening. I hope that peple don't make the assumption, as I did at first, that this is a ""medical"" book about an illness. This is no more a book about autism than ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a book about art. This is a story about a family and how they used thier stregnth and love for one another help them to overcome adversity. Hughes puts such a lighthearted, often humorous spin on events that many would have a hard time seeing the silver lining in, and you walk away from his story feeling that you have new good friends in the Hughes Family."
5,Stories Included,"Stories included in Volume III:-Big Surprise-The Creeping Terror-Deadline-Mantage-No Such Thing As a Vampire-Crickets-Day of Reckoning-First Anniversary-From Shadowed Places-Nightmare at 20,000 Feet-Finger Prints-The Likeness of Julie-Mute-Deus Ex Machina-Girl of My Dreams-The Jazz Machine-Shock Wave-Tis the Season To Be Jelly-Interest-A Drink of Water-Therese-Prey-Button, Button-By Appointment Only-The Finishing Touches-Till Death Do Us Part-The Near Departed-Buried Talents-Duel"
1,Dreadfully boring,"I do not whatsoever recommend this book to you. It has no action in it whatsoever, and I find it very uninteresting and apathetic. However, if you enjoy the Anne of Green Gables series, you might possibly enjoy the Emily series. I do not recommend the Anne of Green Gables series either. If you enjoy books that are slow and move at a slow pace, read Emily Climbs"
5,I love Emily!,"I absolutely love the books in the Emily series, and though I love all of them, EMily Clmibs is my favorite!! I think it the funniest, with Emily having to go and live with Aunt Ruth, and put up with snobby classmates, and rumors about her and her friends. I like the touch of romance in it, with Teddy saving her from Mad Mr. Harrison. The ending leaves the reader wondering what Teddy's feelings are for EMily, and it makes one want to read the next book. I only wish LMM wrote more Emily books! And why doesn't someone make an EMily movie?? I would love to be her...."
5,The Emily books are wonderful!,"I believe that Anne and Emily are Lucy Maud Montgomery's most precious and beautiful creations. The stories are perfectly woven, they will grab you and won't leave you even long after you put down the book. These are stories to grow on, they will enlighten and enrich, and there is nothing here that will harm a young girl. In Emily Climbs, the story of Emily Byrd Starr continues as Emily goes from a little girl to a teenager in high school. Her world is changing as she grows up, but she is still the Emily we knew in the first book."
1,Not so mild horrid flowery stench,"If you are the type of person who likes to douse themselves in perfume to cover up bad BO then this is the product for you.We use World's Best Cat litter and it does smell a little but no where near as bad as it smells when this powder is added. I litterally (HAR) gag at the awful smell it produces. Sure it doesn't smell like kitty pee anymore, but that's because the perfume smell is so overwhelming it's hard to smell anything else.My b/f likes this product and thinks it smells better with it, but his nose isn't nearly as sensitive as mine."
5,aerosole sandals,"I purchased for the first time aerosole sandals about 2 years ago in a retail store, the were the most comfortable sandals I ever owned, I have problems with bunions and I need soft leather shoes and sandals that wont irritate my bunions, well I found them, Aerosole upper pace slides did it for me, I live in these sandals everyday, its like walking on a cloud, you must try, if you have any foot problems, these are the sandals, also if you are a wide width person, the medium width in these sandals are fine"
5,Fuel door cover,"It was exactly what I wanted, and it fit like a glove.It really enhances the looks of my truck.I will be getting other items."
1,Juan de Fuca---I don't think so!,"I was interested in purchasing a book about hiking the Juan de Fuca trail. Certainly, I thought a book with the name of the trail in the title would be a fountain of information. I didn't even get a drinking fountain of facts. Basically, the hikers were too tired and the weather was too stormy to do anything but hike a few miles of the 29 mile trail. LAME! Either hike the trail and give information on it or leave the trail name off the title of the book. If you are looking for information on the Juan de Fuca trail DO NOT buy this book!P.S. Selling slightly used book, CHEAP!"
3,Not the best,"It does what the advertisement promises, but not with the results I'd hoped for. Only does pulse or vibrate at three intensity levels. Heat is not adjustable at all... overall, it's ok, but I'm sure there's something better out there."
5,Interesting Time period,"I loved this book, being a great fan of time travel books - from PK Dick to Anya Seton, and her great 'time travel' novel 'Green Darkness'. and speaking of Anya Seton, her other excellent novel, based upon real characters, 'Katherine', occurs about 40-50 years after the events in Cornwall in 'The House on the Strand'. The boy King referenced in Du Maurer's book, King Edward III, is the aging King in ""Katherine"", already under the spell of his mistress with his days of glory on the battlefield behind him. I would say that Seton is superior in character development, but Du Maurer is a master at scene developement, atmosphere. Both are wonderful writers."
4,Interesting story but leaves a lot unanswered,"I really enjoyed The House on the Strand because Du Maurier made wonderful transitions between the 14th century and the present in the novel, and entwined these transitions with an interesting story line. From a scientific point of view, however, the author left a lot of things very vague in relation to the drug, possibly because it is a wild and imaginative idea to have a ""time control"" drug, but I would have preferred a little more detail. No one even mentions what this drug-weilding professor really researches throughout the novel. But, taking all into consideration, it was a very intersting book"
3,Unusual Story,"I have read many Daphne du Maurier books. As I began this book, I started to get bored with the 14th century characters. Determined to finish the book, I took special note of the unusual names and locations in order to fully understand the various plots; and I finished the book with its surprise ending making it worth the while. As everyone knows, du Maurier is a great writer. Anyone that could dream this situation up has a great imagination."
2,This book disturbed me.,"Hugh Ross decided to tackle some very BIG issues such as the trinity, the incarnation, God and Time, and free will. Unfortunately, I am uncertain to what extent scientific principles can help. Where his proposal of extra-dimensional analysis is safe, I have already read it in C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity. But much of what he writes I consider to be theologically questionable. Ultimately, the problem is that he knows physics, but he is not as well qualified as a philosopher or theologean. I would be eager to hear what William Lane Craig would have to say about Ross' theories. But I do not encourage this book primarily because it is too speculative."
2,This book was not thought through very well.,"The book reads like a poorly written high school research paper. Ross makes plenty of bold statements, but doesn't back them up with much specific evidence. As an example, Ross writes, ""God can describe all the properties of quantum particles and quantum events""(37). Where in the Bible does God explain quantum physics? Statements like this, are what makes this book's arguement weak. Ross is comparable to the Catholic church. He uses God as a crutch, to explain what science has not yet been able to prove."
1,Unforgiveable,"Yet another book that promises to support religious faith with observational evidence, and fails. Isn't there enough pseudoscience in the world?"
2,Fifty Academic Marxists Treading Water,"Insulated, tenured academic Marxists like Callari didn't lose their rudder after the cold war, they lost their keel. These essays are illuminating not because the subject matter is something we haven't heard before, but because they reveal the grumpy, cantankerous nature of self-indulgent authors who are bobbing around the ocean willing to say anything to get noticed."
1,Not what i ordered,It was not a blu-ray i recieved.I recieved a regular dvd in a clear case. Not worth the time sending it back ordered from another seller and recieved the correct movie in blu-ray
2,save yourself the trouble..,"as someone said in an earlier review, the movie is split up into two parts. the first part, training camp, was good. i enjoyed the movie up until it switches to vietnam. after that, i found it unwatchable. the main character is so annoying, i kept hoping he would get shot instead of his supporting cast. if you're looking for a good war movie, look elsewhere."
5,I like the beginning part of the movie,"I enjoy the beginning part of this movie, during the training.But the part when they go to war , It's a little bit dragging.Anyway, I usually watch the beginning part of the film, I enjoy it."
2,Not a good film,"Of all the Vietnam films Ive seen, I think this one is the most disappointing. Not the worst, but considering Kubrick is the director, the expectations automatically grow and by that measure, it is hugely disappointing. From boot camp (which actually is the best part of the film) to Nam, the film never seems to find a correct note. Maybe Kubrick was trying to make a more surreal film about Vietnam, maybe in a way a satire, Im not sure. In any case, it never really works consistently. The subject of Vietnam has produced some of the most haunting films ever, but not in this case. I would put a lot of that blame on the cast. Not once did I believe that any of these characters were real. They came off as second rate actors trying to play soldiers and that is a huge problem with the film. It needed serious actors."
1,"Very good movie, horrible DVD","Full screen and mono!? Why even make the DVD if you are not going to use any of the great features? A really good film (the first half is brilliant), too bad the DVD is such a disappointment."
5,Full Metal Jacket (1987),"Stanley Kubrick's (full metal jacket) is based from Gustav Hasford's gory & obscure novel (short-timers). A two part film,the first dealing with a marine bootcamp,and the second centering on Vietnam during the 1968 Tet Offensive. Bleak,Ironic,and perversely funny. This film offers little hope & even less humanity. The first part, is the most riveting pieces of film I've ever seen. You tend to feel numb as it fades into the second half. Making the viewer feeling a bit let down. I'ts not as strong as the first, it's a bit detached and unstructured. But I think that was the intent. The film shows a surreal view of combat. The film's climax is both suspenseful and very haunting. The last image of the marines walking through a burned out city is both bizzare and unforgettable. Superb direction,cinematography,acting, and great sound, ( the sounds of distant explosions & gunfire) are just one example. The music is both conventional and eerie. This is Stanley Kubrick's best film."
5,"Blue Balls, Crabs, and the Seven Year Itch","I've watched this Movie close to 30 times and it keeps getting better. If you think Gunny Hartman is a Drill Sergeant, or Pvt. Pyle is a Soldier then this movie might not exactly do for you, what it does for me."
3,Full Metal Jacket,"The first half of the movie was great and I'd rate it the full 5-stars. Unfortunately, the second half (after boot camp) was quite poor and I'd give it 1 star. Overall, on average I gave it 3.As one who actually went through Marine Corps boot camp in 1966, I found the performance of R. Lee Ermey real enough to set the hair up on the back of my neck. It took my back ovver 30 years and opened many memories (some goos and some not so much so) but the portrayal of Marine boot camp was as real as it gets. Once you get past the boot camp part, the movie, unfortunately, falls flat. Kubrik's portrayal of combat in Vietnam was, well, ludicrous and, having participated in the Hue City campaign. I know."
3,Yeah...,"I purchased A Clockwork Orange to add to my many DVD collection...Loved it...I mean it was original and had a good...not so sad but suspensful theme to it.Then I bought this...About the first 40 some minutes were great...An a** hole army leader that treated his troops like [...] and of course was funny as hell about it...But what upset me was he victimized the nicest guy...A well...Special guy to say the least, alright I'll say it...He victimized a retarded guy who was all around a happy nice guy and slightly overweight, not too bright...and that guy was tortured and not treated nicely..his name was Sgt. Pyle(as the leader called him), and Pyle in the movie ends up killing the leader then himself...the 2 greatest charactars of the film...Taht ruined it.Dispite that it was a good movie...not near great, but good, go get A Clockwork Orange."
5,perfection,this is my all time favorite war movie. it is powerful and shocking. i think everyone should see this and get a good cry.
5,best vietnam movie,"I thought this movie was outstanding, particularly the first half which is the best boot camp sequence to date. R. Lee Ermey gives a great performance as the drill instructor as does Vincent D'Onofrio as the ill fated pvt. Pyle. One of Kubricks best and that says a lot in itself."
4,The REAL reason this movie has a following.,"Many people who see this movie have no idea why it has a near cult following in the U.S.. In the editorial at the product site I read a comment that said: ""... he seemed out of touch with the vouge...made people wonder why he even made this film..."" True the movie didn't havce much pop-culture apeal, but it does have the loyalist constituancy any movie could ever have, the U.S. Marine Corps. Marines generally love this movie. It is one of the most true to life depictions of what we go through in boot-camp that has ever been put to screen. In the movie we all see at least a few scenes of boot-camp life we ourselves experienced."
4,Kubrick's Vietnam,"Stanley Kubrick portrays a Vietnam War experience with the entry of several young men in Marine basic training, through their fighting at Hue during the Tet Offensive in 1968. Lee Ermey provides a stunning performance as a drill instructor (he served in the Marines at one time). The Vietnam sequence is a generally accurate depiction of Hue with some impressive combat scenes. Overall a deep insight into what young men must have dealt with during the Vietnam War. Viewers will either love it or hate it."
4,A stunning work of Kubrickism...,"The first half of this Vietnam picture takes place in boot camp and those scenes only last 42 minutes. There is a lot of talk about this film and other war movies, but this is a character-driven masterpiece in smaller way, and it has perhaps the best anti-war plea in the form of Private Pyle and his climatic condition. Ex-D.I. Ermey is no Jack Webb-he is just a whole lot better. A shocking, ironically twisted black comedy that isn't faithful to Hasfard when it doesn't need to be."
3,How it was in recruit training,"The movie is basically two stories, the first half covering boot camp and the second half being just another war movie. 5 stars for part one, 2 stars for part two. That said I never thought I'd live to see Marine Corp recruit training portrayed in a movie as dead on realistic (in the 60's at least) as this was. You had to have gone through it to really appreciate it though. The opening scene got it exactly right. Part one made the movie for me. Semper Fi R. Lee Ermey!"
3,fair . . . and definately not Kubrick's best,"""Full Metal Jacket"" . . . it was good, but where did Stanley Kubrick mess up on this number?i am a HUGE Stanley Kubrick fan, and i own many of his films, but not this one. i rented it, and was suprised to say that i was not what i expected. it's not a bad DVD, but it just wasn't good.""Full Metal Jacket"" is about a group of Marines in Vietnam. the first half consists of their brutal basic training, under the iron fist of the merciless Sgt. Hartman, brilliantly portrayed by Lee Ermey.the second half takes place in good ole 'Nam, where our friends are battling an unseen enemy. i loved the first half, but the 'Nam part was poorly-made and rather bland. if you want the greatest war film, check out ""Platoon"".if you want to see a good movie, check out ""Full Metal Jacket"". it's not good, but worth seeing. the action scenes are horribly photographed, and the screenplay of banal and dark. better luck next time, Stanley"
3,Excellent movie - poorly crafted DVD,"This movie is excellent. I don't think I need to expand upon the numerous reviews which state this very same thing. I do, however, want to point out that I was sorely disappointed to see the movie only released as standard (1.33) format and not widescreen. As extras go, this DVD falls short here too. For a ""Collector's Edition"" I expect to see more depth behind the movie. I know Kubrick is dead but I'm sure there are numerous interviews with him, the author of ""The Short Timers""(dead as well) and the auhor of the screenplay. More information about why the movie was split the way it was. Why didn't it cut between incidents at boot camp and the war? So many questions are left unanswered by not including an interview into the making of the movie and the writing of the screenplay that I have to give this particular edition a thumbs down."
3,"Great Movie, Horrible Audio","This is one of my all time favorites, I couldn't wait to get it on DVD, what a disappointment to find that it is totally in mono !"
3,"Content - Good, Execution - Pretty Bad, but...","These filmmakers could have benefited from a thorough study of Frank Schaeffer's ""Addicted to Mediocrity."" From the standpoint of excellence in film-making, the movie was bad. However, in the scheme of life, there are worse things than being poorly entertained. And unlike some very well done, richly cast, and riveting movies that encourage revenge, patriotism over virtue, greed, intellectual pride, and other benign looking poisons, I think that despite the puerile acting and lack of sophistry, it was worth watching. My boys, ten and eight, enjoyed it. And according to them it had a wholesome message."
2,Very disappointing,"Was disappointed with this series. We finished it, expecting the entire time that its story line with pick up a bit, and the perfomances of the actors would improve. The characters were not interesting, and at times (esp. Branaugh's character) came across immature, silly, and unintelligent, if not simply a heel. Got a bit annoying.Island At War, Foyle's War, etc., would be a better choice, if you're interested in this sort of period piece."
3,The Levant Trilogy,"The book is in good shape and came in good time which I really appreciated. I have almost finished reading it and like very much. Also, wanted to read it as I had already read The Balkan Trilogy. Both quite good. Thanks for the good service."
2,Don't Bother Buying,"I bought this for my 10 year old son's room. I wanted to use it to hang his clothes and for extra space. The clothes hangers don't fit. You have to purchase small hangers,(it's not wide enough). The draws are roomy but the bottom of the draws are cardboard, also the back of the armoire is cardboard. It does look nice when it's put together. But it is very flimsy and wobbly. I do not trust this in my son's room. This is not made for a childs room. Take my advise and don't buy it. It is not worth $299.00"
3,It's only ok.,"I bought this 7 months ago, the pictures were super cute. It ends there. My husband put it together and fussed the entire time, asking who wrote the instructions? A child? He was better off putting it together with out them. Also the left door hinge does not work right, I'm not sure exactly what is wrong with it but the doors are not level, and when you open the left on it opens the drawer under it because it rubs it. There was nothing inside to hang clothing on. We had to get an expandable rod and put that in there and then add a board on each side to keep it from sliding down from the clothes. The materials it is made out of is not as sturdy as it says in the reviews. All and all I am NOT happy with this product, or any of the stork craft aspen line! It may be a great price and super cute in the pictures, but please keep looking!"
4,Very nice as a gift for babies or children,"I bought this as a gift for a niece turning one. The size and type of fastener (screw, not pressure plate) were ideal for this particular setting. The gems look nice and the recipients were satisfied with the quality. I would say it was good value for the price."
5,Rocking Work-out Music!,This CD is excellent for a fast-paced workout. Really gets you moving. I love it!
5,"Fantastic for IBS, great-tasting & portable!","I love this product, and use it every single day. I chew two tablets, three times a day, with a half-liter bottle of water per dose, and they help my IBS sooooooooooooooo much. I find them very pleasant-tasting, and I don't find them chalky, at all, but then that's never been a thing that's bothered me about an item. This is a very good price, here at amazon, and since our Vitamin Shoppe will no longer be carrying them in-store, I will now be ordering them here, thru amazon. If you have IBS, try these... they are fabulous."
2,ah... not again,"Ok, knew these were not going to be the greatest. Talking about fiber here. I purchased the chocolate, thinking it would help. Well not really. They left a really weird after taste and really hard to choke down. I tried eating one at a time and drink a lot of water to rinse my mouth out before I ate the other. Than I tried eating two at the same time just to get it over with...bad idea. It got to the point that just looking at them turned my stomach. Won't be buying these again. I will try the sprinkle fiber, that way it will be mixed in with my food and easier to eat. Not going to give it a one star because it is fiber and a good way to get more in your diet. However, not more than two stars just because for me they were hard to choke down."
1,A cherry Icee is more fun,"The only redeeming value is the Pamela Anderson look alike. Her implants have to be the perkiest two things this side of the Swiss Alps.A movie loaded with loop holes and bad acting, it is propelled by it's dull awfulness. Only the pamela type girl has any acting sense."
3,"Great Plot, But It Needs More Action","Frank, Joe and Chet fly off to the California desertland to search for a man who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Did he leave by his own choice or was he kidnapped? Also, Mr. Hardy investigates a group of criminals who are counterfeiting government checks. I thought that this book had a very good plot, it was fairly well-written, the events moved along quite well and there was quite a bit of interaction between the Hardys and the criminals during the course of the book. However, I found that the book could have used a bit more action and that, while I did enjoy the book, it never completely grabbed my interest to the point where I didn't want to put it down. I would recommend reading this book, but while most fans would probably like it, few probably would say that they absolutely loved it."
4,Very good,"Not as brilliant and fast paced as the very best of the Wolfe's, but once it gets rolling there's plenty to enjoy."
4,Ball of Fire,"Aw shucks. It's Barbara Stanwyck and The Coop. Forget the rip off lack of extras and the definitely shoddy/mushy quality of the copy: it's The Miss for Heavens' sake! It's about great film and great acting, about one of filmdom's most under-rated -Barbara Stanwyck- and and one of it's often over-rated - Gary Cooper (very good, yes, but compared to La Stanwyck: give me a break!!). This is an enduring bit of whimsy, an intelligent and witty film. I first saw it in 1966, when I was 14 years old. Decades later, I find it is still delightfully fresh and timeless. I waited for a decade for this copy to become available on dvd; forgive me for being grateful!"
3,A Stanwyck Hit,"Very cute movie; a bit unrealistic, but cute. Barbara Stanwyck's comedic talents are superb. However, I do think Gary Cooper was miscast as a brilliant professor. His acting is stilted and vocabulary way beyond what is expected from a sheriff protecting his town in High Noon. The rest of the cast is hilarious and lovable. This movie is worth a watch and a chuckle."
2,HANES tear out the A## hole.,I'm looking for a new brand. I haven't tried these others. See the Butt Hole blow Out Underwear video on you tube b29349 Hanes are paper thin. FOTL is the only one worse.
3,Good product. Way overpriced.,I have no problem at all with the quality of the product. My problem is that I saw the same thing last night at Walmart for $9.97.
4,Feel great & taste great,"If you like the feel of tighty wighties, but don't want to look & feel like an idiot, I highly suggest these. The fabric is super soft and they almost never ride up. They are worth every penny.I can't tell you how many I have purchased because my dogs seem to think they are super tasty too!"
3,"Average, mid-quality brief determined not to ""ride up""","These briefs advertise a ""no ride up"" quality (a definite bonus!) and after trying them on, I could see why: the fit on the thigh is quite tight. I ordered a medium and I have average thigh thickness, but these didn't feel particularly comfortable. If the lower thigh portion had more elasticity, this wouldn't be a problem, but there was little ""give"" in this area. The fabric itself is average quality and actually a little rough. I was looking for a tighter woven, softer feel that I've become accustomed to with Calvin Klein and some of the Jockey boxer briefs. On the plus side, the waist band is soft and comfortable and the pouch has an airy yet slightly snug ""cup"" feel. Also, considering the price, these aren't a bad value, so for the less-picky (not me) these may work just fine."
1,Shame,"This story is so stupid, especially since it is suppose to be based on a true story. First off, Indians didn't have princesses. That was one mistake she made with me. If I'm not mistaken this book is a sequel to I forget which book. I remember in the end Snow Deer comes to live with her father and his white wife. So why the heck would Snow Deer father get upset that she loves a white man when he loves a white woman? Cassie Edwards romanticizes Native American culture so much that she makes her great great-grandfather a chief and her great grandmother a princess. Give me a break. She could've kept this story. Her characters like all her characters are never developed and weak which is a shame since this story is about her own great -grandmother."
2,Turns into a bust,"I purchased this DVD player, my first DVD player, because I was told it was really good and had been happy with my other Sony products. Boy was I disappointed. The picture quality was good, the sound was terrible and 7 months after I purchased it the carousel stopped working. I would put in a DVD and the machine would not register it was there. When I picked up the machine I could hear parts moving around in it. The sound was so terrible I would have to turn the volumn all the way up on my Sony TV just to barely hear the movie. When I called Sony about it they told me I would have to pay for all repairs. I traded it in for a less expensive single disk Sony DVD player. My new one works much better. Sony makes some good products. This one, however, was a bust."
1,"after using them, I have to change opinion","earlier I gave these five stars because we liked the way they felt in use, and the pattern. However after using a set for less than three weeks, the pattern has begun to fade! Talk about a shock! Just average use for such a short period and it appears the pattern just rubs off...These were also handwashed only!I couldn't recomment this set at all, since you buy it for the appearance, primarily. A big thumbs down!"
1,this song is so unbelievably terrible,"What is with this song? It has toddlers with helium in their system singing in the background. I actually laughed at this song because it was so stupid. And a ""boo""? What the heck is that? This is probably the dumbest song that I have ever heard in my lifetime."
4,Latin America's Economy,"This book is probably one of the most widely used for classes on Latin American Economic Development. It is well-structured and combines a revision of the main historic events that had impacted the economic development of Latin America with alternative theoretical explanations. It gives special priority to topics such as inflation, debt crisis and poverty and inequality that are crucial for the understanding of the Latin American economic evolution. Moreover, the text does not forget about the role played by the interaction between politics and economics. In this sense, the chapter on populism is remarkable. However, many of the statistical tables are outdated and in my modest opinion, a future revision of the book should include a chapter on the neoliberal reforms and their consequences."
3,"Good history, but outdated","This book serves as a good history of Latin America's economic history until the late 1980s. Of course, given its publication in 1995, not much more could be expected. However, if you are looking for a good understanding of Latin America's main eocnomies, it is not sufficient, since the changes that most countries have faced in the 1990s and early 2000s are dramatic. For example, there is very little in this book dealing with privatization (the wave that hit the region in the early 1990s), or even the control of inflation and the (limited) opening of markets to international trade.Given all that has happened since its publication, it is good history, but does not reflect the current reality."
5,Easy to Deal with,"just as described, and packaged well. Arrived on time and in perfect condition very easy to deal with all the way around."
2,Shrunken Briefs,"I have used these briefs before and have washed them in warm water and dried them in warm/cool dryer, which proved to be good. For some reason these recent ones shrunk more than they should have. They became too short in highth.The seller finally replied but did not offer any compensation.I had bought 4 three packs of briefs all a waste.[ASIN:B00062WSNO Calvin Klein Men's Basic Brief, 3-Pack]]"
1,"Nothing concrete, too high-level for a mortal to benefit.","I read the book a year ago when it happened to be the only such book out there. My comment, simply put: it doesn't worth your time. if you don't know what EAI is about, you will still be so after reading it; if you already know a little bit, you won't know more.My recommendation: read the book ""IT Architecture and Middleware"" from Chris Britton instead, which is the only non-nonsense book under this subject I have encounted so far.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
2,"One to rent, not own","A decent read. Interesting in some parts, boring in others. Mr. Lanyi's background is unusual and he does have a good sense of humor. Overall, I would say it is more a book to take out of the library than a book to buy."
4,Saddle Up for Good Listening,I've listened to these stories about three times in the last two years. It's Louis and that means well written. I enjoy the full cast of voices on these productions.
3,mystery book mystery,this book was pretty good but the first time i read it i was confused but overall its great.
4,Very unique ninja anime,"This is one of the most well-known anime existing, and for good reason; this is truly a unique piece of work. You have a vagabond ninja named Jubei Kibigami who is forced to fight the eight devils of Kimone, led by a man whom Jubei had killed once already. Accompanied by Kagero, a woman immune to poison, and Dakuwan, a crackpot from the Tokugawa government, Jubei begins his quest. The artwork and animation are fantastic, and the fight scenes are unique since each devil has a certain ability and a certain weakness as a complement to that ability. The final showdown is the best part of the movie, as it should be. The dubbing is very good too.On to the bad stuff: the plot can drag at times, even though it usually picks up at just the right time. The uninspired ""ancient Japanese"" music melded into the background, and many scenes could definitely have used a cool tune. Gore and all-around oddity are rampant. Worth a watch."
5,ninja scroll,"This is perhaps one of the best japanese animations to date. I have not seen any that come close to the action, dialogue and drama in this video. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to find good japanese animation."
5,the best ever.,"If you watch ninja scroll for the first time ,you will realise that all others do not compare. I have seen it 11 times and it just gets better. A small piece of advice do not watch ninja scroll untill you have seen the others first or you will be displeased that you did.Nothing compares to ninja scroll."
4,"Great action film, but it's definitely not for kids!","I recommend this to anyone who seriously likes anme. If you don't, the vulgarity of the movie might seem a little odd. It's not for anyone under the age of 15!! There's a sex scene, rape scene (kinda sorta), and nudity. But don't get me wrong! The plot's great! have fun with it!"
1,Overrated Sexist Bloody Flick,"You have animation in this movie......that's about it. Picutre 'Samurai X' (aka Kenshin OVA) with no plot...completely unnecessary sexual scenes....pointless and immoral bloodshed....and you have Ninja Scroll.I don't know why they even bother to make this as good sounded as it is. The Blind Man fight was the only decent fight in the whole thing, everything else either made me nautious or disgusted.If you're into pointless and mind-numblingly-dumb violence and rape, pick up Ninja Scroll. If you want something redeeming and having ENTERTAINMENT value, go for Samurai X or Princess Mononoke.Otherwise, bleh...save your money for a bat to hit yourself with when you read reviews praising Ninja Scroll..."
5,Nice,"This is an ultra violent Ninja sword fighting beat em up fest, if your a fan of Manga and martial arts, you should check this out, the story is perhaps a little confusing, and as I have stated before in other reviews I HATE dubbed versions, but the dubbed version of Ninja Scroll is passable, they have the voices right and they haven't chewed the plot up. The fighting is ultra fast and furious and extremely dangerous, real 'don't try this at home or else you will lose a limb' kinda fights, and most fights in this movie people do! really well designed characters in this movie, and the animation is smoother than a babies behind. A must for Manga action fans."
5,It's about...time!,"...There really is nothing new that this movie brings to the table in terms of story. But that's not what makes it special. Yoshiaki-san has found a way to blend two popular genres, action and feudal japan, in the realm of anime. Let's face it, a movie of this graphic a magnitude just wouldn't cut it in live action. Plus, sometimes it's just more fun to watch it animated.One warning, though. If you are faint of heart of stomach, or have a weak constitution all around, and haven't seen this movie, it is best that you keep it that way. ... this movie still stands as one of the most violent OAV to ever come out of Japan. Still, if you're feeling up to a little animated mayhem, I definitely suggest giving Ninja Scroll ninety minutes of your life. You shouldn't regret it."
4,A Well Made Story and Anime!,"Ninja Scroll is a very well made movie. The animation in it is fantastic. The battles with the Devils were very exciting. Each one had a weakness and strength. The music was good but nothing that really stood out. The story however is very well devoloped and you're introduced to the characters quickly. However there were a few scenes that were put in that seemed pointless. For example, the sex scene with the master ninja. Overall this movie was very good and I believe an (older) anime fan should add this to his/her collection. Warning: Lots of gore and nudity."
5,The Only Anime comparable to Akira!,"This movie is both great animation and storywise with its detailed plot and great action scenes. Although, we've had heros like Jubei before, he is a welcome addition. If u don't have it, get it. This is sure to be one of the classics"
1,El lame-o movie-o. This anime is disappointing.,"I don't know what you guys are talking about. I saw this movie. The story was ludicrous. The artwork is poor. ""HellCity"" had a more interesting story. Old anime like ""Project A-ko"" had much better artwork. ""Ranma 1/2"" is funnier. This anime really stank."
5,Simpily Amazing Anime.,"A lone ninja named Jubei goes after a army of evil demonic creatures and dismembers them into pieces. entertaining, brilliant and stunning yet very gory. a Must have in any Anime collector's collection alongside Akira and Ghost in the Shell.Recommendations: The Patriot ( Mel Gibson), Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness, Fist of the North Star."
5,Best there is!,This anime may not be sexual or sexy kinda but this has to be the best action anime in the world. Its very original and the plot is great all exept the end is flawless so in my book this is a 5 star. peace homes
5,"Ninja Scroll was originally formatted in 4x3, Not Widescreen.","I see alot of misinformation being spread on here about Ninja Scroll being originally formatted in widescreen, that is simply not the case. The movie was always in 4x3 format, even when it originally was seened in movie theaters in Japan.On to the Blu-ray, the movie has never looked better, you see a level of detail that wasn't seened in previous releases.All in all, a must buy.Sentai Filmworks did a excellent job with this release, and hopefully they can get the license to Vampire Hunter D, and Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust and put those on Blu-ray as well."
5,"This is an Excellent, a Classic","Jubei is a true hero in the classic term. He is dashing and charming and witty and too bad he is an anime! A lovely, strong heroine, and several really nasty guys round out this wonderful story line. The animation is great and so is the dubbing. One of the first animes I ever watched, and one that helped claim me as a fan. Not exactly what you would want to watch in front of your kids as there a few sexual situations and a bit of nudity and gore. Overall this is a near perfect film and I kept forgetting that it was animated. You feel like everyone in it is real. A must-see, especially for someoen who is not yet an anime fan. This one will suck ya in!"
3,"5 for the movie, 2 for the dvd.","This is an awesome movie. All the characters are realistic in their emotions and you really feel for some of them (especially Kagome). The plot twist of Jubei gets poisoned (not a spoiler, happens ten minutes into it) is a cool countdown plot. Though the animation is outdated, it looked good when i so about 3 years ago. But, the dvd is TERRIBLE! Of course, I expect this from Manga now.The features are nice, but the quality of sound and picture is horrible. It's like a VHS copy. Overall, good movie, bad DVD."
5,Awesome Animated Martial Arts Movie!,"If you love Japanese anime and Hong Kong martial arts movies, you gotta see this movie. The animation is excellent and the action is fierce. I would recommend this movie for mature audiences only because of the violent content and some sexual depictions, this movie isn't like Street Fighter II The Movie. I haven't seen any martial arts manga as good as Ninja Scroll. So it's a classic far as I'm concerned."
2,Limited appeal,"Ninja Scroll depicts gory cartoon violence, sexual sadism and villains with supernatural powers. Using sufficient suspension of disbelief, the story becomes enjoyable."
5,"Wonderful, as expected",Mary Jane Holmes' books are predictably good reading. I agree with other reviewers in classifying her style as a slightly less witty American version of Jane Austin. This particular volume has had the most well defined story line of the three Holmes' books I have read so far. I love the way the author delves into the deep moral struggles of her main characters and the wonderfully developed supporting characters.
2,"Unnecessarily complicated, and it skips","This boombox is besieged with buttons - one to turn it on, another to select the mode (CD, cassette, AM, FM), play and pause buttons (two sets!), as well as toggles for bass quality and mode programming. The complexity makes no sense for a simple boombox, and this unit certainly doesn't have the sound quality to rate as a sophisticated unit. Additionally, the CD portion skips at the slightest quake, making it difficult to move about in the room in which it is placed."
2,Sloppy wet ears.,"I bought these bowls specifically because of the reviews from spaniel owners saying it kept ears dry. Fail. Sopping wet ears.The bowls are super cute, though."
2,UNSTABLE,"I have cocker spaniels and wanted to try this set. I ripped the box open in great anticipation to find that the frame is off balance. The 4 legs don't sit on the floor at one time. Maybe it's a defect, but for now, I'm disappointed. I really can't use it."
5,If you've got a long eared dog,"then this is the set of bowls you need. Now my english cocker keeps his ears cleaner, and my floors drier as his ears now don't flop in his bowl and slosh water everywhere. Also doesn't slid across the floor like traditional bowls, which is a good thing when you have 2 children under the age of 5."
5,Very realistic to real movie character!,"I got this because he was another character that I liked. He is very stable and durable. He is a little more then 6 inches tall when his head is all the way up. He comes with a stand so he can be displayed. His tail, legs, arms, and head spin and move around. Very detailed and highly recommend!"
4,Very Visual!,"A visually stimulating story based on the true story of his ancestors who perished in the Famine. Having been to Strokestown and the Famine Museum, I was able to picture in my mind's eye how Strokestown would have looked and what went on during this darkest period in Irish history. I highly recommend it."
2,where is the text?,"While Kramer's theories and interpretations are truly interesting and provide good material for scholarly research and thought, the book has one major flaw: poor quotation of the texts themselves. If one can find other translations or read the originals themselves, one starts to wonder if Kramer is reading the same materials. Should be read as general information by specialists but not for the layperson or for anything beyon inspiring further research."
2,Very Disappointing,I was hoping for help in redoing my livingroom but found that this book doesn't take into account that you may have a television in your living room. Seems like it was geared to much more expensive homes than my level.
1,Not Helpful,"This book was a big disappointment. I learned nothing from it, it has boring black and white photos, and Ms. Ward has too many ""rules"". If you want a boring room, follow the advice in this book."
2,Dissappointment...,"I ordered two books to read on interior rearrangement; I needed some guidelines to follow. The first book was this one, and the other book was ""Decorating for Good:.."" by Carole Talbot - a far better book. I like to attack things from a logical set of rules and this book does not offer it. Caroles book offers a set of guidelines to lead you in a direction that is flexible, but has a strong underlying foundation. I read Caroles book first and I loved it,but I was totally dissappointed after reading this one. Too constrictive and opinionated. The pictures are good, but you have to figure it out for yourself, how she came about the solutions she did."
1,nothing new here,"This was just ""furniture rearrangement 101"". Not a thing here that a person with half a brain could not come up with on their own. Very disappointed in this book, it would be better as a an article in a magazine."
4,Good common-sense decorating guidelines,"This is the book I've been looking for ... the one that tells me the design guidelines for furniture placement, accessories, etc. There isn't a lot of mumbo jumbo and hype; just common sense advice for real people"
5,So useable and practical!,"This book is so appliable and made you want to get started, doing something! You're advised to read thru the entire book, but I didn't. Since we have some pretty heavy pieces, fairly small rooms and rent an apt. there wasn't a lot to do but what I did was fun and made a pleasant difference. Try it, you'll like it!"
4,Reality Decorating,"Unlike so many of the interior decorating books on the market, this one stays within the realm of the real world and gives good practical advice on how to make a room full of furniture work. The before and after shots of each room, along with a list of what she banished or bought, are fun to study. While I thought she goes a little overboard on the need to have two matching items in the room, Ms. Ward is a good guide for normal klutzy homeowner who just wants a few ideas on how to make a room look better."
5,I loved this book and my friends keep borrowing it!,"I love this book and was thrilled when I found out there was another one.I have re-arranged my living room a couple of times, reduced the clutter and hung my pictures at better heights.A friend borrowed it and fixed her (very small) living room. It had been cramped and uncomfortable, now it's very nice. Her daughter used it when re-vamping her room (now lime green and black - she's a teenager) It looks great.I finally got it back (I'm a little possesive about it) and then it was borrowed again. I've heard nothing but good things about the help it provides in basic room arrangement.I agree that if you want colour and Home Beautiful then this is not the book for you. It doesn't pretend to be."
5,Super,"I'm a newlywed and this book saved my life. We bought some very nice things when we got married two months ago, but I have hundreds of what I guess you would call knicknacks I collected over my lifetime I will never part with. Then there were all the wedding gifts. I had no idea how to arrange all my ""treasures"" without making a small room look even tinier. Once everything was unpacked, it looked awful. This decorating book changed everything. I never thought of using corners the way they show you, and I never thought my collections could look so beauitiful. I didn't even have to put a single piece away. Even my husband couldn't get over it. I recommend this book very highly to everyone. I think it would also make a terrific wedding gift, or a gift for someone who's moving."
4,"Las Palmeras, Alberto Cortez","El disco está bueno. hay una que otra canción que no conocía, sin embargo escuchar a Alberto Cortez recompensa, sobre todo su primera cancion que conocí Las Palmeras.El CD Llegó a tempo y el precio fue accesible para mi."
3,Used video tape,"The tape was viewable, it's a darn long tape (almost 4 hours). This tape was hard to get and I consider my self lucky to have found this one."
2,region coding miss leading,"My rating only applies to the advertising information given. The advertising material states a Reg.4 import but also a Region 2 coding, which should work in Europe, but the DVD doesn't - so make sure you have a multi regional machine or you are in a Reg. 4 zone."
4,great pick!,great game!! a little pit of an older game but if your a big fan of shooters u should own this!!
3,Its ok,"I got Timeshift for only $13 so I shouldn't complain too much. In truth its a rather good game, especially given its price. However I really wish the time powers lasted longer, especially the freeze time ability. 5 seconds is too damn stingy! Being able to upgrade the time powers so that they lasted longer would have made this game so much better.And would it have killed them to put a cheat or 2 in there for unlimited use?!?In the end I am only really disappointed in the amount of time given for each power (too little), how long it takes for them to re-charge (too long), and the fact that there are no cheats to really have fun with said powers (would have been epic).For $13 bucks though, it's worth it.Ps- if you are looking for a fun game that allows you to slow down/freeze time as much as you want, try BloodRayne 2."
2,Snore...,"Yet another boring FPS... I think that Resistance is a little better than this game but, I'm still waiting for something a little more fast paced like Unreal Tournament 3, which I plan on getting this week. This game is a better rental than a buy.. The whole time manipulation is fun for the first level, and then Timeshift just becomes another typical console FPS.."
3,not practical,"too bulky and it makes the car seat narrower than it should be. or maybe it's just that our car doesn't have enough space between the car seat and the front seat for it to work correctly. so intead of using it to level the car seat, its just there to make sure the car seat is leveled correctly so i don't have to keep checking."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT,"I had purchased this for our Mercury Mountaineer (very similar to Explorer) because my son's Britax Advantage did not positioned to a 45deg angle. I had just wasted an hour getting fraustrated because this leveler did not do what it claims to do. For one thing it did not look anything like the picture it provided and it did not have 3 different levels to choose from.Maybe it works better with the other vehicles but personally, do not waste your money and your time purchasing this so called leveler. I had purchased a foam noodle (it cost me [price]) and I do not have any problems with it."
1,Save your money!,"I tried this product in every position possible, and after nearly tearing my hair out, I finally gave up and realized that rolled towels worked much better for installing the Britax Roundabout in my Mazda Tribute. The leveler is much too big and has odd angles - it just doesn't work for us."
4,It depends really on what you want to use this book for...,"The book is inspiring if you are looking for something to motivate you in a purist woodworking way. It is not necessarily a how to book, but more of a how to approach woodworking, written in the ""old school"" philosophy of a master crafstman. Hence the title... ""The Fine Art of... "" The version of the book I have is from the 70's complete with all black and white pictures. I probably got more out of this book than others in my woodworking libray of the more expensive glossy fluff books put out by many of the current publishers looking to catch your pocket book with eye candy. There is substance to this book and not fluff. It is not a step by step guide (for the most part)."
5,a good series. the books are short and they read fast.,"The book is good. I loved some of the twists in it even though some were predictable. I'm happy to have finally gotten my hands on this series. I've been wanting to for years. They are short books being about 180 pages. They do not drag on, but are slightly suspenseful. I can read them fast and they are always interesting. I'll definitely read more of the series.thank you for your timeand feel free to comment my review,Loran"
4,A hidden stair case! CREEEEEEPY!,"This book is about Nancy Drew, a young detective. she's out to solve a mystery about a old mansion. She was told that some one, or somthing was sneaking around. Nancy's friends Bess and George are helping Nancy out on this exciting adventure. All this and much more in the book, enjoy.I liked this book becuse i love mystery and spookyness. I rated thas book 4 stars because it's not my favorite book but I love it. If you like mystery and spookyness than this is the book for you to read. NANCY DREW, YAHOO!!!!!"
2,Quality much less than expected for the price!,"The price would have been acceptable had the quality of the product been better. For example, one front corner is rounded; the other is angled off. The wood-like material feels cheap. The template for the mounting holes was slightly off. However, delivery service was good."
4,Ultimate Wave Tahiti 3D,"I couldn't wait for this one to arrive in Australia and was not dissapointed, quality of doco is great and the 3D is excellent. I.m sure there will be plenty of 3D surfing movies to follow this one. Definitely worth the purchase."
3,Good 3D But a Little Boring,"My wife and I were thinking about going to Tahiti for a vacation and I picked up this DVD for a preview. Unfortunately I didn't get what I was hoping for which is to get more excited about the decision. The quality of the DVD is great: Picture, sound, and 3D effects are all well done. The story and the narration are really bad. There is no story line to keep you watching. You don't see much of Tahiti. Even when you think you will be watching great surfing scenes, those were disappointingly short and the angles don't give you any awesome feeling. The best thing about this DVD is its price especially if you want to experience the 3D effects."
4,Beautiful VOCAL TRANCE/TECHNO/POP album from Germany,"This is a nice Vocal Trance/Techno album. It has 2 or 3 instrumentals on it, but the tracks that I liked the most were the ones that had POWERFUL FEMALE Vocals that perfectly accentuated the BEAUTIFUL MELODIES.This album is similar, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS, DJ ENCORE (Intuition) and IAN VAN DAHL (Ace) albums. Actually, It is more similar to the second one.This is a VERY Enjoyable album to listen to, and would be a Great Addition to a Good CD collection.Enjoy."
4,Decent CD,"This CD is great, it's full of catchy beats, but not overly repetitive, like some techno can be. The girls who sing for Fragma are decent, they aren't amazing, but they aren't annoying by any stretch. Chances are that if you loved Darude's CD, or Sylver, or even Madison Avenue, you'll enjoy this CD. But if you're a deep down disco fan, or you don't really like techno, just don't bother with this CD, because this is the definition of a typical good techno CD."
2,Disco Mess,"This can't be a serious recording. The thing starts out OK if you're not put off by something that screams techno-disco and shoves every old disco stereotype right in your face. But after about the first third of the album, the whole thing goes right into the toilet. To give you some idea of the last two-thirds of the thing: Imagine a music camp for 10-12 year old boys who have never had any music experience. Then after one week (and only one week) of camp the boys are turned loose on an assortment of synthesizers and drum machines. The result would be a fairly accurate representation of the last two-thirds of this album. The girls who do the so-called singing here try to salvage it by throwing in what are supposed to be (I guess)...little squeaks and grunts, but the whole thing is beyond saving. I am fairly sure the band showed up at the studio, recorded the first few songs, the somebody told them that really need more than that for an album..."
5,Converse baby shoes,"I bought these for a granddaughter a few years ago, and am now buying them for a new grandson. Cute, easy to slip on and off, can be hung on a Christmas tree, rear-view mirror or a peg in the office when outgrown."
4,These are just we expected,I bought these for my son. He loves them and feels it makes the sound quality much moreprofessional. I would recommend.
4,lethal lolita,It was the best product that i bought for the price and that i realy what it so badly.you now
5,eternal,"from the 1960's to 2001 the isley brothers survived and not just because of r kelly but other artists who sampled trheir songs, the isley's are eternal soul legends,they carry their soul-funk-ballad tradition in this soon to be classic cd. old fans, and new ones will love this compilation. p.s. r.i.p. o kelley isley."
3,It's pretty nice,"The Isley Brothers did a geat collaboration with Jill Scott on ""Said Enough"". Some of the songs ring classic Isley Brothers, yet some sound alike. Through and through this cd is nice, but I anticipated a little more."
2,Disappointing Kindle Edition,"Be cautious before ordering this Kindle edition. It was very poorly done - limited punctuation, many spelling errors, scanning issues (m versus in), etc. It makes reading a challenge and choppy. Silhouette should be embarrassed to publish this as Kindle."
1,Could you tell what the book is about?,"Writing that you love a book and that this is a great new author really doesn't tell me a blasted thing about the book. Fine, write you love the book but at least tell me what it's about."
3,"Pleasant, Pleasant, Pleasant","The previous Amazon reviewers have given this five stars. QUACKSER FORTUNE is not one of the greatest movies of all time, and not one of the near-greatest. But it's a solid film, worth seeing. The two main characters are three-dimensional, for a change. Both Kidder and Wilder are wonderful in their roles. The picture drags too much; some good editing would have helped. Also there is a bit too much of -- how can I say it? -- reverse condescension. The Irish are a bit ""quaint,"" which endears them to American audiences, I suppose, and also supplies a bit of distance. If this film were set in the US, we'd see two rather flaky people -- a do-it-alone selfish Wilder, and a silly college student Kidder. So it wouldn't work here. But set in Dublin, the trick is pulled off. Bottom line: a solid three-star film, each star standing for ""pleasant."""
3,Odonata by Amethystium,"Shipping time was excellent. CD was ok. Had purchased it for a certain song on it. It didn't have that song, even though I had looked it up on the internet and listened to the sample. CD would be fine for easy listening background music."
1,what product????,"I sure wish I could rate this product, but I never recieved it and haven't recieve a refund!!! Amazon is a terrible company. Don't Buy anything from them!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Home video footage,Looks like someone just filmed some home videos and dubbed it over with some very obnoxious music (literally). At some points there is a graphic in the corner covering up a time and date stamp from the camcorder. Very unprofessional. The martial arts aren't even that impressive. I watched it once and then never again.
4,My Time,I am really enjoying My Time. It gives a different perspective of retirement years. I would recommend any person nearing retirement to read it.
3,product shipping sucked!,"The multimeter (Extec ex510) is fine, a good product for a good price but it was shipped in a cheesy envelope with little or no protection, in late December no less. The box was thrashed, it looked like i bought it from a discount bin at the .99 store, and with only 3 days before Christmas I couldn't send it back. I will never buy from this site again!"
5,"Adorable Book, perfect for the preschool set!","We first found this book at our local library. My son loved it so much that we sought out his own copy. It is a very cute story, and easy to read. There's the melodic rhythm, combined with repetion and rhyming, it soon became a favorite in our household. It is illustrated beautifully as well. We read it almost every night. We have also read ""Bed Hog"" and loved it just as much. I look forwarding to adding other books by this author to our collection."
4,Intex surface skimmer,"This works great for getting the surface debris out of the pool. We wish it came with a finer filter inside the basket that made all the skimmed stuff stay inside the basket as you take it out to empty it. Other than that, it keeps our pool pretty clean. We're happy with it."
3,"Works, but not great for Easy Set pool","The skimmer does what it's supposed to do, but doesn't work great with EasySet pools. The hanger isn't shaped to the contour of the top ring, so it tends to move around a little. This coupled with the hose putting some force on it makes for some jacking around to get it to sit level enough that the floating basket won't bind. If the basket binds it won't float properly and water can't enter around the full circumference which reduces the effectiveness."
3,Netlik yok :(,Ayak kullanmadan kullanmak zor. Ama ayak kullanarak bile elle fokus tutturmak ya cok zor yada bu aletin fokusu bu kadar (bulank).
5,"Doctor Who's Take on ""The Thing""","This serial from the Tom Baker/ Sarah Jane years is an absolutely brilliant one. The serial's first two episodes resemble the classic horror movie, ""The Thing."" After that it resemble a sort of pre-epidemic 28 Days Later. The acting is awesome, and the characters are powerful. One of Tom's best!"
1,Disappointed,This was shipped to a friend and when it arrived it was open and he was not able to use the item I spend $40.00 for a box of nothing. So disappointed. My friend uses these all the time it would be nice to have a new one since it was a gift.
2,Not as good as NO Xplode,"I bought this because of the many reviews I read comparing this to NO xplode. If you are buying this for the same reason think again, it does not taste nearly as good as NO xplode, it leaves a funky residue in your mixer bottles, and its a proprietary blend which means it doesn't tell you the content amounts for any of the key ingredients (so its more than likely just fillers). From an energy perspective it seems ok but not as good as NO xplode. I will not buy again."
2,Don't waste your money,"Well, I felt something of an energy boost the first couple times, but basically the feeling of drinking four cups of coffee. I did notice better pumps (simply due to NO, etc..), but I think my endurance and possibly strength was actually reduced. Really doesn't do much good and I'd stick with creatine/protein. Also, as some have commented, Super Dump is probably the more appropriate name...."
1,a review by one of his students,The only reason this got any stars is because Amazon won't let me put negative. Hollinger is a douche bag and couldn't write his way out of a burlap sack.
5,Extremely enlightening!,A psychologist recommended I read this book as my daughter and I were having issues. Wow! What you'll find in this book will change your whole thinking about relationships with family members. Very enlightening as to why we all behave as we do and what affect our behavior has on the development of our children. A MUST read for every parent. I bought a copy for each of our children and grandchildren to read.
2,Why do people love this book?,"I love the Gottman books, I love ""How to Save Your Relationship Without Talking About It"", I love ""Love Languages"", I love ""Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus""... but this one?Not a classic, not that great, couldn't even finish it (read half, skimmed the rest).Ah, well - they can't all be winners!"
5,Excellent Guide for Vets,This has helped in filing for disability compensation with the VA. Provides an easy to read on how best to navigate the bureaucratic maze of this agency.
1,Disappointing Length,"I bought The Penguin Classics Library collection late last year and was as excited as a schoolboy when the pallet arrived at my doorstep. You can imagine my disappointment therefore when, after I had laid the books end to end, the length of all the titles combined nary reached 51 miles, and I found out I had ended up in a rather poor neighborhood with many, many ugly (and I assume illiterate) people. Also, when I attempted to repack to books and return the item to Amazon, I found most of them had been stolen along the route, and a dog had defecated on Tale of Two Cities near the McDonalds near Arrigo Park."
1,Beauty Dies,"I find it very discouraging, when an Author feels they must use the F word on the very first page of the novel. It stopped me cold. I closed the book. Can a book not be written without such profane words?"
3,If you like dark coffee...,"I prefer a lighter roast but the coffee was OK otherwise. This is a dark roast Columbian and I can't quibble with the quality, only that the taste seemed more ""burnt"" to me. If that's what you like, then this is the coffee for you. I decided to switch to another brand that offers medium roast."
3,"Absolutely Adorable Otter, but Sad Story","Peter Ustinov narrates the tumultuous life adventures of an adorable river otter named Tarka. It seems the grim reaper follows Tarka wherever he goes; we watch his father die in the first ten minutes of the film, followed by his mother, then see several of his brethren as hanging corpses ready to be skinned. How much do you wanna bet Tarka dies, too? Oh, and did I mention that this is billed as a family film? Yeah, if you're in the Manson Family.Still, it's recommended for fans of otters (another must have? Ring of Bright Water - also too sad)."
3,Predictable plot line + uninteresting characters = mediocre,"Boring. This book is far oversold by the reviews above. The story is passable and the aliens are not at all compelling. Better than 80% of science fiction novels, but still only passable."
5,GREAT IMAGE RELEASE!!!!!,One of my favorites from Image. Picture quality is very good with a good score. Titles all look original and I'm very pleased with this release.
2,disappointed,i hate to waste money but i did with this bag / too narrow in the knee area for me and i don't like the feel of the padded area that's supposed to be around your shoulders / its' hard
4,I was expecting more from the DVD boxset...,"The episodes are good and everything, but I was expecting more of the special features on the DVDs. Like on the third disc, that would have gaves, ect. Also, what I don't get... is why the Help Wanted episode was on the third season, when it should've been on the first season boxset."
5,"I already wrote a review for this, but..",Has anyone heard a rumor for a Rocko's Modern Life boxset? Just wondering...
5,Charming Rita Hayworth movie,What can I say? I just love this movie! This is a charming musical featuring Rita Hayworth and Larry Parks. This is a beautifully choreographed movie that deserves a better fate than the mediocre ratings the critics gave out. Rita dances and looks more stunning in color. What more can you ask for? See for yourself.
5,Great Choice,"Outstanding quality of chips and case. Only wish I had considered 1,000 instead of 500."
2,Beware of this Seller,Seller GROSSLY overstated the condition of this DVD. I hesitate to trust this Seller again and do not recomment others to do so either.
5,Corny but Fun,"Probably the best Jon Goodman movie I have ever seen. The premise is implauable to say the least, but you still manage some pretty descent laughs."
4,Raw (warts & all) version of classic Real Kids tunes,This CD gives you a different look at a bunch of tunes that were previously released by the Real Kids and John Felice's other band the Taxi Boys. worth having for the die-hard Kids fan. But no rock'n'roller should be without their classic first album.
2,A boring and understated movie,"Stalingrad was the turning point on the eastern front, but you'd never know that watching this movie. Focused largely on rivalries between German soldiers and their commanders, it largely ignores the hell of facing the Russian armies from the front trenches, foxholes, and bunkers. The valor on both sides is so understated that his movie seems to echo more of a skirmish than an epic struggle.Photography is very good and the acting also rates well. The plot, with no chapter stops or time stops, plods along aimlessly."
2,Stalingrad,"I was very excited about watching this movie, however I was a disappointed. The visuals are very good (uniforms, equipment, bombed out city, sewers, winterscape). The action sequences seemed cheap, much like an old spaghetti western, which really disappointed me. Could have been a great movie and topic."
1,What's my motivation to buy this dvd?,"Why does this dvd have an english (dubbed) soundtrack only. It was obviously made in german (like Das Boot), so why no german soundtrack available? Surely some people would prefer to watch the film in the original german soundtrack with english subtitles. But no subtitles either! What were the people who compiled this dvd thinking! Why not include the original soundtrack. Surely this was available.One of the best parts of the film, a scene showing the platoon listening to a speech by Hitler (the actual recording) over an improvised radio, also has no subtitles! So good luck to anyone who would have been interested in knowing what the speech was about.If ever there was a film that could benefit from rudimentary features like a choice of language or subtitles - this is it.Probably one of my favourate war films. Probably the worst DVD in my collection."
1,"What a biased, anti-German, hack-job this is.","I'm just glad that most of the 6th Army isn't around to see themselves portrayed in this way, Spielberg couldn't have ripped them any better."
4,Stalingrad,"This movie graphically shows the human side of this epic struggle, rather than just the military perspective."
2,Its ok.....,"I have watched at least 100 war films and documentariesfrom USA Colonial War to 1999 Iraq War. Maybe because it isa foreign film it got fantastic accolades by so many viewers.SKIP IT is my opinion. It does not have any rhymn or reason as toactually dealing with Stalingrad, the historical facts. Just ahodgepodge of events, bundled into a film, with some ridiculousmoments as to women, food, survival. Film just runs around in circlesand had I no knowledge of the historical facts of Stalingrad, this filmwould have been worse than a science fiction film on the subject.SKIP IT. Don't waste your money like I did....David"
3,Clearly written,"Although very simply and accessibly written, this manual just was not what I was looking for. I had been expecting a volume on understanding IRAs, Bonds, Stocks, 401ks and the like, and got a book on budgeting and saving Great for people who need help in that area, but not quite what I wanted."
2,Not really good,It is a book for really dummies in Finance. If u have a bit of experience/knowledge it does not worth.
3,I expected more,"As another reader posted, ""good, but could have been better."" Nevertheless, a good starter book and a easy read. Perhaps a future updated version could be more complete.For more advanced strategies, I suggest More Wealth without Risk and Financial Self Defense by Charles Givens These books will fill in the holes in Tysons book."
2,Was really disappointed with this book,"Bought it because I loved Eric Tyson's Dummies Guide to Investing. But his Personal Finance book really provided no useful information (at least for me.) The points he makes regarding credit cards, budgeting, etc. are valid - but they're mostly common sense...and not worth the purchase of the book. Do yourself a favor, and buy his other book, Investing for Dummies. Now, that bang is worth the buck."
5,Buzzmarketing is a must read,"Buzzmarketing offers a truly revolutionary way to look at marketing. By chronicling successful marketing ploys and campaigns, author Mark Hughes outlines a strategy that will garner your product publicity at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing strategies. A must read, I recommend this to anyone interested in brand development, advertising, public relations, or marketing. This title is ideal for product managers looking for creative and cost effective means to maximize marketing budgets."
3,It could be better,"A good little book with some interesting car security systems, the bad thing is there are some errors in the drawings of printed circuit boards and layouts of components.Also in the ""Basic Alarm System"" diagram the author ommited the component list, i.e. values of resistors, capacitors, transistors, etc.I was able to deduce the components from the component layout but it was for sure laborious."
4,Indeed relieves sore nipples,"I had sore, cracked nipples from excessive pumping, but I found instant relief once I used these. However if you have heavy flow, you'll find that the inserts are not absorbant enough and you will leak through the breastshell holes when you bend over. I compensate for this by inserting a nursing pad between the breastshell and my bra."
4,NO Engorement!,I started wearing these in the hospital with my third baby and they completely eliminated that painful engorging that happens. And no more leaking at the grocery store every time my baby fusses. I hated those yukky pads in my bras and always felt like I needed a shower. No more!!
3,Not all they're cracked up to be,"I was very sore with cracked and bleeding nipples during my second week of nursing. I tried these shells, and did get some relief. It was nice to have something that let my nipples air dry and did not flatten them within my nursing bra. They do provide a nice contour under clothing. The silicone backing was not as flexible as I hoped it would be, and they put too much pressure on the areola around the nipple, which was equally uncomfortable. Because of this pressure, I also tended to leak more and the foam inserts were soaked in no time. Since there are holes in the top of the shells, you run the risk of having milk leak out the top anytime you bend over. I ended up returning them to the store due to discomfort wearing them for periods longer than 2 hours, and I simply toughed it out instead."
2,I expected more,"I am just a dilettante but many years ago I found a book in the local library, I believe called 'creative orchestration,' which was extremely informative, well organized and useful. While Rimsky-Korsakov is renowned for his orchestration, this book is rather disorganized and wasn't useful to me as a beginner. Perhaps those who have already studied orchestration and would like his thoughts on it would find this useful or interesting but I gave up reading after a chapter or so. The price is right though, for the ebook."
4,Niandra Lades &usually just a t-shirt,"I think you have to have two qualities to fully enjoy this album, you have to be a john frusciante fan and you have to be open minded in music. Being both I found the album really good, but lets face it, this dude cant really sing that well on this cd, you have to keep in mind that he was heavily involved with heroin at the time. It is a very raw form of music, very unpolished, but that gives it some originality. If your looking for a chili peppers album you had better skip this one, but for anybody looking for true artistic expression pick it up."
4,Different,"This album is as far from RHCP as you could ever get. I first bought this years ago expecting to hear John singing songs like 'Tiny Dancer' and 'Castles made of sand' which were Johns favourites around the time of his demise with the chili peppers. But what I found was so completely different it took me a few listens to get this album.To hear a man so isolated from the world and so consumed by his addiction is upsetting, and scary to think that this could have been how we remembered John. But this album will certainly move you, and you can certainly feel his loneliness. The guitar playing is still brilliant, the words are painful and the production is poor. (I believe it was recorded on a 4 track recorder in Johns bedroom).This album you will either love it or hate it. But once you get it, and understand it you will love it.To all John fans - get this album!!!To all RHCP fans - give it a try!!!To everyone else - best leave this one alone."
3,True stories!,"This little book presents a series of tales from the seven seas, the best of which include a very interesting account of cannibalism due to shipwreck on a desert island, and story of the disaster of the Lexington. All the stories include only the original narrative, and therefore the language is at times very old fashioned, but overall this adds to the originality and the general appeal. Not all the stories, in my opinion, are worth reading, but some are striking."
4,Emotional movie..,I like this movie because it shows how much can really change in your life with just one incident. Things can change so quickly and we never really think it can happen to us. I would recommend this movie to teens and older.
3,Good classic fantasy,"This book as a fun read, but lacked a little of the magic of the first book, ""Another Day, Another Dungeon."" But it was still quite lively and a good throwback to a more classic style of fantasy."
1,DVD was from incorrect region,"My order of The House of Spirits was quite disappointing. My book group had read the book, and we were looking forward to viewing the DVD. The local video rental shop did not have a copy in stock, so I ordered it from Amazon with over-night shipping. It arrived the day prior to our meeting, but I never opened the DVD until the night of our viewing. It wouldn't play. Reason? It was formatted for a different region of the world. We (the U.S. - and Canada) are region 1, and somehow we were sent a DVD that played only in a different region of the world. Quite frankly, I'm concerned that future DVD purchases may have the same difficulty. I can't understand how a product shipped from a location within the U.S. to another location within the U.S. would be formated for a completely different region of the world."
2,the format was wrong from what was advertised. very disappointed,I was very disappointed as the format was 4:3 instead being in its original widescreen format. The Amazon description was doe widescreen and I reported the error a few times.
1,WARNING!!!,"I LOVE this film, I've seen it now many time over!!! However, all U.S. customers MUST be warned, this DVD will NOT play on most DVD players due to regional limitations!!! Please Amazon, you MUST fix the problem!!!"
2,Booooring!,"Not a very good movie for either of the stars. Story line is hard to follow sometimes, a rather long boring movie."
5,Self-Actualization Creatiity Theory in Action,"I read this story to college students when teaching Maslow's concept of self-actualizing creativity. This is the story of a seemingly ordinary little girl who grows up and crafts a life that is, for her time, quite extraordinary. Miss Rumphius is a wonderful role model of curiosity, confidence, stewardship, and mentoring."
5,A wonderful parable about stewardship.,"This is one of my favorite books to read to children. Wonderfully illustrated, it is a very compelling story about a girl on a quest to see the world, live by the sea, and make the world more beautiful. It takes a lifetime for her to accomplish her goals, particularly the third, which is the hardest of all. She accomplishes this goal not once, but twice. The story leads to great discussions with kids about our obligations to our world and each other."
3,Still ended up bottlefeeding.,"Not sufficient to help baby latch. Still have to bottle feed her. Nice that there are products for this, but didn't meet my need."
1,Waste of money,Bought these and used it for one day. Found that it wastes a lot of breastmilk and it doesn't actually help with the inverted nipples. Would rather express my milk out to save the wastage.
4,works great,"I didn't use them until I had the baby and was home for a week or so. I was having problems with the baby latching on and the doctor said it could be because my nipples were inverted. I tried these shells and they really worked great. The only thing is that you have to make sure you check them from time to time because they do collect a good amount of milk. If you leave them too long, you'll wind up leaking through. Definitely wear a loose shirt because you can tell that you are wearing something underneath if you have a tight shirt on. Also, watch how you hold the baby with them on. They are a bit hard so you don't want to lean the baby over them in a bad position. It would be uncomfortable for him."
1,Nauseating,This has to be one of the most annoying songs I've heard in my life. How can anyone like this garbage? My former roommate used to play this song all the time. Bland lyrics and an even blander beat. It's no wonder I haven't heard this one played very much. Amber makes the Spice Girls look like Pink Floyd.
4,Average value of each feature,"I bought this pen four years ago and it has served me well.Pros- Relatively light weight for everything that it is.- Laser pointer is very visible in medium light from across the room.- LED Flashlight is effective in very dim lighting for about 9 feet.- Ink has never refused to write on any typical surface.- The clip STILL hasn't broken off or bent (That's record for me)- Stylus is soft enough to not scratch my screen.Cons- Batteries have a short life. I spent $12 at Walmart to replace the four batters each time, until I found four for $3 on Froogle.- The buttons get pressed too easily accidentally. It is common for the laser point to be running for hours until I notice it in my laptop bag.- Ink is short lived but not too expensive to replace."
5,This is the Best Book in the World,"Turn Homeward, Hannalee is a wonderful book. It is very informational and teaches alot about the Civil War while it is also exciting and never dull. With her father dead and her brother in the war, Hannalee is separated from her mother and makes a promise to return home. Disguised as a boy, she struggles to return home to her mother. This is an amazing book that without any doubt I would suggest to read."
2,Didi Seven,So far this product has either not worked at all or took the color out of the fabric while leaving the stain in place. I have not tried it on something fresh so that may be part of the problem. I will use it again on a fresh stain. If that doesn't work then out it goes.
5,Listening to God,i had long been wanting to know what is comtemplative prayer. I had read many books about it but they just confused me. Jan Johnson showed me what it really means to pray contemplatively. She also challenged me t oadot this kind of prayer in my daily life. I have done so and GOd has blessed me mightily since then.
4,Good Material but Lacking ....,"This is a good compilation and a must have for Cuban music enthusiasts. However, the quality of the recording is not very good. I think the recording company could've done a better of job of cleaning the tracks with the new technology that exists today."
2,[inexpensive] but not very good,"While this stereo is priced well (usually [$$$]), you do get what you pay for. The buttons are not easy to use by touch only. To get from FM radio to play a cd you must push the source button 5 times! There should be a ""play"" button to go straight from radio to CD. Also, if you use a cell phone in the car, don't get this radio. The radio is not shielded so you will get interference from cell phone. Each time I use my cell phone I have to turn the radio all the way off. Lowering the volume does not help. You still get a loud buzzing sound. I didn't have this problem with my previous stereo. Also, cd's tend to skip for no reason. Even when driving on a smooth road, all cd's will skip."
3,"Disappointing: interesting projects, poor visuals","I bought this book on the strength of its projects - it contains some interesting designs that range from jewelry to tiny baskets to ornaments for the home or Xmas tree. My main complaints about the book are the abysmal quality of the photos and the incompleteness of the directions.Not only are many of the projects photographed on very busy backdrops, but the photos are so blurry and badly printed that I find it very hard to see how some of the connections and shapes are made--this is especially annoying since the how-to directions are neither well-written nor complete, so I am having to refer to the photos to try and guess how some of the construction steps are supposed to be done. Not recommended."
5,Teens: Under the Influence,"This book is ""the"" book for any parent wanting an understanding of the process of destruction alcohol does to their child.As the founder of a non profit organization dedicated to providing education, support and resources to parents (parentshelpingparents.info) who have just learned that they have a child abusing alcohol and/or other drugs. I found that this book did the best job in providing parents with the all the information they need and preparing them for creating a new direction for their child. For this reason, Our board of directors selected this book to provide to families.Never give up, always have a plan.Pat Nichols, ChairParents Helping Parents, Inc."
4,It meets all expectations - Good Purchase,"I only bought a Bluetooth so it would be easier to talk on the phone when I'm in my car. I've had it for over a month and still have no complaints. The ear-piece fits fine. The sound quality is good. I always leave it on and so far battery life seems pretty good - I only have to charge it every 3-4 days. So overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend to others."
1,Version en español (Spanish version) es desastrosa.,"No compres este libro en español. Es una traduccion desastrosa. El traductor decidio traducir literalmente palabra por palabra y toda la exquisitez del libro en ingles se convirtio en BASURA. Si sabes un poco de ingles, lee la version original en ingles."
4,So Devoted,"I have always loved John McLaughlin's music. So when they rereleased his album, Devotion, I was sure to pick one up. I have always enjoyed the hard blues rock sound of the album with songs like ""Purpose of When"" and the inevitable ""Devotion'. It is a quality pick up, even if you still own it in vinyl!!!"
3,Recounts Sinful Attitudes that Limit God,"This book recounts Biblical examples of how wrong attitudes can limit God. These include disobedience, unbelief, etc. Familiar examples include the disobedience of the Israelites in the desert, followed by the 40 years of wandering. One weakness of this book, however, is insufficient detail to how God's grace can help us overcome the ways that we are limiting God in our lives."
2,Buy another book...,"There are many books out there that no poker enthusiast should be without. This is not one of them. Although mildly entertaining in the beginning due to the author's bombastic nature, the book becomes a truly tedious read. The biggest problem is that the book is dated (1984 copyright) and compiles poker strategy into general rules for five card draw and stud (forget about hold em or omaha). The author then expects the reader to extrapolate the given strategies into seven card games. As an added bonus, most of the strategy (if not obvious even to the most oblivious newbies) is either unsound or irrelevant. The only redeeming value of this book is for those who are seeking an encyclopedia of dealer's choice games. Please save your money or buy another book (Peter Steiner's Thursday Night Poker is superb for amatures, Slansky and Brunson are essential for aspiring pros)."
1,problems,This adapter only works part of the time and it doesn't matter what vehicle i'm in. I don't know if there's a short some where in it or what but I get very frustrated trying to wiggle it around and sometimes it works and others it doesn't. Not very convinent!!!
2,I wasn't all that pleased,"I ordered this TV a year or two ago, mostly for power-outages. I used it a bit back in my study; performance was mediocre, which isn't unexpected in this price range. The thing broke after a couple of months and I'm buying a different brand now. The controls on this one were very difficult to use--hard to switch bands, etc. Not the worst little TV out there, probably, but you see that I'm trying a different brand when I need another one."
3,PAPERBACK!!!,"I recently purchased this book for my modern physics course and it is a well written book. However, for some reason the publisher has sent out very poor copies of the book that are paperback and have the same ISBN number. Normally the paperback and hardcover have different ISBN's along with different prices. The copy that I purchased, along with the ones in the school bookstore and various other resellers are paperback and were printed on poor quality printers (the text is fuzzy and has many ink spots throughout the text). Just a warning to any stuents or professors who may be using this book in a course, please make certain that you are getting what you pay for."
2,Very Dry,I purchased this book for an anthropology class and had to read selected chapters. I found this book to be extremely dry and difficult to read. Even my professor was disappointed with it.
2,disappointing textbook,"I chose it for a class I teach in the Sacramento area, and I was highly disappointed with the materials and with the presentation. Very little on modern groups and too much of a gloss of imporant information. I will not be using this text again."
2,not so good,"i expected to hear the soulful voice i'm used to hearing on the radio all the time. But instead i got this sad, dragging sound that sounded like a tired teddy pendergrass. Don't buy this if you're looking for the soulful upbeat teddy we all learned to love."
5,A princess book for my little princess,"My granddaughter Madi loves everything Snow White. Of course she Beauties in Bloom became a favorite because of Snow White. Book is beautiful, but a little short. It is one of Madi's favorites now."
2,Not a good Grip Shifter,I bought this grip shifter dispite the other reviews. When it arrived I put it on my Trek 700. It has Shimano rear and front derailers. The grip shifter for the front worked but was really fussy about shifting 3-2. Then the grip shifter for the rear I didn't even put on. The numbers 1-7 on the grip shifter were in opposite order. If you are going to get these grip shifters I would recommend you get the front and rear derailers for them. I returned these grip shifters and went with Sram MTX comp. Hopefully those will work better.
4,Motorcycle Diaries,This movie did a good job at portraying Ernesto Guevara's road trip through South America. It depicts two bright minds who like many their age want to see some of the world. The film did a good job at showing the situations that helped change Che while not focusing too much on the negative. Redford did a good job.
3,Average road pic,"Supposedly based on Che Guevara's early life, this travelogue-cum-bio pic earned rave reviews, though they were a bit over-wrought. The junky motorcycle keeps breaking down, and the young adventurers engage in various complications as they travel South America long before the young revolutionary decides to change the world. Quite earnest in a naive sort of way."
4,Very Satisfied,The product came very quickly and in good condition all except for the DVD packaging was ripped. I was happy with this company and I would use them again.
4,che guevara,"esta pelicula era muy bueno porque los actores han hecho un bueno trabajo. la pelicula mostrado muchas paises be latina america. tambien, la pelicula mostrado muchos partes de la vida de ernesto guevara. el che guevara el mundo conoce es muy diferente de el che guevara este pelicula. si quieres aprender mas sobre la vida de che guevara, ves este pelicula."
4,The Motorcycle Diaries,"The movie inspired me.Iwas motivated by the film becauseit make you want to help others. The world isn't perfect, and the movie shows how and why? I attented you to watch thisincrediable movie."
3,OK,Makes Che seem like a nice guy but doesn't get into his revolutionary lifestyle later in life. Bought it for online college class research.
3,A Fodor's Travelogue of South America,"This film, based on the first 23 years of revolutionary guerrilla fighter, Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara (1928-67), offers everything a moviegoer desires except substance and insight. Knowing this, the viewer will be treated to spectacular footage of ""the green mansions"" of South America, which include Che's birthplace in Argentina, copper mines in Chile, ravishing stones of Machu Pichu, and a leper colony in Venezuela.The film is a study of different faces and nations of peoples. Scenes of luxurious grandeur of the upper classes contrast with the dignity of the peasants who accept, as natural, their poverty and the pillage of their land by the rich.No attempt is made to gain insight into the main character who will evolve over time into a famous dead warrior remembered by historians and even Castro himself for his senseless brutality."
3,Diarios de motocicleta(motorcycle diaries),The movie was alright but i only heard it . i didn't really see the movie . the projector was really dark so i did't see the movie. from what i heard the movie was good.
4,Da Re-view,"This movie was good. I enjoyed the life lessons learned in this film, though I watched it on a horrible screening. I reccomend that you see this movie sometime. It was a slow movie. It was kind of chinke in the beginning but overall it's a good movie to learn from."
4,Good Film On Its Own,"If you just disregard the political undercurrents that lurk in the film, you'll likely enjoy it. As an adventure, right of passage movie it is interesting and entertaining. Both humorous and dramatic, the acting is top notch. And the cinematography is well done too. The beauty and diversity of South America is nicely portrayed. The film is worth a look."
3,On Second Thought...,"At first I gave this 5 stars for its great performances and awesome scenery, but now I'm starting to agree with some of the other reviewers about the moral implications of painting a man with Che's history as a saint. But lets put the moral aspects aside for a moment. From a dramatic standpoint, it simply is not a believable prequel to the drama that unfolded in his later life. No clue is given here as to why the man became a homicidal maniac. Even Star Wars did a better job of explaining how its protagonist ended up on the dark side."
1,really? Really? REALLY?,"I want my 2 hours back.The plot is okay, the script is bad, and just spend the 2 hours taking a nap, or walking the dog, instead of watching this movie."
5,Awesome fun ride with great parody humor!!!,"This movie deserves much more recognition than it gets. It is well written both in story and in the parody within the story. It's one of Arnold's better movies, along with Predator and T2. The whole concept of a boy with a magic ticket that allows mixing of both real world and fictional cinema world is brilliant. The writers covered all the major bases on this one. It's a movie I can just sit down, relax and watch over and over again. And really, it's the perfect capper to the whole 80's generation of quality, fun action movies. It's a tribute sealed with a kiss and a hell of a good time. Highly recommend it to those who enjoy 80's movies, those who enjoy well-done parodies, and those who just like to have fun and enjoy the little kid inside themselves."
4,"""Big Arnie"" action comedy","The Last Action Hero Feb 18 2013Another ""Big Arnie"" action movie, this one with some comedy! The nearly-2 hours moves quickly, lots of action and special effects! Usual bad guys die 20 times each!"
3,went to see this in the theater and bought the sound track,"this was a ok movie it was was written to be fun cheesy action film the music really caught my attention the AC/DC song big gun stuck in my head it was one of the first two movie sound track cds i bought the other sound track i bought was for the frist "" the Crow ""movie with bruce lee's son"
3,Perhaps the worst of the popular Schwarzenegger Films!,"This is certainly not one of the good Schwarzenegger movies. Arnold plays a parodie of himself in this movie. His ""partner"" is a 12 year old boy, and together they decided to fight crime in their town. Really, that's about it for the plot. And the acting just isen't any better. When I saw this back when it came out in the 90s I was really disappointed. I mean this is the guy who did classics like Terminator I & II, Total Recall & The 6th Day, just to mention a few of his glorious movies. This is comparatively a real let down, don't believe the hype of most of the other reviews. If your expecting something even remotely close to the just mentioned movies, then forget it, you won't find it in this movie."
2,Needs more Austin Power,"Child actor Austin O'Brien steals scenes in THE LAST ACTION HERO, although his stand-out performance is not enough to make the film worthwhile. Not that the filmmakers weren't trying to make a quality picture. For effort, THE LAST ACTION PICTURE tops a number of routine action flicks (COMMANDO, ERASER) Arnold has made. But by time the closing credits roll, THE LAST ACTION HERO's slow moments outnumber its memorable ones. Inspirational line: ""It's what you make it."""
5,Terrific!,Works great! We have two small dogs and it is wonderful being able to walk them with only 1 leash instead of two that get tangled. Easy to adjust - our dogs are two different heights and the ability to move each one separatey was a godsend.
4,Family Drama,"I enjoyed this book. Growing up in the the same town as the author did , I can see he captured the flavor of the area, the people and the time. Some pages were difficult to read (emotionally) and you have to admire the author for his strength in overcoming some very hard times."
4,Good update of Diet for a Small Planet,"Years ago I read Diet for a Small Planet, while become a vegetarian. I became a vegetarian and then returned a few years later to being an omnivore. Since then I am returning to this healthy way of life. My yoga instructor reccomended this book. I found it had helpful updates but really nothing that new. If you are just starting on the road to vegetarianism and want to know how much of each type of essential fatty acid you need, where you get your nutrients from, and how to handle those who are arguing against your diet choice this is a good book for you. I sort of felt that I had been there, done that.Good updated information, but not that useful to me."
3,some good info but disappointing recipes,"There is a lot of good nutrional information. The author spent a little too much time going into exactly how changing your diet to vegetarianism is going save you from disease. I was very disappointed in the recipes, especially the sandwich recipes. With the exception of one, all of the other 9 choices were a soy-meat substitute. I've been a vegetarian for two months and I'm more creative with veggie pitas, wraps and sandwiches than the author is with her soy-meat substitute lunches."
5,EVERYTHING You Need to Know,"This book has so much information about converting to a plant based diet. It had all the info about the nutrition of vegetarians including what vegetarian diets tend to lack. It dispels all the nutritional rumors and has a handy guide on how to switch and how to deal with those who may chastize you. It even has recepies and cooking tips for the new vegetarian chef.Whether you do it for your health, for your love of animals, or because you want something new, Becoming Vegetarian is definitly what I would recommend for those new to the switch."
1,NOTE renders PAL only in black and white,Note to non-US consumers - the current driver/pilot (3.06) issued by Belkin supports only black and white rendering. Do not bother purchasing if for PAL.
2,Disappointing and Outdated,"I was looking for something covering video post production topics completely. Although the name gives such an impression this book is not a good choice: First of all It is a little bit old fashioned and outdated. The subjects are not covered in depth and there are some parts that are really hard to understand. This is not a ""guide"", this is not a real ""textbook"" so it is inbetween."
3,"awesome for what it does, but disappointing for what it doesn't","i agree with the other reviewers - the sound is awesome. not ""all"" the presets are awesome, but there are plenty out there to start as templates to craft most any sound you can think of.however...to borrow a famous informercial's catch-phrase, if you want to ""set it and forget it"" then you're good to go. if you want to change your presets, be prepared to stop playing because this can't be done remotely (i.e. via midi). at least you can switch on/off all the various effects remotely.also, you'll find this item more worthwhile if you're a guitar player. once again, bass players get lesser consideration from line 6.it sounds great, relatively painless to use (at least in the limited ways it can be used), and i was able to get it for a great price. i'm enjoying it, but i wouldn't buy it again. rock on!"
5,how can you not love PLOW?,"Ever since i heard PLOW's first release i was hooked. since they were in highschool, they have been writing some of the finest music out there. this album has almost everything from they're early days so if have just heard of them, this record is a must."
2,Everyone is right - this battery stinks,"To me ""rechargable"" means ""indefinite use,"" not ""conks out after 18 months."" We bought the camera and an extra battery ... For a long time everything worked well - we went on a vacation ... and took loads of pictures with only one recharge during the whole week. But sometime around Jan. 2002, the charges started being shorter and shorter. Eventually around May it got to the point where we could take 3 photos or one movie and then the battery died. I have just recently emailed Sony and they replied that ""since our batteries have no Memory Effect [loss of function due to recharging], your battery is faulty and needs replacement."" ..."
2,"Thank you to ""A customer from Canada""","I too have been disappointed with this battery. My first one lasted for about 10 months, then I purchased a second one which also stopped holding a charge after about 10 months.I followed the advice of a previous reviewer (a customer from Canada) and now both batteries work again. They just needed to be completely discharged prior to attempting to charge them which wasn't happening through their normal use."
1,Expensive and short lived,"I have two of the batteries and they both exhibit the same problem: a full charge lasts about 10 shots going from ""80 minutes"" suddenly down to nothing and then shutting off.I've tried the tricks about draining the battery by keeping it on until it automatically shuts off and then doing a full recharge. Tried it twice consecutively, but to no avail."
1,SONY Disappointing!,"We own the Sony Digital Camera DSC-P1. Within a year we had problems with it and it hasn't been two years yet and we have been facing the same problems with the battery that the other reviewers complained about -- it says its fully charged, but when I'm about to take a photo it reads that the battery is ""empty"". I am disappointed in SONY!! Although the camera was within the 1 year warranty, I still had to pay for Labor (!!) Now it seems like I have to [buy]...a new battery."
5,Impressionist Perfection on every page!,"This book was splendid! It was georgeously created, and it the care the author and editor put into the making of this book shows on every page. The thing that makes this book unique is that every painting is shown IN COLOR--not black and white sections taking up half the book, etc. The paintings are also put on the page in a way that makes you focus on the genius of each and every one. It makes you realize that Renoir truly was a genius in his time. He was an original and stylish painter, and this book is a great tribute to him and his art---as well as a book that anyone, with art history knowledge or not, would enjoying having on both his/her coffee table and as a book to read and treasure!"
1,"Biased, leftist drivel","This book is the most biased text book I have ever been assigned. The book contains a collection of essays that basically assert that white educators are evil and ill-equipped to educate anyone of an different ethnicity. Unfortunately, if you're reading this, chances are you're not considering the book for a pleasure read."
3,"A good album, but the debut was better","Sevendust's ""Home"" is tyical of most second albums- the music is good, but nowhere near their debut..songs like ""Denial"" and the title track are powerful, but don't match up to ""Black"", ""Bitch"", or ""Too Close To Hate"". Guest singer Skin of Skunk Anansie does an excellent job on ""Licking Cream"", but Chino of the Deftones doesn't live up to expectations on ""Bender"". Buy this album if you like metal/"
5,sounds awesome,i heard this from my cousin and it sounds pretty good.this cd is all right. get this for you or your friends. home sweet home.
4,Great band,Imagine a Nu-metal band that has some funk and soul mixed in with metal and you have Sevendust. This is one of my favorite hard rock bands. The music is enough to have this band standout but their vocalist truly sets them apart from most bands in the nu-metal genre since he can actually belt out some damn good notes much like (but doesn't sound like) Maynard from Tool and Mudvayne's front man. Standouts in a sea of ordinary.
4,Eat Their Dust,"Despite dreadlocked singer Lajon Witherspoon and tuning down to the nether regions, Atlanta's Sevendust are anything but a rap-metal band. Brutal cuts like the title track and ""Denial"" are like Slayer slowed down to normal speed. The spacy ""Waffle"" finds Witherspoon crooning ""I need to find a meaning, I'm useless,"" exploring alienation in today's culture. Deftones' singer Chino Moreno duels with Witherspoon on ""Bender"" which threatens to dissolve just before its ending. This band can throw down, as guitarists John Connolly and Clint Lowery, plus drummer Morgan Rose prove in punching bag fashion on track after track. My only beef with this album is it's not long enough and I want more."
3,Sevendust is back with a decent album,"Sevendust is one of my favorite bands. they have an unbelievable vocalist, who which I believe has yet to release a super smash hit. The album is good but it could be better, songs like home and licking cream fail to deliver and it is very bland throughout the cd However songs like Denial, Grasp and Crumbled keep you very hypnotized with there great music and lyrics, I reckemond this cd to anyone who loves great hard rock music"
3,Not as good as debut,"Though ""Home"", Sevendust's sophmore release has its share of killer tunes it comes no where neer duplicating the sheer energy of their self titled debut. Sometimes great, some times boring the higlightes include ""Waffle"", ""Licking Cream"", ""Denial"" and the title track."
3,Above average...barely,"I'm sorry, but I've been a fan of this band since their self-titled album and I'm very disappointed in their CD ""Home"". The band seems to be going for a ""let's see how low our guitars can go"" aproach. Lajon doesn't scream nearly as much as he did on the first album. Listen to their debut then listen to Home, the new album just isn't nearly as heavy (vocals,guitars, everything). Lately I've been seeing alot of them on MTV, I'm wondering...perhaps they toned down just a bit to be apart of the Korn/Limp Bizkit MTV crowd? All this aside, Home is still worth picking up. Just don't expect the same Sevendust sound you heard in the debut. Be sure to check out ""Denial"" and ""Reconnect""."
3,Welcome back home Sevendust,"Atlanta's Sevendust play the currently popular brand of rock that seethes with heavy-metal unhappiness and jolts with hip-hop disequilibrium. Home, their breakout album, steers an intelligently reliable middle course in the genre while operating within a faintly arty framework of hardness: Like Tool, Sevendust are lucid but intense. Their songs deplore communication breakdowns and look for salvation. On the skate hymn ""Waffle,"" singer Lajon Witherspoon's strong voice gathers clarity and even soul. He's equally effective on ""Licking Cream,"" a sensational tango with Skunk Anansie's lead singer, Skin. Witherspoon spits in the eye of his own attraction, maintaining, ""I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes"" as she reels off a mad string of wild arias; in Sevendust's genre, life is never just a cool romance"
3,Could've been better!,"I am a ""born again"" metalist thanks to Sevendust! When I heard their self-titled debut album I was instantly hooked!! They helped to bring from the depths of musical woes and frustrations back to a level interest. I was eagerly anticipating ""Home"" but was slightly disappointed. The album is good however, but it truly lacks the raw energy of the first album in comparison. If you are curious to how Sevendust truly sounds, buy their first album, but be sure to buy this one eventually it would still be worth your while!"
4,A Laugh Riot!,"Sally Field leads an all star cast in the laugh riot ""Soapdish."" Ms. Field has never been funnier or more appealing, and Kevin Kline matches her every step of the way, as do co-stars Whoopi Goldberg and Robert Downey, Jr. all the way down to Carrie Fisher in a small role. This is one nutty, crazy and funny movie. Everything about it works, which makes it an almost perfect comedy. If you really, really like Sally Field (and who with taste doesn't?) then you'll love this movie."
1,Don't order for adult group therapy,This would be more appropriate for adolescents. I do not recommend for adults. The activities are simple and somewhat redundant.
1,"Cloudy, poorly packed","I received the bottle of Hoxsey Red Clover in an oversize package. It was wrapped in bubble wrap, not in a a box, I don't remember if there was a security seal.It was cloudy and tasted wrong. I used it twice and returned it. I have not received notification that my money has been refunded, nor have I noticed the refund on my Credit Card Statement.Would never use this shipper again."
3,For the Spiderman fan,"I gave this to my 13 year old nephew who enjoys Spiderman, Batman, etc. as a extra birthday gift. He was excited when he opened thinking it might be similar to ""Scene It"". He didn't have a DVD player to try it out right then, so few weeks later I asked him what he though of it.Although he said it was fun, he did have the same response as another reviewer by saying it became repetitive after several plays. I decided to ask him what he thought would be a good price for this game because I wanted to know what value he had given it. He told me that he wouldn't pay more than $5 or $6 for it, which is actually more than I picked it up for so I decided it was a good enough deal.If you can pick this up for $5 or less I'd say it's a worthy add-on gift or something to have around the house to play with visitors."
3,"Not bad, but sounds could be more realistic","My 21-month old son was fascinated by this book ... for about half an hour!The sound buttons are easy to press, and don't seen too flimsy, but the sounds themselves aren't very realistic."
5,Necessary & essential for all trial attorneys,"Richardson on Evidence is absolutely the finest resource for any New York State Attorney to have on hand when dealing with issues of evidence, whether in preparation for trial or as a quick reference guide for evidentiary issues that may come up during trial."
1,Poor Quality and Support,"I would not recommend purchasing this or any other Sony product. It is apparent they do not test their products prior to shipment.I purchased this device and it did not work from the start. After several hours on hold and on the phone with their technicians, it still did not work so they recommended I return it - on my nickel as their warranty states. Well, the second one did not work either and the technicians could not figure it out so they want me to pay to ship this one back too, again on my nickel. I refuse because I don't know where it will end - I have no confidence the next one will work either. I was taught to not throw good money after bad so I now have a doorstop. Sony has lost a customer over this and that seems to be ok with them - that's a warning."
2,dose not deliver as promiss,"Will not read all formats as it siad it would. Tried to burn onto Ativa DVD+R DL, ten seconds into the burn it quits even after three to four new disks."
3,installation dvd not compatible with drive out of the box,"The installation cd wouldn't run on the drive right out of the box. Thus, the codecs for dvd playback could not be installed and had to be downloaded from the internet to get it working properly."
5,Amazing,"What a great book. My first real look at their work and I’m already buying another a day after finishing it. Great insights from both artists, inspirational, worth every penny. Amazing collection of work. I’ll be using this book as a great resource for a long time to come."
4,Great Collection From Two Great Artists,"This is a great collection, especially for people who do not have many of the two artists previously published art books. If you do, (as I do) it is still a nice collection with a few extras thrown in. It is a good book for anyone who likes either of these two artists."
2,Disappointed,"The picture shows a Black & Decker Toaster-R-Oven, so we thought we were buying the oven. Turns out, we bought the mounting hood only. Picture could have stated ""Toaster-R-Oven pictured, but not included"" for us dummies. Item did arrive in a timely manner."
2,mzr700dpc,"...I purchased the minidisc recorder to listed to music while on long runs along the canal banks in the Phoenix area. The g-protection is worthless. It skips more than my [other]full size sony disc player. As for working out in the gym or traveling, it's great. I don't recommend it for running. Because I bought this item for running, and its performance is poor for this activity, I am putting it up for sale."
4,History of Heavy,"In 1968, Blue Cheer was the heaviest band on earth. In 1970, Black Sabbath dethroned them. In 1985, Pentagram dethroned Sabbath, but in 1986, Pentagram abdicated the throne of the heaviest band on earth and Candlemass acended the throne. Their reign lasted until 1992 when Crowbar invaded the heavy metal scene. To this day no one has been able to conquer or subdue these sludgey, doomed juggernauts. they are ultimately slow and HEAVY, brain-crushingly so. If you do not like slow and heavy, Crowbar will crush you. If you are strong enough to aproach the throne through such gravity, then you will be rewarded with killer heavy metal!"
5,Next of Kin,I have been looking for this movie for sometime now.I just happened to remember Amazon had it.I love shopping with Amazon.I do not shop anywhere else online.
2,Next Of Kin,"With almost all the products over the years I've ordered; the condition of my purchases were great. For being a new copy I purchased, I was not happy to see scratches on the video side of the disc. Because I did not spend that much on it I dropped it off at a Video store that can repair it because I really like Patrick Swayze movies and wanted this for my collection...I also did not want to go through the hassel of sending it back. Thank you for the chance to review the services.Theresa Salo"
4,Next of Kin,"Great movie, just what you would expect to happen if you were from that part of the USA. I would hope my relative would at least do something to avenge my death."
1,A Snore,"This book totally failed to capture my interest. I found myself unable to care WHAT happened to the protagonist. I gave up a quarter of the way through (very rare for me). Oh, well. A lot of very good writers have written the occasional bomb (like Robert Ludlum, Patricia Cornwell, and Sue Grafton, for instance). I'll probably check out DuBois' next book. Hopefully this one is a fluke."
4,Humor and Ghosts with enormous tongues,"This is a fun Hong Kong movie. It tells how a bumbling, good-hearted man is able to find love, adventure, horror and a beast with a tongue that cuts down trees! This is the first in a great trilogy that I would urge anyone who is interested in the Hong-Kong movie scent to check out this funny, romantic, action packed title!"
1,"Beware of early ""rough cut/work print"" dvd release.",This is a great movie but beware of one of the early non-anamorphic dvd releases. I'm not certain but I think it's the one with the red cover. The print used for this release is made from an inferior rough cut with incomplete soundtrack and different music. It's obviously a work print (complete with visible splices) of inferior quality used before the editing and soundtrack were refined.
2,Not Pleased,"Delivered in a timely manner, remote did not work. Was initially told to mail remote back and then I would receive replacement. Then was notified by phone that I did not need to mail back, would automatically get replacement. That was 3 weeks ago and still have not received anything, or notification of resolution. Unable to work DVD/VCR well without remote.Not real happy about service."
2,After two years of little use it stopped working completely,"The device is hard to use.The interface is very poor.After two years of little use, it stopped working completely."
2,The perpetual Hollywood flaw,"Movies do a great job of showing what is wrong in people's lives. Max's friends are boring, trite, self-absorbed, phony and tiring. All true. Who would want to live in that horrible world of pretense and deceit? (And yes, I am exaggerating quite a bit....)But what does he have in the hypnotizing world with Nora? We never see them talk. They have no relationship outside sex. And we already see that tapering off. They do nothing. Say nothing. Go nowhere. Have no interests. Life is about more than copulation and fellatio, no matter how skillfully performed. There are many hours spent that are not in bed. What did these people do during that time? He loves her? Yeah sure.....why?Lots of well-worn clichés to fill in the time. Lots of slow-mo sex footage to make the essentially empty film last longer. I bet the novel was interesting. The film was not."
4,Wonderful Teaming of Actors,"I just saw the edited version of ""White Palace"" and I remember how much I enjoyed the uncut version, with its gritty realism. Please note the description above says ""starring Luis Mandoki,"" when he's the director! The star is the vastly underutilized James Spader who I just saw in a strange movie called ""Secretary."" Here he's in love with the older Susan Sarandon and it's magic. I also read the book, whick is quite different from the movie, but they're both quite enjoyable. Pop the popcorn and enjoy!"
3,"Decent, But Not Great",This movie is clearly a product of it's time and has a nostalgic vibe to it. It's a lot of fun to see several TV Stars of the 80's and 90's together in this movie and the plot while severly silly is done in a way that makes it fun to watch and doesn't take itself too seriously. Menu For Murder is a tv movie from the late 80's and it's clear that it wasn't meant to be serious but rather to be somewhat comedic and appeal to a particular demographic; the same demographic that likes LIFETIME movies and soap operas. It's rather cheesy but definetly worth watching for a bit of frothy fun.
5,Excellent Book - One you will read again and again,"If you have friends who like to read non-fiction then they will love this. These questions tackle issues that we all deal with but have probably never taken the time to answer adequately for ourselves. The answers are not just opinions, but are well-reasoned, well-documented, practical ideas that can be used in our everyday lives. Mr. Denney's research and insight has saved us all many hours of searching for answers that we never seem to have time to find. I highly recommend this book. It is an interesting read and you will love the stories."
2,Be frugal don't buy~!,Just look online for ideas and use common sense. This book offers no new information what so ever so pass.
3,It'll work,I was expecting something a little more heavy duty. Mind you I've had no problems. The mat fit great and is doing what it's supposed to do. The material is just a little on the thin side. It just seemed like the price I paid was a little high for what I actually got. It still looks great and cleans easily.
2,Photo of item on your website is misleading,Our son wanted an Under Armour Hooded Sweatshirt for Christmas with a draw string. We found one on your site and ordered it. When we got it we found that it did not have a draw string as advertised. We contacted you and sent a photo of the item to show how it was advertised on your site and we were told they did not carry this item with a draw string. That being the case it should not have been listed on your site showing that it had a draw string.
5,Very pleased,We were very pleased with our purchase. I have no complaints at all. Great price and the exact item and size we were searching for. I highly recommend.
5,Country Gold - Two legends in one great album,"Until I listened to this album, I had forgotten how wonderful Tammy and George were together. Their voices blend and harmonize effortlessly, and it's obvious why they were the King and Queen of country music in the 1970s. I think the love/hate relationship they had over the years added to the ""realness"" of their songs.If you want a great album featuring two of country's original superstars, buy this one. You'll find yourself singing along and remembering a time before microwaves, cell phones and home computers."
2,Did not like,I guess I did not pay attention to the songs listed before ordering. I would not order this CD unless your familiar with the songs
4,Great lil gift,"It was a bit smaller than I expected, but I'm sure there were measurements, consumer error. The sheep is so cute and the burp cloths are well made and so soft. Great baby shower gift, my sister loved it!"
3,TINY...BUT CUTE,"This is an adorable, high quality looking gift. However, don't let the picture deceive you. THIS THING IS TINY. In the picture, the lamb is larger than the cloths, but in reality, the lamb is only about four-five inches long and smaller than the folded cloths. Actually, I don't even think the lamb in the picture is anything like the one you get. It looks completely different to me. This one appears softer and larger and the one I got is very compact.This gift could never stand alone, but will make a cute addition to a larger gift. Not what I expected."
5,Sweet Little Gift,I didn't realize how small this would be but it's not a problem. I should have looked at the dimensions. I would still have bought it had I known it was small. It is super cute and the lamb is very soft. Perfect little shower gift but too small to stand alone. I have gotten a couple more things to go with it.
2,Really small,"Whoever buys this, realize that it's about the size of a coffee cup. Literally, you could probably fit the gift into a large coffee cup. Definitely not enough to give as a stand-alone gift."
3,Well marked,"This book was used so it was expected for it to have some wear and tear. The book was in fine condition (binding intact, no earmarked pages, etc) but there was an excessive amount of writing on the pages."
4,Classic Bellairs/Strickland,"This book is a classic Bellairs/Strickland! Probably one of the best that Strickland's done so far! The story unfolds fast, and the characters develop at the same pace. A new character was introduced in this title, which might have been a little ambitious on the part of Brad Strickland since it was the first true Bellairs book that he wrote. I think that if he had waited a few more years, once people started to get used to the idea of him writing the books, then he could introduce the new character. It's great that Strickland has continued the Bellairs series like this, and I can't wait for the next title in the series!"
1,Ya gotta be kidding me....!!!,"This product was NOT EVEN as advertised! Bluetooth was chipped and even after three hours was non functioning and never powered up. In the future, I will NEVER buy bulk, especially from THESE guys!! I'm disgusted that they would even have the audacity to sell such garbage, but I guess you live and learn. Thank goodness I bought another Bluetooth unit from a more reputable seller!! Buyer Beware!!!"
3,Motorola HS 820 Bluetooth,"The unit works well and is very light weight. The only drawback is the charger. Most bluetooth use either mini or micro usb, this has its own unique charger so none of my other chargers will work with it."
3,HS820,"I bought the HS820 when I really wanted the HS850. My mistake , so many numbers, so little time. The HS820 works but lacks the features of the HS850.The 850 turns off when you close the mic arm. The mic audio is louder on the 850 also. They both work fine but the edge goes to the 850."
2,Not for me,"This ear bud was extreemly light and maybe that is the problem. It was so small that it didn't fit my ear well enough to hear. The mic portion did not send good sound to the other party. Probably a fine piece of equipment, but not for me."
1,Waste of Money,"This product didn't work at all. I could never get any sound from it. Now I have a Motorola H850, and it works great! It's worth the extra money."
3,Not Bad,"Problems I've got with this unit:1. Too short range; much shorter than stated 10m;2. Lost signal or lost connection with cellphone more frequently than I imagined;3. When I used this headset to call my friends and T-mobile customer reps, they usually complained that they can barely heard my voice. Maybe the voice collected by the headset is too weak!"
1,I have tried all the motorola bluetooth devices,"and all of them have proven static prone with my Samsung. I have the new Samsung razor phone, so this maybe a problem with the frequency with the phone and motorola device or possibly just an anomaly with my phone. Nevertheless, beware. The static happened in all environs and distances."
4,motorola headsert wireless,like product but sometimes it doesn't pick up when you have a incoming call
1,I'm glad I didn't pay for it...,"I bought this along with a T-Mobile RAZR and Amazon thoughtfully provided a code for use at check-out the made this headset free. I'm glad I didn't pay for it. The fit is ok, the range seems to be fairly good, and it's nice and light, but the volume is the kicker: I just can't hear with it in my car (a MINI, which is admittedly fairly loud inside), and people I talk to can't hear me very well, either. Actually, I can't hear much better with it at my desk, either. Get it if it's free and you want a backup, but I would be returning this if I had paid for it."
2,Not worth the money,"The audio is very soft of this headset. I have to use one hand to push it against my ear each time I want to use it. Also, it is always checking to make sure it is still connected to the phone, so it beeps every 5 to 10 seconds."
1,Poorly made,The sound is awful and people can't understand what your saying. It was hard to get it to setup on my bluetooth and every time i put it on charge it lost connection with my phone.When trying to turn it off its like the off button would not fuction. I gave it away and went back to the 720 which I have used before and it works great I would not recommend the 820 to no one.
3,comfortable but horrible battery life.,While I've been pleased with the comfort and sound quality I'm lucky to get 2 hours of standby time before the headset starts making the warning beep that the battery is running low. The battery may last quite a while after the beep starts but it's too distracting to leave it on.
1,Dead within a week + terrible customer service,"My headset died within a week. It took 30 min with Motorola, mostly on hold and navigating voice menu hell, to get a return authorization number. You can not return it with this RAN and you have to pay shipping to send it back. I don't plan to buy another Motorola product again."
1,could be better,"bought this headset for use with my motorola razr v3 phone. i figured sticking with motorola proprietary equipment would be a good idea. i'm a bit diappointed, though. the performance is mediocre. on occasion it refuses to take a call, it just goes silent, which makes for a mad scramble to turn the thing off to take the call on the handset. no fun. the audio is also not outstanding. i can hear, but even with the volume at the top setting, i am left asking people to repeat themselves occasionally. it also tends to blot out any chance of clear voice transmission in the wind, which is, i suppose, to be expected. my final critique is that the ear loop isnt quite secure. it mounts only on the right ear and doesnt remain steady. if i'm sitting in my car, using it, it isnt a problem, but with much movement at all it flops out from my ear.perhaps my expectations for such a headset are too high, but this one didnt quite make the mark."
4,HS820: Good middle-of-the-road Product,"This is my first blue tooth head set and I'm using it w/ my new MotoRazr. I read a few reviews of several headset prior to making this purchase and thought this one sounded decent. It has been. The only problem I have had is with static if I walk 40+ feet away from my phone, which amounts to having to have the phone upstairs if I'm upstairs or downstairs if I'm downstairs. I thought I'd read that this had a larger range than one of the other headsets, but apparently it is approximately equivalent. Other than that I have been very happy with this headset and would still recommend it based on its quality per cost."
2,Bluetooth,What I dislike on the Bluetooth I bought is that you cannot use it on both Ears. Also it doesn't fit into the Ear.It also vibrate when you turn it up.Thank you!
4,excellent product - volume problem there but rare,"An excellent product overall. So light that I sometimes forget it is even on my ear. While the volume is fine overall, sometimes I do wish it fit more snugly or that the volume was a bit stronger. This is rare, however, and usually only an issue when I am driving with the windows open...but it also can come into play with especially faint connections. Overall, however, I highly recommend this product...esp. for the price!"
3,Power Cord Warning,"Be aware that most Motorola phones, including the RAZR, have switched to the mini-usb connector for charging. This headset uses the older, proprietary P2K connector for charging. If your phone uses the mini-usb (like the RAZR) and you buy this headset, you will need to have two different chargers"
4,Does what it says it will.,"I Purchased this at sale price. Product performed as advertised. With the lower cost, and the performance meeting expectations, this product had great value."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"It is difficult to hear callers on this bluetooth headset, even with the volume at max. Don't buy!"
2,Not what I thought,"This thing is just not what I thought it would be, I use it with my LG8100 cell, It looks good but that's all I can say good about it. EVERYBODY tells me that I sound like I'm in a bottle, or there is a repeat echo the receiver hears when they speak or they hear static, I have returned it to verizon twice, First time they said it was a bad set, the second time they took in the back and said they fixed it.....well it still s___ks.Any suggestions?? What a waste of moneyAGM"
3,Works but has quirks,I've used the HS820 for 6 months with a Treo 650. Some observations:CONSa) the on/off technique of holding in the control button and watching for the light to flash causes me to constantly leave the headset on. I'm never sure whether I'm turning it on or off.b) volume is weak. It can't be adjusted loud enough.c) requires yet another charger to go with the headset.d) fit is OK but flops around a lot.PROs:a) Voice quality sending and receiving is good.b) Simple to register with the phone.c) No quality issues just design gripes!It doesn't support voice dialing with the TREO 650 but neigher does any other Bluetoooth device. This is a major major problem with the TREO not the headsets. TREO should be ashamed of this inadequacy.
1,Charger connection is terrible,"I had this unit for less than a month and one of the gold charger connectors already came out and I was told that it is damaged and not covered under warranty so it's useless. My Motorola E815 phone used the same charger, but the connectors are surrounded by plastic so they can't move, where the headset's connectors are set alone and easy to break."
1,bad product,"I purchased this product and had to return it because it was defective. The second product kept cutting off in the middle of my conversation, wouldn't hold a charge, the person I was having a conversation with could barely hear me, and overall it was just a bad product. I wouldn't recommend for anyone to buy this."
4,Motorola Bluetooth Headset,"This is a good product, my only complaint is that it could be louder. I tried turning the volume up all the way but when your on the road and there is alot of road noise, it can be hard to hear."
5,Good Value for the money paid,"I was a bit nervous buying this item after reading some of the reviews, but actually it is not bad at all! Charges quickly and it works great with my RAZR One touch does everything-- would recommend to everyone!"
3,HS820 Review,I LOVE the hands-free convenience of the HS820. I didn't like that the earpiece itself was a little bulky and not very attractive to look at on the ear. This particular model was not very good at noise cancellation and that's very important when communicating with people on the phone.
3,Good but not for long,"I was initially impressed with the 820. Decent sound, fairly comfortable, got the job done. I use headset 6 days a week all day. Here lately it frequently goes in to some digital buzz where I have to get the caller ot call back. IF I turn the headset up to hear in less than perfect conditions, the caller complains of feedback. Decent battery life."
2,can you hear me,"when i first got this device , i thought it was the greatest invention , its great when you are driving.the big problem is when you call someone , they can not hear youso they hang up on you, also you have to speak loudly ."
3,well...,"The charger cord is left to be desired.It does not connect well at all to bluetooth, falls off connection all the time. I have purchased 2 ( one as a gift ) both chargers are the same..."
2,Battery does not hold charge,"While I like the size and shape of this bluetooth, I find that there's a problem with it holding a charge. I charge it overnight, then go to turn it on the following afternoon, and there's no power."
5,Motorola HS820 Bluetooth Headset - Hematite Gray,This product is great! I love having it while I'm working around the house or in the car! The speaker & microphone in this product are much more effective than the Jabra headset that I've had for several years!
3,Good designs but a disappointment,"This book would be a great addition to my collection if I didn't have a collection. The designs themselves are great but these designs have been used in other books or are so similaar to other patterns in several other books that I regret buying. The carts are in black and white. They are small designs and easy to finish in a couple of hours. Quite a few of these small designs change colors over 10 times. If you have few cross stitch books, this one would be a great addition to your beginning collection. But if you have a large collection, examine this before buying."
5,CD For Kids and Adults,This is an inspiring CD of world music. It comes with a brochure of information about the selections that I have used as a teacher of Social Studies.
4,World Party,Our family really enjoys all the tracks on this CD. Its a great blend of upbeat music that all ages enjoy. My 16 month old son's face lights up when I turn it on and we dance around our kitchen. I highly recommend it for times when everyone is feeling a little cranky or cooped up by this cold weather. Some songs are in languages other than English but the words to all songs are included. Another bonus for kids who like to learn lyrics to songs. This is by far one of the most loved of all our children's music.
4,Get up and dance!,"I have high expectations for Putumayo albums, so when I first listened to this one, I was a bit disappointed; I am so tired of hearing ""Three Little Birds"", and although I loved singing ""Waltzing Matilda"" as a kid, this version drags a bit. However, once I got used to skipping these two songs, I fell in love with the rest of the album. Now, my daughter and I immediately start bouncing in happiness at the first notes of ""Fatuyo""; you just can't help dancing to the infectious songs!"
2,Not Reccomended,"This album is what I call - mock kids music. Too often we try to make kids into little adults. This album is NOT full of kids music, but full of music some adults thought kids SHOULD like to hear (policically correct, multicultural, etc.). I have seen this in a number of the classical selections for kids as well. Someone says, Oh that sounds like a kid should like it. But it fails terrrible, as does this album."
5,Looks very nice with our wooden staircase,"We now have 3 of these in our house. I LOVE the look of them. They don't stand out like a typical baby gate. They are very user friendly and easy to open & close. I am now not always worried about my daughter pulling the gate down on top of herself. Only negative is the very confusing & non-user friendly directions. My husband also had to make a few minor modifications to make it fit. However, all in all we are very happy with the product."
1,dont buy it,"I purchased the gate for my 21 daughter who had 2 strokes during a rt frontal lobe resection. We have two large dogs at home and I wanted to be able to keep them in a room while my daughter was having PT and then practicing on her own to walk. We were very concerned with them ""loving"" her too much and too close and knocking her down. The gate was a royal pain to install - actually messed up the 1st try. It was beautiful and matched the decor and kept the dogs out. Imagine our surprise when our Boxer mix figured out how to open it. Then 6 months down the road one of the PLASTIC pieces broke so now when you close it and then open it, it comes off the hinges. Why would they make a beautiful wooden gate and give it plastic hinges? I am now on a quest to locate a new gate to replace the $110 6 month old gate. Would not recommend anyone to buy this gate"
1,Packaged too soon after staining,"This product is beautiful, but after 2 attempts to receive one without styrofoam attached to it - I gave up. You can tell as you take it out of the box that it was put packaged too soon after they stained it; therefore having styrofoam permanently on the rails. I even contacted Evenflo about this problem, but they didn't have a response. The gate is gorgeous though and I was sad to have to give up on it."
2,Hated this gate,"This gate is nice in theory. I ordered it because it got so many good reviews. When I received it, I couldn't believe how heavy it is. It's very complicated to adjust and install. I also think this looks dated. Unless your home is early American or more country style decor, you probably won't like it. It's over kill for a safety gate and far too heavy to use at the top of the stairs."
4,Sony battery,This battery is identical to the one Sony supplied with the camcorder and I expect similar longevity from it.So far I have not been disappointed.
1,Sony NPFM50 InfoLithium Battery for Various Sony,"I am not sure if the battery is what caused the problem, but since I have put the battery in, my camera will not work at all. I charged the battery and now when I turn the camera on, all I see is a screen with the menu on it. It will take a picture, but it is just black, so I am not sure if it shorted something out or not."
1,Sony NPFM50 Infolithium Battery knockoff?,"Just reciently returned my Sony NPFM50 battery that was sold as an oem product but was, in fact, a knock off of the oem battery. My camera would not recognize it as an infolithium battery and after powering up would then give me the message - infolithium only - and then proceed to shut down. I bought this as a spare and my battery that came with the camera worked fine. The seller understood and promptly refunded my money including the cost to return the new battery. My point: beware of fakes they are out there."
5,A classic and a bonus!,"Lori Foster started the wave of hot contemporary category romances with her book, IMPETUOUS. Here's a great chance to revisit this groundbreaking story, newly packaged. Also, you get a free bonus read from up-and-coming author, Julie Elizabeth Leto. ONE WICKED WEEKEND is ultra-hot!"
3,"Not plausible, quite predictable","This is a quick read. In fact you can skip a good chunk of it, it's so predictable. For the price, this is acceptable, but this writer has done better."
2,Disappointing at best.,There is nothing more annoying than a heroine who is constantly whining about her insecurities. Whine whine whine. Jeez. I kept reading in hopes she would get over herself but no dice. i have read plenty of Lori Foster books that were good but this sure wasnt one of them.
3,Not her best stuff - and it's a re-issue,"Having read and thorougly enjoyed many of Lori Foster's books (and stories in anthologies), I have high expectations when I pick up a new book by her. This was not a first-time publication. I think that Lori has really found her stride now, but had not when she wrote this one. I felt there were gaps in plot line and character development, plus it didn't sizzle from the get-go like most of her other work...P>But Lori Foster is still one of my favorite authors and I will definitely continue to read any of her work that I can get my hands on!P.S. This was a double issue with what was basically a short story by Julie Elizabeth Leto that was also disappointing compared to other books/stories of hers that I have read."
2,Disappointing,"I love Lori Foster, but I found this book disappointing. I found the heroine boring and shallow. It just didn't have the same ""spark"" as most of her work. I'd recommend any of her other books over this one."
2,Not her best work,"Foster has become a must read for me through her later works, and I would recommend that anyone who is not already a fan to start with another of her stories. The main characters, Carlie and Tyler, didn't seem to be fully developed. I found it very difficult to sympathize or understand Carlie, and found it even more difficult to like her. I half hoped Tyler would find someone less abrasive and leave her in the end. I found the short story at the end of the book much more enjoyable. I am somewhat surprised by the positive reviews that Impetuous has received. If you are a die-hard Foster fan, read it for yourself and see what you think. If not, unless you like prickly hard to like heroines and easily duped heroes, don't bother"
4,Wonderful!,"I can't believe that was her first book! It was wonderful! Foster's writing has flair and a sense of style that I thoroughly enjoy, so I'm going to be mixing it up - alternating her older books with her most recent. It's gonna be a fun trip! :-)"
5,Best Season of All,"One of the best seasons of ANY Star Trek series. Outstanding performances of the entire cast, great storyline and production quality that surpass the last 4 Star Trek Movies. Do you want to understand why Enterprise is one of the best Star Trek series, after TOS and TNG? Buy this Season!"
2,Yawn,This episode proved that it is much better to shoot at aliens with cool looking lasers than pretend that people watch Start Trek for intellectual or pyschological stimulation.
2,Zombie Vulcans? Common....,"Was this released on Halloween or something? This was just sad. It's bad enough that the entire series seems to be written around T'Pol's boobs, but now Zombies? The writers were faxing it in that week apparently (or perhaps there was a writers strike?)"
5,A House Divided,"There's trouble in paradise as the Xindi learn the truth about their attack on Earth. Each of the five respective species takes sides on the council and a race to the finish begins. The last couple of minutes holds an amazing CG shot of an epic space battle, a truly remarkable episode."
4,Star Trek 3rd Season,"The Zindy plotline is a good storyline. Wattching the descent of the captain from the pop fizz sanctimoniousness of Star Fleet goodness to the dark side of save-the-Earth necessity is well done.Lots of Tpal, which is always a bonus."
3,One of Best Books on dianic tradtion,This one of best books on dianic witchcraft i have seen and had the pleasure to read. and a must have for anyone who practices the dianic tradtion.Only flaw is book was biased which i favor the goddess but men do have a place and all of them should be open to dianic tradtion but they need to be balanced and this book was written in 1973 need a revision for the times
4,"Excelent for an atlas, good enough for a text","This book is simple and clear, perfect for Pediatric Surgery residents and an incredible aid for young pediatric surgeons who need an ""easy-look"" text for wards. It has everything you'll need to remember before operating on an unusual technique. Specially good with Newborn Surgery, this atlas is everything you need to ""survive"" being on duty."
4,Functional space saver,"very pleased with product overall. did have problems with the pre-determined stud locations, but made things work. initially was unsatisfied with finish of metal, looks like a cheaper splatter-painted finish, however looks fine after installation. would recommend to a friend with a small kitchen or short on storage space."
3,Poor Package and Missing items ruin a Birthday Gift,"I ordered these items for a ""crafty"" Birthday present. I was to use these to attach bottle caps to it for a personalized gift.I have to now order another set because I was shorted my quantitly of ""blonde"" chips to only #9 and there are #12 black ones....(#12 is the intended number)Very Disappointed.Kimberly(Amazon has since adjusted my order i am getting another package.)Thanks Amazon"
4,WYSIWYG,"Just standard wood checkers , nothing more or less.The box could do with a lid but otherwise they are fine."
5,"After You've Read The Rest, Use The Best!","I've read literally hundreds of design books and frankly find most of them to be long on theory and have precious little to offer by way of concrete learning and real-world usability. This book (and The Design-It-Yourself Newsletter also by Chuck - which I also own) doesn't overburden the reader with ""fluff."" It's a pleasure to find a book that tells me what I should know and need to know rather than what some ""expert"" wants to tell me. These books are practical, useful, clear, and easy-to-follow. Do yourself a favor and invest a very reasonable sum in this book (or any of Chuck's books for that matter), and you will be a better designer for it."
2,Too many birds,"While the sound of the stream is relaxing and well recorded, there are way too many birds around. The CD describes their sound as distant and faint, but that's far from accurate. The parts of the CD where all you hear is the stream alone don't add up to more than 10 minutes, and never last more than a minute. For the most part you will hear the stream and plenty of birds, rather close and sometimes very loud."
1,Cute but USELESS,"This charming hunk of plastic is sadly unable to open the pop-top variety of bottles. Instead it is shredded to bits by the serated ""teeth"" of the metal bottle cap. I never did try it on a screw top bottle as I have no trouble opening those on my own. At least it didn't cost much. Spend more and get something made of sterner stuff. I am replacing mine with the KitchenAid bottle opener."
5,"A must-have, even for a MAN!","I'm a guy and would rather work on my motorcycle than hem a pair of pants, but lately I've had to do some minor garment repairs and even help my girlfriend get some second-hand dance costumes she picked up ""cheap"" to fit her properly. Sounded simple until we had skirts and tops half torn apart with elastic showing and previously altered ""issues"" staring us in the face. A friend of mine is a professional seamstress and, seeing my frustration, recommended this book to me. She said it's a ""must-buy"" for anyone looking to sew, whether beginner or professional...and she's right! In fact, this is still her #1 go-to resource after 30+ years in the business! I just picked this book up from Amazon and, already, it has been an absolute life saver. No better resource for clearly detailed diagrams and ""how-to"" descriptions for nearly every type of stitch, seam and garment modification you could possibly use in your lifetime! Even coming from a man, this book is highly recommended!"
4,Seems exhaustive on the subject,"I haven't had a lot of time to read through it but, it seems like it covers everything so that's good!"
4,great BUTT workout,"Its a good work out for the BUTT<, you really feel it. After some time i got bored with it though and was not fun anymore, i think mainly because its so long.. Sometimes i fwd to floor work and just do those. You dont have to do the whole DVD."
4,Great book for encouraging kids to use their brains!,"Little 'Half-as-Big' feels badly because his brothers are bigger and faster until the day he uses his brain to outsmart the tiger who has come to eat them. Then they call him 'Twice-as-Smart'. We all have strengths and weaknesses, and can be respectful of others and also gain respect when we use our own talents."
4,This is an excellent adventure story.,"Dale Brown is a great story teller. He is a former air force captain who served as a navigator on heavy bombers, so he makes the flight sequences realistic.With secret super weapons and heavily modified, experimental planes, this story borders on science fiction. Unfortunately, that is its primary weakness. Mr. Brown occasionally demonstrates that he needs a refresher course in physics.All in all it's an excellent book--the first of a series (ten books to date) and I have already purchased the others."
5,crazy girl.,"asin ok moi may need a life but i love this movie,things like this really happen,i know of a similar case.so chill out,gerald mcrainey is a great actor. [jan in ohio]"
4,Energizing and Relaxing,"Thunderstorms are some the noisiest and most beautiful phenomenon of nature. On a quiet day after work or school, it is just right to turn on the sounds of a thunderstorm; not just to relax but to become energized. For some people, it may seem noisy and it would keep one alert, but the majority of this CD helps in relaxing and refreshing our minds."
2,To complex for beginners.,"I would not recommend this book for beginners. The problems are to complex and the flow charts can be hard to understand. This book may be a valuble tool for one who already knows the fundamentals about concrete design, but since it was my first class I did not enjoy this book at all. I found Nawy's sample problems assumed the reader knew to much and they left out many steps."
5,Reinfoced Concrete Fundamental Approach by Ediward G Nawy,"IT IS ONE OF THE BEST TEXT BOOK for structural Engineering Student, It is really helpful text book. Therefore, It is good idea if sturactural Engineering student use this great book!!"
4,"Pride & Prejudice, music from the motion picture",Have enjoyed learning to play the music I love from the movie I love.
3,It's okay,"It's pretty simple, there are some slight differences from the actual soundtrack, not big differences, but enough to bother me with a nagging feeling that it's not the right tune.The way they chose to write it out kind of bothers me as well, but all in all, I love the original soundtrack, and if you do too, and want to play it yourself on the piano, you should get it.But I wasn't wow-ed by it."
2,BE CAREFUL TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS!,"I got the Easy Piano version, was thrown off by the comments thinking this was the original score. MAKE SURE YOU DOUBLE CHECK before ordering which one you're getting!!!"
1,someone in Alaska,"I owned one of these magic cdrom drives and it lasted about ayear...I have had other products from magic and they are cheap. Needless to say, I now stay away from magic. Get a Plextor"
3,Acceptable book at a low price,"The arrival of the book was quick and it was acceptable, besides I could save a lot of money."
4,very ralaxing music,"I have to say that when I purchased this album I wasn't expecting it to be as soothing and relaxing as it was. This album was pretty decent and well put together. I would recommend this album to any one that enjoys reading or, relaxing."
1,Blahhhhhh,"I dont find anything funny about 2 massive body builders who act like a couple of kids. A girl who is a genious gets mixed up with 2 moron's and they are there to help save the day. That big guy who played Jaws in a couple of the Bond films was probably the best actor in the whole movie. This movie didnt appeal to me, but it probably would appeal to a much younger audience, as it was intended to i think.I found it to be silly, stupid, bad acting.... but the kids might love it, these two brothers hitting each other and pretending it hurt, when you can see that they are lightly tapping things and badly done... a goofy movie can work, but this one just didnt for me."
4,makes lap traveling easier,This seemed like a good idea I bring the car seat but my son will not stay in it. In times of turbulance it is scary that they don't make projects like this on jets already there. The one drawback I found is that it is a pain to get on and off a wiggly toddler.
3,Cute little flight vest,"Ok.. so I bought this flight vest in hope that it would help my 18 month old stay still and have hand-free on the flight to asia. We used it only one time and he didn't like it. As it says, this is toddler size but wouldnt recommend it for toddler over 29lbs, it was kinda tight and made my son felt uncomfortable. I would say it's good for infant that don't sit very well that need your support most of the time, or if your child is not very active, otherwise it wouldn't help very much!"
4,Great Product that really works!,"I have been flying with my daughter since she was 5 monthes old. I ordered the larger size so that I could use it longer and it was pretty big on her until she grew some. I have used it on ten times since then. I normally fly continental, and the flight attendants have never bothered me about it. The design of it is perfect. The loop the seatbelt goes into is just long enough to let your little one squirm a bit. On one of our flights we hit really bad turbulence where my daughter probably would have fallen off my lap if it wasn't for the vest. The only problem I had with it the first few times we used it was that the seatbelt loop was actally causing my seatbelt buckle to open. This problem is solved by ensuring that the seatbelt loop is on the side of your seat belt without the buckle."
4,No trouble to use,"Although I had read that some people weren't allowed by the flight attendants to use this product, I had no difficulty on either United or Southwest. No one bothered us about it, even during take-off and landing. The vest itself was easy to put on my 10-month-old, and gave us a little more peace of mind during turbulant conditions. It was especially nice to have it while nursing our daughter. I only wish I had gotten the smaller size- although our daughter was in the weight range for the toddler size, her shoulders were smaller than the head opening. I would recommend people err toward the smaller size when choosing this product."
3,Works great if the airlines let you use it,"I absolutely love the product. It gave me great peace of mind and helped control our little wiggle worm. Unfortunately, Northwest Airlines gave us quite a bit of grief on half our flights with them. They wouldn't let us use it and threatened to have us removed from the plane if we tried! This was even after we showed the card that specified FAA allowed its use during the inflight portion (not cruise and takeoff). So, buy and use with caution!!!"
3,The Spirit Tree,"The book arrived in first rate condition and easily on time.The base material for the book is excellent. The author of the book is extremely studied, and presents the material extremely well. I do believe that, in relation to the focus on Jungian concepts that the author focuses way too much on the 'earth mother as all' perspective, and leaps to and presents this conclusion when logic does not necessarily lead in that direction. Overall this is a good book for individuals reading about the Shinto traditions of Japan, and the bibliography of the book is very valuable for English-reading scholars interested in Shinto."
2,Disappointed in Purchase,"The products were not as good of a quality as expected. Although each shirt was the same size in the order and the tags when received, there was a significant difference in the size of each. The seller did offer replacement but I did not bother. I was also very annoyed by political advertisement for Barack Obama that was shipped with the merchandise."
5,Terrific Results from Lexmark Z55,"I will tell you right now, I am not a professional. Just a picture-taking mother of a busy 1 year old. I have tried several different types of paper and have to say I'm quite impressed with the quality of my images with this paper. Feels like a real photo and cuts nicely with my paper-cutter. Some papers don't cut cleanly. This dries quickly and makes wonderful prints. I can't wait to try the Glossy. I can not believe the difference in this paper. It is fantastic. The pictures of my daughter's 1st Birthday turned out better than I ever imagined, thanks to Kodak. Also, Amazon prices on this item can't be beat! I will be adding this to my online shopping list as a regular item to purchase. My next order will be for the Glossy, so I will let you know on that, too!"
2,Design not user friendly,"the unit keeps collapsing. The touch screen is awkward to use. sometime it works when you tape the screen other times it doesn't, you have to touch it just right. You can plug it in, put if you don't, it will eat batteries. The cheaper, hand held units are more fun and a lot easier to use."
1,Disappointed,This was purchased as a gift for my Valentine. Would not recommend this product at all. Returned item. Was not worth the money. Pleased with Amazon's return process though.
5,Movie Find,"I couldn't find this film on my Netflix or my friend's blockbuster account so I thought why not try Amazon and just buy it. It was inexpensive, in perfect condition and I got to share a special movie with a special friend."
3,Interesting subject matter...biased reporting,"Whether you will enjoy ""36 Days"" or not depends ona) Your political affiliation (the book is very pro-Gore).b) How much you enjoyed following the election controversy at the time (politcal junkies will like the comprehensive NY Times coverage).Since the New York Times endorsed Gore for president, and most of its staff tilts leftward, the coverage of Bush and his campaign team is fairly negative. Still, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it as one more source for info regarding the historic 2000 election.Besides, the liberal spin is less annoying because Bush wins in the end."
2,Why not title it 'We love Gore'?,"A long and dreary collection on NYT 'reportage' and opinion. If you were unfortunate enough to read the 36 days of NYT coverage, you will find nothing new. If you want to laugh at the ... attempt at 'unbiased' reporting, this is a rich vein.The time is long gone when the Times was anything other than a rag spouting hard-left views."
5,I just want to cry!,"You can't imagine how it feels being a Shiflett, and finding such fine musicians in the blood line! When I enjoy my Virginia ham this Christmas, you can bet that this CD's going to be spinning out the tunes. Every real Shiflett owes it to himself to have one of these albums! The fine crafted music, and the sentimental lyrics cut to the bone! It's the essence of what being a Shiflett is all about!"
1,My review,I just did not like this video. It may be betterfor you when you view this DVD. I did not like the content.
5,Great pictures,"I recently upgraded from an Olympus 3030 to a 5mp camera. After looking around, I bought the HP based on some samples pictures that looked clear, sharp and full of colour. The 3X zoom is good and the controls are easy to use. I mostly use it as a point and shoot but the manual in the camera has already made me a better photographer since I learn soemthing while taking the pictures. The style is the ebst but it an easy to sue camera that takes great pictures. I read other reviews about battery life but have not had the same problems. Highly recommended!"
2,May be good outdoors but in low light it's poor,"This camera seems to take good shots outdoors in well lit areas but I use it mostly indoors and rarely like the effect that the flash produces so I often turn it off. This then produces blurry shots (I assume the lens is staying open to compensate for the low light) even if someone is just moving thier arm it most often comes out as a big blur. I also seem to notice an overall high level of noise in these situations, sometimes even with the flash. I don't think I'd be buying an HP camera again. If you plan on using it outdoors in the sun it may work great for you. I personally don't like the controls either."
3,The Great and the bad,"I really love this camera. I got it two years ago for christmas, and I can't explain how much I love this thing! The only problems I have are that its impossible to take pictures indoors. Like at a concert or graduation or something like that. And the battery life sucks. But if you purchase rechargable batteries, it works much better."
5,Compare Prices,"Just look at the options then compare this camera to any other with the same options. You will be hard pressed to find a better camera for the price. I have owned many HP products and I am not disappointed with this one. Very easy to use, great picture, and outstaining quality when you print on a photo printer.... Nice camera which price is unbeatable on any web site.BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,too small,I was dissappoited in the size of this book. Only a few pages and very basically done. Was not impressed.
2,Not a very good speaker...,"I originally purchased a set of Bose 301s about fifteen years ago when I was in high school. I inherited the Bose center channel from a friend and have been looking to replace it for a long time. It's not a terrible speaker, it's just a lot of money for something that produces slightly average sound. You'll notice that people who were generous to this speaker claim that Bose is known for exceptional sound quality - but I challenge anyone to find an audiophile who would agree with that statement. Bose products are typically over-marketed and price fixed products built on technology straight out of the 70s. I strongly suggest anyone looking to purchase a home audio system turn to the web and do their research. For a lot less, you can get a lot more (e.g., Paradigm)."
1,Don't get it!,"I have to agree with the review that mentioned the 22 db difference. I got this center channel to match my 601, which sounds pretty good, to my 201, which sound okay but, for what I paid was in itself a rip off. I tell you I can barely hear the dialogue. I had the db cranked all the way up, and my left and right speakers as well as my sub db's turned way down. It just doesn't make sense. Bose took me. The 601 were worth the money, but their bacon is in the center channel. I could have done better with a fifty dollar book shelf. Anyone writing anything positive about this speaker either owns stock in this company, works for the company, or owns the company. Don't be the next victim. Sincerely said."
5,Completes the package,"After 20 years with an old receiver, I replaced it and found out that a center speaker was needed for genuine surround sound. I already own Bose speakers, so I assumed the Bose center speaker was the right choice. I was right, it is crystal clear. The sound is great! It was a little pricey, but I believe sometimes you get what you pay for."
4,Good Buy,I needed this book fast due to class beginning early. I got it on time and was able to start using it.
4,Love those old Dracula movies,"this movie is a real thriller - a precursor to ""Taste The Blood of Dracula"", another recent purchase I made. This is one of the few times in the horror genre that this has been done (to my knowledge & I am no expert.) Christopher Lee is the one and only ""Dracula"" for me. He is very convincing in an attractive way, drawing his victims into his ""will"" with that come hither look. If you really want to enjoy these two movies, get them both and watch them one after the other. Quite entertaining."
4,One of the Decent Ones in the Series. . . But not the Best,"Sequel to ""Dracula Prince of Darkness"" this one takes place one year after the events of the last one.We Begin with a priest making a discovery of a body of a woman stuffed in the belfry of the local church in the town below Castle Dracula. A Monsignor bewildered that nobody is in church goes to the Priest who is scared out of his wits because at sunset the shadow of the castle touches the church so to make the towns people feel better the two holymen march up to the castle with a huge cross to seal the doors so that his sprit can never leave again however the priest stays behind and gets lost and falls down a hill on to a frozen stream under the ice is Count Dracula from the events of ""Prince"" the priest hits his head and blood seeps in to the ice and soon Dracula Has Risen From The Grave"
3,OK film is a little improvement over the first sequel,"A little better this time around, although having Professor Van Helsing would have made it a nicer film to watch. At least this time, the Count actually speaks.If you are a fan of these Hammer films, stick with this and the other period films. This is one to have for your collection if you are a die hard fan like myself. If not, at least rent this one at Halloween for a night of horror."
1,dracula has risen from the grave,"this dvd will not play on my dvd or computer and i have had others to play it on there dvd player but it does not work, the dvd looks good but will not play i dont no what to do about please let me no thanks."
5,lowest cost and its all that,"i'm from halifax nova scotia and iam glad to say that even my apex ad-1500 dvd player as set my goals in getting a dvd player i wouldn't trade it for another one. i knew my tv wouldn't set up without the rf modulator. yes the buttoms are small but you get use to it. i found the funcations easy to use and i'm happy with the zoom in not x2 but x4 it all depends sometimes on the dvd your playing as well so those who want the ""lowest cost,easy steps,who always dreamed about having a dvd"" GET THIS ONE ITS ALL THAT"
1,bad DVD player and very bad service!,I don't recommend this company (APEX) or their DVD players. The player didn't work with many of our DVDs and the customer service was the worst! If you want a low-quality player and like waiting on hold while you pay for the call then buy this product.
1,May be a fine DVD Player But I never Found Out,This DVD player may be a fine unit but I never found out. On Christmas Day I connected the DVD to find that the disc tray would not open. I am not the only person with this problem. In fact there are some individuals on Apex's message board that claimed to have bought 2 units and both had defective disc trays.I am not telling you to avoid this product but I would advise you to carefully research and visit Apex's message board to see what others are saying....
2,Breaks easily after short usage,"Please don't buy Apex. It is the only electronics product that I have purchased that breaks in less than 30 days. My Apex stopped working for DVD's after seeing 20 movies. The laser went out of line, so it has be shipped in for repairs. I am going to get my money back and buy from a reliable company."
4,"AD-1500, mixed experience","I've had two of these so far and encountered a number of others, and my experience has been mixed. Their performance is great, they play anything thrown at them and I love the hackability of it, however it seems Apex got hit by the bad capacitor fiasco that plagued computer peripheral makers for several years. Every single one of these units has started acting up eventually and on every one the problem has been a single failed capacitor in the power supply. If you open it up you'll likely see it bulged at the top and possibly leaking. Now this is about a 50 cent part and it's not hard to change *but* most customers will likely have to find a technician to replace it as it requires soldering. So in the end, great player for me since I can fix them myself, but I hesitate to recommend them to non-technical customers unless they've been refurbished already since in my experience this capacitor *will* fail."
2,Would not recommend this item at all.,"You definatly get what you pay for. After about 6 months of using this player the sound became terrible. After checking to make sure the audio connection to my t.v. was ok, I found that it was not the connection, but the player. The sound works fine for awhile then it starts to get gravely and cuts out. If you want a DVD player that is not too [costly], but you have to take into consideration that you might not hear what is going on in the movie."
2,Great price!,"But you get what you pay for. Very few options, and the quality is poor. For just a little more cash, ($149 to $199) you get a much better product with lots of options. If you do get this DVD player, in just a few weeks you will wish you spent the extra $60-$110 bucks!!"
2,This book convinced me to NOT go to Mexico,"Nothing in this book got me excited about going to Mexico. The natural attractions of the U.S. seem to be far more numerous and spectacular. The author was stretching to fill a book on Mexico's natural attractions - he covers ruins, city parks, and agricultural enterprises. The photographs in the book do not convey any beauty of Mexico."
5,Beautiful stands,These pair of stands not only looks good but helps to create better home theater sound.These stands are fantastic.
5,BOSE stands,The Bose stands that I purccased are exactly the same as BOSE sells. What a great savings.
5,perfect,The Bose universal floor stands are just what I was looking for.Last year we purchased the Bose home theatre and these stands happen to be a perfect match for the speakers. We have the stands on wooden floor and they are very sturdy. The design is sleek and gives a modern look.We are very happy with the purchase.
4,Stands for the speakers,"These stands work great, and they came at a great price. I bought these to use with my Bose system, and they work great. Amazon had a great price on them (half of what anywhere else advertised). If it wouldn't have been for the price, I would have probably got different ones. These stands hide the wires really well, were easy to assemble, look very nice. However, there is really nothing special about them. They also are a fixed height, meaning no adjustment up and down, but the height is pretty much where they need to be."
5,Compatible,"These are perfect for my cinemate system! They appear advertised for the cube speakers, but on the box there are all the different speakers that it can hold. They look great and help improve the sound!"
1,poor quality--avoid,"We've had this model for about 3 years--and last week, the handle to open the door simply fell off. Maytag charges $129 for a service call, and the replacement part is more than $200 (you have to buy the entire door assembly--not just the handle).Interestingly, at the end of my call, the Maytag phone rep helpfully asked if I needed to buy any filters or other accessories.Um, no thanks. We'll be replacing the unit...not with a Maytag,"
3,Quirky Fun,"Good French comedy, if you like French comedy. Silly, and it asks a bit much of the audience in terms of patience and suspension of you know what, but fun."
4,Fills a void,Just like one of the other reviewers mentioned.... it fills in where Canon left off. While not perfect definately has saved my camera from the light taps against concrete and walls when i have it around my neck.
5,Love this DVD,I've watched it several times and never gets tired of watching it. :) this is better than the World Tour DVD
5,"I Am... Yours, An Intimate Performance At Wynn Las Vegas (blu-ray)","Excellent performance! Beyonce at her best. Video and audio quality superb. Filmed in wide aspect ratio ( 2.35 to 1 ) which was perfect for wide stage. Also might note that stage lighting was excellent.... and the dancers.. well that's another story. Might I say... extremely talented and sexy? And for the girls out there, the guys looked great too."
1,Useless,"Not good for what I bought it for(copying program for a class), not even good for backing up my computer. Absolutely useless.P.S.Neither me or my prof are using a mac, I have a Vaio operating on vista, and he's probably using 7 or some kind of lunix"
3,"Better than most, but not the best in the series","i've bought every reggae gold since '95 and compared to '95, they have all been lackluster. '99 was better than most of the previous editions (96-98), but not better than other reggae/dancehall compilations available."
2,I was very dissapointed with this CD.,"I love Reggae and Dancehall music, but this CD was just HORRIBLE! The Reggae Gold '98 was so much better than this.This was a waste of money and if I could return I would. The songs were bad. I think out of the whole CD there were MAYBE two or three that I liked. Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage."
5,Evil Clowns Will Make You Laugh,"My daughter bought me a tee shirt with these same words down the front. The beauty of this short phrase is that it calls to mind all the most horrible dreams you ever had as a child. Having those same dreams as a result is ludicrous, but funny as long as you are NOT having dreams about evil killer clowns. Everyone should have this phrase somewhere just to remind themselves that most of the time the world is not as bizarre as movies, television and books might otherwise lead you to believe it is. Just do, not, fall, asleep."
5,WOW! Fantastic quality,"I was very surprised by the quality of the case when it came in. it has a beautiful finish all over. it opens smoothly and closes tightly. the latches are great, they have a nice compound movement that makes them very easy to open, no fiddling. i can't believe the quality of the case for the price. i would expect to pay closer to $300 for something of that quality. very satisfied."
3,Return,"I didn't even get a chance to give it to my grandson. Tried to put it together and the front wheel will not go into the fork. Looks like I have to repackage and send back. Not looking forward to that. Adding additional comment. Called the 800 number for service and they were very nice, going to replace the fork at no charge to me. Very happy."
5,"A Classic Comedy, Bud-dy!","Dave and Stoney, two high school geeks, dig up a cave man in Dave's back yard. Played by Brendan Frazier, 'Link', as they call him goes to school and does normal '90's stuff. Eventually, the truth is revealed about him, and people like him even more! A classic movie, with classic quotes, and two hilarious scenes in a row. The scene at the Food Mart, followed by the scene at Magic Mountain."
5,Classic Movie!,Since owning this movie I've watched it a good 3 times. I love all the corny 90's movies! Since it was used I haven't had any issues with it.
5,comfortable and gets the job done,these are the best breast shells on the market - they can hold about 2 oz on each side. They come with both the ventilated cups and the nonventilated ones. I use the ones without the holes to prevent bending over and milk spilling. They are great for wearing around the house.
5,A Lifesaver!!!,"Initially, I purchased the Avent breast pads, thinking they would suffice. However, I found them to be itchy against my already irritated breasts. These breastshells were the answer!!! Not only do they catch all that embarassing leaking milk, but they soothe away irritation!"
2,Wasn't sure what these were,I ordered these thinking they were the shields that go on a breast pump horn. I was wrong. Not sure what to do with these now.
5,much better than milk saver,"maybe it's because I dont have a long torso but I found this product much more comfortable than the milk saver. Unless breast milk is flowing abundantly, the Avent Breast shells is much more reasonable and cheaper to boot"
1,Yankee Doodle Dandy Soundtrack,Can you say AWFUL? The sound quality is reminiscent of my childhood days playing my LP's on my Fisher Price record player!Even if you find this one on a clearance table for 50 cents STAY AWAY!
3,Yankee Doodle Dandy Review,"It's an old movie with an old soundtrack, but I loved the movie, I love the music, and I'm very happy with my purchase."
3,difficult to put on,I wish they could make this shoes somewhat easier to put on. That earns this product a 3 star. Everything else is superb so far.
3,Good seller- Nice looking product but poor quality!,"That's the 3rd pair of this kind I buy. The vendor is very good and shipped the product quikly. Those shoes are extremly nice looking and very comfortable because light and soft, but unfortunatly the front seam is weak. So weak that after a fairly short time it breaks and the shoes become useless!This product would easily get a 5 start if the seam was holding.Be aware that the lifetime of these shoes is short..."
4,You'll Never Look At the Movie The Same Way Again,"The Sound Of Music is a musical filled with well-thought out, and catchy songs as well as memorable characters who are easy to relate to. This book takes you behind the scenes with Charmian Carr, who played almost all little girls' favorite character in the movie, the sixteen year old Liesl Von Trapp. In this book, you will be presented with personal information about Charmian, as well as photos from the movie set, fun stories that happened while making the movie, information about the makers of the movie, how Liesl got the part, and why she almost didn't, and so much more! Though rather boring in parts, I finished this book with a smile on my face, and recommend it to everyone who loved The Sound of Music. You will never look at the movie the same way again after reading this book!"
4,Even if you haven't seen the movie....,"OK, I confess! I'm probably one of the few people in the US who hasn't seen The Sound of Music (at least never beyond the first commercial when it's shown on TV). Being a perennial grouch, I've convinced myself that it's probably going to be tedious and corny. Nevertheless, I found this book delightful reading. My partner bought it for me when we were in Stowe, VT, on a hiking trip (they've got an entire Gift Shoppe there devoted to von Trapp stuff!), and I finished it pretty much in one sitting. Ms. Carr gives us a lot of insight into how movies are made; she sounds like an intelligent and perceptive person, and one who didn't get corrupted by her contact with Hollywood. Her account explains many of the reasons why people enjoy this movie.... maybe I'll give it another try next time it's on!"
1,THE SOUNDS OF SNORING,"She may have played the eldest of the von Trapp tikes -- the one who was 16 going on 17 -- but Charmian Carr has written a book that won't last more than 16 seconds in your hands. The most shocking ""revelation:"" that one of her favorite things was pigging out on fattening foods in Salzburg. The sound you now hear? The book slamming shut."
5,A Wonderful Book!,"If you are a Sound of Music fan, then Forever Liesl is a must read! I enjoyed reading about the making of the movie and how it has affected the lives of many people. The book really made me appreciate the movie even more. It was great to learn that Charmian and her six ""celluloid siblings"" have kept in touch over the years. Definitely one of My Favourite Things!"
4,"easy, easy hands-free",I'm not techy but have easily been able to figure out the basics of using this w/o reading the directions. Only criticism is that the fit is a bit loose - it can move out of position if I turn my head around quickly. I'm amazed that people hear me as well as they do on this headset - it's great to be hands-free and wire-free.
2,Motorola Headset HS820,My first unit was DOA. It was replaced by Amazon without any hassles. This unit has troble keeping its bond with the phone. The sound fron the ear piece is not clear. I wouldn't but this one again.
3,"Decent Headset, cheap","It works and simple does the job for the money, good incoming sound however I would not say outgoing voice quality is good enough for communication."
2,Good Product - While It Worked,"This headset worked really well for me - good volume, clear, very little wind noise. Then it suddenly stopped charging. Motorola replaced it under warranty with another model but I'm not as happy with it."
2,Low Quality Sound,"You can't use this headset while driving because it doesn't transmit sound well. If you use use this headset to call landline,it's quite acceptable, however, if you use this headset to call cell phone, it's very annoying."
4,Good product for mobile phones but not suitable for other devices like laptop,I bought this headset just one month back and it is working good.Its performance was not satisfactory when I tried it with my laptop for chatting purpose but it is a great product for mobile phones. The voice is crystal clear and I consider it a good deal in $30 price.
4,Bluetooth Headset-Gloss Black,"Good product, simple to use. fits snuggly on the ear and enhances the sound of the Razr very well. The linking of the products took a little playing around with to get to work but anybody with any cell phone experience should be able to muddle through the process without too much difficulty."
1,"echo, echo. echo","I bought it as gift. I got sick of my friend talking to me on her muddled speakerphone so I figured it would be good for both of us. $30 , can't go wrong right? Well when you hear your voice echo back to you after every sentence you will regret buying this headset. I should have payed attention to the other similiar reviews on here. Trust me, no BS, the echo is bad. Very annoying. Not sure if 850 has this issue but the 820 sure does. The price is great but I wish I spent more and got one that didn't echo."
5,SWEEET,"Just received this today... 5 seconds to pair to my Moto V505 phone. Great reception. Great looks. Easy to use. Great when driving and walking around (saves on the neck aches). And the ""wow"" factor when people ask you what the heck it is, lol."
3,"Works great, fits horrible","I wish I would've read the reviews before purchasing my first bluetooth. It looks great, the sound is awesome, works perfect, but it is way too loose on my ear. At first I thought I just had small ears, but then I read other complaints and there are far too many of the same complaints to be a coincidence. So if you have big ears, this product may be perfect. I can't turn my head to quickly or even tilt it or it'll fall off. Good price, but now I have to buy another one that fits. Any recommendations?"
3,Overall good for $30,"Overall I guess it is good for the $30 price tag since it is $80.00 in stores. This is my first Blue tooth head set and I like the technology but its downfall is that you have to speak up and speak clear or the other person can't hear you and if by chance the other person says something when you are talking neither goes through, also doesn't work to well in noisy places like the store because it picks up all the noise around you just as well as your own voice. Still like it though! :-)"
2,Unsatisfied,"I purchased this headset because it seemed like a very good deal. Once I got it home the problems began. It paired very nicely with my Razr V3c, but after that everything went downhill. It dropped numerous calls, wouldn't stay on my ear, and died very quickly. I decided to send it back for a full refund afterwards. I don't think I need a bluetooth headset that bad."
2,Earpiece too loose...,"I purchased the Motorola HS820 as my first bluetooth headset based on price and reviews. I was impressed with the clarity and compatibility w/ my Motorola SLVR, however the earpiece did not have a tight fit. No matter how I postition it, it felt loose and often just fell right off my ear. I returned it hoping to find a headseat that had a good fit."
2,Not Really a great headset,"It's a great deal, so i jumped on it. But was truly disappointed. I've so far summed up Motorola products as well really really poor. I own a Razar, wish i could return that! But this headset, thinking it's from motorola would work well with my phone, but no. It's on my belt clip, and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away, signal is weak, and then disconnets. To me that's strange. It's also surprising that this happens randomly, so it's kinda annoying, b/c you can't anticipate it. Kinda annoying when driving, b/c you rely on the headset to work properly. Also get the static noise which is weird, b/c it shouldn't do that. especially when driving."
3,Simply works...but low volume,The headphone works fine. Works superbly with Razr and also works in close proximity with my laptop. Only problem I face with it is the volume.I'll always wish to trade it with something having more volume.
2,ECHO Can U hear me now?,"I purchased this product for my Verizon phone as a replacement for another Bluetooth headset (same manufacturer) that also echos. Everyone I call complains (incessantly) that all they can hear is their voice echoing back. I am unable to have a conversation. I enjoy the handsfree capabilty, but I hate the complaints. Now I just have to find a ""good"" Bluetooth."
1,Not as expected.,I bought this bluetooth to go with my Treo and I was disappointed. Maybe its what you get for that price. There was so much disturbance and the sound quality was so bad that I have to stop using it.
2,Broke after 2 months,This piece was working fine for two months ..then just stoped working for no reason....The light wont turn on when i plug in the charger so i know it's the unit...Will be sending it back and buying a better brand
4,Good Buy,"Excellent VFM (value for money). Easy to use, extremely simple set up. Good sound quality.Could do better with sound volume but it is generally adequate for regular conversation. Haven't heard any one complaining about an echo, as some other users had mentioned in their reviews."
1,Motorola HS820 Bluetooth,"Will not connect to phone, junk, AT&T; Tech could not get it to connect either.Should have know it would be junk when it arrived in a zip lock baggie instead of Motorola Packaging.Live and learn!!!"
5,A Fascinating Blend of Fact and Fiction,"Martin really nails the story in this part fact part fictional account of the life of George Washington. The style of the book is one I have not seen very often. In lieu of chapters, there are fictional narratives of those who knew Washington best. Some narratives are pages long, while others are a few sentences. Teaming one of the most famous men in American history with a gripping writing style make this another William Martin success! The ending is just as surprising as the rest of the book, and I cannot wait to pick up the next book by Martin."
3,it depends...,"Okay, I love the older SP albums a lot. I also understand that this album was completed after the death of one member... so take that into consideration. Also, they are getting old. Physically, when people get older they are less [mad], less insperational and less risky (for the most part... don't bombard me with counter-arguements... I just think it's what happened here. These guys are tired.)On the plus side, the engineering on this album is good. My borhter has one of those sick, evil stereos in his car and when he heard the guitar blast in n song 1 he stole the cd from me and managed to blow his speakers because he said ""it sounds to goos to turn down."" That opening guitar is really one of the best things I've ever heard at full volume in my life.Either way, it's not the best Puppy stuff. I lost the cd a while back, or someone stole it, and I forgot about it. Maybe it's worth it for that intro-guitar-boom, when I can afford such frivolous things."
4,The Letter by Judy Garland,The Letter tells a story with singing by Judy and naration by John Ireland. It makes for great listening.
2,What a pity...,...because Judy`s voice is at the vocal best and the project must have been seen as an intertesting 1...But it turns out to be nothing short but low-trash 50`s saccharine idiotic romance.... It feels like its premises has been stolen by a reaaaaaaaaaaaaaal bad pulp fiction....This is not(with The Harvey Girls)a Judy Garland project I will include in my collection of her....
1,What a terrible book,"I really liked the first couple books in this series. I was hooked on ""How few Remain"" but there is no imagination or creativity left in this series. I weep for it. Seriously. It was that bad. I can write better than this. I will never read another Turtledove book."
1,Too 70's ish,"This is a fantastic series, and the Grappelli discs are a major reason why. All the earlier Grappelli discs in this series are excellent. This one, however, is too much a product of its time. The backup musicians are horrible and Stephane's playing suffers. It is interesting to compare this to the even later disc he did with Grisman, which is fantastic."
1,Don't waste your money,"At least in New Mexico, these and other sound repellers do not work. Neither does granular deterrent. Traps work IF you find someone who sets them properly."
1,Pocket gophers laugh as they dig by it,"We are in Colorado and are plagued with pocket gophers. We have had these pest repellers in our lawn for over 2 years and I have yet to see any difference in the hungry pests digging patterns. I think they chuckle and use it as a beacon to know where in the garden are the tastier roots and bulbs.Maybe it works for some people because they have moles. I bet a lot of people don't even know what they have in their lawn - for months, my wife and I debated whether we had pocket gophers or voles. I know we have pocket gophers because we've captured and released over a dozen.These don't work. What works is the wash, catch and release program. My wife takes the hose, floods all of their tunnels and air holes. Sometimes it takes hours to get one to surface and doesn't always work. Once they surface, scoop them up in a bucket and take to a nearby national forest, open space or park.Also works to build garden boxes with tough wire mesh on the bottom.Good luck!"
1,amazon stinks never got the product minus 8 stars,"this is the 3 or 4th time things have been screwed up at amazon , got my coffee grinder, sent email about b buzzer no response"
5,Beenie will definetly heal us with this one!!!!,"This New CD from beenie will be all that, cause I already heard cuts from it. If you go to vprecords.com you can get all the latest reggae sounds including the ones out now. The poeple he got on this one is A.R.P., little kirk, Jon. b., Angie Martinez, and More. The song ""the doctor"" is banging and he will be running the airwaves again with this one. Don't sleep, only a week until it comes out. And Reggae Gold 99 will be banging too.Get this!!! You won't regret."
3,Defective,"By all indications, this should be a solid product. Unfortunately though, there was a sizable hole in the sheathing for the cable when I received it in the mail. It did not look like something that happened in transit. It simply looked like it hadn't been properly sheathed in manufacturing."
3,A Nice Collection,"This is one of this genres well known players. Most of the recordings on this disc are very good, with a few being from older and live varieties. I wish they had done a better job at remastering a few of the tracks. All in all a very lively and diverse CD."
4,flawed but delicious,"In this fourth novel, private detective Kinsey Millhone is hired for routine search-and-deliver work, but before she can begin on the case her client drowns. She decides to look into his death, first on her own and then in the employ of the client's daughter. She quickly discovers that the drowning may not have been accidental, and between creditors, buddies from jail, and wives, there are more than enough suspects.""D is for Deadbeat"" has more flaws than previous Kinsey installments, and sometimes the detective's motives make little sense. But the book is pleasurable reading, and the thrill of the chase overwhelms any flaws in the plot."
3,Not her best!,"Ok so it really deserves 3 in a half stars while 4 is too many. IMO I thought that it was a slow moving book. Not much action happened until near the end. I just finished Evidence which also starts off slow but it definitly picks up, while Deadbeat I felt remained slow. Granted, in a Grafton novel slow really isn't as slow as other novels. This books saving grace was Kinsey. She was as hard-headed and wise-cracking as ever. The funeral scence was hysterical. The ending was also a saving grace. It was a twist ending,though I figured it out,mainly because others reviews said what a twist it was. A must-read for fans of Grafton/Kinsey though."
4,D is for Delcious,"As Sue Grafton winds her way through the alphabet, her stories are getting better and better. I have read up to ""V"", her latest, and can't wait to read the rest."
2,boring,"couldn't get past the first few pages---and I am one of those people who is diligent in reaeding through tough beginnings. Heck I've read ""Hawaii"" twice. But, this book I do not recommend. If you read it and find my remarks invalid, good for you."
5,Compelling...Beautiful...Intriguing,"A.A. Attanasio is a master at his craft of spinning epic tales.Wyvern will whisk you away into the steaming jungles of Borneo during the European/Islamic hegemony of the early 1600's. Once there you will journey with a young ""soul catcher"" (sorcerer/healer/medicine man) in his quest for survival."
5,Terrific,This is an epic with scope and irony to spare. Any serious reader will find the time well spent. One of the best books I've read. For mature audiences only. Watch for the surprise ending!
1,Poorly Updated; Poorly Edited,"I purchased this book for a class, and so far I am very disappointed in this book. For being a recent edition, some of the information is very out of date. For example, the book references BountyQuest as a means of searching for prior art in patents, yet fails to realize that the BountyQuest website shut down in 2002 (remember, this edition of the book was (c) 2010). Also, I'm only 4 chapters in and I have already found some glaring spelling and editing errors in the book (""little"" spelled ""lilttle"").The text of the book is well-written and easy to understand, but better editing and updating would have made me a much more satisfied purchaser.Update: Also found ""Mastercard"" spelled ""Matercard."" Whoops..."
4,This girl rocks!,"Her voice is amazing, never hard on the ears, and listening to her you can just get lost. Her lyrics are not cheesy, the music is not predictable. I hope to hear more from Bec!"
5,Great buy,Great buy. It is a simple sturdy barrel and come with a wrench to tighten the caps. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,Excellent pot rack,"I bought this to replace an older rack. The workmanship is well done. It is solid, sturdy and comes with all the required hardware."
2,Dissapointing,"Lisa 'Left eye 'Lopes is a good rapper. Well she WAS one because she died in spring 2002 at a car accident. i think TLC'S ""L"" has made herself a dream come true with this solo album. And I am sure that big tLC-Fans will like it but I was really dissapointed when I listened to it because all the songs sound the same somehow. Even the single is just an ordinary song and it'S just nothing special. The only really good song is ""A new star is born"" (wich deals with the death of her father I think) It'S sad that she hadn't the chance to make another album because I know that she can do better what she proved on the tLC-album ""Fainmail""."
2,Too Bad that this album is her only solo,"All I have to say is that this album is not one to run out and buy. There are two songs that stand out. Let Me Live and the ""Untouchables"" ft. 2pac."
4,LA Reid Opportunist,"I can't believe that Reid would put this album out now, when I specifically remember him shelving it and only releasing it in Europe."
5,fantastic Casualtie's release,"This is the strongest album the Casualtie's have released yet. I have been a fan of the Casualtie's since the Underground Army album and they just keep belting out fierce and raw street punk with horrid vocals only a punk rocker could tolerate. True the Casualtie's have a fashion sense , so did every oi! and street band from 1980-1986 pretty much , and that's basically where their sound is paying tribute too. And i've been a Casualtie's fan for a long time and I don't dress like them and wear GBH patches , and I've never seen Jorge make fun of anyone at a show either..well anyway this release is really good the best tracks are the opening and closing ""Nightmare"" and ""Made in NYC"" (a tribute to Joey Ramone). Up The Punx!!!"
3,The Casualties:they try too hard,"I am a fan of the Casualties but only the early years.I got this cd at Sam Goody back in March.I liked it alot at first but once I started listening to the early years...I don't like it much anymore.I do like their spanish material though.Honestly, this is an awsome record but once one listens to their early stuff, this record looks like a steaming pile of dump."
1,funny cd,"this is one of those cds u keep around to throw in on a sad night to laugh to. Sit around and put die hards in and have a good laugh at a band that should have stopped 3 albums ago. The cover is funny, songs are funny, and their hair is really funny. Catch you on the warp tour........lol"
4,Nice fondue pot,"I have had a good many fondue pots over the years and think this is really pretty good. I think it gets quite hot. We mostly do oil oriented fondues, meat, shrimp, chicken and this really sizzles. I have never had a problem with not enough heat. I do not care for the cord however.It does come off rather easily and I find that annoying."
2,Rival Stainless Steel Fondue Maker,"Nice set, mine steams to heat up too fast, for example- my fondue begins to BOIL on warm -which ruins your fondue, so I keep it below warm- then it's hard to get it warm enough. The set does have a small book with recipes, I was hoping for more recipes that are standard for this set. Extension cord is very short- need to be close to an outlet. I think I'll just keep trying. It's frustrating when you spend over $20 on cheese and it doesn't work out with company on the way over to your house."
5,Strong Tripod,"I purchased this tripod to use with a grab and go telescope. It is solidly built, extremely versatile, and convenient for what I use it for. I can mount a short tube 100mm refractor telescope, with either a diagonal, barlow and lense or a camera adapter and dslr and the tripod will handle the load easily. Perfect for my use."
5,Wonderful Music to enjoy,The sound and clarity of the DVD version impressed me so much at a model home I had to buy it.
2,"High expectations, low talent","I have always been a sucker for a knight-in-shining armour movie, but with this film, even as a child, I had to draw the line. Robert Wagner is a bad actor, always has been, always will be. His Aleta, Janet Leigh is beautiful, graceful, and eager, but even she cannot arouse from our Sir Valiant more than his open-mouthed, handsome, vacant stare. James Mason, the consumate actor, must have wondered what he had done to deserve working with such amateurs. Still, as a child, I was enthralled and thrilled by the sets, costumes, and derring-go. It was just the wooden young man as Valiant that set my teeth on edge. I was much happier to curl on the couch and read my grandfather's original news paper Sunday comics collection of the Prince Valiant adventures, along with his passionate and adventurous family, instead!"
3,Prince Valiant,"I have not seen this flick in over forty years, it was a buzz to watch and see the progress movies have made and casting of stars has taken. Certaily all the male leads in this movie were not the barbarian or hero stachure we have come to know today. the sets were quite good for its day . All in all a fun viewing and fun to talk about."
1,Typical 1950's Era Movie,"This movie has some wonderful scenery, and Robert Wagner is always watchable, but it can be corny in spots. I remember seeing it when I was young, so I enjoy being able to see it again in a wide-screen version."
2,Not exactly Prince Valiant,"This adaptation of Harold Foster's fine comic strip is quite disappointing. While the film has high production values -- good costumes and sets and some engaging action -- the story is slow (and departs annoyingly and unnecessarily from the strip) and the actors preposterous. Robert Wagner is especially miscast in the lead role. He spends most of the movie scowling, or looking confused. Sterling Hayden is an amusingly odd choice for Gawaine: an Arthurian hero via the wild west. I can't recommend this to any but the most die-hard swashbuckler aficionado."
5,One of the Best Knight Movies made,This was much better than expected. One of the best movies about medieval knights I have seen. Recommend it to fans of knights.
4,horse,I was very disappointed not to be able to watch this movie as it did not work in any of our dvd players stating (NOT REGIONS CODE).I have seen this movie a few years ago and loved it ordered from your company but alas it did not work and had to be returned. I love this movie and wish I could get a copy that would work here in Australia.
3,Great,"Ok I would recommend, however the tire starts getting flat quickly and you might need to up grade after some tiime."
3,First Ryan Moore Solo Outing,"This was the first solo outing by The Legendary Pink Dots' Ryan Moore. It's an experiment in electronic reggae-style dub and basically lays out the sound that Moore would explore more successfully on later albums, where he refines his sound and expands his sonic pallette. Here, the songs are unfortunately fairly indistinguishable from one another and the sound is a bit thin. I'd recommend ""Horsie"" instead. Ryan Moore is also fantastic live if you ever catch him opening for LPD."
2,thumbs down,"I thought this was going to be an interesting movie. I've seen most of Audrey's movies and this one has to be the worse so far. It is pretty boring, slow moving, and the plots just doesn't grab you. Similar themes are explored through her other movies, but are done much better. it doesn't have the effect that any of her other movies have. It's just a rather strange movie,that I don't plan on watching again."
2,I didn't care for it,No action so Dolph Lundgren fans won't be happy. No acting so Art film lovers won't be happy. as David Soul is laughable as a Neo-Nazi coach silly and violent but lifeless action scenes ruin the film. give it a rental if your a Dolph-in fan others run away!
5,"""Smokey Cool""","This is one of those albums that when you que up is always the topic of discussion. ""Who is this?"" they all ask. This music is very ""other-world dub"". Some people find dub boring and repetitious...Horsie is neither. Full of deep rich bass and just plain ""cool"" bass lines. If I had to describe his music I would say ""spacey narcotic dub"" - I stress the narcotic. Ryan Moore is Twilight Circus and he is one strange character...you would never guess this music was performed by a caucasion Canadian. I'm not sure about the amazon cd's but I know that if you buy the cd's from his web page www.twilightcircus.com, it comes personalized with Ryan's crazy drawings. Where else do you buy a cd from an artist and make the money order out to him personally? Highlights are Romy, Horsie, Carousel, Rock Salt. This is easily the most accessable Twilight Circus release to date...but all of them have a place in my player. Buy with confidence."
5,"""Just right"" balance of comfort and support","These boots worked great for remote mountainous Thailand. Terrain was steep, with lots of rocks, trails, and hard-packed clay. I had tried on a Merrell sneaker style and the more rigid Keen Gypsum boot, but these seemed like the ""just right"" balance of comfort (and being able to feel the ground) and support. They didn't dissapoint. My only gripe is that they don't grip at all on slippery surfaces like wet rocks. (Another boot I had with a Vibram sole did the same thing). For that, I had to go barefoot like the local residents do!"
5,Most comfortable hiking boot I've ever worn.,"I was steered toward this boot by a friend. Very lightweight and flexible, which makes it suitable for run and gun type hunting or general hiking. Very little break-in time required."
4,the best boot i every had.,"My new Keen waterproof boots are just that.They look great and are the right size.I keep them on all day long ,hate to take them off.They have very good prices on them at Amazon.I'm 67 and walk a lot in my boots that feel great. Larry E. Stults"
3,I second that,"Reading the above review, my experience is exact. The black rubber on the upper toe area separated from the rest of the shoe in less than a dozen hiking miles. The shoe is very lightweight and has proven to be very comfortable and surprisingly sturdy for its weight. I even found it durable enough to take on a desert backpack trip. But the quality issue is making me hesitate to buy these Mids. What to do..."
3,It's ok,"It ok. I developed two hot spots directly above my ankle bones. Maybe I need to be tougher, but my other hiking boots never did this. Next time I will try two pairs of socks."
4,Good shoe for the price.,"Took this shoe out of the box to Central and South America. Including Machu Picchu and a lot of hiking Including the Waynapicchu Trail. Performed well! No breaking in period. Encountered very wet weather with great results. Great grip on wet rocks! Only downside after a month of heavy use is I am starting to see some sole seperation especially on the sides off the outer sole. So far it's minor and performance not affected. Will be hiking some volcanic trails here at home in Hawaii and will be watching if seperation gets worse. Fit, comfort and weight is awesome!"
3,Good album.,"I changed my mind, I gave this album an unfavorable review yesterday. This morning I listened to it on headphones, the whole thing twice through and then some individual tracks. I shouldn't have forgotten how long it took me to even bear Trout Mask Replica and now it is one of my favorite albums... Decals has grown on my considerably at this point, who knows where I will stand on it in time. Definitely consider it."
3,Geller and the Occult,"Larry Geller introduced Elvis Presley into the massive literature of the occult, popularly known as New Age. While driving through the desert Presley was enlightened when a cloud in the shape of the face of Joseph Stalin changed itself into the face of Jesus. Elvis' strange rantings drove Priscilla into hysterics. A drugged Elvis went spiritually bananas. Recognizing the danger this literature posed to Elvis' sanity Colonel Parker had it removed. After they were married Priscilla persuaded Elvis to burn these books. A very strange story."
1,Ummm...No,"This product arrived and I was happy, LOVE Izze's, however, what I thought I was getting was four, 4-pks of 12-oz sparkling juice, not the one 4-pk. If that was the case, I could've went to my local store and picked-up the case for $5! This is definitely going back, talk about inflation :-|"
4,Mason lids,I love the plaid and use these for strawberry jams and such. They are cheery and easy to tell one canned goodfrom another.
1,Defective Item,Used this item and had to return because of the heating mechanism doesn't stay in place. Will not recommend to anyone. Absolute pain in the bu--. My husband and I were very disappointed with this product and can't believe they are allowed to sell this item due to it's engineering defect with the heating unit. Becareful if you do decide to buy.
1,All that meat and no potatoes...,"I can understand the fascination -- an attractive tenor with a voice that can both make you drowsy and startle you awake. But Mr. Mcdermott needs to search beyond the notes to find a sense of life in each song. His interpretations are anything but inspired. Seldom does he move beyond the score to any sense of discovery of what separates the characters to which each of these songs belong. Instead, we get a litany of vibrato which, no thanks to the orchestrations, feels like musac without any kind of distinction between songs. What the album needed was a producer worth their salary helping to coach this fine vocalist into new explorations of these mostly over-recorded songs."
5,"great bag, great price",This bag has enough storage area for all my art needs...the shoulder strap could be made stronger but works fine...Would definitely recommend this bag to my friends and family
5,Wolfgang Puck Cookbook,Wolfgang Puck is truly the master of cooking. In this book you find a carbohydrate lovers dreams come true...Wonderful pasta and pizza and more recipes.
2,Book or Magazine?,"I am in a class right now that this book was the recommended text for our class. We started looking through the book and found that this wasn't the best text book we could have for our class. Looking through the book I came to the conclusion that it was more of a composite of interviews in a magazine type structure. Bottom line this is not a good class book, but more of a ""I'm bored and feel like reading interesting facts."""
2,Product Designer,"This book was the worst text book that I ever brought for my class. There almost nothing that I can gain after reading through the book. Yes, there many good schools for designer around the states; however, if I want the find a good design school for myself, I will search these places on Google rather than buying a book cost 50 buck to find it.The other parts of the book give you tips and advices about how to become a great designer. Well, it might be helpful but I already got more than enough advices from my teacher and counselor. I cannot believe that this book is a requirement text book for my class. I rate this book 2 of 5, and do not buy it for your sake!"
1,GOOD coffee. BAD price.,Don't buy this coffee here!! You're paying more than the retail value!! K-cups should average out to be about 50 to 65 cents a cup MAX.
1,What's the deal with the price,"This review is based on price not on coffee quality or taste.Do the math.............2 boxes of 25 K-cups = 50 K-cups @ 41.95 = $0.839/cupOn Green mountain web site 24 K-Cups @ $13.95 = $0.581/cupYou can get that down to $11.95 for $0.498/cup with the ""cafe express"".Even if you buy from Keurig they are $13.95 for 24 K-cups.I love Amazon but that seems like a BIG price for the joy of buying from Amazon."
4,good,"Received the c.d. in Australia this moring. The c.d. is good but lacks a few of her very best songs, 1 in particular is LONELY GUITAR written by Jimmy Dodd. But overall I give it 4 stars and is very enjoyable (Brings back my youth)thanks"
3,Annette,"Obviously, the collection is far from complete but it does give a good sample of Annette's music. The Monkey's Uncle alone is worth puchasing this for"
4,Like to touch fluffy things?,"I've been a fan of the members of Seabound for years and picked up this little treasure back in 2005 after I heard Elegance for the first time via EBM club one night. Lux holds amazing beats, riffs, and lush synths by Frank M. Spinath. Lux is absolutely for anyone that craves old school synthpop and traditional EBM structured songs of yester-decades of 80's and early 90's. After Lux's 6 year debut,you still hear Elegance & Losing Ground played at the local clubs here in my area. From EBM newbs to EBM veterans like myself, you will find something to love about Lux.""I'm not asking you to give,I want you to take,Your grace and your voice,Weapons of choice,Mistress of innocence..."" -EoD-Xonic"
1,Junk,"This VCR ate the first tape I put in it. Circuit City expects for me to pay for the shipping charges to return it. They will only reimburse my shipping charges for the original shipping. I consider that bad service. When I am sent a defective product, it shouldn't cost me a dime to get it replaced!"
4,Uner the Sea is the place to be!,"Ariel,the youngest daughter sf King Triton,ruler of the sea,is fascinated by humans.Soon she falls in love with a prince.She sell her voice to a sea witch named Ursaula for a potion that will make her human for 3 days.In that time,Prince Eric must kiss her.Will she be human forever as she dreams?I love this movie because it has a good plot,GREAT music and lots of fun!If you like Disney,Romance or suspense,wrap your tentacles around a copy today!"
4,good..,"I'm 15 and my friends and I still love watching this!!! The songs are really good, lol.. so if ur thinking about watching this movie and don't really wanna ponder about the movie...watch it!!"
5,Part of Your World,"This Disney Classic is classic for a reason. The songs are the best, the characters are loveable, and Prince Eric is actually hot.I rewatched it at 21 for the first time in about 15 years and I still sung along to ""Part of Your World"", felt her anguish in ""Part of Your World Reprise"" and cried at the end. Now that's good entertainment"
1,Not the quality advertised,"Although the DVD case was sealed in plastic as if new, the disk was badly scratched and errored out immediately as soon as the player tried to read it. After as much clean up as possible it still failed, but at the insistance of a broken hearted 3-year old we kept trying. After 15 to 20 tries I was able to get it to play, but it still fails occasionaly. Certainly not ""very good"" quality. Which of 2 possibilities do you like? 1. Seller never really looked at it, just called it very good and shipped; or 2. Seller knew it was bad and shipped anyway."
5,A long waited DVD... at last in my hands!,"I've waited for this animation to be released on dvd ever since I heard of possibility of dvd invention years ago. I've loved it that much. I finally got this dvd and it's like a dream come true. I too was a bit disappointed by its lack of 'side dishes(special features)', which never stops me loving this film. What a lovely story! How wonderful the music is! This dvd is a must have.P.S. A video pause in chapter 17 is not a glitch. It is the very moment for switching to the other layer."
3,Disappointing DVD Transfer,"save your $ on ebay auctions and wait for the platinum series release. this version's sound is excellent (dolby 5.1), but the bland/dull colors is a big disappointment. poor visibility, below average clarity and very dark throughout the entire movie. i've seen better second generation VHS recordings. this being a classic Disney release, it deserves a new high definition transfer like Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King (outstanding DVD's)."
3,Great movie for kids though it can scare very little ones.,"When reviewing a kids movie I ask myself did I like it enough to watch again. The answer is yes. Did the kids watch it repeatedly. Yes. But of the five, the youngest (6 yrs old) just watched for the first time this year.It is a nice sweet movie except that the Bad Squid is a little to mean and scared my girls when they were real little.Ultimately the music is only OK and my children now sledom watch it, they have moved on and prefer to watch other films instead. This is a good kids movie and I recommend it."
4,As good as the original but with extra info.,"Great DVD to own. The only complaint is that it says it has games but it doesn't, just an interactive ride which my seven year old said was ""pretty boring"". So great DVD, but with all the hype;expected more."
5,Under the sea,"I have two grandchildren ages 6 & 3 and have been trying to build up a collection of children's movies that can be handed down and watched. This is one that I have not saw, but my step-daughter got it as a 16 year old and enjoyed it very much."
3,DVD worked ok until the end,"It played ok through most of the movie, but continually froze up near the end. I tried wiping the disc as suggested, but no improvement. I know they have a return policy, but I am too busy for a $15 purchase. I should have bought the new DVD."
1,dont buy,"received first copy...didnt play correctly....returned it and received another same problem, only worse. plays slowly and stops at certain points during movie"
5,Very Happy!,The expected delivery date for this product was 10/18-11/02 and I got it on 10/17. Very fast delivery. This was my favorite movie as a child and for the first time I watched it with my daughter and she loved it also. Product was in great condition and works wonderful. Very happy with this purchase and I would deff. buy from this seller again. Thank you!!!
2,Sketchy,"I am pretty sure this is not an original case of the movie and there is a glitch in the film at the same scene every time. For one, it's a two disc dvd but the inside of the case is unlike any other Disney 2-disc dvd case I have ever seen. My mom has this same dvd and her case is totally different. It came sealed but I think the person who sold it must have done it themselves because the Disney Magic Code for rewards points on the inside cover had already been used. Pretty sketchy if you ask me. Definitely won't buy from an outside seller next time..gonna stick to Amazon seller even though it's more expensive!"
1,never received!,Love the movie but I have yet to receive the product! Hoping to get it in time for Christmas but ordered it over 3 weeks ago so I am no longer hopeful! :(
4,My favorite Disney animated movie,"The Little Mermaid is my favorite Disney animated movie ever. Nothing beats the final scene of Ariel in her sparkly dress or the sound of her voice in the conch shell. Unfortunately, it does have some few minor flaws. The biggest of all, for me, are the steps. The hideous, hideous steps. There is a scene where Ariel rushes down some palace steps. The only problem is that the steps aren't animated- they're CGI. In an animated movie. They stick out like a sore thumb, and every time I see them I wince. I know it probably saved Disney a lot of $$$ while they were making the film, but I would've loved it if they had been reanimated for the remastered edition. Also, ""Under the Sea"" stretches a little too long for my taste and... well, that's about it. You really can't find t00 much at fault with such a classic."
5,I LOVE ARIEL!,"the little mermaid is a great movie.LOVE THE MUSICLOVE THE STORYLOVE THE MOVIEIts a really good movie, if you haven't seen it, then Hurry up and go watch it! Your life wouldn't be complete without it"
2,dvd review,"I bought it as a new dvd, but it was used. Both dvd's were scratched. We can barely watch it."
5,Another Disney favorite!,"This is another one of Disney's best films! It just cannot be matched - Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea tried and failed - horribly! Disney did a wonderful job adapting this fairytale as well, the original Hans Christian Anderson story was a bit gruesome and... it had a terrible, NOT happily-ever-after ending! This story brings you excitement, fun, and touching scenes that are unforgettable (considering that this was made in the 1980's and I have seen this movie soooooo many times!). This movie is guaranteed satisfactory for all ages (yes, we teens like these ""juvenile"" films too!). Just listen to the beautiful songs, look at the nice animation, and LIVE the magic! (As corny as that sounds, there's no other way to describe the effect The Little Mermaid will have on you! Watch it today!)"
4,First Princess Movie,My daughter will be 3 next February and this was her first taste of Disney Princess movies. She instantly fell in love and asks to watch it every week. We haven't given in but it is clear she is really paying attention to a lot more details than just the pretty colors and schemes. She is actually reciting the story to me and laughs at appropriate jokes. I love seeing the joy in her face. The movie is great and not too many scary scenes for the little ones as some of the other Disney movies. This one is a winner!
2,Kinda Sucks But Kinda Doesn't,"Sure, I'll admit the animation is quite nice, so is the music. But what gets me upset is this movie's story. The Little Mermaid was originally a fairy tale penned by a Danish writer named Hans Christian Anderson, who wrote other fairy tales such as The Ugly Duckling, The Little Match Girl, The Red Shoes, and The Girl Who Troad On A Loaf. In the real little mermaid, Ariel dies. For she does not win the prince's heart and he marries another chick. But in this one, of course a beautiful female creature falls in love with a beautiful male creature, and of course marry at the end. God, this film should have made by someone else other than disney because if they stuck to the original story it would have at least been rated PG-13. Thanks"
5,LOVE IT!,I've seen this movie 100 times at least. BLU RAY COMES OUT IN THE FALL OF 2013!!!!! YAY!!!!!!! FLOUNDER IS SO CUTE!!!!!!
2,The Little Mermaid,"The movie is great, but the scratches on the disc were unacceptable in my opinion. At least it seems to play ok so far!"
3,3 day old fish,"I loved this movie as a child and hoped to pass the enjoyment on to a family member, however the copy of the movie i was sent was unusable. My refund went through in a timely manner, however I'd have been happier with an undamaged movie."
3,DVD doesn't load properly,"The DVD doesn't consistently start at Scene 1. To watch it on Christmas morning, I had to reverse from Scene 2."
5,Vhs tape purchase,"Very happy with this purchase. Only thing was it took longer to arrive than i expected, came 3 days later. Price was great"
2,Knock-Off,"I bought this DVD as a Christmas present for my niece.I was highly dissapointed with it once it arrived.First off, this was NOT an official Little MermaidDisney DVD. The cover was a reproduced (copied)version of the true DVD. I know, because my daughterhas an original copy. It was wrapped in clear cellaphanebut did not have a sticker or label like you would find onan official copy. I haven't opened it to see what the actualDVD looks like, as I am still planning on giving it as agift, with an apology for the ""knock-off"" look! But I'm sureonce we do, I will be dissapointed with it, as well!"
1,ummmmmm,"this movie does not play all the way through....it is a knock off, i believe it stops almost at the end, I played it on two different players and the same thing happened"
5,Why isn't this Platinum Edition?,"The Little Mermaid is one of my favorite movies of all time. I remember being six years old and wanting to be Ariel. I was Little Mermaid crazy. I had everything. So of course I'm going to buy this DVD. But I wonder why Disney didn't make this a Platinum Edition DVD set? From what I understood movies that smashed box office records get Platinum Edition while other Disney movies that did good, but not great get Special Edition status. I just think that the Little Mermaid should have gotten the honor of getting Platinum DVD status."
1,Not what I expected.,"We recieved the DVD in a very timely matter, but when we actually opened the DVD, we knew immediately that there was something wrong with it. The picture on the front of the DVD looked like it had been printed on a printer that was running out of ink and was very smudged. We tried to get the movie to play on 3 different dvd players and could never get it to work. The bonus disc worked fine, but not the actual movie disc. I dont know much about bootleg movies, but if I was too guess, I would say this was one. I would like to say though, that we did recieve an immediate response, when we emailed about the problem, and I had a credit on my credit card by the next day."
2,Superficial compilation of secondary sources,"This book provides a very superficial overview of vegan nutritional issues. It cites heavily to dated secondary sources (nutrition books, encyclopedias, and journal articles, such as John McDougall's ""The McDougall Program"" (1990), Neal Barnard's ""Food for Life"" (1993), and articles in journals from the 1970s and 80s). There are few, if any, citations to primary sources or studies to support the text. If you're new to veganism and looking for an introduction to vegan issues, you may want to read this. If you want anything more in-depth or scholarly, look elsewhere."
3,Good info poorly presented,"I think the problem I had with this book is that I read it immediately after having read Joel Fuhrman's Eat to live. Dr Fuhrman presented the same information (and more) in a much more engaging manner. Not to mention that Fuhrman is a practicing physician who actually ""prescribes"" a vegan diet to hundreds of patients/year and monitors the results. I was inspired by Fuhrman's book. This one? Not so much."
2,Should be called The Practice of Programming in C,"This book is way too C-centric for me (I do Perl pretty much exclusively). A lot of discussion of topics like memory management and such that is not terribly interesting for many programmers. In addition, most of the material seemed like the kind of thing a decent programmer will pick up on the job after a year or two if they are any good.That said, this would probably make a great text for students in school who don't have much experience dealing with large, evolving projects, no matter what their preferred language is."
3,Good Introduction,"This book isn't bad. If you have any formal academic education in the area, you will probably want to just skip the first 2 1/2 chapters: they will have nothing new for you.The later parts of the book cover enough topics that there will probably be some things to pick up from it here and there. This book will definitely not make your brain sweat; easy reading for a weekend you don't have anything better to do.On the flip side, it isn't really going to give you any immediately useful skills."
1,Unbelievable,"This book tarts well, but you quickly realize that to enjoy it, you will have to suspend all reality. Since suspending reality becomes increasingly difficult due to the inconsistencies in the story line and action of the characters, it is doubtful anyone could enjoy the book. For someone who is supposed to be smart, the heroine goes from mistake to mistake. When she checks a safe deposit box, the bank says it hasn't been accessed since opened 22 yrs ago, but when she opens the box and finds money, she immediately thinks it is a bribe for which a person was convicted 9 yrs before. Bottom line--don't waste your money."
1,Terrible Crock Pot,"I asked for this crock pot for Christmas because the features sounded so wonderful and it had a nice size and a great look. I am very disappointed with this product. Everything I have tried to cook has burned and I am using tried and true recipes that I cooked in my old crock pot and worked fine before. It doesn't matter which setting I use, it ends up burning my food. If you do notice that your food is cooking too quickly, if you happen to be home and see it happening, you can't even turn it to warm manually, it can only be done automatically when the cooking time is complete. You have no choice but to turn it off and then the food will not stay warm. This is way more trouble than it's worth. I'm going back to old fashioned kind with a turn knob. Sad thing is I threw the box away to this item and now can't even return it!"
1,Simply AWFUL!,"This crock pot was a replacement for my old crock pot which was too small. I wish that I had not gotten any replacement now, as this crock pot works terribly. It does not slow cook. I have so far burned many suppers in it trying to get it to work correctly. The reviewers who say that your food is done in about 5 hours on the Low 10 hour setting are absolutely right! I do not have any idea why this crock pot is so awful, but I am now going to think about switching brands when I get a new one."
2,could have been great,"I bought this appliance thinking it would make my life as a busy mom easier. I was wrong. It burnt the first two recipes I made since it cooks too hot. I had to babysit my third dish and yes, it was finished cooking 2 hours before it was supposed to be done. It also sputters liquid all over my counter because the lid doesn't seal well. There needs to be an adjustable setting to change the hours because it will never kick over to warm before the meal is incinerated. I'm taking this back and getting a different model/brand."
2,ponderous,"i didn't know this was a reissue - maybe that ""80's"" feel is what's putting me off. or maybe it was that it had clunky lines, was overly melodramatic and too long. i read it on the beach and when i finished, i wondered who thought it'd be a good thing to bring back. i've read much better."
5,One of her best!,"This is the first Nora Roberts book I read, and it was what prompted me to read more. This book is fabulous. It is a book that kept me up all night because I just could not put it down. Genuine Lies is a tale of intrigue that continually makes you wonder, ""Who done it?"" Nora Roberts throws in a couple of twists that are not expected. I have read many Nora Roberts books since this one, but none of them compares. It's a cliche, but this is a MUST READ!"
3,A Hollywood Nora Roberts Novel,"This novel has a pretty good story, a surprise ending, but it's very redundant in some places. The ending was a surprise but not enough was said during the ending to tie up every loose end. It was ok but not a great read. Good for the beach."
1,SO DISAPPOINTED-----it doesn't even get a star,This CD was a big let down. It really sounds like your typical merengue CD. Nothing set it apart. I'm just glad I bought it dirt cheap.....
2,The Best Little Bead Book,"I was, frankly, disappointed. Too much space was dedicated to the author's mother and too little to beading."
1,Burned out fast.,"Within a few weeks of installation one of the 3 LEDs has burned out completely, and a second one strobes annoyingly, and I assume that it will give up the ghost soon. After the expense, and the trouble it took to mount this product, I can only warn you away from purchasing it. There are undoubtedly better choices out there.Update. Four days later. The last of the LED's has burned out. Bulbs are not replaceable. What a sorry-a** product."
2,Great Idea but very weak light!,"I purchased this item for a section of my yard where I do not have electricity and needed some light at night therefore the solar option was ideal resolution instead of hiring an electrician to run electrical to this area. This product was very easy to install (less than 5 minutes) but the light is very weak. It puts out a glow that is probably about 60 - 70% less intense than a conventional electric motion sensor light that uses standard bulbs. Does it provide light? Yes, for about 20 ft. max. After 20 ft then the light gets too weak to do much good and it is a blueish glow instead of a bright white. It barely fills the need I have to light a specific area that is not large but it pails in comparison to those who are used to the standard electric bulp type set up."
2,Light burn out too quick,4 of the 5 leds no longer work after only a month and the one that does work blinks constantly
2,My Next Goodwill Donation,"I use crock pots a lot and was looking to replace another brand that burned foods on low. This was slightly better. It only burns on one side. The low temp setting often brings foods to a boil. I also have a real problem with the programable settings. There is no way to advance the setting to keep warm. I cook a lot at home and then transport the crock pot to another location. Once the unit is unplugged, the only heating option is high or low. I'm going to send this with my next Goodwill donation and look for another product."
1,Bad Experience,"I must have gotten a lemon. The first time we plugged it in, the programmable display started smoking and gave off a burning electrical smell. Never even had a chance to see if it is a good crock pot or not. Taking it back and will try another manufacturer."
3,Salvatore is better than this,"Enjoyed this book less than the first episode. Writer makes Anakin's character too whinny and childish which is the point, but too much and in the movie it is much worse. Besides this, the story line and action is great."
5,Brahms Motets,Excellent production of the Motets. Brahms likes the lower women's voices and this production does not hide their central position in Brahms' treble pieces.
2,Really nice looking however........,"I love the way this rice cooker looks however when making brown rice the water tends to overflow and spill on the counter. After the rice is cooked, the cooker is covered with sticky water. Would not purchase again for this reason."
3,All those bottom drawer novels,"I may be way off the mark here, but what appears to be the case is that many of the first drafts that Hall put into his bottom drawer have been brought out and published without getting the full attention they need. This is true of several of the Hall books, and particularly those in the Thorn series, recently. There is still a lot of Hall's superb command of emotional gears, his eye for detail, his ability to shock, but the overall context - plot, characterization, conclusion - is careless. First draft, in fact."
3,Embezzlement a good idea?,"Carib does a little embezzling to help his village survive the reign of a greedy king. The book goes for a rather simplistic answer for what to do when a monarch or government is taxing the citizens to death. For a better and more rounded version, read any of the many versions of the Robin Hood myth."
3,"Soft feel, but pants ripped","My step-son also has a pair of these. The back end ripped out of his as well. He really liked them because they were soft, had a good feel and fit and were cool in hot weather. We'll give it another shot with a new pair, but hopefully this pair won't rip as well."
1,Not recommended,"I purchased two gates to block off both the kitchen doorways. My 14 month old son figured out quite quickly that all he has to do is keep rocking the gate back and forth and that it will knock over. I am constantly trying to get it as secure as possible. The memory feature does not work. My advice, spend the extra money on a gate that actually works efficient!"
3,"Not Great, But Serves it's Purpose.","Bought this gate to help keep my puppy in the bathroom. He's now a 4 month old, 30 pound english bulldog who absolutely hates being alone. Whenever he gets put behind the gate, he tries his best to knock it over. The gate holds sturdy and even though it has received considerable abuse it holds up just fine.However, it's not the easiest gate to use and adjust. But for $15 bucks, you can't go wrong. Especially when Petsmart is selling a similar gate for $40.Overall a good purchase. Would recommend."
2,Wish I Could Like It,"We really wanted the simplicity of a pop-in, pop-out gate. Since we have no stairs, a 100 percent impenetrable barrier was not needed, so this seemed to fit the bill. But there are just too many problems. First, and foremost, we find it cannot handle a single doorway in out apartment. In some cases there is a runner along the wall at the base...no go. In another, the walls on the two sides are not perfectly parallel, and the thing twists and torques and will not stay put. And once you install with a little too much force, it will never go straight again. Also, when it is not installed, we can never figure where to put it. The baby is always finding it leaning against a wall somewhere, and dragging it down. A pain.In contrast to some reviews, I do find that the ""memory-lock"" works ok. Just don't expect the directions to explain it to you.Did I mention how ugly the thing is?"
4,Easy & Inexpensive - not for molding,"I wanted an inexpensive and no frills gate since we needed a few of them. It's definitely sturdy - just a little bit of a pain for stepping over or removing and repositioning every time. I would not recommend it for people with baseboard molding, since it then needs to be placed above the molding and leaves a gap (not to mention, 7 inches to our high jump). Also - the shipping costs as much as the product."
3,it is ok,well it has a great price and it looks sturdy but it doesn't hang well to the wall my 9 month old just push through it and he is free to go anywhere. It doesn't lock well into its place. I am still using it but if you can find something for the same price that locks better that would be great.
1,"Nice price, but not worth it.","This gate didn't work for us at all. I could barely move it, to make it slide in either direction. I ended up returning it because it was useless."
4,Easy to use / hard to adjust,For the price I was actually not expecting anything good. We were just hoping for it to be good enough to stop the baby from climbing up the stairs. I was positively surprised at how good it actually works. It surely is not pretty but it does what it's supposed to do for a low price.The only thing difficult is getting it set up for the first time. I had to use one foot to keep it pushed against the wall while pulling with both hands to spread it between the walls in the stairwell. Definitely nothing you could do with a baby in your arms.But once it's set up it is easy to operate with only one hand. The memory funktion keeps it in the same position and the gate doesn't have to be readjusted each time.I also love how good it stays in place. No matter how hard my son is pulling and pushing on it - IT DOESN'T MOVE AT ALL. Definitely safe and easy to use at a top price. Just not very pretty to look at but what does that matter?!
4,North States Supergate..is a super gate,"This product was received promptly and packed well..I love this gate, no brainer to use and won't hurt my walls or doorways. I am using this gate on little Yorkshire Terriers, they don't need much to hold them back. I would not recommend this gate for any larger dog then a small terrier type..and for children, well, I believe you would need a stronger one as there are some pinching areas to the slide."
1,Crap,"I am installing a new floor and taking out tile and carpet, I also have a 2 year old and a 10 month old. I needed something that would keep my kids from the debris and i was hoping this gate would work for their bedroom. It did not. This gate did not EVER hold in place, it fell with my daughter as she leaned on it. If I barely touch it the gate falls. The top part of the gate has some tension and the bottom has none. POS. The only reason I haven't returned it is my son took the box and destroyed it. I wish I would have spent more money on an item that would actually work."
1,Crap,This product will not latch properly. You get what you pay for on this one. The plastic is cheap and was broken and chopped when it arrived. The way it latches might be the worst system I have ever seen. It wont stay latched and a 2 week old puppy easily will push it down.I would not trust this with a small child. Complete POS. DO NOT BUY!!
1,Flimsy materials make an inferior product,"I bought this to block our dog from an area. Amazon included it in the pet supply category. The dog jumped on the gate and bit out a chunk of plastic, cracking the gate on the side. Definitely not worth the price!"
3,wow small,well first off small... my one year old is taller then this gate. we bought to and our still using it on top of our old one. so in short get a messuring tape out before u buy. this is very sturdy but tight as 1st takes about a week to loosen then monovering is a brease.
1,"Cheap, Not Safe","Upon installation the gate lock pushes out causing it to bow out making it very difficult to step over, (after a week or so it was bowed out over 6 inches). Upon taking it out it ripped the paint off of my wall down to the drywall..."
4,"Very functional, low cost gate","The gate's not the prettiest thing. But that's obvious prior to purchase. As for functionality, it works. We have them in two doorways to keep our granddaughter from sneaking into un-childproof rooms. Sliding the width adjustment is a little clunky at first. Once the adjustment is made, opening and closing the gate is simple. We (adults) typically just step over it. The height is just right to keep a one year old in. Our five year old is the only one who can't just step over the gate. But he climbs well and the gate holds up great to him standing on the tension bar to climb over. It can also support his weight (45 lbs) without falling or bending."
2,ALRIGHT PRODUCT,this gate works I guess if you have straight walls. it really doesnt stay still and tight. I am sure there are much better ones out there but for 13.00 dollars i guess you get what you pay for
2,Pain in the butt!,If you're anything like me and don't have a lot of time to set up or take down a child gate then don't buy this one.
5,For the price not sure you can beat it.,"At $14 not sure you can do better. I really like the metal gates that open and close by foot, but again $14 vs $60-$80... I will do a little more work. No assembly or batteries needed and works great right out of the box. If you are looking for the best economical solution - Can't beat it."
5,Good item!!,Have been using this item for several months and have no complaints. Actually has lasted a lot longer than I expected. I recommend it.
2,Nothing to grab my attention,"I have tried listening to this CD three time now, but it still doesn't grasp my attention. It fades into the background...."
5,Excellent,This product was delivered in the time frame that I asked for. There are no rips or tears. Excellent
3,Nothing new,"Sorry, but i was disappointed. this book is just a cut-and-paste from all these firm's websites and recruiting brochures. There's nothing new here. I though other guides like the VaultReports guide on Consulting was a much better insider's look at the top consulting firms."
1,Computer Memory,"After receiving my order that was supposed to work in my laptop, it did not work. No matter what I did, it was useless to me. The service was good and the timing was excellent but the product was not a working product for me."
3,Worked but on another computer,"I bought this for a older Apple iBook G4. Turns out it didn't fit, but it did fit in my wife's Dell Inspiron 1545. So if you own a Dell and looking to upgrade your RAM I'd get this one, cheap and works."
5,Memory Upgrade,This memory was not specifically rated for a Dell laptop but was much cheaper than the one that was. It works fine in the Dell.
5,Good memory module,Works fine with my DELL notebook. I bought it for my Samsung but was not compatible. Please make sure that you run the Memory model selection tool from a memory manufacturers' web page.The price is so damn good. but the shipping got delayed.
4,Installed in a snap,"I went from 1/2 gig to 2 gigs and the install was painless and the increase in performance, especially when running multiple programs was instant."
5,"Easy to install, and improved handling","I put these on my 04 sport trac. I would reccomend theses shocks over the OEM. The tires stay where they belong. On the pavement. They have improved my cornering capabilities and limited body sway. Instalation was under and hour with no air tools. The ride is stiffer which my wife and I believe is an improvement from the soft OEM shocks. The shocks were also heavier and seemed better built the the OEM shocks, but I can't comment on reliability at this time. I've only had these on the Truck about 3 weeks and haven't put them through heavy rain or Chicago winters."
2,Really really bad mix.,"I owned the VHS of this concert which looked and sounded great. The transfer to DVD was really disappointing. The sound fades in and out and the female back up singer (can't remember her name) almost seems to have been intentionally subdued in the mix. The video is terrible as well, everything appears muted and out of focus. This was an amazing performance, I just wish I still had a VHS player to enjoy it with. I probably will not watch this train wreck of a DVD again."
5,Peter Gabriel - Secret World Live,Everything was as promised. Delivery was on time and the item was in great condition.
3,The BEST Concert DVD Disappointment Ever!!!,"Let me not waste too much of your time: Frankly, this is, hands down, the most amazing concert I have seen! This DVD offers a glimpse of why Peter Gabriel has a superb reputation as a live performer. The sound quality is spectacular! Unfortunately, I am SURE that Peter Gabriel had next to nothing to do with the planning for this Laser Disc converstion to DVD format. The picture quality is mediocre at best, due to the grainey picture quality. Peter Gabriel is one of the greatest showmen ever, and I am sure when you see this DVD that you will be in full agreement with me when I say that Peter Gabriel was violated by his video production company. An improved picture quality could make this the best concert DVD in publication. Still, this is a nice DVD to own if you've missed Peter Gabriel's shows. Just don't expect much from this DVD as an example of year 2003's DVD picture quality capabilities.....Sorry!"
5,"Great concert experience for eyes, ears, and mind","I saw the Secret World tour in San Francisco, LA, San Diego, and Sacramento. This was the high point of Peter Gabriels concert tours, far surpassing Shock the Monkey and Growing Up. The visuals on the DVD are somewhat grainy, some of the content has been overdubbed, but the choreography by Robert Le Page are well captured here. Sound quality is outstanding, and if you have a surround system, you will love the drumming of Manu Katche. Highly recommended."
2,Secret World Live: So So,"I like Peter Gabriel's voice and some of his songs, but I'd say that perhaps it's better to listen to his music than watching his DVD. Parts of it are too weird. I did not like the quality of the image either. The female singer is another minus. (He should take tips from Yanni and Phil Collins at the time of selecting his supporting singers)."
3,disappointed,"I was quite disappointed from the video quality. Actually, it the worst I have seen on a DVD."
3,Ghost in the Machine? At Least for Me,"This was my favorite video concert for a very long time and was ecstatic to see that it was coming out on DVD. Well I played it through my DTS sound system and it sounded great, but my Wega Flat Screen (ran through RGB) did not like good, more like broken up mosaic pieces of video. I have over 50 DVD's and this is the first one that has ever broken down like this. Now I did take it to my friends house and played it on a 3 gun projector and it looked fine, what gives, I do not know? My Synopsis: it looks good on VHS, but on DVD only the sound is full proof and the video,,, well I do not know why is falls apart on my system as many others after looking at several reviews."
3,Bad set? Bull.,"I agree that this is a great concert, and a ""must have"" for anyone who enjoys collecting concerts, but the quality of the video is just plain terrible, period. And yes, I have a high-def 57"" television, so it's not because I'm viewing it on a small tv. Grainy doesn't begin to describe it. So when I watch it, I pretend that I'm there and viewing the show through a thick smoke :)"
5,The Ultimate Peter Gabriel concert DVD,"What a package--great song selection, performances, and film production. I had it on VHS and finally obtained the DVD. I recall when this tour came through LA around 1995 or so and wished i could have seen it live. A great combination of theater and music. Tony Levin on bass and the gorgeous, sexy Paula Cole on vocals are more reasons to obtain this gem. I have this and Growing Up Live, and Secret world Live is superior."
2,Find the VHS version!!,"The negative comments from other reviewers about the poor video and audio quality on this DVD are 100% correct. I was shocked to find that the sound is out of sync with the picture over the entire course of the DVD (well, I presume so--I finally got so disappointed with it about 2/3 through that I turned it off to come on Amazon and replace my old VHS version!). Also, the picture is extremely grainy.The remastering job is horrible and Peter's studio-recorded vocals lack the urgency and energy of the live vocals they have replaced.I am a huge fan of Peter Gabriel's work and I can strongly recommend Secret World Live--but not in this butchered format. You would be much better off finding a copy of the original VHS version. That recording is absolutely enthralling, whereas this DVD version comes off as lackluster, amateur, and poor quality."
1,HOGWASH,"This book is pure nonsense. I found it in our public library, a two-volume set from 1904. It consists of poorly-written hearsay masquerading as scholarship."
3,Prometheus Award Nominee?,"I just finished reading Harbingers by F. Paul Wilson, a finalist for the Prometheus Award for best pro-freedom science fiction novel for this year. (It didn't win.) This is book ten in the Repairman Jack series, which concern a man fighting against supernatural powers. Being nominated for a Prometheus Award, I thought that this was supposed to be a great libertarian book, but I just didn't see it. I didn't really see any libertarian elements to the book, and it just seemed like a phoned in book. This book didn't do it for me. Sorry. Perhaps if I had read the first nine books in the series I might have liked it better, or if I was just looking for a supernatural thriller, I would probably have rated it four stars."
4,Attack on Gia?,"Better than the last one. This has better action and follows the path set out by previous novels. We get introduced to a whole new clan of characters, the yeniceri and the oculi. Throw in the targeting of Gia and Vickie and you have a very good read."
5,A great start...,"I really did love this book. I picked it up when I was trying to find a wicca 101 book. I wasn't exactly sure what druidism was but I did have a very basic idea. The back of the book sold me. It is very basic and covers a lot. It's a very good beginners book and she covers more reading in case the reader would like to get more involved in the druidic path. It is for the modern-day woman as it teaches how you can keep these nature teaching even if you live in the city, in a tiny little apartment like I do."
3,Only buy if you have read the book,"I enjoyed reading the book and was a little disappointed in the movie. It's not a bad film to watch but, it could have been better. I wouldn't have bought it if I hadn't read the book. William Schallert , a good character actor through many decades, was to old for the part of Max Devore and didn't have the evil intensity of the book's Max. Everyone else was good especially the little girl who played Kyra."
1,Received a used and broken Palm Tungsten E2,"This is the 3rd Palm product I have owned. The first was a gift. The second was bought from Palm. Unfortunately I had to return this new Palm as it was obviously not NEW (big scratch on the case) and was not working, it wouldn't even turn on after being charged overnight. I subsequently bought the same item from my local Best Buy. I am very disappointed. This doesn't say much for your quality control."
5,Very Impressed with the Product,"The PDA was delivered w/i days of ordering and well before Christmas, great job.It looked brand new and it was easy to install and seems to be working find.I did have one question I emailed them and they responded w/i 12 hours.Would definitely order from them again."
5,ray,Renew Electronics did a great support job for me. My product works perfectly. They were very responsive with my technical questions.
4,A stable Handy PDA,"This is my second PDA to replace a Palm Zire 71, which I found to my dismay to have a very short battary life, and a non-replaceable battary.The E2 is great. The graphics are vivid, crisp and impressive. The programming is easier than with my Zire 71.It does more than I need, and was affordably priced.My only minor complaint is that the screen display seems slightly delayed when writing text onto the screen. The letters I write seen to have a slightly longer than I am used to before they appear on screen."
5,Product exactly what I wanted.,Seller was very helpful and provided extra information about the product. My Tungsten E2 arrived quickly and was exactly what I wanted. I would trade with this seller again.
1,Doesn't work!,"I've been a Palm fan since they existed, but this new one (my fourth) just doesn't work right. The Search function calls up the first eight entires, but when I click ""Find More"" it just recalls the same first 8, again and again. Often, I get a ""Fatal Reset"" when ""Searching""."
1,didn't work,"I hae the palm E and was told that all I had to do was load the palm E2 and it would work in about 10 minutes. Simple huh! It would load, it wouldn't sync and it wouoldn't leave my desk top alone. Kept changing the config. I sent it back and will keep my Tungsten E until the bugs get worked out. Amazon took it back without complaints for a full refund."
3,helpful but old,"Pro: If you like using a standalone organizer you will like this device.Con: Annoying cables, hardware needs updating, no update on the horizon.I bought this to replace a broken Z22, the entry level organizer. Amazingly it is stupider than a Z22 leading me to believe the Z22 was the last hardware to get an update before Palm lost interest in these devices.The E2 has 2 cables, one for updating, one for charging. Neither is standard. The Z22 had one cable, a standard mini usb. The E2 refuses to charge off the computer. It will only charge off the 120 V adapter. When powered off a press in the center of the Z22 will show you the time. A press on the Tungsten E2 shows nothing.In short, if you need the memory expansion slot or any of the extras go ahead and get this. If not, run, don't walk to the Z22.PS, if you're prone to breaking screens, there's a metal case for the E2. Often you have to do a search on Amazon ""tungsten E2 metal case"" to get it to show up."
1,Mine only lasted 7 months.,"I purchased this E2 from Amazon for slightly below its $200 list price. I didn't purchase its $50 one year extended warrenty feeling it was too expensive since it was only good for one exchange. It came with a 90 day warrenty for repair, exchange and telephone support. I was loving it until it just stopped working seven months after my purchase. I tried a hard boot, etc. but I couldn't get anything other then a lit up blank screen with a vertical stripe. This was my first AND LAST purchase of a Palm product. My HP PocketPC lasted 3 years until I accidentally broke it."
2,"Ok, features but BADDDD Support","My Palm Tungsten E2 will not accept my Expansion card. I called thier support and they said that it only supports up to 1 GIG. I had gone out and purchased a 2 Gig card. IT IS NOT ON THEIR SITE what the device support. It does not say under Expansion Slot only support 1 Gig. Their tech support guy lied or does not know what is on your site because he argued with me about what it supported. So Now I have purchased a card that I can not use.They do not provide any details about their product and how it works on their site, no manual comes with the device, they phone support is outsourced and VERY BAD, and their tech support does not know what is going on with the device. Buy this product at your own risk."
1,HORRIBLE warranty. Palm should be ashamed of themselves!!,How can something that cost $200 only have a 90 day warranty? You have to pay $25 for them to even see what is going on with it and then on top of that - more money to shell out past 90 days - anywhere from $100-200. I would NEVER buy this unit over the internet or get it without an extended warranty from a store. Palm is obviously not backing up this model or the warranty would be much longer.
4,To bad for the expansion limits,"This is the first PDA I've had. I have not been used to an agenda, not even a paper agenda, but this one is so simple and intuitive that I have been enjoying its use.I found out, however, that you can not use more that a 1GB SD Card which is very unfortunate. It seems that i will have to buy many SD Cards, for my music and videos."
4,Tungsten E2,There's a high-pitched buzzing sound when the unit is turned on. I've seen this in other E2's (the E's didn't have this issue) and talked to Palm who said it's normal. Otherwise the product's great. Fast shipping.
1,EXTREMELY UNHAPPY,"I purchases this item in November, it is now January and after 2 weeks at Palm repairs it still does not work!!I am soo upset, and I do not know who to complain to. Palm repair has all foreign speaking personal who can only read from a preprinted script and cannot understand ""please transfer me to someone who speaks english""I am out lots of money and no way to get a working pda!I have no idea why I am writing this, no one cares. I will not get a message from someone to offer assistance on how to get one that actually works.Oh well - happy new year I guess."
2,Tungsten E2 OK,"As much as what I love the Tungsten E2, and as much as it has helped keep my appointments and documents organized, this is unfortunately my second one. After a year of great use it lost its screen callibration which isn't a part of the regular 90 day warranty and neither is tech support. The only reason that I purchased a second one is because of the documents and programs that I use at work with the Tungsten E2. Palm has a horrible warranty policy. With the exception of the screen calibration, it is a great piece of technology to help keep you organized. Palm, get a consumer friendly warranty policy. This is my last palm!!!"
4,Still enjoy my Palm,"This will be my third Palm (have also had one HP). It is easy to navigate, provides clear screen, and is not too complicated. There was some difficulty in transferring my Outlook information from the computer to my new Palm & in downloading some extra programs.I had to purchase extra Palm software to download my EWallet."
1,Memory Loss Nightmare,"Imagine this: you go onto your palm desktop to find that the 1,000 contacts you have amassed over the past three years have disappeared. But...you still have your handheld with its memory. So you make sure that the hotsynch is set so the handheld overrides the desktop. You perform the hotsynch and guess what? (I know, you're way ahead of me) everything is erased - on both the desktop and the handheld. Then I go onto their website and I see lots of people with the same complaint - ""I lost all my data, is there any hope?"" Nope."
1,Synchronization features are atrocious - in some cases it simply does not work,"I am a network administrator for several small businesses, and have the misfortune of supporting several of these devices. Sometimes they work, but in some other cases a user's calendar will simply not synchronize with Outlook. A long, difficult trip up Palm's support tree eventually leads to their techs recommending you buy a third party synchronization product. So, only purchase this device if you either don't care about synchronization with Outlook, or you are willing to pay 50$ to buy a third-party synch package. The claim Palm makes that this device can synch with Outlook is false, and Palm is aware that it is false, and will refuse to provide you with any remedy when you contact them. Avoid if you value your time!"
4,"A good pda from palm. The E2 works well for me,as long as i dont need service.","This is my third palm pilot...I found it very easy to set up,and easy to use...My unit has been trouble free..My previous units had memory wipe problems..My cell phone rang,and my palm was blank...Customer service was lacking to say the least...I received this one as a gift...,so im happy for now...After reading the reviews,from my fellow reviewers,i can see the unit is good,if you are lucky...If you purchase the palm,please make sure they have a good return/refund/exchange policy,before purchasing...These units are very sensitive to static electricity...This may explain the data memory issues,that some people have experienced...I thank you stewart l 12/07/05."
4,Tungesten E2 Review of Product,"In my opinion, this product meets my expectations. I definately did NOT like the case that it came with and had the same feedback from other coworkers that felt the same way. When you purchase a product that is pricy, you automatically feel that it should come equipped with what the customer feel is user friendly. I know that I do not have a problem paying for what I want if the company provides the necessary accessories rather than making me purchase other items to have a good fit. This tends to make me try other vendors. In these times, technology changes are rapidly changing as well as prices for competition. So, if you would like to keep people coming back to you, then you should provide them with what they would be very happy with."
2,Everything changes except Palm Tugsten E2,"I just got a new Palm Tungsten E2 and am thoroughly disgusted with it already. I use Windows Vista 64b and I now come to understand that my Windows system doesn't allow me to synchronize with the E2. There was absolutely no mention of this in any of the literature I read before buying. Nothing in the owner's manual either. So now I'm stuck with a device that I cannot synchronize with the PC. (2)When I tried to install the E2 in my PC, the PC(by HP) cycled endlessly (several hours). There was no ph. # to be found in the materials that came with the device, I finally called HP to solve it. To top it off, my previous E2 (about 2 years old) died unexpectedly, no obvious reason why (it was synchronized with an older PC). Well, I guess I'm a sucker for staying with Palm for the replacement."
3,Nice palm for a while,"The E2 *was* my fourth pda. I bought my E2 after my clie died (worked ok for two years). After 8 months I awoke one morning and without any warning, the E2 digitizer was off calibration by about 5mm. I had to touch the screen *above* where I really wanted to touch. Calibration failed and could not correct the error. I did a hot sync and soft reset, but no luck. Finally did a hard reset and that solved the problem, but for only two weeks. I was about to do the Hot Sync / Hard Reset treatment, when I accidently rolled over onto it while it was in my pocket. Now I have a night-light. The backlite glows continuously and doesn't respond to any button."
5,"Good Buy, but not. . .","This is my second palm, the first being an m130(pos). This one is MUCH MUCH MUCH better. However, after owning it for only 36 days, it stopped working. I put something into my calendar on the bus to school at about 7 am, then tried turning it on again 3rd period for homework, and nothing. It had over 1/2 a charge just 3hrs earlier, and nothing worked. I plugged it it right when I got home, and still nothing, even using the usb charging and all different resets. (...)Appearantly, over 50 others have had the same problem and told palm about it. I've regretting this buy very much. Gonna try selling it on ebay or something and get a pocket pc. Get a Dell Axim or HP Ipaq instead, much better bang for the buck. I know ppl with them, and they're much better."
1,Don't buy an E2,"Once upon a time, there was a company that made great PDAs. I purchased a Palm Pilot m200 from them, and it was wonderful. Durable, great screen, solid controls, good battery life. It was stolen one day. I tried to replace it with a Tungsten E2. It turns out to have a cheap plastic case, a power button that eventually stops working, and a touch screen that wears out after a year and becomes impossible to calibrate or use. And the power supply only works with 115V and not 220V. It is really a shame that Palm stopped making good PDAs. I certainly do not recommend the Tungsten E2. Please take my review seriously. I should have listened to the reviews when I purchased my E2."
2,"Not bad overall, but a couple of issues kill the deal","Nice Palm product, but:- horrible reliability and warranty support; big probability of being stuck with non-working device.- humongous USA-only power adapter means you can't use your PALM when traveling abroad. Why mobile phone makers can include nice, tiny and worldwide power adapters?Took a loss and sold mine on E-bay."
4,Palm Tungsten E2 review,"My avocation is birding. On field trips, some of which last many hour and entail miles of walking with an array of optics, camera gear and assorted other accoutrements-field guides, portable CD player and 4-5 CDs. This stuff get heavy. The Tungsten has a memory card slot and National Geographic has developed an SD memory card with their field guide data on it and accompanying bird calls, songs, whistles etc. Not only does the device function as a calendar, notepad etc. it has allowed me to dispense with a book, the portable CD player and several Cds. A great saving of weight and space in the pack. I've never had the battery run down in the field, but I charge it up prior to the beginning of the trip and carry a car charger with me. The screen protector works well. External speakers need to be used for listening to the songs and whistles, but the Altec iM4 Portable Speakers are clear and have great volume. Very satisfied with the product."
2,disappointed,"Well I got this device 1 1/2 years ago. I was at first pretty impressed. It worked fine and I had nothing to complain. Then about 6 months ago, the software crashed (and I had no warranty any more). My husband was able to temporarily fix the problem, but it keeps recurring and we need to reset the whole PDA. Maybe I am just unlucky (cause his is fine), but this means that they have some devices out there causing all sorts of problems."
1,Flash in the pan,"Good product for 4 months before an early demise. The unit just stopped working. I called Palm for help, I was told to pay $25 for the first call and $145 to repair the unit. The unit can be bought for around the same price new on the net. What a sham!!! They lost a customer, if they care......"
1,Don't be fooled . . .,"After buying Star Office, I should have been wise and relized that you get what you pay for. First off, the Java problem, MS does not have Java in their operating system anymore. You have to try to find it or use the buggy mess on your pc. It causes problems on your computer, popping up with Java script errors.More delight, when converting files from MS Office they change??? What is going on with this, did the people who wrote this live on Mars or something..... More problems, the icons on the screen are un-readable they are so tiny and sometimes they do not display correctly. This was a mistake, I hope it the java un-installs with the rest of this Star Office to the recycle bin on my desktop.Next stop, buying MS Office something that works, and does not require a computer science degree to operate...I recommend MS Office, it actually works and is used by ALL home users and businesses!"
2,Some things missing,"Since this is the best choice you have after the MS offer Sun forget to consider more OS Upport (OS/2 which had support when Sun bougth Star Division) Lotus Smart Suite filters, macro compatibility (i don't want the viruses, but many ppl used to have lot of macros and depends on them for every day work). I would love to see those think fixed, specially the OS/2 support"
1,Requires Java to run,"This has to be the worst office suite I have ever used. It caused my computer to crash because of java. Since this episode, I have purchased MS Office and spent even more money.Do yourself a favor and just use software that works. MS Office 2003 is like a life saver!"
1,Worst Office suite I have ever used,"To say one thing positive was when I UN-installed this horrible Java exception bug software. Anyone who installs the Sun Java to work with Star Office has ruined their system.It has costed me over $100 at a pc repair center to reload Windows and I had to buy MS Office!ARRG, I am not happy!"
4,Well-written novel about an unusual relationship,"The book was beautifully written. It focused on Peggy, the main character, and her reactions and relationships to others. The other characters are not well-developed; they reflect Peggy's perspective. I think it successfully portrayed how someone who finds it difficult to get close to others eventually does, in an untraditional way. The ending was very disappointing, as if the author was unable to find a logical conclusion. A better ending, and I would have rated it five stars."
2,Hypothyroid Giantism Distances Reader,"Mousy Librarian Preys on 8'7 Freak might run the title. Why do I get this image of Ms. McCracken dutifully leafing through Nat'l Enquirer, dutifully sitting before her computer, dutifully writing not to bore herself? The best parts have Peggy Cort talking about being a librarian; those parts are dry-as-dust, too, but have a lived resonance, albeit a hypothyroid one. Peggy is bookishly self-absorbed, chattily comatose, knowingly obsessive. I do not care about chilly Peggy (and she is the only character). The book is oversmooth--it's too professional, the too predictable product of a writer's workshop approach to creation. Franz Kafka, Jilted by YA Lit, Seduces Media Specialists."
3,Did not live up to expectations,"After all its fine reviews, I was really looking forward to reading this quirky little tale of the librarian who falls in love with a teenage giant. The characters were all very real, but I was never given quite enough reason to care what happened to them. It was a nice little story, but it never really engaged me"
5,Classic Tale of Love and Romance in a Small Town!,"I have to say that author Elizabeth McCracken has written a classic novel about a small town between Peggy Cort, a single librarian, and a young man, James, who is literally a giant. The story takes place decades ago where a relationship between Peggy and James bond over a love of books. Their relationship evolves from a friendship into a romance. McCracken writes clearly and precisely. The writing is not too difficult to understand. It's written in the first person from Peggy's point of view. There are other characters like Mrs. Sweatt, James' mother, and other characters. It was nominated for a National Book Award in fiction when it first came out in 1997. The book has an Oprah appeal to it too."
3,just so so,"We used it while traveling yellowstone NP this September. It can stand on the bumpy rock with no problem, but cannot grab tightly."
4,short legs make wrapping moot,"The tripod is fine, but nothing to get excited about. The legs aren't long enough to wrap it around anything I've tried. I've owned it for 5 weeks. It is fun to work the legs to create the angle I want but the Mino I use it with is often not level. There is no adjustable screw base so you turn until it stops so the legs aren't always in the desired position. It's more fun that a 6"" regular tripod but it's not more functional."
4,Not bad,"It's a little unstable because the flipcam screws into it on the left rather than at the centre of the device, but it works pretty well if you spread the tripod's legs out and it's really really cheap."
3,While I like it..,"It's average. The tripod is probably no bigger than my hand. I like that the legs on it bend, but they don't curl (aka you can't actually make the tripod grasp an object)"
3,"It is what it is, which is SMALL","This tripod is as advertised. Arrived soon and was packaged well. It is however very small. No real use for it other than if you wanted to take a timed self-portrait placing your camera on it on a table then posing in front of it. I was hoping to be able to aim it at a sharp downward angle and place items directly under it for close up photos on a table, nowhere near enough adjustment to be able to do that. No complaints on purchase and shipment, product is what it is, it just isnt useful for much."
3,It's alright,"Basically an ok item, The legs are a little stuff when used with a light weight camera and need to be forced into position. I bought this with the intent of using on uneven surfaces when doing the tourist thing. The legs work much better or flat surfaces than rocks/status etc...For the price you can't complain much however."
1,Broke in the first two minutes of use.,"The thread is plastic. I guess I turned it too hard, because it snapped off the legs when I tried to tighten it. Okay, well, straight from China, by plane, truck, and mailman to my trashcan."
3,Not strong enough,In under stand that it isn't made for a slr camera but mine is very very light and it can't even hold that up so there was no point in waiting the month that it took to get here. But it's really good if you have a small pocket camera
5,Great Buy,"I laugh everytime I use this tripod and then I am awed by the pictures that actually come out. This thing is the greatest thing I could have bought for 5 bucks. The legs support a lot of weight and bend to any shape you want. The only time I've had trouble with it was when I had my heavier 55-200mm VR zoom lens on it, but I just moved the legs more towards the front to balance it out. GET IT!"
1,Cheap and flimsy,"The legs broke off the fifth time I used this tripod. The metal just sheared and broke. Even though I didn't pay much for it, it wasn't even worth that."
3,Nice to have along,"Good to carry around if you have a very light camera or centered tripod mount, horizontal shots only, but it does this job well."
2,a whole lot like the last one,"I'm a David Handler fan. Read the first two in this series. Loved the first and so-so about the second. This is the third, I think. It was too similar to the second. If an author is writing a series with consistent characters I think each plot needs to be clearly different than the last or they all run together. I think they call that ""Jessica Fletcher"" syndrome -- one plot is pretty much just like all the others."
4,My favorite perfume.,"I wore Alexandra for years, but upon purchasing this bottle I found it does not have the lasting scent that it used to. In the past even my laundry smelled amazing because it lingered. This is still a great scent, but I find myself using more, and having to reapply whereas I didn't have to before."
3,colors are great,My daughter likes them but they do not stick as well as ithought hey would. Fits like a sticker and so you myust be really precise. Bought two so i hope there is no residue left. She liked htem but was not in love with them.
3,Disappointing Blu-ray Package,"Don't get me wrong - the movie is great - one of my favorites. My rating is for the package only. However, I do not see much difference between the Blu-ray and the DVD I already own - except for some clarity. The content is the same except for the English language audio version, which I don't feel was done very well. Assuming it is a product of the times when it was done, maybe it's just the best they could do. However, I prefer the original German with English sub-titles. All in all, I regret having bought the blu-ray version which is basically, just over-priced."
5,A surprisingly modern 1931 film,"A man is killing children and using modern forensics techniques, the police are after him.That's the story of M...which regrettably tells a tale that remains all too familiar today.Featuring a haunting performance by a much younger Peter Lorre, this film follows the chase as the killings mount and the police draw closer to their suspect.Though the Fritz Lang who made this film lacked the same kind of resources he had when making his epic masterpiece Metropolis, the sparseness of special effects (including sound, then itself considerd a special effect) actually works in favor of the piece's realite and only serves to make it all the more chilling.If art is something that evokes a response in all who see it, then perhaps great art is art that continues to perform its artistic mission even generations after its creators are gone.M is therefore great art. And this reproduction is a must see, even over the last Criterion release of the same film."
5,Creapy!!!!!!,"This is one seriously disturbing movie. Fritz Lang created several masterpieces (e.g., Metropolis) in his career, but M is unique. This was Lang's first ""talkie"" and to be honest the dialog means little to your ears if you're watching M and can't understand German (you can read English subtitles - very well done in the recent criterion release on DVD). Yet the ""talkie"" nature of M is critical when Lorre's character whistle's chords from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt before each chilling moment. I found this use of a simple repeated musically element to be one of the most effective I have ever heard in a film. If you don't like subtitles M won't be your cup of tea, but if they don't bother you then check this movie out. You'll have chills for a while I promise! 5 stars!*This review is of the Criterion 1999 version."
5,A Masterpiece!!!,"Criterion has done it right again by presenting ""M"" the classic Fritz Lang masterpiece film in an outstanding 2 disc collection. This edition is worth owning in your film library. I enjoyed the bonuses especially the Fritz Lang interview along with the informative film commentary. This was Lang's first sound film. Let's not forget Peter Lorre's groundbreaking role as Beckert, the child killer. This edition is a must have!!!"
1,A poor early Fritz Lang work.,Reality check:Plays like a simplest TV show. Main character is NOT developed. A highly overrated movie not even having good cult elements.Plays like an early work for a person who has just gotten a camera in their hand and doesn't understand the need for playing out detailed subtle story elements. Instead it is like watching a show made for children.The worst American TV shows are this good.A classic 1 star.
1,Couldn't write to it!,"I had just gotten a Toshiba e310 Pocket PC and wanted to take advantage of the SD slot so I could load up some music files. Each time I tried it I got error messages saying the media was write protected. This card comes with a ""lock"" so you can protect your data but I tried it with the lock in both positions and nothing would work. I emailed SimpleTech and was informed that the card must be defective. Hence, the low rating. Maybe I was just unlucky but I'm going to try another brand. At least their customer support got back to me quickly. Too bad the product didn't work."
4,Great card - but only 122 MB of memory,"The card works great and had no problems using it. However, I did find that it only registers as 122 MB. I think the difference is that the card is not 128 MB, but rather 128,000,000 Bytes. Usually 1 MB is 1024 x 1024 Bytes. I think this should be clarified on the product description.Another thing - even though Amazon's description states that it is over 10 MB/sec, the 128 MB is really only 2.5 to 3 Mb/sec. I think their 256 MB and 512 MB cards are faster. Check the online manual for details.Other than that - no problem!"
1,Less a novel than a propaganda piece for Spiritualism,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle lost his son, brother, and two nephews in World War I, and this led him to believe in Spiritualism. This book is less a novel than a propaganda piece for Spiritualism; it uses characters from the Professor Challenger stories, primarily the journalist Edward Malone and Enid Challenger, with a few appearances by Professor Challenger himself, and lectures the reader on the characters' conversion to Spiritualism. There are a few passages reminiscent of Doyle before his reason was affected, and an interesting although shocking suggestion in chapter two that the deaths of ""ten million young men"" in World War I were punishment by the ""Central Intelligence"" for humanity's laughing at the alleged evidence for life after death. But the bulk of the book is unreadable."
4,Ethno-ambient a la didge...,"Lights in a Fat City was the brainchild of Eddie Sayer, who here plays percussion and something called a hybrid harp. This is their latest album of four (one is currently out of print), and, for my money, is the best. On this album, Sayer is joined by two musicians who have each released their own albums, and have also both played with the acknowledged master of ambient music, Steve Roach.The two are Kenneth Newby and Stephen Kent. Newby plays the Indonesian suling and piri, as well as bells, and also supplies electronics which are used sparingly. Kent, known for his prowess on the Australian didgeridoo, is much in evidence here on that instrument as well as on animal horns of various kinds.The compositions, all original, range from 3 1/2 minutes to almost 25 minutes in length and are all fascinating: highly recommended!"
5,"Excellent, fun read","A perfect synopsis of the proposal process, perfect for this beginner. It was a fun read, and I feel I understand the process of compiling and submitting a nonfiction book proposal clearly and completely now.Thank you Mr. Mettee."
2,Weak grounder to first,"Look, I enjoy Jerry Remy's ""company"" while watching Sox games. He's experienced, insightful and witty. I prefer him to all the other regional broadcasters, and much prefer Remy and Orsillo to the Fox national crew. But this book was a huge letdown. It was repetitive, topical, and lacked tempo. I didn't learn anything that I could use to become a better spectator. Given Remy's ease in front of the camera, I have to think his editor failed him, but I suppose that's neither here nor there."
3,Voice Mail Indicator doesn't work,"This phone comes with a voicemail indicator. I have voice mail through Verizon - a large phone company but this indicator is not compatible with their stuttering tone. Bummer. This phone does have a lot of neat features. You can expand the system to four phones and sync the address book. The sound quality seems fine to me. Also, you can put a call on hold and then transfer it to one of the other three extensions."
1,Its a commercial,"This VHS is nothing more than a commercial for Japan Airlines. Having lived in Japan, the depiction is pure fiction. Approximately half the time is spent on JAL or the national train system (which is probably a subsidiary of JAL). Adding insult to injury, what's not an ad for JAL is an ad for Travel Preview which shows this video can be purchased from them for $12.95.Not having seen any of the other Travel Preview videos, I can only suspect they are nothing but commercials and fictional accounts of the subject area."
5,Precious and Engaging,I bought this book for my six-year-old granddaughter. I was delighted with the quality of its construction and darling hands-on design. I have decided to start a pop-up book collection for her because this book is so engaging and memorable.
3,Just OK ...,"My 3yo son likes the bug books because they are silly. This is not one of Carter's best popups but my son likes the removable party hat (I don't consider it wearable) and the removable birthday candles for the birthday cake.Pros:1. 3yo son thinks it is fun. He chooses to look at it by himself sometimes.Cons:1. Easily torn or bent the wrong way. My son yanked the glued on candle out of the birthday cake immediately but is old enough not to tear it. Keep away from younger children.2. Not much educational value.3/5 stars because although it is silly entertainment for my son, there are other pop up books that are more creative, educational, and just as entertaining. See other titles by David Cart or search for Jack Tickle (a.k.a. Jane Chapman)."
4,Very well done,"How come I never heard of this guy? Virtually every song has merit. Excellent production, playing and singing. Great lyrics, great sense of humour, great entertainment. I will definitely give this multiple listens."
5,Correction,"Since my original review was edited to the point of inchoherance, I'll make it much more t the point: It rocks! Get it!"
2,"2 stars for effort, but the album sucked.","This is an example of an album that shouldn't have ever been made. Completely lacking the melody and jam of earlier efforts this is the sound of an uncreative burned out dry spell made only to continue producing albums. It's a ripoff, to put it simply. No catchy songs, lame lyrics, dry overall feel. No magic. No gusto. No coolness. No buy this album!!2 stars for effort but the album sucks!!"
3,Good Stuff.,"Now before all you Overkill fans start voting ""no"" let me say, I'm an Overkill fan to! Its just that this album isn't all its cracked up to be. It's got some of their best songs, but also some of their worst. Thunderhead absolutely rips. It has a thrusting, masterful rhythm and a catchy as hell chorus. What a great start the following tracks are good, though not great. The track of the album award goes to ""Let it Burn"" which a masterful thrash headbanger. I listen to it and my head starts banging as if on it's owwn. Many of the songs seem SO close to being as good as Thunderhead and Let it Burn, but are missing something (an example is Blown Away), while My Name is Pain is absolutely horrible and was most likely tossed on as filler. Not bad, but not Overkill's best either (though they are not on a slide or anything, as My December , a recent song, is my fave Overkill song ever). Good, but not the best."
1,"Tedious, torturous, and terminally tepid","Ugh! Finishing this book, I felt like Sisyphus eternally rolling the (book) stone up his hill - the task never ended. Random words on a page would have been marginally more entertaining and could have possibly held more meaning.There is one character in this book. The rest are just names (with an occasional, conservative dash of personality). This single character is completely unlikable, uninteresting, and ultimately incomprehensible, as he is split into multiple ""personalities"".The story covers a couple hundred years taking 20-40 years at a leap between every other short chapter. This gives the story a rushed feel or makes the reader feels like he's reading a history without much detail (or an outline).Strahd makes an appearance and is equally uninteresting and has no personality. The ending is confused and sad..."
3,Nice book,"I love this book a lot and the first time I have been able to find a book that details origins and history of ragas in a concise manner. This is not a book to learn ragas from but rather it provides a basic introduction into the ragas. Notation is provided for all the audio examples, although they are hard to sight read. One thing that annoyed me a lot is that there is no audio/instrument examples for the melodic movement. It would have been great if the artists plaid the melodic movement of the raga notated before playing the raga."
2,Dangerous purchase,"The Ragas themselves are great. 5 stars, in my opinion. So is Amazon's speedy delivery. I managed to get mine within three days, and had selected the 3-5 business day shipping plan.However, the packaging sucks. I thought I was getting a box set. It ain't no damn box. The four CDs come tucked into plastic sleeves attached to the inside covers of the books.At least two of my CDs were RUINED in removing them from their packaging for the FIRST TIME! And know, I'm not some idiot who can't take a CD out of its case. There was no case. They were practically stuck to the plastic they came in. I had to use force to remove them; not much force, but enough that they scratched against the plastic when coming out of the sleeves. And the worst part is, I can't return them, or get a refund, or a replacement."
5,Easy to use and rugged,"This multimeter is easy to use and has more functionality than I know how to use. One of my favorite features is the temperature probe, which I've used in our data center to find hot spots and servers.The soft-plastic case is removable and provides good drop protection and isn't slippery. The tip-out stand is helpful when using it on a desk."
4,under rated classic,I love this movie. It is a smart disney movie about two mice who solve a mystery I really enjoyed it and I still do everytime I see it. Bravo! A true disney classic
4,Great movie,I definitely didn't remember this movie being as dark and depressing but still a great cartoon for the collection.
5,Sad but cute!,"This movie made me cry during different scenes like the scene in the orphanage and when Penny was in the balcony and the sad song played. It also scared me when they were down the cave, it was really freaky, but then the happy ending was lovely and I enjoyed every minute of the movie! :)"
4,A new addition to the New Weird,"Just lovely. The ideas and landscapes are rich and gritty, the characters all the more real for their flaws. It does read like a first novel... some of the characters could have been fleshed out a little, some of the motivations a little thin. But the concepts are there, the language there, and I very much look forward to seeing what the author comes up with next."
2,Sadly Sadly,"I am afraid this tome just isnt very good. The idea is promising, but the plot is a mess and the characters are thinner than a supermodel on a diet. I stopped reading about a third of the way through. Read the Algebraist - its much better."
4,clinical coordinator,Great product. We use these daily in our orthodontic office. The only thing I would change is the bulkiness and would try to make it a little more lightweight.
4,This saucepan is great!,I absolutely love this pan! The straining feature is fantastic! The pan is heavy so I rest it against the side of the sink to help hold it steady. The handles stay cool so you don't need a potholder but you might want to use one to protect against the heat from the steam. I recently acquired the 10-pc. set of Anolon Advanced cookware and am very happy with it. The thing that bothers me most about the cookware is it takes a little longer to cook things because you can't use high heat. Boiling water takes a long time. The cookware is very sturdy and is a breeze to clean. So easy that it's not a big deal that it isn't dishwasher safe.
4,"Good pot, but handle could be better designed","I've had this pot for about 2 months now and for the most part I've found it be be an excellent pot. It's easy to clean and it looks nice. I bought this pot in part because of the straining lid, but I haven't used that function more than a handful of times since I often avoid using it so that I have one less lid to wash.My one complaint is that the insulating grip is flush with the (hot) metal part of the handle closest to the pot. Because of this, there's a likelihood for skin-metal contact, especially since this pot can get a bit heavy and thus encourages a closer grip distance; I've scorched my index finger a couple of times while grappling with the handle. If it weren't for this design flaw, I'd be perfectly happy with this pot."
2,"Super Gate, Super hard to figure out.","It took me forever to put this thing together properly, and it's not good for small doorways, there were so many panels I had to take two off. It came missing a part which really threw me for a huge loop!!! It works now, but too many screws come with it, and I would have preferred a gate that did not need to be screwed into the door frame."
4,Work well with large puppy,"This gate has worked well to keep our new large puppy out of our front room I am no longer worried about our Christmas tree and presents. I gave it only 4 stars because at times it is difficult to collapse and will jam, however it is easily remedied and is not a major issue."
1,not for dogs,i got it for my dog (beagle basset mix) and he managed to climb over it... getting a new one with not patterns on it...
1,Garbage,"Re-drilled into rail four times before giving up and returning, the gate cannot line up properly because the manufacturer didn't take into account when you pull the gate out there is a half inch discrepancy between the hinge and the opposing side.Oopsie!"
5,Great Gate,"What a great gate. The installation was very easy, and did not take much time. Very sturdy, and excellent build materials, high quality plastic. Only wish that there was a way to lock the gate open so that I didn't have to keep pushing it back every time I walk by it when I'm not using it."
5,Awesome,"This is a awesome gate, So easy to install and fit's large openings. Great for kids and pets. it even swings out of the way, when not in use."
3,Lets reissue both roads to the SB on BluRay,"I completely second the opinion of the reviewer Vaughn. NFL films, reissue the 2007 road to the superbowl along side XLVI (meaning playoff games and SB)! People will buy it!!! Heck, I bought 2007 road to the sb on dvd and I will pony up the doh for the blu ray copy. Make some money, just do it... now!"
5,Great Video and the Blu-ray is Amazing!,"A few years back I ordered the DVD for the Giant's Super Bowl XLII Victory and really enjoyed the video. I decided to not only get this DVD, but to get it in Blu-ray version for our new Blu-ray player. The video quality is amazing--it is like you are right there on the field. Like the previous DVD, they chronicle the whole season and highlight the great plays from each game. The narration and music is very well done. The footage is great. The extra coverage from the Super Bowl was very good.I do wish that they would have covered Coach Coughlin's speech that he gave his team on the night before the Super Bowl. I recall the NBC correspondent reporting that it was really inspirational. Then again it could be on the last extra segment (""Super Bowl Media Day Coverage"") or in the other extras that I have not watched. Regardless, very well done and very entertaining."
5,Got a yen to make earrings?,"If you've got the bug to make some special earrings for yourself or for a friend, this little book is a good starting place. With lots of projects of different sorts, you are sure to find something that you will want to copy line for line, or ideas that will inspire you to a new and different starting point, ultimately making something one-of-a-kind that speaks to some special love of your own.96 pages -- nice little book!"
4,HIGHLY RECOMMEND,A great overview to the history of Argentina. The only drawback is that Felix Luna does not go into the history of the dirty war. I read this book while in Buenos Aires and it was helpful in understanding the political and social history of the Argentinian people.
3,Hard for a novice,"I'm sure the book is good, but I found it difficult to sew such tiny things on the sewing machine. I have only tried the short sleeve tee shirt so far. The tee shirt material doesn't work very well with the sewing machine (the zig zag edging). So I ended up doing it by hand and it worked out fine. I'll try something else with a non-stretchy material and maybe it will work out better on the machine. I had hoped my granddaughter could help sew these things. But they are really very small and difficult to do for a youngster. She does better sewing it by hand as well."
3,bad science that inspired good writers,"Sheldon is famous for having invented a system for classifying human body shapes but according to his student, Barbara Honeyman Heath, he began by working out a classification of personalities which is described in this book. He believed that every human personality was a mixture of three components that are present in varying strengths. His system of body shapes (somatotypes) is also based on three components and according to Heath, Sheldon somehow intuited his three components of body shape by trying to visualize his three components of personality! The resulting system of somatotypes has turned out to be fairly useful which is more than can be said of Sheldon's ideas about personality. His guiding belief, that body shape and personality are correlated failed to convince his scientific peers. Sheldon had better luck among creative writers and people like Aldous Huxley and W H Auden found his theories inspiring. This is his greatest legacy."
1,...........BIG NO NO...................,THIS IS A BUNCH OF OLD FOLKLORE REWRITTEN FOR GOD KNOWSWHAT. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON IT.
1,"Wow, this is bad","The world was a much better place when I didn't know such a thing existed as this. Whoever this band is (and I think it's just one, despite ""various artists"") is pretty much the opposite of The Who."
5,incredible,I have only read the french version of this book so i can't really say anything about the english version. but this is the ONLY book i have ever re-read. it's that good. i first read it in high school as mandatory reading material and have never stopped loving it since. it's a beautiful story of friendship and love and takes place somewhere in france (it never really says where).also the author wrote this when he was very young. 19 i believe.
3,so common,"I read The Grand Meaulnes after knowing it had bee a major influence in FowlesThe Magus: I read it with real interest and expecting a great literary work: I was extremely dissapointed: I have read far better bad books by French authors: The book seemed to me just that bad French style: mysterious; mystic and set in a misty atmosphere: That is my only credit to the book; the autumn green and brown and rainy atmosphere it evoked; a depressing setting that is not fully depicted and::: The Great Gastby lacks that ""mystical"" atmosophere but tells the same story; that of something you lost and you want to recover no matter you spoilt your life in the pursuit of it: Nothing new or fascinating in the Grand Meaulnes as far I am as concerned as a reader"
3,Not as good as first two,Well I wouldn't go so far as brat but the Emma character is a little too around. I want to read a book about grownups. Also fleshing out the other adult characters gets short shift with all the emphasis on Emma. Also new is the sudden religious inferences. We are a pretty Catholic family and no one clutches their cross constantly
5,great cd!,"I heard about Blue House from my friend in Califronia, and I'm so glad I did. This is a great cd and I hope to hear more from them soon!"
4,Godzilla vs. Big Rose,"This movie is pretty good. It starts out right after Godzilla 1985, and introduces Miki Saegusa, a key player in the later movies. The dubbers calling Godzilla ""Godziller"" gets on your nerves, but Godzilla has a huge makeover in this one from G 1985. Special effecs are up to par with 1989. Definitely not asgood as Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II, but still good. Definitely worth the price. And Biollante's second stage is just plain mean looking. The huge teeth, the beady eyes, and the acid spitting tentacles are all effective for making Biollante a scary looking kaiju. Very well done, and worth buying"
3,Average Godzilla film.,"This movie is an average,but still good,Godzilla movie.But Biollante's back story dosen't add up.Yet this movie had probally the best acting in the entire Heisei Godzilla series(films 1 and 16 through 22).Good music and no new corny American filmed scenes keep it above the water."
2,Far from the best Godzilla movie,"I have nearly all the Godzilla movies but found this to be pretty bad. I loved the extras that showed how they filmed it and the hardships with the monster effects. I didn't keep this, I doubt I could sit through it again."
3,Biollante Is So Cool!!!!,"Godzilla vs Biollante is incredible! A doctor has been studying plant life along with Godzilla's cells. The doctor creates a giant plant called Biollante. Once Godzilla comes to Tokyo, Biollante fights him. After a long fight, Godzilla defeats Biollante. Later on in the movie everyone finds out that Biollante is alive! Godzilla battles a new version of Biollante. Knowing that he stands no chance, Godzilla retreats into the sea, and Biollante goes into the sky.The only reason why I gave it 3 stars was because it was boring at parts."
5,It's About Time!,"This is perhaps my favorite Godzilla film from the Heisei era as well as one of the more elusive titles in the series. That's it's finally been given an official DVD/Blu-Ray release leaves only Godzilla 1985. I am incredibly exited for this release and given the sources it seems that this won't be a typicall Echo Bridge release. It is said that it will have a commentary by Ed Godziszewski and rumored to also have bonus deleted scenes that can be found in the japanese DVD releases. Also forgot to mention will have the the japanese dub as well as english. The only complaint I have with this release is the cover art (Biollante looks like she's drowning) would have preffered the origianl HBO VHS cover, the menu also looks a little stale, but these are only minor gripes. Am really exited for this release and at the relatively cheap price any fan of Godzilla should defenetily have this in their cart. December 4th couldn't be farther away."
5,"East to assemble, fun for my 2-year-old","I found this nursery center easy to assemble. It only took about 5 minutes to put together. This was a gift for my daughter's second birthday. She loves baby dolls and has been thrilled with this center. Even her four-year-old sister (who is not into baby dolls) enjoys it and uses it to groom and wash her stuffed puppy dogs! I like the way it allows one child to use one side while another child can use the other side (less fighting over space). It is sturdy enough that it doesn't fall over on her and light enough that it is easy for me (mom) to move around when needed. It works well in my daughter's small room - I like the way it combines so many baby care items (i.e. changing table, cabinet, bath, and high chair) into one compact unit. I would definitely recommend to my friends!"
1,Not So Good,"We purchased this air mattress for Christmas company, the first night our guest slept on it was very unpleasant. It was very floppy in the morning and had lost about half of it's air! We had to scramble to find something else for the rest of their stay.We had had an Intex mattress before that was great! But it got a hole in it that why I chose to get a 2nd one but this was a big disappointment.I tried to contact the company through amazon (all the seller was not amazon) they never responded. I then went back and took a closer look at the companys return policy and found out that they do not return air mattresses! That's 50+dollars that is gone :(I may have just got a dud mattress but I'm stuck with it! My advice is look over the return policy before buying so you don't get stuck with a lemon too."
5,Who are these guys????? and why havent I heard of them,"totally insane, Ive never heard anything like it, like george clinton, and primus put togather. SEX grooves and lots of percussive bass. check it out"
2,Left Dangling,"Anil is plastic - if she has any sensitivity or cultural ties to her birth country, they are hidden. As someone born & raised in Sri Lanka, I felt the situation could have been explained MORE for the rest of the world. And SUDDENLY this plastic Anil, who has shown no feelings, no emotion (not even surprise) stands up in front of military men and a panel claiming ""YOU are killing us!"" - us? And where does this emotion come from. No-one is even sure WHY Sailor is dead - was it accidental and meant for another, was he killed by JVP for refusing to go on strike? Why was a gem-miner killed by the death squads? - nothing was explained. Even the ending - did Sarath & Gamini just die - was it a dream? Was it all just a sea bath in the Indian Ocean at Mt. Lavinia?"
4,"Civil War Without, Civil War Within","Beautifully written, poetic rendition of Sri Lanka being torn apart by civil war-subtexted in how individual's lives being ripped asunder one way or another. Very delicately nuanced descriptions of how various characters shut out the world to maintain balance and focus. Ondaatdje writes in a somewhat detached way-I felt I was viewing pain from a distance, not experiencing it with the characters-but lovely nevertheless. A reflective book from multiple POVs...I for one think Sarath was more of the central character than Anil."
2,Not His Best Work To Date,"Both the English Patient and In The Skin Of A Lion are two of my favorite books. I agree with the reviewer who said Anil is an underdeveloped character. The poetic prose that usually works so well in his books keeps you lost in this one, as the reader is not sure if some of the events are actually happening. Perhaps murder mysteries are not his forte. I look forward to his next effort and hope he can capture me with the same wonderfully developed characters of his past novels."
2,MEDIOCRE,"Some parts of the book weren't bad and it tells something about the war in Sri Lanka then flashes back to the skeleton man named Sailor that was found. Too vague and too much flashing back and I didn't care for the end. Some parts I really got into and were interesting but other parts were boring. I was dissapointed somewhat in this one. Didn't care for the plot. Would I read it again, NADA."
1,Disappointing,It is as if two different people wrote the book. The main character and the supporting characters are too fragmented. Not until the end does the prose come to life in the introduction of a minor character Gamini. The story of Sailor gets lost in the presentation of various characters who appear to do little to advance the plot. All of the characters are drawn in broad strokes inspiring little interst with the exception of Gamini. Could this have been a manuscript that the author started years ago & went back to finish? The English Patient was near perfect as any novel could be...I expected his poetic prose to fill the pages with the fire of The English Patient... Very 'unfinished'...
2,A waste of beautiful writing,"This was one of those books that I only pushed through because I was reading it for book club. And even then, I didn't finish it completely, getting the gist of the end from others in the club. There was just so much of the book I didn't care about. Some parts were interesting, but others just seemed to be there as a writing exercise.I generally read a book like this because I want to learn more about the event in the background, in this case, the Sri Lankan civil war. But I really came out of it no more knowledgeable than I was going in, and even worse, it didn't even ignite a desire to learn more from other sources. The war and its circumstances really get lost in all of Anil's... stuff.The one positive thing I can say about the book is that it really is beautifully written. I just wish those beautiful words were woven into a more cohesive and interesting story."
3,Unsuccessful,"Ondaatje is a bit of a mystery to me - I hated ""The English Patient"" but loved ""Running in the Family"", so I was expecting to have a strong reaction - one way or the other - to ""Anil's Ghost"". Unfortunately, that was not the case. The narrative is fractured - on purpose - which I felt detracted from the story even if it added some stylistic symbolism.For some reason, Ondaatje is not able to capture the human horror of his subject matter adequately in words - and perhaps no one could - but the powerful topic he was writing about was simply not captured in his tepid and detached, though ultimately very readable tone.Still - it was a decent read - and I do not think there are very many writers who could have done a better job with the subject. Some history, I suppose, is so horrid as to be beyond the reach of mere words."
5,A Classic,"Although I was blown away by ""The English Patient,"" I feel that ""Anil's Ghost"" is more cohesive and works better as a novel. Still, ""Anil's Ghost"" is not a straightforward and linear book, so it probably won't appeal to readers who like simpler, plot-oriented fare. Ondaatje is also a poet and has an amazing facility with language and emotional nuance. The book's structure is often associative rather than plot-driven, so it's as if the book was written as it was remembered or dreamed. Rather than any particular facts or events, his focus is on how those facts and events are remembered and perceived. I couldn't put this book down. Great work."
1,Drudgery,"I really wanted to give this book a chance, but am abandoning that notion. I'm halfway through it and it has become a chore to finish it. I came to this site to check out the reviews to see if other readers say it gets better towards the end, but it doesn't seem so. Overall, it seems that the readers either loved it or hated it. Unfortunately, I am of the latter opinion for the very same reasons that the ones who didn't enjoy the novel."
4,This ghost doesn't haunt like a patient,"I enjoyed this novel exploring the internal and external revolutions caused by politics, however it didn't linger with me the way The English Patient did. Initially, the narrative focuses too exclusively on Anil, and I didn't find her as interesting as Sareth and his brother. That being said, this is still a far superior novel to most of those being published today. No one peels layers of identity like Ondaatje."
3,Very fun but one wrong move and it's over,"The helicopter came in a timely manner and is very fun but of course for 50 bucks it's not going to be indestructible. I had a crash that I didn't think was too bad (I crashed it worst and it was fine) but it ripped the paper on the tail right where the propellers push their air down. So now it won't take off more than about an inch because of the rip. I tried using different amounts of tape or glue but it just won't do what it used to do. Lasted about three weeks for me and loved it while I had it.Pros: Cheap, fun, chases my dogs very well, fairly easy to control once you figure out the trim.Cons: One little rip and it could be all over, be careful.Overall: I'm not mad that I bought it I was just disappointed that it didn't last very long. But I guess it's too be expected."
1,Giggle Bugs,Do not buy this book. The flaps are all text. There are no fun surprises under the flaps. Very boring flaps.
3,"Good, but won't change your life","This is a very nice movie, that will make for a pleasant evening of viewing, but is not the masterpeice many people decsribe below. All the parts are well played and everyone is likable enough. Burt Lancaster is terrific as the aging oil tycoon.I bought this movie in part because Mark Knopfler did the score, but his signature ""sound"" (if you've seen ""The Princess Bride"" or ""Cal"" you know what I'm talking about) is almost nowhere to be heard.The picture quality of the dvd is very good (at least the widescreen version is, I haven't watched the pan & scan side of this disc), the colors are realistic, the pictures are sharp, and the contrast is good. The soundtrack is an unremarkable mono, but all the dialogue is clear.I would have given it three and a half stars if Amazon allowed such a thing. I was not sorry I bought it."
3,Worth a look...,"This little-know bit of surrealist deconstruction remains poignantly relevant. Especially as the debate over the ANWR heats up, here in the US."
4,A great little film -- and a nicely priced dvd,"One of my favorite films growing up, I was both surprised and pleased to find that Warner Brothers had released it on DVD. No extras save for a theatrical trailer -- but that's okay. The movie looks nice, even at an average bit rate (hovering around five, but I've seen much worse).Regarding another person's review of the sound: keep in mind that this film was originally in mono. The reason it isn't in dolby surround (or even stereo), is because it wasn't in stereo in the first place. I thought it sounded pretty good for a mono recording."
5,AN AMAZING FILM,"Plot descriptions of ""Local Hero"" don't do it justice because everything turns on the humanity of these characters, all of whom the filmmaker clearly adores. As many times as I've seen it, it always leaves me feeling happier, more spacious inside, more alive to life's mysteries."
5,A beautiful comedy,"A very quiet, warm comedy about the pleasures of life found in pristine places. A Houston-based oil company wants to buy a whole village in Scotland for an oil refinery and sends a representative (Peter Riegert) to make a deal. The twist is that the townspeople can't wait to sell and make all the money they can. Gradually Riegert comes to love the place and wants to chuck his yuppie lifestyle and move there. Bert Lancaster is the CEO of the oil company, more enchanted with astronomy than oil. This is a rare comedy of a different sort - more like the pleasure of warm brandy on a winter's night than raucousness. Very appealing and well done all around. Definitely worth a watch."
5,Local Hero -- Next generation?,"I see that Amazon is temporarity out of stock and hope the ratings will tell the industry to fix up the next iteration for us Local-Hero-phyles. I've only seen it on square-TV and can't imagine the impact of the fog, the coast, and the lights on full screen. I've only heard the transistor radio sound quality. Still, I rent this every four years or so, just to see if the deep gut chuckles are still there-- and they are. There will always be the divide between the five and the one-star reviews for any film, but I'm reassured by the ratio on the bar chart here."
1,great film but a Mono DVD? outrageous,"I love the film, I own the soundtrack but why would anyone release a mono DVD. The sound is awful. I wish I hadn't bought it ."
1,no delivery,"this DVD was not delivered - I received a message from ""Emerson House"" -Good day,Unfortunately, we could not deliver postal package sent 01 April, As the recipient's address does not exist.Please, print out the bill of lading that is in the attached document, and collect your parcel in our office at the address indicated in the bill of lading.Best regards,Emerson HouseThe correct address was provide so I think this message is nonsense. Very disappointing!"
2,Very disappointing,"This movie was hyped-up to be something almost cult-like and very funny. I found it flat and painfully slow. The acting and story-line was very lacking. Some scenery was very pretty, but overall, one was just waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. One big *thud*."
1,Local Zero,Here's a list to decribe this movie 1. dumb2 stupid3boring4 bad actors5 weak plot6 makes no senseIf you find any of these qualities apealing this is the movie for you.
2,"Boring and very dissappointing compared to ""say goodnight gracie"".","I was very dissappointed with this book. Say goodnight gracie was an excellent book. I baught this one because it was by the same author, but it may as well not have been. The wrighting was terrible compared to the first book."
3,A Good Read,"I liked this story. I am not particular familiar with the history of the French Revolution, but the book had enough references to seem credible. The one problem is that the story of the secret marriage between Maria Fitzherbert and Prince George the Vth is randomly intermingled with Sophie's narration. I found that the side-story of the marriage was more interesting than that which the novel was centered around, and found myself skipping forwards to parts that were about Maria Fitzherbert and her husband. Perhaps it is not as interesting to others, but I found myself greatly distracted."
2,Keep your expectations low,A lot of eye rolling and groaning with the acting and storyline. But you have to understand that this was made 30 years ago.
3,Christmas Snow,An old fashioned sweet Christmas movie. Excellent to show to early middle schoolers who are learning English as a foreign langage. Not for young people who are looking for wild adventures.
5,Beautiful in so many ways,"This is a beautifully illustrated book and a beautiful story with wonderful messages about bravery, what girls should focus on (playing and learning instead of vanity), wisdom of ancestors, adults honoring children's desires while also standing their ground and providing wise guidance. It's also a lovely way to learn a bit about West African people and customs. I recommend it highly."
5,My daughter's new favorite book!,"We checked this book out from the library yesterday and my daughter had finished reading the entire story before me made it home. After finishing, she asked if we could keep the book instead of returning it to the library. After reading the story with her, I had to purchase this book for her. It's a beautiful Afrikan-Centered children's book and a beautiful story, full of Afrikan tradition and culture. I prefer my children read books that deal with real life as opposed to fairy tales. This is a story we can actually see ourselves in, unlike Snow White, Cinderella and the likes. I highly recommend this book for young Afrikan children, especially those in the Diaspora."
4,Great product after I cleaned it,Came in a nice protected box but the middle section of the board had a sticky substance on it that made it impossible to use until it was thoroughlly cleaned. It almost looked like it had been used before. Once it was cleaned it was fine though. All in all a good product.
5,Leo is the BEST actor and BEST looking guy for sure!!!,"I think Leo is an great actor and was suberb in What's eating Gilbert Grape, he is always great in his movies but not all talented actors can perform with such great skills as Leo did! END"
4,A Quiet Gem,"This is a quiet, intriguing, and odd little film. It has it's little charm. Johnny Depp, who is very good, plays Gilbert Grape wrestling to take care of his family, which includes his morbidly obese mother, and his mentally retarded brother played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who will knock your pants off in a flat out brilliant performance. He deserved the Oscar for this. This is an interesting film. It's sad, in a way, and that's why it's odd. You want to be sad but the characters themselves don't show enough emotion. It's like they don't care enough. That's one of the oddities that fill this movie. Darlene Cates, who plays the mother, is wonderful. She, and Leonardo, are real. They bring it off so believeably. Do yourself a favor and give this hidden gem a try."
2,Unwatchable,"Okay, granted, I watched about eight minutes of it, but not only did it not hook me, but it repelled me. Before I rake it out, I have two positive things to say: Johnny Depp acted well, and Leonardo DiCaprio, whom I generally cannot watch at all, portrayed the developmentally disabled boy impressively.So, my beefs:1) It reminded me of a non-comedic version of Pink Flamingos, which itself was only watchable because it was comedic.2) Too much weirdness, not enough hook. I'm not into gratuitous freak shows.3) I didn't like the sexual undercurrent vibe -- creeped me out. And when the middle aged lady started coming on to Johnny Depp's character I turned it off. Too pervy and weird.Enough said."
4,Depressing but excellent film.,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape starring Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio is a straight-to-the-point kind of film and I appreciate that. There's no sugar-coating or preaching, just a profound, honest film about a family who is anything but ordinary. DiCaprio is 100% flawless in this tearjerker. Great story and incredible acting, buy this cult classic today!"
3,Intriguing Character Study,"Certainly one of Lasse Hallstrom`s better movies (""Chocolat"" and ""The Cider House Rules"", anyone?), this little and subtle drama resembles TV-movie-of-the-week territory, but the honest emotion of the plot and the fine, believable acting turn this into an above-average cinematic experience. Yet another indie movie about dysfunctional families, offbeat characters, little towns and boring lives, ""What`s Eating Gilbert Grape"" presents a simple yet well-crafted story with some big league actors around (Johnny Depp, Julliette Lewis and a surprising Leonardo DiCaprio). Hardly innovative, this effort proves that what you need to make a good movie is to have solid acting, a decent plot and competent cinematography.Not a masterpiece, just a pleasant and genuine drama."
4,What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a classic movie. Althought it is shown occationally on tv i had not seen it since high school and my husband had never seen it. he enjoyed this renting this movie, as did i"
5,All together I thought that this movie was wonderful,This was a heart touching movie it was well put and everyone should see it weather you like Leonardo DiCaprio or not.When I seen we looked EVERYWHERE for it until we looked on here and found it! so just go out rent it buy it whatever just see it!
2,Disappointing book,"Quite disappointed with the content and writing.Bad jokes were littered around here and there.Not a very practical book, too much theory and talks a lot on things that most people already know. Language used is too flowery."
3,Alright.,"This is actually a sequel to the first Godzilla film (which strangely is still unobtainable in the UK) and starts off very well. Though there are some good visual fx, it just seems to run out of steam halfway through. There are extended scenes of Godzilla doing nothing but standing about. And the added-on scenes showing various troops drinking cans of Dr Pepper is the kind of tacky commercialisation films can do without. All too often the western distributors of these films seem to make a slapdash job of editing and dubbing them, and that's what has occured here.Not one of the worst Godzillas I've seen by a long shot and certainly head and shoulders over that abominable US version, but it ought to have been better."
2,bad movie.....but GREAT music.,"this movie was o.k. but the special effects aren't that good and the dudding is terrible and ther were some plot holes i think this movie should be better off without the anmerican parts. but the music in hear was great very dramatic and evil music for a g-film, so i bought the sountrack with other hesisi g-movies.so good music in a dissappointing movie if you want a really good godzilla movie check out godzilla vs. destroyer. by the way the name is j.d."
2,Bad start to Heisei Godzilla series.,"This movie is just plain bad.Raymond Burr's performance,unlike his 1956 one,is horrible and takes alot away from the US filmed scenes at the Pentagon.And what's with launching a srategic nuke at another one?It just can't be that accurate.Godzilla vs. Biollante,the sequel,is even better than this bad film."
1,"Sorry, can't recommend.","Sorry, I can't recommend this book. There are simply too many errors for it to be considered useful.I realize it is written for a young audience, but that is no reason to condone numerous mistakes of fact, omission and interpretation.The Esselen are a fascinating, and unfortunately little known group in central California. I have been studying this group for over 30 years, and had hoped for better; I am very disappointed in the way this book turned out."
2,Only one per package,"Good product, exactly what I was expecting, but there's only one in the package and the product description says there are two. So, now I think the price is too high. Would give 5 stars, but since I got half an order I'll have to give half the rating."
4,great educational book for new positions..,Not only is this book educational as far as new inspiring positions for you and your partner but this book also is pretty funny.. Me and my girlfriend seen this book and had to have it.. We bought it and have enjoyed it ever since.. great gift idea too..
5,One CREEPY Flick,"I'm a big Mickyey Rourke fan, as an aside, what in the world happened to him, he blew up like a ballon. Steroids? Anyways, this is my favorite Rourke movie and he's superb in the roll of a private eye on the downside. Alan Parker creates an atmosphere that's dark, evil, and builds in creepiness. Watch for the fans, even into the final scene. I've seen this movie 10 times and I still get goosebumps watching it at nite, alone."
5,""" I know who I am...""","No, he doesn't.Angel Heart centers around a down in the dumps private detective, Harry Angel and Lou Cyphere, obviously the devil. Well, not obvious to me at first...ha!The only bad part about this movie is the fuss people made over it. The voodoo dance scenes were apparently fairly in keeping with tradition. Voodoo practioners had a problem with this movie centering around a ""devil"" character since there is no devil figure in voodoo. However...the devil character has very little attachment to the voodoo practices, it just happens to be how the devil got involved with Johnney (the missing crooner).Mickey Rourke is stellar in this movie..Bonet is enchanting...Deniro is flawless.Worth owning!"
3,Very Hot Erotic Thriller,"The performences are very good but not as good as the big bloody sex scene, it will leave you stuned! It starts out with them dancing to music then they start kissing and lay on the bed. Then you see them having sex with him kissing her near her bare breasts. She has her bare feet wraped around his butt and legs. It starts to get more intense when the blood starts coming. They start to move back and forth harder. Her bare feet jump in the air. Then shows other scenes then comes back. It shows reactions on her face as they are havng sex. Their bare feet touch several times. Finally, she screams because it get to intense and he gets off. Very good Erotic which gets 3 stars."
5,An underrated european poet,"Although some other spanish poets such as Federico García Lorca or Rafael Alberti are more popular in America, among the spaniards Cernuda is considered to be the best one. Why do i have titled an ""european poet""? Because he probably was the most european of all the poets of what it's been called "" La Generación del 27"". He always loved the Coleridge, Donne, ... you can follow that trace in his poetry. He has also been the most influential poet among spanish poets. So, I think this is a good chance to get to know one of the most interesting and unknown european poet of this century."
5,Will last 5 years minimum,"Sony SPP-H273 Additional Handset for Sony Cordless Telephones SPP-S2720/S2730/A2770/A2780It is replacement/addition for existing one - now I have two handsets. New has 5 years to go :) . I based my opinion on the existing handset. Old is giving me a hard time due to dialing keys: when you push a button it does not responds, or dials dbl, triple. It took 6 YEARS, till it started failing. Now old one is just for answering calls."
5,Inventive and colorful adventure.,"The Mystery of Jaguar Reef is an audiobook on CD once heard on National Public Radio, featuring a full cast production with music by Tim Clark and environments recorded in Belize. When investigator Jack Flanders is on the trail of a mystery involving a drastic personality change, he finds his way to the shores of Belize in Central America, and uncovers a mysterious pirate wreck. Matters shift from odd to downright bizarre as Jack finds himself at the helm of the inexplicable pirate ship - ascending into the tropical night sky and wondering if an alien plot is afoot! Equal measures of wry humor and surreal surroundings distinguish this inventive and colorful adventure. 2 CDs, 2 hours."
2,Little Ado About Something,"I've read two or three books about the SR-71 and YF-12 that describe their unique and innovative design and construction. To me, like Seymour Cray's original supercomputers, the SR-71 reflects pure design and engineering genius.I've seen an SR-71 flying low and _slow_, and I've heard the roar of its engines being tested on the desert flats. These amazingly sleek and compact planes are as fast as they look.Thus with this background, I watched the SR-71 segment but found the narration repetitive and uninformative. There's dead air, dark images of the Blackbird in darkness, duplicate scenes, and no drama or insight. Given that the SR-71 is a majestic and impressive feat of engineering, this DVD represents a lost opportunity and, unfortunately, a waste of time."
2,"Somewhat basic, almost common knowledge","While there are some simple models to explain how the competitive landscape is changing from traditional economics (physical inputs) to the economics of information, it does not delve any deeper.There are several examples of successful business models which accurately positioned themselves relative to the breadth and depth of the market (in the book called reach and richness), but most of it is common knowledge. Dell's mass customization. Schwab's lead to discount brokerage.For those who have read popular newspaper, or magazine articles about how the internet is changing business ~ this book might bore. It paints broad strokes and seems even outdated given that it was published so recently."
2,Tell me something I haven't heard already,"The book provides its reader with lots of good information and case studies. However, it doesn't tell you anything that you haven't heard 1,000 times before. I thought the last 10-15 pages of the book were really helpful (great summary) - but the first 4/5's of the book was standard repetition."
3,Save the time and read their Harvard Business Review pieces!,A nice book with some really interesting material. Most of their examples are quite fascinating. Has a fast paced tone to it. Was a disappointment in substantive terms since their Harvard Business review pieces covered the same ground a lot more succinctly. Save yourself the time and read those pieces instead. The central concept of the reach v. richness tradeoff is quite appealing however. You will find some useful tips on actionable ideas originating from the key concepts. I know there is a lot of hype about this book but don't expect too much because you will be let down.
4,Needs more of a direction,"This is a very good book, but can be frustrating to read because the authors meticulously keep from being decisive about possible outcomes at points. Even if wrong, it is often useful to take a stance and then matters clarify. Smart people who have a great grasp of these issues, but stopped short."
3,Good but not great,"Pros: Great steam, large water tank, solid construction, electronic displayOK: Spray mists better if you hold iron above the clothes. If you spray while ironing you get too much water on clothes.Cons: On/Off button is on handle so too easy turn off while using. The weight isn't balanced at the point where you hold on to the iron so it feels awkward.I'd look around more before buying this one again."
3,Dazed and Confused,This book will leave you dazed and confused if you don't have a lot of mathematical background. The authors assume that you already know everything about algebra and don't really explain certain things or steps that you need to take to get a certain answer. In order to completely understand this book you need the intermediate algebra book that has been written by almost all the same authors... If you don't use the intermediate algebra book as a reference you'll just be dazed and confused!
2,Oddly Modern. And not so much fun.,"Sonny Lester's other ""strip"" albums, reissued on CD under various titles, sound like great products of the Les Baxter exotica period, with orchestral instruments enriching with their lushness the va-va-voom swing band.But THIS CD is an entirely different matter. Sounds like 80s studio funk, essentially [forgettable] male soul crooning. Like Tim Meadows ""Ladies' Man"" would sip Curvoissier to.I was very disappointed. I like the harp and Bas Sheva ooh-ing on his other releases. (""AnnCorio presents...."" and the ""How To Belly Dance"" album.This CD does come with a cheeky instruction booklet, which DOES have an naughty-naught quality which seems of the period of Lester's more fun older recordings.Best thing about this CD is the credit:""Instruction Booklet by Art Shulman, former executive at Seventeen and TV Guide"""
1,Not what pictured!!!,"I orderd these cups believing I will get the dinosaur ones as pictured, but instead got flower ones. My son is not going to use the flower cups!"
2,description is wrong,"In the description of this product, the ""target gender"" is listed as male...so I ordered them. But I received sippy cups that are pink with flowers and butterflies. It could be that this design got sent to me by mistake, but based on other reviews of playtex sippy cups it seems that this is a problem they have not worked out for ordering online. I wouldn't recommend you order sippy cups online unless you could use cups for either gender because you don't know what you're going to get and they're not worth trying to return...better to buy them from the store. Playtex does make a great sippy cup though."
3,I love Playtex sippys!!!,I gave this cup a low review because the paint scratches off and it looks ugly after a while. But I love their new coolster and the non insulated cups. They do have new insulated sippys with a halogram design that is cute and doesnt scratch. I dont have a problem with my son hurting himself while drinking because he is usually in his highchair when he drinks out of it.
4,You will need this silicone case,"If you're going to purchase this Sansa MP3 player (and I highly recommend the player), you will need this case. So go ahead and get it; you'll be glad you did. The case is fine--easily pops on and off the player when you need to change batteries. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that the clip really grabs and it's very difficult to unclip once it's clipped onto your clothing. I guess this is probably a good thing if you're a runner, which I am not; I just wear it at the gym."
3,functional,"its a functional case, fits the player snugly and will protect it if its dropped. however, i don't like that it doesn't cover the little window on the player."
4,Worth the money,I purchased 3 of these for my husband and 9 year old twin girls. We have had them for 7 months now and they have worked very well. We use Rhapsody to download music. I couldn't justify the money for Ipods and to be honest I don't really think an Ipod would have any better advantage. We were able to purchase a stereo system that allows you to plug in your MP3 player which works great with the Sandisk. We also have been able to play it in our Jeep. It is easy to operate and even with all the songs we have downloaded there is still plenty of room left as it will store 19 hours of songs.
4,Every Seattleite has to own a copy!,"If you know Seattle, it is hard to look at this movie objectively -- it's too much fun! Like the Seattle Asian Art Museum converted into Divine's mansion; the shoot-out that shatters Dale Chihuly's reject glass scultures (and caused the local artists to cheer when it was shown in the theaters). Then there's our joke of a monorail built for the Seattle World's Fair (what? You didn't know Seattle had a world's fair?). In the movie it is periodically shown racing through the night, while in reality it's only a few blocks long.As I recall (it has been decades since I saw it) it is an enjoyable movie, and with such big name stars, I can't understand why it isn't out on DVD. If it was I'd buy one for mysef and several others as presents."
2,azspirit,"I sent this back because screws were missing and it was damaged in transport.Otherwise, I imagine it would have fit on my Ford F150 and looked good."
3,"Works well, but leaves marks/dents on doorway or wall!","This gate does it's job - snugly fastens to walls or doorways to create a barrier. However, i noticed after using the gate for a week or so that it has left a series of indentations or dents on the doorframe. It seems this gate has a design defect in that the main bar used to expand the gate extends slightly past the edge of the gate, cutting into the wall when it is used. Since i am a renter, i am not so pleased with the damage it has caused. It is mild, but still noticeable, and will require repairs."
4,Does what it should...,"I bought this gate to keep a large dog in our kitchen while we were away at work. It is extra wide and taller then regular baby gates which is good for our use. The opening to the kitchen is exactly 50"", the stated max width of the gate, so I was worried about this gate holding firmly enough. I was happy to find that it fits well and I still have one more notch on the gate if I wanted to make it super tight. Nothing special about this gate but it does what I want it to for the time being. Time will tell how it holds up."
3,doggie gate,I converted mine to open in the middle. I am in a wheel chair and needed it to swing back in the middle for me to go through it. Works better with a piano hinge on each end and opening in the middle. I use a hook & eye on top and 3 small bunge cords to close where it overlaps.
1,crap,"The ""solid wood"" is soft pine. The entire thing feels flimsy and the frame will bend under tension from the middle rod -- so much so the MIDDLE of the edges will touch your wall and be the pressure point rather than the two rubber points on either side. This will put dents in your wall or woodwork. This is nothing like the gate we had for my dog growing up. Do not buy."
5,Ready to use immediately.,I have had other gates that required assembly and/or never fit as snugly. Money wasted! This is the only gate I need for a variety of door and hallways in my home.
1,I wouldn't buy them even if they were free,"I bought these thinking how bad can they be? I needed some ... headphones to replace my ones for listening to music off my computer at work. I'm not a sound afficionado, but even I could tell the difference. Everything sounded flat. I ended having to throw them out and buy another pair. I ended up getting Sony MDR-ED228 ear buds. Don't waste your money on the Coby CV123 3-in-1 Combo Earphones. All three are bad."
4,"Fun, funky songs that lift your spirit!",I bought this cd as a birthday gift for my 14-year old nephew who is a huge fan of big band/swing music. It was greatly enjoyed by everyone at his party - including his grandparents. The music has a classic swing party feel! The lyrics to the songs are fun - you find yourself singing along. I think I could become a big fan of Louis Jordan. I plan on ordering several more copies as Christmas gifts. Highly recommended!
5,High Flight in Black and White,"I wasn't exactly expecting much, but boy was I wrong! Yes, it's a bit corny, but how deliciously so! Imagine ""I Love Lucy"", only replace it with ""I Love the USAF"", pack it with airplanes, manly men, a few cigarettes, toss in a thermonuclear bomb here and there, and voila: Steve Canyon. It's a great window into the 1950's America and USAF. Loved every minute of it. Can't wait for the remaining episodes."
5,Non-stop Fun,"We purchased this for our next door neighbor's almost 3-year old. He was able to take it right out of the box and play with it immediately, a definate bonus. The ship has lots of built-in activities which means lots of hours of play. Durable, great design, a real winner."
