3,Cute but not what I was expecting,"I ordered this book for my 4 years old son as a birthday gift, but I was not impressed with the quality of the pictures - kind of faded, cheep looking print. The stories were cute, but the book overall did not have the qualities I was looking for. I decided to return it and pick something else instead."
3,Some surprises,"Louise Fletcher in what promised to be a sexploitation flick? Not a whole lot of sex, Fletcher was fine and the twin brothers were fairly amusing. Still could have found something better to do for this time however."
4,Escape from everyday life,"I happened to run across this DVD while browsing on the web. I found it to be a convenient way to escape the stress of my everyday life, especially in the winter. Has none of that crappy New Age music, just the real sounds of the ocean. A great way to lie on the couch read a book or just zone out and stare at the beach scenes on the TV. Looks good on a TV. If you like this one, I recommend getting the Mediteranean Escape DVDs. I'd actually get those first, as I feel they are better done. But the beach scenes in this DVD are stricly tropical, if that's more your taste."
5,brush my teeth,Both of our pet dogs love to have their teeth brushed daily. Our cat is a bit more difficult. I wrap her in a towel and that simplifies everything. This is a great product and our pets like the toothpaste.
5,Perfect,"This is the best ever perfomance by Victor Wooten,Stieve Smith,overall it's perfect concert,and there is alive spirit ofJACO PASTORIUS !!!"
2,Didn't work,"I bought this because of recent sleeping troubles due to losing a family member and some other things. I took it for a week or so and I didn't see any progress in helping me fall asleep. I'd used this with other things such as eliminating caffeine, sugar & alcohol and all the things sleep experts recommend. I'm a big believer in using natural herbs when and where circumstances permit. This just didn't work for me. I thought maybe I could use it for anxiety as needed like I've read some people do. When I tried that I felt very zoned out and a little nervous at the same time I only took 2 maybe that was too many. I researched it and some people have a sensitivity to this. From the reviews on this site it seems to work well for many people. If you are looking to relax or for help falling asleep try it and see if it works for you. If not then you are one step closer to finding out what does."
3,potency not indicated,"I would like to know how many mgs of valerian root is in this product. It doesn't say on the front of the bottle,or anywhere in the description. Please fix.Thank you."
4,My wife likes the product,My wife uses the product and love it. The product helps her to get better sleep. Ant the product is reasonably priced...
2,BE CAREFUL,"I take a variety of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety pills. I tried using Valerian as an alternative to my anti-anxiety pill and had an adverse affect. The first day I took one in the morning and one at night. I felt euphoric and slept well. By the fourth day, my stomach was bloated till it was hard, I felt anxious and almost had an anxiety attack. My heart beat hard and fast and I was short of breath. Went off it right away and went back to my anti-anxiety pill. Be very careful if you are taking any kind of prescription meds."
2,A modern day Victor/Victoria that has more misses than hits,"I hate to be so cruel to a gay-genre movie (as I have most of them), but the truth must be told. This was a heavily watered-down Victor Victoria with a splash of Sister Act for the plot and a dash of dashed hopes for the ending. The acting was only fair, at best. Sure...there were those heart-felt moments, but they felt more produced than natural. Sure...there are a few laughs, but they were definetly constructed as laugh-points and lost their effect. As for overall comedic value, this film gets a 3/10.Compare these to some of my favorites: To Wong Foo, Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Victor/Victoria. You'll see where this film flops in production and quality.Sorry Connie and Carla...but the show's over."
4,cute gender-bending comedy,"CONNIE AND CARLA is a cute little comedy starring Nia Vardalos and Toni Collette, two appealing and capable leading ladies and featuring a script that plays like a goofy combo of SOME LIKE IT HOT and VICTOR/VICTORIA.After witnessing a horrible crime, Connie and Carla (Nia Vardalos and Toni Collette) decide to go on the run. Arriving in Los Angeles, the girls quickly decide to re-invent their old dinner theatre musical act, and pose as drag queens in a struggling cabaret bar.This movie is actually quite delightful. Vardalos and Collette make an irresistible comedy team, and the girls actually sung all their numbers themselves (Collette starred on Broadway in THE WILD PARTY). Debbie Reynolds turns in a hilarious cameo (belting out ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"", Rizzo's big number from GREASE), and the supporting cast, led by David Duchovny, Stephen Spinella and Dash Mihok is sensational.For musical theatre fans, CONNIE AND CARLA is highly-recommended."
3,Standard so-so fare,"I'm not sure what happened, but it has been quite some time since I've actually been *pleased* by an entry from the Battletech series. I remember reading Heir to the Dragon, and falling absolutely in love with the intrigue, excitement, and characters of the Inner Sphere. I've read every book in the series since... and it just seems each gets simpler, and simpler, and more cliche.. and lamer.. and lamer..This isn't a bad book, compared to the past..5-10 in the series. However, I just have problems with the way the characters develop. We have a war hero, supposedly forced to confront his worst fear, rebel against authority, place his planet under great danger, and fight a war against a man he respects,... and yet he makes the choice so easily and willingly. Is he torn? So the book tells us.. but I wouldn't mind if occasionally these pulp authors actually SHOWED us occasionally."
3,Tandia,"An eye-opener to apartheid in South Africa. Thank God that regime has ended, but, not before Africans suffered such brutality as did Tandia. I read it as a sequel to, ""The power of One"".In that context, does Tandia have a good chance with Peekay? Is their relationship possible? Is it realistic? Does it survive all the obstacles like children, living in (which) community?After reading this book I was left with more questions than answers and a definite depression for her loss of innocence in the most brutal and tragic of ways. She was treated as less than human. No emotional healing can come from any relationship, survive though she did.By Elizabeth Laine, author of, ""A Butterfly landed an Eagle""."
2,Possible subtitle: The Power of Schlock,"It is hard to believe that this book was written by the author of The Power of One. What I'd hoped would be a fitting sequel was, as another reviewer aptly described it, ""Harold Robbins""-ish. Contrived and cliche-ridden, none of the warmth and beauty of its predecessor - not quite a disaster, but not worth the agony of reading tortured descriptions such as ""socks as white as driven snow"" while trying to ignore the inexplicable plot devices and coincidences that moved the turgid prose to its inevitable conclusion. This book needed a judicious editor. The only reason I gave it two stars was that the historical references encouraged me to read more about apartheid and its impact on the country and its people."
3,just ok,i was disappointed with this movie. i thought it would be more about what happened and then the trial and i tend to think that it had more made up stuff and a lot less fact based information. it was not that good at all
5,The Fighting Seabees,"Have watched this movies over the years on TV/Satellite. I really enjoy this movie and John Wayne. Received the movie in great condition and got it before estimated shipping time. If you like John Wayne and war movies, this is a great movie."
3,Holding on....,"This album was released after Entre el Cielo y el Infierno which was recorded with Mario Ian as a vocalist and was indeed Rata's worst release. Rata Blanca VII introduces a new vocalist (Gabriel Marian) and a great change in Rata's sound. It is still better than Entre el Cielo y el Infierno, but does not reach the level the band used to have. This was theri last album before splitting in 1999. Check out La historia de un muchacho, Rey de la revolucion, La caja, Mr. Cosmico, Vieja Lucy and La cancion del sol (one of Rata's best ballads)."
3,Master Spare Wheel Lock,"Strong and well made item for the money. I had to use 2 flat washers (each 3/32"" thick) to enable me to use it on my 2005 Jeep Liberty as the Jeep center cap on the spare wheel prevented the outer casing of the lock from inserting all the way down so that the key could be turned. No big deal, still a good buy!"
5,Great and Easy to install,"Best investment to stop your spare from finding a new home! Easy to install, did it in less than a minute! Highly recommend it."
1,Doesn't fit,Bought this for my 2010 Rubicon spare tire. Doesn't even come close to fitting. Wish it would have said something about what vehicles it does fit.
4,Mater Product,"This is a Master lock, seems to work OK, but the keys are made of some cheap stamped metal. Like any lock that is exposed to the elements, you would be advised to put some oil it with WD40 or PCL in it from time to time."
5,This Book is Great!,"This book really taught me a lot about applying make-up and great ways to wear it.I would reccomend this for ages 12-20.This book is wonderful for those who are just beginning on the make-up adventure and those who already know a lot. It even includes articles about hair, and all different kinds of racial beauty. I liked that it was not focased on stereotypical girls. I loved it and you should read it to!"
5,Practical guide for teens!,"I love that my daughter talked me into this purchase! Very practical guide to make-up and skin care. It encourages ""less is more"" and a more natural beauty."
2,Waste of Money,"This book gets a 2star rating, Yess it my look like a great book. She gives great advice, but the make up in the book is TERRIBLE. She consisders the other ethic races by giving them there on chapter, but the make up is Horrible. I didnt like that at all."
5,Despair and Deception Love's ugly little twins,"I discovered Nick Cave by listening to Murder Ballads- which is a great album but this album is even better. Cave takes the main theme of love and writes beautiful (Nobody's Baby Now) and scary (Loverman) songs. The lyrics are the work of a true poet - the first true Rock-Poet since Jim Morrison. Only one song doesn't mention love and it is Red-Right Hand . It is a very good song, creepy and powerful, yet if you listen to it then to Song of Joy on Murder Ballads it becomes scary. The music is varried ranging from Cohenlike ballad (Let love in) to frenzied rock (Thhirsty Dog, Jangling Jack) One of the greatest albums ever."
3,Lucky if liking,"These barroom belters aren't as overrated as much of Cave's touted catalog, though hardly essential listening."
3,Too bad the company doesn't believe that people like to sun,"Very comfortable but as some others said, to me sunbathing means lying on my stomach as well as on my back, so I have been tracking down other chairs that I can lay on my stomach, I called the company and they didn't seem to care."
4,Most Comfortable Seat In/Out of the House!!!,"First of all, of course you can obtain parts for these chairs. The instructions are included with each chair complete with part numbers for the complete cover set, set of laces, armrests...etc. Go to any local LaFuma dealer. I found the elastic cords on line for less than twenty bucks. SitinComfort dot com has them, but I have not purchased anything from them yet.Second, this chair is the most comfortable, relaxing chair I have ever owned. I bought them because one reviewer said that the chairs were so comfortable that it was hard to get people to leave them outside. Same thing here. I am buying more of them, they seem to be a great deal at this price.They are fairly lightweight so they are nicely portable.The only fault I can find is that the chairs will rust if the powdercoating is chipped. I am careful not to bang them around."
1,Just fell apart in 6 months,After 6 months...The elastic that holds the chair seat together rots. We dont even keep it directly in the sun.Once the elastic rots the whole chair comes apart. Maybe I can use bungee chords to put it back together
5,the poetically ananlytical voice of nothingness,"This book exceeds the linguistical capacity of appraisal. The intro- well constructed, cleanly written- has tranfixed an elusive Sartre that resides under the appearence of Sartre. The translation is utterly perfected to echo the nuances of Sartre's analytical style. Through Sartre's analysis, one becomes aware of the meaning of the poet. From the floating pen of Mallarme, to the analytical precision of Sartre, to the beautifly rendered translation of Sturm, including an introduction that surpasses the fragile, uninformative, existence of intro's, and stands alone as a well-composed critical essay, the english reader has been granted a gift. Without reading this, you're Sartrean perspective wobbles hopelessly on one leg. Highly recommended."
3,Missing Images,"As a teacher, I was looking for a copy that I could display on my smartboard. I had an orginal from when the article was first published in Science World. I was disappointed that no images were included - the article was only text."
3,Is general information but not a complete source,"I love to make natural soaps and I collects book that refers to soapmaking. For a person that already knows how to make soaps, this book is full of ideas. However this book is not for the novice soapmaker, since it lacks of alot of information which is vital for a beginer. A novice should look some place else for more deep information in order to ensure that he/she learn the ups and down of soapmaking. Other than this, it has nices photos."
2,"Great first impression, short shelf life.","Bought the set as a wedding gift for a friend and had it sent to his town, so I haven't seen the product myself. Apparently, he loved the set when he took it out of the box. After two weeks the silver began to peel off. Very, very embarassing. The seller responded promptly to the complaint over email, but the refund process was too cumbersome for the situation."
2,More than a mystery...,"A big dissappointment too. Daudaurt is a great writer, but ""Bridge"" falls short. Find some of his earlier work if you can."
3,I liked it,"People keep comparing it to other Lucio flicks but I liked it because it wasn't like the other Fulci flicks. One person on another site said it best calling it a fairy tale. It's a fairy tale but with dark overtones.Still I really thought it was decent. Sort of like a ""Tales of the Darkside"" type of atmosphere with the parents being killed then coming back as ghosts and speaking to the kids (who are the only ones that see them while the relatives think they're nuts).Acting was ok. There's even a few comedy moments in the film (guy's hand melting and the crane that has a mind of it's own, the old man whose a psychic, conjurer whatever he is confronting the spirits.I think if you're in for a different type of movie from the director this is worth looking at. For me it's a type of love story that expands even through death."
4,for those who eat-to-exercise,"I bought this book because I wanted help gaining weight. Seriously. Anyway, this book provides basic information on how to eat effectively if you exercise. The first half details carbohydrates, protein, fat, water and vitamins. The latter half discusses eating plans and calorie intake. I would like to see a revised edition (this edition is from 1991; perhaps her other book is an update of sorts) discussing some of that frou-frou wellness stuff, types of protein (e.g. soy versus whey), amino acids, etc. But it's a good book and it was hard to locate among all of those weight-loss specific books."
4,Fascinating Read,"While some people live double lives, Richard Cain led triple lives, and this book fills in many of the blank spots in the lives of this dark, but fascinating mob and CIA figure."
1,NG,"This book is poorly written, has long boring stretches and I quit reading it about one quarter of the way through."
4,Very Cute,My 8 year old daughter looked very cute in this - the wig was a tad small but we were able to secure it with hair pins.
1,Mystery of the missing cards,"thought i would get both the tarot cards and manual with my purchase.Received manual,but no cards.I am still waiting......Carla Walsh,Manchester."
5,Historical Fiction,I enjoyed this book. The author was careful to enumerate just enough facts to support his story. The Tale of how the Laws and realities of the day meshed with the needs of the time to shape one man's life. I read the book a couple of times before I passed it on in the woodworking club. ([...])
3,It's not the rocking Coverdale I love,"David Coverdale (Whitesnake) still have a great voice, but the material on this release is not that exciting. I'm a big fan of Whitesnake but I must say that Coverdale was so much better and interesting in the past. I really miss the rockers, and I miss groove. I can admit that it's sometime beautiful but I wish that Coverdale would show a bit of hunger like he did on ""Ready an' willing"", ""Fool for your loving"" and ""Crying in the rain""."
1,Extremely disappointed,"No words could elaborate as to how poor this book is. Don't be fooled by the title like I did. It's simply a tool to promote the author's website (which is as poor as the book is).In general, the book has no inspiring color photos. Way too simple, common-sense, basic information even for an amateur. If you're looking to learn how to make AND market gel candles like wildfire.... this is simply NOT the book."
3,fast shipping,"fast shipping...But when I have a little problem, I called the seller, the representive said that I should called the manufacture for the problem. It is different that I bought directly from the amazon."
3,Not for Windows VISTA,Never had an issue with the unit.Simple and not a bad price for a GPS. I have seen some that will say out the road / street names you need to merge with.This unit notifies you with a 'prepare to exit on the left' 'keep to the left' and then a simple beep when you are right on the turn.My only real issue with this unit is that I can not download the updates as they have not updated their software for windows vista. So you'll need access to a windows XP computer to update your maps.
3,never lost,the unit works well for basics.like finding an address or gas station.little lacking in upgrade the maps on new roads and resturants.
2,"Magellan 3100 is slow, TomTom One Rocks","I had purchased Tom Tom One and later picked up Magellan 3100 and compared side by side.Tom Tom one is atleast 3-4 seconds faster in response to Magellan 3100 on highways ,the navigation on Tom Tom is so much better and intuitive than 3100.The screen is filled with info and can be selected/deselected with Tom Tom One and can switch to other information such as details of the route within 1-2 clicks on screen.Goodluck with 3100 driving within city . Kept Tomtom and returned 3100."
3,Just the basics,"This is my first GPS. It seems to be OK so far, but I need to do the estimated 11 hour update. There are many POI that are not showing (ie gas stations and resturants). The price was great, but I hope I didn't sacrafice information just to save some money."
4,Great value for the money,"The Magellan Maestro 3100 is a great starter for gps. It's maps are clear and navigates well on most major streets. The only problem I have encountered is with new streets ( 3 yrs or less ) not being updated in the system. Especially in a city like Dallas, where new roads and neighborhoods are constantly growing, I would have expected more updates, at least up to a year ago. Otherwise, for more established areas, this machine is really great. It lets you know when to get into the left or right lanes ahead of time before a highway splits. All in all I am extremely satisfied with my purchase."
2,Great.. until it stops working,"I bought this Magellan the day ofter Thanksgiving, it was super easy to set up and very user friendly. It got me where I needed to go with few problems. Unfortunately about 45 days later it stopped charging. I don't know if it was a problem with the unit itself or if the cable wasn't making a solid connection. Luckily I had purchased a two year warranty, not something I usually do, but thankfully this time I did. They were completely out of the Magellans, and so they offered me a Garmin Nuvi-hopefully it won't break after a month and a half. I'm sad my Magellan stopped working, it was more user friendly and the screen was bigger. Maybe I'll have better luck with my Garmin."
1,Magellan 3100,"DONT BUY MAGELLAN!Totally unreliable, died when I needed it during a trip in Florida. The Call support center has been outsourced to the Phillipines! I had to send the dead unit to Texas. They have had it for almost one month, cannot fix it and do not have a replacement to ship to me. So I continue to wait in limbo. Will never buy a Magellan again or recommend it to anyone."
5,Every Person Should Have One,This is a Christmas gift for my dad so I have not opened it yet. But I bought it based on recommendation so I am confident that it stands up to what it is supposed to be.
3,Magellan Maestro 3100,Product is good. I travel for work and it is quick and easy to use. Sometimes it does take a long time to change to my location from a previous one.
4,Works great,"Finally got to try the unit today, let it guide me to a new office building in another city. Did a fantastic jobI had backup Google maps just in case.I did the upgrade from the website almost immediately after receiving this as a gift. No problems with the upgrade, printed out and followed the directions.I didn't need bells and whistles, just a simple navigation unit and this works just fine."
1,Stay away from Magellan,"Buyer Beware! Good luck getting any reasonable customer service from these people. I purchase the 3000T less than one year ago and also subscribed to their Traffic Master service. After a few months, the Traffic Kit - which powers the unit and works as an antenna for the traffic service - stopped working. After repeated emails and phone calls, I can't get them to replace the unit (which they acknowledge is defective) nor will they cancel or suspend the subscription. The product is only as good as the service they put behind it. Stay away."
4,"Excellent encyclopedia of trees, shrubs and flowers","We purchased this book on buying a new home to search out trees, shrubs and flowers to include in our landscape design. As such, the book is excellent. I would not buy this book for plans and actual design patterns. The first chapters of the book give general introductions to gardening strategies; then beautiful and thorough plant identification. The ending chapters are on hardiness zones, plant care<eg, dividing perennial roots>. Makes a wonderful reference book. Highly recommend."
1,not good,viewing angle is terrible and there is a DOT ON THE SCREEN THAT IS VERY DISTRACTING. do not get this
4,Olevia LCD,Very happy with this product. The picture is wonderful. [...] Olevia sets up very easily and operation is easy too.
4,"Great TV , but I stlll have not received my $100.00 rebate","The TV was all that advertised - the price and color is great. However getting my $100.00 rebate, as promised, is a different story. My documentation was mailed as requested on December 2004, to date March 1, 2005 my rebate has not arrived. Please be aware! I would hate for Amazon to lose a customer due to this rebate issue. Because the 30 inch version was such a great buy, I had plan to buy the Syntax 20 inch lcd tv from Amazon, but because of the rebate problem I now have concerns."
5,Great buy for the mony,Great Tv not a lot of features but and excellent choice. I just found out that the Tv is Made By LG and Philips. and this one is cheaper than either brand. Only draw back is that when the Tv is off It has a light on the front of it that won't shut off and it is pretty bright in a dark room.
4,A forgotten swing bandleader,"One of my favorite swing cuts is Bobby Sherwood's ""Sherwood's Forest"". It was only when I got this disk that I remembered how good the rest of his band works really was.If you like '40's swing, Get this just to hear Sherwood's Forest. Then relax and enjoy the rest of this really good albumn."
2,Sherwoods Forest?,"What titles are contained in this CD? Is the coveted, collectors item ""Sherwoods Forest"" on this CD? If so, then the CD would rate 5 stars. Please supply the missing info!"
5,Five Stars are Not Enough,"Get this performance. It is chilling. Bruckner's Ninth boldly faces mortality, in all its terror, anger, and finally, resolution. And what better person, time, and place to explore these issues than Wilhelm Furtwangler, in Berlin, in October 1944. If ever there was an artist intricately familiar with his subject this is it. This performance was recorded in the Beethovenshal, soon to be obliterated in the waning days of the war. Furtwangler himself had found himself on the wrong side of Hitler, and about the time of this recording was receiving urgent warnings from Albert Speer to get out of Germany before it was too late (he eventually did three months later, to Switzerland).I have heard many performances of the Ninth, but none comes close to the intensity of the work of Furtwangler and the Berliner Philharmonic here. Get this CD. It may change your life."
2,"Read ""Elegance"" instead. Had to force myself to finish this one","Quite disappointed in this novel, as I really enjoyed author's first novel ""Elegance."" While the supporting characters in Innocence are likable, they are just caricatures. Reads like annoying stereotypes.I had to start skimming to move along in this story. And it is not as funny as Elegance.If you have picked up the hardcover of Innocence, you will notice all the praises are for Elegance, none for Innocence. So perhaps the professional reviewers didn't like the advanced copies of Innocence either?SPOILER: In the end she says she marries a musician. Uh huh. Why isn't it clear which one? Why am I doubting the author's intent? Tessaro, if you give it a happy Hollywood ending, why give it that I-will-not-spell-it-out-for-you British ending as well? Pick one!"
1,Embarassingly ignorant,"The Foreword of this book contains a lecture about how most Westerners are ignorant of Chinese culture, which I would agree with.Ironically however, the very first paragraph of the very first chapter makes the grand statement that China is the largest nation on earth, after only Russia and the USA. Clearly the author has never heard of a little place called ""Canada""!I can't fathom how a book could make it through several editions, only to make such an ignorant error in the very first sentence. If you're looking for a quality work of history, keep seeking."
5,Lady Di,"This is an amazing product! I started using when a manicurist recommended it while I was on vacation in San Francisco. My nails were peeling and always a problem. After using for two months, I have nails that are very hard and healthy, with no peeling. I use one coat, then a coat of a pale blush color (Sally Hansen Salon because I like the brush), then a top coat. The product dries quickly, but I always use drip-dry drops to help.Then the next day I put another top coat on, and thereafter every day if I get the opportunity, until the polish starts to peel off. It doesn't take much time to apply it, so about every 5-6 days I'm starting from scratch again. Every coat makes your nails really shiny again. My nails grow so well, that every other week I actually have to cut them, rather than just file them. I'm just so pleased with this product, and can't find it where I live, so order from Amazon, and I have it quickly."
5,"Finally, the Nail Polish That Worked!","For years, I looked for a product that would strenghen my weak, brittle, chipped nails and finally a friend told me about Duri Rejuvacote. My nails are so strong now that I sometimes have to cut them, as they get too long. I no longer need to visit a nail salon and pay for those artificial nails. I am never without this product. I love it!"
3,Trying to make ghetto out of everything!,"The theme: Ghetto is a mindset.The topics: sometimes funny, sometimes interesting, sometimes a bit redundant.I think Cora Daniels does a good job explaining elements of modern culture that glamourize that which wouldnt have been seen as glamorous in a different day in age (i.e. rap lyrics, love affairs, high priced materials on lease, etc.) But she also tries to put the ghetto stamp on practically everything (i.e. people who recite a rap phrase, bill clinton for having an affair, listening to your radio on loud). The credibility of her argument suffers from some of these disconnects between what is really ghetto and what is not.I would recommend you read this if you like reading essays on pop culture but please be warned: she will try and make you feel like everything modern is ghetto.And that in itself is kinda ghetto."
2,Grossly Disappointed,"I have been a fan of Sarah Harmer since I picked up her ""You Were Here"" CD in 2000. I was very excited when I learned this new album was coming, and very disappointed when I heard it. The Sarah I knew was not bluegrass and was not twangy. This CD is not rock. Its bluegrass. So, dont buy it, expecting it to be like her first two solo albums, cause it is not."
3,"Terrific idea, poor execution","I wanted to love this book because it uses the real book ""Elegance"" as part of the plot but it's just no use. The heroine is such a silly little girl that I want to smack her upside her head. None of the characters are likeable and plot falls into place a little too easily."
4,Nice writing + fresh plot = excellent chick lit,"The cover art first caught my eye - the '50's style font and magazine illustration style - that reminded me of an old book called Elegance that I've got stashed on my bookshelf, and that I occasionally page through for a grin. Paging through this book I realized that Tessaro's heroine uses that same book to guide her through a troubled time - is that life imitating art or vice versa?At any rate, I bought the book, read it, and Kathleen Tessaro immediately jumped onto my list of favorite authors. Her writing felt effortless, her plot felt fresh, characters interesting, and plenty of girlie details to satisfy anyone who, for better or worse, grew up on a diet of Elle and Vogue. Perfect for either a rainy day or a day at the pool - two thumbs up."
5,Enchanting book ~ clever storyline!,Hard to put down!!! Louise finds a book in a secondhand bookshop called Elegance by a stylish Madame. She puts the words to use and her life takes a turn. GREAT story!
3,Interesting...but,"Parts of this book are delightful, such as the excerpts from Madame Dariaux's book. The story itself skips along breezily and held my interest. However, the main character in the book, Louise, is appalling self-centered and began to grate on my nerves. Only once in the book does she think about or help others and even then it was in a self-serving manner. And, as other reviewers have noted, Louise does not act her age. She also supposedly has an eating disorder which is resolved in an incrediably unbelievable way. Good beach read, but don't expect much. The best ""character"" in the book is Madame Dariaux."
2,OK as a novel.,"To be honest, it was less than I expected. As being in my late thirties, I expected to learn more about elegance: more than how to dress. I think it would entirely depends on individual's taste, however this book may be for much younger people, say under 25. I personally even felt that this 32 year-old heroine, Louise was a little childish in her thoughts and behaviors."
3,Yaoi: Maker of Akward Situations Since its Inception,"The art is beautiful, the animation is basically nonexistent. If you're looking for a good story, don't get this. Interested in awkward conversation and cliche characters? Then this is the anime for you! Laughed when i should have been crying, covered my eyes when I should have been drooling over the boy love. It kind of sucked, but...I would probably buy it again... Crotch shots!"
3,Good--but not perfect--substitute for peanut butter,"I tried this product because I was looking for a healthier alternative to peanut butter. My main reason for choosing the low carb version over the regular version was that the former was also lower in fat. Although I found the taste of this product to be pleasant, it tastes nothing like peanut butter and is somewhat of an acquired taste. In addition, the lack of sugar results in a texture similar to natural peanut butter--ie, the oils separate, which necessitates stirring the product. I sometimes found that by the time I reached the bottom of the jar, the remaining product was dry and crumbly. Although this product is adequate if you are counting carbs, I prefer IM Healthy's regular Soy Nut Butter."
1,What a Disappointment,"I was eagerly anticipating this book. I have enjoyed Lindskold's past books and Egypt is always an interesting subject. Imagine my dismay when the book ends up being a dud. The characters were very superficial with little personality, it was difficult to sympathize/relate with any of them. And though the book is seemingly set in the late 19th/early 20th century there was glaringly obvious modern slang in many of the character's speech. And the plot, sigh, the plot started out with a decent premise but was bogged down with irrelevant side stories and a lack luster finale. I do not blame this on Ms. Lindskold, this is clearly the work, or lack thereof, on the part of her editors. A little pruning here and there, and some constructive criticism on their part and this could have been a great book. Unfortunately, as seems to happen all too often, the editor's apparently functioned as highly paid spellcheckers. Do yourself a favor and skip this book."
2,I hoped for better...,"I first found Lindskold through When the Gods are Silent, an excellent book. Then Donnerjack, her completion of one of Zelazny's unfinished works, was excellent as well. I read the first three of her wolf novels; very good. So I had high hopes for The Buried Pyramid. Unfortunately, the first eighty percent of the book struck me as childish without the childlike sense of wonder, and as leading to a great climax. Also unfortunately, the great climax was nothing but a radical change in form, the sudden appearance of great magics and jarringly useless gods, and epic adventures compressed into paragraphs. I'll go try the 4th of her wolf novels now."
2,I am so glad I never purchased the movie!,"If you have the choice between watching the old versions of the Twillight Zone and Uninvited Guest, watch the Twillight Zone. My eyebrow was arched in confusion the whole time... and all I could think was... ""This is Bull!"". The whole movie in theory was a big 'free-writing' assignment. The plot(s) had no rhyme or reason. Give me ""Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder"" anytime from the Twillight Zone instead of that ball of confusion!"
4,Low Budget? Didn't Notice.,"Phifer was real good in this. He was a bad guy that you loved, and laughed at cause he played it so good. If you like underground movies like this that didn't hit the big screen, and are better than the ones at the big screen sometimes, I suggest Lockdown as well.Buy this movie."
4,i liked it,"i really liked the end, i liked the movie. i just loved mekhi phifer. i think he could make any role interesting, but the subtitles drove me crazy!!!! but the first time i saw it was on vhs and i dont think it had subtitles but the dvd does. Please, make subtitles optional!!its hard to concentrate on a movie when they are there. over all i really like the movie. i thought the idea of it was good and the end had alot of twists. i wouldve given it 5 stars if not for those damn subtitles. i would say rent it first. i really like it, but its the type of movie you either love or hate, so before you invest the money to buy it rent it first.just incase you think its cheesy then you only spent $1 instead of $20 i rented it then i bought it. i can see how some reviewers could call it cheesy and you might agree wiith them but i liked it."
2,Ilustrations not too impressive,"I was very happy to find a childrens book about the Komodo Dragon! However, the illustrationa and the story itself was dissapointing. I give it the 2 stars for the subject matter, but I actually considered returning it."
5,best songwriter ever,"This album almost rivals Late for the Sky, and Sky Blue and Black, as a ballad of lost but enduring love is simply exquisite. It sets the ideal for love which Before the Deluge set for humanity. While every song on LFTS is a classic, not every cut here can stand on its own. Perfect nevertheless."
3,Webb,I was really looking for something from Jimmy Webb beyond his early stuff to enhance my collection - I found this just okay.
5,COMPLACIDO DE ESTE PRODUCTO,ESTOY MUY SASTIFECHO DE ESTE PRODUCTO ME SASTIFASE CORRECTAMENTE Y PROTEGE MUY BIEN LA COMPUTADORA.
3,Not as good as others...,"If you're looking for the good old Warren Miller films, this isn't quite it. This film is where Kurt, Warren's son, starts narrating most of the films, and he's really not very good at it, especially compared to Warren. The film itself is decent, but not nearly as fun and exciting to watch as Fifty, Storm, or Cold Fusion, (or any of the older, classic Warren Miller films.) In my opinion, this is one of the weaker films in the Warren Miller collection. The narrating is bland, monotone, and quite annoying, and so is most of the music. The skiing and boarding is pretty good, but, still not up to par with other Warren Miller films. If you're planning on buying some, skip this one."
5,so far so good,I'm about 4 weeks into using this treatment and already see a difference in my hair. It feels thicker & fuller!!
3,unsure about this product,I have used the product for almost a month and I don't see significant results yet. The instructions do state to use it for three months so I will use it the requested time to see if I do achieve results. Jury is still out on this one for me????
3,Too Early to Tell,"I have only used this products 2 times, so it is too early to tell if it will work or not."
2,Bad machine!,"I received this machine for Christmas, and thought I had a good machine. I knew nothing about sewing at the time, and thought this would be a good starter machine.I whipped out a few pillow cases, even tried to sew a quilt and a dress. My main issue was the needle kept unthreading, and it seemed I couldn't sew a straight line. I figured it was just lack of experience on my part, boy was I wrong!I'm really glad I decided to take a quilting class where I took this machine. I mentioned the problems and the experienced women there tried to help. They noticed the machine was pulling to the left, and did just about everything to try and fix it, but ultimately told me I had a bad sewing machine.Had I not gotten advice from someone who knew much more than I did, I would have been learning on a faulty machine, and who knows where that would have led me!Based on that, I can't recommend this machine to a beginner."
3,Brother sewing machine,"This sewing machine is easy to use for a beginner, but there are two main issues I have had so far. Firstly, the directions are a little bit confusing due to how they are worded and the four languages that are present throughout. Secondly, the thread gets caught on the wheel which unthreads the needle frequently. However, the sewing machine sews great and is easy to use once the directions are read thoroughly. I have never sewn before in my life, but with this sewing machine in the last two weeks I have made my first Halloween costume for my daughter. So, all in all, I am very happy with the machine."
4,Really is a basic machine,"first time ever sewing. never touch a sewing machine but the instructions/ picture helped a lot. aside from what everyone else said, there are different speeds ( at least in my experience). The bottom spool runs out fast which is a down side. You need to open it up more often to refill it.Overall very nice."
4,Nice Machine But Poor Instructions,"I received my machine and was very excited to get started. It took so many hours to work with the instructions supplied. It felt as though the instructions did not follow a sequence. Good thing I read very carefully and found out that the machine had to be oiled before use.Once you get past the instructions, the machine is a good value."
4,good for beginners,"I had never used a sewing machine before this one. I bought this one because of the price, features, and good reviews. The first time I used it, I was a little lost, but I read the manual and I got the hang of it. The instructions are a bit difficult to decipher at first, as there are numerous different languages printed next to eachother, it was hard to find the english in sequence. Other than that, this is a great sewing machine. I've used it many times since I bought it, and it seems to be working well. It's also lightweight, and stores easily."
5,Nice machine for the price.,"I had a little project to re-cover some foam cushions. Reviews on hand-held machines were awful and this one was just a little more expensive and a lot more versatile. I had not used a sewing machine in close to 50 years and as a man am not supposed to, but I decided to try. Easy to set up, the price is right, works well with no problems. Nice tight stitches with no adjustments. Did an excellent job on some medium-weight apholstery fabric. Directions on bobbin removal and filling were a bit obtuse but I got the job done."
1,worst instructions ever,"i can't stress how bad this instruction booklet is. i bought this machine with the hopes of being able to hem my own pants. well, there is a section on blind hem stitching. unfortunately, the instruction booklet does not tell you that you need a different presser foot than the standard one. and of course the machine doesn't come with it. it took a significant amount of time on google to figure out why i couldn't make my stitch look like the picture!!it is not the best machine for beginners.those of us just starting out with sewing need a better users manual."
3,Great machine for the price,"First I want to say this: this is a very beginner machine. If you want to learn to sew, this is great. It's very easy to understand. It's a good little machine. I had mine for almost 2 years before I upgraded to a janome and became a better sewist. I've had zero problems with mine. It's a bit noisy, and you need a mat under it, so it doesn't shake itself off the table. But other than that, i've had no complaints. Even though I have a great fancy new machine, I am keeping my cheapo little brother for a backup."
4,Sewing Genie,Excellent little machine. I have only used it for basic sewing of items such as curtains and throws and it performed very well indeed. The only quibble I have is the fiddlyness of the bobbin - winding on the thread doesn't always work properly and I devised my own method: and I found inserting the bobbin into the casing slightly awkward.However I got over these problems and as I said the machine did the basics I asked of it. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a no nonsense machine.
3,Not easy to use,I've been sewing for over 30 years - and this is the most difficult sewing machine to thread (keep threaded) I've used. Wished I hadn't ordered it...
2,Isn't taste that good,"These fruit snacks don't taste good. In addition, I bought pack of 60 and they sent me only 2 boxes of 20, thus 40 only. I'm not happy with dishonest service"
2,Taste like a pureed apple with some strawberry flavoring,"I can't believe how wonderful all the reviews were of this snack. I was expecting a strawberry chewy snack, but got an apple with some strawberry flavoring. Really this is not what you expect. It has a mushed up apple consistency. Neither my husband or I liked this product. Buy small quantities to make sure you approve, I have 58 of them left to stomach or give away."
5,WONDERFUL,"Over the summer, I camp pretty much all summer up in the Catskills. It gets pretty cold up in those elevations, especially when it's been raining for the past 2 weeks and NOTHING IS DRY. Your still warm in your wonderful mummy bag. I got my first one when I was 9 and it lasted me until this, and the only reason I had to get rid of it was because I forgot to air it out after a particularly wet trip. #_#;;"
4,Restick Disc Sandpaper does the trick,"I've always loved this invention. Makes sanding soooooo much faster. Tips for use:--Take time to center the paper on the sander face. You don't want to damage the rotating tool face; it'll never recover.--Always wear a mask (bet they sell them here!). The dust created is surprisingly bountiful.--Always mask off indoor areas and ventilate. (The dust gets EVERYWHERE.)--Consider wearing a hat, bandana or other headcovering for all that dust. Maybe long sleeves too. Your arms will get coated as well.--Finished sanding? **Always** remove the spent or partially spent sandpaper from the rotator immediately. Why? Because the adhesive is still warm and will easily peel up. Wait until it cools and you'll be scraping off with finger nails and blades, wrecking your rotator.Happy sanding!"
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"Horrible. 25% less screen space then a normal palm, but it's the same size. Yes the clock is cool, but face it, for about the same price you can get a Handspring Visor, with FULL functuality with a springboard slot!!!! The Palm feels good in the hand, but it ends their. Please trust me on this, Ibought a M100 and I uste my Visor way way way more. It's hard to read text, because it's so small! And for a clock I have a watch. And the faceplates are garbage. They just make the screen deeper set into the device. You will want a visor, or at least a Palm IIIe"
1,Not as Good as Handspring's Visor,"I tried the m100 and have to say I was disappointed. It has a very small plastic screen, flimsy, toy-like body and no expandability at all. It's also not Mac-compatible out of the box. I ended up getting Handspring's Visor Solo for the same price and am much happier (plus, it fixes all the problems mentioned above)."
2,"User Friendly, but too out of date.","This came in on the latter(and cheaper) end of the long line of excellent Palm products, and is a very easy to use, ergonimaclly friendly toy. Yes, I said toy because unfortunately it's just too out of date. You can now have as many features on your cellphone as this offers, and even at under $40 - buying something that has only 2MB of memory and is not upgradeable is simply a waste. No offence to Palm, I like their products, and have had several, but please wake up and smell the future! There are now a great many affordable PDA's out there that you can do so much more with, and products like this, however well made have just been left behind. For example, at still under $100 is the Hewlett Packard Jornada 525 Color Pocket PC - upgradeable and has ten times the power and functions. Save your money, and buy something more modern."
5,Couldn't Have Survived Freshman Year of College Without This,"I got this during my freshman year of college and am really glad that I did. It helped keep me organized and was cheap enough that it didn't break the bank. I could also play games before the professor/instructor came to class.Suggestions:I would definitely suggest getting a case for it, so you don't have to worry about the cover flipping open. I would also suggest getting a keyboard for it because you can type your notes out and sync them with your computer when you get home. Get an extra stylus, too. I lost mine a few times (always found it), but that what you will have one when you need it."
4,Good Product for the Price,"I upgraded from a broken Palm III, and throughly enjoy it's repacement the m100. It's screen, while small, is clear and crisp and visible in low light w/o a backlight. It is also faster than the palm III and includes a sketchpad for quick non-Graffiti notes. Another neat thing you can do w/ it is bring up a clock at the touch of a buttonThe only problems i had with it is the cheap feeling stylus, the recessed screen, and the cheap feeling flip cover.Basically, this is the best Palm OS organizer in price/performance ratio, just get a better stylus......"
4,M100 a great deal for great organization,"The M100 is a great PDA for the money. Just much of the same as a Palm Vx, and has some new features even the Palm Vx doesn't have (the little windo in the cover to see the clock). Easy to set up, easy to use, this little Palm is my new best friend. The only problem I had was that it froze up on my first hotsync, but doing fine now."
3,Review of Palm 100,"Although I have loved this Palm and all it's functions, it only lasted a year with I'd say average use. The screen has several dead spots (won't react when touched with stylus). I also was disappointed that it was unable to handle a simple program that a ""Handspring"" model that was several years older was able to accomadate. I would probably get another ""palm"", but perhaps NOT by this company or model. I do have to be fair, my husband has one of the same age and type. He has had no problems, but his is used considerably less."
4,great product,this product is one great organizer. its quick and fits right in the palm of your hand. if you are looking for an organizer that will keep your life straight look no further this is the palm for you! the only thing that held me back from giving this product 5 stars was the lack in accecories. you have palmpix and smartpad but no modem no mp3 and no expandable memory. if these things meen any value to you get the m505 but if not click buy now! im a mother of four and believe me when comes to keeping your life straight without giving an arm and a leg ive loved my m100.
2,Ugly,"Outdated 2MB junk pile. Very Ugly. Anylize this: A pink, gold, red, blue, leapard pal is UGLY. A faceplate that covers half the palm means it's HALF colored, HALF black and ALL ugly"
4,good size,"i got the m100 as a gift, and while i asked for something a little nicer, it works pretty fast, and all the programs are organized well. it is really light, and thin. overall its a good project and i would recommend it."
2,A trial PDA . . . Spend more money on a better one,"I bought my handheld about a year ago. It was a trial run to see if I would like the idea. I did! But . . . after just 8 months of owning it, I could not tap the screen. I had to email the company to find out how to fix it. Their solution was to do a soft reset once a week.Two months later I decided I wanted to enter data via the PC and print a calendar for my husband. The connection was bad everytime, it was the software. The software was in working order when I first bought it.For my time and effort it was not worth it. I am planning on buying another handheld but will invest more money and do a bit more research..."
1,From genius to ordinary,Isler's Clerical Errors is beyond good; the Bacon Fancier is a disappointment. Maybe the author was compelled to sell his rough sketches. A mistake. Maybe it wasn't meant to be published but the author was hard up.
2,Poor quality,"Some good track selections and undeniably cheap price which is why it gets the second star. However, the recordings are poorly done and sound like they've been lifted from someone's old collection on vinyl."
5,Great Value....Great Quality...Made in USA! BEAST!,"The Land Wave ramps came today and my 13 year old son opened the box. He first set them up in an ""A"" frame then connected them side by side. After about 20 minutes of hard skating I asked him, ""How are the new ramps?"" He said 3 words. BEAST! Thanks dad!We have a pair of the cheapies and they work OK. The quality and strength of the plastic of the Land Wave set is very impressive for the price.The fact that they lock together makes them even better. I read a review that complained that the ramps were hard to get apart. In my view, they are hard to get apart by design. The fit must be snug because they must be sturdy when connected. If they came apart easy, then they would come apart in use.Bottom Line: Do not hesitate to buy these. Worth every penny, and I got free shipping too! Enjoy!"
5,Light Up!,"This is an album with hilarious lyrics about that weed of wisdom.Aside from that, it has some of the greatest jazz musicians of its first few decades. Dig Art Tatum and Barney Bigard on ""Sweet Marijuana Brown""."
2,"Not a Text Book, Read information closer","Very deceitful! I got a study guide instead of a text book. It should say somewhere in the PRODUCT DESCRIPTION and not just in the PUBLISHING area (It says ""9 Workbook edition..."") that the paper back is not actually a text book but a Work Book, maybe that is why there is no image available for the paper back selection! Read all the information of the item before finalizing order."
5,Great Workout,I am an advanced exerciser and I really liked this workout. It is very basic but yet challenging. It hits all major trouble spots and works almost every muscle group. I like Jillians style and her no excuses attitude. Her workouts are tough depending on how much you put into it. The time seems to fly by with her circuit style workouts. Would recommend for all fitness levels.
4,Good workout,"This is a good workout for a 40 minute video. Hits all target areas and is great if you're crunched for time. I prefer a longer workout, but I like this option."
3,fun!,I actually first tried this workout video through net-flix AND loved it!!!! I ordered it because I felt like it was a really sweet investment.. the actual workouts are SO MUCH FUN... I always feel SO SORE the next day... i love to work out... video's dont normally float my boat: but LOVE this one!
4,Pretty Good Workout DVD,"I would give this workout 5 stars, except that it's not for a beginner, but there should be at least one or two premixes on this DVD for a beginner and it's not. But it has some unique moves I've never seen and it looks like a lot of fun to do. But I'm just getting back into the swing after a long relapse into lazyville, so I can't do the knee exercises at this time, but I don't doubt that I'll be back to my old powerhouse self within a couple of more months and rocking this workout! I recommend it for an intermediate or advanced level."
5,I'm a beginner and this is a challenge,"I'm using 2 pound weights and I can not do all the moves. But I've had this DVD for 3-4 weeks and I've improved. There are a few moves I've improved- meaning I can actually do them now and there are some I'm still working on. I couldn't even do one push-up from the knees, and now I can do a dozen. 'Surrender' I can now do but still without the weights, I can do 'supermans' now unlike before where I was like a weird blob humping the floor (trust me it did not look good).My husband sometimes does the DVD with me (which I think is the best way of support) with heavier weights and he sweats harder than me and he says he feels like he's done a really good workout (and he's fit, as in passes his military fitness tests easy).I like that I can continue to be challenged into the future with this DVD. Hopefully by the end of this year ill be able to do all the moves with 3 pound weights."
5,Perfect Title for the Workout,"I read great reviews and felt the greatness when I completed the workout. I loved the fact that she explains about each exercise the reason we are doing it, what we are working on and encourages through the screen. She has a legitimate smile and happiness, not camera shy to the point that the smile is plastered on. The routines are broken down into circuits which are 5 different moves repeated twice. They are not hard and yet you can make them more challenging or less, she lets you know how. I have earlier DVDs of hers and you can tell how much she has matured since then..."
4,Love!,"FAntastic DVD. Not as INTENSE as a Cardio work out, but it definitely works your muscles and challenges you to work really hard on your trouble zones. Its a good DVD"
3,Not for the faint of heart,This is my first Jillian workout and I'm thinking that I should have started a bit smaller. I have yet to be able to get through the entire workout. You'd have to be in way better shape than I am to get through this thing. And just so you know................. I have been working out consistently for 8 months and I have completed Tony Horton's Power 90 and p90x.That Jillian is one tough b**ch.
3,Disappointing,"Tried to do this DVD on the weekend after leaving it wrapped up for so long, however I found it to be very abs focused with a lot of exercises that you really needed to be fit and thin to do to begin with. I really didn't enjoy it and stopped doing it in the end."
5,Peaceful & Relaxing!,"If you're looking for a CD that you can wind down with at the end of a hectic day, this is *THE* CD to get! The whole album is extremely relaxing, peaceful, & enjoyable to listen to, not to mention thought-provoking at the same time. I'm so glad I bought this one, you'll not be disappointed."
5,Healing Angel: This is a very moving CD.,"The words are spoken, not sung, and the CD covers all aspects of life including birth, death, love, marriage, parents,parenting, and loss. It's very moving, and there is something for everyone to identify with. Roma Downey's accent absolutely makes this CD a must to own. I bought one for me, then 5 others for gifts. I highly recommend it."
5,A Centering Gift,"I bought this album for my mother, after hearing the first song on a friend's copy. I'm going to have to buy another copy for her, and for others I love, for I haven't parted with it yet, in the two weeks I've had it.When I get stressed out, or have just had too much of my busy world, I put this album on, and find that it brings me back to a place were I am at peace. It's especially great on the hour drive on the conjested freeway, to and from work!Roma's heartfelt voice and Phil's soothing music are better than Valium! They remind me of the spirit that dwells within, of the timeless place where all is well. They speak of the emotional drama that most of us go through, at different points in our life. And dispite the pain that we might feel in each drama, they remind us also of the beauty that is always there within, and available to guide us through.I'm looking forward to their next album!"
5,my sister Sandy,"My sister, Sandy, recently died of kidney cancer. My younger sister had this cd and brought it to the hospital. We played this cd over and over while my sister made her journey to heaven. It was such a calming experience with the cd playing and all the family there. Sandy had told us of a song that she wanted played at her funeral, but until that night we did not know it was the first song on the cd. God gave us such comfort that evening, and I thank my sister for bringing the cd. What an enterance my sister Sandy made in heaven. Love you Sandy. Thank you Roma for this beautiful and spiritual cd. SKBurch"
4,calming baby ::,"My 6 month old nephew was first introduced to this video when he was only a month old. It held his attention for the most part and so I concluded it was a good buy. But the other night when all attempts to put him to sleep failed my sister put on the cd that is included with the movie and he fell right to sleep. Nothing else has really been able to put him to sleep like that. Any video that puts a baby to sleep when the whole house is as tired and cranky as he is, get's two thumbs up from me.update: At ten months old he still goes to sleep with this cd."
5,Great new band!,"This is an amazing first effort from Faktion. I couldn't take it out of my CD player for weeks. Not only is the CD good, but they are a great bunch of guys who deserve your support and earn it with this CD... buy this CD! You won't regret it."
5,What an AMAZING album!,"There is not a single song on this album thats bad, they all rock! I see a BRIGHT future for this band, and longevity too! This CD is solid from start to finish and I highly recommend it to EVERYONE!"
4,"Awesome, but...","This product would be fantastic if the clamps would secure to the desk without a gap. Otherwise, an A+!"
2,Not What I Expected,"This product does what it says, but it is very light weight, and made entirely of plastic. The yoke wobbles around inside the base and the clips used to mount the yoke aren't stable at all. Don't expect a lot out of the CH Products flight sim yoke."
4,Worthy upgrade,"Upgrading from a joystick to this yoke made such a huge difference that I was smiling from ear to ear the first time I used it - it just feels so much more realistic.4 stars instead of 5 because the table clamps are too wide apart for clamping onto my 15mm thick Ikea desk. I stuck some rubber grips to the underside of the unit and that seems to have mostly solved the problem, although pulling too hard on the yoke occasionally dislodges it.(A handy tip: If you are sitting on a chair with wheels, and try to use this yoke, you will lose control.)"
1,Not even ok.,"I'm a pilot, and I'm giving up on this product. I've been trying to use it, calibrate it, get it to respond somewhat close to the way a real aircraft responds, and it just doesn't work. It is possible I'm doing something wrong, but it should not take several hours of trying to figure out the right way. I've reduced sensitivity to zero and it still won't respond realistically."
4,Great and real!!!,I use this the joy stick every day but there is one problem. It does not stand on it's own to make it drivable.
4,Not 100% happy!,"After easy hook-up (plugged into USB and my computer read product immediately - ready to use)however, after very few hours of use and with even less use of front button (red) on left handle of yoke, the button got sticky and would not come back up after being pressed. I'm in the process of returning the product(always a hassle)."
2,A poor choice for instrument work,"I purchased this and the CH Products rudder pedals to practice my instrument work. Other reviews mentioned that the control column does not return very well to a neutral position, with regard to pitch. Believe me, this is a major shortcoming of this product, and in IMC, you'll be searching all over for the correct control column position to control pitch. On the plus side, it does make you speed up your instrument scan, but it's a major pain. I tried flying a holding pattern today, and most of my attention was devoted to pitch and altitude. Even in the absence of wind and turbulence, the simulated plane flies like it's going through updrafts and downdrafts. Forget using elevator trim - the real issue is where do you have the control column positioned. I'm replacing this product. I wasted my money on it."
1,not for beginners,this is a horrable book for beinners very confusing doestn even cover 5 string bass poor instructions and details i definitly dotn reccomen this
5,Fabulous album. . .,"Hovering somewhere between goth and punk, and mixing in more than a little shattered carnival flavor, the Sex Gang Children create a distinctive sound that goes straight for the throat. This collection truly showcases them in all their glory. It has all the classics: ""The Quick Gas Gang,"" ""Barbarossa,"" ""Beasts,"" and more and more and more. The collection covers a decent timespan in the band's history and includes the crushing as well as the ethereal. You'll love it. It was so good to hear these songs again I had to hop around my house (I swear it)."
3,Donato Deodato,"Donato owed the label a session but was in a hurry to go back to Brazil.So Donato recorded a bunch of improvisations and told the producer to get Eumir Deodato to help with the arrangements for an album. Donato actually walked out on one of the initial recording session and called from a pay phone at the airport. Now we know where the inspiration for the tune "" Where's J.D "" came from, leaving Eumir being reduced to finishing the record. Later Joao was upset that the album was released as a collaboration, as it was supposed to be released as Joao Donato, with arrangements by Deodato. Deodato who never signed a contract, never got a penny for the album and so the lawyers for these two had it out resulting in later reissues being credited to Donato for the album and causing them not to speak again for many years. The music is quite good with the tunes "" Where's J.D "" and ""Capricorn"" sounding as if they were lifted off a Deodato recording from that era."
3,An odd and quirky assortment of entries,"I found this compendium of review and comment to be highly inconsistent in quality and analysis from entry to entry. Although I was glad to see that Annie Fellows Johnston's Little Colonel series was included, the series is not given its due as a contributing element to literary works for girls at the turn of the 1900s. Aileen Fisher and Kitty Barne also receive less coverage and analysis than they deserve. Ironically, there is a long section under ""n"" devoted to ""neglected works""! This is a higgledy-piggledy catchall section in a book that should devote more attention to many of the writers listed in that entry. A huge amount of ink is devoted to a long and rambling section called ""publishers and publishing""; another long segment is called ""information books."" Obviously no encyclopedia of children's literature can include everyone's favorite author or aspect of the field. This book, however, needs tightening and recasting in the next go-round."
2,Not that accessible,This book has a lot of information but not in a very accessible format. It is not easy to read or use.
4,Great Sales Force Automation Software,"Act is a very good ""Sales Force Automation Software"" this version is much better that the new one, is simplier and more easy to use, the new version tries to be so ""smart"" that it ends making all things more complicated."
4,Return to Midway,"This book is a very good read and is written exceptionally well. The historical information on the Battle of Midway is very easy to read, interesting and thought provocative. The author attempts, and succeeds, to involve the reader in the actual battle by introducing personal accounts from a number of American and Japanese veterans. The images within the book are very impressive and the artwork is very detailed and realistic. The discovery of the Yorktown is written concisely and the technical information is well described, yet not out of the understanding of any educated person. The only down side of the book is the poor renditions of tactical maps and lack of photographs of the actual Yorktown as it is today, despite the author noting that hundreds of images were taken. Well worth the effort to read this book."
1,Waste of time and money,"We purchased this shed based on price. They say ""you get what you pay for"" and that was certainly the truth with this product. Assembly was fairly easy, though the website was less than helpful on the details (for instance, the optional ""floor kit"" that we ordered turned out to be only a framing kit - we still had to buy plywood to cover the floor.).After one month of use, the door frame had buckled on one side, making it very difficult to open the door.When winter hit, we found the real problem - this is an uninsulated metal shed and we live in a fairly humid climate. The temperature differential between day and night was sufficient that we got huge amounts of condensation on the inner surface of the roof, which then dripped onto the things being stored. This is infuriating and annoying.I would recommend the purchase of just about anything other than this product."
4,"Pretty good, but....","I really liked the book, found the characters engaging (especially Aleksander's change from a complete jerk to a good but not wishy-washy guy at the end) The only thing that made me dislike the book was the romantic setup. There is very little interaction between Aleksander and Lydia, though you get the impression that they are fond of each other in a twisted sort of way. For Seyonne and Ysanne there is even less, and I felt that it was hastily thrown together at the end. All and all, I think the chemistry between Aleksander and Seyonne would have been far more intresting and I am disappointed that Carol Berg basically dropped that in the last few pages for a 'straighter' ending."
5,"EPIC (in all caps, that's right)","This book knocked me off my feet. It's heavy, it's rich, it's EPIC.And it's only the FIRST book in the series.The imagination behind this book is beautiful. And while I generally don't go in for extensive descriptions, my attention was definitely held by her words. The characters are deep and believable. I have not been able to attach myself to another of her series the way I have with this one, but this gets a full recommendation from me."
2,average,I was hyped about them coming back after they rocked on DJ Quik's Rhythmalism.that album was slammin'but this disc is about 5 years past the pull date on style.Up 'N Da CLub is tight.straight up DJ Quik is a Musical Genius.but he can't pull this disc off Properly.AMG is banging on the track but overall it's missing something.
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed by my first visit to the Pennyfoot. This is 12th in the series and the author must be ready to ""get rid"" of the characters and it shows. The plot is rushed and contrived and the characters were stereotypes one and all. Perhaps if I had been following the series through several books I would have felt differently. Recommend not purchasing, instead borrow from library."
4,An Excellent Resource for Students of Revenge Tragedy,"Mercer's book is an excellent resource for not only Hamlet, but The Spanish Tragedy (Kyd), Antonio's Revenge (Marston) and The Revenger's Tragedy (Tourneur/Middleton?). Critical for anyone researching these plays."
5,6 + Years of use and still going strong,One of my biggest complaints about the kettle grill was not being able to do a rotisserie bird. Then I discovered this accessory. I love it and use it several times every summer and once in a while in winter. Not sure what up with the one star review from one writer claiming it was too difficult. There are 6 pieces - look at the picture - this is not rocket science. One caveat - make sure you use a drip pan with some water in it. If you love real charcoal grilling and rotisserie you will love this.
5,love it,This is a quality product. if you are a serious bbq'er like me you will appreciate this product. the spacer and the rotisserie is very good quality and like everything made by weber should last a long time.
3,"Great toy, but contains low-quality parts","This is a blast to use and does an excellent job of hiding my lack of experience with a charcoal grill. Meats and chicken (brined) can be slightly overcooked, yet still remain moist. My only complaint is regarding the skewer and forks: rust was visible on these items after being used just once. For a product bearing the Weber name, such a disregard for quality is surprising. Weber should charge an extra $5-10 and use good metal for these items."
4,True to the soul!,"This is a real reflection, I feel, on Gary's life this past year. This is a realistic and honest reflestion of himself. Even though I'm a person who likes more variety in albums, I feel that it is not an issue here. His goal was not to put out more croud-pleasers, instead, it was to creat a true and real account of life put into music. What a wonderful reflection of God's love!"
5,"Just perfect, enough said","The second part of Death Note is perfect (and of course the first part is) I have yet to see L's movie though. Let me warn you, you will want to get both parts at the same time, because you will want to know what happens next."
4,Perfect Pocket-sized Copenhagen,"This was perfect ! This being my very first time in Copenhagen, the map was just the right size, showed all the famous landmarks, along with restaurants with brief reviews, and of course not forgetting a detailed street map of the city, which I will admit, I got lost once, but this map showed me exactly where I was and not only how to get back on course, but also what was along the way, with info about the places and things I was seeing. For this price, I strongly recommend it to anyone ! Perfect price, and perfect size - it didn't make me look like a tourist carrying a huge fold-out map, precise, and concise."
2,Bummer,"I, too, was incredibly disappointed by this follow up to one of my favorite books, ""A Ring of Endless Light."" Vicky, who grew so much in AROEL, was appalling in this novel. I adore Madeleine L'Engle's work and hate to have to critcize her, but I feel she failed the character of Vicky. On the up side, there's always one's imagination, and Ms. L'Engle has certainly provided many wonderful characters and stories for her readers to continue to think about. Just don't count on this story for much help."
3,Interesting Psychological Study,"The TV Kid uses discussion of tv-watching and other lonely activities (including housebreaking and falling asleep in someone else's bed!) to indicate the difficulties of not having the ideal American Dream family and home. Our hero has to learn to appreciate what he has and who he is. And he does. But he apparently has to get bitten by a snake first. Not a brilliantly constructed narrative, but a good case study of the complexities of today's families."
4,Interesting Read,I purchased this book for my 10 year old son to read for his Summer Reading Program. He stated that he could partially relate to the character and that he found it to be funny and taxing at times. He stated that he could not believe that you can just be enthralled by one aspect of something when there is so much to do.
3,THE STORY OF SECRET AGENT MAXWELL BOND,"Hopelessly dated, Dean Martin's foray into spy satire is often funny. A cool car that seems to bend around corners, odd gadgets like a bed that dumps the occupants into a pool, Vodka dispenser, reverse gun, beautiful women, corny dialougue, etc, do make this parody an amusing ride in a MAD MAGAZINE kind of way."
3,Let's not forget chrome-dome,"The villainous henchman with the black chrome-plated head was a formidable nemesis. And how about near the end when Karl Malden shot his own mistress with the harpoon. You could feel the air hissing through her lips as she fell dead to the floor. Dean Martin was always cool and any movie with a vivacious, young Ann Margret is worth watching."
1,not much blood,"This is the most boring book I have ever read, it is all genealogy and no blood. This is just a dark ages who's who of Northumbia. The author takes the reader down some really bizarre blind alleys that are in no way connected to the subject of the book. In the conclusion of the book I am left with the feeling that this is an extremely flimsy case for a blood feud that lasted over sixty years"
1,Do not waste your time!,"I loved Zombi 2, but I think the director, Lucio Fulchi, was desperate for the $$ when he decided to direct this sequel. This DVD will cause you to loose a million brain cells if you buy this OR watch this movie."
2,sublime might be a litle strong ... But good,The songs are interesting and fun and for those of you that do not know who AMMA is She is a saint from India and well worth singing about for sure ... but I was left wishing a little more thought had been put into the songs ... NICE start but really needs a few more words in the lyrics eh? Nice sound and voice though and still all in all really good to see some music that is differnt from all the rest!!Well worth a listen for sure!!
4,Great product with great results,"Klima Cleaner has the usual Einszett quality, so if you're familiar with them, you can be assured your results will be great.Easy to use, fast and simple. All that is necessary is that you follow the directions, and you'll get rid of the nasty odors that you get from time to time from your A/C. I'm in Arizona, so we get a nasty mildew-like odor from some of the microbial fungi and stuff out here, that even the Würth A/C deodorizer can't completely eliminate.After using, you'll have a pleasant lemon-scent in your A/C, but it's not objectionable. The scent will fade after a day or so, but you will NOT have the odor that you wanted to eliminate!Do not expect this, or any other product to permanently eliminate A/C odors. What you can expect from this item is a fast, easy, and effective solution."
2,It worked for a week,Once the car sat out in the sun. The smell came right back. I used the whole can and sprayed it directly at the coil from a sensor hole.
5,Angels Around Us helps to open eyes,"While angel books are all around us, its not easy finding a source that truthfully exbounds on what Scripture has said about Angels, both the glorious and the fallen. Where as other books seem to introduce the reader to fluffy winged babies, Connelly scours the source of truth ...the 250 times the word Angel is found in the Bible, over half of the biblical books...34 outta 66 are disected and then wrote in a very blunt, easy to read style."
3,My car makes me feel funny,"Sometimes, especially at night time, my car makes me feel funny. I never had the chicken pox, ever.Smash cellblock H. Thank you."
5,Superior Blood Pressure Monitor,"We had previously purchased a similarly priced product (different brand) which consistently gave error messages and low readings. We took the prior machine to the Doctor's office to discover that it provides readings that are substantially lower than the Doctor's equipment. This Panasonic almost never gives error messages and more importantly when taken to the Doctor's office, reads very close to the Doctor's equipment reading. The Doctor was very impressed with its accuracy and operation. We would strongly recommend this product."
2,panasonic ew3122s,"you can""t a good or precise reading with this unit. But you can get an close reading,to have an idea what is your blood pressure."
5,Easy to use,After researching numerous monitors I chose this one after reading the reviews and I am very happy with my purchase. Took the blood pressure monitor to my doctor to check the accuracy and I was pleased it was.
2,Bad switches on lights,"I purchased this product through Amazon a couple of years ago. If you rarely turn it on or off, it might be fine. I've had no end of trouble with the switches on it. The silver caps won't stay on, the switches seem to bind up. and now I am having to use a rubber pad to turn the bottom one on. I wouldn't buy another one."
2,You are better off with Sinister's earlier releases,"I'd much rather given this album 2 1/2 stars, but thats not an option. A mediocre CD from a band that I once loved. An Over-produced sound with standard death metal riffs and blast beats. Unless you are a die-hard Sinister fan, there really is no need to pick this up. Check out Cross The Styx, Diabolical Summoning or Hate instead and you will not be disapointed."
4,Great to finally have this on CD!,"This recording seemed to take forever to get to cd, but it's sure welcome. It's the only ManTran recording (to my knowledge) with ""Snootie Little Cutie"" and ""15 Minute Intermission"". (""Well Well Well"" finally found its way to another later recording).The only downside is the recording quality, but to a true fan, this isn't an obstacle. This is a definite must have for a ManTran Fan!"
3,3 stars,After receiving this video I was very excited to get started.. It has good workout exercises but I can't hardly watch the video anymore because the girl on the video is a little bit annoying..
2,Not worth it,"The exercises in the video are good--they are definitely effective and you will be sore after your first attempt. However, the DVD is terrible. You can't skip directly to the exercises without having to fast forward through the other common sense junk. There aren't many tips on how to do the excersizes correctly, which is essential in doing an effective workout with out hurting yourself. (I must have been doing something wrong because I strained my knees.) Also, Kim is annoying--her form of encouragment to keep going is a series of ""wow's"" in a very bimbo tone of voice. Obnoxious. Don't pay more than $5.00 for this program, it's not worth anything more than that."
1,Not impressed,"The editing on the dvd is messed up so you have to watch all parts everytime you do you exercise, you can't just skip to the exercises. This alone makes this product useless."
5,works well quickly,we did a quick fix on our ceiling and it has held through high humidity and freezing temperatures.
1,Permatex is not for me!,"First thing I would like say is I have helped replace a couple of headliners ten or twelve years ago when I worked at a shop. So I am familiar with the process but no professional. I took headliner out of 2000 Pontiac Bonneville, clean the fiberglass board, wire brushed it and cleaned it with paint thinner. A week later vacuumed the board and laid out the foam backed liner. After spaying the board and back of liner I let it tack one side at time. The stuff stuck really nice I had one small wrinkle and tried to fix it and there was no way it was coming up without ripping the foam. I used a can and a half on the liner and board. But, after install a month later I came out to the car and the front is sagging. You can still push it back and it sticks but falls back down after a day. This could have been my mistake as others have had luck or just a bad can glue. Either way I'm not using it again."
5,Musically and lyrically Brilliant !!!,"Motley Crue Featuring John Corabi is the hardest, most balanced and compelling disc from the Motley catalog. Hard rock from beginning to end. Corabi's songwriting skills compliment Nikki Sixx's well. Tommy Lee's drums explode with power and Mick Mars steps into the spotlight and shreds like never before. If you haven't heard this disc you might be saying ""What ?"" but for those that have it I need not explain further..."
4,just plain funny,"If you are a science fiction fan (and I guess you would be if you are interested in this product) this thing is an absolute HOOT! Not only does it send up Star Trek and Star Wars, but there are lots of cameos from several other sci-fi favorites. If you want something similar, check out Star Wreck Zone. It also pulls back the curtain and reveals that the mighty OZ might just be wearing second-hand shoes."
5,get it,This is a great book as the Basic japanese grammar. it's well organized like an encyclopedia. having this book and the one before will cover most often used japanese grammars. one of the best grammar out there. very concise and useful for those who are serious about being fluent in japanese. no other book have i come across that is as easy to use and understand as this book. this book is like the bible of japanese grammar. Also get the Basic japanese grammar. it will give you a very strong foundation which is a must for those who love the japanese language.
5,A fantastic reference book,"Everytime I am confused about an element of Japanese grammar I consult this reference book and I always walk away satisfied with all my questions answered. The translations are fantastic, the example sentences are chosen to clearly demonstrate the grammar point, and different usages are explained. What I like most is that this book takes varying English translations of the grammar point and shows how they are conceptually connected, so that you only have to remember the one grammar point rather than memorizing a bunch of seemingly different English translations.I hope to be a Japanese teacher in the future, and I'll be keeping this book by my side at all times."
4,Good first scanner,"This is my first scanner, so I can't do good comparisons.It has a good sensitivity: terrain here is not flat and I'm surrounded by high buildings and cell phone towers, but I can hear Talkabout transmissions several miles, mountains and buildings away. It is also good for aircraft communications, I can hear a tower located 30 km (~20 miles) away. The remote control feature is great, I did some interesting things using it.Negative points:* no alpha tags (and so many frequencies to remember);* audible 60 Hz noise;* telescopic antenna connector with a poor design;* there is an annoying beep when it is turned on and* the remote control feature requires RS232, I had to buy a USB/RS232 adapter."
1,don't waste your money--not the full length ballet!,"Beware! it's a "" documentary "" and not the ballet itself.There are just talking and talking and talking and...... with maybe a few minutes of dancing. There is nothing about Nureyev either. If you want a full length Romeo and Juliet, shop around. Maybe the ABT at La Scala with Angel Corella and Ferri."
2,let down,"1st off, i love josh. dressed up like nebraska is one of my favourite records. i ddnt like this one very much. whoever he collaborated with, i wish he'd stayed by himself instead. 2 of the songs on the record caught me, but the rest i didnt like. hopefully when the new record comes out, it will be better."
3,rockhouse rocks....sadly breck alan doesnt,ok i love rockhouse.....ive learned how to play every instrument thru there dvds and honestly out of any dvd company theres actually work helping out making me a better musician......... but sadly breck alan blows........ now i do pop inn the dvd once in a while still yes....i do practice the warm ups and i do still train with it .......why.......cuz im hoping im wrong and magically i get better..... which i do ......i practice allot but i dont see it coming from this dvd ...... if you can sing now and you practice everyday your on the right track ........ if you need help beginging to sing this dvd is for you ........if you can sing but need help warming up or practicing this dvd is for you ...... if you have got a voice and practice on your own and want to advance sorry search elsewhere........or buy this dvd maybe im wrong and it will help you .... either way they need a different instructor .....hes boring ...
1,Doesn't stick to leather/fabric AT ALL - don't waste your $$$.,"Useless. This was suggested to me to prevent my cat from scratching my leather chair, and it doesn't stick at all. If I even lightly touch it, it sticks to my finger and falls off the chair. Now I remember trying this on a fabric chair 4-5 years ago to keep my kitten from scratching and I remember it didn't work on fabric either. Useless stuff, don't waste your money - find another solution. In the meantime I have the vacuum cleaner against the corner of the chair she likes to scratch... that works better than this."
2,Doesn't stick on fabric...,I bought this product because my big cat loves to sit on the back of my sofa by the window. She flattens the pillow so much that it's hard to fluff it up again (the pillows are attached to the sofa). So I tried to adhere the strips all along the back of the upholstered sofa and it did not stick. I got more strips on me than the furniture. Finally when I got one to stick it came off on my cat's paw and she went flying around the room like she was on fire. She now enjoys a wonderful view of the yard on my unfluffy hairy sofa.
4,great buy!,"i love bracelets, and this has been perfect for keeping them organized and easy to get to. it's not the highest quality in looks, but it is ok. and it's functional and a good price, and i keep it on a shelf in the closet anyway :)"
2,eh...okay,"I was expecting something a little bit different when I purchased the underwear. The underwear is kind of tight even in the bigger sizes. I guess if I was smaller it would fit better, but overall, the comfort was not all that great."
1,oh well.....,"Another over hyped piece of..... jeeze can't anyone .. i mean any freaking body make something that is listenable. Speechless. The words I want to say about this are unmentionable. Jeeze man..tired, repetitive. This blows like Kenny G. I guess there is a sucker born every second and anyone who thinks this is phat... look at a lollipop .. it's mirror. Crappy rappy crap."
1,Boring unlyrical beat waster,Rick ross is the type of guy that you will listen to and your cerebellum will write you a dear john letter. The ignorant jargon that he spits makes my IQ sink right along with each bar that he spits. Rick further shows the world that nobody of substance can rap coming out of miami by the company he keeps on the album. The beats are hot on this album but they are horribly wasted by rick ross. I would not recommend this album at all. I am surpised this clown didn't do a duet with khia or trina. But then again all the mindless zombies would've thought that was hot. LOL.
2,Biting what's currently hot........,"Hmmmm....a Miami guy saying ""I'm a Boss"" in a Texas accent biting off Slim Thug, the real boss. Hmmmm....calling your click ""Triple C Mafia"".....sounds kind of like Triple 6 Mafia. Hmmmm.....your name is Rick Ross....sounds kind of like the old school producer Rick Rock. Hmmmm......rappin with the same voice and same subject matter (pushin coke) as another artist, Young Jeezy. This is a perfect example of what you call a cookie cutter MC. I give this guy another year before he drops off the map. I gave two stars because at least the beats on this album are super hot. It's just a shame a cookie cutter MC had to rhyme over them."
1,Don't let Rick Hu$tle you out of your money,"Please do not waste your money on this CD. The entire CD is nothing that we have not heard a million times ""I use to be a drug kingpin, I got money, I've got bling bling, don't mess with me or I'll kill you, my childhhood was hard, so I had to sell cocaine to make it, I've got a different girl for everyday of the week-b/c I sold coacine, hey!!!! Look I've got $5,0000 to waste on 26"" chrome spinning wheels, b/c I had one hot song on my CD that tricked everyone into thinking my whole CD would be hot."" If you're some big time dope dealer then this is the CD for you, b/c the whole thing is just a about selling cocaine & how great your life is when you sell drugs."
4,Pust It to the Limit,"1. Intro - n/a2. Push It - 10/10 classic song3. Blow - 8.5/10 good song4. Hustlin - 10/10 street anthem5. Cross That Line - 10/10 akon makes nuthing but hood hits6. I'm Bad - 8.5/10 good song7. Boss - 9/10 good song8. For Da Low - 9/10 good song9. Where My Money - 9/10 good song10. Get Away - 6.5/10 only week song11. Hit U From The Back - 8.5/10 good song12. White House - 9/1013. Pots and Pans - 10/10 classic song14. it's my time - 8/1015. Street Life - 9/1016. Hustlin Remix - 12/10 self explanatory17. It aint a problem - 8/1018. I'm A G - 9/1019. Prayer 10/10overall the album is good. hit u from the back, get away, its my time left off could have been better."
5,Grape is good,"I'm not one to like tart fruits and this is one of the only Kettle Valley fruit bar flavors I like. It is much milder than some of the other flavors. My kids like this one also, even though I don't, they love most of the other flavors as well."
2,He was convicted again.,"This non-fiction book, written by a convicted murderer, claims that he was innocent, framed for the crime, and wrongully convicted by a corrupt justice system. The story concludes with a judge ordering his release and a new trial. The book ends there. However, I did some research in the legal databases (Westlaw), and discovered that after the book was published, he was convicted at his new trial, and the additional evidence and testimony at the new trial seemed to confirm that he did, in fact, commit the crime. His conviction was affirmed on appeal."
3,A good book....but..........,This is a good book; written seriously by competent writers. The book contains lots of stories about people recalling past lives under hypnosis. The only negative point in this book is that the authors often give the impression to be so skeptical about the results of the experiences they write about that one may wonder: Why am I reading this book? Despite this; I consider it as a book which deserve to be read.
1,Replacment Band for this model does not match.,"Great Watch, but lousy Band. The band only lasted 5 months, and the replacement band has a sunken design as opposed to a raised design where the pins attach, causing a open space groove with the old style Triathlon 30-lap Watches. I was unable to get the new band to attached to my watch do to curvature of the pin, resulting in frustration.The newer Ironman triathlon 30-lap watch has been redesigned resulting in the new band, even though the older watches are still being sold. Over all, I will avoid buying a Timex as result of a lack of replacement parts."
5,Very very satisfied,"Have had these for well over a month and I am very satisfied with the build and quality, not to mention the looks.The initial chafing problems from the toe cap that I experienced in the first week has disappeared, and the boots are now very very comfortable to walk with."
5,Great Movie and under appreciated!,"This is an excellent movie - very good acting, clever concept, good story and way under appreciated by the general public. Give it a shot and you shouldn't be disappointed!"
2,Move on to the next movie,"Pretty boring. The main character can see two minutes into the future, which is apparently farther than the screenwriter could. Cheesy special effects."
3,Needed more...,It is an okay movie but leaves too many details out for it to be a great movie. They give you a twist at the end and so it is a satisfying ending but still if they had given more details or more depth to the characters then it would have been a better movie. Not really a family movie because there is a bit of violence.A magic act for one magician turns into a full scale search for a terrorist team really to end the world as we know it!
1,about as good as Cage's dye job,"#1 Cage's dye job was more distracting then the bad acting. Then again, maybe that's a good thing because it took my focus off the movie itself.#2 Cage is way too old to be playing alongside such a yougner actress. Their relationship was really unbelievable and ridiculous.This isn't one of Cage's better movies and not worth the price to rent or buy. I was so disappointed by thsi movie I actually feel the need to leave a review to save other unsuspecting victims."
2,Bad Dialogue,This movie had potential but the wooden dialogue gave the actors little to nothing to work with.
3,Something akin to deja vu,"Las Vegas showroom magician Cris Johnson has a secret which is a gift: he can see a few minutes into the future. Sick of the examinations he underwent as a child and the interest of the government and medical establishment in his power, he lies low under an assumed name in Vegas, performing cheap tricks and living off small-time gambling ""winnings."" But when a terrorist group threatens to detonate a nuclear device in Los Angeles, government agent Callie Ferris must use all her wiles to capture Cris and convince him to help her stop the cataclysm."
1,Poor Philip,"This movie isn't even out yet and already I'm sick. I am a big fan of Philip K Dick, I've read almost everything that has been published, and I cannot believe what people do to his work. The only ""adaptation"" that was of any value was ""A Scanner Darkly"", and I don't understand why it was made into animation. It did nothing for the story. Now we have another story ""based on"" a PKD story that has nothing to do with the original. If you want to know what this story is about, read ""The Golden Man"", and forget the movie. In fact I recommend the short story collection entitled ""Second Variety"" by Citadel Press. While you are at it, read Dick's comments on the story ""The Golden Man"" in the Notes at the back. It is a better use of your time than going to see the evisceration of another one of his excellent stories. I wonder where Dante would put the ""writer"" who adapted this one?"
4,"""The Matrix"" meets ""Groundhog Day""","This is a good action film with a tight cast (Nick Cage, Jessica Biel, Julianne Moore), a creative story line, and amazing visual effects. Cris Johnson can see two minutes into the future - his future - so the events that touch his life in this movie are so perfectly orchestrated that they are almost hysterical.However, the government wants him to find a missing nuclear warhead, and they will do anything to elicit his cooperation. But the bad guys know about him, too. There are many plot twists and thoughtful moments. The ending is a bit abrupt, but once you catch your breath, the light bulb lights - or may take a while to go off - but it's a satisfying film overall."
2,Move on to the NEXT Movie Please!,"NEXT had all the ingredients of a good idea, but was poorly executed by it's screenwriters and its actors. I really liked this concept, but was quickly bored to death after about 30 minutes.When you find yourself yawning and fast-forwarding your DVD, that's not a good thing.Plus, the bomb that this was at the Box Office should have raised a big red flag. But despite that, sometimes we moviegoers don't find all the hidden gems until later in movies.This ain't one of them."
3,Not bad,I want every thing on Blu Ray & after watching BR discs DVD just dont cut it the movie how ever not bad 4 for movie 2 for quality
4,2nd Graders Review,"first,The nurses skeleton is lost. Second, Every class finds a picture. Last they find the skeleton in a closet. I would recommend this Book to you if you like mysteries."
3,A to Z Mysteries - The School Skeleton,I like this book because it was a mystery and it was fun to try to solve it. You would like it if you like mysteries. Have fun reading. I hope you like it.
1,Junk item,I got sent the wrong cables. I ordered two 12 FT Digital Audio Optical TOSLink Cable Optic 12ft by Total Signal at $7.21 each. Instead I received two eForCity Digital Audio Optical TOSLink Cable Optic 12 feet priced elsewhere on Amazon at $1.58 each. These cables were clearly inferior compared to the ones I ordered with a very thin jacket and no locking mechanism so they fall out immediately. I needed these cables in a hurry so I could bury them in the wall on which I was hanging a flat screen TV. Instead I had to spend $80 at a local RadioShack for two cables similar to the ones which I should have received. To Amazon's credit I did receive a refund but I didn't need the hassle.
4,So Much FUN!,"Okay so its not a pro model, but wow I have had so much fun learning how to play on this little guy. I mean c'mon, there aren't that many instruments that you can get even a learner's model for the price of this one. Even if you hate it you're only out 60 bucks. It has a much darker body than the picture shows and it is really pretty. I didn't replace the strings yet but I have a feeling that if I did, it would improve the sound some. Everyone who's messed around with it can't help but get a smile on their face including myself. Its a really enjoyable instrument cause its pretty easy to pick up. Have fun!"
1,Philips PCRW804K17,"This thing is a piece of junk. It worked OK for about a year, only ruining 5 or 6 CDRs. Then one day it started opening and closing on its own, almost constantly, every time my computer was on. It's like it was sticking its tongue out at me! It hangs up every time I try to burn a CD now.I called Philips tech support, but they told me it would cost me ($) to talk to them, since it was out of warranty, and they couldn't guarantee the expensive conversation would solve my problem. Then they referred me to their cryptic website, where I could supposedly get free tech support. I have emailed them with my problems, but no one from Philips has contacted me. They probably know they have a lemon on their hands, and are scared of all the angry customers. Seeing all the bad reviews on this site just confirms that."
1,AVOID this one!,"I ordered this version of Phantom for 2 reasons: 1. it was inexpensive 2. the listing said ""soundtrack"" so I hoped it would taken from at least the national touring company if not Broadway. When I received it, it lists only ""C.C. Productions"" for credits. No vocalists, no orchestra, no other information! And the music and the vocals are both just terrible! I have seen ""Phantom"" live on Broadway at the Majestic twice and listened to the REAL soundtrack (which unfortunately I don't own but will purchase now!) and this is barely even recognizable. Retailers should be ashamed to even stock this poor version of ""Phantom""."
4,"It was very good, but I like the origional better.","The past artist, I can't recall waht the name was that preformed this song was much better I think only because I think that when something comes out good, it should be left alone. Sort of like the time when Juice Neuton (sp?) did a cover of a Janus Joplin song, I don't think that it is right at all, even if they do have legal permission! I beleive in presorvation not restoration! That includes music."
1,SHE CANT SING THIS SONG,"This is a beautiful song and was sang beautifully by Brenda K. Starr. Mariah sounds like her voice is straining or she has strep throat or something. She can't hit the notes. That ""breathy"" singing style she has isn't working here. The song sounds 10 times better by Brenda K. Starr. Mariah's version sounds like s**t. She should have left this song alone. Also, to those of you who think she is beautiful...get some glasses or a corneal transplant. She's thick waisted with scrawny legs, a flat ass, no hips, a big ass nose and no lips. She looks like the horse in her ""Butterfly"" video."
2,Mariah's latest,"I really used to like Mariah's songs in the early 90's but the songs she does now have no impact at all. They are all the SAME. They fall on your nerves. In the video of ""I still believe"" she tries to be so sexy but you don't get sexy if you try so hard. This all seems to be so artificial and superficial. Her voice is also not nice anymore, it's a screaming around (maybe she should drink more tea)."
5,To the Musiz fan from Manhattan which has commented ! !,"Hi ! I just wondering what the HELL you think you are to commented that Mariah can't sing "" I still believe"" sent by 18May99. She sang it so buatifully and this is the fact that you MUST accept. How could you criticize her on such a way that suggested people to wear glasses. I think the one need the glasses is not other people. IS YOU ! ! Obviously you are jealous. But that is okay and forgivable. As you must be very ugly........."
1,"Good concept, but it's just a disappointment","The scanner has to be perfectly lined up with two tiny triangles and on a flat hard surface to work (according to the instructions). What little kid can do that??? We are very disappointed, and our son get very frustrated that the scanner does not announce the correct items. In my opinion, this toy is really a piece of junk."
1,not worth it,"This was a bad purchase, it is all scratched up it looks used and most of all when it scans the items half of the time it doesnt and if it does it says another item than what you scanned. My son used it a few times and got mad at it and has not used it again. The worst $[...] I ever spent."
3,"Annoyingly loud, but my child enjoys it.","My four year old son wanted this for Christmas, it looks like it is for girls only, but I got it anyway. I think it has been somewhat helpful in teaching him about how purchases work and some math. It comes with a lot of pieces, with nowhere to store them when not in use, so we keep them in a ziploc which is not ideal. The crown is strangely small, I do not know who it is suppose to fit. Also, the area where you are suppose to sign for a Swiper card purchase is useless, you cannot see your name at all. But the scanner is fun.My son has been playing with it anyway on occasion, I just wish there was a volume control!!!"
5,"10,000 Maniacs Unplugged","Natalie Merchant's woodsy vocals shine brilliantly on this showcase CD. Her luxurious, eccentric delivery is at its peak, and this is the last recorded effort that she made that summarizes her 10000 Maniacs career.This CD is still better than anything she's offered thus far in her abyssmal solo career.Try also 10000 Maniacs' ""In My Tribe"" as the finest album of the 20th century. This CD is the most uplifting collection of recorded material ever."
2,Flat & uninspiring,"I'm a huge Natalie Merchant & 10,000 Maniacs fan, but this MTV Unplugged live concert is a big disappointment. I was hoping Natalie's crystalline natural voice would be enhanced without a recording studio's interference, but each song seems to have the same tempo, the same sound. The entire album was flat and uninspiring. I actually got sleepy driving to it. I'm too big a fan to give it 1 star, but this was a major disappointment."
4,A good book about lesser known mob figure,"This is a good book on a faction of the mafia not too much has been written about before. Actually encompasses the Angiulo family and goes back a little in Boston mafia history too before the rise of Angiulo. This was actually one of the first successful mafia cases where RICO was used. It goes into the bugging of the place plus a few other things like hits..and New York people who asked for someone to be taken out..like Phil Giacconne( Bonnano captain who was whacked by Sonny Black and Lefty Two Guns over Donnie Brasco thing in Florida, Sonny Black eventually got killed after it turns out Donnie is really an FBI agent). Anguilo wasn't all that well liked, and in fact very muderous even though he never made his bones himself by killing someone"
4,I like it,Not bad. It has a nice citrus smell to it and I saw results in my hair. Less frizz and more defined curls.
4,Clearly Underestimated This Album!!!!,"I always thought ""Get Up On It"", Keith Sweat's fourth album as underrated from his other albums, but since I bought the album about three weeks ago I think I have clearly underestimated this album.The slow songs on this album is arguably his best material! ""It Gets Better"", ""Get Up On It"", and ""Grind On You"" are my three favorites from this album. But Keith, take it from me, STICK TO THE SLOW SONGS!!!"
2,keiths worst,a verry sad album except how do you like it part1 which is an excellent track get the single
4,Gotta love cheesy sequels,"loved the first movie, this one was better. if you love cheesy syfy then you need to watch this movie."
2,S'Alright,"Well It's alright, but not quite what I was looking for. This would actually (despite the misleading title) be a great intro for under-graduates for those areas that my uni didn't teach.Things like ethics, problem solving, proffesionalism, and writing resume's, all the way up to epidemiology, quality control and proffessional writing are covered, albeit briefly (the average chapter is two to three pages long). This book, as I said previously, would be a good primer for new graduates in what to expect from a workplace other than all the technical why's and where-for's that have been jammed into their heads by theoretical lecturers.Unfortunately not a good resource for someone looking to improve their knowledge base when going for a promotion, and definitely not for those of you freshly promoted and foundering in a sea of paperwork and qc."
5,I Like This Book!,I like this book too! Al Jaffee's Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions is part of a series of books from Mad magazine. The humor is sarcastic and may not be for everyones tastes especially those people who are are offended by sarcastic humor but I personally thought that this book was funny and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes humor books and isn't offended by sarcastic remarks. Unfortunately the book is out of print though but I found it in a used book shop and this is definitely going to be a keeper!
5,Love this version!,Bought to use as a rehearsal aid. Wonderful collection and can be thoroughly enjoyed for many years. Arrived in a timely and efficient manner.
3,"3 Short Stories, NOT 1 Novel!","Even though the cover of Anderson's ""Shield of Time"" plainly states ""A Novel of the Time Patrol,"" this is NOT a novel. It's a collection of 3 Time Patrol short stories (possibly novellas) loosely related only by their subject matter, main character(s), and some tacked on, tiny, inter-chapters. They're decently written short stories. But, an awful lot of the material is taken up with just describing the historical settings. I also was not very happy with the holes in the author's theory of time travel. But, overall, assuming you don't mind short stories instead of the advertised novel, I rate this at an OK 3 stars out of 5."
4,this guy is the utmost,"i already had the album "" the jay miller sessions"" or whatever the name, so i had dug him previously. but i haven't had a record player so i got this, anyway long story short, this guy is the master of swamp blues. i'm sure there's other guy's doing this but i don't see how you could improve on this. i mean i'm a drummer & this dude lays down such a big fat groove, it's like man have i died & gone heaven. "" rainin in my heart"" is worth the price admission. it's like greasy!"
4,Great energy and well performed,The music was done at a fun tempo and had plenty of energy. I enjoyed this most among the renditions I have heard. I gave it four stars because I was hoping to hear dialog but it only has the music.
5,Incredibly helpful,"This is one of the best books on sales that I have ever read. I have been in sales for over 5 years and this book offers a ton of helpful and practical tools to improving your success in sales. I am having much more success getting in front of the decsion maker and my closing ratio has improved from 25% to over 85%. One of my favorite chapters was the one on personalities where I learned how to identify the personality of the person I am meeting with and how to sell to them most effectively. If you're in sales and you want to be more successful, this is the book to read!"
4,Changeling,Good movie. My problem was my computer was too slow and the picture had to pause to download too often. I won't be watching movies on my computer any more.
4,A must see,This is the 2nd movie I've watched with Angelina Jolie and I will certainly be on the lookout for other movies of this caliber with her in them. Clint Eastwood is great at directing this movie. The subject will scare you a bit because it involves children and mental health issues in a time period when not much was known on how to treat mentally ill patients. You leave wondering if this really could have happened in that time period. Food for thouht.
2,Disappointing,"What a shame. They took a really interesting true story and made a lousy movie out of it. By the end of this disappointing film I was so tired of seeing Angelina Jolie in that hat pulled down over her eyes. It's really hard to judge her acting by seeing only her mouth, but in this case, I guess it really doesn't matter. It's not even worth the $3.88 they're charging for it today."
3,Will Only Watch Once,"This a very dramatic storyline where Angelina Jolie's character comes home to find her son missing. Then after 5 months of searching the police come home with the wrong boy. After all the drama with the ""fake son"" the police declare her mentally incompetent and have her committed.It's a very depressing story without any hope of her finding her son since it is based on a true story. Jolie's performance was amazing but the story itself was grim and somber. This is a movie to rent not to have as a movie night on a rainy day."
5,Terrific,"I remember the review header from Rolling Stone magazine was (to paraphrase) : "" A F@#$ed-up album by a F$#@ed-up person "". I liked it so much, I must have played it on a daily basis back then. What was yet another change in Bowie's act is in this album he plays ALL the instruments, with the exception of drums. Not being a world class guitarist can be the downfall of a musical work, but not here. The ""cheapness"" of the sound adds to the decadent nature of the album; after all, this is NOT a happy-go-lucky singalong. My feeling at the time was that this was Bowie's version of the broadway musical ""Cabaret"" - with Bowie singing about the world going down the toilet while giving us a sly wink."
5,Reporter from the Apocalypse?,"Jacobovici has done excellent work here. I've watched the long program a number of times, having taped it on the night it premiered. It aired many times, mostly late at night, and has not received the attention it deserves. This documentary takes the viewer to many unusual and some dangerous places, and builds a circumstantial but convincing case.The subsequent discovery of Y-chromosome markers on traditional descendants of the Aaronite priesthood places the search for the Diaspora descendants into the realm of science. Regardless of the correct identification of each given tribe, Jacobovici's videos are well worth owning and viewing.The single and very minor criticism I have is the couple of somewhat sensationalist references to the possibility that we live in the end times, but that is not the primary focus of the video."
5,7.5 on the Richter!,"""Duplicity"" is well written and profoundly entertaining. toni Lee's characters are real, earthy and so exciting you forget that you're reading a book. The story moves with the force of an earthquake that registers 7.5 on the richter scale. There is no doubt that Ms. Lee is a Storyteller."
5,Ready For Prime Time,"Duplicity is thoroughly enjoyable. It was entertaining and intriguing and prepared readers for a hopeful sequel, with Clinton and Saa'iqa always one step behind each other. The family is a central theme, with Clinton's growing awareness driving the action. I do believe this book is ready for prime time, and that Toni Lee is an inspiring author, and one of the best."
4,The Cutest!!!,"OMG!!! Girl Authority is the cutest CD ever. Zoe is so cute, and they all have pretty good voices. Some of the songs kinda suck, but some of them are really good and are worth listening too. I'm 13, so I don't know if it's weird for me to like this stuff. Well, in general, I kinda want this CD. I hate Kidz Bop. This is like infinity times better!! What surprised me is that most of the girls are 14. They seem like a pretty cool group of people to hang out with. And even though I don't really like their version of Hollaback Girl, I still give this CD 4 stars!!!"
5,I would give it 11 stars if I could.,"This video is the best skating video ever made! I really hope that it comes back into production so that everyone can own it. It has so many great performances by so many stars of the figure skating world. In fact, it's so good that if it ever comes back into print, I'm going to buy myself another one!"
5,this is a must buy for reggaeton fans,"I picked up a copy of this album, I wasn't expecting much but it had 35 tracks and a bonus dvd, for less than $20.00 can't beat that, but when I got home and put the dvd in I noticed that the quality of the video is great, and it's not some cheaply put togheter free dvd like most albums have, but quality videos.the 2 music cds are excellent aswell, a lot of baby rasta and Gringo on both albums, some alberto stylee, Tego Calderon, Nicky Jam and others it's really a great buy, one of the 2 cd's by itself could be sold for like 15 bucks, you get 2 and the nice dvd, do yourself a favor and pick this album up. Panama in da house!!"
3,CD'S R O.K. BUT DVD IS NOT,I BOUGHT THIS CD B/C OF THE CHEAP PRICE:2 CD'S AND A DVD W/MUSIC VIDEOS FOR LESS THAT $10!BUT DEFINATLEY NOT ONE OF MY FAV. CD'S.THE MUSIC IS ALRIGHT BUT THE DVD IS SO LAME!(DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PREVIOS REVIEWER WAS TALKIN' ABOUT) ALMOST ALL THE MUSIC VIDEOS ARE REALLY CHEAP LOOKING BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY- THEIR ALL BORING.BUT I GUESS IF U CAN GET THIS FOR A CHEAP PRICE U SHOULD GET IT BUT DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING GREAT.
5,Great Carpenter Classic!,"This is one of the lost classic scores from John Carpenter (the other is They Live). This score was during the peak of his collaboration with Alan Howarth (who assists here with programming and engineering, but JC wrote all the tunes).Just as the other reviewer said, Carpenter was a master at subtle electronic music and diverse composition, and this CD is no exception to that. And he is correct in that there are two versions of this CD. This is the true, original score soundtrack with 8 tracks, including one by JC's band ""The Coupe de Villes"" which is way fun. The other CDImpossible to find, but if you see it pick it up, it's worth of any collection, especially a must have for Carpenter fans."
5,great cd,"THIS IS A GREAT BLUES ROCK CD.JUST LISTEN TO RORY WAIL ON THE SONG SHIN KICKER AND YOUR HOOKED.THIS ALONG WITH TOPPRIORITY ARE MY FAVORITES,BUT THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKE ALOT OF GUITAR."
5,blues rocker w/o peer,"I'll second everything in the previous reviews. ""Photo Finish"" is a showcase for Gallagher's incredible virtuosity, running the gamut from pedal-to-the-metal ravers to slow, reflective pieces. ""Shin Kicker"" and ""Brute Force"" are personal favorites, but there is not a weak track to be found. I had the pleasure of meeting and interviewing Rory after a show at Toad's Place near Yale U in the late 70s, on the ""Top Priority"" tour, absolutely smoking performance. He played one of Jimi Hendrix' old Strats that still had burn marks on it. I own practically everything he ever recorded, including some old Taste LPs; I even named my son Rory!"
2,It looks totally different from the picture,I purchased blue color but it looks totally diffenent from the picture. More bigger and not clear and not that pretty
3,The doll is alive!,"My daughter received this doll as a gift from her aunt. Her aunt knowing how fond her neice was of Dora said to save the best gift for last. When my daughter opened up the box she almost immediately said ""I scared"". It is kind of sad because we video taped the event thinking we would send it to her aunt. The doll looks kind of creepy and the mouth moves in a way that accentuates some scary facial expressions. Ie the talking clown in a horror movie.. Suffice it to say we passed by an end cap at a store the other day featuring this doll and once again she nearly freaked. The doll is made well, but my 3yr. old is still reeling from the first impression from 6+ mos. ago."
1,Beautiful Watch - But only worked for 2 days,"Watch arrived quickly and was packaged very well and was running with the correct time and I was impressed. However, when I went to wear it that weekend I discoved it had stopped working. I'm hoping it's the battery and I can find a jeweler close to me to replace it. If not I guess I've been had."
5,"""I Didn't Kill My Wife."" ""I Don't Care."" Start Running...For Your Life. The Chase Begins...","Note: This review is on the Expanded Soundtrack, which features 17 previously unreleased tracks.James Newton Howard has composed s suspensful score to match the hunt on screen. I recommend this soundtrack. Admittedly, he's done better, but I give it five stars because the action cues are well-orchestrated."
3,Buy the 2-disc set instead,"The Fugitive might be my all time favorite movie and my all-time favorite soundtrack, which is why, although the music on this set is very good, I can't recommend it.Instead, purchase the far more complete and satisfying two-disc special edition which really has the entire score and some nice extras on it. If you're on an extremely limited budget, however, this is worth a pickup."
1,Poor Quality,"Right out of the box you will see this is not well built, and the quality control is awful. I have had mine for about two months and the left channel blew out, completely useless now, had to buy a new one.Do you homework and buy a different brand, the DLO products are terrible regardless what people here say. This thing is NOT worth the money."
3,Great Product! On Second Try....,"Everything about this dock is great except for the fact that the first one that I bought arrived broken. After returning it to Amazon.com and getting a replacement all is well now and it works wonderfully. It looks great and its a nice way to keep my iPod charged. The on-screen menus are not of the greatest quality, but they get the job done. The audio quality is descent for most music you would put on an iPod since mp3's are reduced in quality as it is. The price is a little steep to have production issues, but once you get one that works, its worth the price."
1,Serious Quality Issues,"As expressed in other reviews, this this is a great idea, but has serious issues. Firstly, I had to return the unit TWICE before I got one that works (the first two would not play audio). Secondly, after I did get one to work, the sound quality is horrible. Thirdly, the thing get so hot you can barely stand to touch it. I was afraid that it would fry my iPod. Finally, there is absolutley NO technical support for this item. I called the sales line and got passed around like a hot potato and told repeatedly to ""find the solution on the website"".Bottom line - do not waste your money on this piece of junk. I am sending mine back for a refund."
5,Jacqueline du Pre,"Jacqueline du Pre fans should not be without this dvd. Christopher Nupen has put together a lasting tribute to a wonderful cellist. The biographical material is a retrospective of Jacquie's development as a musician ""of rare and vanishing beauty"". How poignantly evocative a statement!!! The dvd's culminating chapter is a complete rendition of the ""Elgar Cello Concerto in E-minor"". Daniel Barenboim conducts and Jacquie wrings our hearts with the passion of her playing. And if you enjoy this dvd, then you will love another Nupen dvd that puts Jacquie, Daniel Barenboim, Pinchas Zuckerman, Itzhak Perlman, and Zubin Mehta together playing Schubert's ""Trout""( The Greatest Love and The Greatest Sorrow). Jacquie is 24-all of them are in their twenties-and they all have so much fun while dazzling the audience with their talented playing. I never tire of watching and listening to both these dvds and I intend to buy them as Christmas presents for some of my friends."
5,Critics are dumb...,"I am extremely disappointed... Not with this phenominal cd, but with the idiot critics that consistently maintain the narrow-minded concept that the Femmes will never live up to their first album.This is a perfect example of how wrong that sentiment is. It opens up with a viscious punch in the junk (""Don't start me on the liquor. I'll drink it all down straight!"") that's just as musically complex as it is fun to listen to. The whole album is the classic, bouncy, rhythm heavy Femmes I've come to love. It's far more diverse than their debut (as all of their subsequent cd's have been). Their first cd is more pop-driven, but by no means better.I am the proud owner of every Femmes album, except Hallowed groud (which is on it's way as I write this), including the Aussie import, ROCK!, and they all rock my socks off.Buy this. Buy it and love it."
5,Really works!!!!!!!!!,"I have to say, I have alot of work out vidoes, but this one blows them all away. It is not for beginners, if you want to work up to this one, start with the ""30 day shred"", then use this one. I have lost 10 pounds in just 2 weeks. I have also eaten a well balanced low calorie diet with it, but it really speeds up the weight loss. I am not really that big of a person, 5ft 6in at 160 pounds, now at 150 pounds. I really just want to tone myself and get rid of my post baby weight and puffin top. I am not a person to work out, so I am really out of shape. I was winded during the workouts, but in a good way. It is a very good workout and your muscles will scream and so will you by the end of the workout. You have to make the time and do it at least 5-6 days a week though. Trust me, I have never hated someone as much as her at the end when I am cussing her out ;) It is a love/hate relationship I guess. She really will get you results fast if you stick to it and don't give up."
2,Reallllllly Harrrrddd!,I couldn't even finish this workout. It is really hard I will never another Jilian Michaels workout again because she is really tough in this video and from what I have read in reviews after I did this one
5,The Best!,"This was the workout that got me back to my slim self after having my two kids! It's very intense... and it works! I've lost over 70 lbs of baby fat which I had gained during my last pregnancy! Yes... I gained 70lbs during my last preggo!!! 60 lbs with the first, which I loss 53 lbs of it, before getting preggo the 2nd time! I still have a hard time believing it."
4,LOVE IT... but...,I gave birth 3 months ago and started working out when my little girl was just 6 weeks old. I bought this DVD when she was 8 weeks. I lost all the weight in a month. My body looks great. The workout is just hard enough for me ( i used to work out before i got pregnant). My only issue - my knees hurt like crazy from it. I used to work out 5 days a week but now I'm back to work so i will be working out just 3. Still even with a day of rest between workouts my knees hurt. It's really upsetting because i love this DVD and i can literally see my body changing. Any advice? I'm trying not to put pressure on my knees but i don't think it's working.Overall i recommend it especially for new moms who want to get back in shape fast.
4,Whew!,Whew! Talk about a workout! Jillian does not fail to deliver. I have a lot of her dvds including the 30 Day Shred which I loved. This one will definitely have you burning up the fat and losing weight in no time...just stick with it.
2,Jumping with Jillian,"Like a lot of other people I will agree that this is a tough workout. I wouldn't say it's toooo terrible but if you have any weakness in your joints you should be really cautious with this workout. There is a LOT, a LOT LOT LOT of jumping, very high impact exercise. One circuit is 100% jumping which is very hard on your knees and ankles. I stopped using this DVD after developing cysts in my knees. They went away in about a month."
2,A great way to injure yourself,"Every time I used this video, I either flared up an old ankle injury or end up injuring a knee-there's lots of jumps and spins. I don't mean just jumping jacks or running in place, which is fantastic, I means crazy jumps where you spin around or click your heels together. There are parts of the work-out that I love because it's cardio-heaven, but that's only about half."
5,Fabulous Workout -- NO Equipment Needed!,"I just did my first day of Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism, and I love love love it! I never thought I'd like a Jillian Michaels DVD, but I found her very motivating. The workouts in this DVD are very effective and, as Jillian says, blast my heart rate through the roof! (I was at 196 bpm after finishing this DVD, which is about the same as it is when I'm done sprinting.) I also love this DVD because I can do it in my tiny, cramped bedroom. I live on the upper floor, so when we get to a circuit with a lot of jumping, I just use a thick mat or take off my shoes.I'm very excited to continue this (I plan on doing this 4-6 times a week) and see the results and how it changes my body!"
5,No Dance Killer Cardio Workout!,"I bought this video after reading all the reviews and doing BL's Cardio Max for a few months as well as starting Jillian's 30 day Shred last week via Cable's On Demand. This is a basic, easy to follow cardio workout that is tough as nails. I didn't want another dance type cardio DVD and this workout is the complete anti-dance cardio workout. Easy to follow, basics moves, and straight forward circuit training will have you sweating into your eyeballs by the 5th circuit (wear a headband!) Yes, some circuits are much easier than others but you are still moving. This is intermediate to the low end of advance level. However, Jillian offers modified moves so beginners can definitely do it.Note: Wear appropriate footwear to help support and protect your knees as there is a tremendous amount of jumping in this video."
5,Awesome killer workout!!!,"I thought I was in good shape until I did Jillian's video, this is an awesome workout that anyone can do. She tells you how to make it easier or more challenging. I am going to purchase her other videos and highly recommend this one to anyone thinking about it!!"
5,"Awesome workout, as usual!","First off, I am a huge Jillian fan so this DVD would have to really stink for me not to like it. I loved it. As usual, she leads a great workout with lots of motivational talk throughout. I love her style - just hard core exercise - no dancing around.What I liked about this was that the workout flowed nicely. Even though I loved Shred (and lost 16 pounds in 35 days doing it) I got so tired of the up and down... jumping, then down for abs, up again jumping then down in the plank position. I would get dizzy from all the up and down! Not this workout - when you are down, you stay down and finish the circuit.Also, while there still are a lot of jumping moves, they are nicely spread out. The intervals themselves feel shorter in this DVD than Shred, too (it might be because I am in much better shape when I first did the Shred, too!).Tomorrow I am trying the Trouble Zones DVD. I hope it is just as good!"
3,"OK workout, endless blabbering and wretched ""music""","I think Jillian does a good job with this DVD although she never stops yapping and the ""music"" or whatever you want to call it, in the background is so annoying as to make me hit the mute button. She NEVER stops talking! It's pretty obvious what she is trying to accomplish, so why say it over and over and over? I was a bit surprised by the boxing moves and even more surprised that I wasn't at all sore the next day after working out with her for the first time--and I'm a 57 year old woman. So, I'll still use it, but I have to do it in silence."
2,BORING,"If you stick with the video, it does make you sweat, but it is so boring I am not motivated to punish myself through the workout again. I like videos that make me sweat and challenge both my cardiovascular endurance and muscular endurance... But I want the video to be fun and engaging so I don't dread coming back to the workout again... This video is one that I would dread coming back to. It is challenging, but not much fun."
5,this was HUMBLING!!!,"Let me say this...I have been steadily exercising for a few years now, but over the holidays I have been feeling a little sluggish. I bought this DVD and thought it would be a 'nice' addition to my workout routine. There's nothing 'nice' about this DVD...this kicked my BUTT! I was huffing and puffing by the first 20 minutes - and soaked! I was very impressed and I know I'll be super-sore tomorrow. My sister and I are planning on starting the 30 Day Shred on Sunday, but I might alternate every other day with this DVD. I'll continue doing this throughout the rest of the week. I highly recommend it."
2,Do not buy this,"Save your money. Go get Netflix. This movie is available there as a Watch Instantly title. It's worth watching, but be prepared for a colossal disappointment in the abrupt ending."
2,Derivative but interesting except the ending was a total fail!,"First, I see a lot of people comparing this to Saw and other movies within the last 5-10 years. I'm going to show my age and compare it to Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None or Ten Little Indians, which is where Saw comes from IMO. But since I knew going in that this was a new version of an old story, that didn't bug me too much. It was an interesting story up to a point, putting the woman who couldn't speak English in was silly to me, how can she participate to save her life when she can't understand anyone and no one can understand her? Despite that, I have to admit that the story did keep me interested, but the ending IMO totally sucked, i.e. the last 30 seconds or so. Up until that point, I thought the movie derivative but decent."
4,she's the kind of woman.,"a goddess within the music industry whose praises have gone largely unsung for the two-plus decades in which she's been active, angela winbush does not disappoint. an accomplished singer, song-writer and producer, _angela winbush_ reminds us of all the artists who have influenced her, as well as those she has influenced. if you listen closely, you will hear shades of everybody from phyllis hyman to marva hicks. and, on a non-musical note, is that one fierce cover photo, or what?"
2,Ridiculous,"I have very high regard for Mary Kay Ash, but the writer of this book is ridiculous. She was hired to write Mary Kay's principles of living a rich life and I cannot believe that Mary Kay ever would have suggested watching the financial reports on the news and saying ""hmmm"" as you watch to make yourself look interested so that your husband will be impressed. This is an actual suggestion from the book. I'm not sure I can finish this book."
4,How cute!!!,"I thought this book was okay, that I gave it 4 ****. All I can say that this book is unpredictable and I can't put the book down. Craig (main male character) is different from Jill. He's serious about life and...wants to make sure he accomplished his goals. While Jill, she always want to have fun and date, like 2 guys at the same time. If you really know about Sweet Valley High series, Jill will (hey, that rhymes! :) reminds you of Jessica Wakefield. It's weird that Craig and Jill are in love with each other. I guess it's true: opposites attract."
4,One Step Closer To Sobriety..,"""Young Americans"" wasn't a good album. He gets credit for venturing into soul, but for me it didn't work. On this album, though, he has a lot of R&B elements, but they somewhat echo his future works with Brian Eno and the ""Berlin Trilogy.""The songs are very catchy, and some of them are even eerie (but we haven't gotten to Warszawa yet), but sometimes it is a challenge to sit through this record in one sitting. ""TVC15"" is my least favorite song on the album, and sometimes his crooning on ""Word On A Wing"" is something of an acquired taste, but it is a very rewarding listen overall, and after releasing this album, Bowie got clean for good. After the misstep of Young Americans, Station to Station is a very worthy comeback."
1,A bit weird,A little bit of a funny album. sounds like he's on drugs or drunk or something. not a patch on let's dance.
4,Jim De Rogatis should be sent out to pasture!,"I am usually a gentle person, Jim DeRogatis, but I put it to you that both you and your egotistical, mean-spirited, pseudo-sophisticated criticism of great art will rapidly be forgotten by History, whilst great musical masterpieces like 'From the edge of a deep Green Sea' by The Cure (To name just ONE amongst NUMEROUS lovely songs that you have trashed), will be remembered and treasured by other human beings for a long long time. Time is the best proof of quality, and the Cure's marvellous music will continue to soar, conquering time and transcending place, long after your petulance is no more...why a great site such as Amazon pay you good money is quite beyond me..."
1,Bad theology and poor translation,"If you are looking for an accurate translation of the New Testament into modern English or a translation executed by a group of people dedicated to the truth, then you will be disappointed here.Several years ago I emailed a critique of this version to Priests for Equality, laying out some of the problems with this translation. From a reading of just the first few chapters of Luke, I discovered that feminism was the motivating force of this translation, not a commitment to accuracy. This critique went unacknowledged to this very day.This translation will not hurt you to read, however it is not a good investment when there are many other more accurate modern translations available to the reader."
5,Do you know what the temp is in your frig?,"Now when I open the frig/freezer door, I know the exact temp in either one. Obviously food lasts longer when kept near 32degrees in the frig and zero, in the freezer. Now I know where to set the number thermostat!"
1,Not good.........,"Compared the readings from this thermometer to two older mercury type thermometers and found this unit to read higher, anywhere from 5 to 8 degrees.Too bad, because the dial is nice and large and easy to read."
3,Serves its purpose,Nothing special about this product. We use it in a wine refrigerator and I'm not sure how accurate it is or isn't.
2,Not Accurate,"I purchased this thermometer to replace an inaccurate one. I now have two inaccuated ones.I purchased the Taylor commercial digital ""food"" thermometer at the same time. I calibrated the ""food"" thermometer (as per the instructions) in a ice bath. The Taylor ""food"" thermometer was accurate.I then compared the calibrated food thermometer to this freezer-refrigerator thermometer, at refrigeration temperatures (38 degrees). This freezer-refrigerator thermometer reads 8 degrees low. This is a potential safety hazard since a refrigerator at 50 degrees would read at a safe level of 42 degrees.I expected better accuracy, especially since this product bears the NSF logo. There is no calibration adjustment knob/screw on this model.I plan to contact the manufacturer for a replacement."
2,Ordered & received 2,"Since the hurricane last month I thought it would be wise to put a thermometer in each of our refrigerators & freezers. So I ordered 2 of this model. While nice in appearance, I found 2 disconcerting issues: They are not made in the US, and; they differed in temperature readings by almost 5 degrees. Not very reassuring when the ideal refrigerator temperature range is between 32 & 40 degrees - a range of 8 degrees."
3,It's Great if it's Accurate!,"I purchased four of these thermometers. Two of which matched my electronic house thermostat exactly. The other two were off by 2 - 3 degrees. The display is large and very easy to read so I give it high marks for design. The bottom line is that if you are lucky enough to get one that works, you will be completely satisfied (5 stars). I returned the two that didn't work, free of charge, and received a full refund from Amazon."
1,Definitely Inaccurate,"I bought two of these thermometers. They arrived but the displayed temperatures do not agree at all. They are 5 degrees off. At least one is inaccurate but I have no confidence that the other one is accurate either. I do not know if 5 degrees is important or not. There is no calibration knob on the thermometer or a procedure for figuring out if the thermometer is accurate. Then I checked the Taylor website and they do not even have any specifications for the thermometer's accuracy. (No specification like +/- 1 degree or 2 degrees or whatever.) I guess you just pay for it and ""believe"" that it is accurate. But, as I said, I bought two of them so I know at least one is off base. I guess I will be sending both back and will try a different brand product. What a waste of time."
5,Easy to Read!,"I purchased this for my RV fridge, since it is so temperamental. It is a great size and is easy to read. I love that it has the different zones with the temperatures and is color coded!"
5,Recommend!,"It is amazing how much longer food lasted in the refrigerator before spoiling after we adjusted the temperature slightly so that it was within the the ""recommended"" range. This will definitely help us reduce our food bills by preserving the quality of our food longer."
2,"Some good tracks, but doesn't stand well on it's own .......","Not a great track sequence, so it's probably not a keeper, but an interesting sampler for a beginner. It might be better to listen to the samples on this page, and if you like one (or more), buy the album it was originally released on.Peter White's track shows why his album ""Glow"" is a must have."
5,Blast from the Past!,"EXCELLENT!! BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES!! WOULD BUY FROM AMAZON AND THIS SELLER AGAIN, PRICE EXCELLENT AND THE SPEEDY DELIVERY WONDERFUL TOO. THE COMPILATION OF THIS ALBUM WAS SOOO GOOD, SONG AFTER SONG...MADE YOU JUST SING ALONGGREAT BUY"
3,3 stars cuz it was sorta interesting...,"This movie was interesting. But what was up with casting Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies? Nuh-uh. She is so unlike Davies it's like she's being someone else, some other flapper. But the movie was intersting with nice songs. But there's nothing like the good ol' 20s. I'd rather watch the real Davies in a silent than wallow around in this movie with weird portrayls of past stars, but that's just me, an old soul."
1,Horrible,"This has to be THE worst movie I have ever seen. I was so excited because it has Joanna Lumley who I love from AbFab. And I think Jennifer Tilly is adorable. But the movie in whole was a disapointment. I agree with a previous review, that the relationship between Kirsten Dunst and that old man wasnt convincing. I thought he was her father for the most part, partly because she called him daddy. All in all, I wouldnt recomend this to anyone, except maybe insomniacs who need help to get to sleep, because thats all this movie will do for you."
2,The cat's litter box,"This movie was boring. There was no chemistry between the actors and it dragged on way too long. The only thing that made it interesting was that it was based on a true story. I've been to the Hearst castle and I think they could have done so much more to it than they did. Kirsten Dunst, once again, shows off her talent for picking stupid movies and then giving them her all."
2,Take away about 1200 pages and it might be ok...,"I read most (all right, some) of this book. But as I was skipping ahead, I did not notice any significant change in the ""plot"" or ""themes"" (I use these terms very loosely). I am not shocked easily. However, I must say that I was shocked by this book. Shocked that an author can repeat the same mindless drivel, with no characterization, no plot, and hardly any development to speak of for as long as Sade managed to in Juliette. While initially titillating, I found the book to be ultimately exasperating, his nihilism juvenile, his philosophical cynicism infantile, his plotting sophomoric, and his point, well I must admit, I never found that."
5,A must-read for any Bluetooth novice,"This book is excellent, especially for a layman. When I read this book after reading the Bluetooth specification many times, it seems to fill a few gaps the specification didn't cover. There some things the specification did not explain fully or that are not quite clear. That is where this book came in very handy. For example, the specification mentions CVSD encoding, which is explained in this book.It didn't delve into too much technical detail, for which we have the spec itself. But, it did cover all the important information we should pay attention to when learning about the Bluetooth. Also, the peer technologies like WirelessLAN (802.11), HomeRF etc. are discussed in brief to give an understanding of what options are available for wireless solutions.I liked the layout and font of the book too. I think, this book is certainly worth buying (especially if you are getting it for 29.99 in Frys)."
4,Maybe not pure Irish...,"...but it lets us see what other styles have to offer while remaining true to its roots. Go straight to track ten, ""Islanders,"" if you ever want to stir up a high-steppin' dance party at your house."
5,Amazing Hard Rock!!!,"Somewhere between Revis and Shinedown on the ""heaviness"" scale, you will find Lo-Pro. This band encorporates some suprisingly intense riffing with almost-elegant vocal phrasing. Very well-written songs from beginning to end! Check out the sound samples and see for yourself: This is a must purchase!!!"
3,"Phenomenal front man, generic background noise","Obviously, this band has members form Ultraspank in it, which is my main reason for even showing any interest in them. Made up of members from Godsmack, snot, and ultraspank, it sounds promising, but ends up being just more generic radio rock, ala staind. So, if you're into that kind of thing, then this cd is right up your alley. However, if you are a fan of ultraspank, then don't expect that here.My only reason for listening to this band, and allowing myself to like them, is because of their lead singer, Pete Murray. This guy has the most amazing vocals of any band out right now. He was the main reason I liked Ultraspank, so it only stands to reason that I would have to like this band a little. So, if you want to get a mediocre album, with an excellent lead singer, then get this cd."
4,"Better than most but ""Genius"" is misleading",I like this book because the puzzles are more challenging than other books that make similar claims. But the challenge is primarily avoiding making stupid mistakes--each level seems to possess about the same degree of difficulty and does not include some of the more esoteric solving challenges that I would like to learn more about.
4,THIS WILL DO,"IM A LONG LIVED ANITA FAN FROM THE START BUT THIS ALBUM SEEMED A LITTLE DULL COMPARED TO HER LAST ,MAYBE CAUSE SHE WENT AWAY AND HAD KIDS HER TUNE WENT FROM ROMANTIC, QUIET STORM TO PARENT ON MOST,IN ALL A FEW STAND OUT BODY N SOUL I APOGIZE.AND MY ALL TIME REMAKE( YOU BELONG TO ME ),CAN YOU BELIEVE J-LO REDID THIS ASWELL .SHE CANT HOLD A TUNE TO ANITAS VERSION"
2,Only one track was of value,Was recommended by a friend. NOT my kind of music.Difficult to listen to carefully.Donated to charity....... maybe someone will like it.
1,Didn't like content,It centered too much on the gay employee and didn't put a very good image of him forward. After the first 50 pages I wasn't interested in finishing.
2,What in the hell was that?,"This is what came to mind once I got done watching this-the most pitifull, pointless, regrettable piece of drivle since Ayame's High Kick. I mean come on, those scrawny emmaciated characters looked like they were scrawled by a drunken third grader drawing with his non-domminant hand. The plot had no redeeming value what so ever and the characters had all the flair and feeling of a stale rice cake. All in all I'm glad I didn't have to pay to rent it. If your lookin' for good anime watch Akira, Ghost In The Shell, or Ninja Scroll. But if you just love to be dissapionted then watch this or Battle Arena Toshinden(which actually had better animation than FF but the story is a worthless attempt at story telling at best)."
2,Not fore senior Java developers jumping into C++,"I bought this book due to the high reviews. I found this book lacking in answering any questions I had about C++. I was jumping into an existing C++ application and needed to know how to implement my ideas using C++ syntax, and understand the code I was expected to fix. It did not cover:- parameter passing (reference, pointers, or value types)- over-riding methods- abstract class (virtual methods, pure virtual methods)- how to create objects, variable name, class name. All new to Java developers that put everything on the heap.It would be nice to cover project layout as well. Java has only a few structures and C++ seems to be the wild west. The fact that implementations can be in multiple source files and/or multiple libraries was not covered at all. This was a very new and confusing concept to a long time Java developer. Maybe this is more of a review for C++ developers coming back to the fold."
5,i want to learn how to raise lovebirds and know them.,"hi, my name is Bassam. how are u? i want to buy that book of yours, i hope i will know everything about lovebirds. i got two love birds in my house, a male and a female. so i want to learn their behaviors and how they breed etc...so please i want to order u're bookbuy."
3,one reservation,Only recently received the item and my first impression was to agree with other reviewers.I was disappointed to see that it was made in China.
2,Two and a half stars,"This album would have been a stoner classic if it weren't for the lame ""hard rock"" vocals. Honestly, that guy kills anything the cool riffs had going for them."
2,damage product,"i have told you that the cd shows just the first 4 tracks, the last one other 6 it doesn't sounds, it seems to be not record, its diffucult but it happens in few times, thank you!"
3,Very small address book,"This address book is cute, but the amount of space for information is very small. As long as you have extremely good vision and can read little tiny print, and can write in little tiny print, this will be a great address book."
5,STILL THE BEST,"I, too, was lucky enough to read this book when it came out in the 80's (while in HS myself). I had a used book seller find me an out of print copy (hardback no less). I re-read it every couple of years. FYI to anyone else who loved this, the author did do another book that I was able to get from the library (not quite as good, but it does have a couple of the characters from the first book as adults). It was called something like the Last Mongoose (I know Mongoose was in the title). Anyway, I highly recommend this book to others."
4,Wish that all the Bachelor /bachelorette seasons are on DVD,"I liked the best of the Bachelor but I don't want just the first bachelor on DVD I want all the Bachelor seasons on DVD and all the Bachelorette seasons also and until Mike Fliess does that he won't see five stars from me! Other than that, I liked it!"
2,Where is the content?,"I didn't find the writing style of this book amusing, nor was I interested in wading through the superfluous language to find the interesting tidbits of information the book contained."
1,THIS BOOK IS BAD,"TO BAD I HAD TO GIVE IT 1 STAR, IF IT WERE UP TO ME I'D GIVE IT 0, NO NEGATIVE 10. I AM A HUGE MATT DAON FAN AND HE IS SO FINE, EVEN SO THIS BOOK WAS POORLY WRITTEN AND SHOULD BE BURNED."
3,Took 20 days to see some results,I first was a bit disappointed couse couldnt really see any improvement in the eye area...but after 15 or 20 days I could see some difference not extraordinary but ok...!!
2,Disappointing,"After reading and enjoying Lyle Lyle Crocodile and The House on East 88th St, we were disappointed to find how uninspired this title was. It felt recycled and lacked the joyful flair of the other 2 books. In it, Lyle finds himself the recipient of hate letters. ""I hate you"" is a common refrain and they are signed ""your enemy."" The tone of the letters is really hostile and not appropriate for a children's book. This is especially true in this day and age where almost any threat has the potential to turn violent. Skip this one."
5,Beautiful solo piano,"Irish pianist John O'Conor has eloquent phrasing, and impeccable technique. And this album is proof of that...21 beautiful songs, played as only a pianist of the highest caliber can play them. This album is very highly recommended. You don't have to be a classical connossieur to enjoy it...I most certainly am not. A lot of the pieces are very familiar, and as you hear them, you may find yourself saying ""Oh, I know that song"". This is the album that opened me up to more classical works, and since aquiring this, I have purchased more works by the composers on this album."
4,Give a Dog a Home!,"What a lovely way to teach children `tis better to give than receive.' With few words and no rhymes - except for the author/illustrator's name, of course, and delightful black/white/aqua pictures of Claude the Basset and his homeless friend Bummer, all ages can delight in the spirit of kindness and compassion at Christmastime. But am I the only one bummed because Bummer didn't get a home for Christmas?/TundraVision, Amazon reviewer."
3,Good but not great,"Bought this book for more insight into trying to solve my acid reflux problem. Book covers a lot about the digestive system. Very interesting. The book takes a nutritionist view of digestive health. Not bad, but a little too focused on using food and natural supplements as a way to solve all the problems. Much of the information about solving problems with food I already knew from my doctor, brochures and the internet (places like WebMD). So the book was informative, but not entirely useful to me. My expectations were higher."
4,Managing your health,Liz Lipski put together a great book on digestive health that can be used as an excellent guide to maintaining good health or help one to attain good health. The focus on digestive health in this book is important due to the gut being the gateway to the body. Much of our overall health depends on the gut being healthy. This would be a book I encourage you to buy if you desire to live a healthier lifestyle.
5,One of Nitzer Ebb's best singles.,"I remember searching thru Bleeker Bob's and Vinyl Fetish in Hollywood searching for the 7"" single of this song. I never found it, but I did get ahold of the 12"" and Limited 12"".For a while the 'Belief' cassette was the only one I had and I played it non-stop for months.The two versions of 'Hearts and Minds' are really great. That was back when they just extended songs rather than tying some lame house music medley to everything.'For Fun' gets its deserved remix, and 'Time Slips By' (the original flipside to the single) gets remixed very nicely as well."
5,Pink Cadillac,Once again I was impressed on how quickly the product arrived. The quality of the diecast model is outstanding! It looks like they took a real one and shrunk it down to size. It looks exactly like the real thing.
2,Not the Elvis Pink Cadillac,"If you are looking for the ""Elvis"" pink Caddy he bought his Mother this isn't it.That was what my Father thought he wanted. Fortunately my Father isn't techno enough to use the internet.This is the caddy both I and my brother bought him for xmas. Yes, we bought him the same thing. I also bought him the God-Father Caddy to boot. We had him open my pink Cadillac last. He was very happy to have two ""Elvis"" Cadillacs.However, if you want the true Elvis ""bought his Mother"" Cadillac, that would be a 1956 pink Cadillac de ville, which Franklin Mint discontinued and now routinely sells for $150.00+I used to subscribe to the Franklin Mint cars for my father $39.00 a month. I did find an off brand true Elvis Cadillac for less than $80.00 but it was also a discontinued brand.Good Luck!"
5,Spiritual!,"This is a magnificent recording. Even though, a capella CD's can sometimes be hard to stomach, I find myself listening to this disc again and again. This recording will literally lift your spirits. Gorecki's Totus Tuus is epitome of sublime, easing effortlessly across the span of 11 minutes. Part's Magnificat is a little darker in tone, but if you are patient it will blossom repeatedly. Martin's Mass is somewhere between ethereal and madrigal. Barber's Agnus Dei, based on his Adagio for Strings, is uncannily eerie, yet powerfully cathartic at the same time. Finally, Schoenberg's Peace on Earth is emotionally buoyant, absolutely gorgeous, and sadly, just as relevant now as it was when it was written almost a century ago. The aural depth captured by Telarc will engulf you in sound. Shaw conducts each of these modern masterpieces with aplomb and the Festival Singers sing their lungs out. An exciting album, it is definitely worth being a part of anyone's collection."
5,My favorite record... it is phenomenal!,"This is a must have record the first 9 songs are without a doubt the strongest first 9 songs of any record i know of (next closest is GD's American Beauty), in fact any three of them would be enough killer material to make any album a great album. This record is monumental... if i had to make a list of my top 50 favorite individual songs by any artist of all time i'd include thalassocracy, calistan, speedy marie, superabound. Do yourself a favor & get this record!"
1,Bad Quality,"I just wanted to remember my chilhood with this DVD, but please do not buy it. The quality of this DVD is the worst I have ever seen in my life."
2,"Happy, 'til it broke.","We were very satisfied until it broke; about one year. At the price we won't complain. However, we won't reorder and would have preferred black."
2,A shallow scattered attempt,"I can only assume that Mr. Cleaveland was attempting to woo the legions of Web site developers into writing program generators (PG) with this book. The book centers around a pointless example of how to generate pop-up web pages which call each other when their respective buttons are pressed.Out of the 13 chapters, 3 are worth mentioning. Chapters 4, 6, and 7 deal with what to consider when writing a PG and how to make it flexible and Mr. Cleveland does bring some worthwhile points to the table. Throughout the other chapters, trivial code snippets are given of how to write the code (in Java, DOM, and XSLT) to generate the pages, however, because the examples are so simplistic any one who knows these languages would know how to write them anyway.In the future, I would strongly recommend the following:1. Give examples that people will actually want to use2. Give examples that highlight your points3. Get rid of chapters 2 and 3 (domain analysis), they are useless."
1,good transaction but product not the greatest,I had purchased and used other cool bandanas in the past and loved them. These bandanas when fully saturated are so stiff that they will hardly bend around your neck to tie and then they are uncomfortable because they are so tight. It didn't cool very much either. I had saturated my bandana then put it in a zip lock bag to take with me like I had done with other brands. The service from the seller was just great with prompt shipment.
2,Bowie in an identity crisis!!!,"It's true!! It's Bowie's worst album along with ""Tonight"". The songs are flat and uninspired. Bowie wasn't much envolved with the recording of ""Never Let me Down"". He even left others arrange his own songs. Bowie was definetly divorcing from the cutting edge. But it's not a totally avoidable album. For example ""Time will crawl"" is only one of his best songs from the 80's, i can't believe this song wasn't a big hit. ""Glass Spider"" is another song that deserves some attention. It sounds like something off the ""Diamond Dogs"" era. ""Never Let me Down"" is a simple ballad with a great melody. And finally ""The beat of your drum"" the catchiest song of this set. This track would fit very well in the ""Let's Dance"" album. The rest is easily forgetable unless you're a Phil Collins or Chris de Burgh fan."
2,Boring,"This is avery tedious CD. Not just the rather uninteresting music, but most especially the boring way in which McKellen reads the wonderful Creation text. Give me Haydn's Creation any day!!"
4,Expensive but works.,"I installed this in my mom's computer, and thus far, it's working fine. My only complaint is that it's expensive. Still, I would have preferred to purchase the 1GB, but Amazon was not selling the Kingston variety. The 512MB will suffice for now. Adding memory is a great way to boost a computer's performance."
3,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the story The Speckled Band in this collection. It is so outlandish and its nothing like the original story. The rest of the stories were sensational but the production of The Speckled Band, I expected better."
5,This CD was a gift.,This CD was a gift and the recipient really loved it. I own this CD myself and enjoy it and others by The Derek Trucks Band.
2,Preferred His Other Albums,"I've been a big fan of Derek since the early days, but just couldn't get into this album. It was New Age kinda stuff to me. I was really listening hard for some of the old blue's playing to come a shining through. Didn't hear it.A lot of positive reviews here. Just not my style."
1,Not what i was expecting,"Not the kind of music i was expecting to hear when i purchased the cd. I was looking for a real rockin, bluesy, jam on kind of album seems how he is from the Allman Bros. Band. NOT THE CASE. This album is a total waste of time and money. Turns out its like world music, with a hint of gospel and new age jazz. Total Let down from what i was expecting after ""Rolling Stone"" named him one of the new guitar gods. DEREK TRUCKS IS NOT A GUITAR GOD, HE IS A TOTAL WASTE !"
2,Irksome at times.,"I'm not saying that Katell isn't a talented artist, that she is not original, this album is simply not that accessible - partly due to its weirdness. If one wants to hear spoken sections on an album, that's OK, and yes, it's atmospheric, but I personally prefer to listen to MUSIC instead. The song ""O seasons"", ""Partisan"" and ""Franklin"" are stunning indeed but the rest is sometimes way too jazzy or simply irritating for me (Katell's vioce is at times even frightening - while listening to ""Burden"" one can really FEEL THE BURDEN of the act of listening to such a song). Overall, this purchase was a great disappointment, because I really thought it was gonna be something at least as good as Natalie Merchant. (And yes, though I've not listened to the Natalie's version of ""Gulf of Araby"", I'm sure she's done it better.)"
4,surprisingly good,I got this because I saw the Switzerland episode on line. The video quality was surprisingly good and content is superb. The Swiss episode has all the beauty of the Swiss railways (from steam to electric) that would satisfy any rail enthusiast and the other two episodes are ok as well.
3,A nice collection of songs,"This is Phish's 4th studio album (not including Junta). It consists of mostly shorter songs (2 to 5 minutes long). Except for the last track, there is no jamming. The CD is 46 minutes long.There are some very nice songs on this albums, like Julius, Sample In a Jar, Down With Disease and If I Could. There are some songs, like Wolfman's Brother, that are much better here, than done live (and I am a huge fan live music). These songs are well arranged and produced, with guest musicians and background singers. The horns on Wolfman's Brother make it a fun song.There are some songs, like Dog-Faced Boy and Scent of A Mule that just throw away little ditties. It is because of these songs, and that there is only about 30 minutes of really good stuff that I give this CD only 3 stars. It might be close to 4 stars."
3,"Down with ""Hoist""?","Alot of people complain that ""Hoist"" includes too much pop-rock, and not enough jam, but my complaint is that it just doesn't flow well. Don't get me wrong, musically it's impressive, and there's some really good stuff on here, but front to back it doesn't hold up like those before it, or since. There's a few catchy upbeat tracks like ""Down With Disease"", ""Sample In A Jar"", and ""Wolfman's Brother"", and there's a few pretty and mellow songs like ""Dog-Faced Boy"", ""If I Could"", and ""Lifeboy"", but some of the remaining tracks border on annoying. Obviously this is still good, and it's a must for fanatics, but newcomers should get another disc first. One thing that I do really love about ""Hoist"" though, is that it's a cool word to say."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"Another condescending book by someone who has never dealt with the real world. SAVE YOUR MONEY! The few tidbits of useful information are not worth the unrealistic and contrived examples he uses to prove his theoretical but worthless points. If I see another book about Foobar, Floob or other blather, I will barf. Another ""if you can't find a natural key, you're an idiot"" author. But let's use Social Security Number, or Player Number or Game Number or Team Number or VIN Number. Ever hear of identity theft? Deal with that the next time you insist on making Social Security Number your primary key. ""You won't give me your Social Security Number Mr. Customer? I guess we won't take your order."""
2,Good service but poor product,"The vendor of these Air Force style sunglasses offers very good and responsive customer service, but the product itself is not high quality.When he sent the sunglasses the described case was not included. I contacted the vendor, and he readily and quickly gave a partial refund which was most appreciated.What marred my experience was the fragility of the sunglasses, which soon broke during normal use after only weeks."
3,About what I expected,"These earrings are pretty, but the quality is certainly not top of the line. The casting is a little rough, and the stones are just so-so. You basically get what you pay for on these. If you like the design, they are nice to have, but not good enough for out on the town."
3,Ok item,"I purchased this for my husband because he claimed his friend has one that is awesome. I think it is about the same as the other one he had, but whatever makes him happy. I am not impressed."
4,A nice add on,"I purchased this primarily to listen to podcasts while in my car, and it fulfills that function more than adequately. It is easy to use, and I have had little difficulty using it in Atlanta and Boston. As others have noted, these devices work better in rural areas. Also as others have noted, it is no substitute for a CD nor, in my opinion, a ""real"" FM station; however, if you do not mind that the music sounds ""thin"" and the infrequent static in parking garages, certain bridges, etc., it works well. It does quickly charge my iPod. I do not regret buying it."
1,Poor Quality,"Display quit working first day. Unit was replaced. Display went out on second unit after few hours. Finally, second unit quit working altogether in just a few days."
3,Monster IPod Transmitter/Charger,"This transmitter/charger should be awesome but I have a feeling that living in the city of Chicago makes it difficult. There is one station on the settings I use and it barely works in the city and I have to put my Ipod in one specific spot. However, when I drive out to the suburbs it works almost perfectly. There is no static and the songs come through clear. I would have preferred a transmitter/charger that had more than 3 radio stations to choose from but this is my own fault. I think anyone who bought this product and lived outside of a major city will be fine. If you live downtown, you will probably have difficulty staying away from static."
1,"Save your money, do not buy!","I purchased this product at my local WalMart for $69.95. For starters, it has eight pre-programmed stations to choose from and that's it. I live in San Diego and 6 of the 8 pre-programmed stations already have permanent broadcasting on them, so you can rule them. Therefore, we are left with two viable options for stations to attempt to broadcast your iPod onto. I say attempt because the signal quality varies greatly as you drive and your songs will be randomly and frequently interrupted by static. I will be taking mine back as soon as I get off work and giving one of the cheaper models a try."
3,Just ok.,"I'm happy that I can use my iPod in my car, but maybe our area is not the best place for an fm transmitter. I'm often changing the stations to find a clearer station, and when the station is clear, the sound is muffled. I have a '98 Nissan Altima with an aftermarket stereo and pretty decent speakers. My husband has '04 Ford Escape with a stock stereo and speakers, and it sounds much better in his car. I do like the fact that it charges the iPod while you use it. Works well enough for now."
3,Just Ok,This monster cable has preset FM stations. I have found that the presets don't work very well in my area. The monster cable that allows you to set the stations is much better.
2,Just pain OK.....,"Purchased the iCarPlay months ago and really haven't been blown away by its performance at all. I would have to guess the level of static you recieve all depends on your area, but I can't get a clear station anywhere in my town. Seems to work best out in the middle of knowhere or while traveling on the interstate. Went ahead and hardwired the Ipod thru an EXT on my cd player and that seems to be the way to go. Its a pretty easy install but even if you need to have it installed I would say its more than worth it."
1,FM Transmitters Are CRAP,"If you want to use your IPOD in your car, invest in a head unit that has AUX IN plugs. Don't waste your time or money trying to make these devices work-especially in an urban area."
4,Definitely a good purchase,"I am completely happy with this product, I was skeptical at first but I have found that with little adjustment my ipod works perfectly in almost any area, this is definitely one of the best purchase I have made, worth every penny!"
4,Not too shabby...,"This product is an extremely good idea. In fact, I wish that I could have selected 4.75 Stars. The iCarTrip could benefit greatly from the use of a bigger transmitter. I have to battle with a little bit of fuzz even when the selected station is 'blank.' It still sounds better than when I use my old tape adapter. I am not sure what is in it now, but increaseing the capacity a milliamp or two could really boost performance.It is really easy to use, and I love the fact that I can keep my iPod charged all at the same time, It is really beneficial on a long road trip. Sure, the battery life says 12 hours, but that is without backlight functionality, and changing the songs frequently. Also, I do not have to bring my AC adapter on vacation... one less thing to leave in a hotel room.Plus... more and more cars are coming out without a tape deck. The tape deck can be $225 more in some cases. $48.87 is a lot easier on the ol' wallet!To conclude... Nice work!(My apologies for typos)"
4,Great while it lasted,"I have owned this product for approximately a year and a half. I got it for free from my brother who works for Goodwill Computers. He had previously given me several other ipod fm transmitters that had worked terribly, and I was thrilled when I got this one that not only worked well, but charged my ipod and did not require batteries. I used this charger in many cities throughout Texas and took it on several road trips to New Mexico, Louisiana and one all the way to Mexico City and back and the whole time it worked great with minimal static on occasion. Last week I lent it to a friend for a weekend trip and I believe it may have been yanked around because now it does not seem to have a stable connection with the ipod and isn't picking up channels well. I got online and was shocked to discover that this adapter costs $85 new and while I was pleased with the performance of the product, I have yet to decide if it is worth that much for a year and a half of use."
2,Poor sound quality,"When i was looking for an FM transmitter for my i-pod, I knew that the sound would not be digital quality, but I was still extremely dissapointed by the sound quality of this product. Of the ten channels to choose from I could only pick up the i-pod on two of them. The two stations that did pick it up had horrible sound quality (static and hollow sounding). I know FM transmitters aren't perfect, but this one isn't even close."
1,Not a good item,In Philadelphia you cannot get a clear station. It is static throughout the majority of the city. Not a good item if you live in a big city.
4,transmitting fm,this item works well when you are park i use it when working around the yard. when driving fades in and out alot just alright.
1,Do NOT waste your money!!,"This is a piece of garbage. What a waste of 70 bucks!!! It did not work at ALL. Constant static, no way to fine tune. It has the look and feel of something you'd find at the bottom of a cracker jack box. Go with the PodFreq by Sonnet."
2,moster cable,"i received this item on time from Amazon and i was happy with them, but the product isnt what i expected. the reception is not so great i get alot of static. i am not pleased."
1,Buy if you love the sound of static!!,Sound was fuzzy at best with all frequencies - avoid this product.
1,Just buy a tape adapter,"Very poor sound quality. That's all there is to it. Great idea, but unless you are in an area with very few occupied stations, my bet is the sound quality will be very unsatisfactory. Buy a tape adapter, I use one now with great success, and if you need to charge your iPod while driving look into the iGo system or something like it."
1,Monster Transmitter,"If you are looking for a device to play your Ipod music through your car radio, then ideally this would be the perfect gadget. Unfortunately, the Moster icarPlay wireless FM transmitter does not fit the bill. Tuning to the prescribed open channel limited by your geographical area can result in barely audible sounds. The static and bleeds from other channels makes this piece of technology worthless."
4,Good as any FM trasmitter can be,"Couple things to note:- You have it plugged into your car to power the transmitter (Doesn't use iPod battery power for transmission).- I use this on my commute in a major metro area and find that I have to change the channel while driving often. Yes, there are stations 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, 88.7, 88.9, 89.1, 89.3, and 89.5 (or stations are bleeding through 2 or 3 point channels).- I get a lot of noise with more vocal, ambient, or softer music. But if you listen to Rammstein or Skinny Puppy...no problem..."
3,"Does what it is supposed to do, but so do others","This FM transmitter does what it is supposed to do, but so do all the other FM Transmitters. For example, the Belkin transmitters (ranging in price depending on features) broadcast the same quality for about half the price. The quality cannot exceed that which would be seen in a 96 kbps mp3 because of the inherent limitations of FM radio. That is the same quality that all FM Transmitters broadcast at.So know going into your purchase that if you buy an FM Transmitter for your mp3 player or cd player that you will be limited to radio quality output. Secondly, know that if you are investing in the iCarPlay that you are paying for the name, the size, and the cigarette-lighter plug.Knowing that information, I'll leave you free to make your own conclusion and decision."
2,Shoddy engineering,"This unit comes with a hose that has a ""quick"" attachment and an adaptor to attach to a standard 1/4"" fitting. The ""quick"" attachment uses an exposed string/retainer clip which quickly came off and fell into the dark abyss below the sink when the hose was pushed through the mounting hole in the sink. Having lost the spring/retainer, tape was used to hold the ""quick"" attachment in place until a 1/4' - 1/2"" stainless steel hose clamp could be purchased. Note to manufacturer: if you are going to design a ""quick"" hose attachment, make a smaller version of the hydraulic or air hose quick attachments."
3,SlimQuick... Not so extreme,"I bought the SlimQuick Extreme after going through a bottle of the regular SlimQuick. I don't see the difference. I feel as if I have just as much energy as I did on the regular SlimQuick and don't seem to be losing weight any faster. I haven't changed my diet or exercise between the two and nothing has seemingly changed. In conclusion, while it is very effective, it is just as effective as the cheaper version of the regular SlimQuick---->SlimQuick-NxCare Female Fat Burner, 120 Capsules (New Improved Formula)"
4,So far so good,I've only been using this product for a week now but I do realize that I'm not as hungry as I was before I started taking it. I drink each pill with a full glass of water and I haven't experienced any shaking/ dizziness or any other side effects from it. I'll continue on taking these for the remainder of the package.
1,Complications Aren't Worth It!,"I bought these knowing that I should take the reviews with a grain of salt. The original SlimQuick worked just fine for me, so I bought these thinking that they might work a little better - boy, was I ever wrong! They induced vaginal bleeding, and I immediately stopped taking them. For me, this product was a waste of money."
2,painfully predictable,"Was Poe ever this obvious?Publish and Perish kept me entertained, but with cartoon-comic amusement, as each dropped hint landed like a lead anvil. Long before the last chapter of each story, the ending is apparent, with few, if any, twists along the way.The themes are clever, and the tales themselves clear, concise, and precisely painted. But the stories are populated with easy stereotypes who, in the end, are too blase about their fate. Half the fun of the Cask of Amontillado was savoring Fortunado's screams, wasn't it?Amusing enough for academics with tenure angst, but none of Poe's eerie, elegant, lingering evil."
3,"A case of ""borrowing"", something real academics might do.","Am I the first person to notice that the ""99"" story has a plot very much like that of the 1970's cult horror movie ""The Wicker Man""? I happened to see the film for the first time on the ""Flix"" channel on 3/7/09, As I watched I thought that this plot seemed familiar. The film was made at various scenic Scottish sites and includes nudity and sex. followed by horror. Perhaps others might spend time comparing both versions of the story.I consulted the ""Wicker Man"" website, which has a plot summary and a history of its being cut, spliced and restored over the years. Mr. Hynes is indeed a ""tv critic"" and a close student of film."
2,Not as I hoped,The binocs were not as they appeared in ad. Way too small field of view. Not a good purchase. I returned them the next day
4,Fresh new face?,"You can tell this guy is heavily influenced by Jack Johnson, G Love, and I think I hear a bit of Ben Harper in the mix too. His lyrics are a bit repetitive, but the music is good and any friend of Jack Johnson and crew is a friend of mine. Great new album!"
3,Not good enough,"The reasons for this CD to exist aren't good enough.First- Dennis doesn't have any lead vocals. Tommy does a really good job on his songs, but Dennis was the showman.Second- I don't notice an improvement in sound quality. Remastering a twenty five year old recording doesn't help my car stereo.Third- The song selection is uneven at best. 'Blue Collar Man' is a radio staple available on several compilations. 'Man in the Wilderness' is an underappreciated gem. 'Shooz' was forgettable and 'Heavy Metal Poisoning' falls flat.If you have the money buy the albums. If you just want what you hear on the radio buy 'Greatest Hits'. If you never want to hear 'Come Sail Away' again but want a Styx CD to play in your home system maybe this is your cup of tea."
2,Ego?,This Cd this nothing more then a ego massage from Tommy Shaw and JY. They act as if DDY was never in the Band. Skip this.
3,"Andy, where's my fifteen minutes?","Tin Machine was a hard rock band fronted by David Bowie, with Reeves Gabrels and Hunt & Tony Sales. Bowie and the band wrote all songs, other than a cover version of John Lennon's ""Working Class Hero"". It's a decent album, although Bowie's voice is buried in the mix. I hate to sound like an old fogey, but I like Bowie's early stuff better."
2,Appropriate name,"I love Bowie, but the music in Tin Machine is just so... harsh. Tin Machine is an appropriate name for it, more so than, say, heavy metal. I can easily listen to Heavy Metal, rock, hard rock, etc. but this stuff almost hurts my ears. It is not an easy listen, I'm afraid to say.Still, for hard core Bowie fans, You'll probably want to hear it at some point."
4,A fascinating portrait of the not so merry monarch,"Antonia Fraser clearly had a passion for this project, and it shows from the opening of the book right the way through the narrative. My only criticism is she uses tons of foreshadowing which gets rather irritating after a while, and the convoluted family tree can be a bit trying to have to deal with all the time.It could also do with an update using some newer sources, since it was published originally back in the early 1990s. Still, an impressive achievement and one that does not dismiss him as the 'merry monarch' he has often been depicted as. He was a brave survivor in a most tumultous age, and as she says, achieved things that James I and Charles I, this grandfather and father, scarcely ever dreamed of."
1,Left Center Right Collector's Tin,"I have been looking for this game ever since a friend introduced us to it.It is a fun game that is so simple the youngest can play along.HOWEVER, this particular set of dice is inferior. By the third game played, the dots had worn off. So, in the trash they will go. Very disappointed in this brand of dice. The symbols need to be etched into the dice, not merely stamped on. I would ask for a refund if the shipping was not such trouble!"
5,Unexpected delight.,"I bought this CD back in '96, a year or so after it was released, and delayed my purchase because I thought it wasn't a good Sanborn release. Unexpectedly, this CD really gives you some regular 'Sanborn-type' compositions, especially after the free formed and conceptual 'Another Hand', and the laid-back/ballads 'Pearls'. It was 'Another Hand's' disappointment which really kept me off 'Hearsay'. Upon my first listen, I realized that Sanborn was making a strong effort to regain his old audience with some upbeat tunes along with the production help again of Marcus Miller. 'Jaws' really lights up the joint and 'Long Goodbye', 'Little Face', and 'Back to Memphis', all have a strong blues influence which works really well. This one is worth a strong listen to."
4,Everything was OK,"Everything was OK with this purchase. The delivery time was fine, and the product was received in good shape."
1,Very disappointing replica,"Ok, so call me particular, but tell me why the picture of this piano, and the piano itself, and the picture of the piano on the box it came in all have the keyboard piece of crystal backwards??? Why does the ""black keys"" sit closer to the ends of the keys, and the ""white keys"" are towards the piano. Every picture I see, NOW THAT I LOOK all have the keyboards on backwards. Really, does no one else care that the keys are on backwards. I am so unhappy that someone didn't take the time to place the part correctly when they make these."
5,"well-adjusted person ""rocks"" out in this cd.","Maybe its my age. Or maybe I never ""got"" much 80's music. Cutting Crew, Paula Abdul, Culture Club,George Michael,Madonna. But there was the few that ROCKED. And this is one of them."
1,The Noose Hangs High,Not one of A&C's better works. Their performances are very flat and they are trying to force the laughs.
2,found many mistakes in it..,"Found many mistakes in this text.Sometimes the author usese detailed analysis, and sometimes the author usesly overly simplified approximations (which is not suitable at the community college level).The only colour you will see in this text is blue, and the font is so light too.Good book if you already know electronics inside out."
2,Nah don't even bother!,"nothing new, no original material. Seems to have been taken from 10 different books and abridged into one. Doesn't need to be in anyone's library."
2,Should come with warning on label. Silly stage props!!!,"Unfortunately, the people who filmed this put silly stage props, had T-Bone Walker playing on a fake porch with a woman knitting next to him and stuff like that. Real patronizing look at the blues. Too bad this is the way we have to remember these great artists. The performances were well done but hard to look at."
3,"Interesting, merely interesting","While I found the basic themes of this book interesting, I felt that the characters, the plot and the realization of the alien race of ""Dancers"" were lacking in depth or power. They were described but not brought to life.I therefore read through it to discover what happened, but was in no way gripped by it or compelled to become more involved in the story. I never did understand the ""souls in bottles"" phenomenon and found it simply a mechanical device to support the plot.The conclusion brought with it a feeling of hmmmmmm, okay. I much prefer a resounding AHA! or at least some tugging at my feelings and understanding.Interesting, merely interesting."
3,Show me the money,"Have only read bits and pieces but seems to explain things well. The best theory still needs to be helped by the cards, Wise choices through the understanding of this text"
5,YO THIS SHXT WAS DOPE!,I love old dirty bastard song it was great! I have all old dirty album all of them! That because I love old dirty bastard. I am the old dirty bastard fans. He was my favorite wu-tang clan and I support old dirty bastard from the wu-tang clan. I have love wu-tang clan for 5 years I had never hate wu-tang clan and old dirty bastard! never at once! I just never hate them I love wu-tang clan forever! I love all his song! I like track 1-17 all of them! He was a great rapper to me! I think y'all you [people]better get this ... album all of you will love dirty for real! and I want all ... police keeping ODB out of jail! Just let him free forever and let him make more album! I love dirty I hope he will gonna make 100 album in the future! I will just get it all! so peace for all wu-tang clan and please keep it real! WU-TANG HERE FOREVER!!!!
2,let's not fool ourselves this album isn't HOT,Yo with this album EVERYONE owns it....but how many people actually listen to it? First off that shows the albums worth. You'll be looking through your friends CD collection and you'll always see that bright yellow CD that gets NO stereo time. Brooklyn Zoo was the joint when it came out..and Shimmy Shimmy was cool. The Production on this album doesn't compare with the 36 chambers album or Meth's first one. Bottom line this album has no longevity...making it a mediocre album
2,pretty weak cd,"Its probably the worst cd made by anyone in Wu-Tang.The intro is funny and thats about it.The only decent songs on this cd were ones odb did with other people and they weren't even that good.If you want some Wu-Tang flavor get the 1st Method Man alblum,Tical.Its a lot better."
4,You want ...Entertainment..,ODB is the battery behind the Wu-Tang Clan. This MC always seems to have fun on the mic just as rap pioneers intended it to be. This album is hot! The production is cool and the lyrics are classic ODB rhymes.
5,Not just makeup - it's life,"When I first saw this book, I didn't think I'd appreciate it because I already had a step-by-step makeup book and another would just be an extra. However, I was very wrong: not only is this book extremely extensive, including topics about kodak moments, hair, fitness, self-esteem etc., but it had the most amazing makeup tips! I thought I heard everything and had mastered the art of makeup application, but apparantly I hadn't. I always drag this book around with me because Victoria Jackson is *so* inspiring, and has tips for everything. EVERYTHING. It's not just makeup, it's about ""making up"" your LIFE. Plus, it's just a gorgeous book with great photography. If you're gonna own only one makeup book, this should be it."
5,A correction of a 'correction'...,"This is NOT a review -- though I own the book in question, have only skimmed it so far, and venture to agree heartily with the glowing reviews I've read. I merely would like to respond to our friend, the reviewer from Canada, who was disturbed by what he/she thought was an 'error' in the author's SPELLING of his title. I certainly can't speak for all the rules of English spelling as taught or practiced in Canada, but, as a student of English in general, I can assure the troubled reviewer that ""Descartes' Error"" contains NO error in spelling. The reviewer is correct, of course, in stating that ""Descartes"" is not a plural noun; but the general rule for forming the possessive of any noun (including personal names) whose singular form ends in ""s"" is one which favors economy and simplicity: simply add an apostrophe (') to denote possession -- NOT an apostrophe AND another ""s"" -- as the title of this book correctly shows."
4,"Brain, Mind and Soul","I read this book shortly after leaving a religious group. This book did more than any other to show how the idea of a ""soul"" is an error at best, and that the solution to the ""mind/body problem"" is that the mind and body are, in essence, one thing. This book should be required reading for anyone who has ever even contemplated the idea that the ""mind"" is somehow separate from the body."
2,Wanted to love it but its poorly written.,"I read lots of these kinds of books by neuroscientists. I expect books like this to hold my attention. This one is so poorly written, I can hardly finish it. Sentences are not tight enough, the subjects keep shifting all over the place, the thesis is lost in the extraneous information. It's frustrating to not be sure if he's hiding the ball, waiting to reveal what was Descarte's Error or if he has already revealed it and is going to simply further drive home the point at the end. That should say it all, if you're not sure he's actually revealed what was Descarte's Error after he has actually hinted at it several times. Far from being too scientific, his writing style seems rambling. He might have great ideas, but he's not the best writer."
2,"A guide to emotions, rational thinking, and somatic markers","Damasio is most famously known for his 'somatic markers' hypothesis, which challenges Cartesian dualism and the separation between mind and body. This book gives a great guide to rational thinking and the effect of frontal lobe damage (think Phineas Gage), but its coverage of emotions and the psychoneurology of them is weak, at best. His somatic markers theory suggests that parts of the body elicit an emotional reaction which interfaces with the amygdala and limbic system, but provides very little real evidence. As such, it is often quoted as a brief footnote in introductory psychology texts, but very little more than that."
5,It works,"This is an opportunity to change the things you do not like in your life. It takes you step by step through each process. There is no rush, you proceed at your own pace."
5,Awesome Program,"Thanks Brook Noel for the CYLC. I am only on day 11 and I am amazed at the impact this challenge has made in my life. Brook's step by step method makes this ""doable"" for anyone.Try it- I don't think you'll be disappointed!"
4,nostalgia,"Although Anvil was never the best of bands, they still rocked back in the day and are great for nostalgic purposes. Originally released by Metal Blade Records. They even made a video for ""Mad Dog"" and played it regularly on MTV's Headbanger's Ball.Strength Of Steel was by far the best of the lot."
5,Buckwheat Kernal pillow,High quality product. This pillow provides superior to any other pillow I've ever used and is very comfortable.
5,"Organic Buckwheat Pillow - Twin/ Standard Size (20"" x 26"")","Well, I did not buy this for myself directly; this item was purchased for my wife. She would buy new pillows every few months as after a short time the pillows would give her a headache through the night. She wanted to try this one so I purchased it on November 16, 2011. I waited to report as I wanted he to have a month trial. The result so far, no headaches. She loves it and I will add every other month if I can the status. She says two thumbs up, 5 stars, no headache and excellent pillow. 12/22/11 report."
2,Very Uncomfortable!,"I tried this pillow for neck problems and it made my neck worse. It is too firm. I tried to return it, but the company, Beans72, did not make it easy and so they do not guarantee their pillow in any way."
1,Not worth the money...,I read the reviews online and decided to give this pillow a try. I am very disappointed because it has not alleviated any neck issues but has only made them worse (hence the 4:50am review). I don't know what the 'perfect' pillow is but considering I can barely move my neck this is most certainly not it.
1,My neck hurts,"This pillow is like sleeping on a rock. It is amazing that such a little husk can be so hard when put into a pillow case. I will try to return it, wish me good luck!"
2,What's the big deal?,"Why do the critics say what a great songwriter Freedy is? I don't get it. The opening track, ""Bad Reputation,"" is catchy, but the rest of the album is not even close. The songs are not bad, but they're not great either. They all sound alike and are not memorable at all. Ho hum."
3,Six Degrees of Separation,"I was expecting only music, not the conversations in the movie. I am going to listen to it while I'm in my car. Thanks!"
1,"this book is too old, bad...","before you guys buy the book you need, you have to check as well as possible, because some books will be very bad, old..."
4,SUMMARY,"Robin and his friends help recover a missing dachshund that belongs to the new neighbor, a girl that's moved to cost to try and learn to walk again after contracting polio."
5,Legalized Dope!!!,"Hands down best Hip-Hop album of its era. Unfortunately, also the most overlooked and slept on as well. News flash! Real Hip-Hop is gone with the start of the Puffy Pop era and everybody doin it for the dollar and not for the cause. Biggie and 2Pac the world greatest rappers, please! You need to reach back further my friends, Tribe Called Quest, Gang Starr, Big Daddy Kane, Main Source, EPMD, Brand Nubian, true pioneers in the game.This is and was probably one of the last real hip hop albums you will ever hear like its kind. I got 3 copies, house, car or shower I am still playing all cuts all the time, and it seems like yesterday. The raw samples combined with CL's energy and lyrical content cannot be matched. I got made fun of back in the day, cause I am from LA, and my boys were all listening to the West Coast Crap, I stayed true to what I liked, they just didn't know, real hip-hop was born in the east."
4,Great Album for a Road Trip,"I grew up on hip hop, but I rarely listen to new stuff. A friend recommended this old-school album and it did not disappoint. Although no single track stands out for me as a legendary song, this is a fantastic album to listen to straight through. No songs should be skipped. Great album for a road trip."
3,"Unpretentious and catchy,","""Velvet Elvis"" was commandeered as the name of a late '80s/early `90s band from Kentucky consisting of Dan Trisko (guitar, vocals), Scott Stoess (bass, vocals), Sherri Magee (drums, vocals) and Jeff Yurkowski (keyboards, vocals). This self-titled release was produced, mixed, and recorded by Mitch Easter.The music is unpretentious and catchy, and this CD will perk things up on a road trip even if it may not garner attention if blaring at a party. The musicians sound poised and confident, on the brink of that big break that never came, a story repeated countless times.The awful CD booklet, save the front cover, did the band no favors."
3,Will the real Roland please stand up?,"Judith Tarr mixes Merlin, the *Song of Roland* and the myth of the madman of the forest together in a romance that is more romantic than historical. This gives her the chance to create several Rolands: warrior, lover, shapechanger, Carolingian loyalist, madman of the woods, and reluctant champion-king. Character motivation is weak, especially for the distrust of Sarissa (who would not be allowed the freedom she exhibits in a real Carolingian setting). Nor would a woman of her time necessarily sleep with someone she does not trust completely. A slow read, it picks up in spots, and she has a gift for description, but I had to push myself to finish. Why is Tarr considered a queen of historical fiction? I don't see it. She offers a mish-mash of ill-defined magic, over-romanticized characters, and idealized history with a New Age bent."
4,Beautiful but not perfect,"I have read other reviews for this recordings, and all of them seem to think that this is the best of all: true, O'Conor really plays the sonatas well, but the reviewers have not heard Vladimir Ashkenazy.I think that Ashkenazy is the true genius of Beethoven performance. His sonatas are so well-played and with so much feeling that it brought tears to my eyes when I listened to the Moonlight Sonata. The Appassionata is played with so much vivacity and crispness that it astounded me."
2,"This Requiem is ""pressured"" and played much too fast.","This rendition of Mozart's Requiem has given in to the idea that it must be played ""as fast as possible,"" in order to display the instrumentalist's techniques. (Requiem means rest.) At the other extreme is the rendition a few years ago by Leonard Bernstein which was much, much too slow in tempo. In my opinion as a non-musician, lay person, the best recording of Mozart's Requiem I've heard is that of Herbert von Karajan in 1976, by Deutsch Grammophon Gesellschaft. Tom Bauer"
5,Made me hot!,"I read the book and it made me hot. My girlfriend read the book after I did and she thought is was real intelligent. It kind of reminded me of the Penthouse Letters. I like reading them a lot. My girlfriend said that the book reminded her of Dostoyevski if he had been into S&M. I had a hard time understanding the big words but I liked the pictures. If you like porno or like fine literary works, then I think you will like this book. Another thing, my eyes aren't too good and the pictures were real big so I could see them. The paper in the book was pretty thick I think."
3,Maybe I Expected Too Much...,"AN ENGLISH MURDER was chosen (by me) to be read by my book group, after a good review of it in the Cincinnati Enquirer. I was disappointed. I'm not a frequent reader of ""English mysteries,"" so I can't compare and contrast this book to all the other mysteries I've read. It's just that I was left wondering where the ""mystery"" was. The identity of the murderer was obvious from the start. It's not a ""whodunnit."" Where this book did succeed was in slowly revealing that the citizens of a seemingly pleasant little English village are not as quaint as their surroundings...everyone has dark and often slimy secrets in their past. As the weather turned gloomy and characters' conscious and unconscious motives were uncovered, the book just went sort of grim. If you're looking for a classic mystery with dead ends and plot twists, AN ENGLISH MURDER isn't it. If you're looking for a character study of the dark side of people's souls, you'll find those secret corners here."
5,Hey NyQuil Driver...,"Contrary to what Dave Henderson may happen to think - I don't find John Henry repetitive at all. TMBG's music has a great quality that makes it medeocre at first glance, but the more you listen to it, the sweeter it gets, and the more hooked on it you become.The plethora of sounds and never-ending pile of quirky subject matter that TMBG has at their disposal is always interesting to listen to, at the very least and many times borders on musical genius. (In my humble opinion).If you liked ""Lincoln"" or ""Apollo 18"" or even if you got into TMBG more recently with ""Flood"" - you'll be able to appreciate the material on John Henry."
3,Peppy competence in spades rarely achieves more,"Coming across as a lighter, nerdier Ween, this mid-career disc from the super quirky duo certainly is not short on bursts of hooky pop with just enough songwriting flair to perk jaded ears, though few of John Henry's 20 tracks transcend the geeky confines this nasally pair has cultivated. Usually what makes this more for fans then initiates would be the goofy brand of humor attached to nearly all the lyrics."
3,The Weakest Effort...but still good.,"John Henry is a strange album. The first half is excellent and the 2nd half is lukewarm. Subliminal, the opening track, is an excellent song and starts the lunacy right away by talking about getting hit by a car. The horns add excitement to Sleeping In The Flowers between the tempo changes. And the rest of the 10 opening tracks are catchy. Now the last songs just never clicked with me. I usually enjoy every song on every TMBG effort, but the remainder of this album is a bore to me. Maybe over time I will rediscover these tunes, but for now, this album remains the weakest entry. However, as a fan, you should own this album, especially for the opening track."
4,fit just right,"I mean, what can I say folks.. their wheel studs. how can you not make these right huh.. I put them on, they fit..walla"
2,Not useful for professional use,"I make cabinets for a living and thought these would be a good choice based on price, flexibility and experience with other Freud products. They may be OK for a hobbyist, but if you rely on these to make money you'll spend too much time on set up and find that some of the profiles won't allow you to put the finished doors through your drum or wide belt machine. Freud tech support was very helpful, but agreed they couldn't meet my needs with this product."
1,4GB USB Storage Drive,Broke in less than a year and had only been used twice. Company would not replace or reimburse without original receipt and packaging. I find this unreasonable.
3,Sassy to big,"This item must be made more for a older kid. It was not at all for a small child. The anklet was bulky. And made for mKing music with or something, not for daily wear as I had wanted."
1,Filled With Useless Information,"If you want to wade through useless babble to get to the actual cost accounting, go at it. However, you'll probably buy this book anyway if you have an unscrupulous accounting professor who received a gift basket from the publisher.In other words, it's useless to the student. However, I'm sure its very profitable for the publisher and the authors."
2,Not Impressed!,"I was unfortunate to have had to use this textbook for two semesters. It was pure torture! Although there is learning value to this book, there are also many things that make you want to tear your hair out. My main issue is with the graphic illustrations. There are quite a few, but I have not found one that is useful in any form. Some graphs don't even label what is being shown, just a line usually. I wish my ""favorite"" graph could be explained in words.Like I said, this book does also teach you about the subject so it is not all bad, but I have used a different cost management text that was much better than this one."
2,Hype !!!,"There was a lot of hype around this old trilogy (written close to ten years ago) and that's what it is hype, and that&#65533;s what left hype. It was maybe good back then, when there was no WH40K novels, but now, out of 30 novels, the whole trilogy is at the bottom of the lines, they're is a few intersting part, but the story line change to much, without saying why, and nothing is never explained, you&#65533;re always why? what? when? And how long is that boring story going to last.The world is dead, and taste like ash, everything is dark, evil, it is hard to understand, even for a fan. The author change the story line like I change my hair style, without a reason, just for fun. It&#65533;s respectable for back then, and maybe worth reading for hardcore fan, but don&#65533;t expect too much. Without the hype I would give 3 stars, but because of the hype I gave it 2 stars."
2,So-So does the job - Avoid,"This is an OK product, but it could be better. When using you need to make sure that you use a cooking spray, otherwise the egg will stick and burn, the next issue is the rim height. Even for a medium egg a lot of the white escapes over the narrow rim. This makes for a very thin egg, if you are trying to make your own Mc muffins, etc. Mine had a very rough edge at the weld joint that rips the egg white ,then when I sanded it smooth, there was a void, or bubble in the weld that the egg sticks to, even when Pam'd."
1,Attractive Product But Inaccurate,"Colorful and easy to read which will appeal to children. But, for a major atlas publisher to let pass the statement ""Paris, in France, is Europe's largest city"" is inexcusable."
3,loud and broke quickly,"pluses - feels solid good verbal commands, realistic sirens, plenty of lights and sounds to keep kids busy.negative - firetruck broke in 3 months. no longer runs even with new batteries. screw on battery door was a pain to open - screw just turn without coming out. It was like when I open it up first time too."
1,Weak on Content and Technique,Very disappointed in the quality of technique and content of this book. I had high expectations based on the reviews and was surprised that this book had very little value. I returned for a partial refund and did not bother reading the entire book.
2,Simple Cheerleading.,"The title is promising, for people who realize the value of branding at the organizational level. Unfortunately, the authors borrow some exceptional ideas from other thought leaders, and then fail to do anything inspired with them. Instead of jumping into the game with some original ideas, the book reads like a series or obvious case studies, and RAH! RAH! championing of real work, done by real people, with real experience. If you subscribe to HBR, or keep astride of the WS Journal, you can't help whiz through this book and think, ""I've read this before, but by someone else."""
4,Great knife set!,"I compared several different knife sets online and decided to purchase this one based on the reviews, price, and the appearance. I am so glad I bought them! Great knives, love that the scissors come apart so that you can clean them. Nothing like cutting with a GOOD sharp knife!!"
4,ladder review,"The telescoping ladder is extremely portable and easy to use. I would recommend this ladder for people who are getting older, have problems carrying heavy or bulky items or for use in confined spaces. Care must be taken when lowering the steps to avoid pinching."
1,A Rather Strange And Un-Scientific Approach!,"Licking Therapy? Holding therapy to cure Autism? Where is the scientific research and theory? This was a very bizarre book and, after listening to her talk at a conference, even more controversial and strange. Unaccepted in the medical community and too ""new wave"" or ""old wave "". No logical method. I think this book is only for the desparate. Some good insights but not a recommended treatment as it is just too off the wall."
3,It grows on you...,"I like a lot of Ween's early output, but what I don't like, I really don't like. Their early sound was abrasive and raw. I don't mind the rawness, it's actually kind of charming, but some of the instrumentals only sound good if you're blasted. This is a quintessential drug album, and my impression is that that was the attempt; to create an album that sounded like you were already on drugs. Like most of their early output, the music is more interesting than entertaining."
4,"Powerful, powerful, powerful...","...for any man who has ever been abused, or anyone who loves such a man, this book is a must. It progressively defines abuse, the abused's recognition of it, how as an adult it defines him and his relationships with others, and how he deals with his recovery. The real-life testimonies included in the book put all of the matter-of-fact information into personal perspective.Two themes which are reinforced throughout are that recovery is a process, not an event, and requires a lot of work; and, that one can ultimately redirect their emotional energy away from hate, anger and doubt to more productive uses, which will aid and reinforce the healing process.The book is not very long and is an interesting read from the start. I would highly recommend it to all counselors."
5,Press On---Cohon brings McDonalds to Russia,"George Cohon gives an honest account of the years of meetings, negotiations, disapointments and eventual victory associated with bringing McDonalds to Russia.A testament to the human side of successful business negotiation."
3,An Essential Supplement,"This product does nothing on it's own, as as soon as the body builds up cartilage, the body breaks it down again, so it's only good with a COX-2 inhibitor like Curcumin or Turmeric root extract, or D-Flame by NOW foods, which also together made a noticeable reduction in pain from my arthritis. It's too early to tell if this MSM is actually replacing cartilage that I've lost, but we'll see in the next few months or so. I have tried over 15 joint-relief products in the last year, since I'm taking every supplement I can to postpone surgery. MSM is only one piece to the joint-relief puzzle, but on it's own it does nothing."
4,Great Stuff,"This book is great stuff for Enterprise Architects. The discussion of Zachman is better than any of the Zachman Institues articles. The explanation of the value of architectural meta-models is excellent.On the down side, the meta-models presented are very good EXCEPT that the author still presents data as being a part of an application. Surely 20 or so years after James Martin we are past that. Applications with their own data schemata are to be avoided and suppressed, rather than endorsed.If your are a ""real"" Enterprise Architect, then this is book indispensable, but review all of the meta-models carefully to insure that they comply with your particular religion."
5,Excellent product,This is an excellent GPS for the price. The route recalculation is great and really quick on it. We have used it a lot! It has already paid for itself. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a cheap affordable GPS.
5,Excellent value,"I bought this for $150 from Staples on black friday. I've been thrilled with the quality and accuracy. I've used this in southern CA where I live and in Houston, TX where I travel for business. The unit has worked beautifully in both places. The database of ""POI"" or points of interest is very good. My only criticism is that the unit can sometimes be a little confusing when approaching a split in the highway. Otherwise, I've been very pleased with its directions. The speaker is plenty loud and it's adjustable. The built in MP3 player is fine but I rarely use it because it plays through 1 speaker. There is a headphone jack but I haven't tried it yet. I highly recommend this product!"
2,Relatively inexpensive for a reason,"This may have been the first GPS that is priced cheaply enough that pretty much everyone can afford to have a GPS in their car. Note I didn't say a ""good"" GPS because the unit I had bought kept losing satellite signal in the middle of Seattle. I would ignore the directions and would take what I knew surely to be a shortcut and the GPS would be completely oblivious for a FEW minutes! It got to be so useless that I didn't keep it for more than 3 days. Back it went to the store.Mio has brought back the old dictum that I thought no longer applied to commoditized technology, namely, you get what you pay for!"
3,Purchased and returned.,"I bought this system to test it out and have returned it in exchange for a more expensive Pioneer unit. Although my Pioneer does not have as many worthless options, it is precise and accurate. The Mio was instructing me to make illegal left turns when I was required to make a right and utilize a jug handle. The absolute #1 criteria for a GPS system should be accuracy. This thing often told me to ""turn around"" when I missed a turn. I dont know many states where you can just ""turn around"", especially here in NJ!! Inaccurate directions potentially cause accidents, a risk I am not willing to take. My suggestion is to buy the unit with a no risk return policy, in case you have the same opinion."
2,My experience in 30 minutes !,"In just 10 minutes out the box and my brand new Mio 310x was not working !!! I could check some functions and it was working well but suddenly, the screen froze and the device didn't answer my commands. I turned it off manually. When I turned it on again the navigation function was not working.Apparently, the software that manages the US Map is corrupted (that what the FAQ into the Mio's website says. I tried to reinstall it, but it is not a simple operation.)Besides that, my Mio cannot read my SD Card (in spite of the fact that this latter is working properly in my computer and my dig. camera).....so, 2 big problems in just 10 minutes!Well, I spent another 10 minutes writing an email to Mio and I hope that tomorrow they have a solution to my case and another 10 minutes writing this review .So...all that happened just 30 minutes ago.....Note: The seller was great ! Delivered in just 2 days !"
1,horrible,"I wonder if I received the same items as the other reviewers. It seems clogged from the beginning, will not keep pressure, so does not work at all right out of the box. HORRIBLE"
1,The zippers are not a bonus; they ruin the line of the shirt,"The zippers on this shirt are stiff - despite washing - and ruin the line of the shirt. I can't bring myself to wear it in public, which rather defeats the purpose."
5,Excellent Insight and Information,I found this book to be full of helpful and interesting facts and insights into a people I consider to be fascinating and inspiring.
3,"Good moisturizer, unsure of authenticity","This moisturizer works better than my neutrogena. It feels silkier and less heavy. It is half the price of neutrogena too, so I think it is a good bargain. However, it came in a container that is difficult for you to get a small amount without ""contaminating"" the rest of the product. It was not properly sealed, in my opinion. So I don't know if that is how L'Oreal intended its packaging, or if it has already been tampered with. I also wonder if it's really supposed to be yellowish (in contrast to most moisturizers that I have tried, which are white), so I don't know if it's a really old stock or what. For those who are sensitive about the things they apply on their face, I would not recommend this product. They'd be better off buying from the mall, save yourself the worries."
4,great product horrible bottle design,"I would give this a five stars if it wasnt for the way the bottle is designed. The product itself is very light, moisturizing, and feels nice on the skin, which is all great. It doesnt smell and is a good value for the price. However, as nice as the bottle looks, it is difficult to handle. the bottle is so hard that you have to actually really press and put strength on it to squeeze the product out, even when it is full. as a result, you are usually left with more moisturizer than you need for your face, which is a waste. However, i have found that the opening is big enough to put the content back in."
5,A colorful and accurate picture of a great city,"I knew the Shanghai that Stella Dong describes as a child and adolescent growing up there. She captures the surreal quality of this unique world amazingly well. Reading ""Shanghai"" brought it all back--the ""sweetly-sick"" odor of opium in the side streets, the blind beggars and the gangsters who used to knock on the door of our house in the French Concession for ""protection money."" What I especially like is Dong's even-handedness. She writes about this Chinese city from neither a purely Western nor a Chinese point-of-view. This is the best of the books available about Shanghai. I hope everyone interested in exploring China's recent past will read this book because they'll learn a great deal about the forces that shaped China today from understanding the underpinnings of this astonishing place."
2,As Muddy As the Whangpu,"Alas, despite the enticing title and initially engaging, gossipy style, this book bogs down in repetitive trivial details while failing to explore fasciniting topics to which it alludes (such as the international drug trade in the early 20th century and its links to Shanghai and to international arms trading after WWI). Little effort is made to identify individuals as they reappear in subsequent chapters or to present a coherent historical narrative. This is one of the very few books I have ever simply chosen to put down rather than finish."
2,Cheap Packaging,"Product works well as expected in that I have purchased a Peueot Pepper Mill 15 years ago, and it's still works well. What caused the low rating was the cheap packaging that was given to the two mills I ordered. They well not wrapped or in individual boxes and placed in an oversized box with a few air packages. The mills were free to bounce around and apparently hit each during shipment. One mill has a large nick in the black finished. Just didn't feel like going through the hassle of the returning process. Why package 2 expensive items as if your shipping 2 rocks."
1,Stay far away if using with a Toshiba,"Purchased to use with a Toshiba Satellite S173. Computer locked up anywhere from immediately to around an hour when using the Linksys WPC11. After doing a little research (which I should have done in the first place) it turns out that there is a history of trouble with this card and Toshiba laptops. I like my Linksys wireless router, but the network card continued to cause problems and has since been returned. My advice is to stay away from this card if you have a Toshiba laptop."
2,"Five star start, one star finish","I installed a v.3 card in my Sony Vaio about 9 months ago. The installation and operation on XP home was flawless and if I reviewed the product then, I would have given it a 5 star review. However, the signal pick-up on the card has been diminishing over time - areas that had started out with a strong signal, now register as low. Finally the card stopped working completely. Right now the card only picks up a signal if it is placed right next to the WAP11 and then dies within 10 minutes. This would get one star right now if it weren't for the Linksys techie that tried to talk me through the problem, then suggested a replacement card."
1,Doesn't work with NT,"If you have an NT machine, keep looking. I couldn't even get the configuration utility to load..."
1,Poor Range and installation,"I ordered DWL-650 with DI-713P based on the features. The first DWL650 had very poor range, would not work more than 30 feet away with two walls in between in my home. And the second card would not even install on my W2K machine. It keeps saying unknown pcmcia device ( I did not have problem with my first card though) and would not load dwl-650 driver for it. To me, the range is useless, and the tech support is helpless. Avoid this product if you can."
5,It was easy to install,"I don't think of myself as a 'network wizard'. I opened the box, put the CD-ROM in, plugged the card in and let the install process run when it detected the new card I directed it to look for the driver on the CD-ROM. I never looked in the manual (it is still unopened in the box), tried a few settings and it started communicating with my wireless network (I ended up with it set to ""infrastructure""). Very Cool!"
1,Poor distance with Linksys Network PC Card,"I bought the Linksys WPC11 Wireless Network PC card to use in my home network with the Linksys dsl/cable ethernet switch & 802.11b wireless access point. While the card works and installs easily, its distance coverage is abysmal and is nothing like what is advertised. I thought the problem might be with the access point, but when I tried another card from another manufacturer, the results were dramatically better. Linksys support is awful--you can wait for hours waiting for their help line."
2,BEWARE THE VERSION NUMBER,"Linksys uses the same number WPC11 for all of their cards, and then updates the version number. Their support only goes up to version 3, but they are selling version 4. The newer version contains an entirely different chipset, and is not compliant with linux."
2,Linksys Wireless Card,"At first, this item worked relatively well and it was relatively easy to install. However, suddenly, from one day to the next, my drivers stopped functioning, therefore, the Wireless card stopped functioning. It has been a burden on my shoulders never working when I need it to work. I would recommend something else, stronger and more durable."
1,Range is Horrible!,"Ok, folks, I decided to buy a Linksys Router and PC card.I live in a 1 bedroom apt and the range was simply terrible.I would think that the two items from the same company would have been exceptional, but it was not.After about 75 feet the network was unreachable with this card and companion router (access point).I took the card to work and had the same problems.I would suggest you look at another card.I returned mine."
4,"Works great, no problems","I got this to interface with the Linksys 802.11b WAP; the laptop is a Dell Inspiron 5000 series. Setting up the card was a breeze, since Windows XP autorecognizes the card. The only information you need to enter is the WEP key (if you are using one), and it is going. Reception is fine all over the house, and I don't see any difference in speed when compared to plugging directly into the DSL modem (DSL maxes out at about 600 Kbps, and the 802.11b can handle 11 Mbps--order of magnitude over the best DSL can do). There is also little effect on the battery life, which can be an issue for some cards. All in all, it makes wireless easy and efficient."
3,"Good tech support, but still can't get it to work in XP","It worked fine for Windows 2000, but not for the WinXP SP1 on my Toshiba laptop. If not for the responsiveness of the tech support on a weekend, I would give it 1 only star. I was on the phone for more than 1 hour; I already tried everything that they suggested prior to calling them. Still cannot get it to work - I returned it the next day."
1,Linksys Wireless pcmcia card wpc-11,"Ordered this item on 2/6/02, then noticed that it would not be shipped untill Feb.13,2002. This was very unacceptable, so I had to cancel this order and buy the item locally at a higher price.Very unsatisfactory I feel."
4,IT works!,"It works. My laptop runs XP and the first attempt to install failed because XP couldn't ""find the card"". I turned off the machine and restarted it, all went well after that. So my reccomendation is, do not read the instructions, put the card in, start the machine and let XP drive."
2,robertp,The notebook adapter interfaced with my laptop with no problems. My issue with the wireless adapter is the receiver is not very sensitive and it keep drooping the signal from my wireless hub (from one room to another about 30 feet from the hub). Not sure you can do much better. If your buying check the sensitivity of the receiver. Good luck
1,Not having much luck,"I purchased this card (V. 4) as part of a kit that also contains the BEFW11S4 V 3.2. It was a little tempermental at first but worked ""fair"". After a few weeks however, it went downhill from there. It started getting time outs when trying to load web pages, then refused to connect to the internet at all. I've tried everything from formatting the laptop, reinstalling the firmware on the router to reinstalling the software on the laptop (several times). Once in a while it works; MOST of the time it doesn't work at all. All the while my wired pc works great. I've also been into computers for several years and have quite a bit of experience with networking. Very disappointed as I've had linksys products before and they worked very well."
1,Dissapointed,"Purchased this product and never recieved it, money was refunded but I am still unhappy."
1,Not there yet,"I built a small wireless network using the WAP11, the WUSB11, and the WPC11. After hacking through the install, being demeaned by Linksys technical support, they finally admitted that the WPC11 ""DOES NOT WORK"" with the WAP11. They say that they need a firmwire upgrade on the WAP11 to get things straightened out. Whatever it is, the whole system is flakey at best, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, at best it's a [gamble].I have purchased many Linksys products over the years and have had nothing but great success. The wireless products just aren't there yet, don't waste your time or money."
4,Wireless Laptop Network Adapter,"Easy to install, just accept defalts, works all over house at 80--100% signal strength and signal quality. Make sure you get version 2, 2.5 or 3. The earlier version was no damn good."
2,Lousy range,"Installed almost flawlessly. Range stunk though so I returned it and bought a Lucent Orinoco which has awesome range,"
1,The range!!!,"Easy setup, good manual. Very dissapointing range when combined with LinkSys wireless access point. At the distance of about 21 feet the signal strength was down to 60%(through one wall). I returned it promptly and got neatgear pc wireless card and access point."
2,"Linksys Wireless PCMCIA Card, good card, awful support","I bought this card and the Linksys Wireless Router w/ 4 Port Switch to access my business VPN. Basically, even though the boxes say it supports VPN when you speak to the techs they are clear that the current firmware does not. You will have to downgrade to a version which works but is buggy and that's the best they can do.NOTE THAT IT TOOK 5 CALLS TO GET A CORRECT RESOLUTION FROM LINKSYS FROM THEIR TECHS. WASTED MANY HOURS."
1,Make Sure You Get Version 2.5,"Make sure you get version 2.5 of this card if you need it for a PDA or Windows XP. I had much trouble with older version of the card presented on this site. The new version of the card has the Linksys logo on the exposed end.""black end"""
2,Limited range makes it unusable!,"I bought and installed this card with the Linksys 802.11b wireless router on a Win98 laptop. I wanted to have some mobility around the house. The installation went OK and I had a connection sitting at a desk 1 meter away from the AP. But as soon as I took the laptop and went to the bedroom (~15meters), the connection was lost. It didn't even work in the hallway to the office room. I had to return the card, but kept the router. I'm still looking for a card replacement. Want to try Orinoko or Cisco, but the local stores don't have them and I'm wary of wasting the shipping charges online again."
3,a so-so wireless card,"I bought a Linksys Wireless AP+4 port switch and it works well. This Linksys card works with it also. But after reviewing the reivews for Linksys PC ard and Netgear PC card I decided to try Netgear also. Yes Netgear does better than Linksys. I used to get fair, sometimes no singal at upstaires. But with Netgear (WA401) it's always good connection! I strongly recommend Netgear plus Linksys AP! (As for AP, I also tried D-link 713P. I even tried 2 of them and none of them worked. It had cost me 8+ hours before I tried the Linksys, which plug and play!)"
2,Tough to setup and bad support,"I bought a Wireless router and Wireless card WPC11 from Linksys. Router is working fine. But the PC card is a piece of junk. I have Windows 2000 on Toshiba laptop. Initially it didn't installed drivers. I tried for 10times without luck.Try to install drivers first and if it is not successful again double click the Newtork card in device manager and slect update driver. Don't select automatically select suitable driver. Select the other option ""Display a list of the known drivers for this device so that I can choose a specific driver"" and in the next screen don't bother anything, just choose have disk and put the CD and select ""D:\wpc11\win2000"". It worked for me this way. And the speed is also good. Support for the product is bad. Min 30min waiting time."
1,Make him stop!,I can't believe this guy even has a recording contract. He is completely without talent and just plays a bunch of machines that any 15 year old with an IQ of 80 can operate. This music is some kind of bad joke.
3,my cat was not cooperative,"I have a long-haired cat who is prone to matting, but I found the comb not to be particularly helpful in removing the mats without being clawed."
5,great product and great price,"We have a mini-golden doodle who gets mats frequently and this brush has been able to get out all of the tangles and mats that her other, more expensive comb has not. It removes tangles without hurting her and is able to get all of the mats out we would normally have to cut out because we hadn't been able to get them out with our normal brush in the past. It works great on her legs and neck, which are often usually difficult to brush as well. I'd recommend this brush to anyone and if for some reason this comb ever breaks or gets lost I will definitely be purchasing another. The fact that this was so cheap is just a bonus for how great a job it does!"
4,This works,I have used this on the mats on my rough coat collie. It has been very effective. I use a grooming spray on the mats and then use this to remove them.
1,Dissatisfied,"Like many others, my perfume turned yellow as well. I think it only happens with the atomizer. Perhaps exposure to air SOURED the perfume. I am throwing it away as soon as possible because it no longer smells good. The product was bought for me as a gift and it came in a huge set. I am disappointed and sad that my friend spent about 60 dollars for a cheap product with a short shelf-life. I am never buying perfume from Britney Spears. Obviously the makers of the perfume did not perform enough quality control tests before releasing the perfume."
5,quality,my wife loves to smell good all the time even right when she gets out of the shower. she has been wearing this perfume for many years. i used to wait for it to go on sale at Walgreens but now its even easier to get on amazon.
1,wrong item shipped,"The wrong perfume was packaged and shipped. Paperwork was all correct though. The kicker is that perfume is classified as hazardous materials, so I could not ship it back. After a few headaches, I was able to reach a real person and a credit was issued. Good for Amazon for stepping up."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT!!!,THIS SELLER WAS VERY QUICK AND PROMPT WITH THE DELIVERY. NOT TO MENTION I LOVE MY PRODUCT. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING SO LONG AND HARD AND NOW I FOUND IT. I DO PLAN TO DO BUSINESS AGAIN :)
3,Pleasant Enough,"A pleasant score. Fine singing, especially the wonderful Liz Callaway. The score, however, doesn't have those one or two numbers that stand out and stop you in your tracks. I haven't seen the show, and perhaps when integrated with the text....."
2,From the Cape to Cairo by Ewart Grogan,"A very well bound book,and, considering the age of the original,well printed.I was disappointed with the quality of the pictures--which I am sure could have been better copied-being vey dark, and in some cases completely indistinguishable.However, for the price, it was a reasonable buy.Did not appreciate having to pay our greedy customs for a new book !!Perhaps I can find an original copy,which will not require import duty?Hopefully!!"
4,"Good book, except for the Santa spoiler","My 10-year-old son greatly enjoyed this classic story of Lou Gehrig's childhood. It is an engaging story of inspiration and hard work. However, there is a Santa spoiler in the first chapter that could create a very big problem for some younger children and their beliefs. I"
4,"A 1990's ""Quiet Storm"" Classic!! 4.5 out of 5 stars.","I have to disagree with Amazon's reviewer on this one. There is nothing skeevy or remotely vulgar about this album. Simply put, this is sensual, LOVE-making music at its best. What distinguishes ""Surrender"" from sleazy/cheesy ""sex-music"" are the fabulous voices of the Kut Klose ladies. These ladies can ""SANG""!! The group-members' harmonies blend together so well that, at times, it almost seems like there's one vocalist rather than three. Kut Klose was part of the bygone R&B ""slow-jams"" phase of the mid-1990's, where all-female groups like En Vogue, SWV, Xscape and Changing Faces dominated the charts with their fabulous vocals and harmonizing. Is their music sexy? Sure. But there's nothing wrong with getting sexy with the one you LOVE. And that's what sets ""Surrender"" apart from the much of the soul-less, trashy music that passes for R&B nowadays. If you're a fan of sensual, soulful slow-jams, then Kut Klose's ""Surrender"" is a must-have!"
4,Athena Cage,"I was in love with Athena cage when this cd (cassette) came out. It had some pretty good cuts on it but in 2008, I would not suggest picking it up. You can pick and choose which songs you want to download from like itunes or something. It's a classic but not all that to spend money on in the 08. NEOSOUL06."
1,This product is blowing air,"Mine was blue not red and I did a double take when I examined it. It looks like 2 halves of the ocarina were hastily sonic welded together leaving a jagged seam full of air gaps. It leaked so much air it was difficult to produce any tones and it was inconsistent. Blowing into a coke bottle was more enjoyable, louder, and more musical than using this ocarina. Get one made of clay."
5,Still not through being cool,"Whoever is below me and said Dave and Ted's song writing is at its best is actually incorrect. Ted and Dave debuted on through being cool, Anthony Anastacio and Justin Gaylord were the guitar players on Cant Slow Down. Besides Chris and Bryan, all other members were replaced and through being cool came out.Anyway this cd isnt as creative as its sophomore release, ""Through Being Cool,"" but its still saves the day, and it is still amazing. More of the hardcore edge like their even earlier recordings (featured on ""ups and Downs"" cd, where Chris was still only 16 when they recorded a few of those songs), and by going in order, each saves the day record gets moderatly slower with each release, with the exception of Sound The Alarm, which is yet another milestone for STD by the way. Nonetheless, this cd is catchy and worth whatever you spend on it."
5,Catchy Boston Punk,"I was amazed when I heard Saves the Day. The guitar is heavier than traditional punk, and the vocals less nasal. They lyrics are great, and the songs don't get old....BUY THIS CD!"
3,not bad,"This is a pretty good album. It's the first album I've bought from Saves the Day, and I can definitely say they have an original sound. They are in between pop-punk and emo. I like the fact that unlike all emo bands their lyrics go farther than just talking about crying over a broken relationship. The reason I rated it with 3 stars is because I like to listen to more punkier band, but otherwise it's a good album, and if you're into emo, it's a must buy."
5,Seductive mix of melodies,Elegant combination of songs with various interesting tempos. Wonderful for background music during dinners or when relaxing with a glass of wine and friends.
4,"Love, melancholy and kinda things that make us linger...","That is the kind of tune that i always wanted to hear and perform on and off stage. Particularly the feelings of the tracks nr4 and nr7 are very -I can not find a word to describe, may be hypnotizing- as a devoted listener and performer to me. Best of it`s category, ever since the incredible couple K & D`s compilations. I wonder why didn`t i rate 5 star, but i must be waiting for something better, may be..."
5,Back Stretch Appliance,Delivery of product was faster than expected. Product is used by my wife who has chronic back problems. It works fine!
2,This does nothing for me,Purchased because I had a bout of achilles tendonitis. Very unstable little bugger and I feel that one has to have serious balance and lean against a wall to flex their bad foot and ankle. Not expensive so it will just collect dust. Did stretching excercise in the shower and for about 2 mins my foot felt great. Did this for 2 months and the achilles tendonitis went away. SO much for this little booger of an item.Probably should try it sitting down? Not sure if that will have the same affect?
2,MediDyne calf stretcher,The item was smaller than I anticipated and because of it's small size it limits my ability to adequately stretch my calves. I wouldn't recommend this product for anyone medium sized or larger.
3,Not for me,"I purchased this product after looking at other reviews and reading how this product helped other buyers with Plantar Fasciitis.I have to say that Pro-stretch works as expected, and you feel an excellent calf muscle stretch by standing on it. It's very easy to use with proper balancing and I am tempted to use it every now and then.However, it doesn't help with Plantar Fasciitis for me. In fact, I have noticed that my heel pain gets worse after stretching with this product. I have stopped using Pro-stretch because it doesn't work for my condition. I shared this with my doctor and he has also advised me to not use this product."
4,"Fast, Easy to Use, Nice Design",I ordered this card reader hoping for the best as it was one of the few card readers that has an xD slot. I have had to get used to using card readers with the purchase of my MacBook and I have used several and this one is by far the fastest. It was automatically read by my computer and iPhoto picked it up immediatley as well. I was extremely impressed with the transfer speed and how well it synced with iPhoto. I would highly recommend this to anyone using a Mac who uses iPhoto a lot or for that matter anyone with a PC who would like a fast transfer rate. I was also happy with the design it does not have the cheap appearance of most other card readers. Good Product all in all.
1,This unit does not work for me yet.,"I bought a new computer which has Windows 7 which is not compatible with my Olympus Camedia camera software. I love my camera and don't want to have to buy a new one. My son suggested me to buy this Smartmedia card reader which should help me download the pictures from my camera. However, when I plugged in the device onto my computer and put in the Smartmedia card, it asked me to re-format the card which I did. I still cannot get it to work. I am waiting for my son to come home in Xmas to help me figure out. If not, I may need to call Delkin to see why it doesn't work."
4,"Good, but could be improved!",The book is an excellent source of information about Charming Tails. The only problem is that there needs to be a different value shown for pieces that are signed or that do not have boxes. Collectors would then be able to price their pieces more accurately.
4,Great For a beginner..,"This was my first guitar that I got about a year ago. It plays well, and the amp is great for distortion, etc. although the cable, strap, pics, and strings are basically worthless. The pickups combined with the high gain on the amp make for great sounding power chords. although it is a bit hard to make this guitar sound good without it being uber distorted the cable gave out in about 1 week, the pics are really thick and not too good for strumming, and the strap broke easily. When you get this guitar, you may want to put some Ernie Ball strings on before you play it, or you will be breaking them easy. This is Strictly for a beginner though, so if you buy it, plan on replacing it in a year or so."
2,A dissenting view...,"In performing these works with a smaller, chamber-scale type orchestra, the conductor certainly does achieve more clarity than is usual. However, I believe it's at the cost of the symphonic grandeur that the best ""conventional"" conductors (e.g. Walter, Klemperer, Szell and, not least Bernstein/Sony) are able to achieve. Brahms was continuing the tradition of Beethoven, not going back to the smaller scale orchestral size of Mozart. I found these performances attenuated and stripped of their power."
2,GOOD BUT ....UNLESS YOUR FRO LOS ANGELES! 111,"Man I've been too a gang of concerts and car shows throughout the West, and like many other people I hate that trick Noreaga for disrespecting my home TOWN L.A. so no RESPECT!"
5,Party with the belly dancers!!,"This CD just blows me away. If you're tired of the same old ""Party CDs"" and want your bunch to get on the tables, dance and tear off their clothes -- pop this one into your CD player. I checked the CD out recently because I kinda liked the cover art - and I just loved it!! I had it on on new years eve and people were just going crazy... Hope there's gonna be a Sound of Arabia 2 soon!"
5,Laid Back,"Many of the songs from this album resulted from the TRIO II sessions with Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton, which Linda participated on. However TRIO II wasn't released until early 1999, and was recorded in 1994, so I'm sure Linda wanted to pick up a few of the songs and make them her own on FEELS LIKE HOME. ""High Sierra"", ""After The Goldrush"", ""Feels Like Home"", ""Lover's Return"" and ""The Blue Train"" also appear on TRIO II. There are once again some stunning covers, most notably a cover of Tom Petty's ""The Waiting"" which she tears it up on and makes it her own. That off the bat is a definite highlight here. She also covers Matraca Berg's ""Walk On"", and Neil Young's ""After The Goldrush"". Once again she does not disapoint, vocally she is up to par and sounds magnificent. Highlights include ""The Waiting"", ""Blue Train"", ""High Sierra"", ""Feels Like Home"", and ""After The Goldrush"", but there is no filler here to be found."
2,Not realy helpful...,"Not realy helpful... Im IT Technical, and try some times to used, but is difficult to read the problem."
4,Electic,"I bought this soundtrack and I have yet to see the movie. The mood and atmosphere this album provokes are deep, dark and thick. I particularly enjoy tracks 2/4-6/9-10/12-13/16/19. I find myself listening to this soundtrack often contemplating the lyrics, structure etc. There is some work that I think doesn't fit the soundtrack but then again I haven't seen the movie, my scope could change once viewed. If you like music that can transport you where you can relate your own life to what your hearing, I hope you'll find this soundtrack worthy."
2,Predictable,Very disappointing cd. The only thing good about it is the new Dillinger Escape Plan song. Besides that the album is very predictable. The Damning Well sounds exactly like Filter which is rather unfortunate cause Wes is a great talent. In all nothing new or ground breaker. If anything buy it for Dillinger and that's it.
4,Is there a track Danny Can't Deal With?,"This soundtrack is incredible. Perhaps, even, better than the movie. Like the Crow soundtrack of the early nineties, this CD both sets up and breaks down the film. Featuring a who's who of talented, next-generation industrial genious, this album is at it's core a testament to the love of the genre. Danny Lohner (NIN) is instrumental in making an incredible album that both captures the dark elements of the film as well as elaborates on some of the sparse features glazed over in the film. Maynard James Keenan's presence adds another element of professionalism, and by the time you get to the David Bowie track, you're glad you bought it. See the film if you want. Buy the album even if you don't want to see the movie."
3,at least it has maynard,"im reviewing this album after just listening 5 songs (i really only wanted to listen 6 songs from here).First we have Maynard's new gig Puscifer. The song rev 20:20 is not a bad song, but not a Tool quality song either. Although it sounds more like a Nin song im giving it a 4.5/5 for the singing/screaming of maynard and the lyrics which i really liked. (Christ is coming and so am I). And by the way this is the standout song..Then we have the Wes Borland/Richard Patric group..The Damning Well...sorry guys..didnt like your song. It has totally boring guitar riffs and a sometimes anoying Richard's voice which reminds you of the bad Filter's song. 3/5The APC - Judith and Weak & Powerless remixes are good, I really like the Judith one, but its an old remix you've probably heard before. 4/5 for both songsAnd last we have Finch's Worms of the Earth. For my sorprise I liked this song, it sounds more like a GlassJaw song which is great..4/5"
4,Nine Inch Nails without Reznor,The Underworld soundtrack is dark and probably will go well with the movie. Much better than Queen of the Damned soundtrack. Milla Jovivich (Resident Evil) contributes on a few songs with a surprisingly beautiful singing voice. Maynard absolutely blows you away with his voice. Bring me the disco king will grow on you. The best song is Rev 22:20. This should hold over A perfect Circle fans until their next album.
1,DO NOT GET ACT! 2007,"I also fell for their scam that they will no longer support 6.0 so like a fool, I upgraded. First of all I lost years of attachments and email notes. I have spent endless hours on the phone with tech support. I even paid about $ 1,000 to a computer specialist to help me get things working.They all claim I am the only person having trouble. I also can't understand the people from India. I agree with the other writer that suggests a class action suit against sage. The Software and support stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I could screem that I didn't find these reviews earlier."
1,Call the BBB,"I'm sorry, but when I buy a product, I expect it to work. ACT does not. The email button, when pressed, reads something to the effect of: ""cannot open b/c database is in use of locked by user."" After wasting hours of business time on their online ""knowledge base,"" and re-installing the BRAND NEW software, I finally called tech support where Mr. Aldridge told me that I need to pay for tech support. I asked him why SAGE doesn't stand by the product they sell and deliver a working product, and he said that they do-I just need to pay them more money so the product works.I'll never buy another product from them ever again and my advice to you would be to look for some other software if you're thinking of buying ACT.I should bill them for my time."
1,"For the love of God, RUN!","I run support for a company with 5 Act users. Since the upgrade to 2006, and subsequently 2007, I've come to the following conclusion. Act 2000 was decent enough -- it was at least kind enough not to trash your system just to run it. These latest versions are an assault on all that makes sense in software design. The formats are bloated, the program consumes resources like a fleet of Hummers, leaving the polluted, twitching remains of your hardware behind. If you value your sanity, or the speed at which you can accomplish anything on your computer, take it from a humble IT guy -- Do yourself a favor and find something else.We're not running this on slouch hardware either -- Core 2 Duo 1.8 Ghz, 2 GB Ram on Vista is reduced to a quivering mass of silicon. 3 GHZ desktop P4's with 1-2 GB RAM are reduced to doddering idiots.Please -- find something else, for your own sake. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."
2,Problems with ACT 6.0,I have read some of the other Amazon.Com reviews on ACT and see that I'm not alone. I upgraded to ACT 6.0 because of problems I was having with the previous release and my laptop has been locking up ever since. They want me to upgrade to the next release to get it fixed. I don't think so. Maybe I'll just wait for Microsoft to come out with their CRM package and we'll see if ACT decides to get their ACT together and survive. I do like their software...but it has to work consistently.
3,Heavy Duty Shower Curtain Liner,I wanted a heavy duty shower curtain liner and was tired of buying ones that didn't last long. This shower curtain liner is strong and heavy. It has lasted longer than other shower curtain liners I have had but I still get mildew buildup just the same amount as the cheaper ones in the stores. I don't think it is mildew resistant.
4,Excellent quality - Heavyweight,"I purchased this shower curtain liner, and after about a year of use, it had a large mildew stain. - I accept the blame as I wasn't faithful in wiping it down after use. I liked it well enough to purchase another, and this time I will give it better care. I will write another review in a few months to let you know how this one is doing."
5,great,It does everything that it says it will. fights mildew have had it for 1 month and its still trucking
5,Wonderful.,"This shower curtain repels soap scum and doesn't mildew easily. Needs very little scrubbing to get it clean, it's quality made and I use it every day, sometimes two or three times! Love it!"
1,thick and sturdy but gets mildew,"As a curtain liner it is not bad, but I bought it because it says ""Will not mildew"" on the package. I bought 3 at a time and have replaced them all within a few months due to mildew buildup. I've finally gone through all 3 that have gotten gross and I look forward to trying a new brand!"
3,"Good, but Dangerout","We had this microwave for several years and it worked fine. Last month, it started operating when we opened the door. Needless to say, we now have a different microwave. I am in the process of trying to contact Panasonic about this."
4,I really like this one but....,"I was very pleased with the form and size of this one, and love the natural light/flash option. I was disappointed to discover that it does not have a tripod mount screw. Didn't find out till I went to screw it to my tripod. not happening. Silly me for not having looked."
4,The Real Devdas,"To all you devotees of the 2002 Devdas film, starring Shah Ruhk Khan, get ready for a challenge. How would you like to know the real story of Devdas as written by Saratchandra Chattopadhyay? As much as I loved the movie, it is no longer Devdas to me.The story of Devdas is small and simple, not a lot of flash. It is heartwarming and heart-rending at the same time. I loved the book and strongly recommend it to others. My only disappointment was the cover, which depicts the stars from the 2002 movie version. At the very least the 1955 characters would have been more appropriate given that that movie version is much truer to the actual story."
4,Tragic Love Story,"Classic tragic Indian lovestory. Devdas and Paro are childhood friends whose friendship blossoms into love, but their families have other plans for their future and esp. Paros' marriage. While Paro becomes a ""successful"" housewife, Devdas delves deeper into chaos. Great tragic love story. Recommended."
4,Some track listing confusion.,MY track listing for my CD is:1) Lizzy Borden - Me Against the World2) Fates Warning - Anarchy Divine3) Anvil - Concrete Jungle4) Trouble - The Misery Shows5) Bitch - Hot & Heavy6) Sacred Reich - Death Squad7) Hallow's Eve - Speed Freak8) Slayer - Die by the Sword - Live9) Sacrifice - Afterlife10) Diamond Head - Am I Evil11) Candlemass - At the Gallow's End12) Lizzy Borden w/Betsy - Don't Touch Me There13) Dead End - Phantom Nation14) Trouble - Come TogetherWere there different versions of Vol.3 put out by Metal Blade?
1,"Unfunny, Undubbed, Unlikable","Basically this is a new Galaxy Angel cast, with unlikable characters, unlikable stories, and pretty much everything that was good about Galaxy Angel before this series gone.I wonder what these people were thinking before they made Rune, the previous cast had lots of life left in them, they didn't need replacing.Anyway on to the facts- DVD contains 1 episode- Japanese audio audio, with Eng subs- No English dub- Is worthlessAnd lastly, Bandai Visual USA who had the license to this went out of business so really, you'd be buying this with no company to support except maybe Amazon or the seller who gets the money from you.Avoid this show if you love the previous Galaxy Angel shows."
1,LEARNING TREEHOUSE ADDITION,"The video didn't keep my son interested. I watched it, it was to boring."
3,"Adrian Mole annoys me, but good writing","This was well-written and often funny, a very interesting chronicle of the war with Iraq.I would have rated it higher, but I'm afraid I didn't like the main character much. Call me simplistic, but I don't enjoy a book as much if I don't like watching the main character. His stupid spending habits lost him a lot of my respect, and not in a funny way, but in a frustrating way. Time spent with him sometimes felt just plain banal.It kept me interested, and I've read other work by Townsend that I like more."
3,A much better Adrian Mole book than the last couple.,"A fitting wrap-up of the life of Adrian Mole, British Diarist. One could almost believe he may become happy at some time in the future. The problems plaguing Mr. Mole in this volume are slightly more age-appropriate and believable. The book is heavier than previous editions, owing to the fact that Adrian's son, Glenn is in the British armed forces, stationed in Iraq. This is a true weight on Adrian, one that was not caused by his own bumbling ineffectualness, but that of someone much more culpable. To pit her anti-hero against those who began an ill-fated war is brilliance on the part of Ms. Townsend."
1,Buy the DVD instead,"Other than asking the kids which letter makes the "" "" sound, this is just a video. We have the Letter Factory series of DVD's and my 3 and 5 year olds have learned their letter sounds from them. (The DVD's are great by the way). My kids show absolutely no interest in watching the movie on this game. The game itself is barely a game."
4,"Definitely a ""little"" black book","Once you get over the initial shock of opening your package to find a 3""x3"" book inside and wondering if you've been had you'll start finding interesting little tid bits within the tiny pages. It's not a fountain of information, but for 6 bucks it meets it's expectancy nicely. There's far more info inside it than you would think could be crammed in such a small package, some interesting...some not so much. All in all, though, I'm happy with the purchase. A great little ""pocket-book"" to read when you find yourself in a doctors office, on a trip or during down time at work."
2,"Ok, but nothing great","Its full of information that is not important. It has no ""wow"" factor. Plus, its printed in China. So you know its cheap!"
4,Great Quality,"Bulbs are decent, but I probably needed slightly higher wattage for my lamps.They out put a ton of light, but when used with an Alien Bee light they cannot keep up.Over all if you need replacement bulbs these are great for low wattage umbrella's."
4,Great Customer Service,"The item was very similar to pandora and very cheap, too. It's very good for someone who's on a budget but wants the look of a pandora."
2,Get Your Fingers Ready- Time to Click Not Helpful Again!,"For the life of me I think that Bendis' first run on DAREDEVIL tells the same story better.Believe me, I'm a comix snob's comix snob. Read my listmania list. It's just that everything in MCH is a bit obvious and REAL HEAVY HANDED. Hate to say a mainstream comic did it better, but Bendis does have a way with dialogue. To be fair, Hornshemeier's art is much better than Mack's, but a clean line beats sub-sub-sub Billy the Sink any day.Yeah, there is way worse stuff out there, but that doesn't mean this is more than a two star effort. I'd have thrown the book across the room if it didn't have pretty pictures."
3,Good For The Newcomer; Disappointing To The Oldtimer,"Having recently seen again a number of Elvis Presley's best movies (especially those made prior to 1964), I was drawn to buying this compilation to add to my very modest collection of Elvis CDs. For those who enjoy a-bit-of-Elvis every now and then, this album is quite nice indeed. The mastering is excellent, and the selection of tunes is commendable. Clearly these are his best from the movies. For the more initiated, however, this album somewhat disappointing. RCA would have been well advised to use THE MOVIE SOUNDTRACK versions of these songs, thereby enticing buyers who had the common studio versions, but who didn't yet own the so-called ""collectors' "" or ""limited edition"" versions of the movie albums with the soundtrack versions added as bonus tracks. I would have enjoyed such a compilation immensely, and hope that someone at RCA might read this and consider releasing a ""Volume 2"" version with the movie soundtrack renditions."
1,buy a different knife!!!,"i used this knife and, if you even get it close to water it starts to rust same with the screws on the sheath. i have actually seen the sheath fall apart bc the screws were so rusted. the screws on the sheath are hard to take of the sheath making it almost impossible to do maintance. i am anal about my knives always keep a thin coat of silicone on them and razor sharp."
3,"""Two Out of Three Ain't Bad""","Geez, give the guy a break! When he sings it is with passion and ""Two Out of Three Ain't Bad"" makes me listen! So, what makes Meat Loaf any different than Barbra Striesand, Whitney Houston, and many others who recycle their same old tunes over and over? At least he is hanging in there and working, which is more than you can say for some musicians. There are new tunes and some old. I enjoy it."
3,Mixed feelings.,"#1, I don't like the cover picture. Jesus was only 33 when He was crucified. This is an ugly Jeaus. Content was carefully calculated to not offend some denominational dogmas. The author is obviously theologically aware. I probably will not spend a lot of time with it, Its a little like the guy who watched the movie ""The Bible"". He said, ""I like the book better."""
2,I returned mine,"I returned mine because:1. I use McAfee's Personal Firewall. If firewall is enabled, I only get 30-45 seconds of each song before the firewall shuts it down. Yes the docs warn me that I need to open a dozen ports, but that defeats the purpose of having a firewall.2. (I have a non-netgear wireless router) I could not get it to connect when WEP is enabled.3. With firewall disabled and WEP disabled, but running wirelessly, I had too many periods of dropouts (player starved). But no one else should have been using my network, and the router and player were only feet apart.4. Wired ethernet didn't have dropouts."
1,Decent Hardware for Price. Unacceptable software.,"Not bad for the price, if it worked as advertised. The hardware is not bad. Sound quality not so hot, but acceptable. I was happy with it .... but the killer was the server software. I had a lot of problems with it... slow operation, and worst of all, my database would disappear often, forcing me to spend much time reloading it. Found out why. I have 6000+ songs. It will load these, ONCE. When you try to update anything after that, it goes nuts and does weird things and eventually clears out database on it's own. Called tech support.....they said THE SUPPLIED SERVER CAN ONLY HAND THREE HUNDRED ENTRIES. Stupid.So, if you want to keep this, you are limited. You can also use a third party server, but why?I have also tried the Linksys product, which will NOT work on WIN98SE. I also have the DLINK DSM320...best of the bunch. The DSM320 is a keeper, this Netgear, NO."
5,Excellent Book,"Read every page, and now constantly using as a reference. Great book for beginner and intermediate ability modellers. Definite A+ recommendation."
5,Exactly a Hint,"Hint water is fantastic. I drink a ton of water, but sometimes I want something with flavor. Juice is too sweet, loaded with sugar and other unnecessary ingredients. I prefer simplicity and this product is just that. The flavor ir very subtle so if you are looking for a strong flavor, this is not for you."
4,Hint essence,This one tasted better! I like to drink water without sweetner but with some flavor. This works for me.
3,Great concepts,This book is one that every couple should read - at least the first few chapters. After that it gets to be a bit redundant. Enjoyed the writing style (back and forth between the married couple) and the basic concepts they explored. Explains a lot - and I refer to it often!
3,Humor over substance,"This book doesn't tell you anything new about men & women, but it does give a good reminder with humor. We read it in a ladies' group, but it could be read as a couple. Most of our husbands were reading it over our shoulders anyway. At the end of each chapter there are ""questions"" or comments that are meant for humor!!! I think a lot of people didn't get this. Look at the end of the book for the more serious & in depth questions. This is a quick read and worth the money. Sure it's a lightweight, but it's still gets couples talking and thinking about each other which is the real intent."
2,Old fashioned ideas,I read through half of this book and couldn't finish it. The title and the theory around the title was the most interesting paragraph in the whole book. The other hints and suggestions about married life I found to be very old fashioned and simplistic and I don't think a modern couple will be able to relate to it.
1,These people are nuts!,"The book begins with some interesting thoughtful ideals, but turns into garbage.Some of the ideals presented in there are so old fashioned it's like a time warp back to the 16th century.All in all, it is a mixture of some interesting ideas, cheesy romance novel, and Bible pushing using some of the most absurd passages that could be found.I'm sure there are better relationship guides out there, so I suggest you try to find something better!"
4,The book was O.K.!,"I love to read, and I have read all the Love Stories Series books so for! This book was good, but it didn't get to the good stuff fast enough! Kylie took too long to notice that she had fallen for Ryan! To me she should have noticed this in the second chapter instead of at almost the end of the book! But above all of this I think it was an O.K. book! That is when Kylie noticed her feeling for Ryan!"
4,Sequel to Spirits of a Feather,"Souls of a FeatherBy Charles W. ShirriffSouls of a Feather is the sequel to Spirit of a Feather by Charles W. Shirriff. Continuing in the same educational vein as Spirits of a Feather, but with a more literary bend, we are presented with the continuing saga of Jay. As Jay tries to establish himself in the adult world, he must come to terms with his values and his aboriginal roots. He also deals with the hostile and manipulative father of his girlfriend, and continues his quest for his own father.If you have ever been curious about various religious philosophies, Souls of a Feather may give you some insight. Souls of a Feather will lift some readers out of their homogeneous worlds and show them how varied life really is. Again, this book would make an excellent reader for high school students.Laura Davis (Professional writer and Reviewer)"
2,A disappointment.,"Brother Phelps was a ""solo"" project by two brothers, Doug and Ricky Lee Phelps, who were originally in the Kentucky Headhunters.This album is pretty weak, compared to their excellent debut record, ""Let Go,"" from 1993. The liveliness and vitality of ""Let Go"" is gone here, buried in boring Nashville production and jaded musicianship. Also, they abandoned their brother-harmony singing style and basically made a solo album for Ricky Lee Phelps, who just doesn't carry most of the material. Nothing on here ever catches fire: if you want to hear these guys at their best, try the ""Let Go"" album instead."
4,Pioneers Of Old Hopewell: With Sketches Of Her Revolutionary Heroes,I have been working on the Hunt line for over 35 years and this book is bascally on genealogy. I have received various pieces of information over the years but this listed a lot of the information in greater detail. Plus the history of Long Island and New Jersery was very interesting.
1,Not for hockey helmets,If you're getting this for a mini hockey helmet don't bother because it doesn't fit even thought the description claims it will.
2,Poor at best,"This was Laaz Rockit's second best album and again it's below average compared to any other thrash band. The music is just bland with no rockin flow just random,unorganized riffs with stupid lyrics."
5,Rebirth of CD!!!,"I have just recently been going through my old CD's and came across this jewel. I totally forgot how much raw and powerful emotions each song can produce. Each song gives an honest glimpse into the life and faith of Bebo Norman, and one that can match many others will the same views. You will not find another CD out there like it. It is one of my all time favorites and for very good reason. Don't let this CD go another day without it in your collection."
4,"Quite good, but not the best","I bought this to replace a CD of a Bernstein interpretation from 1976 that somehow vanished. I like it quite a bit, but it's not my old Bernstein. Mars is a little slow and cluttered toward the end, and lacking the organ that really set the tone for me. Also, it was a little too legato in the louder portions. Jupiter also seemed to drag some. Saturn is really beutiful and haunting, though. Overall, it's grown on me. The Bernstein performance I had is out of print now and I can't find it anywhere, but I'm not disappointed by the replacement."
5,A Note on Historical Significance,"I must admit that I haven't actually read this novel, but based on the description and reviews, it seems like an enjoyable read. The reason I am writing this ""review"" is just to let everyone know that there was an actual woman in the Civil War who found herself in similar situations. Sarah Emma Edmonds spent her childhood in Canada, eventually fleeing to Michigan to escape her abusive father. There, she took a male alias and enlisted in the Union army as a nurse, eventually becoming an impressive spy. I won't tell the end of her story, lest it closely resembles that of Sarah Whee___'s (as much as it already does!), but Edmonds published her life story in ""Soldier, Nurse, and Spy: A Woman's Adventures in the Union Army."" If anyone is truly interested in this remarkable woman, you should check out her honest and detailed story!"
3,glaring error,It was well written for the most part but if an author is going to set a book in a particular local then SOME effort should be expended to make it somewhat factual.I lived in various parts of michigan for 45 years and I can assure you there are no mountains in michigan!
4,Pet Shop Boys - Nightlife (1999) .... One In The Same?,"I cant properly describe the album style, but I would tend to lean toward 'trance'. The Album was released in 1995 and the production quality is fantastic. If you have heard the 1999 album by the Pet Shop boys titled 'Nightlife' and enjoyed it, then this album is for you. Every title has an up tempo happy beat that will keep you wanting more.Enjoy."
3,"Still fun, but Stick to the first edition!","We do a lot of game nights with friends, so Battle of the Sexes has always been one of our favorites. I like the first edition better. It is more fun to play with friends than this second edition. The second edition reminds me a little too much of trivial pursuit rather than a fun, couples game."
1,Do not waste your money,"This is not a good game. Not even close. There are numerous issues, including:- The directions aren't clear. When does someone win? What's this about blocking someone? Why is the board shaped like it is?- The questions are ridiculous. We went three rounds until we quit out of boredom. No one had missed a question yet. An example question (no joke!) is: ""Replace two letters to get this song title: SPELLS LIKE SEEM SPIRIT"". Is there anyone who wouldn't get that?- Some questions are visual, where the team answering the question has to look at the card with a graph on it. But the answer is right below the graph! This is a terrible invention.The game was not fun at all. I recommend looking elsewhere for entertainment."
3,Works well,Not so sure I will buy the Safari model again-it does do a good job removing the excess fur from the dogs but holding onto the handle a particular way so the adjustable piece does not slide out is not a selling point.
4,One Fat Summer,"I lilked this book becuase it was realistic. Nobody flew or lived through 100 explosions! I also like this book becuase it isn't to long or to short. It has just the right amount of page numbers, 236. One thing I didnt like about the book, was that it was kind of boring. It took about 5 pages just for Bobby to mow half a lawn! Other than that I liked the book alot.I think the best part of the book is when Whille pulles out a gun on Bobby. In this book whillie is a town bully. The book is very detailed, and I could picture the whole scene in my head.I think the climax was the most vivid element in the book. It had a lot of detailes and was action packed. There was fighting in between Whillie an Bobby, gun shooting,and heroism! Thats why the climax is my favorate part of the book. Then there was the resolution. I liked the resolution becuase, in the end Bobby looses a lot of pounds from mowing and he finaly stands up to Whillie."
4,"A great, fun book.",I really liked the book because of my relation to the character. I saws alot of me in the character.
4,fat summer a fat book,"young Bobby marks is a normal teenager except he is obeis this book follows this teenagers journey through summer break.Having to deal with insults he gets a job working for a rich man in town. Working for money he mows, puls weeds, and other garden works. But all is not well for later he jumped stashed on a island naked. So if you like witty funny books this is for you."
5,I couldn't put the book down!,"One day I came home from school and my twelve year-old brother had this book, One Fat Summer, on his desk. I picked the book up and the second I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It is truly a book for all ages because at the time I was 16. I also know quite a few adults who enjoyed the book because it reminded them of their childhoods. I grew up going upstate New York to a lake, just like Bobby, every summer. The book helped me enjoy many of my memories while capturing my imagination with its irresistible storyline. If a taste of summer is what you're looking for, read One Fat Summer and take a walk around a lake!"
3,Can't Find Anything,"This is an excellent theoretical treatment of the topic. However, any book that lacks both an index and a table of contents automatically starts out with a three star rating for me. Granted, this is a compilation of technical papers; nevertheless, an index for a text of this type is indispensible. Without it, it is very difficult to find anything. Each part has a table of contents, but there are no corresponding page numbers for the items in the table of contents."
5,The best or iron supplements,"This product works better than any other supplement for iron. I have Crohn's disease, making absorption of vitamins difficult and exercise painful at times. However, this liquid form (when taken in a 4-6 oz glass of orange juice) is absorbed quickly and easily. Do NOT take with vitamin D or within 30 min of caffeine or it WILL NOT be absorbed. To avoid tooth staining, use a baking soda based toothpaste."
5,Dog Collar,"Collar is very well constructed, and ideal for my 50 pound dog. The metal grommets for the holes prevent premature breakdown of the material; thus the collar's life is extended.A great product, and highly recommended."
1,Way Too Much Perfume!,"The product works ok, it is the strong, way too strong, smell of the Rose that is unbearable. It clingsto your hair all day. This is not an essential oil Turkish Rose, it is a chemically based perfume. Thisnegates any benefits one gets from not using shampoo. They ought to make it in a neutral scent."
4,Who the heck is Jeff Batemann?,"The only bright spot on this average soundtrack is the Paul Westerberg and Joan Jett version of ""Let's Do it"", the rest of the stuff ranges from average to awful (just like the movie). If there is one benefit of the movie Tank Girl it's the Westerberg/Jett duet, the movie is unwatchable."
3,"too ahead of her time, perhaps","It's a bit like femme Roxy Music --well, actually, a lot like femme Roxy Music, circa Avalon. And that's not a bad thing. This record haunted me too, and ""The Big Picture"" is redolent...with, um, ""the photograph/you left behind..."" nice stuff. I hear this and I'm on the Taconic heading into the city, and it's dusk. There's a lot of nice imagery in her music and lyrics, but Nan came on the scene too early. If she busted out with Manta Ray in, say, 2005 or so, she'd be the Nelly Furtado of today."
3,Promising Ideas,"The authors have promising ideas about self-help for women. Based on the advertising and reviews, maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe its just me, but something about the tone, style, pitch, attitude or whatever you call it, struck me as pushy or arrogant or over-hyped. Perhaps in a superficial way. Other cognitive therapy workbooks seem a bit more realistically helpful to me. The aggressive advertising left me disappointed with the actual book. I find overly optimistic, simplistic hype to be a general problem in psychology today. More time and energy seem to be spent marketing a book than writing it. The result can be de-motivating. Monster Lies is an OK book, just not great in the way the promo proclaims."
4,The best lyrically of the 3 CD trilogy,"""The Coming"" shows Busta Rhymes at his hungriest both lyrically and artistically. Beats and rhymes dovetail to produce stellar results. The best songs on this album are ""Do My Thing,"" ""Everything Remains Raw,"" ""It's A Party,"" and ""Ill Vibe."""
4,Busta knows beats!!!!!,"Gotta give credit to Busta, he was good with LONS, and now on his own, proves that his style is pure original!!!! Keep on keepin on, Busta!!!"
4,Worth a read,"Educating young men and women about date rape is an essential part of a civilized society. Teaching young girls about rape, and how to reduce their chances based on observance, facts, and self-defense is crucial. Therefore, buying this book for teenage girls is a good idea.This is not to say the author is blaming the victim... but rather that a person is able to empower themselves to learn more about this epidemic crime that is hardly ever reported or prosecuted, and learn how to assess a situation where normally she would suppress her radar in order to appear agreeable.The idea of knowing more about this crime as he outlines in this book, and arming yourself with basic self-defense techniques (both verbal and physical) could especially be helpful in a date-rape situation where the case is normally that the victim knows the attacker."
5,The truth will bite ya in the a**,"With essay titles such as ""Babies are Dirty"" and""Your Mother is a Whore,"" you can't go wrong. Most articlesare just rants which howl against Americana in all her glory, butthere are researched articles as well. Serial murderers and The Top 100 suicides are documented here with as much pathos and care as the Goad's can muster.Currently Jim Goad is imprisoned for a charge unrelated to his writing, yet his essays were brought up as evidence to set his bond at an unheard of $760,000.Buy the Book! _The Redneck Manifesto_ is another book of Goad's, which I can't recommend in good conscience. END"
1,Way TOO frustrating!!,"The concept of this game is great! And there is great potential on the specific tasks to explore. However, I (an adult) got frustrated trying to use it. It's way too sensitive on exactly where your lines need to be to have your item considered correctly drawn, or too sensitive to be able to keep your line within the line to do the mazes. I really wish this was easier to use. What a great concept - it's unfortunate it's too frustrating to use!"
3,Draw and write,"I wanted my kids to practice their letters which this offers and they enjoy it for the most part, it is not their favorite. I do not like that if they do not write the letter correctly the game tells them to do it later and leaves the session. It would be nice if the game didn't encourage them to stop even trying."
3,Draw & Write,"I wish I would have read the review before buying this game, my son likes it,but he's always saying it's not working right, but it is, it's just wanting the kids to write perfect. And I'm sorry a 4 year old will not be writing perfect just yet. I don't think they tested this game with kids of all ages."
5,Bluesman,"The atmosphere is touchable, you're actually there watching and waiting. I heard the music, found myself humming. Beautifully written, real and positive. A book to embrace and cherish forever."
3,Light blue,"Dubus is known for his short stories. This novel will not change that focus. In it, he tries to use some Hemingway prose, describe how music sounds, and find a plot for a growing-up story. It will fade from memory when finished."
5,Great cycle trainer,"I bought one of these a few years ago for PT after broken leg & pretty bad ankle damage. I didn't want a stationary bike, so I got this for my bike. It works well. My only recommendation is to use a tire that's a 'street' tire on it. I have two different bikes (road & mountain bike), and the mountain bike tire tread was noisy. The road bike tire was not, though. I spent several hours using it over several months and the thing looks brand new still."
5,Hair Brush,"What can I say, the Natural Bristle Hair Brush does a great job & it is confortable to hold when brushing. The cost was a good price. I could have paid much more for another brush, but why? I am happy with my purchase."
1,Just doesn't go through my course hair.,"I read the reviews and throught for sure that this brush would work on my course textured hair, but I just cannot get a good thorough brush stroke through my hair with it. Would not buy it again."
2,What Every Silver Dollar Buyer Should Know.,"This book is most suitable for the investor willing to spend large sums for high grade Morgan and Peace dollars. The average collector probably will not get much useful information out of the book.In the section on grading standards, only mint state grading standards were listed; and then several mint state standards were omitted, such as mint state MS-64, MS-66 and MS-68. Grades of MS-69 and MS-70 were listed, but if one did find a coin in those grades, the price would probably be way out of reach.This book was written in 1984 and a lot of the specific coin information is outdated. A second updated edition would be useful for an investor."
5,One of the best albums of the latter half of this decade,"Clutch's second and self-titled full-length release has everything fans of harder music would want. Inhuman groove, witty lyrics and a dynamic drummer. Their live show is the only thing that could top this album. Concept rock, maybe, but the themes this album carries are by far some of the most original to come out in a long time. A huge recommendation for anyone into stoner-rock, southern-rock, Sabbath, hell-ANYTHING. This music will put the swagger back in your step."
1,Helpful only if you already know the material,"This book is of little help in learning the topic as a stand alone book. The examples are of little use, and most of the problems have no solution listed. Even when answers are given, the supporting work is missing, leaving you wonder how they arrived at their answer. Don't waste your time, or money on this book."
4,great mambo and salsa music,"Hilton Ruiz was a great jazz and latin music pianist who did a lot of session work in and around NY for a lot of years, as well as many other places, too. This CD has him fronting a nine piece band, (four percussionists!) playing mambo and salsa music. The first cut is Mambo Numero Cinco, an old Perez Prado song (how could you have a mambo music album without a Perez Prado song?). It sets the tone for the rest of the CD, which sounds a lot like a Pancho Sanchez record (nothing wrong with that!). I saw Hilton Ruiz playing in the band of Rahsaan Roland Kirk back in the mid 1970's in a jazz club in Greenwich Village, it was one of the greatest live jazz shows I ever saw. He died not too long ago in a silly and foolish way, I think he stumbled on the curb coming out of a bar or something. If you like latin music, you will definitely enjoy this CD, these are great musicians."
5,Funnies Tintin I've ever read.,"I read Tintin since I was 5 years old. Up to now, I've had collected all Tintin's book. From all Tintin's story, I enjoy this book much, especially the part when Alan met the monkey who looks like Rastapopoulos and said that he's familiar with such face. It really makes me laugh. I like it also because it includes Indonesia in its book. And Calculus was really really funny too in this book, together with the crazy tricky billionaire-man. It's really entertaining."
3,somewhat different from the usual tipe. facsinating.,"Flight 714 is offbeat, considering the tintin stories areusually somewhat believable. The story starts off quite normalbut progresses into a science fiction like story wuich, I think,is a mix of Indiana jones and a light version of the X-files. Tomore picky readers, this book would probably be rated quitelow, but to me, I think herge was just simply expressinghimself into the book in a different way than ever before.P.S.: While writing the book just before this one, Hergesuffered a majore depretion, and perhapps he changedhis style of storytelling"
5,Lenox at reduced price,"I have been building up my Lenox Butterfly Meadow set thru Amazon.com. This order completes my set of 8 fruit bowls. I have also ordered thru amazon.com, the dessert dishes, the pie dish, the square baker, the covered casserole and the small bowl.Thank you Amazon.com for this service. The orders arrive quickly, very well wrapped in perfect condition. These dishes are covered by Lenox' lifetime breakable replacement policy. You can sign up at the Lenox website."
2,"Well, Maybe Two and One-half","Just wanted to let a little air out of the Natalie Adoration Society. Yes, there is no voice like hers, but I believe that the weight given to her work is off the mark. I find ""depth"" in her lyrics to actually be pretty lacking - there seems to be an air of pretense that has followed her solo career."
2,Natalie is nothing without 10000 maniacs.,"Carnival is a great tune. Natalie has a tremendous voice, her timbre is accentuated by the metre that she seems fond of, (These Are Days). 10000 Maniacs provided a background sound of plucky, almost amateurish, acoustics which by contrast, lent credence and strength to Natalies already strong vocals. Since solo, Natalie seems to have gotten superficially serious on us, and seems to suffer from the more serious, and mechanical acoustics, of late."
2,The blandest recorded music I've ever heard.,"Natalie's got a beautiful voice, but why does she have to sing in such a po-faced style? For a CD that's full of such sentimental topics, it failed to stir any emotions/feelings (except boredom). Recommended for insomniacs though."
4,Great Sound,"I didn't know that in order to get the most out of this audio DVD you have to have a special DVD player. I don't so I cannot get the most out of the sound on this DVD, but even with a standard player it sounds great. I think the best song on here (in terms of sound) is Seven Years. Even if you don't have a DVD player, buy Natalie's Tigerlily or Ophelia, which is even better."
1,NOSURRENDER,THIS CD IS THE MOST HORRIBLE THING I HAVE EVER HEARD. TALK ABOUT POP TRASH....HOW DID THIS WOMAN GET A RECORD CONTRACT. OH YEA SHE USED TO HAVE TALENT WITH THAT BAND TEN THOUSAND MANIACS
1,Love and enthusiasm don't always equal quality,"This book is written by Sherlockian Rolf Canton. He is obviously a huge fan of Holmes, and has put this book together with a great degree of enthusiasm. However, it lacks the most important ingredient: skill.The book itself is a odd hodgepodge of things: the best thing is the opening essay, 'The Moriarty Principle', which looks at the role and importance of Moriarty in defining Sherlock Holmes. Then we have lots of photos of the Norwegian Explorers of Minnesota, a Sherlock Holmes fan club, poems (more or less - there is a lot more to poetry than just getting things to rhyme!), some essays of aspects of the Holmes canon and related matters (including an examination of whether Holmes' assigned birthday of 6 January really suits the astrological sign that would be his), some scripts and fiction.Sadly, it really isn't worth the cost of the book overall."
5,Real Erroll,"Of my three favorite Erroll Garner CDs (""Jazz Round Midnight"" and ""This Is Jazz"" are the others) this one is the most rhythmically exciting. It has more of the ""live"" feeling wherein Erroll seems to experiment more while joyfully grunting his satisfaction at his own innovative talent. In this crisply-recorded CD he's just having a helluva good time tossing his spine-tingling perfection all over the place (""Autumn Leaves"") and while many of the selections really jump (""How High The Moon"" and surprisingly enough ""More"") he also slows the pace to a sentimental stroll by the lake in his magnificent ""Gaslight"" - for my money as hauntingly memorable as his classic ""Misty"". This is the incomparable Garner at his full range and power. Trust me, if you love great jazz in all its tempos you'll LOVE this fabulous CD."
2,Not Up To Mackie Reputation,I'm returning this mixer for the 1604 VLZ3. The CFX 16-mkII is pretty poorly designed. What's with the idea to run the signal through the Sub Mix to get to the main outputs? I don't know what they were thinking. No mono output either. I don't think it has the quality sound of the old 1604's either.
1,Agonizingly painful,"David W. Mount is a terrible writer. I can't believe how much of a chore this book is to read. His sentences, in my opinion, are ambiguous and I find myself backtracking unnecessarily."
3,"The paradox of ""creativity experts""","I'm glad people like Michalko are out there studying creativity and trying to organize their findings in books of this sort. But I am struck by a very odd thing: If these guys have figured out how creative people do their thing, why haven't they figured out how to become creative themselves?Instead, these ""creativity experts"" strike me as being like someone who would write a sex advice book without having much sexual experience himself. I would be more impressed by one of these guys if he had turned himself around from lesser to greater creativity through the use of the techniques he describes, as evidenced through patents for commerically successful inventions, or something like that. The whole point of offering self-help advice is that one can demonstrate that he knows what he is talking about."
2,Making Mosaics: 15 Stylish Projects from Start to Finish,"Having seen Martin Cheek's website, which contains an impressive and whimsical sampling of his own work, I was looking forward to a ""projects"" book by him. I am a bit disappointed. The projects are, for the most part, completely aesthetically unappealing to me. The level of the book is ""beginner"" (which I am), so initially I thought the images were overly simple in order to accommodate the reader's lack of expertise. At the same time, however, he suggests projects which would be out of the realm of most beginning mosaicists -- like making and firing your own decorative tiles, for instance. And although each project comes replete with a long list of necessary supplies, in some cases he never mentions any instructions for certain items on the list. Maybe his intermediate/advanced level books are better."
5,Great book for beginners,I just finished the book displayed on the cover. This is a great book for all levels. It contains about 15 mosaics with directions on how to make them. There are also pictures of beautiful mosaics.
2,Waiting On My Exchange,"I waited too long for delivery. It took nearly 2 weeks for me to received a shipment that supposedly shipped the same or next day. I received a ring that was much larger in size than the order specified, and the band was bent. I requested a size 10, and the bandwidth of the item I received exceeded the size 10 bandwidth on the ring sizing chart.I returned the ring via certified mail and requested an exhange. The return was confirmed received on Friday 3 August. The vendor kindly informed me that the order would be processed and shipped on Monday 6 August. Except for the flawed band & wrong size, I like the design and alloy. But if this order takes more than a week to receive, I will not purchase from this merchant again because the delivery time does not justify the original shipping cost. Moreover, if the exchange is sized incorrectly or the band is bent, I will request a refund."
5,Great !!,"Disc was is great shape , no scratches better than in the description shipped same day and the price is the best part!"
4,It's Quicksand and Rage Against The Machine!!!!!!,"This album has got so much raw power and energy!More than any other of their E.P's or albums! I know alot of people aren't going to agree with my definition of the band or album. But, I really think it sounds like the bastard child of Quicksand and Rage Against The Machine! Both of which are really good bands. I would like to see Chaka and Zach go toe to toe in some fisticuffs! That would be cool! Who would win?"
4,War with a Twist,"This game is basically war with a twist. Each person turns over a card and calculates the number, if both players are correct, the one with the highest total takes the cards.Although the rules are boring, the cards are very bright and appealing. They can be sorted by color for difficulty. The cards are very heavy and durable. This is a good set.I changed the rules to make the game a little more appealing. I added in an extra pile of cards. At the beginning of each round, we turn over an extra. First person to come to the correct conclusion keeps that card. That small rule change adds some skill requirement and excitment to the game and kept my 4 1/2 YO playing (and learning).This is a card game worth adding to your collection."
2,the goth band's a hoot,"Here we have a fairly pedestrian entry into the horror genre, but one not without its charm. We have a gang of teenagers sight seeing in an abandoned asylum, populated by a deranged killer.By and large, it's a typical 80's horror film. It's largely comedic. The gore factor isn't remarkable by any means, but not bad. The best part of the movie is the all female angry political cheese-goth band. They're a hoot. Beyond that it's all here. The cheesy 80's goth band, the ridiculous plot twist, and a thoroughly respectable pointless excuse for the topless girl shot. Worth viewing if you're a horror fanatic and you have an hour and a half you were going to waste anyway."
3,"Neat idea, low-budget execution","Decent, if awkward low-budget entry in the slasher genre. Poor dialog, lackluster pacing, not much panache, but the condemned insane asylum that's provided as backdrop for the young stars and starlets to run amuck through before getting hack'd n' slashed is inspired. But seriously, the main reason to check out this horror relic (from the direct-to-VHS days) is Patty ""Frankenhooker"" Mullen and her nerdy friend (Charlotte from Sex & The City). If you're a fan of bad 80's horror, add another star."
1,(garbage),I can only hope that this woman has found God. It's sad to see and hear someone exploit themselves. I remember this song and was apalled then...now the song has hit the airwaves again as part of a compilation CD. God loves us all.
3,Great song from a one hit wonder,"When Adina came out with Freak like me, it had a impact not seen since Donna Summer's Love to Love You Baby. Her pose on the album cover was also hot. Other than that the other songs were average and this album reflected why adina is a 1990's one hit wonder."
3,little big horn,"Long enough but the spoon is too thick. Would rather have had a metal spoon, wider and thinner but I'll do with what they sent. It is made well, the spring loaded stick prevents breakage, I'll learn to use it. I can adapt."
3,Shoe Horn Review,"The shoe horn is fine, but does not meet my needs.I need a shorter and more ridged shoe horn."
2,It's OK,"Bought a long shoe horn at IKEA several years ago for just a couple of buck. Absolutely love it and, of course, they don't carry it anymore. Have been looking for another and bought this one largely based on the reviews of others, even though it's a lot more money. It works OK, but I like the IKEA one better. The shape of the horn seems awkward and I'm not convinced the spring adds anything. You have to be careful not to get it too far down into the shoe because it doesn't come out easily."
1,ear aid batteries,"It was not that I did not like the product, I did not like with the people that sold it."
2,Not very chocolatey--not at all like a brownie,"Yes, they are chewy. They're probably as low in fat as they say they are. And it's undoubtedly a good cause. But pay attention to the ingredient list. There is more fig than anything else, and it shows in the flavor [or lack]. There is less chocolate than fig, flour and sugar. And it shows. If you dig a chocolate chip out of one [not easy because they're kind of melded in with the cookie], you'll find that even that's not very chocolatey.Laudable effort to create a healthier unhealthy snack for kids, and they might like it OK, but not this chocolate lover.If you really love chocolate, look elswhere."
4,"Spirit filled, profound read",An in depth poetic journey which challenges the spiritual sincerity of our religious training. An honest cry to the Creator and a display of unconditional love. A must read for anyone who is searching to find their true spiritual purpose in this journey. Know who you are and that God created you that way...in love!
3,It's OK,"It does a pretty good job of lubricating the chain, but I probably won't buy it again. It attracts sand worse than any lube I have ever used. I had better luck with the wax based lubes."
4,Self- esteem,Michelle McKinney Hammond writes about finding one's self in God and living our your calling.
4,Good Stuff,"Excellent, old-school ambient album. Very similar in feel, I think, to David Sylvian's Gone To Earth (and for some reason I think Bill Nelson added some guitar here and there on that one). Bought the album on cassette when it came out and recently replaced that with CD. Beware, the CD release of ""Chance Encounters..."" is actually 2 CDs (but in separate jewel cases). It would appear Disc 1 is entitled ""Chance Encounters..."", but Disc 2 is in a separate jewel case and possibly labelled something else...the 2 CD's encompass the cassette version and then some. Purchased a single CD of the album (not knowing/realizing the ""full set"" consisted of two)...and am a little disappointed that it's not the complete set as I owned it on cassette. But the disc I got is, at least, all of the first side of the cassette, which was always my favorite portion."
5,wonderful memories,this album renewed my love for roy orbisons voice and creativity. also his backup instrumentilists and voices are 5 stars. makes me want more.
5,An Indispensible Reference,"This is an indispensible reference book for farriers or anyone else working in animal husbandry. The illustrations and layout are user-friendly, and everything in the book has been designed with usefulness in mind.The best reference of its kind, newly updated. This book is in it's ninth edition, and is the standard in the industry. A very handy reference for any horseman, farrier, veterinary office, or student."
5,"Very, very good workout!","I love Chris Freytag! I now have 3 videos of hers and they are all so diverse, yet so thorough. I love how she changes things up and you are never bored. You will definitely feel it with this video, I promise! I work out 5 to 6 times a week, doing a workout tape every day. I am in very good shape and I highly recommend this tape for all levels of fitness. It is so fun and has lots of variety."
3,Major let-down in flavor,"I thoght the intro and info in the beginning was nice. The pictures are nice. The layout of the recipes is unconventional with an ingredient list and directions step by step with ingredients in bold print. The general ideas are great...but, sorry...the flavor, spice, and fire is severely lacking. My favorite cuisine is Indian and I like it spicy. So, I have to add on to these recipes."
1,Rubbish!!,"What a sorry excuse for a pet barrier!!! Would serve more purpose as a butterfly net! Highly difficult to install, velcro doesn't like to stick to the car and with it's flimsy design, I could sneeze and it would fall down!! Save your money!"
3,Great concept but bad execution,The idea is great but like others have said the sticky tabs don't stick to your car. I went and got some sticky velcro peices and did my own hanging job and I really like it. It is nice that it keeps most of the hair from coming up in to the front. So if you want to spend another 5 dollars on velcro it is a good option.
3,Good with reservations,"The stick-on system to anchor the barrier does not work. However, if you buy 6 micro bungie chords and anchor the barrier to parts of the car, it works great. I like how easy it is to take down and put back up."
3,Poor fit for Lexus RX350,"The barrier does not fit in my vehicle as shown in the photo. I have a 2004 Lexus RX350. The barrier attaches to the vehicle by a small sticky piece that looks like velcro, however in my car it has to attach to a fabric liner, not plastic or the glass windows. I don't know how that will last long term - I've already had one come off. The interior of my car is not symmetrical and I had to shift the barrier off center - which is not a problem, just off center. There is a space of a few inches that remains open between the bottom of the barrier and the seat back and a dog could put their head up there. I'll try attaching the extra sticky and closure to help tighten that area. Overall: I wouldn't recommend this product for very active dogs."
4,A Tale of Loss and Friendship,"Is there an unforgiveable sin? If so, what is it, and if you choose not to forgive a transgression, who is punished more -- the sinner or the victim? In this sensitive portrayal of friendship and loss, Leah Stewart investigates the many facets of friendship, the question of how much you can truly know someone, and how we can never truly protect ourselves from pain, no matter how hard we try.For the most part, I thought this book was extremely well-written, though the plot was a bit far-fetched. Her characters were vivid and alive, and very believable -- so believable that I was willing to overlook the way-too-coincidental elements.A fascinating, provocative look at friendship."
5,Awesome band.. awesome album!,"Cinder Road's debut album, ""Superhuman,"" is nothing short of fantastic. I first heard of them back in April through my friend, and I've been a huge fan ever since. I've traveled out of state twice to see them, and in total, have seen them 7 times within 5 months. I won't do that for any band unless I consider them amazing. And Cinder Road is just that.""Superhuman"" does not disappoint. There's not a single song on there that I dislike, and I rarely say that about any album. I can honestly say in the short amount of time I've known them, they've become my favorite band, and some of my favorite people.For lack of a better word, it's nice to have a good, solid rock album out there. It's a change of pace from everything else out now; everything that seems to all sound the same. ""Superhuman"" outshines quite a few in my book, even those that have been around for some time, and that's quite an accomplishment.Pick up a copy or two; satisfaction is guaranteed!"
5,It was the best and to this day still is,I use to watch this series when i was younger and out of nastalgia i purchased the first season. One day my two daughters(eldest is 6 the younger is 4) got curious and wanted to watch it. So I popped in the first dvd and almost instantly it grabbed there attention. They sat and watched the whole thing through without moving or asking for anything which if u have kids you know how amazing that is. So i guess you could say the Powerpuff Girls were reborn. So my overall point is eventhough we the older loved and watch the series an give it so much credence a truly good series is one that can last through the generations. As is proof of my own view points and that of my childrens. And this why I will always give the series 5 stars.
1,Nothing but problems,I had been very happy with TV for the first month but a reoccurring technical problem as made me regret purchasing it. The TV now loses picture and sound after being on for about 20 minutes. Despite still being under warranty this problem has yet to be corrected after several visits by an RCA technician over the past month. I would absolutely not buy this TV again and I strongly suggest that anyone who purchases it consider checking to make sure there is a competent repair center that can make housecalls in your area (TV is way to big to haul back and forth to the many service calls you may need).
1,"RCA F38310 38"" REVIEW",I HAVE OWNED ONE FOR OVER A YEAR AND IN THIS TIME I HAVE HAD 3 RECEIVERS PUT IN AND HAVE THE SERVICE PEOPLE OUT 5 OR 6 TIMES AND EACH TIME IT IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.BUT WHEN IT WORKS IT'S THE BEST TV I HAD EVER HAD GREAT FOR PLAYING X-BOX OR NINTENDO ON.
3,Any word on a second generation?,"I do not own this TV, therefore, it wouldn't be fair to provide a rating. I couldn't post witout one though so I took the middle ground w/3 stars. There really seems to be a LOT of bad customer reviews out there for this one. sounds like the kind of thing that may be remedied by a newer model. Any word on a second generation?"
2,Replace DM1 module after 18 months,"Purchased for Christmas, 2002. Excellent picture. No troubleuntil June, 2004. Heard a ""popping"" sound and the on screen menuwent berserk. DM1 module needs to be replaced. Cost: $1500.00Fortunately, we purchased an extended warranty. They havedecided to replace the TV with one of equal quality plus aseparate HD Directv Receiver. Do not purchase this unit unless you have money to throw away or you like to gamble. Also, wehad to travel a long distance to take the unit to a service center who would EVEN begin to check and repair the set."
5,Awesome,"This BBQ is awesome. I've owned it for 3 months, and use it at least once a week. I've cooked for 26 people on it, and I've cooked for two of us. I'm a fair cook, but this grill makes me look like an expert. The ""flavorizer bars"" sound like the worst type of hyped crap, but they absolutely prevent me from burning my food. Seriously, I haven't burned anything on this grill yet! Granted, they may not add any flavor, but I still think they are great.As for heating ability, let me just say that it's 18 degrees outside (northern Utah) and I'm BBQ'ing. I couldn't do this on my old BBQ!I haven't noticed any darkening of the SS, but I won't be surprised if it happens. Had this been available in something other than stainless, I would have bought it.I've never owned a solid stainless grate before, and was a little wary, but it's worked out great.I would seriously recommend this for anyone who wants to spend this kind of money on a BBQ."
5,Self Determination,"We all should be so lucky to have Jack holding our hand during those last moments. Humanity's passions must embrace self determination.Stop controlling other peoples last moments.Exceptional acting by the whole cast. Directing was invisible, the cinematography pointed, the writingpractical, concise, and informative. Dr. Kevorkian's story inspires courage. ""It isn't a victory its just common sense."" When the prisoners are the heroes the society is condemned."
1,non-fiction?,"This is a terrible book. It presents highly speculative and unfounded conspiracy theories as if they're actually true! It doesn't belong on the non-fiction shelf of the library, which is where I found it. Please don't spend money on authors like this, who have no qualms about making a profit by spreading lies about the assassination of JFK."
3,some strong singles here,I remember jamming to the hip hop/reggae cuts anything for you(too bad the remix with beenie siegal and nadine sutherland wasn't featured on this) and sexy girl and I remember enjoying some other cuts on this album too but it's been so long that I can't remember all the songs and I've misplaced the CD
3,Great for a good debate,"Grede looks at the mistakes history has made in being culturally and politically insensitive and warns us of making too many assumptions of what is a right or wrong in the areas of multiculturalism and Political Correctness. He also debates what motivates our decisions in this area. The goal : To allow without hindrance all cultures and to endure without repugnance all peoples. He suggests a sensitivity to all societies and a greater representation to the person of Jesus.He returns to the example that Jesus taught us as he was placed in society. Jesus went against the culture of his day, accepted the opposed in society, rejected the black and white of law, had pure motives and proclaimed freedom unlike society will ever experience while bound by this world.A good discussion starter"
4,Farberware Impulse Buy,"This was an impulse buy right before Thanksgiving, which is unlike me, as I will generally check out a product before purchase. After I came home, I researched Farberware knives and there were some negative comments, so I was concerned that I would have to deal with returning this product. However, I was pleasantly surprised! The knives look good and they were sharp. I did, however, need to sharpen two of the large knives. I don't know if this was due to manufacturing, or if I just like exceptionally sharp knives. The knives have held their edge and I am pleased with this product.Two negatives: 1-the scissors included in this set could have come from the dollar store. They are cheap and pretty useless; 2-I wish there was the option of storing these knives flat--I don't like the look of this big butcher block on our counters. It doesn't match my kitchen and the block is about 2 inches too long to hide inside any of my cabinets."
1,Do not buy this item,Very low quality. After about a week of use the knives have rusted. I Do not recommend this item.
5,the master,"i have often listened to this cd, and it is without a doubt a masterpiece, the track with oleta adams is brilliant, a must for any of her fans too, my personal favourite has to be willow weep for me, a very sexily played song"
1,Very smooth -- jazz???,"If you like ""smooth jazz,"" this album is a competent, well conceived, even pretty example of the genre. But can't you be satisfied with just ""smooth""? Because this is not jazz. What does it lack? Jazz is a soloist's medium. There are great jazz ensembles that play magnificent arrangements, but you won't hear many Basie or Ellington classics that don't feature spontaneous, creative, provocative and original soloists. Sanborn's playing is far too ""smooth"" to contain any of these traits. His playing is lovely, it may soar and you may find it emotionally touching. But to those of us who love jazz, in all it's forms -- traditional, swing, be-bop, hard bop, post be-bop, free jazz, from Louis Armstrong to Muhal Richard Abrams -- ""smooth jazz"" doesn't cut it."
3,Sleeping Freshman Never Lie,"The book ""Sleeping Freshman never lie"" is a good book. It is a tale of four friends who live on the same street and have been friends since all of them can remember. The summer before ninth grade they all were going through changes and didn't hang out as much as they used to. As their high school career starts out they find out that they don't have any classes with each other and not all of them are in the same lunch. One of the boys is Mitchell and her gets a girlfriend and that changes everything. I give this book three stars. It was good, but however there were parts of it that were on the boring side too. So this was an ok book."
2,More of the Same,"Beautiful photos, but the text was too clever for clever sake. Save your pennies by not buying this book and hire a decorater. Or better yet, trust your instincts."
1,Enough already,"Haven't we overdosed on semiotics taken to its idiotic extreme? Do throw rugs and hardwood floors really ""say"" that much about us? Can you tell how daring we are simply by the number of knick-knacks we own? This book is forensic jive from self-appointed experts whose only real concern is whether or not their tastes conform to the latest Interview fad."
4,Yum!,"Got this for my boyfriend who's in the early stages of learning to cook. He likes it on burgers, steak and even in his turkey scrambles. It's a success!"
1,The worst ever,"1 star is too much for this movie. This movie is a joke, the worst that I have ever seen. don't buy it, you know what, don't even bother renting it. It's that bad. I have seen not all but lots lots of Hong Kong movies and this one gets my vote for the worst ever. I love the Swordsman I & II movies and I think the 1st movie is one of the best of all time."
4,Good Sound and Comfortable,Great tap shoes for beginners and others. Have great sounding taps and are comfortable and easy slip on and off. Only thing is that you would need an insole for support on your arch and the ball of your foot.
3,Great Country French Style (Better Homes & Gardens,"This book was pretty good but not great! I was a little disappointed but I've read many, many decorator books, so I guess I'm jaded, somewhat."
5,Favorite,I love all of David Sanborn's work. he is my favorite Smooth Jazz artist of all time!! Buy it!! You will love it too..
4,Desmond in his final setting,"Paul Desmond's final solo live shows were played with an excellent collection of Canadian musicians, including an excellent guitar played named Ed Bickert. Only a few records have been professionally released by this quartet, which is a shame because they had a distint down-tempo and cool sound and sported some of Desmonds most emotional and assured sax playing. This album is great for fans of the more laid back Desmond, and contains so treats like a version of the Desmond staple ""Tangerine."" Recently, however, another album was released on CD by Desmonds Canadian quartet titled ""The Paul Desmond Quartet Live,"" and although it's more of the same it outshines this release. It's a little bit more intense, a lot more emotional, and a whole lot more intimate than this release. The song choices for that concert were also stellar. ""Like Someone in Love"" is strongly recommended only for those who already have and enjoy ""The Paul Desmond Quartet Live."""
2,Catholics steer clear!,"This book does contain some touching and well written stories. However, for someone billed as a Catholic author, Ms. Roy seems much more interested in Buddhism and pantheism than in authentic Catholic spirituality. If you think those distinctions are irrelevant, you'll love this book. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
2,Unfortunate attempt at mainstream cross-over,"The earlier Buffalo Tom albums range from brilliant to amazing. The songwriting is fresh and the albums are decidedly underproduced. Unfortunately, whoever produced this album was listening to a lot of Rod Stewart... Instead of emotional vocals and interesting lyrics, they opted for cliche lyrics and a raspy ""pop"" vocal style. Pop music fans may like this album, but Buffalo Tom fans will probably be disappointed."
5,Like an old fashioned Railway?,"I was looking for a book on the Great Northern Railway (UK) signalling system and I found this one. What a totally interesting book on such a complex subject, with some amazing photos of how a very busy Railway system was safely controlled by a large and dedicated workforce. It would not happen these days of course, as such technology has long been made redundant.An enjoyable read and now a part of my extensive library of Railway related books."
5,Those you hear the least of often make the best noise,"I got turned onto Moonpools when I was working in a computer retail store in late '96 and there was a 30-second sample of ""Hear"" on the demo...after hearing it played over and over again I finally did some research and found out who it was. I immediately went out and bought the cd and it has probably been the cd I have listened to the most since. It always makes me feel good when I am down and has some of the best written lyrics out there today. It's only a shame that they never got much exposure in the mass media market. If you want to hear some music that just plain makes you smile...BUY THIS CD!!!"
3,Condition of Book Not as Advertised,"I received the used book, and CD in prompt timing; shipping was quick. However, my only complaint is the seller stated that there were no ""marks"" in the book. Practically every exercise had answers written in pencil, making it difficult to use the book's pages as homework. They are ""tear-out"" pages just for that. As a result, I retyped most of the homework, just because, the answers already written on the textbook were not my homework. Aside from that, everything else was truthful, and the price was very affordable. But if you've written in the book that you are selling, just say so!"
1,Verification Required,"Hi, just to let you know I believe in miracles and the gifts of the Spirit so don't get me wrong when I say this book has got theological issues.It's simply that the book seems to lack any kind of verification or any attempt at hinting at verification.This account differs from the Gospels and the Acts because it is so extremely vague.Everyone is identified in very blurry ways that there's absolutely no way on earth that any of this could be verified. I just closed the book and put it to one side, regretting ever considering distributing it. I knew there was something wrong.It is obvious how the writer himself even clutches at straws when he recounts himself and some other believers drinking water and God 'telling them' to say it is delicious wine. If you ever read that part of the book you will very quickly perceive how desperately it is stated, as if Mr. Tari is desperate to believe it's true no matter what.Don't waste your money or mind, rather buy God's Smuggler again."
5,Awesome!,"I can't begin to put into words how much I enjoyed this book. It was educational and gave me a new found respect for those who worked ""the road"". Galen just makes my heart swell as he becomes entranced w/La Petite Indigo. Her character is humble, hardworking and will inspire you with her die hard efforts to support those suffering from the horrors of slavery.You will absolutely love this book..."
5,AWESOME,"BEVERLY JENKINS WORK IN INDIGO, AS WELL AS ALL OF HER OTHER WORKS ARE SIMPLY WONDERFUL. THE HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS BLENDED WITH THE ROMANCE IS DONE SO MASTERFULLY. BEVERLY PLEASE HURRY AND WRITE ANOTHER BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,lloviendo mucho cade,"primero antes que nada, esta coleccion de juan luis guerra es estupenda, llena de canciones extraordinarias y un sentimiento unico. juan luis guerra is much more than a songwriter; he is a poet that share his gift with us with his beautiful lyrics and melodies. this album as the previous ones are deserving more than 5 stars.....they are masterpieces!"
3,The Kindle edition sucks,"I like the content of this book and would give it 5 stars, but unfortunately the Kindle edition is plagued not just by the usual hard to read tables and graphs, but also lack of hyperlinks to the footnotes and tables.This book has lots of references to footnotes and tables and graphs, and without clickable links it's very awkward to refer to these and get back to your text.I recommend just getting the hard copy of this book."
5,"not my usual genre... but, what a surprise!","I don't usually read historical novels, and it took me 3 tries to get through the first gory battle - but I ended up LOVING this book!! I picked it up one summer sunday, looking for light reading and I ended up reading the whole book in one sitting - I was completely unable to put it aside.This book is extremely well researched. The plot is interesting, the characters are fascinating and the historical details are wonderful (although I could have gladly lived my life forever not knowing what exactly ""kealhauling"" was - ew!).I highly recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in not only piracy but in a well crafted depiction of the roles that were thrust upon women and minorities by society in the 1700's.I *also* highly recommend a sequel!! (I hope the author takes note.)"
2,Does not help with posture,"While this can help with support especially when you lift stuff a lot, I found that it didn't help correct my posture at all which is why I bought it. I was disappointed."
1,"Had to return it, does not work","Windows 7 found it and installed a driver. Works with a USB 3.0 external drive, but not with other USB 2.0 devices. A waste of money."
3,Took too long,This book is short and to the point. it took a long time to get to me. I could not see a tracking code.
5,so cute,we got this for our mother who has everything lady bug and we though this would be practical and display
5,Ladybug Photo Frame,"This frame although small, is beautiful. It was very special for my daughter in law. It has a special meaning."
2,Hot Babes and Hot Lead,"Sistas in da hood. Looking for revenge and bling bling. Except da hoodis a wild west town in the late 1800s. I do not remember any westernslike this when I was growing up. What would Randolph Scott say? If hesaw Lil' Kim, he might say, ""Alright! I have to admit that I tuned intothis just to see her. Bare midriffs and low cut blouses are not thestaple of the usual cowboy flick, but these are the cowgirls, and theyare fine.Now, don't go looking for any major story here, and the usual stuff ofghetto crime drama are here in a different setting. And, when's thelast time you heard John Wayne call someone, ""Dawg""? And, I don'tremember the Earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched tothe OK Corral.I watch this on BET, so I missed the action that got it an R rating,but I doubt if I will buy the DVD to see it unless I can be assured itwas Lil' Kim in that action."
4,Entertaining,"You you like Black films, you will enjoy this one too. It's not the best, but definitely not the worst. The star casting did a fairly good job in their acting. I would recommend this film."
1,"You mean, this WASN'T a comedy?","I watched this movie with some of my co-workers, and we were ON THE FLOOR! Gang of Roses was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Unfortunately, it was meant to be a serious western. Gang of Roses is not even remotely worth buying or renting. However, the accidental comedy makes a great argument for illegal copying (which I am against and would never do)."
3,Nice but you get what you pay for,"Nice system, a real bonus that it plays MP3's. The system sound quality is adequate. For some reason DVD's don't play too loud... loud enough though for most situations."
2,it's not a changer!,5 CD/DVD changer but unable to change disk without totally stopping playing.Good sound otherwise.
4,This package is great; here's what I'd like to say,"BAD:- The box says 400 Watts but that's not it- Hardwire at the sat. speaker's end; if you want to hang sat. speakers at corners of a big room, the included wires are too short and there's only one way to do it is to ""hand"" connect your extended wire to the ends of included wires- It takes quite a while to change discs; the disc indicate lights run back and forth between 5 of them to just change from disc 1 to 2- Cannot play MP3 songs randomly; by default, most MP3 files are sorted ascendingly by artist's name in the CD therefore the MP3 songs are played in that order only- Once in a while you would want to adjust bass and treble; this cannot be doneGOOD:- Good surround sound when playing DVD movie- With 5 disc changer and MP3 playback, it plays all 5x150 MP3 songs all day/night long- Made in Malaysia which lasts longer than made in China or Taiwan- Great sub-woofer- Looks real nice, especially sat. speakers hung on corners of room"
3,Kindle PC is NOT for students.,"This is my text book and I was hoping to get quick download which was very easy. However, I can't seem tosee page numbers on PC version. I checked the settings but there is no setting.There's nothing wrong with the book but minor inconvenience using Kindle PC version."
3,works for me,"I've had this case for about 1 1/2 years. I use it for my Vito-Yangisawa bari. The fit is fine.I only use the case once a week for a jam session I attend, so its just for storage and transport by myself in my car.It still looks brand new. Nothing is broken and its not too heavy. The storage pocket works for my harnesses, reeds and other stuff.There is a stuffer sleeve that came with it. I place the neck and my mouthpiece in it, the mouthpiece is already in a protective sleeve of its own, and that goes inside the bell of the horn.Works for me.Given the price, its a good choice. Don't know how well it would hold up to transport by non-musicians."
2,Movie play only on the computer,"The movie was great had to watch the movie on the computer. This was some kind of copy from a different country. I think Germany....and it was different. The movie was good, sad, and different for Julia Roberts. The company was great and on time to get the movie. Price was a little high for the type of movie."
5,Red Noise=White Music,"I've been a huge admirer of Uncle Bill since I bought the first BeBopDeluxe LP. He has been a major influence on the music I make. I have everything of his, on vinyl, bought new when released, and most of the recent solo work (CD's of course).Here's an inportant observation about this release: Drastic Plastic and (mostly) Red Noise were both massively influenced by XTC's ""White Music"" from 1978, much more so than any other post-punk, proto new wave music that was developing at the time. ""Sound-on-Sound"" is a great album; I have always loved it. But I think credit goes to XTC for how unique this album is."
2,Defective product made in China not Germany,"I bought the Rosle system expecting German quality and engineering. This product arrived obviously defective with an end piece that was obviously broken and yet the product was still packaged and sent to me. This is a big bulky item so not an easy return and I didn't install the item immediately so Amazon won't handle a return after one month. I'll be contacting the manufacturer directly for a replacement part. Once the replacement part arrives, it appears as if the product will work well. This is why I gave two stars rather than one. But a bother and a disappointment for what should be a very good quality product."
4,Good clone battery but not made by Energizer,"This Nikon EN-EL3 clone battery has the same specs as the ""genuine"" Nikon EN-EL3 battery (for D100, D70 and others). Even though it bears the Energizer brand, this is made by an OEM called Technuity which is a licensee of the Energizer brand. The issue is I don't know if Energizer stands behind the quality of this battery, and you are really using it at your own risk. It does get hot after extended use, but so does Nikon's own EN-EL3 (which is likely manufactured by an OEM anyway). This clone does come with a 3-year warranty, but no ""equipment warranty,"" so if it should explode or melt in your Nikon camera, they are not responsible for it.Tip: after charging completes, do not leave the battery charged for more than another hour. Also don't use the camera for a long period of time (my definition is more than 30 minutes non-stop)."
3,alright for the price,"The scarf is a handy, warm accessory, but it isn't nearly as soft as I had hoped. Also, after only one wash the fringe has come undone and the fabric is starting to get holes."
3,Avon Barksdale-The Wire,"If u r into the Wire this will be interesting,not the best documentary, but did tell about the real ""don't call me"" ""Avon"",only for those who loved the show the Wire"
3,Pizza Knife Review,"Product does the job, but the steel could have been thicker with a larger handle on the top to grip. It is good that there are no wood or plastic parts on this knife incorporating crevasses where food and foreign material can get into, or bacteria can grow. Product also has a convenient factory set hole so you can hang it in your kitchen. The product does however come with a sticker on it that has an adhesive difficult to remove unless you know how: nail polish remover, or furniture polish when allowed to soak in, should do the trick."
3,Stick with their original albums,"I discovered HEM in order of their released albums, starting with Rabbit Songs and then continuing on with Eveningland. If you, like me, own both of those albums already, I honestly wouldn't bother with No Word From Tom. I'd say at least half the CD is tracks from Eveningland and the rest is covers. It's not worth it.I just saw them in concert last night and they mentioned that they were just in the recording studio for 6 weeks. If you are a diehard fan like I am just wait for this completely new album instead of investing in a half album."
4,My Favorite Hem Collection,I am a huge Hem fan but hearing this album makes me really appreciate them even more. The live songs are worth having and they were recorded as well as the studio songs. The covered songs here are great too. This album seems to have more of a variety of sound and mood to it. I instantly loved it.
1,Condition of book in question,"The art is great. The commentary is nice to read. My problems with this item have nothing to do with it's content. I received this item with damage to the dust cover. Pretty bad, too. The material seperated, peeling back on the dust cover, causing a large whitish area visible on the cover. Then the replacement had similar damage to the dust jacket on the spine. Amazon told me that this is a wide-spread problem as of the last time I talked with them, 4/20/05. So, if you want the book, but don't care what condition the dust cover is in, order away. If you care about the apearance of the book, look elsewhere."
4,Winter [Notes from Montana],"Winter [notes from Montana] takes place in the extreme northern outskirts of the United States, in a small area called the Yaak Valley. The author, Rick Bass, states in the book ""This valley shakes with mystery, with secrets - and yet it gives up no answers. I sometimes believe that this valley - so high up in the mountains, and in such heavy woods - is like a step up to heaven, the last place you go before the real thing""(p. 61). In this paragraph Bass sums up what he thinks about his new home. I think for Bass this place is the closest thing to heaven. He spends the whole book describing the mystery, beauty, and secrets of the valley to us. I don't think he will ever figure out the mystery of the valley, and I believe he will love dying trying to figure the secrets out. I enjoyed reading this well-written book; it almost made me want to move to a more secluded area for a while. I repeat ALMOST!"
1,A Moron In Nature,"Everything you need to know about this book can be summed up in the following: This writer, a supposed environmentalist from Texas, who spends most of the book complaining about loss of forest and pollution, nevertheless spends most of his winter cutting wood with a chainsaw so that he can heat his greenhouse until it's sweating hot -- like the land he left to come up north -- and exercise while he stares out at the snow.This is a textbook of how to be both smug and oblivious, how NOT to approach nature. I wonder whether he even realizes how stupid, self-righteous, and hypocritical he sounds in this."
5,This book is one of the best around.,"I have read many of the love stories series and this is one of my favorites. The characters are so real and epople can relate to them.The problems are ones that teenagers realy face, like Allie's self conciousnes around Ben. This is one of the best books ever."
4,Good Read-,I really enjoyed reading this book.. but I thought it was a little predicatable at times. I would reccomend for a curl yourself up on the couch rainy day book! I love The Love Stories Series!
3,Finding ground,"This album is not the best of aphex's works, but it's the not the worst either. I think he was trying to define his own sound here, moving away from ambient-techno and towards something he wasn't quite sure of. I don't think he truely knew what he was quite aiming for until he heard Squarepusher!! Then all hell broke loose and 'Richard D James' was born, which is a brilliant album."
3,Depends on what you expect,"This book is a meandering discussion of influences and variations on the theme of colonial revival architecture and includes some tasty pictures. However, it is not a stylistic reference with specific, prescriptive descriptions of what is generally envisioned as colonial revival. If you're hoping for proper paint schemes and/or the millwork detailing and proportions or plans you'll be disappointed. Still, some of the photographs were beauts..."
4,Another solid entry,"This is another fun, and fresh, book in Drake's Lt. Leary series. No surprises, easy reading, enjoyable action -- mindless, mind popcorn that fall is between WEB Griffin at the mindless end and CS Forester at the higher."
2,Fun,I remember when this video was on TV. Its fun to watch Blue Eyed White People trying to look like Native Americans. What a bunch of Clowns. This mostly just a bunch junk. Anyhow have fun.
2,Pretty but uninteresting,"I had heard a review of some of her work and was excited to listen to the full CD. She certainly has a lovely voice, but rarely challenges her range and has surrounded herself with an unchallenging light jazz- kenny G'esque ensemble."
1,One of the worst printers ever,"I was excited to buy this printer over a year ago, but now I just want to throw it out the window. First off, from the very beginning the software didn't always work right with my Windows XP. Anytime a document had to be cancelled, I had to reboot my computer in order to print anything else because the pending documents list would freeze up. Then there's the usual problem with not getting much usage out of an ink cartridge. But now, the paper feed doesn't work, requiring about ten attempts and usually a manual insertion of paper to get the paper to feed into the printer. The scanning feature works well, but copy quality isn't all that good, and scanning pictures also distorts the image quality quite a bit. All in all, I'm very disappointed in Lexmark and will never buy another."
5,Great Printer for Small/Home Office,"It installed flawlessly under XP. The only thing I will say is make sure the cartridges are seated properly, that cost me a couple of minutes. Copies just fine for short runs in either color or b&w. Included software is fantastic and walks even a simpleton through the basics of everything you can do. Print quality is fantastic for color and b&w text, photos are fine also. Paper does have a tendency to jam a bit so you need to be careful in loading it. Very satisfied with this printer and I own several."
2,computer literate,"We ordered ours from Dell - the first one wouldn't turn on, so we had to go through the ordeal of shipping it back or they wouldn't refund it. The second one had a broken scanner piece, which was also unfixable - sent THAT one back. Third one works, but jams the paper. This is not a product I would ever recommend, nor would I recommend Lexmark Customer Service, as out of the 8 people I spoke to there, ZERO were fluent English-language speakers and therefore couldn't diagnose any problems."
1,Big Mistake,"This printer does a fine job about 40% of the time, the other 60% of the time it is ""not communicating"" with my computer. In less than a year, I have had to reinstall the driver 4 times. The price of the new ink cartridges really caught me off guard, 1 each of the black and color cartridges cost more than the printer. I have reclaimed my old Epson Stylus from the kid's computer room and the Lexmark is about to take a trip to the Goodwill, hopefully someone else will have better luck than I have."
3,great price but problems,have the lexmark for 3 weeks... after paper jam status light will not turn off ... it cannot be fixed... called lexmark and they are replacing it with a new one... in 3-5 days... had a HP for ten years and no problem... returning the lexmark tomorrow
3,Good Examples,"I used this book for a 400 level course on Probability Theory. The problems are very tough, but the examples help you understand probability pretty well. Although it's hard to make introductory math real exciting, this book is not nearly as dry as some others."
2,Just a Typical Intro Book,"Some other reviewer said Sheldon Ross deserves a Nobel Prize for this book, but that's a gross overstatement. Another reviewer said he'll burn the book, but it's not that bad either. It's a fairly typical intro book that's neither particularly good nor bad. The problems were at an appropriate level and were definitely doable if reasonable time was put in. Ross explains the concepts decently well, but I found William Feller's Intro to Mathematical Probability a much better presentation of the material. The part that I despised about Ross is his exposition of various types of random variables. This was the part where the book got truly boring, since his style was ""this is binomial. got it? this is possion. ok. and this is exponential."" There was no sense of flow or connection. For this I give him 2 stars although I would have given him 3 otherwise."
2,Alexandra D Pima Student Elem Math,I read this to a group of kindergarten students who had made an inchworm in class for the letter 'I'. The students enjoyed the pictures and how the inchworm would measure the veggies. However I would not reccomend this book for this grade unless you are reading it for fun because most of the students do not grasp the concept of the inches.
3,Like it ok.,Thought it would be a little better but still enjoyed it. Was hoping for more words but the ones included were good.
2,not much,"Really is not much in this book nor does it explain much. it only covers a few signs. I would go with signing to babies for dummies, very small price difference and a lot more coverage."
5,Lisa's easy listening style is wonderful...,I met Lisa last year in San Diego and received this CD personally autographed. She has a wonderful style of soul searching harmony. I highly recommend this CD...
5,The Phish Are Biting Well Today,"This is an excellent concert by an excellent band. There is not much I can say about this excellent concert The sound quality is wonderful. The jams are breathtaking, I cant listen to them enough. This album is a triumph of music and every one should take part in enjoying it. Great for Phish fans, or people who just love music herself. You will not regret buying this great CD."
4,A pleasantly surprised listener PHISH A LIVE ONE,"I'll admit I am the last person in the world who would listen to Phish, i like long improvisations, and all that stuff, its just i did not think this band would be for me, I thought it would be too simplistic to sustain the length of the tracks(thats the jazz buff in me talking). I dont know why I thought that, I had not even heard the music,when I finally heard some Phish, which happened to be this cd, my mind changed. Im not a hardcore fan or anything, I own this cd and thats it, it is very good, but Im not gonna go buy all their albums or anything, I'll take it slowly."
3,good starting place...but not nessicarily essential,"This is a good place to start for new Phish phans to get a good idea of what the concert experience is about. But overall, not one to convert new ones. The band plays wonderfully throughout and it is a lot of fun, but I kinda have to side with those on the anti-""Tweezer"" side. Don't get me wrong, I do like it; the playing is fun...but after awhile, it just doesn't GO anywhere. 30 minutes is a LONG time. This is one of those discs I take with me on long trips...it's a good start for those who want initiation into the live experience. For beginners I recommend ""A Picture of Nectar"". Not bad though. And worth the price of admission for ""Bouncing Round the Room"", ""Gumbo"", and ""Wilson""."
4,PHISH anyone?,"I have been an avid Phish phan for about eight years now and ""A Live One"" is a great live album for the uninitiated in the Phish style, for the rest of us its just pretty good. ""You Enjoy Myself"", ""Harry Hood"" and ""The Squirming Coil"" are all magnificent on here but ""Gumbo"", ""Chalkdust Torture"" and the lame-o two minute ""Tweezer"" cut ""Montana"" are below standard. Phish is a band of many, many different styles and techniques and this album limits them to their ""new fan friendly"" songs, or only songs people will attend shows to see like the classic Phish song everyone knows, ""Bouncing Around The Room"". Do yourself a favor, go see Phish a few times then get a tape of a live show, it may open your eyes a bit more..."
4,Excellent Singer!,I had this CD when I was 14 or 15 and I Love it. Michael Speaks is an Excellent singer. He can hit the highs and lows just like a girl... This is an excellent CD. Just listen to it....
3,Steel,"I have read and been told by many people to not use the stainless steel type of brushes because they can scratch the inside of the barrel. Go with the brass ones and be safe, they won't scratch."
1,"wispy, ethereal and by now cliche",This is predictable stylistic treatment of standard songs by someone who may eventually sound more eccentric than anything else to future listeners.
1,Better choices available,"It's not that hard to create a great Christmas Album, and it' hard to believe a talent like Sarah McLachlan created Wintersong. This is a boring Christmas album. The song selection is partially to blame as each song is slower than the next. In my opinion, this album completely fails to capture the joy of the holiday. The songs while well done are not anything special or memorable. None of Sarah's versions of these classic Christmas tunes is a standout and I doubt they will be remembered past this Christmas. I was very disappointed."
4,Seasonal Sarah,"It took me a while to warm up to this album, but in the end the songs that I was initally disappointed in somehow became my favorites - go figure ! Her version of Noel is intriquingly unique - I'm sorry that the holidays are over, maybe I'll listen one more time . . . ."
4,The divine Sarah's Christmas album,"Sarah McLachlan makes interesting and unexpected choices on this holiday collection, and for the most part, the efforts pay off for the listener. ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"" could scarcely be more relevant today. I love the Middle Eastern flavor to ""The First Noel/Mary Mary"" -- Jesus of Nazareth was, after all, born in the Middle East. Besides the holiday chestnuts, Sarah covers Joni Mitchell's ""River"" (not a traditional Xmas song, but one that makes reference to the holiday) and Gordon Lightfoot's ""Song for a Winter Night"" to good effect. The closing tune, collaborating w/Diane Krall on Vince Guaraldi's immortal ""Christmas Time Is Here,"" is lovely."
3,Not what I expected,An interesting CD but one I could live without. Nicely performed but very average - nothing to put one over the top with Christmas spirit.
5,Xmas music that excites!,"While I am not a huge fan of Xmas music, it tends to get very old very quick, this disc by La Sarah is one of THE best holiday albums out there. Her voice is in top form and she gets extra bonus points for including my fave Xmas song...""What Child Is This?"" I really wish she were doing a small, intimate holiday tour for this. It would be divine."
5,A welcome addition to my holiday music collection!,"I have been a devoted fan of Sarah's for 12 years now, and have long wished she would release a holiday album. Wintersong was worth the wait! Sarah's voice is unlike anyone else's, and I can't think of anyone else I'd rather listen to while trimming my tree. Congratulations to Sarah on another wonderful release."
1,terrible,The little stainless steel ball on top constantly comes loose. This thing drove us nuts. We returned it for the Peugeot U-Select Chateauneuf Black Matte Salt and it works much better (it also grinds better)
3,No Music Videos...Less than Stellar Collection,"I would read the other reviews for more info, but when I found out these were released without the music video parodies, I set my expectations low for this collection.I grew up with In Living Color, and many skits and sketches I found very funny, even at such a young age. One of the highlights were their musical parodies on some of the big artists at the time. That was one of the reasons that prompted me to add the collection to my Wish List and save up to buy it.Long story short, the collection is still good, but not as good as it could have been without the music videos. They even cut them from the credits!If you want the music videos, you're better off getting them from a site like YouTube."
4,Back in the Day.......,"This set brought back a whole lot of great memories since it was the ""old school days"" for a lot of us! I'm looking forward to seeing the upcoming seasons!!! Can't wait!!!"
3,Aged,"I loved ""In Living Color"" over a decade ago. It felt very aged when I watched the first season on DVD last night. I think the show was so great because it was so fresh and up to the minute but it is not 1990 anymore. One of my favorite bits, the ""Men on film"" segment, discussed movies that have long been forgotten in my mind and I suspect in the mind of many. Sure there are still great scenes and I still laughed out loud on occasion, but not to the degree I did fourteen years. I really wanted to be able to write a good review of this legendary television show, but I find that to be impossible. Sorry."
5,Strotime,I was just talkin wit my boys about this. It's about doggone time. This show is DA BOMB! You should buy this set!
5,The Greatest Sketch Comedy Show EVER,"""In Living Color"" was undoubtedly the most original, bawdy, hilarious comedy program television has ever seen, and nothing has come close to it before or since. The show bridged the gap between black and white audiences by at once exploiting sterotypes and then proving how ridiculous they could be, without being politically correct or preachy, and never without the aid of top-notch humor. The writing was spectacular, each of the performers were incredibly talented, and the chemistry between them showed.Unlike ""Saturday Night Live"" or ""Mad TV"", in which one must sit through many terribly unfunny sketches to wait for the favorites, there was no need to wait for the good stuff on ""In Living Color"". All of it was in your face, laugh-out-loud, cover-your-mouth comedy! And at last it is on DVD, and reasonably priced to top it off. I can't wait until April 6, 2004!!"
5,Intense,"So many ""gay"" poets write tired, boring, clichéd poems about gay experience. What a surprise to find a poet who can tackle gay issues without dumbing down the poems. Some wrenching, harsh, stunning poems here. Every reader, gay or straight, have experienced some of the emotions that guide the speaker of these poems. Unlike the majority of contemporary poetry, these poems have something to say and actually ""says"" it well. No boring academic tricks to wade through. After reading it, I can see why there is so much buzz about this book."
4,Pretty good book,"I ended up buying , reading, and actually liking this book, but not necessarily because of the poetry itself. Some of it's a bit bad, with clunky words and phrases that sometimes wander into seemingly unrelated vagueness, though some of the images and lines are really good. What I really like about this book is what Cole has to say: his feelings, struggles, and perspective on himself and the world around him. It's intense and powerful, just like some of the other reviews say."
3,Pick me,"This is a great dvd to purchase if you are a fan, or just want to taste his style. I have seen Issacs live and this dvd is just like being at the show."
1,Rehash of the IRS Regulations,"This is a very disappointing book. Essentially, it is a regurgitation of the IRS regulations on a number of estate planning issues. There is no interpretation, no attempt to simplify or clarify for the reader, and worst of all no advice on tax planning strategy given particular issues or circumstances. What do these regs mean? How should they be interpreted? What do they allow the estate planner to do and not to do? What is the most advantageous interpretation of the jprovisions? This book gives not a clue. For me, it was a waste of $145."
4,A must see drama,"This film depicts the very best of the mental state that people in the Eastern Block have developed during the half a century of atrocious regime installed by the Bolsheviks at the end of the World War II. If you ever wondered how people could resist under inhumane conditions imposed by dictatorships, you ought to see this movie and you'll find your answers."
5,Very tough,"One of the best cases out there. Housed my computer through some very rough conditions, including one genius that used it for a chock block (my computer still in it). Both my computer and the case are still in excellent condition."
5,Ear Bud Earphones: Don't get you in trouble,"As with my old gameboy, I was always being yelled at constantly to turn down the volume. And now the GBA with stereo sound, I must get the best music and sound experience. So I went out and bought these ear phones, and they've helped me a lot. I can turn up the volume to it's loudest setting and no one will ever hear. I recommend these."
4,I think this CD is great!,"Not quite as good as its previous CD, but this one still shows that sweet water could put out a great rock album. Nobody particularly sticks out as incredible in this group, but they are all very good musicians, and the way that they fit together perfectly is what makes Superfriends, as well as the last album, as great as they are."
2,"No, no, no - maybe",This album is okay at best and takes some getting used to - it is nothing like any description I read of it. It's poppy riff rock with an okay singer. not worth much more than the shipping.
4,Good Recovery from Album 2,"After the second album (which contained many duplicates from the locally produced debut), I was almost ready to give up on these guys until I saw them at a Fraternity party in Pullman just before this album was released. IMHO, this is the best Sweet Water album because of the consistent quality from one song to the next. It does sound more 'poppy' than the original, but well worth adding to the collection. I have played it for several non-fans and they really liked it as well. Superstar, and No Syrup... are both worth the album."
3,A pretty good book,"I used this book and did very well on the SAT. Thank you somuch. HOwever, in some places it's a little lacking.."
4,"Gripping, fast-paced and unexpected.","This book is a fascinating psychological thriller that will disturb you and make you think twice before you smile back to anybody, much less give your number to anyone you don't know.Nicci French is an expert when it comes down to the horror and frustration of watching your predator smile at you from afar.The tension in the book builds up on every page and you end up rooting for Miranda and her apparently crazy behavior.The final unexpected twist will leave you stunned."
4,Tricks,The cast of characters is one of the best created. Multiple conflicts between good and evil with a laugh thrown in for good measure. Easy reading that provides its main purpose in that of entertaining. Plan to read the whole series by the end of the year.
2,Pages falling out,The book is very good but unfortunately arrived with almost all the pages falling out. What do I have to do?
5,Perfect Gift for a Great Friend!,"I gifted this book to my friend Arthur who moved to Chicago lately. He went on a cruise with his dad and they ended up having a great time!! The folded towels on his bed is what he most recalled about the trip, so I gave him this book so he could do it himself! And it reminds him of the great times with his dad while he's away in Chicago. It was a perfect gift - he LOVED it!!!"
2,uses too may towels,"I did not like this book because it uses too many towels and most of them have to be gigantic towels, not the normal sized towels most of us have. I took the book back."
3,The Lost Art of Towel Origami,I was very interested in learning Towel Origami. The size of the pieces and the number of towels needed to create them made the task almost impossible.
3,network a printer with Linksys WUSB54GC Wireless-G USB Adapter??,Does anyone know if this adapter can be used to network a printer? Just plug into usb port of printer should seemingly network it????
4,December Review,"I purchased the Linksys WUSB54GC Wireless - G Adapter. The device arrived on time and in great condition. We discovered the cable accompanying the device did not work. No harm, the device fits into the USB port on the back of the PC."
4,I liked this product,This product was easy to install and use. The directions were easy to follow and it was working in less than ten minutes.
1,Not Vista compatible,"I used this for years with my XP system. If your system is XP use it....but it's not Vista compatible.I had to replace my computer. I tried the ""new"" drivers, I googled solutions, nothing worked. I had to get a Vista compatible USB adapter."
3,Ok Performance IF you avoid Software,"I just bought one for home use, but bought one for work over a year ago. I installed software that came with it and newer version on the web and had nothing but trouble. Once I got it working it would stop working after restart until you take it out remove drivers and put back in. THEN I decided to just use windows built in wireless zero config. Removed software put adapter in and no problem since. Its range is a bit lower than I expected, though it does have to go through solid brick walls (School) to get to router. If you buy this I'd suggest manually installing the drivers (point to drivers on found new device) and ONLY the drivers rather than running any program from the CD as many seem to have issues with the included software."
1,I couldn't believe I ran into so many issues with this wireless adapter,"I couldn't believe I ran into so many issues with this wireless adapter,Issue 1: Is it compact? No, it is bigger then I thought. I had to use the USB extension cable to be able to plug it in to my USB slot.Issue 2: The Wireless-G Adapter didn't fit the extension cable. The adapter just couldn't stay with the extension cable because it fit very very loosely when I plugged it into the cable together. And, because of that, my PC would be detecting new hardware when I touched the adapter.Issue 3: The monitoring software came with the wireless adapter used 50% of my cpu (2.4GHz). When I figured that out, I had to turn off the monitoring to get decent performance.Issue 4: The configuration wizard coming with the adapter was so confusing that I had to switch to Windows'Wireless Zero Configuration."
1,Worthless adapter,The Linksys WUSB54GC adapter is a worthless product & now it is in my junk pile. I purchased it a few months ago to use with a new desktop PC (Vista). It never worked well; often took up to 10 minutes to get a connection & the connection often was lost. Replaced it with a Netgeat Wireless N adapter (WN111). Easy to set up and the Netgear adapter works perfectly.
1,waisted $,"We could not get it to work. we had bought a new router, linksys, so bought an adapter to go with it for the bedroom. Would not work, so we used the old adapter and it was easily installed. it was the same adapter company, but the new style would not download with the cd"
4,Linksys USB Wifi,This product works fine. I have a computer in my house that is quite a ways from the wifi router and upstairs. It connects just fine with my old router. Don't know why I didn't do this sooner
1,Windows 7 - WON'T WORK!!!,Tried to install on my 64 bit windows 7 computer and it didn't work. Tried to install it with the disc and nothing happened... Beware if your computer specs are as mine...
3,CISCO Wireless Adapter,"I purchased several of these and they seem to work OK. Installation sets up the adapter to be managed by CISCO software. Sometimes I have found that the SW can drop the network.... and this has required some maintenance to get it restarted. The problem is that it only happens every few months..... so you tend to forget what you did the last time to get it restarted. I think it would be simpler if Windows managed the device instead.... but so far I have not been able to figure out how to setup Windows to do so. In general the device works reliably..... but as noted tends to drop the wireless connection now and then. Most of the time it can recover itself... but every few months it does not, requiring manual intervention to reconnect."
5,plug and play,Great item awesome very user friendly put the cd in install plug and play easy as that.
1,Ade's Reviews,"It took too long to get this product, almost 2-3 weeks. These people continued to send me emails about the adapter but did not send it for some odd reason. I would not recommend this company to anyone. The service was extremely poor. I hate waiting, If I pay for a product, I expect to get it quick. This had never happend to me with Amazon before. I am never going to order from this on company again. I am not the type to rate service with Amazon and this is my first time doing this. I felt like I had to do this to inform others of the service that I had gotten. DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!!!!!! Amazon is wonderful, I am talking about the company that dispatched the adapter."
3,usb adapter,Haven't been able to get it to work on our laptop. Thought I could follow the directions that came with it and I would be logged on to our server which is [..]. Will keep trying.
4,Wireless connection,"I recently bought this Linksys compact wireless adapter and I must say it was a good investment. Sure getting a span of cat6 wire is cheaper, but who really wants a huge wire tagging along with you, nevermind the problems that go with it. I use it with my gaming computer (desktop) and can play Call of Duty 4 without any problems, and a low ping. The only thing I can say against it, is that I have had a few minor problems with the software that comes with it, but noting that would stop even the computer-illiterate, just enough to be an occasional hassle. All in all, if you want a wireless adapter, this one is a good choice."
2,Enjoyable film but horrible DVD,"I bought this for Cassandra Cat, which is difficult to find. The film is enjoyable, but the transfer to DVD is just about the worst I've ever seen for any film. Buyer beware! First of all, this is widescreen film that has been reduced to 4:3 ratio without any panning. Often you're not sure what you're looking at because the important part is cut off. It looks like the source material was a bad videotape. The image is fuzzy and hard to see, the color comes and goes, and there are nasty compression artifacts. Internet video looks many times better. I agree with another reviewer that the dubbing is well done.In Carnival Story, the sound vanishes for 10 minutes. You're better off looking for this one for free on the Internet since it's apparently now in the public domain."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"Other reviewers gave this mic low marks due to poor sound quality. Indeed, it was pretty bad. I was looking (and still am) for a good omnidirectional mic for use with a Cisco 9951 phone. But the sound quality was too bad, so I am sending the mic back. I also plugged it into a laptop and had similar results."
3,COMIC BOOK!,"I thought this would be a really-real bookie-wookie, but even better!It was comic!YAH!Not to metion, I'm Stella's younger twin, not that looser on the Welcome To Magix DVD!"
1,...,"...been in the shop many times, total of 6 months, and have had techs come out over 20 times. Replace tubes and 2 other parts of different occasions. Panasonic wouldn't replace the TV and now it is out of warranty and is still broken. Panasonic has said sorry but you are out of luck. Called them probably 40 times over past year and a half, but of course they only have record of a couple. If you buy it, definately get the extended warranty. Didn't work since the first week I had it. Beaware of what you a getting in to..."
1,NEVER AGAIN,"I bought this about 5 years ago and I thought it would last at least 10, I was wrong. At first I thought it was a cable problem but the other ""non-panasonic"" tvs I have works fine. I have a sony tv for over 12 years and it works better than this one. First it took a while to show a picture then it started taking longer and longer everytime I opened it until the next day it just didn't want to open anymore. Never again will I buy a panasonic, and the funny thing my panasonic vcr broke down about a month ago. Maybe my tv got depressed and decided it couldn't go on without the vcr."
2,Disappointed,I expected more from a broadcast with such a flashy title. All you see are some divers going down into an 80 feet deep well in murky waters. That's the whole descent! Over after five minutes! The rest is interesting but nothing really exciting.
4,"Buy this book, if only for Lansdowne's novella.","Three novellas in which women set out to reform rakes, though only one of the rakes really seems to qualify as a cad in need of reforming. The best of the three is Judith Lansdowne's and her rake has the soul of an artist, though he does have a horse no one else can ride. His story is full of good fun and high adventure, and it's worth the price of the paperback all by itself."
5,Oscar in Paris,Excellent ensemble playing; very intuitive and balanced. A must for any serious jazz collection.
1,The author is a kinsman and I really wanted the text.,"But, the production was not very good and some pages are poorly reproduced. Frankly, I could have found an equally poor quality copy on one of the Web book search engines and printed a copy on my printer.I do expect better quality from Amazon.But, the original book is as insightful and interesting as it was when written more then hundred years ago. So, if you are like me and any quality copy bound is better then nothing, it is for you. If you need quality print copy, keep looking."
2,Ego driven...,"I agree with the other reviewer, John J. Thompsons band the wayside is mentioned way too much. I have heard them and they are not that good."
5,Great fun!,"Letty Campbell, a chicken farmer in England, sells part of her property to a woman from Texas who's establishing a health resort. Letty's mother, newly engaged, has been receiving mysterious phone calls, which may be from her husband-to-be's estranged daughter. When Letty's car is driven off the road, she can't help but think she's targeted, but by whom? Is it connected to a local escaped convict, or to the health club next door? Letty would much rather spend time with her new girlfriend, than get involved in yet another mystery, but she finds that sometimes there's no choice. It's a thrilling and exciting mystery from an author who deserves more attention here in the U.S."
1,don't buy this,"please don't buy this tv if you plan on using th s-video input. they are all defective and when they come out to do the modification to fix it, it merely reduces the severity of the vertical lines that run across the screen. they say that this is a tolerable defect and refuse to replace or fix tv completely. SHAME ON PANASONIC"
3,alright,I really only like about 3 songs on this CD but it is okay. It isn't what I would have chose to list as their greatest hits but my husband really likes it. He has listened to it several times. The Cd arrived in great shape and in a timely manner. Thanks.
5,A Literary Gamble,"Dostoevsky's Last Night is a daring and unexspected ride through rick and redemption by an author who is obviously not afraid to take risks. In this dazzling novel, Jorge, a passionate and eccentric man addicted to gambling seeks help with Lucia, his shrink. But instead of finding the accepting and caring person he was looking for Lucia attempts to cure him with straitforward no nonsence opinions and caustic advice, which causes Jorge to become more fond of her than he exspected. The plot, however, is not the most interesting part of Dostoevsky's Last Night -- the ideas are. Rossi moves through her novel with incredible grace, showing both the beauty and the tyranny of passion. Borrowing from numerous psychological, literary, and popular influences she constructs a book that burns with all the passion of the gambling table but with much more certainty of comming out a winner."
5,"Smart, sexy book about a man addicted to gambling","A sexy, intelligent book about a man who defines himself by his addictions (in his case it is too gambling). An idea novel, plus just a moving story full of hope."
2,Hitting bottom...,"The addition of a Rodgers-clone marked a new era of decline for Bad Co.after the short and succesful stint with Brian Howe.Hart is a competent singer,however,the new songs lack power and inspiration,aspiring too much at the glories of the past 1970's era.Bad Company imitating themselves."
5,Bad Company Returns To Its Roots With A New Singer,"On COMPANY OF STRANGERS, Bad Company replaces lead singer Brian Howe with the Paul Rodgers-influenced Robert Hart, returns to its roots in the Memphis-Chicago-Texas-St. Louis-Louisiana-Detroit-Philadelphia-Kansas City blues/R&B/soul/rock & roll axis, and releases its best album since 1979's DESOLATION ANGELS. Gone are all the pop affectations of the last five albums, replaced with a raw, dry sound reminiscent of the first three albums and any number of Southern boogie bands. There are numerous great rockers here, but the most riveting moment is the ballad ""Little Martha"", a sad tale of child mortality that reminds me of seeing children's tombstones while hiking around historical sites to get in shape for my favorite female celebrities. I'd love to ask a cute girl for a dance to this one and the first five with Rodgers, even if this girl doesn't quite fit that ""little mold"" that others think she should."
4,Best one in years,"Bad Company with singer Paul Rodgers made a lot of great music, but after Rodgers left the band they got stuck in making average or even below average albums. Maybe it was due to the music climate at the time...Maybe it had something to to with singer Brian Howe... But on this one Bad Company seem to have found their roots again. Thankfully we don't have to listen to Howe's more or less annoying voice, since the band have recruited a much better singer in the name of Robert Hart.""Company of strangers"" is at least worth 4 stars, very close to 5. It will not have any real impact in the shape of radio play but for us who love the more traditional blues based hard rock it's a treat. You get good groove with great melody from a talented band with a very good singer. The material is very strong!!"
2,"Nice as a scoop, but not useful as a trowel","I ordered this tool because so many of the reviewers said that it was a good substitute for many other tools, including a trowel. I found that it is too curved to be able to dig into anything but the most friable of soils. I have highly amended clay soil, so it's not terribly tough to dig into. I tried digging small holes, just big enough for small annuals and I found it far inferior to a traditional trowel, in fact, not at all up to the job. I will keep using it for making furrows and scooping, but I'll go back to my FAR less expensive, but solid and trusty trowel for small digging jobs."
4,"Fabulously entertaining, yet a little unrealistic","As a fan of Love Stories, I look forward to each book. This one is a little different than those standard ones. It's great, and romantic, but it just isn't real life. I can understand how it is that Sara becomes obssessed with Josh, to the point of lying and claming her friend Tim is her boyfriend. Of course, we all know the ending... Sara and Tim live happily ever after. It's getting there that's the problem. After Sara basically lies her way through life and uses Tim's friendship to her advantage, Tim has to have a bashed ego. But when Sara says that she loves him, all is forgotten and they hug and kiss and yadda, yadda, yadda. Had it been a little more realistic, don't you think Tim's anger should have lasted more than one page? Other than that, the book is great. Kudos to the author! :)"
3,A bit small,The precision of the reel mower is good. The 33 is too small for a large yard. It is light and tends to float on thick grass. This makes it difficult to mow a straight line. Good power sourse.
4,Interesting,"Chapters flows very quickly, and the authors gives you the basics to understand concepts behind the scenes.Obviously it's a prerequisite to know Java as well as a CGI and Web Administration notions. Interesting and clear explanation."
3,For fans only,this early work is poor when compared to her later efforts. Only someone who needs her entire ouvre should spend their money on this mediocrity.
4,Great game!!!,"This is a great game and my students love it, but feels it is not current enough. I play it with my students before a holiday weekend. The only problem is that I know all the tv shows, but I am 30 years old and have seen most of the shows. So if you are playing with kids or teens, expect them not to know everything."
3,mandy barnett,would have loved to have jacket cover of the cd and a hard case but besides that cd itself was great
4,Interesting...unique...pretty good,"Now I'll admit it, I didn't buy this CD to long ago. Even though this was made back in 1995 I decided why not, I loved the song ""In The Meantime"" back then and had planned on buying the album, but I always forgot about it when I was in the record store. But anyways lets get down to the CD, Spacehog definetly intended to make their album unique and different from anyone else's and let me tell you they sucessfully did it. The only other sound I can really compare this to is David Bowie and even saying that is a stretch, and though this album could of been better I still applaud them for their bold efforts. ""In The Meantime"" is a great song though, and if they only followed that formula for the rest of ""Resident Alien"" it would be a classic. Yes it is true, these guys deserve alot more recognition than they get, hopefully someday they will finally get that fame that seems to be owed to them."
2,this one is lousy,"I love Jimmie Dale Gilmore. I love ""Spinning around the Sun"" and ""Jimmie Dale Gilmore"" and ""One Endless Night"" but this cd is lousy. My friends make fun of his voice and I always defend him but on this cd he really sings goofy. When he sings ""round and round and round and round"" or ""we'll fly, and fly, and fly, and fly"" I can't keep a straight face. I couldn't give it 1 star because that is reserved for lousy pop music or pop country music. I highly recommend his new record ""One Endless Night""."
1,Not reliable,"EVERY time I stand on this scale, it gives a different reading. Today I'm looking for a new scale. I do NOT recommend this scale if you really want to know how much you weigh. It can be off by up to 5 lbs!"
1,Died soon after purchase.,"Died soon after purchase. Thought it was the battery. Went to replace it, and nothing.$30 item. Is it worth my time an energy to chase down the mfgr for a warranty?Nope. Just time and money wasted. I will just buy another scale and hope it works. That's the unfortunately consumer experience, these days."
4,Works well!,This is a nice size scale. I am a weight watcher member and when I weigh myself before meeting and get weighed at the meeting the weight has been within 2/10's of a lb accurate. It was a good buy!
1,Disappointed,"I thought this little ""precision"" electronic scales would fit my needs perfectly.Imagine my disappointment in finding it to be VERY inaccurate, varying upto four pounds when weighing within a 10 minute period. I returned theproduct and will search for another - one that is truly ""precision"". I guesswhat surprised me was that WW had actually put their name on this one!"
3,Butler's glassware,The glassware I received was not the same clarity as what I have bought in department stores-it was also thicker than the department store glassware
2,Edison's apologia,"This book is very well written, illustrated and produced; also it is a very good introduction on Edison's contribution to motion pictures but, while it doesn't seem to falsify the actual truth, the author, Charles Musser one of the major historians of early cinema development, bends backwards to exonerate Edison's less than savory practices; to present Edison as the ""inventor of motion pictures""; to claim the development of cinema for the US; and to make totally unsupported claims that this was a beneficial turn of events for all cinema / motion pictures!"
3,Great product while it lasts,"This is a great head set while it lasts, I buy lots of them and some have only lasted as little as a few weeks. I don't feel that it's too heavy or doesn't fit well like some people say but it needs to be built better to last longer! I could never imagine not having it as I am very busy while I am on the phone so both hands are free."
2,The edge of light.,I had a very difficult time keeping the characters straight and so I stopped reading it. I will try again some day.
2,Never really know,"Although you can spend your life along side someone, as I did growing up with all involved, you may never really know what they think, how they hurt or what minute circumstance will forever change their lives. This book barely covers the reality of being a teen in So. Pas. Bing could have delved deeper into the case and she would have uncovered things more important than how much money Kathy's parents had or how poor David was. I saw Danae the night before she died. She worked in the same mall as I and I happend to look up from my station and saw her walk by. I didn't call out to say Goodbye or anything. I, as all I am sure, thought there would be a tomorrow. Although I am glad this book was written, I am still sad that it was written about my friends and people I knew. It's been 15 years now, and I still remember it as yesterday."
4,Almost perfect action film,"Some reviewers on imdb trashed this film, but I absolutely love it. It's sexy without being pornographic, and it moves along at just the right pace; just slow enough so you can tell what's going on; but something is always going on! There are definite lesbian overtones, although all the sex is heterosexual. Andrea Osvart is fantastic. Selena Khoo, not so good; her physical acting is great, but her dialog is B movie stilted. I found the plot original and interesting. I also really like the soundtrack.I think an ""A"" production would have had a better actor than Khoo, or maybe reshot to get her scenes right. Overall, though, I liked it better than many full scale productions such has ""Crouching Tiger..."" and the new disaster of similar plot with Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, ""Wanted"".I recommend this film for fans of action, soft porn, and of ""relationship"" movies."
4,Fun action flick,"High profile assassin, Gilda, embarks on a journey with unlikely suspect Lin, a high class Chinese call girl. The bond between the 2 friends solidifies as they confront compromising and jeopardous situations. Their friendship gives them strength to stare death and deceit in the face as they risk having it all or losing it all in their femme fatale mission of vengeance.This movie has lots of action, seduction and deceit. The 2 girls are both involved in a plot that puts them in a dangerous situation. Their enemy is close by and they are just 1 wrong move from being found out. I was really impressed by the fight scenes and Andrea Osvart's sexiness. The other chick is pretty average looking, but she's tough and kicks major butt. This movie is a typical femme fatale flick, but if you like that type of movie, this one will entertain you. I honestly don't think this movie is worth buying, I recommend just renting it."
5,Perfect,Perfect replacement for my remote that got crushedin the tailgate. Works just as good as the original. Price good too.
1,Dont buy from eek Technology,"you can find a better price , and its only replacement remote starter, it took them 3 weeks to send the item"
2,Short on Battery Life,"If you happen to buy this remote, be sure to also buy a good supply of AAA batteries as they don't last much longer than a few weeks with this unit. At least for me, this is how it's been."
3,Great picture but a bit too dark.,"I narrowed down my search to this Panasonic and the Toshiba 27AF61. I chose the Panasonic because I found an excellent deal at a local merchant which made the price ... less than the Toshiba. I only have one major gripe about this tv in particular; the picture is significantly darker than the Toshiba. It's usually not a problem, but when you're watching a dimly lit scene, you lose a lot of the detail in the shadows. You can [turn] up the brightness to compensate, but then you get blacks that are grey. If you're going to spend the extra on a flat tv, it's most likely because you care about the picture. If that's the case, keep this review in mind and go for the Toshiba."
5,Buy this if you want some REAL music.,"One of the best albums I own. Maybe THE BEST! An essential lesson in Doom/Stoner metal. Sounds like it was influenced by Ozzy-era Black Sabbath and Trouble. The sum of the parts (Pepper Keenan, Phil Anselmo) is greater than their previous bands (C.O.C, Pantera). Super Heavy, but bluesy and melodic. Even the lighter songs (Stone the Crow) are heavy, and the other trippy stuff (Jail) is great too. Will not dissapoint."
4,"Great album, metal fans shouldn't pass this up.","I wouldn't call this a Metal album, even though Down contains some of the hardest musicians out, Nola is a whole other vibe. This belongs in everyones collection for its sheer power and grace."
5,classic,"i bought this cd when i was 12 cause i was and still am a huge pantera fan(favorite band). at 12 years old i liked it but it didnt have that groove of pantera. but now at 23, i fully understand it. and now days out of over 600 cds, down is one of the most played bands in rotation. every song is damn amazing. down 2 and down 3 are equally amazing in their own right. there is just something about the man phil anselmo and his vocals. when i think of heavy metal i think of phil anselmo. if you love black sabbath, pantera, or just metal in general i would highly suggest you pick this monster of an album up, along with their other 2. if you dont dig down then you really dont like metal.later"
5,Unreal - seriously one of the fing best,The plain black cover gives no hint to how purely cool and hard this album really is. This fuggin album is very perfection in every way. Do not hesitate to buy one for each disk player you own.The drumming is so damn sweet and I'm completely blown away everytime I turn this on. Guitar work is completely awe inspiring. The sound of Nola is perfection in my feeble little mind.I'm going to revise my other ratings to remove a star to pay homage to this album.
4,Awesome Case,"I use this case to carry around my Panasonic HMC150 - fits the camera, light, mic setup and spare batts with room to spare!"
5,Next best thing to being there,I purchased this CD after a concert by the African Children's Choir. It is a wonderful sampling of their music and energy. Familiar Christian songs with an African flair...and the devotion of children.
1,disappointing,"I have in the past eagerly bought books from the Visual Quickstart Guide series, but this one is a terrible disappointment. It has all the weaknesses of the series (such as tiny font in the screen snapshots), and none of the strength.The great strength of the series was the profuse use of screen snapshots with callbacks. This is absent here. The graphics are minimal, and the text sometimes refers to an unspecified picture ten pages earlier or to no picture at all that i can discover.My adivice is just to forget about this book."
5,headset for cell phone,"I have MS and this headset is perfect for me, I can't use right hand, so just putting this over my head is very easy. I don't have to worry about those little ear pieces falling out. So thank you for this wonderful product."
2,What?!,"I've tried many different headsets and either I can't hear them, or they can't hear me. In this case, they couldn't hear me.I finally broke down and splurged on a whole Plantronics Calisto wireless system with bluetooth headset. It cost me $250, but I'm finally happy! I can easily hear most calls on just the lowest volume setting, everyone says I sound clear. If someone is especially quiet, I can turn it up and hear no problem now. The whole thing is completely wireless to boot. If this is for business, just get the good stuff. You'll be happier in the long run."
4,headset,"The product is fine, the guy I bought it from is a thief. I ordered and PAID for two pieces. He sent only one piece, essentially charging me double. I wrote to amazon, but they won't do anything. DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS GUY."
5,Golden Voice,"I am a avid music fan with a collection of 1000's os songs over the past 50 years. Bill Anderson is one of the greats. A golden voice with songs you keep with you for a life time. Such song as "" Still "" Po Folks"" this cd has many of his greatest. Thank you Bill Anderson for making life alittle better and the good times so much easier to remember. To all our troops be safe and all our vets welcome home ."
3,Bill Anderson,I was a little disappointed in the cd. It wasn't his best work. I wouldn't buy it again or advise anyone else to buy it.
3,meh hope it lasts,"first this is not for aesthetics it will be FLAT black I.E. dull a military finish.the point of it seems to be to kill glare and light refraction/reflection.it is not easy and requires a steady hand and good eyes to make a solid coat.pretty much just a black pain pen, I just hope the stuff is durable as that was what I need.also takes a bit to ""pump"" the pain so it will function, briefly referred in directions.I have used the bluing version and it works very differently, stuff is also incredibly fumey indoors.I did my whole exposed 10/22 barrel and receiver with plenty of paint to spare.all in all a decent value for the purpose if it is durable will update."
3,Works well on minor scratches with a little FastWax,"I used this product on my Trek Soho road bike. My bike has a flat black finish, so I thought this pen would be perfect for some of the scratches on the finish. The pen by itself wasn't enough. In fact, it looked worse after I did the initial touchup because the pen's black was an obviously different shade from my bike's black finish. But at the advice of my friend, I applied a product called FastWax to smooth everything out... and that did the trick! The visibility of the scratches were minimized. It's not perfect, but it's definitely a big improvement. The pen did a good job in ""re-coloring"" the scratches with black, and the wax brought it all together so that it wasn't two different shades anymore. I give this product three stars because, by itself, it wasn't enough to do the job; however, it was still in an integral part of it. When used in conjunction with the wax, it worked well for me."
2,Useless,This is not a permanent solution by any means. It wears away very quickly and if you use any cleaning solvents it simply wipes right off. Not what I expected.
4,Excellent for minor touch ups,"A convenient means of covering small mars on a black rifle.The coating is easily applied from this ""magic marker""but easily wears off with normal handling."
1,Bug and Raunch,"This CD is perhaps the single most catastrophic thing to happen to country music since Rascal Flatts began to inflict their ""art"" on the world. What an amazing collection of half-baked, cheesy, overwrought, insincere wailings this is! The whole ""Kid Rockitizing"" of country music is a profoundly disturbing trend. Few things are more pitiful than a couple of over the hill rednecks who morph into hip hop wannabes. The ""skip"" button on your CD player will get a real workout here. The one and only bright spot is ""Holy Water,"" which is a huge surprise...sensitive and authentic and beautifully performed. Apart from that one song, zero stars for this CD."
1,This CD has it all,"My first introduction to Big & Rich came during the halftime show of the NBA All-Star Game broadcast. Their performance was like a lightening rod. They truly have all it takes to be the next great band of all time. People don't know this, but Kid Rock stole the whole ""little person on stage"" bit from them, and incorporating rap and beats with guitars and country is so confusing.Since buying their CD I've started experimenting with more hardcore Rap acts like M & M, and Ludicrous. And Nelly recorded that song with Toby Keith, and I like that too. And now Willie Nelson has done a reggae record. But this is where it all started. If we can all just get along, and combine a whole bunch of different stuff into each song, like banjoes and dj-scratching and trombones, the music will gradually become less confusing. And everyone can enjoy it."
2,Not so good,"I thought I would like this CD - country music with a twist - since I like many forms of music. It is well produced. Some of the songs are real catchy. The problem is two-fold. 1) After a while, it starts to seem kinda gimmicky. Tongue in cheek only goes so far for so long. 2) Big & Rich do not have the best voices in country music. They hit the mark on songs like Big Time and Holy Water, but miss terribly on many others. Music is all about personal taste, and personnaly, it is only a decent cd."
4,Way better than I thought,"When I heard ""Save a Horse""...I thought what is this?? Not country. A friend of mine recommended I listen to the whole CD before I made judgement on B&R. How right she was. The CD is great. I love Holy Water"" and ""Big Time"". I think it's great that they have opened up new doors and are helping country music evolve."
3,Good points and not so good points,"I found this video very informative. However, the corrections done using the choke chains are misleading. She only uses large dogs with lots of fur. No where in the video does she suggest how to properly use a choke chain on small breed dogs. Judging by the way the ""pop-and-release"" method was used on these large dogs, serious damage would be done to a small breed dog. Other lessons, however, not using the choke chain were a good source of information. I will definitely use this video as a refresher of how to train."
3,Not A Good Match of Author and Subject,"The problem is that Norman Spinrad doesn't really believe in magic, and he's writing about characters who did. So he can't enter fully into the world of Vercingetorix. He deals well with the military aspect. I appreciated the clever generalship of both Vercingetorix and Caesar. But Spinrad sees Druid magic as symbolic, not real. This perspective would have been alien to Vercingetorix and the other Gallic Druids that he attempts to portray."
2,"It's MARINE, not marine....","Not only was this story, which had great, great potential, very boring, I cringed every time I saw the word ""marine."" No Marine is identified in this manner, and as the wife of a former Marine, I was a little offended. That said, Tori and Rocket made a handsome couple, but like most S.A. books, this story was a boring tale mixed with a few delightful highlights."
2,Fizzled fast,"Tori and Rocket were interesting, as was Jared, but there were so many dull spots in this book I nearly put it aside. In fact, this is true of many Susan Andersen books. I wish she'd write at least one consistent page turner."
3,Purchased As A Gift,"I purchased this as a gift to my young teenage daughter. She devoured the book in a day. She said it was ok, but still worth purchasing.For me the best part is that my daughter is reading instead of being online or out causing problems. So for me this was good.Ron FenneyHuntington Beach, CA"
2,Not my favorite by this author,"2.5 stars.Bor-ing. While I might have loved this book years ago, I now find myself mostly annoyed (okay... very annoyed) with it. And bored with the constant derailments and senseless rambling. What speaks volumes though is the fact that I bought and read this book when it first came out and, for the life of me, I didn't remember anything about it, not even why I loved it enough to put on my keeper shelf to begin with. And I remember all the good books I've read prior to this one... So it's not a very memorable read either. Oh well, more space on my keeper shelf since this book is destined for the donation bin."
2,What?,"Apparently lots of people watched a different DVD than we did. We like to rent gay films to be supportive of gays in the industry, but this was a mistake. First, there is no script. Second, almost all of the movie is done in close-up when panning back/out would have helped to visually set the context in many of the scenes. Third, what little script there was is not always delivered with the best acting. Fourth, one can only watch an actor sitting or lying around ""pensive"" for so long...at some point you expect an actual story."
4,A Good Movie,"Well, I can tell you a few things about Swedish culture. It depends on which era you're talking about. Right now we're dealing with the welfare state, 1950 to now. There's a law that says you have to be royalty to live there. Everyone's on welfare, and it's a government jobs or the military. The government jobs pay less than welfare but has more benefits like paid vacation and incentives. The government owns everything. Most educated people spoke English, but they get taught English in school. They are a neutral country, and during WWII they either hid in the mountains or they joined them."
2,NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,"I was wanting the soundtrack of the songs by the original artists that were played throughout the movie in the background of several scenes. The instrumental is good but not what I was wanting...Otis Redding, Etta James, etc."
1,DO NOT BUY Panasonic DLP TV,"I bought Panasonic PT52DL on October 10, 2003. It worked fine for a while then all of sudden, on January 10, 2004, there was no picture. I called the company and they directed me to a local facility. They came and picked up the TV. First they told me the light bulb was out and it was backordered. After three weeks they got the light bulb and now they are telling me it is not the bulb, it is some other part that is still backordered. As of March 2, 2004 they have no idea when they will get my TV fixed. DO NOT BUY till Panasonic has fixed its problems with service."
2,Another worthless book...,I agree its useless; just like so many IBS books. There a million of IBS books out there everyone with their opinion on how to treat IBS. I bought this book and Eating for IBS. I followed the suggestions and got no relief. They are now recycled paper.
4,great gift for architecture buff,I bought this for my dad who's building a prarie-style home and is the biggest FLW fan I've ever met. He loved it and said that he'd never seen anything like it. He's planning a future business trip around seeing some of the houses listed in this guide. I was surprised at what a hit it was.
1,It's Great When It works...,"I bought this television in the summer of 2002. It is now February of 2003, and the television won't turn on. No strange happenings to lead up to it, it just won't turn on. The warranty is for 1 year parts, 90 days labor. New televisions are being made to break."
1,No Warranty!!,"Panasonic warranties stink. Do you know the warranty information? Well, if it is 1 year, what is that for? Parts? Labor? None?I currently own several Panasonic TV's and TV/VCR Combo's and they have been for the most part trouble free. In September 2001 I bought a 27"" flat screen TV from Panasonic and it has been nothing but trouble as of April 2002. The major problem has been with support. Yes, I own a good deal of A/V gear including some Pro A/V gear, but the support problem has been with the warranty periods offered by Panasonic on large heavy screen TV's. Don't be fooled by the warranty you see here or at a retail store. The labor is only for 90 days, and they'll charge you big time for labor.Almost everything I have from Panasonic has been trouble-free, but if you do have a problem, be prepared to throw away and re-purchase because it would cost less than the labor charges."
3,A real disappointment,"It seems like the Lonely Planet travel books are really hit and miss. Some are really great while others, like this Budapest guide, seem like little work was put into them. The sections titled Facts About Budapest, Places to Stay, Places to Eat, and Entertainment are pretty good (though still not as detailed as they might be), but I was disappointed with what I consider the most important section, Things to See and Do. For a city as big as Budapest it seemed like scant few pages were devoted to this subject. I also wish more photos were included, because it's hard to know whether something is worth going to see if you have no idea what it looks like beforehand."
3,Questionable Investment,"This book has good general resources for the Metro, and general services, but I found the descriptions of sites to see a bit lacking. The placement of the maps next to the corresponding sites of interest or sections of the cities would have made touring much easier. Flipping to the back constantly was nerving. Also, I found the walking tours hard to follow, and would have preferred some pictures as a reference (descriptions of sites are lacking). If you are a visual person like I am this book is not for you."
3,Good while it lasted......,"This TV was great while it lasted. Unfortunately it didn't last long. I had this TV for only 2 years before it died on me. It seems as though the more expensive TVs last less time than the cheaper older televsions. I have a 27"" sanyo TV that has lasted me over 5 years and it was only $150.Oh well...it isn't worth the $300 it will cost to fix it, so I am going to buy another 27"" TV for $225."
3,ER C535 video cam bat,"These bats need to be ""charge conditioned"" , meaning that you have to charge and partial discharge 3-4 times to get a full charge. They have probably been setting a long time. After full operation is achieved bats are just like those that came with the camcorder."
2,Doesn't fit Panasonic HDC-SD9,"The description says this battery fits Panasonic Camcorders, but it doesn't fit my Panasonic HDC-SD9. This turned out to be waste of money for me because the description wasn't accurate."
3,Caution: Requires ALOT of Patience,"Before you buy this game make sure you have the patience for it.I bought this game looking for a more arcade like combat sim. I had recently bought F/A-18 and couldn't even begin to play it due to the complexity of the controls. This is NOT much better.Graphics: They are top of the line. The game is a visual delight for a flight sim, and that's where the 3rd star in my rating came from. (running it on a Geforce 3 Ti Series card)Sound: Awesome. Great sound effects with the Audigy Gamer x card.Game play: WAY too complicated for a game like this. It could have been one of the greatest arcade flight games ever made, but if you don't have the patience to learn to fly, bomb, and dogfight, for hours on end, don't bother.I reccomend Comanche 4 by novalogic if your looking for some arcade fun. Two button controls, and the same awesome graphics."
4,Not your typical Erasure cd!,"Listen carefully. At first you might consider this one to be too artsy, but it has great songs. The catch is that they are all 6 minutes-plus long and may be hard to listen too at first. However, this is erasure at their best and Andy sounds increadible. Not radio friendly, but does everything have to be?"
3,Erasure tries to get arty,"""Erasure"" was Vince and Andy's attempt at making an atmospheric record. I remember someone at the time calling this a gay version of Pink Floyd, with Vince trying to go for the ethereal. Unfortunately, when your forte is snappy 3 minute pop songs, bringing in Diamanda Galas to wail overtop the instrumentals in more annoying than it is art. The end result was this stumble by the heretofore dependable Erasure.The problem lays mostly in the songs. Only ""Rescue Me"" measures up to the snap of past hits, and ""Fingers and Thumbs"" comes close. ""Rock Me Gently"" is the most successful in the art vs commerce experiment, but gets bogged down in the overlong arrangement. You certainly can't blame them for trying to evolve out of their box, but for a band that has a CD in my desert island box (""Wild!""), I can reliably say that ""Erasure"" is a CD that you can pass on if you're just discovering Vince and Andy's fine body of work.[...]"
5,awesome book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I highly recomend this book to anyone! I love the vegie burger recipe! This book has many good recipes from all different cultures and a helpful source of mail order tvp. Great buy!
5,Amazon Real Find,I found a copy of this book in a home I visited in Ontario. I was cautious about trying it; I thought it sounded a little granola to me.However this is just the challenge for an old time cook such as myself; over 50ish. This is a real keeper. Anna Read
5,A gift from the Gods,this album is amazing in so many ways I can't even begin to list. My advice to you is this...do yourself a favor...pick this cd up and be blessed with what is as close to a masterpiece as it gets!
1,Emmylou Harris - Wrecking Ball CD,The songs on the CD Wrecking Ball by Emmylou Harris are completely unintelligble and a useless product. Every one should be waary about purchasing this CD.Wrecking Ball
5,Sweet Old World - one of the great moments,"I'd had Wrecking Ball stuck away in a back corner because on a first listen it wasn't the Emmylou Harris I knew. Then, a spare moment of time to REALLY listen, and wow.There's a slice of pure perfection it this albumYou travel a long way to hear anything more sensitively performed, better produced, or perfect for the the artist than Wrecking Ball's Sweet Old World.At its basics its a regretful song about the sweet things some person who has suicided has left behind in this Sweet Old World.Then you're listening again to the words, and you realize the almost woozy, sliding ethereal sound that's been created to wrap around the song is so acutely suggestive of some soul slipping gently away from life. Huge marks for Emmylou herself, Daniel Lanois who produced it, and Neil Young who's background vocal is right on itIt's a wonderful moment in music.."
5,...without exaggerating..,"...everyone in the world, if all were good and holy, would own a copy of this beautiful record."
3,Spartan Costume,It was a cute and comfortable costume except it was much thinner than what I expected.
4,It's On the Border of Ok/Good- 3.5 stars,"First, let me say that I've read all of her books. I was looking forward to this book for a long time as it's the start of the Spice Trilogy. It starts of well introducing us to Georgie who in the beginning I really loved and her hero Ian in India. It starts of well and somewhere along the middle it gets kind of lost when the characters go to London but did find itself towards the end with a wonderful ending.However, I have to say that it wasn't as great as her previous books and I felt like I wanted a lot more in the relationship and development but that said I read the book in a day and am looking forward to the upcoming two books that will complete the trilogy."
4,Gealen Foley,"The best book in the spice trilogy, it is also the first book. DO NOT READ THE OTHERS!!!"
3,Something missing....,"Have got every one of GF's books, and was so excited about receiving HOD. Sadly, I found it lacking.There wasn't all that much romance compared to her previous books, and I found myself skimming some of the pages as they were boring.Will buy the second book in the Spice trilogy, and hope that it is an improvement on the first.I hope GF doesn't follow Johanna Lindsey's path of losing the flow through a couple of books before returning to her former writing style in latter novels."
1,bad one,"The setting is good but other than that nothing really caught my attention. The character of the leader heroine seems so be misplaced in the period. The hero was in ""vacation"" in Ceylon (slightly short of the Caribbean).The author took an American girl (she practices Yoga) and oddly placed it in 1800 India. I never felt so stupid reading a romance, usually I enjoy myself. I'll definitely ""skip"" this author."
4,great buy,I BOUGHT THIS GAME FOR MY SON. HE LOVES IT. THE BOARD IS ROOMY AND THE PIECES ARE STURDY. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
1,less than one,It was awful it looked as if it was photo copied. Some pages where totally black and could not read. Total crap!!!!!!
5,super heros conquer,I bought these caps for three students to use for a marching band iniation. They were perfect. The kids had a lot of fun and the caps added a nice touch to their villian costumes!
5,An absolute must,"This, the newest album from TMBG, serves as both a testament to their intelligence and evolving style. Whether you feel like taking the time to appreciate the various elements of satire (particularly of consumerism and advertising), or just want to sing and dance along, Factory Showroom is absolutely perfect. Personal Favorite: ""I Can Hear You"", a song recorded without electricity, the lyrics of which are recognizable as trademarks of todays overwhelming technology (a heaping helping of sly irony)..."
4,and i wont be till my head falls off,"I'm not a kid... this is just easier.I have no idea why the critics savage this album like a rabid pitbull on a bloody five year old. While not thier best work this cd has some great tunes... metal detector, new york, till my head falls off, and and spiraling shape are all winners. anyways. just thought i'd say. Its a good album. not nearly the nerd rock travesty the critics will have you belive."
2,"Disappointing, and demonstrable of a loss of creativity...","This is the only TMBG album that I don't eulogize. Musically, and lyrically, it lacks the humor, creativity, and intelligence that epitomizes all other TMBG works. This is NOT the CD to buy, if you're interested in who TMBG are and what they're made of, and what they typify. Nothing about this album is in any way reminiscent of who they are. I listened to this CD a couple times then ripped it to shreds. Maybe TMBG has lost their ingenuity..."
1,Shame on Magnavox,Do not buy this product! It has been nothing but problems until it completely died after 6 months.
3,One of the Last Recordings,"There's not much to say about this recording except that it was one of the last ones made by Sweets Edison before his death in July of 1999. As one might expect, the playing is weak compared to what it once was, but don't buy this CD to hear Sweets (or Clark Terry for that matter) at his peak. Buy it to hear the soulful expressions of some of the masters as they tell their last stories drawing from over 60 years of experience each. It also offers some playful commentary by Sweets as he introduces numbers and band members. He was ""sweet"" right up to the end. Recommended only if you're a die hard Sweets or Terry fan, otheriwse check these guys out in their prime (1940's and 50's)."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book since it does not encompass all types of families. I have a wonderful relationshp with my sister, plus I have a friend who has 3 wives. What about them?"
1,GARBAGE,"This book is quite simply the attempt to stamp approval on homosexual marriage. It doesn't belong in schools and if you receive it home, you need to challenge your school district and school board. It is a family's right to determine the moral teachings to your child. Our schools fail miserably at Math and Science and Writing.. they need to put effort on that, and leave the moral upbringing to parents. If you are a parent and decide it is a book for you, that is your right, too. But, it does not belong in school, being forced down the throats of our 5, 6, and 7year olds. Period."
1,not good,the order took more than a week longer than projected and the weatherstip does not have the proper backing on it to be able to use it.
5,Looks Like Silver,This disposable flatware is the best. I even got comments on how nice it is. Very nice! I will order more of this product.
5,Great for Party,Used these for a 50th brithday party and the worked great! Didn't have an issue with any breaking and people loved how they looked!
4,Pretty but just wish they were a bit larger,This flatware looks great on the table I just wish they were a bit larger; especially for us with larger hands.
4,Not compatible with nokia 6600 as it says,Ok.. i bought this recently and to my surprise its not compatible with nokia 6600..thats my phone. So i did a little research and found the product manual online ( i have submitted it to amazon..so should appear sometime). I believe the Plantronics people have messed up and have classified MX303-N3 as the one compatible with 6600 while its MX303-N1. Have a look at the manual and you will know.
3,Don't Bother,"It's not bad when it works. I have had the 500 series now for just over 1 year. It broke the first time half way through the warrentee and the second right after it ran out. With only an MMC slot the expandibility stinks as well. On the plus side, the screen is very bright and nice, battery life was good, and the price is now almost half what I originally paid."
3,Lorraine Sinkler to the Rescue,"Lorraine Sinkler was a superb writer-editor who I believe had as much or more to do with Goldsmith's books as the author himself. She touched gingerly on his tendency toward irritability, which was interesting. I spent a lifetime reading and re-reading Goldsmith's work, but for many reasons I am no longer a disciple, one reason being that there is too much Masonry (the men's club) in his thinking and writing. But I recommend you give him a try, because the writing is way above average for an esoteric subject like his."
5,Great Book,"It was a fantastic, BUT it's the EXACT same book word for word as ""Why Trust The Bible?"" by Amy Orr-Ewing but with a different title!?"
4,6 month old loved it,"My son got this as a Christmas gift from his Nana. He loved it immediately. It was the only toy he played with for a while. He doesn't move the little animals around on the prongs much, but he LOVES spinning that wheel to play the music. I love the cause and effect attribute of this toy. He is 1 today and still plays with it."
2,Go for the product slicks,"I was hoping to get a solid 10,000-feet view of IBM's Java product lineup but what I found instead was one man/company's justification for betting the farm on IBM Java tools. This isn't to say IBM's tools aren't worth it, but I didn't want to have to wade through all the filler aimed at future readers interested in why WNS Inc. decided to go this route. There is good information here, but it could have been done in a more efficient manner. An IBM sales rep and his product slicks will save you themoney and you'll learn almost as much."
2,Out of date and too general,This volume focuses mostly on VAJ version 2. It also tries to cover far too much material without going into detail... which is useless for developers.
4,umm....good album,"this album has within a day found a spot in my stereo rotation. better than the first, although i think blindfolded is still my favorite song. 2 great tunes: shoulder to the wheel and the vast spoils of america. order it or go to your local record spot and pick it up. its worth the 12 bucks people. go see them live too. thats worth the ticket (even though i only saw them accidentally along with dillinger escape plan, kid dynamite, and snapcase). later all."
2,Not as good as Stay What You Are,"Alright, here goes: My friend first introduced me to Saves the Day when he told me how sweet Stay What You Are was. I bought the CD and it has been in my cd player ever since. I never get bored of the CD and all of the songs are great.Well, this CD is completely different. To me, it sounded like a completely different band. All of the songs sound exactly the same and, honestly, they don't have that something that makes me love a song or album. I dont know what the other STD albums sound like, but if they all sound like Through Being Cool, I don't think I'll be giving them a listen."
5,"Fun, Solid, and Accurate","This is a very well made toy; it is not at all fragile, but is very realistic looking, making it the perfect toy for dinosaur-loving children. This Kronosaurus was one I have been wanting to get for quite some time, and I am very pleased with my purchase."
5,Super creativity book,GET THIS BOOK. It is simply terrific. I nearly finished3 chapters and the moodling technique is stellar. Five starsis way too low a rating for this book. I can't wait 'tillI see how the rest of the book will go.This book is worth every penny.
3,It was OK,"I took a class on this book at a local church. Didn't agree with everything in it, but then I took the class to make friendships and that part worked out great."
5,Excellent Biography,"Paris has done a great job in shedding light on the reclusive Garbo. It probes into her life, but is not needlessly intrusive. Endlessly fascinating."
4,Wonderful!,"This is by far a wonderful CD. I have listened to it over and over again! If you like Reggae, you will enjoy this wonderful Chrisitan Reggae CD."
2,Partly cloudy,"2 1/2By now you should know if you like or dislike the technically accentuated prog-metal show-offs, and appreciation of this fan-intensive EP will certainly be determined by that relation, as there is simply not enough challenging material here to exceed typical early/mid-career appeasement."
2,Ugh.....please stay original,"I think it's funny how some of the fans here love this album the most out of Dream Theaters entire collection. Probably due to the fact that a lot of it isn't even their material.Stick to writing your own material DT, covering songs has never been very cool except for a few good instances."
5,A truly fantastic compilation!,"I can sum up this album in one word: WOW! I would gladly have paid the price I did only for the opening track, but if that wasn't enough, DT had to go and cover some great songs. But let's start at the beginning. A Change of Seasons is just amazing. It takes you through time changes, mood swings and every jam you've come to expect from DT. But, for me, the highlight of this album is about 1 minute long, on Funeral For A Friend. The guitar solo towards the beginning (about 2 minutes in, I think) is outstanding. It just tears into your soul, you can almost feel the angst of EJ when he wrote this song. The rest of the songs rock too, especially the last two, where they cover Zeppelin and a host of other bands, including Kansas, Queen, Journey, Floyd, Genesis and the Dixie Dregs. But that guitar solo... wow...."
5,The best of Steve's (great) catalog,"This record is the best of Steve's work, Bar none. All of his discs are brilliant (...well ""Northern Song"" is a little boring...), but this record amalgamates all of his previous work into the ultimate synthesis. Raging feedback, surging percussion, delicate kalimba, plaintive vocals, it's ALL here. Get this record!!"
2,Great when it works but a pain when it locks up my MAC,"I bought this hoping it would work out well as a external 24/7 drive enclosure. It does work but after a day or two of spin up's and down's, it locks up my MAC hard. I did narrow it down to this enclosure. I have two different ones connected to my Mini. The other will not lock the machine up. When it locks the machine finder freezes hard and I have to force quit everything and reboot. I only put a WD 500GB drive in it so the power supply should handle the load. The drive only pulls .75A. The power supply it comes with says is rated at 2 amps. I have tried changing energy settings etc. Nothing really fixes the problem. So for a occasional external drive it is OK. But, for a continuous on all the time enclosure it sucks. I am putting this on the shelf as a emergency drive tool and getting something that can take the work load."
4,Worked great; very simple installation,I had a G-Tec enclosure die on me after a couple of years and was able to easily transplant my drive into this enclosure to retrieve (and back up) that data. Works very well!
5,Perfect way to use a smaller 3.5 inch hard drive.,It took longer to unpack the Macally than it did to install the hard drive and get it up and running!I have a iMac and I wanted to use the 500 gig hard drive out of a HP desktop that interacted withsome lightning. (Hot Tip! Electronics and lightning do not play well together!)Now I have an extra 500 gig firewire connected drive to store my photography on!This is a VERY cost effective way to salvage equipment.
1,pros and cons of this enclosure,"Pros: has 3 interfaces which is a great convenience and makes it more interoperable with systems that may have only one of the 3 interfaces available.Cons: 1. Firewire is only 400, which is too slow for today's apps.2. Does not have an 8cm cooling fan on the flat side. Withoutsuch a fan, 7200 rpm drives die within 2 years of operation.I know! I have lost a few already! I will NEVER buy anenclosure without a large fan."
3,"great looking enclosure, but flakey firewire","I bought two of these to go with 2 existing hard drives. I bought them because they match the look of the newer aluminium Macs so well. They fit in perfectly wit this respect (really do look like little Mac Pros), however as with anything silver coloured they don't quite match colour wise. Installation was very easy, no special tools needed, and very simple easy to follow instructions. The multiple interfaces are a nice idea, however I had problems with the firewire staying connected on both of the enclosures I received and with either of the Macs I own. In particular this would happen when the Macs woke from sleep they just would not see the drive untill it was switched of and then back on. I am now useing USB and all is good, just a shame the firewire did not work as expected. The enclosures are a little noisy so if you are looking for a quiet drive enclosure this is probably not for you. All in all pleased with this purchase."
5,Best Bang for the Buck,I have owned probably 20 different types of external hard drive cases and this one is by far the best. I wanted to use a couple of 500gb drives to stream video over my internal network and it had to use FW. Well after much searching I found these and they are the best FW cases out there. The price was great as well. I highly recommend these to anyone who needs great FW connectivity. USB is probably as good as USB can be on these drives and the eSATA works as good as any other eSATA drive I've had. I just wish FW would have won the connectivity war as it is by far superior to USB when you have several drives connected and are xfering large amounts of data.
1,Junk!,"I purchased two different Macally cases in March 2011. Within six months, this case had failed completely and the other case was heating drives so hot that one could cook an egg. They're junk. Don't let the brushed aluminum fool you."
4,Solid casing....great buy for the price,Great casing. Not obtrusive in size and looks great with other apple products near by. Blue LED light looks good and isn't too bright. Excellent casing for $40 - $50.
2,NO FIREWIRE 800!!,"I have several of these enclosures that are dual bay and they are decent. I hate having to screw and unscrew stuff, but they've been reliable enough that I don't find myself needing to swap drives frequently. If you do intend to swap, this is not going to be a great choice.There is no firewire 800! The description above was the same as the dual bay enclosures but they don't specify that it's Firewire 400 and not 800. Since they pulled firewire 400 from the new macs, this is almost useless. I couldn't get it to mount via eSATA but i have not had time to trouble shoot to find out where the problem lies. I just wanted it for FW800.. made a mistake assuming it was exactly the same as the dual bays and it is not but it really needs to be added to the product description1"
1,Drive won't stay mounted,"I couldn't get my drive to work for longer than 10 minutes. I had trouble even getting it to show up on my Mac desktop at first. I thought it was a loose USB cable because it finally showed up after some jiggling and resetting. I started using it and whoops, ten minutes later the drive suddenly disappeared and my Mac scolded me to properly eject it next time.I continued fiddling with the enclosure for another hour before I finally gave up. Thankfully I had another Blacx enclosure to plug my drive into so I could get back to business. This is a brand new 1TB Western Digital SATA drive, by the way, and it works just fine in the other enclosure."
2,MTTF of ~1 year,"I bought two of these, and after about a year, all the interfaces (esata, usb, etc.) on these enclosure started dying off. First went the esata on both enclosures, and now the usb interface doesn't work on either enclosure."
4,improved from the passed Armin Only.,"Its def and great DVD, much larger venue, and well improved in the visuals. Great job from the Armada guys."
4,Armin,"i dig this dvd. its a show like this helps prove he's #1. i haven't seen a live show of his for 4 years, so this is the next best thing.greg"
1,Slapdash presentation of downloaded content - do not buy!,"The Library of Congress ""American Memory"" website has since 1999 included an exhibit called ""Origins of American Animation"" featuring films from 1900-1921. This product is no more than the video files from that website, downloaded and carelessly burned to DVD, with ugly template title cards and slightly misplaced chapter marks. This is a 2 disc set for no clear reason - each disc only runs for 45 minutes. There are many other ways in which the presentation is shoddy and tasteless, but the most damning is the misleading and illegal inclusion of Mickey Mouse on the packaging. [...]"
4,A word about the production...,"The album ""sounds"" incredible. Everything is recorded using tube amps and vintage guitars (I read that even the headphone amps in his studio are tube). The production is concise - no extra drum machines or string programs - but the sound is full and lush.It is refreshing, in this era of ""techno pop"" and MIDI sampling, to hear the faint squeek of fingers moving across guitar strings, and the drawbars moving on the Hammond.Jackson's recording values are as honest as his lyrics."
4,Comprhensive and an easy read,Best all around book about the history of Mooney Aircraft that I have read. Would serve as an excellent pre-buy information source and is an excellent reference book for comparison of different model Mooneys.
5,Magical,"This album is wonderful. My favorite song on it is ""Already Missing You"". Keep up the good work Eddie and Gerald."
5,CD Purchases,I am a big fan of the Levert Family so getting this CD was just great. I don't shop much in Music stores because I never find exactly what I'm looking for. This CD is one I've been looking for quite some time. Great condition and great price.
1,Total B.S.,"Puhleeese!! This guy was a wackjob! Yeah he predicted wars, but there were wars in 1555 too! I can predict right now that there will at least be another war in my lifetime (i'm 25). I'm no psychic. As far as a comet hitting the earth...astronomers say that the odds of that happening are 1 in one million. So...everyone relax. The party ain't over yet!"
1,The end should be coming...,"This book, like all books on Nostradamus, tries very hard to present arguments that supports the case that Nostradamus is an amazing prophet who cannot err. It also preys on the minds of people and makes them believe in horrible things. Never mind the fact that Nostradamus has hundreds of prophecies yet to be fulfilled (or so vague that they won't be) and others that have hundreds of interpretations. Forget the fact that Nostradamus even said that his ""prophecies"" go to sometime the 3000 year range. Let's all be pessimistic and read books that fortell about our coming doom. After all, isn't that all the fun we need in life?"
4,Handy little item,"Just wanted to confirm that this item really is made of 18/10 gauge stainless steel as described. Sometimes Amazon's descriptions do not match what you get, but this does. The weight is substantial, and the item will get your eggs separated for you. At the sale price of $3, with super saver shipping (on orders over $25) this was worth it."
4,would like to purchase or get a copy,"Does anyone have a copy of this available? If so, please let me know, I would love to get a copy."
3,"Does what it claims, but . . .","The connection doesn't always stay seated properly, so it can actually drain the battery, but it does work."
5,Tracy Chapman's best work to date:,"In my humble opinion, this work is Tracy's best, even out performing her 'Telling Stories' CD. I remember when this CD first came out, and several of the cuts received a lot of airplay. I have four of her compilations, but find myself going back to this one almost exclusively. The words will haunt you, with their emotion. The music is a fine compliment to the writing. And, the musicians are all first class. To really get the full meaning of this CD, just put it on the system, volume at a reasonable tone, sit back with eyes closed, and let the music take you away. I do not see how anyone could listen to the whole CD, and not be moved by Tracy's effort here. It is superb!!"
2,Does not live up to original album,"Tracy never gets it going on this album. Chapman created a really good singer-songwriter album in her debut. Here, she just can't live up to that originality and verve. You know what I hear on this cd? I hear an artist who received a large recording contract to make multiple albums, and an artist who forced some output to make this session come together. ""New Beginning""'s got Chapman's voice and melody, but not her inspiration. I suggest trying Catie Curtis--who just keeps growing as an artist; we'll wait for Tracy's next attempt and hope that she regains her fire."
2,Not what I thought!,I went looking for the well-known book that got a good review in Mountain Biking Magazine a while back.. it was called Mountain Biking Moab... but it was by David Crowell.. it has (I found it in Moab!) maps and profiles and such in a carry-along format..This book is a good read.. but buy the other book if you go. It is now called Mountain Biking Moab 2nd Edition Pocket Edition or something like that...I don't know what's going on with this publisher.. This book that I'm reviewing used to be called something else too.. but it looks like the publishers of the good book (the pocket edition) bought this one too... whatever.. but get the pocket edition if you're riding the trails!Keep the Rubberside Down!
4,Awesome Color and B&W Pix!,"After a breif background on the band (except there is NO background on ANY of the drummers!!!)and a little about ""Live Freaky, Die Freaky"", The rest is pretty much an adverisment for the Warped Tour, and the book tells where else they've toured. So the text is a little boring, and you could find 99.9% of the text on the net (hehe... ""Bengay Incident""). But there are a few pages of COLOR photos (you even get a little glimpse of Joels' camo boxers!) and lots of amazing hard-to-find pix of the guys, like Paul playing in front of the White House (by far one of the koolest GC pix I've seen) and the only pic I've I've seen of Billy giving the camera the middle-finger. P.S. Amazon has a great deal! I got it for $13 at the overrated/overpriced, Hot Topic!"
1,Disgusted,"I cannot believe that people like this are even considered a band. My sister bought this book with her allowance a few weeks ago and when I, being a musician myself, saw it, laughed. So I read a page or two and concluded that GC is amoung the worst POP-GROUPS in the world. They are right up there with Linkin Park, Sum-41, Blink 182, Slipknot, Yellow Card, ICP, and the rest of the garbage. Amazon.com should have a negative infinity rating, because that would still be generous when it comes to this ""band"". Terrible."
3,Better than nothing,"While we Spenser fans wait for Warner Bros. to release the regular series on dvd, at least we have these 4 cable movies starring Urich & Brooks to tide us over. It's a shame ABC/Lifetime was unable to get Barbara Stock and Ron McLarty to return as Susan and Belson or actually film these in Boston. I also don't understand why over the course of 4 films they needed 2 different actresses to play Susan(Barbara Williams was the better of the 2). Those quibbles aside, it was great to see Robert Urich as Spenser again. He's definitely better than the doughy Joe Mantegna, who played Spenser in 3 movies for A&E. By the way, there's some brief nudity in the first cable movie Ceremony. That was filmed for foreign release and that scene is included."
4,"Wow! Guinea Pig Series on DVD, finally!","Well, just like everyone else i've seen the [bad] bootlegs that have been around and to think somebody put these movies on DVD in the US is nuts. I guess I'll be getting mine before some government or stay-home mom group decides to ban these blood-soaked gems. I'm glad some decided to put there balls on chopping block for the rest of us. Flower of Flesh and Blood is my personal favorite out of all of Guinea Pigs- the dismemberment is so sick and real looking I had keep telling myself that there fake. I'll be on the lookout for what other titles Unearthed Films is going to be putting out."
1,Nothing interesting....,"Nothing interesting. There are many pieces here but I have only enjoyed ""The magnificent Seven"". As for Mahler's First (included in the disc)...just forget it. It is the worst I have listened to, and I have listen to many...."
1,This guy is a machismo cheesehead,"My friend bought this and already didn't like yoga. This DVD reconfirmed this dislike for her. I borrowed it from her out of curiosity and this guy is really awful. At one point he is pulling hairs off a student and saying, ""ooh you have a lot of hair hun."" It seemed like some kind of 1950's BS of this big man teaching these women how to do yoga because they must have no idea. The women are at times off balance and look like they will fall and of course he doesn't notice. He does upward dog with them which feels horrible and does absolutely not one adaptation for their pregnant bodies. It makes me very angry!! If you are pregnant and in shape just get a Vinyasa yoga video or get a real pregnancy yoga DVD."
5,Smooth Jazzy Guitar with a Strong Blues Influence,I have really enjoyed the direction Chris Rea has gone since overcoming his serious illness. His music has just gotten better each year. This is a very smoothly edited CD and is great to listen to at work when you need to concentrate but still enjoy quality music.I read that his concerts of his blues and jazz material have been very impressive. It is unfortunate that he does not tour the United States.
1,Eric Burdon,"Not what I expected. I thought it would be Eric Burdon singing like he did with the Animals, however he changed it up and I didn't care for it."
5,A Band That Hasn't Lost Their Edge with personnel changes,They're still rockin' after all this time. This band is second only to METALLICA. They should keep on rockin' and put out something new. This CD is a masterpiece.
3,Weakest Anthrax Album.,"Stomp 442 is a bit of a letdown, not that it's bad but too many of the songs sound the same. It doesn't have the same edge as Sound Of White Noise and it sounds a bit flat. The songs are very straightforward and easy to listen to but it will always be my least favorite. Not all of it is bad either, it starts off really strong with Random Acts Of Senseless Violence, Fueled and King Sized but the songs start getting really boring. There's one more good track, American Pompeii and it's one of my favorite Anthrax songs. Stomp 442 is overall just a step above average, not for casual fans."
5,Great,All music was a little out of step in these strange musical times but Anthrax hits with another winner. Soon as you pop this one is you will realize you have bought a great metal album!
4,Good stuff,"I bought the CD just for the song on the radio, wasn't a big fan of bucky on idol though. Really good CD! A lot of the songs sound the same, same tone, same beat, but it is a fun cd to listen to."
5,Wow!,I was sceptical at first cause I really did not like his voice. It soon grew on me and now this has become one of my favorite CDs. Songs like I'll Walk and American Friday Night can make anyone take a second look at Bucky.
4,Bucky Covington's new CD,"I thought this was a very good CD to listen to. I mainly purchased it for his title hit ""A Different World"" but was pleased with many other title songs as well. I would definitely recommend this CD."
4,Shamanism and dream power,"This book relates the author's 30+ years of interaction with guides in the mystical world of the Toltec and Maya and discusses the power of the healing energies that may be applied in healing and transforming the world.A meeting with the writer William Burroughs was the catalyst for a journey to Mexico. Here she was taught by Don Juan Matus, the same shaman that mentored Carlos Castaneda as documented in his best selling books. After the initial apprenticeship with Matus she spent 12 years as a linguist and teacher before returning to the world of Toltec/Maya esotericism after an AIDS diagnosis.Her story makes interesting reading. The epilogue contains a novel view on four different categories of illness, the methods of discerning these and the proper treatments. This is a great book on shamanism, dream power, sorcery and healing that will definitely appeal to fans of the author Castaneda."
3,Let that be the reason you get this book from the library!,I expected so much more out of this book. It had no twist nor turns. I actually started reading this book and put it down and started another. Eventually I finished and I was kind of disappointed. I am hoping that her next book will make up for this.
1,What exactly IS the reason?,"If you are looking for an engaging read, this is not the book for you. All the wrong aspects of the story are drawn out and those that should be discussed in lively detail are rushed along in a paragraph or so. If you like novels that get to the point but do so in an intriguing, suspenseful or worthwhile manner, let Vicky Stringer's novel be the reason you find something else to read."
3,just ok,I could not really get into this book at all. just when it started getting interested the book ended. better luck next time. i was sorry i spent my $15 on it.
3,Independant Woman!!!,"Reading this book definitely wants you to learn more about the character. Her triumph to overcome a broken heart, losing her hair salon & dealing with being a single mother. She somehow gets through it. I salute her!!!Vicki Stringer is an up and coming author...I can't wait to see what else is in stores for her fans and readers. A job well done..."
3,Raw reality,"Shockingly poor writing, but a vivid, exciting story kept me from throwing it across the room. What happened to her editors? What happened to second drafts? A great tale of making it in business by using your head and not your heart; unfortunately, Carmen is undone when she breaks her own rules."
4,I LIKED IT,"I LIKED THE BOOK I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD! IM WAITING ON THE FOLLOW UP, IM CURIOUS TO SEE WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT IN HER LIFE."
1,JUST AWFUL,I have read a lot of Triple Crown books and I've enjoyed most of them so I would have thought that the women that started the company would have been a great writer. WRONG! This book was just long and drawn out way to far. It was just repetitive. Its like when something happens and you have to repeat the story five different times to five different people and you get tired of telling the story. Well I was tired of hearing it. I didn't even finish the book and I hate to start something and not finish it. I just couldn't torture myself any further. Then the author had a never to release a part 2 to the book. OH HELL NO! Saying I was not happy with this book at all is being kind. I absolutely HATED IT!
4,Good cable,"This cable works okay, but note that the brightness of both monitors will be cut in half. This works fine if the brightness is already turned down, but on a dim monitor, it might not work to well."
1,paper Jams,"Unfortunately, the paper kept jamming in this calculator, rendering it all but unusable, which is a shame. I was unable to clear the jam after a while."
5,Caller ID phone at the right price,This was a gift for a friend and he says he likes it. No more getting unwanted calls because he can see the numbers right on the handset.
2,Caller ID?,"WE purchased this phone so we would have a corded phone for when the electricity goes out. It is used in our kitchen. THe cord is a good length, the sound is ok. BUt the frustrating part is the caller id does not work. Perhaps I needed to do something to set it up? We do have caller-id with our phone service and our cordless phones tell who is calling."
1,It didn't work!,"I bought this because I needed a phone in my apartment, which is really too small to merit a cordless. And I needed caller-ID. But I returned the product because even though I followed the instructions, the instrument didn't work. Pressing the buttons to dial did absolutely nothing - and then after a couple of tries it acknowledged one or two numbers but not all. The screen for the numbers was doing its own thing - I didn't really wait to figure out what that was. Obviously the price was why I bought it, but better to pay a little more for something that actually does what it's supposed to do."
3,One of their weakest,"This album shows that War was ready to run out of gas. Only ""Gypsy Man"" and ""Me And Baby Brother"" rank up there with their best. The rest of the album, while not boring, is not the best War has done. Pick this up after ""The World Is A Ghetto"" and ""Why Can't We Be Friends."""
1,Disappointment,"I had hoped to get a deal, a good headset for around $30. Jabra's description of it on their sight looks good but it had trouble communicating with my phone. It continually dropped words unless I held the phone no more than six inches away from the headset while I was using it. Kind of defeats the point. would be a great headset if the bluetooth reception was not so abysmal."
1,DOA,This product was DOA out of the box. It was returned for credit. I replaced it with a product from another manufacturer.
2,"Oh, snap! (literally)","Anyone know where to get replacement ear hooks for this thing? Judging by the deafening sound of crickets chirping, I'll take that as a ""no."" My hook snapped and unless I can find one of these 5-cent parts, I'm going to have to drop more bucks for another headset. That would be painful, but the other issues I have with this headset might make another purchase easier to swallow. The sliding microphone was a good selling point for me until I figured out that even a slight bump of the slider while scratching my nose would kill the call. Shouldn't you have to slide it all the way in to end the call? You'd think. They should call it ""hands-free"" because you'd better not get your hands anywhere near it while your talking! I also had a strange problem with the picture and sound on my digital cable TV breaking up while using the headset. My old headset never caused a problem. The sound was good and it hung securely, so that's worth a couple stars, but I'd keep looking."
5,The best of the best at their best!,"The SFU Pipe Band has set new standards for bagpipe tone, execution, and overall musicality in competition. They've won the World title 4 of the last 8 eight years. This disc captures their best competition performances at the Worlds. It's worth every penny. Terry Lee, Jack Lee, Reid Maxwell, and all of the players in the band over the years deserve to be called legends of piping."
4,Good is a four letter word!,"Do you like the raw boned truth, as ugly as it may be, dragged from the shadows and held up in the bright light? As a retired Special Agent for U.S. Customs and the author of a book about the ""Drug War"" (FADED COLORS), I applaud the guts displayed by Darlene Catalan. Knowing the long arm of the Treasury Department, I may question her sanity but I don't question her guts. Well done Agent, you are a loyal American in spite of the institutional meat grinder brush with which you will undoubtedly be painted. And if you're a literary snob who likes your i's dotted just so and every T cleary crossed, give this work a wide birth. It isn't written by a desk jockey, it's written by a street cop that has been thrown under the U.S. Custom's Service's bus! Darlene isn't trying to impress you with her prose, she is trying to send you a message; one which if ignored will cost you one hell of alot more than the price of her book."
2,I think they are rejects,"I have been using these containers for years for my salad dressing for lunch. Mine were getting worn out so I puchased these new ones. I expect the lids to be tighter to put on, but it is nearly impossible to do! It really seems that the lids are a little too big for the container. I have had new ones before and never had this problem. Makes me think they are rejects. I will but from Rubbermaid next time."
2,Tony Hawk's Project 8,I purchased this game at my daughter's Christmas request. I don't think she was impressed because she later traded it in for a different game.
1,Not a Fan,"I have been playing the Tony Hawk games since the first one on Playstation. I however, stopped keeping up after THUG came out. Recently I purchased a PS3, and wanted a newer THPS game. I ended up choosing Project 8, because of the price and people didn't seem to like Proving Ground. I was horribly disappointed with this game. First of all, you can't disable auto-kick, which is a huge let down for anyone who actually skates. Also, the semi-realistic scaling achieved in THUG, has seem to disappear completely. Second, they removed some of the most iconic skaters from the game, THPS without Reynolds, gimme a break. Third, the game is rated T for teen, but game play seems to have been created with children in mind. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone who skates, or is over the age of 12."
5,Scare off the Critters !!,I use this to accurately hit trees and make NOISE !! No more critters in my back yard....
5,A fascinating look at 10 different cuisines,"I have been trying to buy a copy of this book on Amazon ever since hearing the authors speak at the Cascadia Culinary Arts conference here in Washington on May 22 (they were incredible) but it's been ""out of stock"" for weeks. VERY frustrating. I wish that I had bought a copy at the conference, but I didn't want to carry it around at the time. If I knew how hard it would be to find a copy, I would have! I spent two hours reading a friend's copy of ""The New American Chef"" and found it fascinating. The authors joked that it's the ""Cliff Notes"" of 10 different cuisines, but it's so much more. I love the idea of their ""culinary compass"" that they wrote about in the beginning of the book that maps out the way chefs cook today, and whether their focus is on experimentation or authenticity. It was obvious from their talk and from what I saw of this book that they think about food differently from other writers. I want my own copy!"
5,Stunning debut!,"Don't be fooled into thinking this is your typical ""Western"" novel. It's that, sure, but so much more. Barger's lively writing fills the page with as much scope and depth as do the mountain ranges that litter the beautiful landscape of this stunning debut novel. Make it tops on your list for summer reading this year!"
5,Looks very elegant and well made,"I needed some type of dessert bowl and chose this one because they looked nice and were inexpensive. They arrived nicely packaged. The bowls are not large, just perfect for 2-3 scoops of ice cream. Very nice presentation adds to the quality of the produce. I use it on a regular basis for mousse and ice cream. I wash them in a dishwasher without any problems. Very satisfied with the product. If you need something small and elegant, but still inexpensive to serve dessert in, this is the choice."
1,"Beautiful, but arrived broken!! A big FAIL!","These Bormioli Rocco Alaska Dessert Bowls are indeed beautiful. Too bad two of the six were broken upon arrival, and another one was chipped. Very inadequate packaging, to say the least. I sent the box back the same day I got it, am not going to bother with replacements from Amazon. My money and I are headed to Bed Bath & Beyond."
2,Bad packaging results in broken product,"Sorry to say we have to downgrade this product so long as it is shipped out in crappy packaging resulting in broken product when it arrives. We ordered these in plenty of time for a birthday gift, but not enough time to ship them back and get more because one arrived broken!"
4,very good,"Only 25 out trips; however there is a lot of information about them including when they are open and how to get there even by public transportation. It also notes how long it takes to get there and how long you have to walk from a train station. Maps of the 25 places are included, which look quite thorough. I plan to use it the next time I am in London early next year."
4,This item is wonderful,"I love this lotion, I have tried a bunch, including Jergens, Cetaphil, Olay, St Ives, and a bunch more and haven't been to impressed... but this lotion really does moisturize your skin and keep it moisturized for hours! :) It smells great and feels wonderful, not greasy when you first put it on. My skin feels super soft. The only downside to this product is that it is a tad expensive and the bottles really aren't that big, but its worth it!"
3,This donut has a hole,"I enjoyed The Simpsons Movie and am a big Simpsons fan so I was eager to get the soundtrack. I actually purchased it first over iTunes but somehow lost it. When I saw that I could get the limited edition, I went for it. My major disappointment is that there are no snippets of dialogue here as there are in the TV series soundtracks and the instrumentation is less distinguished that I was hoping for. An orchestral version of the theme is nice but there's so much humor in the TV tracks (even without dialogue) I was sorry not to hear more here (although the choral Spider Pig bit is fun). Nevertheless, I enjoy having the donut packaging and the music as part of my small but fun Simpsons collection."
5,One of my favorite books about Laos,"As a Southeast Asian scholar that has read plenty of books about Laos, I truly recommend Brett Dakin's book. Although, as he well says, it is not an academic work, Dakin succeeds in providing an accurate, brilliant, and fresh account of contemporary Laos. The fact that the information he provides can only be made available by someone who lived in Laos and who managed to take a close look at this Asian country and its people makes it a very valuable work. Definitely, one of my favorite books about Laos!Araceli Gomez"
4,Review of Another Quiet American,This book is a pretty good read and shares the author's experiences about his time in Laos. His descriptions concerning the life and culture of Laos in modern times are refreshing. The communist society has many shortcomings and the author shares them while taking them in stride with daily life in Laos. Most of his experiences was within one city (Vientiene)but it is well written and from a fair perspective. Definitely worth reading if you either want to visit Laos or perhaps served there prior to 1975. The comparison is entertaining. The author seems to take the government intrusions without much problem. Perhaps because he knew he could return to the USA after his employment was done. The author is highly respective of the Lao people and that shows in his writing.
4,Good place to start,"This is a very good place to start learning to play the tinwhistle or fife. Contains instructions on how to play and read music, basics as well as ornamentation on the whistle. The tune selection ranges from European and U.S. traditional, classical to jazz, and more. The companion CD contains lessons and tunes from throughout the book. The reason I don't give the set five stars is because most of the tunes in the book aren't represented on the CD, but as there are hundreds of tunes that is somewhat understandable. Still enough tunes are on the CD to help the beginner develop a solid foundation on the whistle."
5,Underrated Moody Classic,"I absolutely agree with Mr. Clifford's review, I love this album and feel that the whigs really came into their own with this one. Greg Dulli is a wonderful lyricist and writer, I was so happy with this album I went out after hearing of the Twilight Singers album (their first one) and was really let down. I heard a song off Blackberry Belle and fell for it imediately, thought ""man he has come back to this album's sound, awesome!"". I have not picked up the Blackberry album yet, it will be my next purchase however. I have every Whigs album with the exception of Congregation, and I love them all, mostly all... Gentlemen is great but in different ways, this album with all it's dark narrative and moody, languishing crying out for forgiveness, haunting beauty I definitely give it a Fiver. It is truly a classic carved into it's own category which I challenge anyone to compare this sound and writing to? Buy it, I think it stands on it's own quite well."
1,it'll never get off the ground,"The 747 video, produced in 1989 is incredibly dated, with poor video quality and too much background information on the Boeing company and not enough on the plane itself. The 777 segment reuses much of the same content and has many glaring errors where the voiceover does not match the video. For example: the British Hermes airliner is discussed as footage of a Lockheed Constellation is shown, and the manufacturing process of the 777 is discussed while showing footage of a 747 under construction. It's obvious that the producers of the 777 segment did not bother to research their subject matter and merely hacked the show together with footage they had available to them. Avoid this video and visit Just Planes Videos for serious commercial aviation videos produced by true enthusiasts for true enthusiasts."
4,Seer's Blood,"This Book is very well written and is full of rich deep color, that allows a reader to stand in the middle of the field and be apart of the whatever is going on.Although this book does have familiar themes found in other Durgin books, this one does deivate and gives you another sit to her ability to write.Seer's Blood take place in a world were 90% of the world (the good guys - think 1600's) is about to rediscover Magic. While the other 10% (The bad guys - If you have ever seen the movie Fallen with Denzel Washington, the bad guy is book and movie have the same power to touch and take over a body) knows about it and uses their brand of magic to dominate the world. In fact the want to control the re-emerging magic.The book is fast pace, but it does get confusing at times. The action is most believeable. This book like Durgin other books address the issue of how one woman breaks the chains that bind her gender so that she can save it."
4,Excellent film.,"I liked it very much. Very thought provoking. Love scenes were a little too graphic for my tastes, but they were a small part of the film. The rest was really terrific."
5,if you like first encounters - this will be just your cup of tea!,"A great, classic first-encounter novel for the 21st century: think Childhood's End, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and To Serve Man, served up with the cutting-edge media savvy of Jon Stewart. Lerner writes with grace, surety, humor, and political wisdom that draws on sources ranging from Damocles to Churchill. I snapped up this novel on Cape Cod Bay, and learned anew why I relish science fiction."
3,Unfortunately not their greatest work; but still good,"This is the weakest of the Levellers later works (1990 onwards). This is their most mainstream album, a sharp change from their occasional folk music and use of tin whistles and didgereedoos. However, it is still good with such songs as 'Hope St.' and one of their 'manifesto' songs (like 'Dance Before The Storm'), 'Men-an-Tol'. It also includes their biggest hit as a single, the annoyingly short 'Just the One'! While this is something of a transitional CD, leading to their greatest work (so far), 'Mouth to Mouth', it would be a good addition to anyone's collection. Perhaps not the best intoduction to the Levellers' music, it may be appreciated more by current fans or people looking for a more populist style of music."
2,IF YOU WANNA TAKE THIS SINGLE AND PUT IT IN THE TRASH?,"I had so much trouble getting this single because it was lost in the mail and I couldn't wait to hear it but than when I got it it sounded horrible. The first track is kind of good its just a faster version of the original beat. Tracks 2 - 5 have a good beat but were is all the singing, you have to wait like 3 mins into the instrumental part until they start singing, but these tracks would probably be good to dance to in a club. the last track number 6, is horrible it is 2 mins and 9 secs long and their is NO singing at the end of the track they just sing ""cause you wanna take my picture"" and the the track is over! I would not recomend this CD unless if your a really big filter fan."
2,Not absorbent - too big.,"I'm a big guy, so I thought I wouldn't mind the larger size of these towels - 24""x36"". I was wrong though.These towels are more like tiny bedsheets than towels. After I purchased these, I read the Cook's illustrated review that summed it up perfectly - ""towel or tablecloth?"" Too large.The towels are thin and not very absorbent. I found one good use for them - to line a tortilla warmer or picnic baskets. To clean up a messy ktichen or dry dishes - look elsewhere."
2,Flimsy,I've never been so disappointed in a purchase. The towels are thin--not much use to me. It wasn't worth the effort to return.
2,The movie was better,This one time when the movie surpassed the book. The author could nor decide which story he wanted to tell.
5,one of the best ever,"This is one of the best books I've read recently, and maybe one of the best ever. Considering that two recent reads are Margaret Atwoods' The Blind Assassin and Jonathan Lethem's Motherless Brooklyn, that is saying a lot! It earns all of the strong reviews, and then some. Partway through, I became slightly impatient, wondering where this was going, or if, in fact, it was going anywhere. I kept reading , though, because I was intrigued and charmed by all the diferent stories and the different voices. By the end, the book just took my breath away. These characters will stay with me for a long time and it was a privilege to meet them"
4,Playful ensemble piece w/ interesting character development.,"The book reminds me of a well done Robert Altman film. The story is background to the development of character in an ensemble environment. In the end, the sum is greater than the pieces.Essentially this is a series of intertwined short stories concerning the intersection of lives and love in a smallish town, the sort of place where even after on has loved and lost the former love is still part of the scene and a major intersect point in the carrying on of life. There are no ""deep revelations"" and the book never orients itself to judge the nature of love--seemingly a major failing if you read previous reviews. (I find it hard to condemn an effort for not accomplishing something it never set out to do, but whatever.) This is a deft and engaging effort that I think most folks-if they will only accept it for what it is and portends to be--highly engaging beach fare--will like enormously, as I did."
1,Recycled and Masticated,Some books are truly repugnant to deserve a well-written review. But this book is just plain boring. I can't believe people like this book because it's just one cliched situation after another. Charles Baxter betrays his gender by writing such a melodramatic womanhood-embracing .... I wished I could've spent the time reading this book ....
3,Wry,"I really enjoy ensemble works like this, in which so many characters get to voice their thoughts, and they all connect with each other. Baxter has a nice style, with wry humor, adjectives which also fit the principal character, Bradley.Love in its various facets is the thematic link of all the sub-plots, just as the park and coffee shop are the physical links. The amount to which Baxter relies on fantastic sex to move things along bothered me a bit. More to the point, I happened to see a Tom Stoppard play last night, ""Rock and Roll"", which in a brief scene between husband and dying wife was so much more profound about the nature of love than anything in this novel."
4,A Feast for the Mind,"I really enjoyed this book by Charles Baxter. It is a thought provoking story and its words are able to unveil the truth and the essence of what real love is.The book is a series of stories told by varying characters who give us their greatest insight into love and its truest meaning. All of the people are brought vividly to life, each one being strong and unique in their own right. While each of the characters' knows how it feels to love, they also learn about the loss of love. Everyone has felt at some point like one of the characters in this book, we all know the sting of love found and love lost.I would definitely recommend this book. It's insight into human nature and the effects of love, all different types of love, on the spirit makes for a compelling read."
4,A Dreamy Smorgasbord,"Dishes of love, set out on a sheet-covered table, include spicy female enchantment, a pale abandonment, tender young shoots of everlasting love, passion that overwhelms reason, and reason that temporarily overwhelms passion.As the caterer for this dinner, Baxter does not refrain from some bitters and sours to temper his sweets and delights. He displays all and shows the empty plates as well.I felt contented and sleepy as I finished this novel. I had tastes and samples of loves, and I had something in my tummy to digest for a while as well. Something to talk about and something to think about.One reason you should read this book is to be able to resonate with one or more of the characters in their love experience and finally to find and hold hope in your own heart."
4,Good Value,"This is a great first scooter. Non-skid surface makes it hard for little ones to slip while they are scooting, but if they do it will surely scrape knees as it is very rough. It is very quick and easy to assemble. It comes with some stickers on it that don't stick very well but still an unbeatable value at $7.99."
5,Excellent polishing kit !!,"Love this polishing cloth kit, these Cape Cod cloths work wonders on scratched polished metal. I use them to restore scratched/worn watch bracelets. The storage tin is also a nice addition.Highly recommended product."
5,Smells nice,"This product is not messy. It still requires elbow grease, but it does remove the tarnish. It looks as if it will last a long time."
4,Ear Candy,"This album was so much more than its big single, ""Sucked Out."" Hook ridden and filled with noise, this album is pure ear candy. Check them out live, they rock."
5,I notice a difference,"This is the one I got. I did a bunch of research and this one seems to really work well, I have noticed a difference with my son's allergies and it's funny how my son's room really doesn't have much dust at all on his dresser since we go this too. It is super quiet (and I have tried a few and read tons of reviews). It kicks up and gets louder when it detects a need too (if you have it on auto). It also ionizes the air without hurting the ozone, like some of those do (if you even believe/care about that kind of thing). Two of the filters can be put in the dishwasher when needed (it has an indicator light to tell you when). Only the hepa filter has to be replaced (every few years). Anyway, I am sure there are better ones out there for more money. ??? But this is what I found after doing HOURS of research and I am pretty happy with it...for what it is."
4,Works Well,"Seems to work well. Only shortcoming seems to be an overly bright control panel display which lights up the bedroom too much at night. A simple photo-sensor which automatically dims the display when the room is dark would be something logical in a unit this expensive.They supply a stick-on plastic film to darken it, but it's so dark that you cannot see the display. A email resulted in a somewhat less dark stick on film replacement being sent; but the real solution would be the photo-sensor mentioned above.They do seem to be very supportive from a customer service point of view, but only four stars for the poorly designed display."
4,Excellent Product,"Although the Rabbit Air BIOGS 582A is a bit expensive, it is a well built product and seems to do an excellent job cleaning the air in our house. It is attractive looking, quiet to run, the filters are easy to clean and replace, and the replacement filters are reasonably priced. The manual is well written and the unit's panel easy to use. I now have two Rabbit Air purifiers and would buy both again if I had to replace them. If it hadn't been for the higher price, I would have rated it five stars."
2,Incredibly short and all post-conquest,This is more of an introduction than the whole story. It's obviously a one hour show without the commercials. 90% of it is not about The Aztec Empire but instead of how the Spanish took over the Aztecs. Better to wait and see if it's repeated on the History channel.
