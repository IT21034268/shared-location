4,"""Sci-Fi film score collectors""","The follow up album is actually much better than Volume One and seems to be concentrating on the ""Original Soundtrack"" arrangments more. While the series fans and avid film score collectors will prefer the original soundtracks, this is still quite good and entertaining.Some stand outs - ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN (Leon Klatzkin) which is not heard on too many compilations - DARK STAR (John Carpenter) another selection seldom issued - DOCTOR WHO (Ron Grainer) well represented arrangement - and BUCK ROGERS IN THE 25TH CENTURY (Glen Larson) much hailed series with this familar and enjoyable theme.This collection from GNP/Crescendo Records is a must for any Sci-Fi film score collector, from the small tube to the BIG SCREEN, good variety of tracks on this ""2nd Venture"" into the realm of space and beyond.Total Time: 33:51 on 14 Tracks/ GNP-Crescendo Records - GNPD 2122 (1986)"
1,Beware,"I read a book entitled ""latticework"" by the same author and I ordered this title thinking it would be a continuation of the subject. Unfortunately it is the same book with the different title. I am a little ticked because it was not obvious when I submitted my order"
5,I am really enjoying this,"Perhaps it is a little bit early for me to evaluate this course, because I am now listening to the 5th CD. At least I can say that I am really enjoying this Russian course. Although Russian is a hard language to learn, this course makes me enjoy the study.My study of English has been a lot harder and somtimes painful. Some people say that this course does not give you a vocabulary big enough to be fluent in Russian. I will think about that kind of problems when I finish this."
3,Dated material,"While I've long respected the Davis Drug Guide as a quality reference book, I am disappointed in Amazon.com for not indicating that this was a 2003 edition. As a nurse, I need up to date material. The Drug guide I was using was nearly as current as the this one I just purchased. This very deceptive practice makes me feel very cautious [...]."
1,used,"i'm sure the book is a good read, that's why i ordered it. but, the link i ordered it from said the book was NEW. i just got it today and the book is visably USED! even has the name of the previous owner on the top. if you're really looking for this book, have your local book store order it for you, or get it on your kindle."
2,The pain......,"Oh the pain, make it stop. The gameplay here is so repetitive it actually hurts. Basically, you've got Tempest with more colors and better music. Heck, I just spun through the tubes as fast as I could while blasting away without thinking and finished the first several levels. Weak."
1,Gross,The replacement decanter arrived USED. The box had clearly been opened previously and there was DRIED COFFEE on the inside bottom of the decanter; whomever had used the decanter didn't even bother to clean it properly. GROSS.
4,Cruel mindbenders' powers Overthrown!,"The planet of Clio is split into warring factions but a series of consolidations are under way so that there are only a small number of buffer states between two huge powers. When the offworlders arrive to examine the unusual development of Clio, they find that an alien race has been there before them and conditioned the rulers into following alien plans. This left the terrans in a quandry - do they obey their noninterventionist policies, or try to do something for the trapped inhabitants?"
2,Majority Were Broken,Received the package on time however majority of the candy canes were broken. As a result I will be looking somewhere else next year.
5,Wonderful Book!,"For new watchers, or long time fans, this is a wondeful book. I really enjoyed the indepth photos and recipies. The interviews gave me insights to the show that I didn't have before. Do yourself a favor and buy this book!"
2,Good,Good small glossy table book. Too bad there were only a few recipes from the challengers. I really wanted some of the Iron Chef concoctions.Looked through this once and never again. Nice package though.
4,Too much fun!!,"Never thought I'd be in a cult, but I'm proud to be a part of the Iron Chef movement! And like most good cultists, I've done my part to bring others into the fold. My only surprise with this book is that it is small! On the TV ads, it looks like a coffee table book and instead it is more the size of a TV Guide. I didn't expect anymore than was here, and what was included was indeed fun. I learned many tid-bits that are great to throw into conversations when we're watching the chefs throw a live eel around!!"
5,Dark Shadows DVD 14,the DVDs were in great condition. I purchased from Allen Turner3. I received an immediate response from the seller informing me that the DVDs were in the mail. I received them in 3 days. I would purchase from Allen in the future and suggest that others do so as well.
3,Good storyline but doesn't feel enough like DS,"DS started off about being about Victoria Winters and her attempt to find her roots in Collinsport, Maine. Later it became about a vampire named Barnabas who is romantically fascinated with Victoria. By the 1897 storyline Vicki's gone."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"Like most people who have listened to any of Chris Botti's previous recordings, I thought I'd really love ""Night Sessions."" However, I was extremely disappointed when I listened to this, what I consider boring CD. That's right, boring. The first two tunes weren't bad, nothing to write home about but passable. By the time I got to the eighth track I could no longer check my impulse to hit the fast forward button. I couldn't even finish listening to the last tune on the CD. This one's going straight to the used CD store. This is truly a shame because his ""Slowing Down The World"" CD is one of my favorites. All the more reason that ""Night Sessions"" was such a disappointment."
4,Shock pen,"This pen is a great gag, and it really shocks good! I have got a lot of my friends with this. The only bad thing about it is that it is not very durable. after about a month, little pieces started to come off. It still works, but if you shake it around it will fall apart."
3,Fun but not durable,"I brought this to work and got all my friends and boss's and it was hilarious. But after a couple drops it breaks open and when you put it back together, it takes a little bit to get back to shocking. This is a pretty shocking toy to buy."
2,worked great as a gag! broke quickly thereafter....,"Got this for my daughter for christmas and she loved it! It worked great! really big shock! however after about a month it broke. Not sure if that's the lifetime of the product but we've gotten the shocking gag items before (cell phones, pack of gum) and they always lasted a lot longer.Not bad for a gag- but doesn't last."
4,Great compilation,"The essential Cornell Campbell is all here. A great compilation for those who are new to his music and collectors. Disc one is a compilation of his 70's hits and disc two is a collection of the 80's songs. Most of those tracks are produced by Bunny Lee so the quality is guaranteed.I wouldn't call Cornel Campbell, a competition to Bob Marley or even close, but this CD collection is a must have For all Reggae fans."
1,Not well remastered,"I own this cd, and thought that the reason I never listened to it was because I was tired of The Boswell Sisters. I was wrong! After hearing clear, cleanly remastered tracks, I now understand that it's the poor sound quality on this disk that has kept it off the player.Please shop around and do some comparative listening and you'll soon understand exactly what I'm talking about.I loved them on vinyl! I just had to find an audio engineer who cared enough to provide the quality remaster that these wonderful singers deserve!"
4,Nice stand,"It was very easy to assemble. It is a little wide for theCasio PX-130 88-Key Digital Stage Piano. Folds up easily for transport or storage. The adjustable height is great using the keyboard a different heights.Since the height adjustment knob is only on one leg, on carpet it seems to be higher on one side than the other. On the lowest setting, the pin didn't lock in completely and the stand collapsed with the keyboard falling to the floor. I wish the height adjustment was on both legs and the spring in the pin was stronger."
1,Ewww...,"I usually love Igloo products and was looking for a great water bottle. This one is made of that ""squidgey"" rubber (it never feels clean to me) and the top part is cheaply made and of poor design. Not worth the hassle of returning, but I would not recommend this to anyone. It's cheaply made."
1,Spyware detected in this software,"I installed this, only to have Ad-Aware indicate is has spyware in it. Apparently no longer active, but still very annoying."
1,crashes,Another disappointment. This program crashes every time my daughter starts to play and doesn't save her information so she has to start all over again each time. Absolute garbage. Who sells defective software? Apparently Gallactica doesn't mind. 3 out of 4 of the Carmen Sandiego programs we bought from them failed to work.
5,a life saver,"This book has changed my life. It taught me exactly why I ended up in my abusive relationship and how to fix my own issues. If you are in or recently left an abusive relationship, I highly suggest reading this, it could save your life!"
5,BEST BOOK EVER,"I had idea just how sick I was until I read this book many years ago. I even have it on audio. I have still not found Mr Right, but at least I know what is a sick relationship is and get out quick."
2,TRUTH: BOOK IS GOOD BUT LYING IS A PROBLEM...,"While this book did have a lot of helpful information for people with codependency problems in relationships, it is very, very important to bear in mind that MANY of the clients discussed in the book are in reality, fictional. Norwood later admitted that ""many of her patients in the book are really just her."" (reference: Backlash:The Undeclared War Against American Women, by Susan Faludi, 1991). So although the author did take more than a few liberties with the truth, I still give it 2 stars based on some of the good info presented to help women heal and/or leave their relationships."
5,Women Love Too Much,Great reading and recommended for everyone which will help identify why you love the way you do. I love it
1,A mish/mash mess!!,"These are absolutely the worse tapes I have ever used. Nothing, absolutely nothing is useful in these lessons! They also talk about changing British Pounds. Of course, they now must be updated to teach you how to convert Euros not Lire.I have studied Italian tapes for years and this is the first time I have ever encountered "" Molto Lieto"" for ""How do you do?"" I have been going to Italy for 30 years and I have, ever heard that expression.Save your money! dont' buy this mish mash mess!!!If I could I would give this no stars."
2,Don't Buy This Book,"This book isn't worth the price you pay. It comes with a cassette tape, and I was hoping the tape would teach me the language. In fact, you have to learn every word in the book before you can work with the tape. Also, the book lists no translation for the conversations...it's all in Italian. Don't waste your time or your money on this one."
5,Agreed,"Completely agree with the first reviewer's comments. So many dance music CDs have only a couple of good tracks, but this one is great all the way through."
5,A really lovely book.,I read this book a couple of years ago and really really love it. The story stays with you.... Fuentes is an amazing writer.
1,Eggshell Engineering. Are These Designed To Be Disposable?,"While the sound quality is fine, the construction of these earphones is a disaster. A duster pushed the unit off of its base from which it fell six inches or so onto the table on which it was sitting, resulting in the breakage and separation of the right part of the unit. As a consequence, the right earphone just dangles and cannot be reattached, rendering the unit useless. The earphones were less than one year old, not subject to heavy use and are either made of flimsy material or engineered poorly. If this is representative of what AR is turning out, one may wish to avoid the brand. Certainly avoid these earphones."
2,"Sounds good, comfortable, but sadly unreliable","These are very comfortable to wear for long periods, and sound good. Battery life is very poor, however, and need to be charged every day unlike other wireless headphone I've used that can last 3 to 4 days between charging. My biggest complaint is mechanically and electrically they are junk. A constant irritation is you can hardly turn the things off. Sometimes you have to press the off switch for more than a minute, and often it takes several attempts. I am gentle with them, but they physically broke after a few months - the swivel post that holds the ear pieces to the frame broke. I did a creative glue job and gave up the swivel feature, which bought me another couple of weeks. At that time they just died completely, and I never got an additional peep out of them. I paid a high price for these at another retailer, and am very annoyed."
5,Good Purchase to buy,"3 Girl action all going down town at once on a train posisiton and some really great video of these girls.One cute girl gets off big time, all by her self. Good one to buy"
3,Don't waste your money on this book,"I think that this book doesn't live up to the title that it deserves. Basically, it's a book that tells you everyhting about 'N Sync that most people know all ready. There are a few pictures, but they are not that great. I advise to actually get a book you'll enjoy and find out information that you don't know yet about 'N Sync!"
1,doesnt even work!!,"I give this game zero stars. I used to love the croc games when I was younger, so I bought this one, and it doesnt even work!! At all!!"
1,Croc 2,"We bought this for our child and were very dissapointed. First, the controls were very inacurate causing her to constantly feel like she wasn't ""good"" at it. We encouraged her that she is great...the game is the problem! Not a reccommendation for children's self-esteem. Then the game was boring after just a week. We finally shelfed it and won't even sell it as we feel so strongly that it is not properly marketed as a children's game. Very poor."
4,A great speaker at this low price,"The one reviewer who rated them one star WITHOUT LISTENING TO THEM should be ignored. I have two pair of theses speakers installed in rear walls and side walls for 7.1 system and they work fine. I had someone over last weekend and I had to point the speakers out for him, he had never noticed them before [he had been in the house 6 to 8 times before]. I turned the speakers off and went to stereo and then he noticed them right away! I am very happy with them and and the ""disappear"" when the speaker grilles are painted wall color. That was the idea when I got them. A pair of three way, in the wall, eight inch woofer speakers for $80 to $90 is a GREAT deal. I may now put three of them in the front as main and center speakers cause the wife does not like the large speakers I am using there now. I am running these speakers with Audiosource's ""low boy"" subwoofer which is also a fine speaker and works very well."
3,Overdesigned,"There's plenty of full-color ""food porn,"" but the overdesigned text--several different type styles within each recipe, with the ingredients list in illegible italics--and small typeface make this cookbook difficult to read and use. Some pages have white type on top of the color photo, which is really annoying. The recipes look good, though a majority of them require curry leaves, which are impossible to get fresh unless you live in an area with an Indian grocery or want to pay an exorbitant price to have them shipped."
2,A Very Average Vegetarian Cookbook!,I have quite an enviable collection of South Indian cookbooks which I have been using for some years now. I am indeed versatile in this art of cooking as my husband and I always go in for a healthy form of vegatarian cooking.What is nice about this cuisine is that a huge variety of greens and lentils are used for various dishes. They are delectable and good to prepare healthy for the stomach when eaten in a balanced form!Some of the dishes in 'Dakshin' are too strong in spices and it does burn the tongue. This is not typical of a South Indian tamil household. Using less chillies is still good in bringing out the flavor of the dish.I have one more book of the South Indian vegetarian cooking that I purchased from Amazon. This is a really good book!
5,Good South Indian cookbook,The book arrived as advertised. I have gone through the book and read through recipes and can recall what my mother used to make in India. I think it is a good book for south indian recipes.
3,Not too bad,"I think this movie is an okay choice if you run out mega movies to watch. Don't expect too much though. It looks like something you'll find on A&E; channel.The movie is about this woman who had a cornea transplant from a dead donor and she ended up seeing how this donor was killed. From then on you can pretty much guess the rest of the story.So the plot is average. Acting has its good moments for a B movie but it got worse towards the end. Editing, script, sound, camera, special effects are nothing to speak about.AND IT'S NOT A CREEPY movie as the name suggested.. just so you know.As I said, rent it only if you have nothing good to watch."
3,Not Bad...very interesting plot...,"So why the 3 stars...well, this film was pretty good, had a least one big name star in the cast, but it did seem a bit ""Monday Night Movie-ish"" but that is ok. This appears to be one of those movies that you do not hear a lot of...if anything!! The story was interesting, and it did keep me interested in what it had to offer. Not a bad effort in the least!"
1,like sleeping on rocks,"I purchased this pillow hoping it would help my TMJ but it was so hard I could not sleep on it without it increasing my pain, this pillow is like sleeping on rocks but my husband liked it so I gave it to him."
2,"Great movie, buuuutttttt","I've been looking for a good version of this film for quite a while, since Celestial Films didn't find it worthwhile to provide the English speaking world English-dubbed Shaw Brothers DVDs. In any event, I've found great satisfaction with the Red Sun DVDs. That is, until I got this one.The DVD box will tell you that the film is the uncut version. That is true. The video and sound quality on the other hand is HORRID. I would hesitate to say if it's even VHS-quality (which is probably where this transfer came from).So I will say this to anyone thinking about getting this DVD...it's the full movie. Uncut and unedited. But be warned...the video and sound quality will leave you cold."
2,to few bags,"this is too few bags for the price i hit the wrong button so it's on me, but i won't be buying these again unless it is higher quantity"
3,sermonized,"If you're looking for an academic treatise, this isn't it. The chapters read like sermons--good sermons--but do not represent the kind of study I was looking for."
2,"Okay songs -- disappointing, Sarah sings one song","The album is okay but not your regular selection of Christmas songs. Sarah Brightman has only one song on the album, so if you are looking for her beautiful voice, you'll be disappointed."
3,LAL Review,"The illustrations are beautiful! However, the words to the song did not depict the story very well. The story needed more than the song to get the story across to the reader. I found myself reading the story twice to understand it. The age range for the story needs to be changed. ""All ages"" is totally inappropriate. In the classroom the teacher could use the illustrations to allow the students to create their own story for the book."
2,Not the best choice,"When Qi Gong developed in China for more than 20 years, Chinese people finally find Falun Gong is the most effective. So there are more than 100 million Chinese people practice Falun Gong before the government's persecution.But western society seems still enjoy the low level Qi Gongs.Why not directly start from high level Falun Gong? It is not difficult. When you try, you will know.There is an old Chinese saying: ""Learn from the best""."
5,This is a worthy addition to your library!,"I use this as a reference work, but it is also written on a level where I can offer it to people with only a basic interest in Caesar, Rome or Ancient Warfare. A must for ancient's wargamers, historians and students of military history. There have been conflicting opinions, but this work is well worth the reading. If you came here looking for a good work on Caesar's military, or the Roman Army of the 50's BC, buy this one!"
2,"A dry, technical, and academic look at queer subculture","A dry, technical, and academic look at queer subculture in London between 1918 and 1957. Interesting in that it reduces to a science the rather inexpressible notions and progressions of gay life. There is certainly a parallel to be found between the passive->excluded->marginalized->subculture->pride progression of gays and other social movements. Houlbrook tries to weave in personal stories that humanize the concepts presented, and while he does a good job in those parts, the people reading such a book are in no need of convincing; the parts serve only to make the technical bits endurable. A great book, I'm sure, for academics, but not for pleasure reading.Continued at: [...]"
4,comparative subjects,"the book is written in the vain of comparative religion and philosophy as perceived in the mid 1800's and was intended to enlighten members of the scottish rite freemasonry as to what the degrees they went through should bring to mind..each chapter was to represent a degree..each degree was about a year of time of learning and study on the members part..many members never made it to the highest ranks but only to the 14th..it is definitely a hard read but well worth the time, effort and money involved in the pursuit of knowledge, both current and archaic..remember that latin and hebrew were subject that were taught in the 1800's in the schools and is used throughout the book."
2,Masonic Occult Hype...,"In reading the above reviews I am still amazed that people place so much importance on this all but worthless fraternity. If there is one thing you can learn from reading this book you should understand that Masonry in Pike's time is nothing compared to the pathetic social clubs that exist today under the title 'Mason'. Most masons I see today are either a bunch of old overweight, white trash men or arrogant young blacks both of which are literaly without a clue. Whether or not you see Masonry as occult or satanic or whatever one thing is for certain...it is not some powerful cabal in control of the world by any stretch of the imagination."
3,wrong dvd,"sent order quickly but was wrong dvd, then I couldn't get ahold of him for 3 days then he said he would send the correct one and I didn't receive it for 1.5 more weeks"
1,Not for trees under 5 feet,"Two major draw backs to the this unit: First, I ordered it last year, and shipping was so slow I didn't get it in time to use it last year. I see another reviewer had the same problem. Mine took over 2 weeks to get. Second, it says small tree, but does not actually work on small trees. We have a small house and always buy tress that are about 4 ft tall with a trunk diameter about 2.5 to 3 inches, and the old style stand never held it very well. So with two kids in the house now, I decided it was time for something more stable, but this doesn't cut it. Even pressed down on the nails in the bottom and with the adjustment screws as tight as they'll go, the tree still twists. The screws just aren't stable when pushed out that far. I was really hopefully, but this stand ain't for small trees."
2,Very Underwhelming. . .,"Butterfield is not a bad technician when it comes to playing the harmonica (assuming the accompanying CD is him). There are several riffs that are very impressive and entertaining. But when it comes to trying to provide the listener with instructions, he falls quite a bit short.I found that he tends to speak in generalities and makes some assumptions that, had he clarified, would have added volumes to the listener's understanding. I listened to the CD several times and never could find an instance where he actually indicates where he is about to start on the harmonica (4th hole draw, 6th hole blow, etc. . .) It is this lack of clarification that I found very distracting, and often downright frustrating.The turnaround riffs starting around track 45 are excellent. But they require the student to have mastered bending. A tough task for a newcomer.He almost has a great teaching tool here -- but I was hoping for a little better than almost. . ."
3,very good!,"Pears is awkward at times in his writing style, but otherwise it is a very good reading. I believe it is his first book, hence the awkwardness."
1,Don't buy this book,"It is difficult to write a good book on a subject one dislikes and, clearly, Johnson is not fond of the Irish."
5,A Clear Portrait of Irish History,"This is an eminently readable, informative history of Ireland from the twelfth century up to the late 1970's. Unlike many histories, it is not a list of statistics. Nor is it an appeal to our sensibilities. It is swift, yet comprehensive."
4,Usb extension cord BELKIN,"Belkin makes a great product. This is a great solution to those that need a usb extension cord. Belkin products are good and reliable. This is a good buy as well because if you walk into comp usa or best buy, you are going to spend up to 30.00 dollars for the same cord of a different make."
5,Gets the job done,I'm always pleased with a Belkin products- good quality and usually long lasting. I needed these cables for a couple of webcam extensions and they do the job.
1,Junk cheap and 'dollar store value' be warned/don't bother,Title says it all. These are very low quality cables and the female end is a joke. Look for ones that actually cover the male end you plug in and not this cheesy aluminum end like this one has.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MT1EQM/ref=oh_o04_s00_i00_detailsthis is the cable I went to and it rocked. Worked perfect for reasonable price. You'll be glad you read this post. God Bless
1,Does not Work with HP PhotoSmart premium printer,"I tried to connect my printer to the USB port in my Apple AirPort. The printer would not connect. I tried a Tripp Lite cable P/N U026-016 and the printer started working perfectly. I swapped back this the Belkin cable and the printer did not work. Went back to the Tripp Lite cable, the printer started working again, so I left everything alone. Would not recommend this cable."
2,"I'm no audiophile, but even I can tell these aren't very good","I've been planning to install a whole house audio system for some time, but have been held up selecting speakers since I don't want to spend a fortune on them. I am by no means an audiophile, and generally can't tell much of a difference between really high end speakers and normal consumer grade stuff when I listen to them in the store. Having read the other positive reviews here I figured I would try a pair of these and would be perfectly happy with them. Turns out there ARE speakers bad enough even for me to tell. These speakers are extremely tinny, sounding no better than if I cranked up the sound coming from my laptop to fill the room. I still have not selected speakers, but I cannot possibly use these."
1,Heil Kathleen!,"A queasy-making mix of self-pity, victimhood, and feigned moral supremacy, this may be the most manipulative political fiction written since Mein Kampf by A. Hitler! Hopefully it won't be as successful - look for it soon on remainder tables at your local superstore!"
4,"This is a good book, but not as good as it could be.","This book includes all the basics about No Doubt, but it doesn't have all the details that their hardcore fans, like me, want. It has alot of good pictures but you can find many of them already on lots of No Doubt sites on the net. But all in all it's a good book for new ND fans to read."
3,more on info,I thought it was well written but it needed to be more descripted and more stuff about No Doubt such as stuff that fans don't know! But the bottom line it was great!
1,The Hobbit,I found this book tedious because the author went into page of detail on just about everything that happened
4,Not As Good As The First,"Although better than ""Knocked Out By My Nunga Nungas"", this doesn't even come close to being as funny and fresh as ""Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging"" the premier edition of Georgia's angst ridden diaries.There was lots of Libby - my favourite character, and the one who keeps the entire book from reverting to Georgia adding ""osity"" to the end of every second word and whining about Dave the Laugh, her vati, Jas, Slim or some other petty aspect of her life.That's the way the books are, and it was funny the first time around, but it's starting to get old. The author should considering thinking of some major plot events that could happen in the next book and some truly original humour before publishing the next book.I will probably still read the next installment, for a few cheap laughs and because I'm a sucker and want to find out what happens next, but my advice would be to wait until this comes out on paperback."
2,STEADY ON THA COME DOWN,"This album was a massive let down overall, some of the beats were ok, but nothin stand out here."
1,really not what I thought,"The book was not as detailed as I thought it would be from the description. It covers very basic billing information. As well some of the information is not up to date. For someone just getting into telecomm billing, not bad..I was also surprised at the lack of editing, many typos, misspelling of words, etc."
1,Waste of money!,"This is a book that can be dedicated for 1st year students to explain briefly telecommunications history and how the idea of tariffs developed.As for I expected - the meat, some new knowledge (I am a little bit in telco billing) I am completly disappointed. Info outdated, very limited amount. For very,very beginners but even for them I would recommend something different.The book also uses poor tricks to appear thicker: each text row is separated with another empty row from next. So the pages appear like poetry rather than technical book.Anyway: AVOID! Waste of money"
2,"Short battery life, very slow processor","This camera has a rechargeable battery. That means that if you take it on a trip with you, you better take the charger also because the battery won't last more than a half day of regular shooting. And, you can't charge the battery through the USB port. When you take a picture by pushing the shutter button, you better hope no one moves for a while. It takes quite some time for the camera to decide to take a picture. And, the pictures tend to be blurry. If you want better ones, always use the flash -- at least you can know for sure whether the camera decided to take the picture or not. The red eye reducer flashes about 20 times before finally taking the picture. Like other reviewers, I have really liked other Olympus cameras, but this one is near worthless."
5,Met all expectations!,The Bounty Hunter Junior Metal Dector arrived quickly and performed as described. Perfect for children 9 years old through early teens.
3,Goodbye and Good Riddance,"I still did not enjoy this as much as Bad Girl Creek but it is still a very good read. Anyone who read the first two will enjoy this. Earl turns out not to be what he seemed....or maybe more than he seemed. Beryl finally seems to come to terms with her past life. And again, all the Bad Girls come together when push comes to shove. Lord, I wish I had friends like these!"
4,Good suggestions for feeding body and mind,"Very impressed with the information in this book. Just a couple of things I'm skeptical about... how all the same color foods relate to the same color chakra's is a little far out there for me and the living water that's suppose to raise your vibration; meditation will do that for me. I was disappointed that he is pushing certain brand name items; very expensive btw, but I'm not surprised, as it's hard to pick up any book these days without a push on some products. If you're going to be eating a diet that's 80% pure organic raw food, there is no need for any type of supplementation."
5,"AWESOME book, Highly Recommended!",I have spent years researching the subject of Health & Wellness and have come to hold a great deal of respect for Dr. Gabriel Cousens. This book of his covers some wonderful and unique information. I highly recommend it.
5,Profound Transformation,"I started Cousen's diet after reading Spiritual Nutrition. It has led to meaningful, tremendous change in my spiritual life. Don't take my word, try it for yourself."
1,Where occult mets the West! ....,"The author tries to open a window to Eastern Occultism for Western readers. I don't see anything very wrong with this, other than the fact that Hinduism, Buddaism, and Occult religions are often diametricly opposed to Judeo-Christian beliefs."
2,"Huge, stubby Nautica knit pants","I ordered these lounge pants for my 6'2"" son for Christmas. When I got them I couldn't believe how short they were. I am 5'9"" and they were too short for me. The pant legs are the widest I've ever seen!!! Terrible style and look. Fabric was ok."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I received this as a Christmas gift 2007. We used this tonight and what a terrible waste of time. We took 2 bottles of white chardonnay out of the pantry, put one in the refridgerator and the other in the chiller. When I added the bottle to the chiller, it took several minutes (about 10) before it could even tell me what the current temperature was (69 degress). The book says it would take approximately 53 minutes to chill to the serving temperature of 48 degrees. Over 2 hours...yes I said 2 hours later it finally displayed CHEERS! I agree with a previouse review in that I believe the bottom of the bottle was colder then the top or internal wine temperature. Don't waste your time on this product. By the way, the one we put in the refrigerator was ready in 30min.This product isn't even close to delivering what it has promised."
4,Does what it is suppose to do,"After reading a lot of reviews about this product I finally purchased it. As other reviewers already mentioned it works OK with white wines but works perfect with red wines. It takes about one and a half hours to get the red wine to the desired temperature. You really cannot use it in the room you are eating in. It makes a loud, white noise swishing sound that can be aggravating."
1,Why bother?,Someone recommended this to my wife. What a waste. A cold bottle from the frig actually will warm up in this.
1,Good paperweight...,"Received this as a gift, and it was never able to chill a bottle of wine to a proper temperature. It might be useful as a night-light, but it definitely falls short of what it advertises."
3,Okay,This massage cushion is ok in a sense that it does what it said it would do except that i cant get the middle(lower back) area to work. It could be a bad one.
1,wisdom of listening,"I hated this book . The word ""hate"" seldom enters my vocabulary. This book has nothing to do with listening. It is about meditating and spirituality.It also had religious implications. I was offended.I wanted to focus on my listening skills. I was interested in a step by step lesson to enhance and sharpen my skills in a business enviornment .I was also looking to build better skills in a social setting."
3,not bad,My kids like shaun T better than this video. It could be great for other families just not for us.
2,Guia b?sica de la critica literaria y el trabajo de investigacion,"The book has good information, the problem many of us who bought the book is that some pages are upside down, and out of sequence. Poor work quality. Hard to work with this pages like that."
4,Great guide,This is a great book for the intermediate Spanish student. It will help you learn to organize your research and writing while giving you an opportunity to read Spanish at the intermediate level.
3,Infant Sandal,This is a great shoe for your infant. The shoe is soft and looks comfortable on their feet. The leather on the shoe does darken after a couple of wearings. The sizes do tend to run a bit large though.
4,SECOND BEST REFERENCE BOOK ON REGISTRY,"This book has the same strengths and weaknesses of all reference books on Windows 98. Each provides useful knowledge but none are able to cover every major procedure, issue, or problem in Windows 98. Perhaps, that is the underlining problem with Windows; too many topics to cover in one book.I am not fond of Windows95/98/ME but there is nothing on the market that is close to it, unless you decide to join the other eight users of Apple computers.This book provides good useful information but it does not give enough specific instructions about tweaking the registry. This book finishes a close second to ""Win 98 Registry; Little Black Book"" which is loaded with that type of information. I use both books and consider both very valuable reference materials.If you plan to work in the registry, you will need this book."
5,The journey of a boy following his dream,This book is a must for all wrestling fans and also non fans. It is one of the most enjoyable books i have ever read.
4,it was good,"it was a little less than i expected...the WWF TV hyped it up a lot. what really angered me was they said it was his life's work yet it says it took him 7 weeks in the book itself. it is a very different look into pro wrestling, and everything that goes into it i have reviewed numerous books and i am mad now that this site didnt have the member profile earlier...o well anywho this was a really good book and i wish i can write a better review but i have a tummy ache and cant put my mind on it!"
5,"he's not mankind anymore, but cactus jack-bang bang!","mankind is the goofiest wrestler in the wwf, but he's a cool guy too. too bad that he is not mankind anymore, but now he is cactus jack. have a nice day. bang bang!"
3,"Good writing, poor editing","As readers can tell from the other reviews this book is funny, comprehensive and surprisingly well written. It also contains graphic & sometimes gruesome photos. The major problem is total lack of organization, not even a table of contents. Foley just starts in & keeps on going with no attempt to address any particular subject. The book is not indexed either, a MUST for a long non-fiction work that deals with so many events & personalities. Vince McMahon, Hogan, Flair, Undertaker, the Rock, HHH, Jake the Snake and many more are here but it will take some searching to find them."
5,"Proof that Pro Wrestlers are people, too!","I recomend this book to EVERYONE even if you aren't a wrestling fan. Foley writes all about his early dreams of becoming a wrestler, the training, meeting his wife and building a family, his carer in Japan along side Terry Funk, and a bit on the late great Owen Heart. You'll smile, cheer, jeer, wince, and maybe even cry all through this book. He'll even tell you some insider wrestling terms. Wonderfully written by the man himself...NO ghostwriters! This book prooves that a man who can take so many sick bumps and lay his body on the line for his job can still have a good head on his shoulders."
4,"Mick Foley ""Busted Wide Open""","To be honest, the first 695 pages of this book were absolutely fantastic, with the book ending with Mankind's capturing of the WWF Title. This capped an incredible story of a hardworking, ""normal"" guys rise to the top of the WWF. This book made me laugh out loud, and tear up at certain apots. It is definitely a book anyone can read. I happened to buy the version of the book where there was a bonus chapter telling of Foley's travels after the big win, and also of his last match. The ending of this chapter (and the book, actually) truly takes away from a great story and a great overall book (Email me and I'll discuss it with you at length, if you want). So, if you can get yourself a copy without the ""bonus chapter"" please do so or you will be disappointed with its otherwise pessimistic ending."
5,Isn't this all fake?,"Being in the business and meeting Mick on several different occasions, I knew that he was the most intelligent wrestler that I have met. I just didn't know how articulate he actually is. I received the book on a Friday, and finished it the next day.I loved it and you will too. This book not only will take you through his incredible rise to the top, but it will let you in on a secret about wrestlers... They are real people with real problems, real emotions, real fears, and real insecurities. If anyone has a dream, if anyone is in need of a role model, Mick would be a great choice. Not because he is a ""star"" but because he sacrificed his well being for something he believed in. He followed his dream, and is living a life worth living. Sure he could have missed the pain, but then he would have missed the dance."
5,This had to be the best autobiography I've read in my life!,"WOW! Mick Foley isn't just a great wrestler, he can write like a seasoned author. I couldn't put the book down, and read it in 2 days. Even if you don't like to watch wrestling, this is still a very well-written book, and highly entertaining. For those of you that are wrestling fans, this book is a must have!"
5,Great for all Fans(not just wrestling),"Have a nice day! by Mick Foley is a great book,especially for wrestling fans as they learn how Mrs.Foley's baby boy grew up into the world of pro wrestling to where he is today. The man is totally different when it comes to writing a book,the content is excellent,the style is excellent,the grammar is not superior but it is pretty good for a guy who has been battered and bruised for a long time. From start to finish, a great book. I also recommend this book to people who do not like wrestling,who think it is fake. After reading this,you won't think that one bit. Having an ear ripped off ain't fake people!Mick Foley is a man of all areas, and my favourite wrestler of all time,and believe you me it is well worth the buy,and the best book I have ever read."
3,"a nice, light read",The people who will get the most out of this book are non-wrestling fans or part time fans who would like to know what life is like in the wrestling business and what really goes on in the mind of that big ugly freak MANKIND... quite fun.
5,The Best Book EVER!,"Mick Foley does a great job in this book, telling us about his life from his teenage years up to his days in the WWF."
5,Open the flood gates!,"Before 'Have a Nice Day!', wrestling stars were respected for their athleticism and charisma, but intelligence and personality? Since Mick demonstrated that a pro-wrestler can compete not only in the ring, but on the NY Times Bestseller list, we have seen a swarm of biographies released on almost every headliner that the business has seen in the last 20 years. From his ability to take a beating, to his love of amusement parks and kids stuff, Mick easily draws you into the glorious mind of Mankind. Foley, Foley!!"
5,A book not only for the typical wrestling fan,"I was not a wrestling fan until I read Mick Foley's book. His book showed me that there is life outside of wrestling. I thought it was great the way he let us see inside his personal life whether it was embarrasing or emotional. I normally love to read, but with this book I couldn't put it down. I was even staying up way too late just to finish a chapter. It was great. If anyone wants to read a great book, buy Mick Foley's book."
5,Excellent!,"It took me days to read this book, because I just wanted to take it slow and absorb everything. I feel like I got to know Mick real well, and his story telling was excellent! Since he's only an hour away from where I live, I even thought of asking him over for dinner! The only thing I wish he would have talked about was how he reacted to booking decisions and what went through his mind when he won the world title. Definitely worth the money, and I'm glad I ordered early!"
5,"I've got a new found respect for the man they call ""Foley""","This book is everything that the hype says it is and more. Apparently, those shots to the head didn't hurt Mick Foley's ability to hammer out one damn great book! To sum it up- the MAN can write!"
3,Blast are a little too short,"My kids enjoy these blasts, but they only last 90 seconds and then you have to wait for the next one to load, even if you choose the play all option. I thought they would be simultaneous so the kids could do as many as they want without stopping, but there aren't. The pause isn't that long, but it is just enough to make the kids think it is over and that they can stop until they learn the drill. I do like the instructor and the great messages she gives the kids while they are working out. She tells them the importance of staying active and how they need to be a role model for others, she is great."
2,Poor Compatibility on a Nice Looking Product,"I purchased this because I'm getting a computer with only 1 USB port, unfortunately by not reading enough into it, they LITERALLY mean that it is a printer port, it does not work with CD drivers or other parallel equipment, the Serial port DID NOT work with my Wacom Graphics Tablet, the device was useless to me, and returned."
3,Little Dry for my Tastes,"I purchased this book to prepare for a trip which included visits to several Mayan sites in the Yucatan. Generally, some historical reading adds to my enjoyment of the sites we visit. Unfortunately (and this is a purely personal judgment) I found this book exceedingly dry. It was very hard to read and I would put it down after just a few pages. I did not get all the way through the book before our trip. It seemed to have a plethora of useful information, but just presented in a very mundane way. It may be your cup of tea, but I'll look for something different next time!"
5,This is possibly the most informative book I have ever read.,Shannon Miller: America's Most Decorated Gymnast:A Biography easily surpasses what any ordinary biography would tell and spans almost a decade of the life of the greatest gymnast there ever will be.
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun","This is a great CD for those summer road trips. Wendy James doesn't have the greatest voice and the band's a little sloppy but it feels like that's how it's supposed to be. This band has been panned by critics forever but if you're a fan of fun, loud rock 'n' roll, this will do it for ya."
1,Not as advertised,"I am a fan of the ""4 Film Favorites"" collections and own several of them, but the Western Collection was very disappointing. Despite what the packaging says, Maverick is a full screen version. This killed the deal for me, since I only buy widescreen. The only other movie in the set I was interested in was Wild Wild West, so this set made no sense for me. For someone who finds full screen acceptable or is happy with the other 3 movies, it could be a viable purchase.Incidentally, trying to convince Target employees to issue a cash refund on an opened DVD, even one that was misrepresented, is no easy task!"
5,"Berta Rojas, my new favourite guitarist.","I love the product , I love Berta Rojas, I love Agustin Barrios , Don't tell my wife, she will be furious."
2,Annoying supporting characters,"This book would have been good if not for the portrayal of the some of the supporting characters here who are almost always present so there's really no avoiding them.Jihra's consent to the plan to sacrifice her sister is off-putting and frankly, unrealistic. Most importantly though, I found Davyn to be particularly annoying due to his self-righteous and priggish attitude especially towards Icefire. While a little jealousy and hostility from him might be credible, this character is so judgmental that it completely turned me off the book and the series as a whole (a pity I already bought the whole trilogy)."
2,Quality poetry from a spurious source,"I've read some of Dana Shuster's works and found them moving and with a real air of authenticity. Like many, I was shocked to discover that Dana Shuster had actually never been in Vietnam and that no record existed of her ever having served. Reportedly she's confessed and is in therapy. That leaves me with mixed feelings; obviously she has talent, because how else could she convince so many people? But her talent will be forever tainted by the deception, which is too bad."
1,A Shameful Book of Lies,"Dana, aka: ""Dusty"", was never in the Army Nurse Corps, was never in Vietnam, and was never even a nurse !It is beyond belief that she is profiting by her lies with this fraudulent book. How can she even pretend to know what actual Vietnam nurses suffered through, and still suffer with to this day?If I could, I'd give her zero stars.You see, I AM a Vietnam Veteran, and was in the Army Nurse Corps. I volunteered for two tours in Vietnam. Dana, with her fraud, demeans all of us who DID serve.To read TRUE stories, I refer you to WOMEN IN VIETNAM by Ron Steinman."
4,Jolson in Mammy,"I am very glad to see a film this old has been restored. The Blackface is not offensive. It is a part of history. That was the way Minstrel Shows were that traveled around the country.I WAS disappointed that there were very few scenes of Jolson singing and dancing. He was the greatest entertainer of his time. But I think he sang ""I'm Happy"" at least 4 times and it was a very narrow view of what Jolson was really like and how he could capture audiences."
1,THIS MOVIE WAS A DOG!,"I love dogs, and don't remember any significant time in my life that I didn't have a dog, however this was the worst movie including dogs that has ever been produced. It started off sad enough with ""Pencil"" dying but the movie went downhill until the end without any redeeming quality. How anyone could genuinely want to see this movie more than once (and once is once too much) is beyond me. To actually spend $4.00 on a used DVD was too much. Don't waste your money or your time."
1,FOR THE DOGS,"With SNL Funny Lady Molly Shannon and Talladega Nights John C. Reilly you couldn't go wrong, right? WRONG!!!! The cast and even the director are actors I've liked (separately) in other movies but this just doesn't work. From the beginning I understood that it was going to be a dry comedy. There was plenty of DRY but NO COMEDY. I started to think that this was some kind of PETA or ALF propaganda film but when I saw the ending I realized it was quite the opposite, or at least the meaning I took away from it was. This is not anything like ""BEST IN SHOW"" which was printed on the box."
1,Film Glorifies Mental Illness,"Sadly this film glorifies animal hoarding and tries to make the mental illness that underlies these human tragedies look trivial. There are thousands and thousands of sane, healthy, hardworking animal rescuers in this country; but this film is NOT about them. Instead it is about those who lose their way, become isolated from people and harm themselves and the animals they love. This film tries to validate their insanity and make their lives look desirable. Hoarding is not funny. It is the most serious source of horrible cruelty for thousands of animals each year, and a tragedy for the people involved."
3,ok for a historical romance,"I'm surprised at the other reviews. I am usually much harder on books than other people. But, for a historical romance, I didn't think it was that bad.It had things that all historical romance novels have that I don't like (which is why I rarely read them): the 17 year old virgin with no experience in life, the older man who has slept with everyone, and of course impossible situations -- pirates, harems, etc.But, I thought it was well written and I liked the characters as they were developed. If you are a historical romance fan, this is still a good book."
4,"Hopefully, first of many from the Beach Boys archives!","Wow, it's 75 degrees in the midwest, summer is near, and we have new (at least newly released) Beach Boys music. Recorded on one of their most acclaimed tours in 1980, and with the participation of all the original Boys + Bruce Johnston, this is a hidden gem. The guys are in great voice, clearly engaged and fired-up, and the set-list still had a few surprises. Also most interesting is hearing the on-stage banter, especially from a clearly fired-up (and raspy!) Dennis Wilson. There are supposedly hundreds of recorded concerts in the vaults, and lets hope they keep 'em coming!"
5,"Ingenious game format and fun, too","This series of hangman games is great fun. While it can be played without additional players, it can be adapted so that players can take turns. I use these books with my students and they are always ready to play it. It is useful for reinforcing spelling patterns, vocabulary and deductive reasoning."
1,Not worth the money!!,"I just got this for Christmas and was really disappointed! My husband had read all of the positive reviews but we were so shocked when we watched it! It seems as though all of the ""worst"" auditions were from Season 4 and most of the best performances I have no clue why they picked that particular song for that contestant!Maybe it was just us, but I personally don't think it was worth the money and will probaubly never watch it again!"
1,Caution,"This was not the part that I thought I ordered. This is a heat riser tube that goes from the exhaust manifold to the Air cleaner. Amazon has is described as a air intake hose, which it is not. Unfortunately, It's not worth the expense of paying to ship it back, therefore I'll have to eat this one. Once again-It's labeled incorrectly."
5,Another reason why he's missed so much,"Heaven and Hull was completed just prior to Mick's death with the help and assistance of friends and colleagues who admired his brilliant play. Issued postumously, this album contains wonderful power chord rockers as well as sweet melody instrumentals. Don't Look Down, combines Mick at his rocking best with Joe Elliott's vocals to create one of the best straight ahead rockers ever recorded. Other collaberations, including songs with Chrissie Hynde and John Mellancamp show Mick's virsatility. Life's a River, with Mellancamp on vocals, is a great tune that shows just how good Mick's guitar playing was. It has been only since his passing that we've been able to see and more importantly hear this great music and other recently issued material. He is missed."
3,Cute Day Planner,"This is the perfect gift for a friend who is either interested in astrology or the person who has everything. It ties up with a beautiful little dainty ribbon, has entry lines for each day, though not a lot. I use it to enter in friends and family members birthdays. Each day has two or three famous persons born on that day listed beside it."
4,Urban Solitude,"I used to play this album a lot, but now there is the new album Urban Solitude. I think this album is much better, so I don't play the first album very often anymore. Y'all should get her new album. Her latest single R U kidding me is on it. I like the song with the other dutch band Kane the most. I'm going to a concert of Anouk in April. Can't Wait!"
4,Works fine,"This mortising chisel is slightly different than the set I purchased about 5 years ago. It looks like it is designed to better get rid of the shavings. Delta discontinued the 1/4"" bit so replacing broken bits in the future won't be possible through delta."
4,Does what it is supposed to do,"This is a sleek and handy little case. My Macbook fits in there snugly and the flap is held in place with two patches of velcro. The case doesn't add a lot of bulk to the computer, so I still have space in my bag for whatever else I need for the day. At the same time, it's protected from getting bumped and jostled all day as I do my thing around town.As a stand-alone case, this would be an inadequate product. There are no extra pockets (that is, no place to stash your power supply) and no handle or strap. It's not designed to be your exclusive walking-around bag, but to provide that crucial extra bit of protection. And that is its only function.My only complaint - and this is me being really picky - is with the velcro. Whenever I get out my computer in the library it makes this massive ripping noise that rends the air asunder. Whatever happened to buttons?"
4,"Great product, great price!","I purchased 3 of these and have used them for over a year. They are comfortable, medium thickness, and wear out normally."
2,Don't waste your time,"From the beginning I found the story line weak and a little confusing but I was determined to ""push"" though to the end. About of the way through the book the true story line was finally laid out. I found the idea that due to their generally accepted special psychological ties twins can ""transmit"" volumes of information to each other just too weak to enjoy. There is lots of blood and guts killing to raise the excitement, but all done by a woman who has never had any experience in field activities. We are asked to believe that at her father's knee she learned all the skills a first class terrorist ever needed ""just in case"" she ever needed them. A tribe of women warriors, a house wife that plans an attack on a fortified facility and kills dozens of terrorist, a student pilot flying a DC-3, mysterious voices communicating to the characters; it is just all too too hokey and disjointed for me.PS; If you are looking for insight into the CIA, this is NOT the book for you."
2,Disappointing,This DVD did not show the worst of the seasons and I was very disappointed that they didn't show the best of the worst.
5,The temptation...,"...is to try to be as imaginative and unusual as the book itself. However, it would take me a week and about fifty revisions, and I'm very sleepy. So:Kelly Link is really good. Read this book. Buy it first."
3,No way this book can be a 5 star book,"I bought this book, and her other book Magic for Beginners, based on the great reviews they have received and the fact that Gene Wolfe likes Kelly Link. However, the stories were not nearly as good as I expected besides Travels with the Snow Queen which is very good. You can tell that Ms. Link is a talented writer who has a lot of potential but this collection is just not that good. I will say that I read this collection while alternately reading Michael Swanwick's short story collection ""Tales of the Old Earth"" and I found Swanwick's collection vastly superior.Also, Peter Straub calls Kelly Link the next voice of horror. I find that ridiculous as most of these stories are not part of the horror genre. The fact that a story has a ghost in it does not make the story part of the horror genre. For me, the stories had too much humor in them to be considered ""horror""."
2,dorky,"Obviously a smart, hip author. But overall the novel was annoying, unsatisfying. Like reading a disturbed, precocious teenage girl's diary scrawl crossed with a dorky, untenable 'future war' scenario, laid out all artsy so it doesn't have to deal with anything to completion. Also, I found the poetic/indirect/romantic talk about sex particularly annoying--I wanted to know what happened. Felt the same about the eating stuff."
1,Say what?,"We had to read this book for school, and I must mention right away that I strongly disliked this book. I love reading, that's not the problem, but it's written very poorly, and the fact that they don't use proper symbols really got to me and they just use an irritating amount of capitals. The story itself was somewhat okay, but also odd. Summary: Immaturely written with poor imagination."
1,Only OK IF I am Generous,"The information on the war was vague and unrealistic. The incest was never dealt with, as was her unnamed bulimia. Dad was a jerk and that was never resolved. She is supposed to go off in the sunset with her English lover who just happens to be her shell shocked cousin at the end? YUK! However, the initial story, before the war starts, is sweet and almost innocent. If it were not for the fact she's doing her cousin while all the adults are utter fools."
1,If i could give this book zero stars i would,"My teacher at school reccomended this book to me. Its terrible, discusting and wrong. Parents, do not let your children read this book!"
5,Forever in my mind,"I picked up this book out of pure curiosity and I never imagined I'd be taken on such a beautiful ride. Daisy the main character is both relatable and at the same time completely unbelievable. But her spirit and the fight in her makes the book an amazing read. As for Edmond Daisy's cousin and ultimately the love of her life, the love he shows her which is unconditional holds them together through out all the tragedies in the story. That same love the share in that brief period together burns through the pages of the book making its way into your heart. No matter what your view is on the kind of life these kids are living and how this might be a little grown up for young adults you cant deny the beauty of this tragic yet magical love story."
2,flesh gordon dvd film,"the shipping was fast,and item was brand new,but the dvd regional disc was not correct.i understand that the US falls under region 1...the dvd sent was region 2,which makes it virtually unplayable in most US dvd players,so...next time,please make sure..double check everything...."
5,Excellent,"Product was excellent. Forgot how stupid the video was. But, enjoyed it and it is now in my husband's collection."
2,Not as good as I remember.,When I was 18 watching topless woman was all I needed to Like a sex comedy.Now 30 years later this movie didn't hold up so well.The comedy is not that funny as well.
3,Audio Commentary Makes the Difference,"In my earlier review I stated that it was a close call between the DVD and the VHS version of this movie. At that time, I hadn't found the director's audio commentary. It is mentioned on the case but is not listed in the disk's menu. It is on the disk, though, and can be turned on using the player's ""audio"" control. Howard Ziehm's commentary doesn't track the action in the movie or run half the length of the movie, but it is an amusing and informative account of what went into making this cult classic. That, plus the additional footage and the marginally better video and sound, makes the DVD a clear winner over the VHS version, in my opinion."
2,Flesh Gordon,"I enjoyed this movie. I orginially saw this move 30 years ago and it brought back some good memories from the seventies. I wouldn't really call it a porn movie. It's more of a movie with adult humor. I'd give it an ""R"" rating compared to some of the stuff that is available today."
1,MovieMars DVD will not work,"MovieMars DVD will not work and indicated ""Region Error""I am VERY disappointed in this order not only in the fact it does not work, was delayed but in your explanations of all of it. You technical explanation implicates the buyer must know what they are ordering. The expectation of a DVD is for it to simply play. The dvd player is standard not blue ray. I do not know or care what region it is set up for or any other technical information you listed below.Bottom line is that I must now return the faulty item at my expense. I will NOT be returning the item but throwing in the trash as the valuation is not worth further effort. This is not the way to do business and I am NOT planning to do any further business with your company"
1,Waste of money and time,"Cheap. Stupid. Hokey and not very erotic or interesting. A big waste of money! I saw the movie in a theater in an upscale neighborhood in the early 1970s when X-rated films were still shown in normal theaters. I thought it was one of the most erotic movies I'd seen. Hadn't seen that many to that point. So when I got a gift certificate to BN, I bought the DVD, among other things. It came and I was VERY disappointed. I guess I'd forgotten how bad it was. Extremely bad acting, even by X-movie standards. (Well, maybe not, but ...). Extremely bad 'effects' -- among the worst you'll ever seen anywhere. No beginning film-maker would be caught dead doing such silly models and animations nowadays. It might be a 'classic' in somebody's book. If so, it is a terrific argument for trashing and forgetting such 'classics' forever. Embarrassing. In a word. I barely could sit through it. Kept hoping it would get interesting. Didn't"
1,Flush Flesh,"I would like to review this film, unfortunately i fell asleep midway through it of boredom! Buy the sequel for your dose of real camp fun."
1,FLASH GRUMBLE,"WHAT A WASTE OF FIM! TOO SNIDE FOR MY TASTE. MAYBE IT'D BEEN ENTERTAINING BACK IN THE 60'S, BUT TODAY IT'S ATTEMPT AT CAMP - OR KITSCH - IS JUST TOO THIN."
3,So... is it really widescreen or not?,"I find it strange that this movie is supposedly in ""widescreen,"" yet the aspect ratio for it as shown on the Amazon website is only that of 1.33:1, which is not a widescreen ratio. That is a standard screen (ie ""pan-and-scan"") ratio. I found that this same blooper occurred with the Robert Crumb DVD, ""Crumb."" So please, Amazon, get your story straight."
2,Plodding writing style and factual errors,"Hulsey manages to make a fascinating period of our history boring. His writing is plodding, and minor factual errors seem to have slipped through the editing process."
1,"Mr. Campbell, you must be kidding me","This cd is not only weak, but a joke. For those of you who enjoyed the remix of this song at the clubs, do not buy this album....it doesn't have the version you're looking for. Unless you suffer from a disease known as ""dancing fast to slow beats,"" I honestly don't see how one could dance to this song at a club.....it's never been played at a club to begin with."
4,Good support great breathability,Has ok support but the fabric is very breathable. Love it. Way better than the motherhood maternity ones I was wearing. No nipple chaffing since I started wearing these.
4,Great for around the house and sleep!,"This bra is incredibly comfortable so I ended up purchasing another. I currently wear an E cup so I was having trouble finding something that was comfortable and gave me a reasonable amount of support. I will say that being chesty, this is not the bra you would want to wear when you go out in public unless you are hiding yourself in a jacket. The support is okay enough to wear around the house and maybe with a big t-shirt, but this isn't the type of bra that you would want to wear with a tank top or try and go out in."
1,Doesn't work,"It didn't cost much, I realize, but still was expensive for an item that simply didn't work. Idea was to use it in Europe to plug in electrical appliances that are 120. But, no dice."
3,Misleading description - watch out!,"Contrary to the description, which merely says, ""international"" and ""foreign voltage"" this item, out of the box, is ONLY for European outlets that require the 2 small round prong plugs. Any other outlets (such as those in the UK) will require plug adapters.Beware! This is not not a universal transformer, at least not without additional purchases - to adapt from the 2-prong European to whatever outlets are in other countries.I have not tested this; I will be returning it today."
2,Strong on opinion; weak on historicity,Whether you will like Mr. Foster's work or not depends on the style of historical writing you enjoy. If you like writing in the style of Stephen Sears you will enjoy this book. If you like writing in the style of Joseph Marsh you probably will not. It all hinges on how much opinion you are willing to tolerate in and the degree of historicity you demand out of works of history.
2,good but...,"this is what I was looking for, but this is the v2 model instead of the v1. one of new things about it that it plays audible books, but it may not work with a mac or linux. as well ROCKBOX will not work with it. if u r into rockbox stay clear until thy support this player. Don't get me wrong this is a good player, but if you have trouble seeing it then just wait!!"
3,Had some problems,"I had a few problems with this mp3 player. It would not turn off at times, and sometime not even turn on."
4,Great Player for the Price,This is a great little mp3 player for the price. Sandisk did a good job on this little guy. 2GB player that plays music and videos and under 100 dollars you can't beat that. It works great with no problems for me. Battery life is very good also. The only cons are that when an micro sd card is inserted it takes like 30 secs to load. Otherwise great unit at a great price and amazon was awesome in shipping as usual.
4,Fast and accurate,Received this very quickly. I would have liked to have an instruction book with it but the unit works like a champ. I would use this seller again.
3,Sansa MP3 player,"This player has many useful features including storage of video, image and music files as well as a FM tuner. Easy to use and sleek image."
4,Sansa e250,"The mp3 is great, however it does not allow all types of photos to be loaded onto it. Also, the users' manual is not very helpful on how to delete the demo photos on the deivce. overall, its good for music not so great for pictures and videos."
2,Disappointed,"The on-screen labels and menus are in a foreign language that is neither english nor spanish. Useless to me. The instruction manual is supposed to be available on-line in Acrobat PDF form. I have the latest Acrobat version (8.0), but nothing I do will bring up the instruction manual! Given the above, this player was a waste of money for me. Also, the available Rhapsody music organizer is priced at more than I pay for my internet access! I get the bad feeling that I cannot get the instruction manual unless I subscribe to Rhapsody."
2,Look for something else.,"This Sansa product Is like alcohol. Its okay at first, but it just sucks in the end. Its awkward to use and the software interface is too complicated and drawn out. Not flexible. You want something like this to be super easy to use. Customizable to an extent, and easy to access everything with only a few clicks, not 20 clicks."
4,Great Player with great price,I have the 2GB player and am very satisfied. Previously owned Creative Zen that I enjoyed but does not stand up to travel. The thumb wheels broke. With the Scan Disk the sound is good. Pictures are very sharp. Have not tried the video. The thumb wheel takes some getting use to but works well.Can't beat the capabilities for the price.
3,Great features.......?,"I got his as a birthday present and loved it's capabilities for a long time. Sound wasn't bad and it had LOTS of features. Then, about one and a half months later, the top of the screen got lots of dead pixels. I figured oh well, I really only use it for music anyway, but then another month and a half after that, the screen became almost all dead pixels and was nearly impossible to see. I have since gotten an 8gb Zen and it works like a charm."
4,Good MP3 Player,"This is a really good MP3 player. It was just what I expected when I opened it up. The reason why I rated it a 4 star product was because when I tried to rename the recordings I made, the names ended up permanentaly into the songs list even though they aren't ""songs"". No matter what I tried I can't get them out. It would be fine but it messes up the whole list order. You click on one song near the end and it ends up going to the top of the list and playing the first song instead. Now I have to go under ""Artist"" and choose the songs that way. Another reason I rated it a 4 star was that when I put the MP3 player in my pocket, I lightly brushed against the table and the screen cracked. It was a very light brush and wasn't a drop or a hard knock. Besides those thing this MP3 player is perfect. P.S. Buy a holding case for this because the pouch that it comes with does apsolutely nothing."
2,Adequate for MP3 Audio ... Worthless With Photos,"Please understand, I've had good results with other Sandisk Products.However, this MP3 player is terrible.Admittedly, it will load and play simple MP3 audio files very well.But, to load or view any photo/video file requires the (enclosed) 'Sansa Media Converter' software. This software is worthless. Even after numerous sessions with Sandisk's technical support I am unable to load or view even a small photo (JPG or BMP). I only paid $109.00 for this product. I guess you get what you pay for. Sandisk is marketing an inferior product with this MP3 player."
1,Piece of GARBAGE!!,"This piece of garbage worked for exactly two hours, completely froze up, and then would no longer even power up! Will NEVER buy another product made by SanDisk again!"
2,"Nice features, but....","I liked the looks, size, and price of the Sansa E250, but it definitely has it's downsides; ones bad enough that I returned it after two days.-Volume control:With my earbuds, I had the choice of really loud and deafening. This is a huge con for me as I listen to my MP3 at work where I need to talk to the people around me at the same time.-Windows Vista:The Sansa will not work with Vista, bottom line. Even with a new driver it would sit there and try to load over and over again without ever accomplishing anything. I was forced to upload my music from my new computer to my old one with XP to get anything to load onto the player.-Minor stuff:The control wheel was a little strange. It was easy to go past what you wanted to select, but I could overlook this with the reasonable price of the player.Bottom Line - If you want a decent, reasonbly priced MP3 player that will load your music and videos easily and not deafen you when you listen to them, don't but the Sansa E250."
5,Aces!!!!,Use for running and working out. Good size enough memory so I never get tierd of hearing the same song over.Volume contol is different fom what I'm used to. I guess all the Ipods have the same wheel type control too.It comes w/ about 20 songs that S-@%^*K!! so earase them right away using windows explorer or you'll be like me hunting them down after you've already put 200 songs in.I haven't used the video or picture option yet.Great product.
5,Very happy with my new MP-3 player,"As there are many music players on the market, it is hard to say if I made the best choice. I do know I am very happy with this little player. Bought 2 at same time. (One for me and one for the wife.) Figured I would shorten the learning curve by buying her the same device.It works great, it sounds great and is easy to operate. Am amazed by how long the charge lasts. (Have not measured the time, but weeks)Instruction were easy. Software works great and is fairly intuitive.Great value for sure! Only dissapointment was the radio. Does not come in as well as my other portable. True, for its size it works great. The FM was just a bonus, really. In all I love this thing and have no regrets."
4,No complaints yet,"For the price, quite a good machine. Good sound. PC-synch is great: no driver, just drag and drop in Windows Explorer. Screen is so-so, with obvious banding/shimmering of horizontal lines (not top-of-line LCD) -yet still bright and colorful. Some people might not notice."
3,Okayish :0,"I got this for about $165 last year for my graduation gift.Well... so I've been using this player for 8 months and I'm done.At first, I really liked the design, the blue click wheeland it's large screen. But honestly, if you get it, it's kindacheap-looking and people around me thought this is sortaIPOD copying one of the cheap mp3 players.Well and they've got this cheap earphones...And it really doesn't support many languages...which was a drawback for me since I listen to many Korean songs.Sometimes the player froze out of nowhere so suddenly...and it stays like that for ever until battery runs outand mine is broke now... screws are unscrewed...Hmmm... what should I say...for $105 is a decent player I guessbut I'm buying SAMSUNG'S YP-K5...with built in speakerit's totally cool the design is... is... just lovely... you just gotta check that outthe audio quality is much betterif you want to follow the trend, this is outI regretted not buying IPod instead of this :("
1,Doesn't work!!!,I had to return the first one because it didn't work at all. The replacement died on me after a few months of use. I'm not happy with this product at all and don't really want to purchase another sansa.
2,The Little Player that Stopped,"This is a good device overall, unfortunately it isn't the most stable and became nothing more than a blue flashlight at right about the 1 year mark.[...]"
3,"didn't have anything with it, no cords adapter manual etc.","I was pretty disappointed with this product. It arrived in a box all by itself, with no power adapter cord or manual. You also have to use it's proprietary converter much like the ipod issue. Will not do this again. I had to hunt for awhile online before finding a driver AND to find the manual."
1,Not a very sturdy unit,"I bought this as a gift for my wife in March of this year. It functioned well until now. The player was never banged around or exposed to excess heat, but the display sreen suddenly went wonky. It displays nothing but a frozen piece of abstract art on the screen, and nothing I have done will fix it. Now I understand why most people buy iPods; they're worth a little bit of extra money. And that is exactly what I'm going to purchase as soon as this review is finished."
2,Features Great - Performance Poor,"I've had this player for 4 hours, in that time I've had to remove the back of the device in as many times to remove the battery in order to reset the player. The device locks up with no display, no sound no nothing but a constantly lit navigation ring. Device BIOS is same as on SanDisk's website. Direction in user manual state to ""press and hold the menu button for 15 seconds to reset the system""BZZZZZTTT Thanks for playing! That doens't work either.Too bad, I really like the overall look, feel and features for the price."
2,Not Worth It Even With The Discounts,"I usually don't write reviews, but I have to for this one. Looking at the other reviews for the e250 product, they made it sound real good, and there was the ~$90.00 discount; thats why i bought one. Mistake. When I got it, the picture quality and sound was perfect. At first, I thought the only con to this product was that you have to plug it to a computer to recharge it, but it was no biggie. But after I used it for 2 HOURS and I shut it off and was about to turn it back on, it didn't work. I looked at forums here and there, and many people with this mp3 also had the same problem. Some gave solutions, but even thought I tried them all, it still didn't work. In the end, I had to replace it, just like many others with this mp3 did.The only good thing is the picture and sound quality; I'll give you that, but what use is it when it doesn't work? Not worth the $110.00. I give you my word that it will break in a year if not sooner."
4,Good Product,"I bought this unit from Amazon a few weeks ago. It is my first MP3 player --- basically an experiment of mine to see what these gizmos are all about. The unit seems solid, well finished, and it works exactly as promised. The tiny screen is extremely clear and vibrant in its colors. And the unit was not expensive at all!I have actually never had a good experience with an Apple product, so before I handed Steve Jobs hundreds of my bucks for a nano or iPod, I wanted to make sure it was something I would actually use. Now, with my Sansa, I see no reason to buy anything else, it does the job right.The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the ear-buds are uncomfortable and cheapish, so I'll have to find better ones."
1,Amazon= Junk,I will never buy from Amazon again.I will never buy a San Disc product again.The both sold me a junky defective product that is not really working the way it should and I have an almost impossible task in trying to resolve the problem. Just take my lumps and never do business with either ever again.
1,piece of junk,"buttons hard to use.won't download multiple albums by the same artist half the time and the player on the computer will read that it is on the sansa.very frustrating since mp3 players are supposed to be pretty easy to use. well after 4 hours, i've had it and am returning it.utterly not worth it."
5,Great product,"Nice design, great functionality. Ignore concerns about the menu wheel. Coudln't ask for anything more."
5,My new SanDisk e250,I love my mp3. I have tried others but this one is fantastic. Highly recommended.
3,Good Basic Media Player,"This MP3 player by Sandisk works fine. I have had no trouble with either the media converter software nor the player controls. The sound is good and the construction of the unit is solid. Beware that although this model is equipped with a micro sd card slot, it does not support any sd card above 2mb. I found this out the hard way as it is NOT written anywhere in the user info nor is this info on Sandisk's website. I found out through customer service after buying a 6mb card that would not work."
4,"Good MP3 Player, works well with Linux","Music works well with Linux - Grip or similar to rip .wav files off your CDs and convert them to .mp3; and just use regular file copies (bash or Nautilus) to move or remove files on MP3 player.Voice recording is also good. Creates .wav files with date in name, easy to transfer off MP3 player to Linux.FM player is fine.No documented method to put pictures or video on to player except included Windows ""Media Converter"" application. The JPEG pictures apparently need some specific format - a regular JPEG file does not work. I do not intend to use this for pictures or video, but I would add one more star if these were documented for use in Linux.The CD also includes a Windows only application for access to the Rhapsody online music store. According to the Rhapsody web site, Mac and Linux users can use the Rhapsody service via browser."
4,great but one problem,"loks, sounds, feels great - buy the griffin ear thumps, an expansion mcro sd card and you are ready to go - the only problem i had was the refresh database problem each time i turn it on (takes 3 minutes to reboot) but I fixed that by downloading additional firmware - this was a great refurb buy at $40"
4,Mostly well liked,I have found this MP3 player to be everything I expected except for the earpieces. They are a little too large to be comfortable for long periods of time.
3,Some problems,"The reson i gave this only a 3 is because mine wont let me put any pictures or videos on it, im not sure why. But everything else works great it holds all mu music plus i can record radio stations and voice. A plus over iPods. Does anyone have advice as to how i can get pictures or vidoes on it?"
2,It Would Be Fun...If It Worked,"I was expecting this to be like the classic 8 Ball of days gone by, or even like the current 8 Ball available on Amazon. The idea is there but the application is lacking. You have to shake and shake, then maneuver the ball around so the cube can display its message. Not fun at all. Plain and Simple? It doesn't work."
2,Sarcastic review,The 8 yr old who got this gift found it difficult to read the responses through the ball's dark color. Limited responses - not that clever. The young man tired of it within a few minutes.
2,"Sarcastic, but not funny.","We bought it as a gag gift. If you think ""Whatever"" is a reasonable/funny response to a question then this product is for you. Of all the gag gifts given on Christmas (6), this one was the worst."
1,This toy was great...and I'm the Pope!,"I really wanted this to be a great toy. My daughter loves sarcasm and would've enjoyed a working sarcasm ball. However, we couldn't even take it out of the box because it leaks! Not cool!!! This item will be returned! I noticed the item is no longer available--glad they took it off the shelf. Hope it stays off until they can produce a better one!BTW--the Freud Therapy ball had no problems."
4,Great gag gift; few negatives,"Bought it for a gag gift for a coworker. Worked out beautifully.Pros:1. Fun2. Exactly as described3. witty answersCons:1. Hard to see the answers sometimes (have to retilt or shake)2. build quality isn't the top notch, but as long as you don't throw it at someone's face, it should stay intact."
2,Slightly disappointed,"Great idea for a toy and I bought it as a gift. I'm a little disappointed in the quality. To read the answer on the bottom, you have to do a great deal of shaking and jostling to get the answer to appear. The answer cube inside doesn't line up with the window well. It often lands on an edge."
3,Ehh... Ok,"It's basically a magic 8 ball with a different dice.... and the phrases aren't all that great. So it's not really what I was thinking, but it works I guess."
3,American Idol VS Kelly Clarkson,I'm going to make this short. I don't care to see ALL the stuff from American Idol. I'm waiting for them to make a DVD of all the performances from Kelly Clarkson. Don't know if that will happen. But I'm waiting.
1,Eh...,I was looking for someone inparticular who was on season 4 but it was just the winners. I wanted the tryouts. Not your fault...mine....
2,moves way to fast,This motor is sturdy yet it moves way too fast for a disco ball and makes you feel rather dizzy.
5,children's cello Steven Isserlis nad Stephen Houg,This is a very beautiful and lyrical CD !Most people have never heard of Amy Beach .Frank Bridge or George Dyson so this cd is illuminating in its lyricism .Also this CD showcases the most melodic piece Sibelius ever wrote :the Lulu waltz.The notes are funny and strange and give Stephen Isserlis and Stephen Hough a presence of friendship and wit.This is an amazing cd .Like Bach- it is eternal music for children and adultsAnd Stephen Isserlis is a great cellist .
5,If You don't believe in fairies? After this book you will.,I loved that book and I bet U will 2!!!!!!!!!!
1,so bad there is no redeeming humor whatsoever,"My kids and I watched this in the evening, homework being finished. It was so bas we laughed, but mostly it was background noise.This is late 70's Italian scifi, and it looks as cheap and stupid as you might imagine.A captain, who doesn't like smart machines, discovers a really bad one on a planet whose population has been reduced to a primitive state in caves. They decide to help these aliens. Guess what happens!"
2,Very amateur stuff,"What can I say? It's certainly not the best of Glass music but it's a very interesting piece. And it suits well that genre. But overall I'm very disappointed. First of all, it's only 24 minutes long. It's a bit pricey for what we got. $9.99 would be an appropriate price. The quality of the images is simply not there at all. It's very poor quality. The editing is not that bad and the encoding is awful. Unless you're a real fan of Glass or you're interested by that subject, my advice is to avoid it or wait 'til the price drops."
5,Useful book on teaching values to kids,This is very useful for parents of young children who are introducing concepts of spirituality and values to their kids. I am using it as a reference for the children's class I'm teaching to 5-9 year olds. It would be useful for any age children. It could be a great conversation starter for the older kids/teens.
5,Tiny is Amazing,"As a piano player working in the Reno N.V. area ia the early 90's I had numerous occassions to hear Big Tiny Little perform live. Usually there would any number of other players ( usually keyboard) sitting there in the audience listening to this man doing things on a piano ( and left hand bass ) that most of us just dreamed about doing. I was always amazed at how someone so big, with such huge hands could move that fast. Having listened to the album, it brings back memories of just how good Tiny really is......it's a great album!!!"
2,Disappointed...,"I was very disappointed with this cd. I liked the beat and I liked the sounds of the music. What I didn't like is the sound of some guy's voice talking during each of the songs. I realize some people need encouragements like, ""That's it - push harder, now slow down, don't forget to breath, etc."", but I found it a major DIStraction and therefore, a major turn-off. Thanks, but no thanks."
1,There is nothing funny that comes out of this,"I have great sense of humor and love all kinds of comedy, stand up and Movies. This show was a complete waist of time, I am sure she was possiblygood in the 90's but now she is far from being a comedian. She is more of a gossiper in hopes by belittling everyone else orbragging it will make her an idol and possibly funny. _FAIL_"
5,Globe Trekker France,This movie is great for the classroom. very interesting for students and informative tour guides. Things kids would like to know and not just a boring tour of the country. It covers all over France except for Paris. Is a bit heavy on the wine and champagne tasting but cheese and escargot information makes up for it.
3,"""Get By"" part two","""I Try"", the first single off Talib Kweli's latest album, ""The Beautiful Struggle"" sounds like it could very well be the sequel to ""Get By"", Kweli's classic single from 2002. Both songs are produced by Kanye West, and he churns out a very similar piano-loop beat for ""I Try"" to the one he made for ""Get By"". Mary J. Blige's hook in ""I Try"" is a bit unnecessary, but Kweli's lyrics that brought him so much respect in the underground are helping him get noticed in the mainstream, and he kicks some nice rhymes on ""I Try"". Overall, a good single, but it could've been more different from ""Get By"", Kanye's beat does no justice for ""I Try""."
4,Cuts good but conduit is still there?,"A couple of turns and the cutting wheel has cut through the flex like butter. However either I am doing something wrong or there is more to this gadget. With the metal rings cleanly cut through, I can't separate the windings of the conduit. I think the problem is me, as the cutter seems to be doing exactly what it's supposed to do."
1,a little more info would be helpful,"This is not really a review of this product but instead it is of Amazon. A product like this is not usually replacing a stock item. There fore, it would be helpful to know the gal. per hour, and the fuel line output pressure. I believe this fits a 3/8 gas line, but that would be nice to know also even though that is likely the least necessary information, There are 5/18 and 1/4 inch gas lines as well. Doesn't Amazon have any one knowledgeable in automotive? I am not just referring to this pump but the others listed on Amazon also. None have any relevant details."
5,Wash your hands and chow down!,"I don't really have much to say because as soon as the package arrived and we unwrapped it we made short order of the contents! Seriously, though, we ordered this product because the variety of 3 different tastes whetted our appetite and the price plus shipping was very reasonable. We still carry the memories from the 1980s when a friend visited Alaska and sent us a similar product and once we opened the package and tasted it, there was no going back. We finished a large fillet of Alaskan smoked salmon in minutes! We did the same with this product and it became difficult to select a favorite taste as all three were mouth watering. We recommend the product, the company and we are looking forward to receiving the next package in our subscription. Go ahead and order it and then enjoy it!"
3,just ok,"I guess I'm bias. I used to live and fish on the Columbia River and smoked what I couldn't eat or freeze. It's not the same in texture and the flavor is washed out. I'm searching online for the ""good stuff"", Anyone know where I could get the best?The native Americans should selling their killer stuff online, maybe."
1,poor quality,The sign looks like the picture but is made of thin cardboard and the size of a sign I could print out myself on the computer.
3,Ok,Guess I didnt read the description because I assumed the item would be metal like a stop sign but it is plastic.
2,good idea really bad execution,"When you pay somthing this much you expect it to be that good. The idea is good but...... Low battery life, poor file management system, lots of problems with USB connections, etc....I mean it still works in the end but very poor execution, way too overpriced... If it was stolen I don't think i would buy it again...but I am glad to have it now...Hope it means something to you... :)"
4,a historical survey,"Mollin has already written several texts on various aspects of cryptography. This book of necessity overlaps with those, to various extents. Here Mollin offers more of a general introduction and guide. Pitched to those outside the field. Whereas his other books are directed to students in cryptography. Hence, this is not a maths book, per se. The historical perspective is nice. Gives you an appreciation of what people did before computers transformed this field. Caesar ciphers, substitutions etc.But in the post WW2 era, high speed electronic computers made a wide impact. Mollin explains how this enabled public key cryptography. Based on the asymmetric effort needed to factor a very large number, compared to generating that number by multiplying a set of primes together.Mollin also looks at the future. Specifically at quantum computing. While early results are intriguing, it is still unclear if this approach will ever prove practical."
3,Easy overview.,"This book was an easy and quick read. It is really only intended as an overview of LWW and Lewis and the debate between ""good"" fiction/fantasy and ""bad"". For the Christian who is interested in this issue or somone only casually familiar with C.S. Lewis or LWW it is a good read. If you are looking for more of an in-depth theological treatise...probably not for you."
5,Christmas present,Got this for my 4 year old niece and she loved it. She now wants the Dora mermaid doll. Good gift..
2,"If you waited for this, then you don't need it.","The guide has some good things in it, but if you have the exp. pack and had to wait for this guide then you probably know more about the game than the book tells. It's an ok guide, but I was left feeling as if I should have waited to buy it from a third party for about $2."
1,Very poor quality.,Daughter received this as a Christmas gift. She pulled it out of the little bag and started to flatten it out when it crumbled in her hands. Excellent customer service to get refund though and rep aplolgetic and stated would contact manufacturer about the problem.
1,An Asian Winds of War?,"A sweeping view of the Pacific theatre during World War II, but this work is no Winds of War. The book is too sweeping and lacks focus on individual events. The book offers the premise that Tojo was ""forced"" into the attack on Pearl harbor because of the oil embargo. In other words, we hanged an innocent man, and Tojo was not a war criminal. Although Japanese atrocities are presented, the book portrays the Japanese as not wanting war. A mediocre story built upon an absurdity."
4,couples devotion,"My fiancee and I have started this book--we are getting married next year. The devotions are short and easy to do in half an hour or less. Sometimes the suggestions are a bit obvious--but it's definitely a starting point for a conversation. Many of the passages use the AMP Bible translation, which I am not a huge fan of--but that's a personal preference."
2,An Editor's Nightmare,"The was a good book and easy to read, but I have never seen a published book with this many errors in it. They are on almost every page. Titles out of place, misspelled words, errors in punctution, etc. You name the error. This book has it. The content was fine (if a tad redundant), but the reader quickly gets annoyed. This book was rushed onto the shelf!!!"
4,Highly recommended.,"Unless you are a master, you should play open, tactical games--this book teaches openings which lead to such exciting chess. However, I did find that some of the analysis was behind in theory, like in his recomendation against the Alekhine Four Pawns attack. This is a minor detail; all in all, for its size, a terrific openings book."
3,DRILL PRESS VISE CLAMP,"THE QUALITY OF THIS CLAMP IS VERY GOODIT IS A TOOL YOU SHOULD HAVE NEXT TO YOURDRILL PRESS, BUT IT WILL NOT BE APPLICABLE FOREVERY PROJECT. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE USE OF THISVISE ON YOUR WORK BENCH OR WELDING TABLE IF YOUDRILL SOME HOLES"
4,Superb account of one of the best albums of all time!,"A great little book that goes into the details of the making of the ominous LZ IV. Mr Godwin even goes into a treatise of the meanings of the ""four symbols"". Each track is broken down and recording methods are explained in laymen's terms. A great book for those who what ""behind the scene"" information!"
5,excellent,The product is in excellent listening condition and I was totally engrossed in everything that was said on the CD.
3,6 vhs,The VHS set of 6 has 10 episodes from season 1 and 2 from season 2. Good stuff though. Reccomend to anyone.
5,Excellent Family Viewing,I watch this with my almost 7 year old twin girls and it's great. Totally positive stuff. Teaches good values. Wish there could be more entertainment like this.
1,THUMBS DOWN,"This product is deceiving, it is bulky and a cheap piece of foam. Don't waste your hard earned $$$. I returned this product the minute I opened the box. I knew I had been taken. One month later I still have not seem a refund!"
5,great service,"Got just what i ordered and in an appropriate time frame, thanks.When i order i need to know the price, how long to get to me and as much info about the product as i can get."
5,perfect fit,These lens replacements fit perfect and they installed just as the original with the stock hardware. Great product and price.
1,Save your money...,"Device was difficult to obtain a reading with, strap broke within two weeks of purchase and Mio refused a warranty request. Overall, a waste of money. If you choose to purchase, do so with your eyes wide open."
1,Wow,"Just a bunch of talentless ""musicians"", and I use that term loosely, trying to cash in by ruining some Thin Lizzy classics. Stay far away from this atrocity."
5,Good Stuff,"I am from old school, and don't like many of the singers of today. This is a very good CD, with a one old school singer, and some of the better singers of today."
4,simple and helpful,"I rented this dvd and found it helpful. If you are taken Acupressure classes (Beginning to advanced);you would understand that it takes times to correlate the points and their uses.Therefore, you can add this to your book of knowledge.It is better to have something simple, yet understandable at the same time, as youcan add this to your book of learning/knowledge."
2,A long winded and unsatisfying ending to a trilogy,"This book lost its way following the two excellent parts of the trilogy.Over-plotted with twists all over. I felt the characters were become thinner and less real and less convincing. The Scarred invasion led by Danya is unconvincing as is its resolution, and Rhu'hee being brought to what turns out to be summary justice by Ryfor pinching Ian Draclas's boat seems worse than bolting the door after the horse has bolted. I read it to the end but wondered why I no longer cared what happened to the charachters. Except for Crispin's daughter who is certainly the most interesting in the last half of the book, but underdeveloped.A disappointing ending to two very enjoyable stories."
5,really good!,"The book itself was an awesome read - the service was great, mailed out even before promised, received in great condition. I will do this again."
4,Awsome finale!,"I enjoyed Holly's previous work, and Seven Fingered Fat Girl is still my favorite Lisle Character (From, ""Bones of the Past""), but ""The Secret Texts"" story is so much richer. The characters are fuller, the world is more complex. The villains in ""Courage of Falcons"" are as deep as any of the heros. Better, they aren't intelligent for two and a half novels, only to become suddenly stupid as book three reaches the last hundred or so pages. Many authors do a great job of creating tension. Not many can maintain it for long periods without it wearing on the reader. Holly Lisle does this better than anyone I can think of. The ending is wonderful, and leaves us wondering if this is really the end of this conflict."
5,Marvelous ending!,"This book continued where the last left off. Danya and Luercas have convinced the Scarred that they are the long prophesied messiahs that would lead them to victory over the humans. The Scarred did not care that their new leader, Luercas, was evil or that Danya was out for personal revenge. They became an unstoppable army and declared war on all humans!Kait and Ry were skinshifters. They, along with Ian, Dughall, and the Falcons, struggled against the immortal, soul-devouring necromancers known as the Dragons. Afterward, they must face the Scarred armies.***** This one is the best of the three! The author carries the reader along with the characters through hopeless situations. I flew through the pages swiftly to see what would happen next. Marvelous ending! *****"
3,Good I SPY book..more for older kids.,"My 4 year old loves I Spy books. We have the challenger and the school one. I got her this one for a trip. Oddly enough this one seems a bit harder than the other ones she has. Plus the pictures aren't near as bright. I'm assuming that is due to them wanting it to look antique or older, but it is hard to see on a lot of the pages. Not my favorite i Spy."
5,It really cools down!,"It is a great compound, thous it made my CPU about 8 and more degrees cooler with 1 drop! I recommend it..."
5,buy it,"It does what it needs to do! I've got good temperatures on my CPU coupled with an after market cooler. Be sure to read up and watch videos on how to apply correctly. Do NOT pack it on. All you need is a BB size drop in the middle. Regardless, don't hesitate, this is a good purchase, and a must of course."
3,Ok...not thrilled,"I have used better over the years so I was extremely surprised by all the recommendations toward this product.1) What I received in the mail was a single vial of thermal grease, in a syringe. No instructions, no packaging. So maybe that was a seller issue but to recive 0 documentation with it was a surprise.2) On their website, the instructions are very specific on how to apply depending on your cpu. However, for ridged or non-flat heatsinks, the painfully (no joke, over 12 pages) instructions become plain dumb (involving a credit card, razor and coffee filter). Look, I get where they were going but they don't have a sperate pdf for non-flat heatsinks if the new instructions boil down to ""fill the gaps"".Hopefully the actual product will be stellar over the long run but the everything including the installation has left a lot to be desired."
1,a lot of noise for as5 but it didn't impress,"i change my thermal compound in my GV-N670OC-2GD and with the stock i has max of 58C in far cry 3 and with this i have 72C insane, the prices was alot for a tIny thing that dont work like i thing it should, so i think i will never buy and AS5 thermal compound again for GPU and if it dont work for gpu for cpu will be the same"
5,Great Product,"El producto es excelente, se puede aplicar para varios equipos. Viene en una pegueña presentacion, muy facil de aplicar. La calidad es Excelente y mejora sustancialmente la temperatura del equipo."
5,Didn't even clean up the old paste. This paste dropped temperature by 7-10 celsius.,"I have an i5-2500k. My cooling system is pretty weak because I want it to be quiet. Before applying this paste, the idle temperature was about 45C. When I applied the paste I did not bother to clean the old paste. Even so, now my idle temperature is only 35-37."
4,Thermal Compound a Must for Wine Cooler Repair,"I replaced the peltier module in a Cuisinart wine cooler . The most important step is not only having the polarity correct, but, using the proper heat-sink material. Arctic Silver is fantastic and easy to apply to both sides of the peltier wafer. I highly recommend it. Amazon was quick with my order, and I would use them again."
5,"Arcic Silver, Great Stuff",A hobby builder recommended Arctic Silver to me a number of years ago. He used it in all of his gaming rigs. I have been using it ever since. It's the best heat transfer coupound that I have found. Make sure that you only use a portion the size of a grain of rice. That's the secret. Much easier to spread with a single edged razor blade before incerting on the mobo. Bill L
4,Works Great,"Its a tiny tube, but a little goes a long way. I have been using this stuff for years and never had a component fail due to thermal issues.The tube is small, so if you need to get into tight spaces, its just the right size!"
4,Solid Product,Works as advertised. Easy to administer and a solid product. My old thermal paste for my graphics card had worn out and this replacement worked great. Keeps my GPU at manageable temperature levels.
3,Excessive shipping packaging,"I haven't flown the kite yet, but I could not believe the huge box it was shipped in. The kite is long a skinny.. perfect for a tube or long rectangular box.. but it was shipped in a narrow 6 foot by 4 foot box! Talk about wasteful."
5,Precisely what I needed,"As an accent reduction specialist, I did not know where to begin with accents for a new career in voice acting for games. This is precisely what I need as a beginner and will use it as I progress. Thanks, Paul! The CDs are invaluable as are the online resources."
4,Three Kings!,"Dimitri + Jazzie B + Quentin Harris!While all mixes in this compilation are outstanding, this is all about Quentin Harris. He's at top form here. Just lovely. His track selection and mixing are ON FIRE. One track that especially stands out is Monique Bingham's ""You Can't Have New York."" Also, Solu Music's ""It Aint Love"" and Cordell McClary's ""Got 2 Love"" are sinfully deep and expertly produced.In fact, all tracks are sublime. Quentin has excellent taste, and makes incredibly wise and tasteful choices, he's just a natural, a star. What more can I say? Buy this ASAP!"
2,Beware of Durability!,"I purchased this beautiful pattern to replace my ten year old Mikasa UltraCeram for every day use, as I had grown tired of the Mikasa pattern. I have had the ""Braided Scroll"" for six months now, using it every day, and it has more chips than the Mikasa had in ten years of use. As pretty as this pattern is, it simply doesn't stand up to daily use in the dishwasher. In addition, because it is thicker than many patterns, it is difficult to load in even a newer dishwasher like mine. I purchased only five of the 12 place setting I eventually wanted, but will not be completing the set due to the durability issue."
2,Lack of info,You can't just click off the alarm like the other clock that I have. It was an enginering flaw that wasn't stated when I bought the clock. I talked to customer service without any satisfaction. The clock didn't automatically switch at daylight savings time.
4,"Necessary for safety, but a not perfect solution","I think this product is necessary to protect our daughter from falling from our too-wide balusters, but I have a few issues with it. The semiflexible nature of the material is probably required for decent installation, but it definitely makes it hard to work with. I would recommend two sets of hands for the job. The material is also quite loud when a kid pushes on it or hits it. However, I do think it is the best option out there right now for keeping your child safe from falls."
2,Look elsewhere,"I bought this hoping that it would look nicer than the nets that other stores have on the market. The plastic is really hard to work with, its very cumbersome, you have to punch holes into it to attach it to the railings, and the sheeting attracts dust and lint like you wouldn't believe. If you are dedicated, and will take the time needed to plan out how the guard will go up - you might be able to put this up so it looks decent. Otherwise, you probably want to look elsewhere."
3,Pretty good,"This product is pretty good , kitten cant climb it , hes not sure what to make of it... the down side if you dont have the proper cutting tool like i didnt its basicly going to be a crooked cut theres one area that is like that that my kitten can still get under ... the hole puncher that came with it broke after a while .... used a nail to make wholes where the puncher could not reach"
5,Memories of Selena,As mmentioned before I cannot get over the death of this star at such a young age and since that time I have bought all DVD's & CD's produced.This edition is vertually a album of all her sons and put together very well. I'm sure every fan of hers would love the edition.
4,Good camera for a novice (me),"I bought the Kodak 4800 after some quick reviews of other digital cameras in this price range. I supplemented the camera with the additonal battery pack and carrying case, and the battery charger is a lifesaver (although the case was worthless).The camera takes good pictures, has an easy-to-use features setting and the battery life is pretty good, although I felt more comfortable with a backup battery.The only thing I didn't like is the feel of the camera in my hand, although I eventually got use to it. I'd prefer something a little smaller, and the 4800 has some weird angles with the lens and buttons.Overall, it's been a great camera for a novice photographer."
4,VERY NICE CAMERA... FOR EXPERTS AND NON EXPERTS !!!,"I am an artist and need pictures taken all the time, everywhere, so I can reproduce them in my paintings... the camera is been so helpfull because I don't have to wait for developing films. I snap a shot and thats it. Beautiful pictures, colorfull, neat, full of light. The only thing is that the camera comes with a 16 mfc instead of a 128. The battery also gives you no more than 3 hrs of use. Except for that I think its a very good one. I would like to learn more about photography, speed, light, exposure etc, so in the future I will be able to manage it manually, which I think it is the best way to take perfect pictures."
2,Call the Vise Squad,"Does it work? Pretty well, unless you are wanting to bolt it down to the drill press it was made for. While you can twist it around to get a few bolts in, that is a compromise you shouldn't have to make. Delta screwed up royally on this! I don't own another (yet) to recommend, but if you have a choice - pass on this one."
5,Great starter set.,"My daughter was bringing these home from pre-school and enjoying them so I decided to purchase them to continue her reading practice over the summer holidays. I'm so glad I did. They are perfect for beginner readers. As one reviewer wrote, there is a lot of repetition but I find that is what my daughter needs to absorb the words. They are simple books which make her feel good about her reading. Definately recommended for beginner readers aged 4-5yrs."
2,Very disappointing ...,"I introduced Meet the Sight Words to my 2 and 4 year olds this past year. My oldest just turned 5 and is starting kindergarten next month. Meet the Sight Words has three levels each with a corresponding box of readers. My son has blazed thru all of his MTSW readers so I purchased these to give him some variety. I was really disappointed when I opened up the Scholastic readers and realized that they pale in comparison to MTSW. These books are nowhere near the same quality or level as those from Meet the Sight Words. The scholastic books are thin and flimsy. All of those that I have reviewed have only one sentence per page. One in particular entitled ""That Hat"" is eight pages long. Five of those pages have the exact same sentence on each page. There was much more thought put into the illustrations than the text. The text is very boring and not a challenge."
4,Wonder Pets Save the Reindeer and Lots of Non Christmas Animals,My son has watched this DVD countless times but I expected it to have at least a winter theme to the whole thing. I think there is a moose in Alaska in one of the other episodes but the other animals are random like a camel in the desert.
4,Audio recording,A friend of mine recommended these for burning audio cd's on the computer. He has burned over 200 cd's and says he has never had a problem. The only thing that has me stumped is the other Maxell blank cd-r's amazon has for much more money.
5,Wonderful!,These exquisite cards are a wonderful tool to tap into our true selves and simple miracles everyday. Inspirational! Beautiful! Thank you Sulamith Wolfing for your wisedom and your art.
4,Living as female Bostonians,"This novel is a quick read as Holly Chamberlin looks into the lives of a group of female friends living in Boston, living the single life. As reason and romance battle the mind of the main character, Erin, you live her life with almost an erie reality. The novel does not cover many topics, but always has something new intertwining within Erin's life. This novel includes everything from affairs with lovers to the psychological disorders emerged from family life as a child. It might be Holly Chamberlin's first novel, but it deserves a read, a few laughs, and a good reputation. I highly recommend diving into these girls lives when you just want to get away from yours!"
3,just okay,"I really wanted to love this book, but the story kind of dragged. We have 4 women who we really don't understand why they are ""long term"" friends. One is downright mean, and one is a ""no show"" for part of the book. The only characters worth reading about are Erin And Abby. I loved the start of each chapter where Erin gets a postcard from her Mom,and would have liked her to be introduced to the story in the end. Leave out 2 of the women and concentrate more on Erin and Abby. I also enjoyed reading about Boston. However, the ending fell quite flat."
3,Not really worth the time...,"I read the first page of this book in the bookstore, and thought ""wow, this seems really funny and well-written."" I was mostly wrong.While the plot-line is decent, and Ms. Chamberlin does cover the taboo topic of infidelity with sensitivity and compassion, the story just drags. There are about twenty dinners, lunches and happy hours too many. Entire characters could have been cut without doing any disservice to the story. The book is set in Boston, and (as a Bostonian) I found the restaurant name-dropping to be very distracting.If you are a fan of chick-lit, you will probably think (as I did) that this novel was ""just okay."" Unless you have unlimited reading time, you might want to focus on more worthwhile novels."
3,Not the same as picture,"Not drilled for jaw plates and retainer for moveable jaw is poor design, but for the money I paid I can make it into a better tool, after all I Have a drill press.........they moved the pin so it has more beef and it is not the same casting as in picture."
4,delta vise,"I bought this for the DELTA 17-959L 17-Inch Laser Crosshair Drill Press knowing it wasn't intended to work with it but I assumed that with some modifications it would. I cut/ground out the slot divider on the vise base so there is one long slot per side and then added some 1/2"" bolts and large wingnuts to clamp it to the drill press table. With these modifications it works fine with the listed press."
4,Iambic tetrameters the Nabokov way,"A bit too long and deep for it's misleading title, NOTES ON PROSODY remains influential in the continuing study of English and Russian poetry. Nabokov's ideas about ""scudded feet"" and ""tilts,"" while not adopted into the orthodoxy on scansion, are still read widely by the folks who study it, folks whose bibliographies led me to this little volume. It's worth a read, especially if one would like a witty, concise survey of the iambic tetrameter in English or a study of Pushkin's deployment of it in EUGENE ONEGIN.Those who arrive here as fans of VN's novels should steer instead towards SPEAK, MEMORY (his autobio) or LECTURES ON LITERATURE for their Nabokovian non-fiction. Imagine a joke written in French here. Happy hunting!"
2,Please - a good editor!?!,"Decent characters (if a bit predictable and trite by making them Lakota) good plot, decent writing but with foolish mistakes that stop the flow dead over and over. A coat turns into a cape mid-sentence; Sam is dealing blackjack in one book and ""knows nothing about gambling"" in the next, to mention just two out of so (so!) many. A good editor could clean these books up and the author would sell a lot more. Decent handling of the psychic with respect and insight. Such potential - please, get a good editor!"
2,Very disappointed. Expected more based on other reviews.,"After reading the reviews, I had high expectations for this series. I found the author's style very disjointed and unpleasant to read. There were far too many characters and far too little character development. The book would have been better if the author had focused on a few of the characters and worked on polishing them more."
5,DOWCO Ez Zip Motorcycle Cover,"I have 3 motorcycles, 1 BMW and 2 Harley Davidsons. 1 cruiser and 2 touring bikes. I have the same type DOWCO cover on all of them.Dowco's EZ Zip is made exceptionally well and is incredibly easy to put on and take off. For the $$ it's the best value for a motorcycle cover on the market.Good, solid, easy to use protection for motorcycle(s)."
2,Not a Great Buy!,I bought this tricycle for my daughter. She will be 2 in March. The design is super cute and I love to take her on walks around the neighborhood. I went to the toy store to purchase and tested the floor model. I would not buy the floor model because it felt woobly. I bought a new one and took it home and put together. My concerns are that the new one is super woobly (meaning the handle bars that i push her with). They feel like it will come loose. I have tried to tighten it and you can not tighten anything. My canopy is also crooked. I have tried several times to fix that.The bike is also very hard to turn. I have to really push down on it to turn a simple corner or just bare to the right a bit. I called to the store to see if I could return they said no. I called Huffy company and they can not help me either.I would have rather spent my $75.00 on another bike.
1,Stopped working after using only twice.,"This shredder worked great initially. Then, after using it only twice, it was completely dead when I put the switch on ""forward."" Reverse still worked fine. I tried waiting, uplugging it, even days later it was still dead. Returned to Amazon for a full refund."
4,Nice gallery frame set,"Linear Wood Frames 10-pc. Set - WalnutVery nice set, the colour is great. However, a couple of the frames in the set had a flaw."
3,"Creative, but falls short","A good collection of stories, running the gamut from the Berlin Airlift to a humorous story about a Warsaw Pact invasion of Europe. There aren't any apocalyptic nuclear war scenarios, and the Vietnam scenarios (of which there are only two) both reek of what the authors think should have been done, not what was really plausable. I would have enjoyed more in-depth scenarios, and a few that covered a simple Warsaw Pact invasion. All in all, what scenarios were covered were done rather simply, and skipped around, not covering Europe or nuclear warfare."
5,Love alternate history?,I love history. It is always fun to try to think what would have happend if things were just a little changed. In this book you can read short storys of a cold war turned hot. All almost took place. All are good reads.
3,An okay read,"I was looking forward to reading this book and once I got it I was a little disappointed. Some of the scenarios were entertaining and kept my interest while others were just plain boring. The scenario involving an Afghanistan-Soviet-Pakistan-India war was downright boring and uninteresting to read. The last scenario dealing with a NATO attack on the collapsing Soviet Empire was ridiculous. I found it hard to believe that by firing bottles of vodka at attacking Russian troops would have eventually defeated them. Overall it was an okay read, but nothing to get excited about."
5,One of the all time greats,"I've owned this book for many years and would notpart with it. It is still one of the greatmotivational books, along with ""How to win friendsand influence people""."
4,"Book Written In 1947, Still Relevant Today","Well written prose by Frank Bettger. His thoughts and ways to sell are still relevant today. They haven't fallen by the wayside. Go get this book, you won't be sorry."
4,Changed my life!,Simple words of great advice! Great use of your time!!! I would recommend this book to anyone in sales/marketing our running your own business. A must have!!!
4,Excellent book,"I picked up this book at my local library. I'm new to sales and I'm selling my company's services so I'm trying to read books on selling. I picked this book over others because it had so many 5 star ratings on Amazon. The first thing I noticed is that the book was written like many of Dale Carnegie's books. It has that homespun, positive message much like DC's books. I thought the content was excellent. There were so many great pieces of advice and so many great stories of persistence. Now the question becomes: Will it work for me? I think if I follow the principles in the book, I'll have some success. I also think this book will be one of the better books I'll read on selling. I can't imagine many other books giving that level of detail on how to be an effective salesperson. The best part was the book was free."
5,Begin your Sales Career Here...,"This classic from the 1940s covers all the basics of selling, starting with Chapter 1: Enthusiasm. Dale Carnegie (""How To Win Friends and Influence People"") wrote the preface, and Bettger's book is written so well I would not be surprised if Carnegie ghost-wrote the book. Frank Bettger earns our sympathy right off the bat, an average Joe doing average things. When his manager has him start to count his calls and other activity, things start to happen, just as they will in your career if you do the same. This book reads quick, and whether you are selling intangibles (securities, insurance) or tangibles (cars, real estate, etc.) you will benefit."
2,My experience with this phone.,I purchased this phone from cingular around 3 months ago. Just over the last week my phone has been freezing during calls. Last night it happend twice during one call and I had to turn my phone off then back on for anything on it to work again. The picture quality could be better and the flash works only if your with-in about a foot away from the camera. I hope to be replacing this phone soon with a different one. Next time before purchasing a phone I will read up on it more.
4,Good but probably for teenagers-very young adults,"I found little new there, but it is a decent book with nice design, but rather simplistic. If you read The Awe-Manac or Artist's Way, you don't need this one."
3,Written for a female target audience.,"I purchased this book as a gift for a male colleague as we are both art teachers. After receiving the book, I flipped through it to find some clever ideas. However, it should be noted that this book was created for a female target audience. For example, the book contains a template for 'turning yourself into a superhero' but the only template available is that of a woman. Other than that, I think it's a good book."
5,Love Love Love this book!,This is one of my all-time favorite books! I love Keri Smith's style and try to emulate her creativity. Wonderful book!
1,Wrong part was sent to me..,They sent me the wrong part so i wasn't very happy. Didn't fit my s10 truck so i had to go to the parts store and reorder one my self.
1,My camera fell out.,"When I put the case on my belt, my Stylus 400 camera kept falling out. In the end I lost the camera that way. Too bad I didn't think of getting a different case."
5,Essential Christmas Album,"I'm a music educator and choral director by profession, so I've heard a lot of Christmas music in my life. This album quickly made its way onto my ""short list"" of essential Christmas recordings, and has stayed there for many years. For my partner and me, each holiday season begin when we hear this album, and we grieve a little when it's time to put it away for the year. If you like Christmas music and the rich, full sound of a really top notch men's choir, you will love ""Beautiful Star."""
5,"Learn to draw, even if you can't draw","Many, many years ago, I took a class from the book's author, Dan O'Neill in San Francisco. I had always liked to draw since I was a kid, but I couldn't really draw comic strip type characters and objects. I also couldn't tell a credible story. Dan's class and book changed all that. It didn't turn me into a ""published"" comic artist, but for many years, I kept my co-workers and friends informed and entertained with my daily submissions.Eventually, what I learned became the basis for teaching each of my children how to draw. My daughter took it to heart and is currently a graphic design major at a liberal arts college in the Pacific Northwest.I don't know where Dan is now or what he's doing, but I wish him well and I'm pleased to see you can still buy this book."
1,Not the same as expected.,"The description of the e-document is not clear that even though it is the same title, that it isn't the same as the hard cover text.I had checked out the hard cover from my employer's library which I found interesting. I was under the impression that the e-document would be the same but it cleary was not. Didn't notice at first that the e-document was only 12 pages long as I had assumed it was the same document. Now I just paid $6.50 for an advertisement of the hard cover..."
3,"Overall durable, but some features lacking","This weather gauge does measure temperature and time accurately, however the weather forecaster is vague and we never know if the weather it is predicting is supposed to indicate the weather right now, later that day, or maybe even the next day. The unit suggests that the predictions are for 12 to 24 hours in advance, but this doesn't help very much when the weather is being volatile and we want exact predictions to prepare for weather that night or for the next morning. The weather forecast can also be extremely inaccurate, as the unit only has about five different weather settings and `partially cloudy' seems to cover anything from almost completely sunny to the verge of thunderstorms. On the plus side, the outdoor sensor has held up very well under heavy rain and the clock does an excellent job synchronizing itself."
5,Merry Christmas to ME!!,I previously had this CD and listened to is so much throughout the years it actually wore out. I was Very Glad to purchase this as a replacement.
5,Great Book!,"I found this book very helpful! It's easy to understand, and has a large variety of both exercises and practice drills. It's clearly written and not so long as to be daunting to get through."
5,Multi-Color Swarovski Crystal Bracelet,"My third purchase from Gem Avenue - my wife loved a Swarovski Crystal necklace/earing set I bought for Valentine's, so I picked this out for her. She loved it too from the second she opened the box. The crystals really sparkle and draw everyone's attention. She was comparing them to some colored CZs she has, and she said the crystals were more brilliant and eye-catching. I think for the price it's a good bet for nice costume jewelry piece."
5,Beautiful bracelet,I bought this as a present for my 20 year old niece. It is really nice - much more beautiful in person than the picture shows! She really loves it and the crystals just sparkle.
3,Over priced,"I just bought this game new for [...] how can they sell it for more than that. It still needs some work, the only ships you can work with are the O.H. Perry's. No CVN's, DDG's or CG's. So be careful, the game play is the same as Janed Fleet Command though, it take some real time playing to accomplish your goals."
4,"Good, but...","As a former navy submariner, I thought it would be fun to play the latest in sub games. The only problem was that this game is 7 years old and it shows. Some install / startup issues with Win 7 and display issues remain. One out of 20 games will lock up and not respond to the inputs. When it plays, it works ok, though the TMA controls are junk and worthless so the TMA solution is frequently off. Otherwise, it is a fun game and would be terrific it the developers would update the game with new drivers and fix the TMA issues."
1,MADE IN CHINA - SELLER TRIED TO CONCEAL THE FACT,"I unwrapped 3 of the 6 dishes I bought. All of them have residue from stickers that were removed from the outside, before the dishes were packed and sent to me. In one case, half the sticker remains. The remaining half of the sticker says the dish was made in China. Nothing in the item description on Amazon says ""made in China."" The seller's attempt to conceal the fact makes me suspicious that the dishes may not be safe for food use. There may be lead or other toxins in the glaze, or some other problem. (Remember the poisonous Chinese drywall after Hurricane Katrina? If not, Google it.) I think the law requires that country of origin be marked on the dishes, in addition. I intend to send them back. Shame on Amazon for carrying this product while pretending to have no responsibility for it!"
1,not helpful at all,"I was so excited when I got this book. I thought it would educate me on what I needed to do for my child. It basically lays out the IEP process and doesn't give any indications on how to fight for services, which we all know is what usually happens. Find another book."
5,Great Mother's Day Gift,I bought these for my mom this past mother's day and she loved them. I wish they had come in a nicer box but they came in a reasonable amount of time and are worth every penny in quality.
5,Great gift,My husband purchased these to match a necklace. They are lovely and arrived on time...made a terrific Christmas gift.
2,"Looks nice only, don't be fooled","Looked like a very nice pair of earrings online, but seemed plastic-like in nature once received. I was embarrassed to give them as a gift but it was too late to replace them."
3,Lovely...but,"These are beautifully designed; the Celtic knot is intriguing. The topaz is a very nice pale blue. However, the earrings lack substance....very light weight."
5,Beautiful!,"These earrings looked good in the photo, but are even better in person! Just beautiful -- strongly recommend these. They have plenty of silver, perfect proportion, lovely clear stones, and the silver work is very smooth. Perfect!"
5,Great earrings!,Beautiful earrings I gave as a gift. My friend loves them and I am happy I chose them as a gift. I recommend to all people who want to make a great gift!
5,fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunny,selten habe ich ein aehnlich gutes buch gelesen wie das diese
3,Needs to do better research,"Ms. Truman needs to do better research! Air Force women do not wear Khaki. And Air Force lawyers do not just take out helicopters for a spin. In fact, I can't think of any JAGs on flying status as pilots. And one more thing....most field grade officers do not reside in the BOQ, contrary to Margaret Truman's statement. Since our heroine lives in DC, she might, due to the cost of living in the area, but as a rule most single officers of that rank prefer to live off base. I found way too many inconsistancies to enjoy this book."
5,Great Buy!,This was a great deal!I really liked the cd and it's in excellent condition to my delight.
4,The Breaking of the Dawn,"I love Fernando Ortega's music and style. My only complaint would be that I thought I was getting christian music and some songs have a ""new age"" theme to them."
4,"great casual reading, not too intense","im just starting to get into world war 2 history, and it's quickly becoming a hobby of mine. this book is a whole lot of first hand accounts of what went on from 1939-1945. so far none that i've read have been more than a page or two which is a double-edged sword. some are very interesting and you wish they had more to say, while others aren't quite as interesting but they'll only take a few minutes to read. it's not just soldiers diaries, it's civilians, politicians, and of course the soldiers who were affected in some way by the war. this book is probably ideal bathroom reading for a person fascinated with ww2, you can open it up to any page and read a first hand account and be done in time to wipe (ok, had to toss in some crude humor there, my apologies). all in all it's quite worth the price if you like to read about this stuff. this book might spark your interest into researching other specific facets of the war."
4,Great for beginners,"Hi:-) This is a great book for beginners. It introduces MOO clearly and briefly. If you plan to MOO, the book is a good choice. Altough most of the examples are from Lingua MOO, they can be applied to other MOOs. It gives you a whole picture of MOO. YOu will find what MOO is, and what you can do in MOO. If you want to learn MOO programming, the book just provide you a beginning, and is not enough. Enjoy MOOing!"
1,Potentially Very Dangerous,"This is the story of a very arrogant doctor who quits his medical practice because of what his ""Inner Teacher"" told him. This could be a sign of psychosis. Nowhere in the books is the distinction between psychosis and psychic ever made. Perhaps Joy does not want his readers and potential students to know the difference."
3,Joy's way..not my way,this is my wife's book..It is his personal journey into self. Hard to get in to. The healing touch techniques he developed are valuable and is the only redeeming quality this book has.
4,Excellent Movie,"My 16 year old son is big fan of WWII history so he loved this movie. It was a good movie for the family to watch together, although younger kids would probably find it boring."
3,Great attention to detail,It's an OK movie. I liked the attention to detail paid in the weapons and uniforms; other than that not much meat to the story.
5,Cobalt blue dropper bottles,"These are hard to find. Couldn't settle for anything else. Thanks Amazon! As always, you've taken care of my needs."
4,More than just recipes,Purchased as a present for my mother and she loves it. Paula has included some cute stories in the book in which I read to my mom on Mother's day and she really enjoyed it.
4,It's a cookbook.,"So it's a cookbook, along with many others. It does have easily found common ingredients and the recipes are fairly easy to follow. Not a bad buy."
1,Watch out for peanut brittle recipe,"very bad Paula.Our microwave safe bowl of 12 years is melted to a pile.The mixture is as black as tarThe house is full of smokedirections say:4 minutes on high power,stir in nuts and salt4 more minutes on high powerat 2 minutes into the second round of cooking the micro filled with black smoke and the bowl melted.Furthermore the recipe called for and additional 1 1/2 minutes more of cook time.This recipe is absolutely wrong!!!!!!"
5,Delicious Recipes,"Paula Deen delivers in this book full of fantastic recipes. So far everything I have tried in this book has turned out great. I always get praises from the desserts I have made from this book. If you like to bake, I'd highly suggest purchasing this book. You won't be disappointed!"
1,A Good Example of Scholarly Hatred,"Rabbi Berger uses big words and a lot of paper to rehash a long-standing aversion to anything Chabad. It is a shining example of a scholar dressing personal feelings in academic language that, while impressive, is no more authentic than name calling."
1,Waste of time and money,David Berger needs to get a life. He attempts to smear the reputation of a Jewish outreach organization that has inspired millions of Jews from all walks of life to live a more meaningful and spiritual life. He is frustrated that no Jewish leader or organization is willing to take action against Chabad. Perhaps Mr. Berger should take a sabbatical from his prestigious position at the renown Brooklyn College and travel the world to see first hand the remarkable accomplishments of Chabad.
2,Fair review,"As I was looking at the reviews of this book contenplating if I should buy it or not, I couldn't help wondering why all the 25 ratings were either a 1 or a 5! What that meant to me or any thinking person is that every person who rated the book had an agenda pro or against the Chabad movement and the ratings lacked objectivity. I bought the book and here is an objective and brief opinion. For entertainment I give it a 4, Berger is a good writer. While there are some true facts in the book, there is no doubt that Berger goes way to far and exagerates. I have some contact with Chabad chasidim and in no way does Berger represent their views. So for a serious and honest academic, Berger does not give the reader an honest account."
1,Full of Hatred,"Can anyone please site the sources in Halacha or Gemara that he quotes. The entire book is inuendo and ""anonymous"" sources. That sort of writing does not make for ""Scholarly"" work. Usually you find this sort of quality in such exalted publicationas as ""The Enquirer"" and ""The Globe"" (You know, the one with the headline ""Man on dogfood diet bites Mailman!"")."
4,A forbearing and modest criticism,"Rabbi Berger has written a learned and humane polemic against the apotheosis of Menachem Schneerson. He explains why it is ridiculous and sacrilegious for Jews to acclaim a dead man as the Messiah in an unredeemed world. His arguments are clear and cogent, using the great Rabbinical texts, yet comprehensible to interested laypersons.Rabbi Berger has limited his criticism to those elements in Lubavitch who revere the dead Rebbe as the Messiah, or even worship him as God himself. The book is in no way a general attack on Lubavitch. The vitriol heaped on the author by some signifies nothing more than reactive hysteria.Those who are looking for a criticism of Lubavitch or the Ultra-Orthodox generally will not find it here."
1,Baachmann Trains Thomas with Annie and Clarabel,"This was a Christmas present to my son. He loves Thomas and I thought this would be a wonderful present to him. It turned out to be a nightmare. The train will not stay on the track. In addition, the tracks are not that easy to assemble. I followed the written instructions and I still had the same problem. My son didn't seem to mind the train falling off, but it mattered to me. This wasn't what I expected for the price. I thought he could have hours of fun running the train on the track. I am extremely dissapointed with how poorly this train set is constructed."
3,"Seller is Great, Toy is not.","The seller was useful, great, got the package the next day. The toy is not great, its plastic, the track pieces are not even, causing the train to fall off."
3,Thomas the Tank electric train,We decided to order the Thomas the Train electric train for our 16 month old grandson. He loves to watch trains of all kinds. He loves Thomas too. He has already learned how to run the train! It is simple and he is always supervised. He talks to Thomas as he goes around the track. The eyes on the engine move back and forth and he gets a real kick out of that. There is no trouble with the engine and two passenger cars going off of the tracks. The set is very sturdy and colorful. I would recommend this set to friends. We did purchase additional track.
3,Not as interesting as I hoped. Kids are not that excited about it.,Just runs around in circles. My son cut his hand on one of the rails when pressed too hard. Too overpriced in my opinion.
5,So hip and cool,My daughter has ALL the Doodle bears and of course insisted on the Doodle Girl. It did not dissapoint. She loves it!
1,Toddlers Sing Rock 'N' Roll Not as good as the others,The previous three Toddlers Sing cds are excellent. My grandkids enjoy them all the time. This Rock and Roll cd just does't do it! Music is too loud - none of the joy and excitement of the previous Toddlers Sing cds. A real disappointment.
3,"Country, plus much that isn't","I've been listening to country music for more than four decades, plus recently brushing up on music history while researching Faron Young's life. This book contains much good information, but I wonder how the writers define ""country."" In spite of all their hits, the Wilburn Brothers rate a two-inch column and David Houston gets three inches. Yet many, many performers I've never heard of (and non-country ones I have heard of) get a page or more. How often has Grateful Dead ever been played on a country station? Faron Young--a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame--is allotted one page, but Neil Young gets six. How many times did he appear on the country charts? None that I recall. Even the historical Carter Family is limited to two pages. There would have been room to give more information about more performers if the book had fulfilled the promise of its title."
3,So-so,"Not a bad book, but many key country artists of today are missing from its pages. Photos are lame, too. Can't bigtime publishers find something besides cheesy publicity shots?"
1,Warning - 1996 Technology !,"Calling this book an update is like saying you're going to update your car by buying a 1974 Holden Torana. This book was published in 1997, so it's limited to describing 1996 technology, no S/PDIF, AES/EBU, SDI, etc. The URL given in the book for the update website no longer exists. It is also very very basic, it looks at each piece of technology from a black box, user perspective - talking more about what it does than how it does it. If you really have no idea how the weatherman makes it from the studio into your home, then buy this book."
1,Should have kept it Under Wraps,"It pains me to give Ian and the boys this review. I looked on my Ipod and found that I have 18 Tull CD's stored on it. J-Tull is my all time favorite band and I have stuff from the earliest to the most recent. I suffered thru listening to Under Wraps, in its entirety, in hopes that maybe there would be 1 or 2 decent songs on there. Unfortunately, there isn't. All of this stuff is pretty lame techno-rock. I like a lot of techno, but not this. It just doesn't display Ian's voice, flute, or songwriting in a very good light. There is not one catchy melody or riff to be found. Nothing acoustic, either. Just a bunch of outer space gibberish. Don't waste your money or time on this one."
2,Doesnt make much light,"as cute as it is, it is not practical, and the price was very high for this item as well. it looks cool, but if ur trying to buy a light for a scared child i would not recomend this product"
1,Doing a chore 3 times!,"I dislike electric ranges, but I DESPISE glass-top ranges. The clean up is a HASSLE and Weiman adds to the hassle.1. Wipe on cleaner and scrub pad is required because this stuff does not clean.2. SCRUB and scrub and scrub and make a wish that won't come true.3. Wait for the cleaner to dry thoroughly (too soon and it's a hassle again).4. Wait... No quick clean ups here.5. Wipe flakes off with paper towel, elbow grease required again.6. Now clean up the mess of white flakes all over the range?!Never dreamed of using a hand-held vac on my range.7. Discover your wish did not come true and now the burnt spots show up better on a polished range.Save yourself the elbow grease and a used up wish.Use Cook Top brand instead - available on Amazon also."
1,WORTHLESS,Get the same results with some Windex....w/less streaking. These wipes do absolutley nothing more than a paper towel sprayed w/some window cleaner would.Pure junk.
4,Great shoes!!,My husband has been wearing these shoes for many years. Right now there are three other pairs at different level of wear--some only good for cutting grass or painting. Says they are the most comfortable shoes he can find. The quality of these shoes is not as good as previous identical shoes. One example is the tongue is not padded as the others are. Will see if they last as long.
3,A Bit Tight,The tennis shoes arrived on time and in excellent condition. This style seems to run a little small as I always have worn size 8 Reeboks but these were a bit snug. I would suggest allowing an extra half size on this style unless this was just an anomoly with the pair I ordered.
1,Kill Me Now....,"Okay, I seriously hated this book. I had such a hard time reading it. It reads like a sci-fi convention geek's collaborative writing assignment... ""Lets call the main character... Dagger... Dagger Chase oh and he's going to have a hot native American teenie bobber sidekick who can turn into animals. How cool is that?!""If I can forgive the bad dialogue (and pages and pages of it to boot), I really cannot deal with the protagonists name being ""Dagger"" everytime the name was written I had to choke back a snort of derisive laughter. It pulled me out of the story everytime. Plus the writer tells us whats happening too much via dialogue rather than showing us in action. He/she needs to write more descriptively and leave the long pages of dialogue for key points where dialogue is necessary. Plus Chases attraction to the young sidekick really made me wanna hurl.Feh. 1 star. A disappointing read. Goofy-characters, goofy names, goofy book. Waste of time."
3,Not the best of the series,"Even though these two movies are not the best of the series, I will still purchase this DVD. Although, ""The Gathering"" had some relatively bad acting in it, it was still a decent story which introduces us to the world of B5. ""In the Beginning"" was never as exciting as some of the best b5 episodes, but it is nice to watch to see where the characters began. Personally, I would like to see my favorites: ""Mind War"", ""Crysalis"", and ""War Without End"" come to DVD."
4,Could have been better but,"Unlike some DVD buyers, I actually buy them for the movie, not the extras, so I was perfectly happy with just getting the two films and not much more.Could the quality have been better? Probably, but it's still better than you get taping the episodes off the air. Strangely, the older, lower-budget pilot episode looked the best of the two.And to correct some mis-information, the second film, ""In The Beginning"" was not ""butchered"" to produce a widescreen version. The live-action was shot in widescreen originally, while the special effects shots were composed so they could be cropped for 16:9 presentation. Personally, since the really sweeping shots are usally special effects in this show, I'd probably prefer the fullscreen version for any future ""Babylon Five"" releases."
3,"Movie itself is great, DVD quality is not so great","I rate Babylon 5 as one of the best scifi series' of all time. That being said, however, I have to rate this particular DVD much lower than I had hoped. The grainy picture quality is unacceptable in a DVD. And the lack of extra features is disappointing."
5,Classy and functional!,"I bought this for my boyfriend who recently obtained his pilot's license and is continuing to train for additional certifications/higher licenses. He loves it, especially the stop watch feature. He's also commented on how nice the watch looks! Functional and it looks nice. You can't ask for anything more.He has yet to finish reviewing the manual for other features but he was very excited about it."
2,Nice pictures but not enough facts,"I didn't find this book useful. It didn't have enough factual content. It was composed of mainly pretty pictures and comments like ""All families are different"". It seemed appropriate for the 3-4 year old age group. I liked ""What's the Big Secret"" by Laurie and Marc Brown much better."
1,Making money off the Hip hop group Wu Tang plain and simple!,"the movie is horrible, very bad quality.seems to be a reject kung-fu film, but when Wu Tang the hip hop group came out it took that name to make money in the video stores. even though we all know Wu Tang got there name from a kung-fu movie this is not one of them. you want a good movie check out shoalin verses wu tang clan"
2,Beginners Guide,"This an insightful book about the authors experience with commodity trades. For those who are clueless and watch Mad Money, I wouldn't recommend this book because it doesn't visualization. It's More of a general overview of the basics, it brings a good feeling for individual investors who are stumbling to make a decent decision.Instead, go with Dona Kline, Kenneth Morris ""WSJ: Guide to Understanding Money and Investing"" or stick to the Dearborn PassTrack books. Also try Kaplan for continuous education, but don't rely on it too much.For those who are seriously taking the securities exams, always prepare yourself for 110%, nothing less.GO FOR IT !"
3,Just plain awesome,Every single track on this CD has something different to offer. Its by far the best Taproot album and one of the best CDs for the year in my opinion.
4,Photography At Its Best.,"Outstanding black and white photographs detail the route of Lewis and Clark. Created a generation ago, before the tourism hoopla of the expedition's bicentennial, this is a very fine look at American landscapes as the Corps of Discovery might have experienced them."
4,I wish the rubber parts were softer,"I wish the rubber used for it was softer. The curler itself seems to be nicely made, but not as substantial as others I've had before. I like the size and the shape of it."
3,Good for the price,"Over all I think this is a good toy for the price but this is not ""The Farmer Says"" of my youth. The new design with the pull lever is hard for my 15 month old and it causes him to get upset. The sound is very quiet and hard to understand. I don't think the animal sounds are as good as the orginal. I do like the size and the flap that changes between sets of animals seems to be fun for my son."
2,Disappointed!!!!,"First of all, I have to say I am basing this review off of the see n say I had when I was little. I was VERY disappointed when I got this. While the learning aspect of it is still there, it is small and cheesy and just not the same. For how expensive it is, I expected to get one similar to the one they made in the 80s. This is chintsy and should not cost more than $9.99... I purchased it for almost $25!! I kept it because I think it's still a great way to learn animal sounds, but I am still disappointed."
4,"Great fun for kids, sometimes annoying for parents","Our child loves this toy, especially so the ""bonus"" farmer doll ""Buddy"" that comes with it. The actual toy is ok but our child doesn't nearly love it as much as the little farmer doll. As parents, we find the doll more annoying than the see and say toy because the doll is a lot more monotonous than the see and say. The doll can not be washed, so for cleaning purposes keep that in mind. Once it gets really dirty by, say, falling in dirty slush or snow, it pretty much stays dirty. Don't take the doll outside! Educational value is about one or even close to zero, but the entertainment factor is a 4 star value."
2,"Not as good as the ""classic"" see and say...","My daughter has had this toy for about 2 years and has rarely played with it. She does, however, have two of the old ""classic"" see and says that the neighbor kid gave us. The old ones get more play time for sure. The ""quiz mode"" is too complicated for the younger ones. If they don't know how to answer the question, it will get stuck in that mode until someone gives it the correct answer."
3,The Farmer Says,The pull down bar is difficult to operate for a toddler. It is small in size so this makes it more difficult to see the pictures. Some of the animal sound recordings are very short in length which makes it less enjoyable for the child.
3,"Good Sounds, Lever Tough For Ages Who Would Enjoy Toy the Most","This remake of the classic pull string animal sound toy, uses a lever instead of the string. The farm animal sounds are fun, and the educational value is good for 9 months-18 months, in my opinion. The main issue I have with the toy (like a lot of others) is the lever. I would say the lever is designed for a 2+ year old to pull - younger kids can pull it partially, but not all the way, but the rest of the toy is really ideal for kids in the 9-18 month range. This mismatch keeps the toy from being a full recommendation. I would buy it again, but hope Fisher Price improves this product in the future."
3,Not as I remembered,"The manufacturer has miniaturized a toy that was a favorite of my kids back in the 70's. When purchasing this for my grandchildren, I was very disappointed in the size and appearance."
1,What a BIG disappointment !,"Well, the item got to me really quick. That's great for Toyzz. But OH MAN! I just threw away 30 bucks. The quality is not at ALL what you'd expect from FisherPrice. I can't believe they actually let this piece of plastic garbage get out of the factory! You can hardly understand what the farmer is saying, it's very warbled. The sound is atrocious. All you can hear is a vague representation of the animal the pointer is pointing to. I grew up with the original and I am saddened to learn this is what has taken it's place. DON'T BUY IT."
2,Fun toy but,"My 18 month old is having a VERY hard time pulling the lever while keeping the rest of the toy in place. He gets frustrated and so do I. He really likes the music, though. He likes to dance to it."
2,Lame. Pretty Lame.,"This is one lame video produced by Playboy. Well over half of the movie is talking about the history of the Playboy Mansion. Who cares about it's history? I know I don't. I bought the video to see beautiful naked woman, not hear about Hef.Granted, the video does include many beautiful playmates. The problem is that they each get so little air time. I'm not even sure how it got it's title. Maybe it's because the playmates spend time in Lingerie, talking about the mansion and how great Hef is. Beats me.If you would like to purchase this approximately one hour video, to see fifteen minutes of naked playmates, then maybe you should buy this video. My recommemdation is to pass on this one, I know I don't need or want it as part of my collection."
5,A superb dictionary,"I consider myself extremely lucky when in 1998, while in Norway, I was offered this dictionary by the University of Tromso. I have always been fascinated by words and have collected quite a number of dictionaries, including what I had till then considered the best dictionary: Hornby's. But Collins is better because it offers more words and meanings and because it is also a handy encylopedia, an indispensable reference book you should always keep opened on your desk. (Buy a nice book stand to protect this treasure.) Also, I have always felt more comfortable reading the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), which Collins uses (rather than that used in, e.g. American dictionaries).Unfortunately, after 5 years of constant use and abuse of this dictionary, I will have to buy a new one. I understand, though, that the 1998 edition has not been replaced with a new one.Kaz Dziamka, EditorThe American Rationalist"
5,Marvelous video,I have watched the video so many times and given it as a gift over and over again. It is a wonderful picture of the indescribable. Louie Giglio has done an outstanding job of helping the viewer to see outside of our small corner of the universe and appreciate the creator of it all. You will not be disappointed. It is great for all ages.
5,"Great Buy, Great Seller",This DVD came fast and in great condition! I would absolutely buy from Ruth's Collection again :)
4,Great features for the price,"Let me start by saying this watch boasts amazing features for the price. The slide rule bevel (almost a complete E6-B flight computer) is as accurate as the Citizen Skyhawk (both have about one increment error). It is very easy to use and rotates smoothly without a clicking noise. I've found it quite convenient to use the slide rule to multiply, divide, convert, and compute basic time/speed/distance relationships.I have two issues to gripe about with this watch. Firstly, though functional, the alarm is practically useless. When it goes off, it's nothing more than a faint whine - not enough to grab my attention when there's even minimal background noise (certainly not enough to wake me from sleep!). Secondly, the ""luminescent hands"" are about as bright as your average rock. That is to say, not very."
5,Beautiful music,Another great CD from Paul Lawler. Gives you the calm beautiful music you want for meditation and providing Reiki treatment.
4,"The Scariest Stories You've Ever Heard, Part II",I remembered having this book when I was younger and I don't know what happened to it. I found it online and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to revisit the memories. This product was delivered in good condition and in a timely manner. I also bought part one.
1,This sucks!!,"I am a 9-year old kid, and I have read every single book of the Wayside School series. Everyone in my class was talking about the movie, so I wanted to see it. I got the movie and watched it. Guess what? The movie is a disgrace to Wayside School. I don't think Louis Sachar should have allowed this movie to be made. The movie had no stories that the book did, and nobody was how they were described in the book. There was hardly any humor, and it sucked. It was very disappointing."
2,A little better than the first...,"At least something happened in Part 2 that made me want to pick it up and finish. Not at all like Part 1. Character development is great but you must throw in a little adventure, too. After all, this is Dragonlance, isn't it? Am I anxiously awaiting the finale'? No. But, I will read it. Lastly, the the infatuation between Mina and Chemosh is still dis-jointed. Still don't understand it or like it."
4,What? You didn't see it coming?,"Hmmm...well, unlike the previous reviewers, I didn't find the last 20 pages or so at all shocking or surprising. Well, maybe part of one sentence, but the rest Weis had foreshadowed from page 1 of this book, and even a bit in Amber and Ashes. Actually, even the other part had been foreshadowed, but I was too slow to pick up on it. In spite of that, the character development is terrific, and I'm very much looking forward to book 3. Weis continues to amaze, and even though I still miss Raistlin and Tas and the gang, I enjoy the new generation of characters and the new crises that occur. The most amazing thing is that every time I think she's written herself into a corner, she pulls another rabbit out of her hat and surprises me. Well, there's definitely going to have to be a pretty big rabbit in book 3 if she's going to continue to do that."
2,"disappointing and think i will return it. Also, TOY TITLE AND REVIEWS DO NOT MATCH","This is a review for the actual toy car seat dashboard with remote control. very disappointing small range of songs of short duration and annoying noises. Size of 9v battery needed for the remote is unusual and hard to find. I do not know why the reviews under this item are all for some elmo toy, also pictured. Elmo is not a dashboard with remote control."
5,Love this Cd!,"So I started listening to pepper because a friend told me about them. The first dc I got was pink vibrations and I loved it played it day in and day out! So I knew I had to get another kona town was his favorit out of all of them so that was the next one I got, and I love it aswell! This is a great band and product I live in texas and the don't sell there dc's here so I buy all of them from amazon!"
5,Pepper is simpy addictive,"Pepper's new cd Kona Town is far and away the best cd to come out all year. I picked it up at the Warped Tour, and have been totally addicted to it since. I agree with everyone else, this is a great cd. Everyone that I've shared it with has loved it. They seemed to have totally evolved from their last release give'n it though that cd is also great. If you like rock-reggae and anything that just flows this is a cd you have to have."
1,PATHETIC,"These guys aren't bad musicians, and the band is pretty tight. There's just one problem... they are easily the most blatant Sublime rip-off that has ever existed. This band is completely inauthentic and un-original. Don't waste your time with these guys."
5,Pepper Posse,"Great Cd Big fan of Pepper. They are another great Reggae-Punk-Dub-Rock band. To me they sound like they were Sublime influenced but they definately have a great unique style. Great Cd, get one of those used Cd's for 7.99 from above. Cd's only been out a week. Take advantage of that!!! Gonna see them live. Hey Jamie Lanin. Are you from Hawaii. Is pepper big over there? Good taste in music"
3,CMeSpeed,It works but it's the third one I've had to buy. When it falls off the window it has a tendency to break. Not many options if you need to fit it to the Garmin. Price was great at 1/2 what others wanted.
2,magellan mount,"I COULD NOT GIVE A FAIR REVIEW BECAUSE I DID NOT GET THE RIGHT ITEM THAT I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT WHEN I PURCHASED IT. WHEN I RETURNED THE ITEM THAT WAS SENT, I ALSO SENT THE PIECE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE,WHICH WAS BROKEN. SO IF YOU CAN SEND THE RIGHT ONE I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT.PLEASE EMAIL ME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS."
1,CHEAP CRAP - BROKE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT,"This product is SO incredibly cheaply made, I CAN'T imagine WHO uses it, and for what? TWO attempts to use this product failed almost instantly. The zipper teeth are made from an incredibly cheap plastic. I wasn't rough with them at all and they broke; and there was NO possibility of repair. I was totally shocked at how flimsy the zipper is... HOW in the world does this work for ""tarps?"" People yank on tarps... it's ludicrous. DON'T BUY THIS JUNK PRODUCT!!!"
5,Breaking Point Goes Right Over The Line,"Lunatic Calm's Breaking Point Is Just as Good As The First Better, Having A Sound Inbetween Aphex Twin And The Prodigy, With Their Own Style. Very Nice Lyricly Which are Atristically Improved from the first,But they dont seam to have as much as their Dark atmosphere they had in the songs on Metropol As much as Breaking Point, But Over All The Album is Wonderful, SOme Of The Tracks On The Album Including Slow Head beat songs With Enourmas energy such as ""Borderliners"" And ""Your Future"" And Hard Exciting Tracks Such as ""Beatbox Burning"", ""Neverstop"",""Sound Of The Revolution"", And ""Resurrection City"" Also there Are 2 Tracks""Yesterday"" and ""Nobody"" witch are very ambient sounding with nice synth, The Album Is Amazing, Difinitly a Good Follow Up To Metropol, This is not a waste of money at all"
5,Better than the Manufacturer.,Right from the first shot this battery performed like the Energizers we all know and love. Without an initial charge I got a total of 232 Photographs back to back just by hitting the shutter repeatedly. With the Manufacturer battery I wouldn't have gotten past 40. This is a great battery and really performs well when you need it especially in a high performance devices like the digital cameras we all have. I would recommend this product to anyone.
1,Low yield.....,"My manual Hurricane juicer gets a better yield than the lexen. I bought this juicer due to budget concerns, but I should have just saved my money. I juiced a 10x20 tray this am and had 1 1/2 oz of juice! I juiced 3 bunches with my manual and had 3/4 oz! Do your research!"
2,"Just not my favorite, noticable performance drop","Pennzoil, one of the best known and recognizable product in automotive and marketing today. It has a great fan following and product following. I honestly have not had the best of luck with the product. Many a time I have tried to use Pennzoil in my automobiles, and in the summer, not bad. But when it comes to the winter, It is noticably different. I have heard the Lifters in all of my cars, especially in winter, click more when starting up. This is just not a problem when I use other oils, mainly valvoline. Also, pennzoil is more of a parafin base to it, and one experience I had was seeing little chucks coming from my oilpan of pasty parafin. So, sorry for those guys that love pennzoil, but I just haven't had the greatest luck here in the midwestern weather."
3,better have fresh (wet) blood,"This item seems to be OK. The main problem we experienced was poor tracking ability if the blood had a chance to dry. This hunting season was fairly warm and the blood would dry really fast, so it didnt show up with the light as well as it would have been if the blood would have been wet. Hopefully next years hunting season will be colder so the blood will stay 'wet' for better tracking ability."
1,worthless,"Like most of the other reviews, I found this to be a waste of money. It was HARDER to see the blood with this light than a normal light and I made the mistake of buying several of them for friends. The white light was ok, but it burned through four new batteries in a little over two hours of use tracking a deer the other night. Complete junk...wish I had kept the receipts to return the lights."
3,nighttime only,"one important aspect of this item that is not made clear is that is will only work for tracking blood during the night. it does not work during the day. I thought the light would make blood stand out for a daytime track, but I tested it and it does not."
5,Gerber Carnivore Tracking Light,The order arrived promptly and the light itself would be able to do everything it was suppose to. When Gerber first released this light it was way overpriced as the durable quality is questionable e.g. water resistant and made of light breakable plastic. I don't know how well this would hold in the field being in rain and thrown in the bottom of your pack that possibly could crush the light. The scientifically combined led blue and red lights offer great blood tracking and I like the option of the white xeon light so you can see and get yourself out of the dark and home.
2,Takes forever to pop up!,My 1 yr old son got this and he crys because I have tocrank and crank and crank to get elmo to pop up. Plus it does go off by itself. This is the second SS toy I have that does this.
2,Creepy laugh...,Cookie Monster and Elmo laugh when the handle is touched or turned/cranked. VERY creepy. Cookie Monster sounds like a scary convict!!!!!!!
1,Dead or Alive? I'd say dead.,"When you listen to this album, you realize why Dead or Alive's best days (in both popularity and creativity) were already behind them by the mid-90's. This album is BORING; all of the songs sound the same and the production sounds terribly amatuerish. Definitely the beginning of the end for Dead or Alive."
5,UNBELIEVEABLE!,"After reading this for this many volumes, I cannot believe that it is still soo good. I recommend this for anyone who hasn't already read this."
1,Didnt work for me....,But then I havent found an in ear set that would stay in. As soon as I started sweating those bad boys popped out and I spent the rest of my hour long run fiddling with them till I gave up
1,Wrong Fence,"This fence is not the correct one for the new Taiwan made 14"" Delta bandsaws. After contacting Delta they me that it was too short and the correct model was the 28-858 and then hung up on me. So far I can not find the right rip fence and I am fairly disappointed with Delta and Amazon."
4,Good product,"Bought this for a replacement of the original one that came with the house. It installed quickly and it working just fine. It has limited options (fan speeds and lighting) but for the price, I can live with it."
4,Phoenix DZBIS-112iTTL Digital Autofocus Flash,"The Phoenix DZBIS-112iTTL Digital Autofocus Flash works well on my Canon EOS D450 XSi. It's not as powerful as a Canon Speedlight, but for no more often as I need a flash I can beat the quality or the price.I would recommended this product."
4,"Great display, but new model coming soon.","The new model will start at 1,399, but will include additional features to this model. It seems silly to pay more for an old model."
2,broken bottle.,"ooops, read the reviews AFTER I ordered. one bottle arrived broken, due to packing method. will be more diligent about the reviews."
2,Worked for a while,"I received what I ordered and only one wasn't usable, considering that it was glass being shipped, I was disappointed, but not surprised. My problem with these is that the droppers fell apart within 6 months. The rubber part came away from the rest of the dropper causing a black, sticky mess all over all the bottles that is very hard to remove from whatever it comes in contact with. My suggestion would be to buy a different product now, so you wont be wasting your money to replace them soon."
4,Not as Well-Written as Loung Ung's Account,"This book lends itself to easy comparison to Loung Ung's tome ""First They Killed My Father,"" and while ""When Broken Glass Floats"" is a good book it's not as fulfilling as ""First They Killed My Father."" ""When Broken Glass Floats"" leaves large chunks of time un-narrated, doesn't discuss the ramifications of the author's Chinese (as opposed to pure Khmer) heritage, and generally is a less engaging read. It finds a strength, however, in its greater number of ""cultural asides,"" that is, places in the text where the author directly addresses the reader and notes some small detail of Cambodian culture. Additionally, this book would have benefitted from an epilogue regarding the author's post-Cambodian life in the U.S., and would also have benefitted from some discussion either in the text or via footnotes, of what was actually happening politically at the time--it would make the story flow a little better."
2,When Broken Glass Floats; Growing Up Under the Khmer Rouge,"I found the day-by-day description of life in Cambodia during this period to be far too detailed and repetitive. Even though the story is quite harrowing, I found myself losing interest in the detail because it was so repetitive. I don't think the reader needed to have a minute-by-minute, day-by -day description of everything that happened to the author. The book could have been shortened considerably without losing any of its impact."
2,A great idea poorly executed,"I bought this to help a friend who was suffering through serious medical difficulties. I know through experience that meditation is a terrific element in the healing process. Wow, this might best be marketed as a sleep aid. Dr. Siegel has all of the best intentions, and great knowledge. Now, if only he had the smarts to pay a professional to record this. Avoid this like the plague unless you are greatly in need of rest. Boring is an understatement. I usually only give ratings as low as one star to products that never arrive, so this gets a two. Poor Dr. Siegel, so well trained and so clueless as to delivery. Sigh."
5,How Great is Our God/ Louie Giglio,One of the best Christian movies we've seen in a long time and certainly want to look into others that have been put out by Giglio.
2,Disapppointed,SO disappointed in this. Bought this CD for a Luau luncheon and after seeing The Aliis and Arthur Lyman's groups both in the 70s (from Hawaii) was looking for REAL Hawaiian flavor. This is so mediocre and could have been done in Chicago.
4,UA slider,A good product... Fits nicely. Buy a cup separately. Should save me quite a bit of pain and discomfort this season.
4,Met My Expectations,"Overall I was satisfied with this purchase. The necklace looks as it is portrayed in its image and description. My only issue with the product was that some of the stones and pearls were loosely attached to the chain and fell off when the necklace was removed from the box. While this is an easy fix (no tools required), I would advise customers to check the necklace for this and make sure it is all in one piece as soon as it arrives, especially if it is intended to be a gift."
2,NOT good,"This telenovela is a complete waste of time and money. I painfully endured the entire first DVD, and it completeley failed to grab my attention. This story takes place during a Mexican civil war, which I believe goes on thru the entire production. I'm a huge fan of Barbara Mori, but this is one of her early days telenovelas, when she was a young girl starting her acting career. Her acting, as well as that of the other actors, is terrible. Very dissappointed."
5,La mejor telenovela,"This is by far, the best telenovela. I couldn't stop watching it, very addictive. the best is 48 HOURS!!!!!!!!! I hope they make more like these! Barbara Mori and Mauricio Ochman are amazing, the chemistry they share is powerful!very good telenovela, great story and very romantic :)"
1,horrible mexican telenovela,This is the worst DVD I have ever purchased. I was induced to acquire it by the number of stars it had. But actuallyI dont think it deserves even one. It is a very disgusting mexican telenovela extremely light and absurd. I feel very upset.
3,only hardcore Death fans need apply,"This is classic Death but far from a ""must have"" disc. While being rather brutal music, the songs are very simple and less refined than on their later records. Of course, Death was a lot less experienced when they did this record.I HIGHLY recommend buying Death's ""Leprosy"" instead of this one. It is possibly the best Death Metal reord ever produced."
5,"Finally, a new band I can actually LIKE!",I've given up on new music lately... I haven't liked a lot of new bands since the 90's.I found this CD on someone's ListMania... someone who also liked grunge and alternative bands that I used to like.I LOVE this CD!! It has been in my CD player for a few weeks now and I'm not sick of it! That's rare for me. I even crave it when I haven't been in my car all day. My favorites are the 4th and 12th tracks.Give them a try!
5,vent shade review,Cums with everytging you need even alcohol pads. Bought for my honda accord 98 sedan perfect fit. Great price. Fast shiping
5,"Toshiba 30HF83 30"" HD ready tv with pure flat screen","Well, I just received the toshiba tv.The tv came a day before scheluded delivery,well wrapped and was delivered right in my livingroom.the pictures are above expectation except for the sound that could be better, but with an external speaker which I already had, the sound is great.Also, I received the manuel and the original remote control.Overall, I am very satisfied with the tv and want to thank the seller for his handling of the whole matter.thanks againLionel"
4,Numan Excels Live,"Gary's had many ups and downs in his career. Yet, through it all, his live albums tend to serve him well. This might be one of the best. Sound is very clear, the performance is solid with just enough loose and raw ambience to give it edge. The set list is really what makes this stand out though. This was recorded on the 'Sacrifice' tour, so that album is well represented. What recommends this, however, is focus on tracks that are rarely heard live. ""Cars"" and ""Metal"" are absent from this set. Instead you get b-sides, Tubeway Army and Numa tracks like 'Noise, Noise', 'Stormtrooper in Drag', 'The Hunter', 'Jo the Waiter' and 'I'm and Agent'."
1,One page of info packed in a book of fluff,"If you understand how to rub a woman's clitoris, you know everything this book teaches. What a load of fluff! Chapters on overcoming fear, how you should respect your partner, all this and stories that have nothing to do with anything other than increase the page count. There are a lot of great books on sexual techniques and interactions, but this book is only of value (and then only about five pages) to people who have never had sex before."
1,What... no ZERO star option??,"Keyboard ok. MOUSE IS TRASH. I have had this ""thing"" for just one day and already the mouse button squeeks worse than if it were a live mouse!!! I'm off to Circuit City and this puppy is going in the trash bin where it belongs. For $35 I didn't expect top quality but I DID expect it to work correctly for more than a day!!! Geez. And no warranty of course... because I didn't PAY THEM AN EXTRA $15 (on a $35 item???)... I can see why they require you to pay extra for a warranty... they know it's trash. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
3,"Decent Keyboard, below average mouse","The keyboard works well with my laptop (which functions more or less as a desktop for me)and has good range. However, I was disappointed in the mouse and stopped using it after about 48 hrs. and went back to an older ergonomic Microsoft model. The mouse was cheap and difficult to control, often moving/""twitching"" the cursor around the screen for no apparent reason."
3,Nice keyboard for slow typist.,I bought this keyboard for my wife. The keyboard touch is too heavy and the transfer rate too slow to keep up with her typing speed (+100 wpm). She went back to her wired keyboard after two days of frustration. I don't have a problem with it as I punch the keys at about 20 wpm max. The volume control and media keys work well on an XP computer.
3,"Comfortable keys, poor range","This Logitech keyboard has nice resistance and typing quality. The wireless range is limited. I had to move the receiver from under the desk where I had my previous one to on top of the desk. It's about 2 feet from my keyboard and mouse, and seems to work fine there. Any further than that, or any obstacles between them, and it isn't entirely reliable. Fine equipment for the price."
2,Fragile,The mouse is great but the keyboard is very fragile. It was cheap but I expected something better from Logitech.
1,Logitech should be Ashamed,"I am an IT professional who has purchased many hardware items for over 30 years. This may be the most surprising for two reasons:1. The number of good reviews it gets.2. Logitech, generally known for good devices, would brand its name on this unit.Construction - is poor however on par with the price point.Keys - very poor and a cheap feel to them.Range - now here's where it falls flat to the unacceptable level. I contacted Logitech about the range which is only about 4 feet. To my shock and amazement, Logitech states this is the acceptable operating range of this unit. This was confirmed by their own website:[...]Now, if someone needed a max range of only 4 feet, wouldn't a corded model do?Conclusion - Logitech should simply be embarrassed of putting it's name on this one. It tarnishes an otherwise good reputation."
2,Logitech,"The cordless mouse is great,BUT... the keyboard I have is a pain in the bum! the spacebar and several of the letter keys are prone to sticking right out of the box. I realize that I may have just got lucky and got the only lemon made by logitech(sometimes S#!T happens) !.But since they are sold as a pair I can't give a high score."
2,Nice Price with Crazy Hidden Cost,"I would like to give this set 4 stars when I got it first day. The reasons are cheap price with wirelss function even the quality is soso.However, I change my mind after 2 week. The worse thing is the power consumption. The mouse bottom sense red light is always ON, even you truned off the computer. I believe the keyboard does, too. (Keyboard has no LED light for me to tell, but you can know per change battery period.) This set is a crazy battery drinker.In addition, this set requires way more battery power to work normally. I take out the batteries after the mouse losing control and put batteries into my old Logitech mouse (Logitech LX5 Cordless Optical Mouse). OMG, it still can work for extra 2 weeks.I just wanna give this battery drinker 1 star after I used it 1 month.Overall, the end out is 2 stars from its advantages and disadvantages. I would say ""Don't look at its current price, but think about your future cost."""
3,Big delete and F mode buttons bugs me,"I don't fancy the big Delete button and neither do I like the useless F Mode button. As a non-windows os user I don't like either those blue logos on F2-F4 functions keys marking Word, Excel and PowerPoint.Keyboard itself is not a bad one. It's not too heavy either. It takes two AAA batteries, which last in my use about a year.Mouse is OK too, I have seen and used better ones, but this does the job. It eats two AA batteries in about two months, so you better get accus and rechanger."
1,poor performance and eventual break down,"the lag that was previously mentioned is very real. in addition, when using this in conjunction with a laptop, the drivers cause an error on every boot up, resulting in a 5-7 minutes boot up cycle. hibernation is nothing more than a memory, as when restoring from hibernation, the drivers cause a blue screen and then a reboot. the drivers also disable the ""tap"" feature on my laptop mousepad...why? i have no idea, but it works fine once i uninstall the logitech drivers.no driver updates are available and my laptop works the way it used to when i uninstall the drivers.i didn't even have the patience to call the logitech helpdesk - what would they tell me? ""please reinstall the drivers""? ""please be sure the connections are tight"", etc? all of which i've tried...as of today, the keyboard is only responding with every 5th or 6th character i type in...i'm returning it today as well..."
4,Just what I needed,"Just what I needed for tidy control of my entertainment center PC.Elevating receiver base is the key to using the combo 10'+ from PC. Yes, keybd is a bit light weight for everyday use, but for a few keystrokes a day it's more than adequate...glad I didn't pay more."
3,Prefer traditional clippers,I tend to over clip my cuticles when I use this device. I also have a more standard cuticle clipper and that works better for me.
2,Not what I was expecting...,"If you're looking for a cuticle clipper to give you a clean, good looking manicure, this is not a good choice! I don't find this item to be very sharp, and it leaves the edges of my cuticle a little ragged. I'm going to stick to the bulky larger cuticle clipper for my manicure, but I suppose this one would be a good item for traveling, or for men, or for anyone who isn't trying to give themselves a manicure that looks like you just stepped out of a salon. And it is DEFINITELY not worth the price!"
5,A must for pianists and fans of classical music,"Enrique Graf and Nibya Marino collaborate wonderfully for Poulenc's Concerto for 2 Pianos. The two of them together result in a grand display of impeccable technique, tradition, and musicality. I have heard them perform this same concerto live, and this recording is the next best thing. The Prague Wind Quintet work with Graf as if they had been performing together for years--effortless. Graf shines as the all-star in the Sonata for Flute and Piano. His thoughtful phrasing and grand technique accent each other in every note. A must-have for pianists and Poulenc fans alike."
5,Excruciatingly FUNNY,"When asked what he felt the difference between an amateur and a professional comedian was, Groucho Marx answered...""An AMATEUR thinks it's funny to get a stunt man, dress him up like an old lady, stick him in a wheelchair and push him off a cliff but for a PROFESSIONAL, it has to be a REAL, OLD LADY!!"" I think GROUCHO would have loved SHELDON AND MRS. LEVINE.When I stopped into the Monessen Public Library to look through their 'FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY BOOK SALE', I certainly did not expect to find one of the funniest books I'VE READ TO DATE! The creativity and humor employed to take a look at this overly-dependent, mother/son relationship, left me laughing out loud AND wondering if the book was out-of-print, since I was already thinking of many friends with whom I wanted to share the laughter. Perhaps, it isn't for all palates but I would invite, ENCOURAGE, everyone to have a GO at it!! Like me, they might find it surprisingly, delightfully, refreshingly FUNNY!!"
1,rip off,"Why do I buy these,literally every other handle rips out from little or no pressure before I even pull them tight.Thought I got a bad batch in a box,so I bought a second time to have it happen all over again,I'm switching back to no brand names."
3,Only one reason to hear this recording - Zancanaro.,"Zancanaro, who sings the title role here, is a ""throwback"" singer - a magnificent baritone voice, in some ways reminiscent of Titta Ruffo. He may not have the subtlety of Gobbi, but what a great piece of singing!What a shame, then, that Zancanaro's surroundings are so inferior. Dessi and la Scola are no more than adequate, and barely that.This shouldn't be anyone's first, or only Rigoletto recording - but you really gotta hear Zancanaro."
4,Unbreakable!,"Unbreakable! My daughter has had this toy for 2 yrs and it still works!Cute, entertaining and educational."
3,grasping for connections,"Danticat's novel on loss, memory and the kinship between women, is missing the thread connecting the reader to the page. I would have rated the book as a two star read, but, she does have a strength in her writing: there's an ability there to carry the reader along that I think might come out better in a more cohesive piece. A story mainly about displacement and pain, Danticat loses out by not establishing a richness in her characters. The book is filled with traumatic, painful moments, but it was difficult to churn up any feeling because I felt like I didn't really know the character's, nor did I care much about them."
4,Brilliant and colorful in its rich cultural descriptions,"In Breath,Eyes,Memory, Edwidge Danticat drags you into a rich world of century old Haitian culture, the only world that little Sophie Caco has ever known. Sophie is sent from her tropical haven in Haiti to the United States to reunite with her original birth mother. In Breath,Eyes,Memory, two contrasting worlds and women come together as one through their common Haitian heritage. I found that this book contained beautifully written phrases and very descriptive sensory images."
4,GRIPPING,"MS. DANTICAT DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB BRINGING THE SUBJECT OF FEMALE CIRCUMCISION TO THE PAGE. IT REALLY MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS A WOMEN MUST GO THROUGH JUST TO PROVE THAT SHE IS WORTHY . MS. DANTICAT DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB REVEALING THE THOUGHTS OF THE CHARACTERS. ONE IS ABLE TO FEEL AND SHARE THE PAIN OF THE WOMEN IN THIS BOOK. THIS BOOK WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE FUNNY OR AMUSING. THIS BOOK MAKES ONE THINK ABOUT HER OWN WOMANHOOD. ALTHOUGH TRAGIC, THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. A MUST READ FOR ALL WOMEN,"
5,Hurston & Danticat,"I read Breath, Eyes and Memory a few years ago. Danticat's write style reminds me of Zora Neale Hurston. Her style is unique in that its lyrical cadence places your imagination right smack dap in the middle of the setting, whether in a Haitian market or a Brooklyn flat.I featured this book on the cover of my bookstore newsletter at the first opportunity after I read the book. I recommend this book for any one looking for a good read with a guarantee: if you don't like the book, bring it back for a full refund. I haven't had one come back yet.I am so glad that Danticat is receiving the recognition she is so worthy of getting. Right on OPRAH!"
2,"Wham, bam, and thank you ma'am.","I must admit I couldn't put the book down! I was intrigued by the story in the way one is drawn to the aftermath of a multi-car chain reaction accident. As I read, I anxiously searched the pages looking for souls who had survived the impact. I was disheartened and disappointed in the answer: Those who managed to survive this catastrophe would do so in the way one is said to have ""survived"" when placed on ""life support""."
2,Textbook characters,"I found this book more of a lecture on Haitian culture and characters who serve as ""types"" rather than people with complexity. If the setting weren't related to Haiti, would it still be considered such a good novel?"
3,Good insight into the village life of female Haitians,"Quick read...good insight into the village life and culture of female Haitians. Danticat is not as skillful in getting you to care about the characters, however. It is rather stilted reading and there is little introduction of characters or setting."
2,No dreams left,"Yes, this is a typical award-winning book; written by a young black woman, subject matter being the so-called 'everyday angst' that critics yearn for these days. Danticat has the makings of a poet, but it's sad to say she can't weave a decent plot. Instead, this books keeps wandering in the wilderness of destroyed dreams, traumatic human relationships and the difficulties of being a woman. As a male person, I must say this doesn't touch me. I think the book is pathetic, too sentimental. Not the worst of its kind, but I would never recommend it to a friend."
5,Opens your eyes to another way of life!!,"I have grown up in a community with many Haitian people . I have never known much about the life they left behind in Hati. The rich story telling in this book educated , moved me and changed me. I recomend it highly ."
2,has very little relevance for students of european politics,"Although in many ways this is a fine book, I have to warn the potential buyer that it ignores many of the important issues associated with european integration. Some material on the institutional balance of ecosoc and the court of auditors would have been helpful. All told, a thoughtful and cogent study but if you are only going to buy one book about the enormous changes sweeping europe I would not recommend this sadly unfocused title."
3,Good until the last 20 pages,Beautifully lyrical and full of hope even during personal tragedy but the ending takes all that building emotion and dashes it. The ending spoiled the book for me. It seemed unnecessarily tragic -- tragic just for the sake of being tragic.
4,Thought-provoking fiction,"What a grand adventure! BREATH, EYES, MEMORY is a stunning accomplishment, one of those rare books that open one's mind to limitless experience and perception. I recently read the new novel everyone is talking about, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, and didn't think anything could top it, but Eyes has come close. What a book!"
4,Flawed...but ultimately moving and well written,"The whole while I read this book, I was taken in by the good prose and interesting story. As well, though, I was thinking to myself on many occasions that many parts could have been more smooth and parts could have been cut out completely, and that's not a very good thing while reading a book. But, on the whole, I would recommend this book for a commendable effort."
3,"Lots of good text, bad presentation","I'm very interested in PLM related issues and PLM as a concept has become essential for the company I work for. When I opened this book and tried to read it I became a little exhausted - more than 400 pages with no pictures or figures or charts - only text and pages of various kind of detailed lists. I wonder who are the ones in the core interest group of this book? Certainly not business readers, I personally don't have enough time to or effort to go this through even though I'm very sure that all PLM issues are in place and explained in great detail. From my perspective this is not something to read in a plane."
5,A goldmine,"This is a goldmine of high-value material with rich veins of knowledge and experience. It will be highly valued by readers in the Manufacturing sector handling the complexity of developing, supporting and managing products in the global economy.Nuggets like the PLM paradigm lie on the surface. More highgrade material lies under the surface with even a 30 slide appendix to save you days of work.Space shuttles, tires, SUV's, drug products, elevators, with collaboratively-developed, globally-used products the need for Product Lifecycle Management is omnipresent. Unless PLM is implemented expect even more problem products. But implementation will take more than management presentations of cool and colorful Powerpoint slides. PLM is a new way of thinking, flying in the face of century-old thinking, and isn't so easy to take aboard.This is a profound book building the foundations of a new paradigm for product development, realization, use, management. Reading it is an enrichening experience."
4,up to date overview of plm,"I highly recommend this Book. A clear and complete Overview about PLM from Definition to Implementation. Strategy, Barriers, 'Reality Check' and a View into the Project Management of PLM."
4,nice looking and works well!,"We needed to find a fireplace accessory kit that would be somewhat childproof. Although we didnt find any childproof kits, this was the best one that came close because the base is very heavy and wont topple over if a kid runs up and pulls on it.The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it came in black to match our fireplace. Other than that, it is a very good quality product and the sellers shipped it very quickly!"
1,Family fun stalled by ridiculous game,This was a gift at a party. The idea was that the entire family could play the home version of this fun television show. Not! There were so many rules that it took the fun out of it and was the complete opposite of the simplicity of the tv version. This is a box that will sit in the closet unused for years until it makes it's way to the trash.
1,Belongs in the Rubbish Bin,"A ballerina having her legs cut off and crawling pathetically through darkened corridors, dragging the stumps of her legs behind her, a girl having a power drill inserted in the top of her head and another girl having the top of her head lopped off so her brains can be consumed, are neither erotic nor entertaining. I have roughly the same reaction to this mess as I have to watching surgery on television, except that the surgery might have a point to it.The only redeeming feature is that the above effects were obviously faked. But anybody who finds these concepts entertaining belongs in an institution. This kind of trash is an advertisement for censorship.My copy has been consigned to the garbage bin."
4,Blood Sucking Freaks...I can see why it is a cult classic!,"Disturbing, sick movie. I love it. A super sick cult classic that I hear had a following much like the Rocky Horror Picture Show had in its time.Not my introduction to Troma movies that's for sure, but my first Troma DVD. And it it loaded with extras! This is the way DVD's should be made! There is the Troma studio tour, Public Service Announcements, Videos, Cast Commentary throughout the movie, and a whole bunch of other stuff! I will definitly try to get all my Troma movies on DVD."
3,"It's somewhat boring, yet somewhat enetertaining","Bloodsucking Freaks is one of those movies that is boring, but it also has some very interesting scenes. It's totally TROMA, though I know that they didn't have anything to do with the production of the film. It's about this fella named Sardu. Sardu runs an underground theater that shows live torture, and it's up to the audience to determine if what they're seeing is real or not. It's old, so the effects are very dated. But there's plenty of nudity and fake looking gore to keep your attention if you like that sort of thing. Something tells me you do though, otherwise you wouldn't be reading this now! Worth a look for TROMA fans, and certainly worth the purchase for fans of hardcore exploitation films."
2,Interesting for a listen or two,"The Roger Dean cover attracted me to it. Most of the music inside repelled me from it. The short songs aren't bad, a very indie style with minor psych leanings. But they are nothing special and I've heard it done better elsewhere. The long songs such as Where the F**ks my Wallet? which openings the album are absolutely horrid ambient noodling tracks which go nowhere and take forever to do it. This band simply doesn't have the chops to do progressive rock, and their attempts fall flat. Best thing about the album: I only paid fifty cents for it!"
2,An orgy of plagiarism,"This is the most plagiaristic album I have ever heard. From the first track (which begins with an [imitation] of Pink Floyd's ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"") to the last (which ends with two minutes of repetition of a guitar riff from Yes's ""Gates of Delirium"") there is nothing here that wasn't lifted from some art rock album from the 1970's. Buy the originals, not this."
4,great for indoor plants,It took a while to get but it was worth the wait.I received two Bonsai plants for my birthday and the spray attachment sprays gently and evenly.The clear spout shows how much water is in the can so you can add the exact amount of fertilizer.I would have given the product 5 stars if it came in a better color.
5,Great little watering can,I purchased this Oxo Good Grips watering can about a month ago. I use it daily and I really like it. I had a little problem like a prior reviewer with water leaking at the swivel base but I hand-tightened it and I haven't had a problem since then. The 3-quart is the perfect size for watering plants indoors. I plan to get the 2-gallon size for watering plants on my balcony so I don't have to return for water as often. I'd readily recommend this product
5,Another tool toward peace,"-I read this book in an afternoon. It was an absolute joy to read. It gives you three different views on each of the 7th pathways proposed. James Twyman, Gregg Braden, and Doreen Virtue each explain concepts from their knowledgebase to enable the reader to understand.I received a spiritual boost from this tome. I especially appreciate the prayers of peace from the twelve major religions and James' condensation of each.This is truly a tool to guide the planet Earth toward peace. If only it were mandatory reading for all citizens of our planet."
5,Recommended,"A MUST for photographers who want to do still life photography. Lots of ideas and ""how to"" information. Loved it!"
2,Showing its age,"This book reads like it was written before digital photography and Photoshop were viable options for the professional photographer. Many of the elaborately staged shots are laughable and seem quaint compared to today's techniques. Don't let the cover images fool you either, most of the shots inside have a very 1980s feel to them. Even so, a handful of the shots have useful lighting information, so this will stay on my studio's bookshelf."
2,Skip it,"I was very disappointed in this book. I bought it, thinking that it would be a fluffy beach read...which it was. However, it's also inane and annoying. The characters are stereotypical, the writing style is juvenile, and the plot is predictable. Overall, not worth the money."
5,Just Finished and LOVE IT!,"So far this is a great series though I've only read books one and two so far. I will be reading the others. I agree with another reviewer who said this second book is even better than the first one. It has more twists and turns than a roller coaster ride! I literally couldn't put it down and read it mostly all the way through in one stretch. Not many books get me to do that! I need my beauty sleep...Samantha Casey is a heroine to be admired. She has strong values and a mystic ability inherited from her Lakota Sioux genes to ""see"" into people's lives after they're dead. That comes in handy doing police homicide work or private investigation. The plot development is strong as is that of the several sub-plots that are ongoing. A ""make you catch your breath"" ending doesn't hurt either. The only thing I can think of to add is, the retired FBI director had to know from the beginning...it will make sense if you read the book."
3,too much sugar for a dime,"While it is nice to make characters real, too much involvement in their personal lives detracts in this genre. The flow is poor."
1,not by kid creole & the coconuts,Do not buy this album--it's a cover band! The package doesn't make that clear until you open it ...
2,Depends on what you're looking for...,"I teach composition at a mid-sized Catholic university in the mid-Atlantic region and used this as my course text last semester (the department's choice, not mine) with decidedly mixed results. If you want your students to get beyond ""mere rhetoric"" and into critical analysis, this NOT the text you should be using. Most of the examples quoted are taken from newspaper editorials, which are notoriously one-sided and don't exactly encourage the reader to give the opposition's view a fair shot, and the last half is a handbook (useful if you don't want your students to have to purchase more than one book, but frustrating if you'd rather see those pages devoted to substantive material on teaching composition). If you like the argument/debate model of writing instruction (I don't), this will probably work out better for you than it did for me. I must also note that most of my students found the book's tone patronizing."
2,"A great book, but...","The work in this book is awesome, but I was really let down by the paper and print quality of this book...all the work in the book is now copyright free and I was really hoping to use some of it in my work but because the work is so intricate, the printing quality makes much of it unusable. A big disapointment."
1,"Poor quality, worse pricing","We've played with this tower at public train stations, in private homes, and then I looked at 15(!) of them at a local box store. This is a lousy accessory that breaks almost as soon as you buy it. Or in the case of the box store, only half of them worked in the store to begin with. There aren't a lot of water towers on the market, so you'll probably buy it anyway, but be forwarned that it is the usual Thomas Made-in-China junk that will probably be recalled like all of the Thomas products because of toxic something. Also, the pricing above it exactly 200% of the list price."
1,Overly simplistic - there are better books,I would avoid this book. There are much better real estate books and Mr. Cook's advice is suspect.
3,Get the full season DVDs instead,"I bought this box set before the full season DVDs came out. It was great to hold me over until season 1 came out, but when I received that, this box set was obsolete. In my opinion, the episodes chosen are good, but they aren't all the best.If you're a real Friends fan (and you must be if you're looking into this set) then just get the full season DVDs. They have 1, 2 and 3 now and will be coming out with them all. You'll be much more satisfied and it's a better investment to have every single episode anyway."
3,Buy the full seasons instead!!!,"This disc is really not worth buying, for a little more money you should buy the full season sets! You get a lot more for your money and you can watch them in order instead of broken up like in this set. For the true Friends fans, this would be a waste of money!!"
5,Can't get enough of Friends,"I purchased the Best of Friends DVD but this set is not good enough for me. I think that all episodes of this comedy is a riot, I love watching them over and over.I am willing to spend whatever the cost will be just to get the complete series (anybody out there who would want to sell?)."
1,"Nope, still not good...","A reader from Chicago is absolutely right. I didn't finish the book because it was completely and totally too absurd. And obviously, someone does not like for others to have their own opinion on such matters."
1,Skip This One,"I purchased this book hoping for an unbiased examination of the assertions made in the da Vinci Code, many of which stood in the face of my traditional Catholic upbringing. What I found was an obviously exasperated and sarcastic slam of Brown's book. Clearly the author is distressed by the novel and couldn't wait to get her two cents in, based on her obvious devout Christian beliefs. If you are looking for clear comparison of the novel and historical fact, skip this book. There are many better written works on the subject."
5,Great Resource,"Full of interesting, thorough arguments and facts.Simple to read, but not simplistic at all.Just what's needed.And a reviewer from San Diego neglected to mention that Welborn addresses the ""fiction"" question quite thoroughly, leading one to wonder how closely he/she actually read this book. Of course the Da Vinci Code is fiction - the problem is the many readers who don't think it is (read the reader reviews of the novel if you want to figure this out). This same reviewer can't spell the author's name of this particular book correctly, doesn't note the many, many sources used and cited within the chapters (the books mentioned at the end of each chapter are clearly labeled ""for further reading""), and leaves us all wondering exactly what a ""scorce"" is.No, this is clearly one of the top Da Vinci Code- related books out there."
1,"This is a disgrace to Vladigerov - terrible performance, poor introduction","One of the most respected composers in the Eastern European music scene, Pancho Vladigerov (whose music was adored by people like Strauss, Shostakovich, Herbert von Karajan, who was teacher of Alexis Weissenberg and a friend of Albert Einstein), deserves better than this sloppy performance riddled with incorrect tempi, mediocre playing, passionless interpretation.To top it off the CD contain an ""introduction"" by some Balazs Zay which is cold and filled with passive-negative remarks - completely unjustified at that, which only shows Zay's inability to accurately evaluate and appreciate one of the geniuses of Eastern European music, much less to write competently about it.Save your money, do not buy this CD. If you truly want to acquaint yourself with Vladigerov's wonderful works, this is not the proper place to start."
2,Princess of Ancient Greece review,"I think this doll is very pretty and for a collector it is wonderful! The problem is that THE OUTFIT DOESN'T COME OFF!I would like to slap the Mattel people for sewing her outfit on her. Also, I put three stars for durability on account of the fact that I popped the seem on the side of the dress when I was trying to get it off. I don't know when they started this, but I know that the Princess of Japan has a removable outfit. I'm not sure that I will be buying any more Barbie Dolls of the World because of this and I am extemely disapointed in Mattel."
3,Strongly recommended for anyone entering a contest!,This book has proven helpful as our organization has strived to improve our non-leather contest as well as for our friends who are now competing in leather contests. I strongly recommend this title for anyone who is involved in any aspect of the contest circuit.
3,"Comfy, but....","Very comfortable and warm, but mine did not have a seat ""flap,"" it was more of a slit. I was expecting a horizontal 2-button seat flap, like the kind you see in old Westerns or cartoons. This was a 1-button vertical slit. Not very flattering.Not a big deal, I guess, except I got it as a costume and was really looking forward to the seat flap, as weird as that sounds."
2,There are better Thomas additons,Our three year old rarly includes this engine was in his railroad set ups anymore because many of his Thomas trains don't fit through it well. The rollers are also some kind of foam that I doubt would hold up to a whole lot of use. Save your money.
5,Met My High Expectations!,"After reading a lot of reviews for motion-sensing light fixtures, I bought this product. I've had this switch installed for about a year and a half, and have had absolutely no problems with it. It works as expected, and I have high expectations.The switch came complete with the wall plate, was easy to install, and offered clear instructions for use. I replaced a standard light switch in a stairway to a basement that is shared by mutiple residents as a way to ensure that lights aren't left on by accident. The switch turns the lights on when the stairway is entered and keeps them on for about fifteen minutes, more than long enough for the average basement drop-off/pick-up. On the occasions when I have needed to work on a project and need the lights on longer, there is a switch (""Off/Automatic/On"") which allows the lights to remain on until turned off, like a standard light switch.Great product!"
4,Wall switch,Great product for bathroom lights but does tend to make flourescent lights slightly dimmer when on sensor mode.
2,not for electronic ballast flourescent,"The lower cost Leviton motion sensing switch does not work with high efficiency, electronic ballast, fluorescent lighting. All new fluorescent lighting is electronically ballasted for higher efficiency. The Leviton rated for electronic ballast costs about $50 though."
1,PR-180 is not a True Three Way,"Per a Leviton Technical Rep on January 2, 2008:""When using the PR180 in a 3 way the only functionality you will receive from the standard 3 way switch in manual on while the sensor is in auto. If the sensor is in the on or the off position the 3 way switch will have no effect."""
2,Denis,"Much better choice:Enerlites WOS15-W Passive Infrared Single Pole Wall Switch Occupancy Sensor, WhiteI purchased this in home depot and returned it after installing, here are the reasons:1. does NOT work with fluorescent bulb2. the range is very shallow3. the switch is falling off4. light sensitivity can not be adjustedall of these do not exist in the Enerlites model sold on Amazon for $18 no tax.good luck!"
1,only works with incandecant bulbs,"I was excited for this product, my kids are always leaving the bathroom light on. cannot use with CFL bulbs, cannot buy incandescent bulbs anymore. Ad is deceiving I returned it."
3,Not that bad.,"this game isnt that bad. the pin physics suck, its seems like the kinda float after the ball hits them. and some times a pin will hit another pin, and that pin will not move. you can turn the music off and put a cd in your cd player, whick takes care of the crappy music problem. the create a bowler and create a ball suck, but thats not that important anyways. overall, ive had a good time playing this, but if you want a really good bowling game, try brunswick circuit pro bowling for the ps one. its way better, and the pin physics are dead on."
2,Not satisfied,I was not satisfied since it does not use Kinect. I did not even try to play with the controller since it would be very boring.
1,Horrible with no response from Brookstone,This was the pits. We were so excited to fix a few of our kids DVD's they scratched. When it arrived we followed all the directions. We did 2 DVD's one of which will now no longer work at all. We've tried 3 DVD players and it just says error. We contacted Brookstone and have got 0 Response....Very misleading and lack of service for a retailer like them is frustrating. Although I've bought many a things there I won't go back and encourage anyone not to as I've never had an issue until now and they clearly don't care they sold a faulty product. Boo to this - total bummer as it is a great idea.
4,Scott's Review,"I am a 7th grader at Washingotn middle school. We have just read this book in class and I really enjoyed it. I feel that Clemence McLaren did a good job portraying the good side of Helen and Cassandra. In most of the other books Helen is very mean and snobby. Cassandra who is cursed by Apollo. Even with her sight of the future, nobody will believe her. In this story however she tries to do good, but to no avail. Altogether the book was very exciting filled with treachery and secret plans.Thank you, George Namilton"
5,Inside the walls of troy,"In the book a 12-year old girl got kidnapped by thesus and was brought to Athens. When she was brought back by her 2 brothers. The suitors were there. Dozens and Dozens came and she married a hariy old man Menelus. Her love did come along (Paris) and she got brought to Troy and the only 2 people who knew she was coming and was going to bring disturuction to Troy (Cassandra) and (Helenus). King Priam did invite Helen into the family and the trojan war began, I the book you will discover the heartbreaking story of 2 women who meet during the 6 years of war."
1,Harry Potter(J.K. Rowling) v.s. this book(Clemence McLaren),"Harry Potter, Or inside the walls of Troy. Which is better? To me Harry Potter is better, but I am not reviewing that book. Inside the walls of Troy, an interesting book, and fun filled with minimal action. This book waas otay, but she should have kept the story to Helen. I didn't like Cassandra's story too much, it was boring. Also, there was a typo in the book. It said there was korn imported from asia minor, but really there wasn't. Some parts of the book were good. And I semi-liked that Theseus part. If she put two sections, she should have made a mans view and a womans view. The cover was kool, and dat illustrator did a good job. I liked the book(a little). They should have described the attire of the peeps more. The girls bak then wore toppless clothes but Clemence did not described that. Ok. Kool."
3,"Good ideas, not the best execution...","We've heard the male version of the Trojan War for centuries. What about the women involved? How did Helen feel? What would it have been like to be Cassandra and have to watch your brothers head off into battle? The author takes you there. While personally I believe she could have included even more viewpoints of other women, and switched back and forth between Helen and Cassandra, the author opted to start with Helen's life as a child and switch to Cassandra's viewpoint after Helen arrives in Troy. While many would think this would make the book a bit unbalanced, it actually works quite well, as we see Cassandra's feelings towards Helen greatly change over the many years Troy is under siege. Overall, a pretty enjoyable read."
4,Great analysis of the politics of sex,"A cogent, straightforward presentation of the politics that lead to an extreme group's ascent to power within the feminist ranks. It's the first time I've actually understood the motivation, hysteria, and history of sex in relation to women's rights and both conservative and feminist ideology. McElroy offered reasonable definitions and actual information from women within the porn industry - much of it opposite the views being offered by women and men ""defending"" them. Very, very interesting and easy reading."
5,Great toy,"My 2 1/2 year old son really loves this toy. He loves to pick up the cargo with Cranky and then drop it in a basket or somewhere else. He also uses it to pick up his other trains since the magnet picks up the connections on the front and back of the trains. He doesn't have any trouble using it and it made a great addition to his Thomas train set. That being said, this is our second Cranky the Crane. We gave him one for Christmas and had to return it. The top part of the Crane disconnected from the base when my son picked it up. It was defective and our new Cranky doesn't seem to have this problem."
3,Super Fun but Needs Stabilzation,"Such a fun toy, but beware that it doesn't function very well on it's own.My husband attached some track on each side of Cranky and then screwed it down to our train table to make it more stable.Strong magnet and works very smoothly, just a little tippy."
2,Body Sculpt,"So I purchased this video thinking it would be modern and fun (look at the cover) and was quite surprised when I turned on the DVD... talk about 1980s! The people used ""canned"" goods as weights and I don't even want to get into what they were wearing!"
3,very nice,"As others have mentioned, this book is an encyclopedia and as such contains mostly facts. The stories and legends mentioned in the book are briefly surmised. The pictures are all in black and white. Most beings mentioned in the book are not pictured. Having no other similar book to compare this to, I'd say it's pretty complete. I've never heard of most of the creatures listed. I did find a few beings missing that I think are important and sometimes there are multiple entries for the same subject, under different and sometimes very similar names.This book would be useful as a reference for a research paper and is a nice addition to anyone's library."
5,"""Einstein in Love""","After reading the love letters written between Einstein and Mileva, how could I pass this book up? Reading it garners insight into two of the premier minds and hearts of science. I'm hoping it goes down in history as a tale of star-crossed, if not ill-fated lovers, the world they both hid from, and the world they created. It is a very special read, filled with poignancy, love, and eventual disillusionment in the story of their daughter. It's an unusual story, about two very unusual people, and definitely worth reading."
4,Good book for reference,Its a quick reference book if you don't want to haul around your large heavy textbook with you to the ICU during clinical. It doesn't include any additional information separate from the large textbooks tho. Helpful when you are first being introduced to critical care. The senior nursing students at my school however don't use theirs any more because the information eventually becomes common knowledge. I compared mine to the new version that is available (this one is just a little bit older than the newer one) and the information is almost exactly the same. So save your money and buy this version instead of the newer expensive version.
3,Lacking in substance from a programmer's perspective,"Although the book does contain some ""real world"" examples, it lacks in real substance on the language of PHP. The examples are trivial at best. It would've been more worth the money had the author provided more depth to the use of presented functions, as well as included additional language structure specifications.If this book is geared for TRUE web professionals (ie: programmers that want to know limitations), the author should have included information that is pertinent to professional development. Instead, the author chose to punt and let the white papers located on the PHP website handle those issues."
4,Good for beginner to intermediate level,The book is well written and easy to read with good graphics for a beginner level user. It did not provide the information I was searching for. The program is very intuitive to use as the book shows. I wanted to learn how to develop my own templates and stencils. I have not been able to find a clear explanation anywhere as how to do this. I mainly use Visio Home because it has more residential type stencils provided with it. I've wanted to import those stencils into Visio Technical 5 and create custom ones for home planning type layouts. Someone needs to publish a good book that covers this subject clearly.
5,One of My All-time Favorite Albums,"Between Green and Blue may be David Helping's debut album (1997), but it sure sounds like the work of a mature musician. The multi-instrumental disc covers just about all the ground there is in symphonic electronica, along with its exquisite use of percussion, bass, and guitar -- from start to finish it's just captivating, moody, and mesmerizing. The aural landscapes that Helping creates get into your head and if you are not careful, you'll find yourself listening to this album over and over, just as I do. This is one for the all-time best list for its genre."
2,Not a great product.,I can't get used to this mouse. It's all over the place like a car with loose steering. It looks cool though.
1,re-make of candi's songs which are not the originial tunes,"this is todays version of candi staton's old classic tunes. i would not buy this one, im looking for the originals. i will have to buy the albums. i do love candi, but at least let us now that the songs are remakes,"
1,Very Bad quality,"When I received the shipment it had two chairs broken. Then I asked for the replacement and got them withing two weeks. At that point I was satisfied. After using the new chairs for two months, one of them broke again. It was neither mishandled nor hit by something. I do not think asking for replacement again will help any more. I'll suggest not to buy this product."
3,"Uplifting, heartwarming","I received this movie as a gift and will definitely watch it a couple of times. I just wish the romance between the brother-in-law and Dianne had been a little more apparent on her side during the film. Really, she seemed to almost dislike him at times, and never seemed to appreciate him the way she should have. The tension is there, but it just doesn't feel romantic on her part until the last fifteen minutes or so. Anyway, I agree with all the positive comments from the other viewers."
5,markers,These are awesome and I am so glad I did the subscribe and save...so I get another set about August and will have them for my Christmas ornaments I make.
4,The Ancient Roots of Wile E. Coyote,"This is a venerable book first having been published in 1956. Its continuing ready availability over sixty years later speaks to its importance in the field of mythology.Radin contributes the majority of the essays that make up the book and incorporates additional perspectives by Kerenyyi , Jung, and Stanley Diamond. Included are in depth studies of the Winnebago Trickster and Hare Cycles as well as summaries of the Assiniboine and Tlingit Trickster myths.The picture that emerges of the Native American expression of this pervasive archetype is comprehensive, deeply researched, and yet very accessible. It will be of value to students of cultural anthropology, as well as those of comparative religion and psychology.In addition, however, and more unexpectedly it's also an interesting and entertaining read for the layperson.Be forewarned though - no mention of the road runner is to be found."
2,Lacking,"The video isn't very good. There is no sound whatsoever. There is all kinds of unfitting music dubbed over and no voice. I know this isn't supposed to be a porno, but there should be some sound. It gets boring"
2,DVD review,When we watched this Playboy tales of erotic fantasies I didn't think it was all that the description led it to be.
2,Waste of Money,"Don't waste your money on this thing. If you do fondant cakes, and you're a hobbyist, it's easier to roll your fondant on the counter with a little crisco underneath. The counter doesn't slide around like this dumb thing, or crease. And if you're an aspiring pro, you can do much better - buy a silicone fondant mat. More expensive, but worth it, since you won't be wasting money trying this thing. Seriously - go with something else."
5,EXCELLENT CD,EXCELLENT AND IT WILL DEFINITELY TAKE YOU BACK. WAS WEIRD NOT HEARING PROFESSOR X VOICE INSTEAD SOMEONE ELSE WAS HIS VOICE. OTHER THAN THAT I ENJOYED IT
1,Solaray quercetin QBC Plex,this brand of quercetin does not work for me - I have used Now Brand and Doctors Best and they both help me a lot. I have chronic allergies and quercetin does help me immensely - like a miracle for me - BUT NOT THE SOLARAY BRAND - so people stick with the other brands of quercetin - also I have skin allergies and quercetin helps with skin allergies too - so yes I can recommend quercetin just NOT the Solaray QBC Plex product - now of course everyone's system is different
4,ADJUSTABLE BASKETBALL HOOP,"Great price, fast shipping, Ability to follow an asset.Product -- Everything good but backboard a little week for rebounds. As well sounds like your hitting a large drum on the rebounds. Other than that I am totally satisfied!!!Thank you."
1,I've Been Mounted,"Stupid beyond belief. Ewoks with the technological equivilant of... well, Ewoks, have successfully invaded Earth and forced us to become their horses. There is no mention of what they did to real horses."
3,"drool-worthy writing, keenly powerful brain","Few books in recent memory can rival this novel's breathtaking, acrobatically adept use of language. On the sentence-for-sentence level, TEOLB reminded me a lot of Jonathan Lethem's Fortress of Solitude -- a book that made me want to stop and savor each paragraph as poetic work of art.I agree with other reviewers here, though, that this book's storyline is ultimately too obtuse. As a result, my interest in the book waned, and I found myself guiltily skimming through certain sections. Those of you who were simultaneously amazed and a little bored by David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest will likely have the same experience here: It's that feeling of marveling at an author's inventiveness and linguistic dexterity, while at the same time wishing they had provided more straightforward story to sink your teeth into.I'm putting my money on her third book being a masterpiece."
2,Not-So-Self Inflating,"I haven't taken this mat camping yet...and may never do so! After it arrived I tested out the magical ""self-inflating"" properties - it definitely takes quite a long time to even partially inflate. I had to huff & puff into the vents to inflate it fully, and when I laid down on it I heard a distinct whoosh of escaping air. It's also not particularly comfortable - gives good support to upper back, but my butt was on the ground, and I'm a very small person. Think I will stick to my good old yoga-mat style bedroll."
1,Hard night's sleep,"I purchased this self -inflating sleep mat for a week long canoe (BWCA) trip last August. (Because of the Great price). (The rest of the family was on thermarests).On the first night of the trip it inflated fine - but was very uneven and uncomfortable. After about 4 hours it ""popped"", all the air leaked out, and I found myself sleeping on the rocky ground. This made for a very uncomfortable week!!! Tried contacting the company upon my return home - but no luck. Will not buy this product again.I've had 2 Thermarests since 1985 and never had a problem with them. I'm ordering another Thermarest today for our next trip!"
1,horrible,"This is a horrible product not only does it not inflate, I blew it up and then it popped. I weigh 160 pounds. I am very unhappy."
5,Great Singer!,I've always just loved this womans voice! This is a great cd and I am getting ready to purchase no. 2If You are a wendy james fan...you won't be dissappointed!
5,Beautiful Collection,This is a beautiful collection of prayers with great information and beautiful illustrations. Miracles await.
1,Bad part listing,The part listing had alot of differnt cars listed tht the bolts would work with but it was very wrong i had to send the bolts back and get parts from the dealer at $16 a pop so do the math $16 x 10 i had to charg my costumer alot more than i quoted i ended up eating the cost in the long run.
3,So so book,"I ordered several books about the C5 Corvette when I purchased my 2001 Corvette and joined a Corvette Club last fall. This one is OK but there are better books out there. If I hadn't read ""All Corvettes Are Red"" first I would have enjoyed this one more. Get it if you are buying several Corvette books but don't make it your first choice.Charles"
2,Did not meet my expectations,"I purchased this product because I thought it would be better than using a mop on my vinyl flooring. I was wrong. This machine does not dry vacuum well. It blew the dirt, etc. around instead of sucking it up. The wet side works for a while, then before I can get all my vinyl flooring done, the suction stops working. I read on the bissell website that this could be due to the fact that the filter is wet. Duh! The filter is going to get wet! I also had problems with water squirting out of the dirty water tank while I was dry vacuuming. I had high hopes for this product. I could vacuum and mop with heated water with one machine. This product was a waste of money. I will go back to my mop until I find something that works better. I gave it two stars because the idea of using one machine to vacuum and mop is a good concept but this product needs some fine tuning."
2,"If you have animals, don't get this for hair removal!","I was so excited after reading the other people's reviews. I read about the Swiffer and how it would ""leak."" This one doesn't leak. One good point. It just doesn't get up the the debris first -- before you mop. I have three dog's and they, ugh, shed. Another item that's a complete rip off to those of you in my predicament, is the ""Shed Ender."" It doesn't end it. If any of you out there have a solution to my dilemma, I'd be most appreciative. If you don't have a solution and hope this is it, DON'T!"
5,My Son Loves his Bed!,"My Son loves his new bed. Cars is his favourite movie and he races to bed now. Great bed, Stickers are a pain but if you do it slowly it looks amazing. The gaps on either side of the twin mattress are a disapointment but we went out and bought plywood to put underneath the mattress so his toys don""t fall down under the bed.I give this bed a 5 star even though we don't like a few things about it. My son loves the bed and to me that is worth 5 stars."
4,Great!!! But only in English...,"This set of DVDs of the 4th season are great. Bam Bam was introduced into the series. As the previous 3 seasons the image and sound quality are very considering these are from the 60's. The only thing that prevents this 4th season to be 5 stars is that it did not have the Spanish and French language as the previous seasons. For those of us that were used to Betty call Barney ""cuchi cuchi"", is not the same experience. I hope this is fixed for the 5th season. The Flintstones are fun in any language but, if the spoken language is Spanish it will be better."
1,Not interested,"I was originally very excited to learn about the ""taggies"" products. My daughter loves the tags on all her toys, so I thought she'd love it. Nope. She's picked it up maybe twice. She was more interested in the REAL tag on the taggie than the tags that are part of the design. It just sits at the bottom of her toybox."
1,Not so good,We were not happy with this Panettone at all. It was extremely dry and not what we have had from other brands in the past. We have had much better from less expensive breads. Would not purchase again.
3,Is your man a commitment phob?,"She describes several types of men that are commitment phobs and whether or not they will ever commit and some ideas of moving them toward commitment. Turns out my last guy was a ""casual dater"" and basically there's nothing I can do about that. Had I read ""Make up, don't Break Up"" I would have known not to confront him about dating others (since I was willing to deal with it at this point in time anyway) and just casually date him back we would probably still be together, but would he ever commit? Who knows!?If you follow ""The Rules"" you will end up ignoring the ""commitment phobs"" anyway."
2,Okay,This movie was not that funny. Mainly the did not show his belly as much as they should have. The movie is dry for modern times.
3,Bernard Jensen Liqui Dulse 1 oz,"I just started with this product a couple weeks ago- Borrowed my daughter's till mine arrived, but I wanted to support my thyroid and I am noticing better sleep which I have had an ongoing issue with long waking periods in the middle of the night. Zzzzzzzzzzzz...... ;o)"
2,This video is GREAT!!! For a 10 year old kid.,"If you are 10 years old or younger and interested in philosophy, psychology, or anything else related to them, get this movie. but if you are at least a little bit smarter than the average bear this movie is just a flashback of all of the views you had when you were 10. This 30 minute movie is just leary rambling on and sounds like an overly drunk redneck.Such as the following statement made by him:""Oh say can you see....Oh say CAN'T you see what is happening to your eyes."" After which he goes on to ramble about how the media is controlling what you see through the t.v.It is just a bunch of things like this that he keeps on saying and repeating himself over and over and over again. As long as you have a brain you REALLY dont need this video to show you how to use it."
1,Much TOOOOOO Long,"The premise of this story is original, and parts of it are wonderful. There are some pages of beautifully written prose - and THEN more pages of On-and-On-and-On...... The authors told me MUCH more than I needed (or wanted) to know. The Golden Rule of good writing is: ""Show - don't tell"". Maybe the authors were absent on the day that was taught in writing class. With some ruthless good editing and pruning - this COULD have been a 5 star book."
5,Tomb Raider Legend Guide,"Hi, I'm a lover of Tomb Raider. I've played many of the Tomb Raider games. The last one out; Legend, is very fun and even better then the tomb raider games before. The other Tomb Raider games gave you a phone number to call incase you got stuck. Tomb Raider Legend does not have that. Your best bet is to get Tomb Raider:Legend:The Complete Official Guide. This way you will not miss anything and if you can't figure something out and you've spent hours on it, you can cheat and find out how to do whatever it is you're trying to do or get through. Before purchasing the book I was told of a few different web sites where I could find answers to my questions I have about Legend. Unfortunately, that did not work for me. I'm very happy to have purchased The Complete Official Guide, for Tomb Raider Legend. It's made the game much more enjoyable, even more so than it already was!Tomb Raider: Legend: The Complete Official Guide"
2,Disappointing,"I ordered two of these units. The first one that I installed didn't work. The battery that came with this unit was dead. I replaced the battery but it still didn't work. I uninstalled the first unit and installed the second. The battery with the second unit was also dead. I replaced the battery and it works, but not every time you press the switch. The switchplate also serves as the switch as it bends to press on the activation button. When it's pressed it sometimes doesn't work right away. All in all the switch sending unit seems flimsy. The light socket receiving unit appears to be adequate. Good idea; but, it needs more work."
3,Limited sucess,"I purchased two of these wireless light sockets, one of them quit working after about 30 minutes. The other one seems to be fine and has been working for a month now. The defective socket was returned to the manufacturer for a replacement but haven't heard back yet."
5,Best Yet!!!!!,"Paul and Annie, an asset to acoustic blues have released another scorcher. They are like a great wine, maturing with taste over time.This is the best sounding yet, ""Keep Your Hands Off Her"", would have made Leadbelly Proud. This sticks out as my favorite.Annie's harmonica is brilliant as always blazing new tonal pathways for our ears to explore and enjoy. Not to Sloppy on the mando either.Where in the past some of the mix has been mired in reverb, all the notes are clear and concise, letting us hear the masterful interplay between the two artists.I spent a few years in Boston as a harp player and had the pleasure to sit in on a few tunes with Paul at the Sit and Bull in Maynard. It was always a pleasure just to sit and listen, but to play with a musician of such genius made a young harp players dream come true.Glad to have you guys back!"
2,So-so,I agree with other reviewers - not very sturdy at all. Don't use it for your favorite piece of crystal or wine glass trying to watch TV!
3,Hope this one is different from white one I bought at Walgreens,"I bought a white version of this table at Walgreens and it does not have a setting that makes it level. It only adjusts too high or too low at the front edge. Admittedly it has a little ledge at the side closest to you but for sitting a drink on, it is a little precarious. It does seem like they could have realized people would also eat and drink on this table not just read, do crafts and work on the computer."
3,Table-Mate Woodgrain Portable,It is a nice table and works for my laptop. I do not like the ridge around the table it is uncomfortable on my wrist. I would have preferred a flat edge.
3,Not what I expected.,Not as big as ones that I had before.(lost it in a fire) Don't think the cup holder is that great or necessary. Really like the color.
3,It is not very sturdy!,"I have to keep it, but will probably buy another that's more stable.I have my own that is sturdy and was much cheaper!"
3,"Purposeful, but quality needs improving.",Great carrier for a few pieces to grab-and-go! Zipper issues and started to show wear after a couple of months. Serves a purposes....just don't let it be too much.
5,"""I'll be dad burned""!","Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, Pixie and Dixie. You and your kids will love this.For those of you that are making fun of this John Q Public guy, take it easy on him. He is an angry midget that used to call in to the Howard Stern show named Gary the Retard."
3,"Really like the cartoon, but disappointed with the DVD","Having grown up in the '80s, I watched all the classics on Cartoon Network, and I have been collecting all the old HB cartoons on DVD. This is the first one I've gotten which disappointed me. I found it a little boring to see the same cartoon on multiple discs. I am sure there is more material that they could have put on them instead."
5,a little peace in todays enviornment,"From Global warming is harming the polar bears to turn off the water while you brush - how do we make sense of it all for our children. This is a fun festive way to provide awareness to arctic animals from the very young to the young at heart. Many children have questions and worries as to what happens to the animals in the winter weather. This will not only answer the questions in an upbeat fun way, but it will also provide more learning that they were not even aware of. There are fun festive songs to help keep interest, and the whole story is told from Santa's perspective. And at this price, how can you go wrong! The real animal footage gives us pictures we would never otherwise be able to observe. ( And no gory or graphic scenes to worry about if your child is very young.) This is a fun holiday DVD to add to your annual viewing collection."
4,Great Stories,"Being a comic book fan who has lost interest in the ""new"" post-Crisis Superman, I found these older stories to be lots of fun. A more honest and innocent hero, and a great flashback to my impression of the character when I was younger. A great peice of pop-history."
1,Into Food Fantasies?,"If you're into food fantasies, than this is the book for you. Unfortunately, I don't know which turns me off more -- pouring food on my partner or cleaning up the mess it makes. Judith Sachs spends COUNTLESS pages on food and masturbation fantasies. Very few pages are spent on how sex actually heals. My recommendation? If you want to learn about the positive aspects of sexual healing, listen to Marvin Gaye or read Alex Comfort."
4,Christmas gift for Mother-in-law,"This product was in excellent condition, but it took almost two weeks to arrive. I am not sure if that was due to it being the holiday season or what. But, overall I was very satisfied and would order from this person again."
4,"Awesome, and intellectually stimulizing!","I thought this book was great. When the character goes to jail for being accused of murder I was so upset, I almost didn't want to read anymore. But once you get past the part where she in in jail, the story takes you for a fun, adventurous rollar coaster that is put together so cleverly that it makes you wanting more before the end of the book. I loved it, and I'm passing it around to my friends."
5,Sid's the Best ..If Tomorrow Comes....,"Sidney's most intriguing Heroine and an imaginative plot - If Tomorrow Comes is all about Tracy Whitney 'My Love' who bubbles around merrily while you devour the book happily! Yeah, Sheldon is my top fav and I read all his books which are just great but this one is a page turner that never makes you stop reading again n again! Smashing, lovely Whitney faces hardship and revenge. Sid has efficiently portrayed the character of Tracy Whitney, the beautiful romantic woman, an idealistic who passed through trials in life. When her mom Dorris Whitney commited suicide, Sid express the emotions of Tracy deeply live all through the pages when Leiutenant Miller informs her and she reaches to find a note left by her mom! If Tomorrow comes is Sidney Sheldon's Best ever pick you can choose and enjoy the scoop of romance, money game, adventure, thrill and emotion."
3,Good but FAR from Sheldon's best...,"This good was good - yet it lacked...the ""who done it"" part - I love all of Sidney Sheldon's books so far - I've read 10 so far - and this one was just...I just didn't get excited about it. And I read what other people think about this book and I just think to myself WHY - HOW can someone say something that good about this book? My favourite Sheldon book is ""The Doomsday Conspiracy"" which was my first and it made me want to read them all - If I read this one first I wouldn't read any of his others. Giving this 3 stars is pushing it - I only gave it that much because it's Sidney Sheldon... Maybe it's because I'm 15 that made it not appeal to me a great deal. I don't particularly care for reading books with lesbian activity in them... But the beginning was interesting - the end was...alright - the middle had nothing...."
5,a gripping page turner,"This is the first book that I read by Sidney Sheldon and I was completely in awe of the scope of this story. Every twist in the plot had me turning pages late into the night simply because I was unable to put the book down. I was quite simply, riveted to the spot. The main character, Tracy, is someone that you come to care about and respect as she leads you a series of wild and unexpected adventures. Sheldon has created an intelligent, witty and captivating tale that will keep your jaw on the floor for days to come."
3,Persian Girls Just Want to have Fun ... at a Soccer Match,"This is an instructive peek into Iranian culture and the way women are treated in it. These rabid female soccer fans must disguise themselves as men to view a World Cup qualifying soccer match against Bahrain. Apparently women are not allowed, for a multitude of lame-oh reasons. The hypocrisy of the ""rationale"" of excluding women is skewered in OFFSIDE.Too bad the ACLU can't take on the Iranian powers that be. Maybe if we could only export some lawyers to Tehran, they might be begging for mercy faster than any economic or military sanctions could leverage.OFFSIDE scores its goal for portraying the second-class citizenship of women in Iran but also illustrates the unifying nature of sort, which can become an almost irrational source of nationalistic pride."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT!,"I got this from a recomendation of a friend of mine that used it to learn to play guitar. He said it was SO MUCH easier than the lessons we tried to take to learn to play, and he was RIGHT. It doesn't bore you with playing the same chord over and over and you can play along with the guys on the DVD in like 20 minutes. It's AWESOME. Quick and easy. I am one step closer to being famous! HA!"
3,Saw Arbor Length,"I purchased this blade with the purpose of using it on a Delta 10 inch table saw. What I found was that the arbor on my saw was not long enough to accomodate this type of dado blade. Delta should state either the minimum arbor length or model numbers that this blade will work on. In my case I had to go with a 6"" stack dado with the maximum cutting width of 1/2""."
3,disapointed,"I have not recieved the product yet.. would you call me and let me know, what is happening to my porchuse.thank youAshkan,702-326-3509"
3,So so fighting scenes but fails as a drama.,This is move is basically a drama with some action scenes. However it fails to be a touching drama. It does not move me.It depicts the love of a female demon for a general. She was a white fox who turned into a beautiful woman after hundred years of magic training. I can see how much the general's wife loved him but I don't feel the love between the general and the demon. I don't know it's because of the acting or directing.The demon buster's role is the silliest here. Her dialogues are childish. They make the film more like a comic book.The fighting scenes are so so. They're not the best of Donnie Yen. I prefer him in Flash Point and Iron Monkey.It's worth watching once because of Donnie Yen.
3,Donnie Yen,This Is A Donnie Yen MovieBut Not So GoodAlthough I Think He Is The BEST Around Right Now And I Don't Think It Gets Better Than DONNIE YEN
4,Surprisingly Feature Packed But Unmaintained Since 2004,"I will commend this distribution of Linux because of the amazing array of extremely useful applications it contains: Blender, Open Office, sodipodi, Gimp, Video Editor,Scribus and Ximian Evolution among others.But sadly, no one is keeping it up-to-date and the package updater is offline as well.As a free trial live CD it is one of the most excellent Linuxes I've ever used. Sure wish the good doctor would come back and rescue this great little linux..."
4,Getting another one,"I'm so happy with the one I have, I'm buying it again. I've had this for at least 5 years and it works great. It seems my blade may not be as sharp after 5 years of use so I thought I would pick up another to replace it. My wife bought me some fancy trimmer with all the attachments, and this one still works better. The vacuum really works, no mess in the sink. Its light, and I don't find it bulky, maybe the charger, but I only use it at home. Because of its shape, it's a little hard to get up under the nose to trim the top part of a moustache. If you wife complains about your hair in the sink, get this!"
1,Strange Document,"There are no copy right marks on this to show what time period it comes from.It appears to be a primer for people who want to know about witch's. It appears to be from the 1600's.I agree with the other review, it's not worth reading."
2,"Sorry, just not good.","Waste of money. Very disappointed in the music, the lyrics and just about everything else about this CD. Save your money ."
5,Great!,"Great pendant, unique shape. I am very happy to have acquired this pendant, it is one of the most beautiful items I own now. The other one is also acquired from Silver Insanity."
3,Is Deja Vu Worth it?,"This was a real disappointment. Having been a huge fan of Hitman 1 & 2, I was highly anticipating Contracts. What really confused me, was why IO/Eidos decided to remake most of Hitman 1. About 4 different missions in Contracts are remakes of the Hong Kong stages of the 1st game. Sorry, but when almost half the game is just a rip of the first, it just ruins the experience. In the end, what could have been a gem of a sequel, turned out to be a mediocre, seemingly rushed product that was way to short.Having played both 1 & 2, the gameplay hasn't improved all that much. Perhaps Tobias (47) moves slightly better. Changing weapons is annoying. Why Eidos didn't associate the mouse wheel for that is beyond me.Overall, Contracts is a worthy game for newcomers. But for veteran Hitman gamers, this is just a typical attempt to milk what's left in the franchise."
4,Hitman Contracts,This is the third installment in the Hitman series. In my opinion its probably the best out of the first 3. Its the only one I had a great time playing and it kept my interest long enough for me to actually finish the game.
2,Genius; or has he simply lost his grip?,"Mike Patton can sing, of that there is no doubt. I read other reviews about this album, and was warned that it was just a recording of voice. However, I am a musician myself, and have generally appreciated Patton's different slant on things. Knowing what he can do with his voice is what drew me in with this album.I am dissapointed.There is no theme; there is not even a melody.It's as though Patton got a hold of a digitech effects pedal and a microphone, and that's about as creative as he got. This album lacks imagination, production and creativity. Not even the most alternative minded individual will be able to relate even remotely to this collection of noises. It's not an album, but merely something you will put on your shelf and say to others 'I have it'."
1,Obnoxiously amusing,"Honestly, I think the only reason this album gets good reviews is because people think that if they like it they must be ""deep"" or ""artsy"" or ""intellectual."" The few redeeming moments on this horrendous CD are all but annihilated, buried beneath heaping mounds of obnoxious junk. I enjoy Mike Patton's work as much as the next person, but this...this is just a waste. This is not a display of talent or creativity, people. Anyone could have recorded this self-indulgent noise and called it art, but because it's Mike Patton that makes it something of value? I am going to have to disagree.If you must, listen to it once just to say you have. Otherwise, leave it alone. The only use this album could ever have is as a torture device."
1,Don't listen.,"It's either hip among young non-musicians to enjoy bad, overpriced music, or the others who bought this CD and recognized it for the low budget crap it is just didn't bother writing reviews. Maybe, like me, they felt ashamed after having their ears raped by Patton and his cheap four-track recorder (which was what he used to record every ""song""). This CD consists of Patton making slurpy, gurgly, screechy, and fart-like noises into a microphone. That's it. There's no accompanying music or lyrics. It's unequivically lame, and I'm surprised the record company agreed to release it; I guess they were counting on that I'll-listen-to-anything-that's-weird, wanna-be-avant-garde demographic."
2,"Good problem identification, but poor solutions.","The book starts off with a good analysis of the problem -- society's dependence on computers and the rapid evolutionary pace of technology (and the slow evolutionary pace of human beings in absorbing this glut of information). However, a large portion of the book focuses on the effects of technology on politics. This is not very useful for someone who is trying to survive the information glut in everyday work and home environments. Then it ends with simplistic solutions, which are ways to reduce data overload (such as turning off the TV)."
5,They way 'Punk' should be.,"This is truly 'punk' as I grew up to know it. Political, meaningful, sincere, considered and full of energy. Information on Judi Barry and lots of great lyrics to sing in the factory. This one is for all the wage slaves and people concerned with the hegemony of white, corporate politics. GET IT."
2,Summary Combination of Book Reviews,"Thought it will be a keystone to my explortion to this field, however, as it is actually a summary of 13 books regarding suicidology, no offense, it's really not the right book for one who's seeking an introductory work, at least for me. I might turn back to the book after building some knowledge, years after."
3,A VERY crowded plot,"When I first began to watch the television series derived from R.D. Wingfield's ""Frost"" books, I worked under the assumption that there must have been quite a few books from which to work, as each episode had a nicely filled-out plot, particularly during the first two series.This is not true. There have been only a few books, but Wingfield conspires to stuff his plots so efficiently that the writers of the television show merely had to remove bits and pieces of the books to create the episodes.This book inspired two of the best episodes of the first series; CONCLUSIONS (the night-club robbery, the hit-and-run-case, the bank robbery, and the murdered policeman) and NOTHING TO HIDE (the dead junkie in the public restroom). Frost himself remains a much less sympathetic fellow on page than screen, but Wingfield conspired to make him an amusing sort of swine, so it isn't nearly as annoying as one might expect . . ."
2,A Stereotypical SnoreFest!,"I found this book to be very difficult to get ""into"". The characters were not interesting, the descriptions were overkill and the author treated the Chinese culture quite stereotypically, especially in her dialogue sections. I was disappointed with the book and only finished it because my library book group was reading it. It definitely was not worth the time."
2,Thin paper.,"It fits, but quality is way below of the original vacuum bags. This is like a white sandwich bag unlike the thick, durable vacuum bag that came with the airway sanitizor."
4,A Review for Little Boy Lost,"This book shows you how bleak France was after the world war. The idea is very realistic and the characters are well thought up. The main character-Hilary-has lost his son. His wife died in France and the boy as left in the care of her close friend, Jean. But Jean was killed and the boy lost. Hilary gets a visit from Pierre who was in love with Jean who says that he would like to look for Hilary's son. So Pierre goes and looks for the boy after the war and Hilary joins him. When Pierre thinks that he has found the boy, Hilary goes to see him and gets mixed feelings about him. But in the end Hilary has to make a decision and it is a decision that will change his life."
5,The Meanings Behind Idioms,"Fantastic resource for more than 600 idioms that we might use; but never stopped to figure out where they came from. As with any dictionary, the idiom dictionary is setup alphabetically by the first word in the phrase. Each explanation starts with an example use of the idiom, phrase or expression. Followed by the meaning in simple terms. Finally, each entry has the origin from which the idiom came from. All of this information is concisely put together. Students and adults alike with enjoy this useful tool. Elementary school kids (2nd+) will laugh with amusement; and then begin to use the idioms in their own writing and conversations.Pairs nicely withEven More Parts."
2,A bit disappointing!,"I had thought this book would be great for my scouting son, but was disappointed in its content. It has some funny anecdotes, but not as much nor as amusing as what you can read in any Scouting magazine."
5,Still gettig Better,"One thing about Fountain of Wayne there is no let down. Their CD's get betterGood lyrics with the good sense of humor from songs ""92 Subaru"", ""Yolanda Hayes"" ,""Revolving Dora"", ""Hotel Majestic"" and ""Planet Of Weed""Catchy melodies in ""Traffic and Weather"", ""Someone to Love"", ""Strapped For Cash"" and ""New Routing"" with good harmonies in songs ""Fire In The Canyon"", ""This Better Be Good"", ""I-95"" and ""Seatbacks And Traytables""All together make this an excellent CD which I would highly recommend."
4,"Enjoyable, fun, 70s classic pop/rock","As someone whose only prior exposure to FOW was ""Stacy's Mom"", this album has been a pleasant surprise. The songs are well-crafted - this isn't garage band rough stuff - with catchy hooks, and lots of ""hey!"", ""yeah!"" and ""ba-ba-da-ba-ba-baaahs"". Even with the 70/80s era synths layered on many of the tracks, the guitar work and drum production give the album an up-to-date, fresh sound.If tongue-in-cheek lyrics, simple melody lines sung over a bedrock of guitars and drums are your thing, you should check out ""Traffic and Weather"". Favorite tracks: ""'92 Subaru"", ""Yolanda Hayes"", ""Someone to Love"" and ""Traffic and Weather"".If You Like cross-reference: Rockpile, Nick Lowe, Badfinger, The Beatles, Grand Funk Railroad"
3,Their first slip up.,"""Traffic And Weather"" (2007) #97.FOW's 4th studio album ""Traffic And Weather"", is their first slip up. After 3 terrific albums, ""TAW"", has just to much filler, of the 14 songs only, ""Someone To Love"", the fun ""92 Subaru"", ""Fire In The Canyon"", ""Hotel Majestic"" and ""New Rotation"" hit the spot. They rebound on 2011's ""Sky Full Of Holes""."
4,Ripley's back - or is she?,"Talk about making the best of a bad job! This book is definitely - no offence to the scriptwriter, Joss Whedon - an improvement on the screenplay. In the film there are some gaps you could put the Titanic through, but the book fills them in admirably. Alien3, in my opinion, detracted from the sweep of Aliens, but Alien: Resurrection redeems the series somewhat, and the novelisation is an epic in itself. A.C. Crispin and Kathleen O'Malley, I salute you."
5,"love, love, love","Admittedly it takes a few listens to fall in love with this CD. My absolute favorite track is ""Gone"". Everything about this song is great. It's full of emotion, but in a subtle way. I guess that's what I would say about most of the songs on this album. They all seem to have some sort of hidden message and most of the songs have a really powerful lyric or two that really puts everything into perspective. Brandi's voice is impeccable, I love it. It's full of soul and emotion. It really is incredible. I can't wait to see her live. Overall, I think this is a great CD. Some songs are stronger than others, but they are all very listenable. I gave it 5 stars, just because it's the best CD I've listened to in a long time and also because I really believe that people will enjoy it."
4,Amazing talent,"Though not as polished as ""The Story"" this album feels fresh and young but with all the unmistakable quality that you would expect from Carlile. Fantastic voice that is so stirring you can't help but be in awe of it. She is an amazing talent that spans genres and generations."
5,Please buy this album.,"Wonderful album. I can't describe how much this album explains exactly how I feel about life, but it is also a musical masterpiece. Short and sweet, no song is over 4:30. Perfectly EQed, and can you believe this girl is only 23?! I see good things to come for Brandi, keep a close eye."
1,Avoid,"Terrible product. Loose capsules that do not stay closed. More importantly, looks nothing like the other green tea extracts I have. No noticeable energy effect. I am inclined to say they are selling sand in a capsule. Stick with USP certified products."
4,Ruth Wind has a plus-size heroine....,"and that makes the book worth wild! I loved all the characters from Ruth's short story even the character of the baby. I just wish it was longer. I also enjoyed Madeline Baker's short story and will check out her other novels. I learned things about Native American culture from Baker's story and I want to learn more! Kathleen Eagle's story didn't do anything for me and I couldn't finish that story. Yet, I would recommend this book. You're bound to like one of these short stories."
3,Ear warmer,"I originally bought this item for myself. However when I tried it on I did not like the tight feel of the fit. Since I am prone to headaches anyway, I did not think it was the right product for me. I gave it to my boyfriend and he liked it very much, especially that it folds up very compact so he could have it with him at all times and not worry about being out in the cold without a hat. So there was a happy ending after all, just not for me."
4,Good Printer,"This is a good printer-period. It does what I want it to do, and I have been fortunate enough to not deal with any paper jams or any other problems. I got this printer for free from bulk purchases from Dell, so I can't say that it is worth the full price asked for here, but it is a good printer. The network feature is nice, but I haven't had too much use for it. If I was really looking to purchase a printer around this price, I would probably try to get a Canon Pixma MX850 (all in one and quick prints), but you can't go wrong with a dependable laser printer."
4,Traditional construction paper.,"This is a pad of traditional construction paper. It comes in eight colors, (green, red, pink, yellow, black, blue, white, orange). The only thing I do not like about this paper is that the papers must be removed from the pad with care or they will ""tear"" rather than separating along the bound edge; I have to tear them out for my young child."
5,Bought it.... then loved it,"Well i bought this CD b/c of the song ""Gun in Hand"" then i discovered that there are about 8 songs on the CD that are just as good if not better then it. so yeah this CD is a must have... get on the bandwagon before everyone else. this band is going to be huge. seriously"
3,PC-Cillin Rates Okay,I have been using Internet Security 2005 for all my computers and decided to try something different with a better rating so I bought this PC-Cillin for my son. It had a great rating. I found the installation to be pretty easy. It is after installing this software I found that registering this product was pretty difficult. There are 4 steps that are required to complete in order for the software to be fully installed. It is pretty confusing. I also could not load some of them because my son could not get on lots of web-site such as IM. I would rate this software okay because I don't feel it is user friendly.
4,Solid Critique of the Faith/Prosperity Movement,"In this book, the author presents a strong critique of the faith/prosperity movement. Although the critique comes across as somewhat harsh, the author's points all appear to have a solid scriptural basis. The author examines the key theology of the faith preachers and rebuts it point by point. He also looks at some of the leading preachers in the movement and points out the errors in their teaching according to the Bible. The book is a valuable resource for those that have friends or family involved in the movement. My only concern with the book is that it did not leave much room for grace for those involved in the faith movement--and it seemed unnecessary to refer to it as a cult. Otherwise, it's a worthwhile book that does a necessary duty of pointing out error in a portion of today's church. Maybe the author would next consider taking on the emergent church movement."
4,Interesting Book,"Finally, someone was brave enough to tackle this subject matter. This exposition of the Word Faith Teachers was something that needed to be done years ago. I can sum the review up in one word BULLSEYE! Hank has hit the target"
5,Truth?,"After sitting in class where Hank Hanegraaff spoke I have read his works. As the Bible Answer man he has helped solve many problems for people. This book was updated for this generation. And he exposes a lot about many of the pastors and ministries that are influencing people today.He as always uses scripture to back up any claims and errors that he sees in modern culture. We have so many teaching false doctrines and leading people astray. We must discern the truth about what they are teaching.From cults. prosperity, and healers Hanegraaff deals with them very well without being to judgmental. I really think this is a must read for anybody wanting not to be lead astray and help those who are being drawn to false teachers."
4,Arthritis and common sense,"I like the book, even though there are things I dont agree with. I'm trying this treatment and hope it wil work. What I ask myself if they're still in use or they proved wrong presently."
4,"COOL, But its missing Brandmeier's ""ONCE AGAIN""","A GOOD CD!But where is the song ""ONCE AGAIN"" Its a good CD but I heard a song the other night on DAWSON'S CREEK and it was AWESOME...I think it was called ""ONCE AGAIN"". I read on the Dawson's Creek website that it was by an artist by the name of Michael Brandmeier. So I bought the CD, on Amazon, and it was EVEN MORE AWESOME. So this is a good CD and if you want even more great music, check out the Dawson's artist above. It resonates to the core. VERY DEEP and SOOO very catchy are the tunes..I hope it makes it on DAWSON'S #2 along with more tracks off his CD!! Great Job Dawson's & Michael!!"
3,No World Party and no Edwin McCain!,"I'm very disappointed to see that Edwin McCain didn't make it onto the CD--it was Dawson's Creek that launched that song in my opinion! I'm also sad to see that World Party's ""She's the One"" didn't make it on--when I heard that song in the episode where Pacey starts liking Joey--I TRACKED DOWN the artist (World Party)and bought it just for that song!"
3,Songs,"This CD has some great songs on it, But I really would have liked to see ""Kiss the rain"" By Billie Myers."
3,Not as good as I expected...,"I made the decision to buy this soundtrack based on a previous purchase of music from the show Felicity, which I enjoyed very much. I was disappointed that the music wasn't very good on the Dawson's Creek CD. Maybe it's been too long since I've seen the show."
4,Pretty good.,"I thought that the Dawson's creek album was pretty good. I would not say that i was amazed by its excellence - but it is definitly worth a listen. Paula Cole's song is brilliant, but there are a few duff ones on there too! Anyway, generally, i would say that if you are at all a fan of the show - buy it!"
4,A Good Companion to the Show,"I think the best songs on here aren't even the *Hits* (for example ""Kiss Me"" and ""London Rain"") The little extras, like ""Cry Ophelia"" and ""Feels Like Home"" are the stand outs on this CD. I was sad to see many of the TV Show's featured songs left out, such as ""I'll Be"", ""All I Want"", but I guess this CD makes up for it. Even though I don't watch the show anymore, I still enjoy the CD, not as *soundtrack* but as a simply good CD of songs."
5,Makes me happy!,"This is an excellent feel good cd. I'm in Saudi Arabia working and forgot to bring this with me!! I'm having it posted out as we speak!! I really miss it. I think it will mean more to people who have watched the show, but the songs are so good that anyone who hasn't watched the show will still love it."
2,sugar coated,"What happened when the producers of this record decided what musicshould go on it. Did they forget that great songs by the Goo Goo Dolls,Hole and New Radicals were also featured in the series. Apparantly so, because all you find on this CD are the series most forgetable tracks. The only decent tracks on the album are by Paula Cole, Curtis Stigers, and Shooter. Dissapointing with a capital ""D""."
1,This CD is a joke!,"I'd just like to say that this CD is absolutely a waste of time. None of these songs are the ones the public wants to hear... what about the theme songs, 'Save Tonight', 'Kiss the Rain' and 'Say Goodnight'? Unless WB does something about this CD, no one is going to buy this!"
1,why?!!,I really would like to know why most of the soundtracks are not on there and we have to buy it separately?!!!
4,Should have been a DOUBLE CD...,"Although its good, there are a number of songs missing on there I've heard on the show, one being a song, called ""ONCE AGAIN"", by an artist named Michael Brandmeier. I got the info off of this artist off the DAWSON'S website, and this song and a TON more off this CD ""SPIRIT ON THE RUN"" DEFINITELY should be on or at least on #2. The DAWSON'S CD is very cool and I do hope they come out with #2. I will buy it. But a greater surprise is this brandmeier's CD 'SPIRIT ON THE RUN."" It is just awesome, EVERY song. Thanks DAWSON'S for allowing these artists to come to the fore-front..The Sherlock HOLMES FOR GREAT NEW MUSIC..."
5,One of the most moving autobiographies I have ever read.,"This may be the only book I have ever read where I wanted to contact the author and let her know how much her story had moved me. A genuine love story . . . one that left me awash in tears by the time I finished (which was uncomfortable because I was sitting on a beach surrounded by people)! I have recommended this book time and time again to my friends, who wind up thanking me for the loan (and, to date, I've always gotten the book back -- which makes me quite happy)! Marion Winik has a wonderful ""voice,"" a sincere ability to convey emotions without concern that others will sit in judgment . . . I have become quite a fan."
1,First Comes Love,"I'm disgusted I ever bought this book and would love to have my money back (someone in my book club chose it). All nine members of my book club HATED this book and found Marion Winik's actions/addictions disgusting. She offers no explanation for her self-absorbed, destructive behavior. I promptly gave it away after I read it (not to the library...doesn't belong in a respectable institution like that). Her actions that are documented in this ""memoir"" are despicable and could have had life-threatening ramifications on innocent children. Do not waste your money or your time."
1,"Too much, presuming too much pre-knowledge",The title says it all. I have basis Spanish but could not make use of this program which appears written for native Spanish Speakers.
5,A masterpiece,"This is the most convincing Iron Mask theory so far proposed. The author looks at all the earlier theories and comes to the conclusion that all of them share the same general weakness: they have to dismiss some of the known facts in order to make sense. What's to be done with all the loose ends? John Noone solves the riddle masterfully and in a totally original way, managing to present the solution almost as a conjuror's trick: when the end of the book is a few pages away, it seems that the author has gotten nowhere with his debunking of the old theories, when suddenly it turns out that the new solution has been staring the reader in the face. But aside from all the detection, it is also a masterpiece of historical writing, elevating the genre to something like a Borgesian fable. It establishes all the facts and then transcends them in order to get to the truth. If this is not history, it's what history should be."
4,Great reissue by Columbia,"With great sound, good linear notes and an incredible program, with all the alternate takes you'll want. Now, Duke never recorded the original 'Black Brown and Baige' complete, so this is only an excerpt. He only played it complete a couple of times, being the most notable the Carnegie Hall in 1943. I own this Columbia release, the 1943 live version in Carnegie Hall and the RCA version recorded before the Columbia. To me, the best is the RCA version, mainly because of the good sound quality and Johnny Hodges on Come Sunday and the incredible track ""the Blues"", which is missing on this version. The RCA version can be obtained in 'the complete mid forties recordings', one of the best collections of Ellington in the market."
3,A Question,"As a football fan, I enjoyed this book. As an athlete, I was more than a little disturbed, if what Dr. Huizenga says is true. But I have one question: Why did he wait so long to write this book? It seems a little odd to me that he waited until after he had a thriving practice, and a nasty split from the team to 'do the right thing'. I think for the players at least, this book should have been written much earlier. Dr. Huizenga has brought much needed attention to the abuse of trust one person places in another. He also shows that it's okay to stick your neck out. Well, not too far out. At least until your student loans are paid."
3,you're OK - it's only a bruise,"Not a bad read at all- I thought there would be more about the actual Raiders antics, but there was a lot of insightful information around the struggle between the Doctors and internal politics of an Al Davis teamOverall had some good parts and some funny parts as well. Very good inside information from the authors perspective around the use of Steroids and the ulimate death of Lyle Alzado...."
4,1/6th is missing? BOO.,"Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned the missing episode. I was automatically going to purchase this set, but only five of the six episodes are included? Now I'll wait until they release a Region 1 Series 2 set and hope to have the missing episode included there. If not, my VHS tapes will have to satisfy the completist urge."
2,Blind Justice in search of a plot,"There is simply no credible plot in this already very thin story. There are occasional glimpses of humor and interesting content, but as a whole the books falls flat because it is just too lacking in plot and character development. It reminds me of the books for teenagers that I used to read as a youngster. The plots were often marked by facile manipulation, but I read them with fascination because every development was interesting. Grown-up readers should expect a lot more from a lawyer-thriller."
5,Stellar Series Video Table,"This product is just perfect for the new Mitsubishi 82"" tv. It is well built and looks great with the 82"" tv. Easy to assemble and is very sturdy. If you arelooking for a stand for your big screen this is the one, great price on Amazon, I had it shipped at no charge. This is the only reasonable priced stand that willfit the Mitsubishi 82"", Mitsubishi does not make a stand for the 82""."
2,Works well but way uncomfortable.,"I will agree with that other review that states this headset is uncomfortable. The ear cushions are fine, but the frame presses into my head quite hard. I added some padding which helped, but it is still a poor design. I can't complain about the function though. Mic is clear and sound quality is good for my purposes."
4,"great actor, decent movie","If you're a Charles Bronson fan, this is a good movie you'll enjoy it- definitely not his best. The plot is complicated and the end is weak. The price of this dvd was very enticing."
4,"Film Noir, in color, 1970's style","The music soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin is a gas! Good sound, too. Transfer of film to DVD is nice and clear also. Cool, Fun, 1970's Noir crime mystery movie. Fine actors John Houseman and Jacqueline Bisset co-star. See Robert Englund and Jeff Goldblum in bit parts as street hoods, before they became famous (I'm pretty sure that I saw them in ""Death Wish"" as street hoods also!)."
3,"DECENT, NOT GREAT","The best thing going for this movie is the sizzling mid-70's sound track. The story is not bad, but not riveting either. The acting isn't bad, and it has that retro vibe that is interesting as a period piece (loved the cameo by Jeff Goldblum as a young thug), but Death Wish was more entertaining, and for crime drama, I've seen Starsky and Hutch, or Kojak episodes that were better. 3.5 stars."
3,Likable Bronson Yarn,"Here's a mellow Bronson caper with nice subtle humor in the script, even if director J. Lee Thomson doesn't do much to highlight it. (Fortunately, ""guest star"" Maximillian Schell is along to really sell it with some witty line readings.) The movie doesn't put you on the edge of your seat, but it doesn't bore either and Jackie looks sensational and she has some cool action scenes.(Spoiler alert - when an Oscar-winning best actor shows up for a glorified walk-on, he's likely to figure in the climax of the picture.)As in Death Wish, Jeff Goldbum show's up as an unlikely street hood, who lets out a hilariously feminine shriek during a fight with Chuck."
1,Useless,"Maybe if your installing casement trim.But everyone else installs casing.Casement is a type of window......not a type of trim.If the company doesn't know that, how can they know anything about trim.I had a trim business for 35 years. I see no reason for this tool at all.I love the 7 people that find this review not helpful!Why listen to someone that's a pro.Its why better to listen to the unskilled that thinks this tool has a purpose."
2,Kinda Expensive Gadget,I used the Trim Loc tool for the first time to trim out a door casing. What I found as the tool's only useful feature was how much quicker it was to mark the reveal line (vs using the combination square). I tried to use it for the measuring and either the tape kept falling out of the tape hook slot or the Trim Loc moved off the stock. I guess in theroy it works better if you use the tack holes but how is that a time saver. I'm sure mine is heading to the dusty bottom of drawer #3 in my workshop.
2,"High hopes, let down","Not very useful even for the money. If I'm going to nail it to a bench, I'll use the jig I already have thank you. I don't need to measure the jamb, just measure inside to inside and add your reveal... I was looking for a quick way to measure the inside to inside trim itself. I wanted to mark 30"" on the trim, slap this thing on each end and it automagically add the reveal as I drew the 45 degree angle. I can find no way to get it to do that."
5,GREAT!,Another time saver. I use this instead of setting up my combination square every time I trim out doors and windows. A great little extra every carpenter should have!
2,"Nice tool, but...","I bought one of your laser pointers and the end of the battery case unscrewed. The end was lost and the unusual thread size makes it irreplaceable.I loved the tool and used it to point out equipment 10 to 30 feet over my head many times every day. So, I bought another one.The switch stuck nearly every time I used it.I swapped the battery cap to the other laser pointer and was happy.The batteries leaked and ruined the one that worked.I've never had so much trouble with a product in a single month as I've had with this."
5,Great Little Laser,"At the time I bought it, it was selling for 4.95. Even now it's listed at 9.95 it's a great deal. I have had several lasers but this one is great. It takes 2 aaa batteries which last a very long time.......much longer that I would have thought. The dot is bright red and is very simple to use. Unlike the other cheaper ones that take harder to find button batteries, the aaa ones are much easier to find and replace when needed."
2,Not a happy book,"I read most of this book and could not handle the rest. Having 2 pitbull mixes, I was hoping that it was an enlightening book on the beauty of the American pitbull. It was not. It was a depressing collection of photos on the lives of pitbulls owned by uncompassionate dog owners. They insist they love their dogs, yet tether them to trees and doghouses with giant metal chains. Do they not realize how cumbersome and heavy that weight is to bear on their necks.I do not recommend this book for people who love their dogs. This book, American Pitbull, is a pictorial on people who do not regard their dogs as anything more than a disposable pet, or an income. To them, their dogs do not feel pain, do not need love or compassion, and do not have any thought nor consciousness"
4,Right on the money!,"Mr. Joseph set out to produce a pictorial book that captured the essence of people who live with, train, breed and love the breed of dog known as the American Pit Bull Terrier. He wanted to capture all aspects of the people who are involved with these dogs, and I believe he did just that. My family and I are some of those people! We are not criminals, we are not millionaires. My husband is a lab technician, my son is in kindergarten and I'm the president for the local pit bull club! Any good book will invoke a reaction, good or bad, and you usually can't have one without the other. Most of Marc Joseph's pictures catch humble dog owners in their day to day life... whatever that may be. Not everyone lives in a big house in the suburbs with the white picket fence. If you want to see ""nice, nice"" wait for Martha Stewart's next book... that is as soon as she comes off of house arrest!"
2,What A Disappointment,"Joseph had an excellent opportunity to give this breed the credit it deserves, and he missed the mark. While it's important to show a realistic portrayal of the APBT, the bad simply outweighs the good in this book.While much of the text is positive, and well written, there are more photos that show the dogs in a violent light (i.e. a multi-page spread of two dogs ripping apart a pig).In a nutshell this book will contribute the negative image that APBT's already have, and glorify those who have these dogs for the wrong reasons."
1,Not a good book,"I bought this book because I love American Pitbulls Terriers. I have had 2 pitbulls, both amazing and beautiful animals, but now unfortunately I can't have pets as I live in New York. Frankly it disappointed me thoroughly. My overriding memories of my dogs are their sheer physical beauty and their wonderful characters. The pictures in this book reveal nothing of the true nature of any dog let alone a pitbull. The pictures are either bland and do not remotely portray the majesty of the breed or a lot of them detail what obviously looks like cruelty and are very disturbing. A lot of the photographs in the book are of stereotypical pitbull owners.The essay by James Frey, however, is delightful and interesting. The rest of the text is pointless and uninformative.I would not recommend. If you are interested in pitbulls you should buy something by Richard Stratton."
5,(Faked) pictures of the gone world,"Decked out in their provocative Caballist costumes, John Zorn and Yamatsuka Eye take on the supernaturally mournful folk music of the Diaspora over a crackly bed of ancient 78 surface-noise. Highly amusing and entirely unlike anything else in your collection. If you like this, you'd probably also enjoy the Central Asia volume of ""The Secret Museum of Mankind"" (Yazoo) and Joseph Moskowitz's ""The Art of the Cymbalom"" (Rounder)."
4,Lucy Show,"The Lucy Show was great, Great price for 4 DVDs, Love the Betty White bonus too, she's a precious treasure we have on TV now. Two thumbs up very satisfied!"
5,"Great, little known shoegaze record.","not a bad song on the entire disc.if you like ride,slowdive,revolver and majesty crush you will love this album.the rosemarys hailed from san fransisco and put out two little masterpieces before disappearing:providence and their eponymous 2nd album.both are essential american shoegaze.beautiful stuff!!!!!buy it.you wont be sorry.geez, its only a penny!!!!!!!"
2,"Mediocre story, with lots of sloppy details!","A pretty so-so tale about the first trip to Mars.Mr. Bova decides that he wants his protagonist to be Native American, and then creates a perfect Pan-Indian character. He's supposed to be Navajo, but its clear from the get-go that Mr. Bova knows nothing about Navajo culture, so he feels free to substitute a pretty odd mix of pan-southwestern Indian characteristics that are pretty well both banal and cliché.The major plot complication comes in the form of a mysterious disease that I will not give a spoiler for, but again, its pretty obvious that Mr Bova knows nothing about this illness, as there is no possible way that this disease would have manifest itself in the ways described in the book. In 3 or 4 years, yes this disease might be inconvienient, but crippling in just 6 weeks? A whole lotta bunk in here, my friends.Its too hard to take a novel seriously when such trival details are just plain wrong."
5,Behold The Mysteries Of The Red Planet!,"I can't imagine anyone not showing some kind of fascination with our neighboring planet Mars. Ben Bova creates a fantastic scene which places the reader right there along with the characters. My expectations were that of anything could happen in a strange planet unexplored by humans. There is a possible startling discovery made by Jamie which will keep you reading on and on. I must admit the ending is almost tragic and a bit disappointing, but the entire novel is definitely worthwhile. Bova made sure to leave something to the imagination and to preserve the possible mysteries of the red planet."
2,Eh . . .,"This book might have been tolerable if Bova hadn't gone out of his way to contrive inter-personal conflict. The worst was the woman president of the US who gets angry at the American Indian who (because he was a little nervous, among other reason) says the wrong first words when they first step on martian soil. Instead of some grand-sounding phrase, he utters some ancient Indian saying. This gets the president angry, and (from afar) she begins to hold all these things against the mission and other things. Like . . . get real. No one would get angry over something stupid like that (or, at least I hope no one would. I guess you never know. People get upset over some pretty stupid things. But I find it hard to believe a president would hold such a grudge and take it to such lengths). Also, several things happen on the planet which I find hard to believe. Other reviewers point them out."
1,To repeat a previous reviewer,"""I like hard SF and this is just pure trash. The characters are straight out of some bad tv movie. I got to page 126 and couldnt stand it anymore. Never read Bova before and never will again. What a pig ignorant writer. Hey Bova why dont you get out and travel a little before you go insulting other cultures and nationalities. Uugh!""Now, let me start off by saying I pride myself on finishing books I start, but I have made it in the the 250-300 page range, but MUST stop. The writing is stilted. The characters are cardboard. The treatment of ethnicity is juvenile and insulting (if I read ""red man"" one more time I will puke). And not to be picky, but if you are going to have characters that are Brazilian, shouldn't they actually Portuguese and not Spanish.I wish I could give this negative stars"
2,"GOOD COMPILATION, BAD PICTURE DEFINITION","The 250 Horror Movie Pack is really a dream for many cult movies hunters, because includes some material that is very difficult to find. For example, includes two spanish cult movies (The Sound Of Death and The Fury of the Wolfman), unedited in Spain.Apart from the value of that compilation and de more tan reasonable price, the bad news are the low picture quality of the feature films. Not only most of them are simply transcriptions of VHS tapes, but the compression rate is very poor, so they look even with less quality."
2,Okay if you don't have any of the 50 movie box sets,"When I first saw that mill creek was releasing 100 movie box sets I was kind of hoping they'd up the ante here. but as others have stated. All or most of these can be found in the 50 movie box sets by the same company.You are much better off getting one or more of the 50 movie box sets as that will allow future expansion into the series with less duplicates. There are duplicate titles crossing over in that series of releases as well, but no where near as bad.Release some ""new"" movies Mill Creek."
3,Rubbermaid was taken over by Carex,Just a comment on the last user's review. Rubbermaid was taken over by a company called Carex and no longer uses the Rubbermaid logo on its products. The manufacturing of the items has remained basically unchanged (only the packaging has changed).
4,Cute,"My 4 year old is a total shortcake fan and loves this doll. The larger size and true ""ragdoll-yarn"" hair are great. The only con--you can't remove the hat, shoes and clothes for dress-up doll fun."
5,Great gift,"Its a great gift i bought this for my niece as a birthday gift and she hasn't put it down since she opened it,"
3,THREE LITTLE UNCIVIL PIRATES IN THE WOODS,"THREE LITTLE PIRATES (1946) - A great short. Well written and directed, and the real highlight is Curly - despite his health at the time, he gives in one of his best performances, and he's pure gold during the classic ""Maha"" scene.UNCIVIL WAR BIRDS (1946) - Not a bad short. Interesting casting the boys during the Civil War. The title could've been better. Too similar to 1935's UNCIVIL WARRIORS.BACK TO THE WOODS (1937) - This one is very slow. The first half really drags and the musical box sequence goes on WAY too long. It picks up a little in the second half with the Indian chase. That is, until they got lazy at the very end and reused footage from WHOOPS, I'M AN INDIAN. Weak move. Weak short.Decent tape. Notice that all the shorts shown had the Stooges in a different time period?"
2,strains to be funny...,"The one and only reason to see this is the gorgeous Kim Novak. Novak has charisma to spare. Makes hercharacter, Polly the Pistol, fun, lovely, and--absolutely believable.Walston seems miscast. Martin not very good at all. Writing is contrived & doesn't work.Some claim Wilder was a genius... Seems, to me, he was far better as a director, than a writer."
4,CD Mega Storage,"Love the unit. A little time consuming to set the CD's up and program, but in the long run it is really worth the bother."
5,Introduction to arctic animals,"A beautifully illustrated book introducing young ones to the animals of the north. Polar bears, puffins, wolves and others awaken in this book. The final page wakes up your young one with sweet words and a cheerful heart. This book is delightful for any child who loves animals!"
4,revelador,"A pesar de que algunos ejemplos son un poco exagerados y tal vez algo repetitivos, me sirvió para ""ver"", ""revisar"" y ""cambiar"" muchas actitudes con mis hijos, a respetarlos más y a ser más clara con los mensajes que debo darles, muy buen libro, lo recomiendo, creo que voy a leer más libros de esta autora.-"
2,I bough it for one song,"This is the only place you can get "" little candle"" other than that complete lack luster and boring.. yawn"
3,Clearline Laser pointer,"Since that I have misplaced my original (presumely same model), I have purchased the new one and my original cap didn't fit on this new model! argh! I'll have to workaround it. My original caps are of excellent quality and even has better arrows and pointing hand as well. I noticed one of this new pointer cap has reversed image of ""happy"" with foot."
1,amzon.com sells so poor product?!,"It came to me from amzon.com today. I just had a look at the product in the front of my face and then I realized that its qaulity is very low. Actually it is one of the worst things I ever bought. My friends, get out of here, and look for others."
5,Review on bamboo,I recently purchased the bamboo book shelf on Amazon.com. It was a fantastic purchase. Even better than I expected. It was well worth the money I spent and I know it will be an excellent addition to my home for years to come.
5,"Too expensive, truly extortionate price :)","It's not Zorn you may know from Naked city or albums with Mike Patton, it's (partly) not even Zorn you know from awe-inspiring 'Masada' LPs. It's much more 'legible' piece. But a masterpiece, for me. Some of these songs were included in various Masada albums, but there are some new, anyway. As for the album, it IS dark, it IS expressive, it IS evocative, it IS highly-priced too (:-) ), but worth buying (though sound production could be better, as it sometimes lets a little distortion pop up in one's speakers). It's sometimes lyrical, but all the sime extremely dark, minor."
3,"Abduction Story, Psycho-Side","A story of schizophrenic hanging around bus stations in a search for daughter abducted, made friend with single mother and her daughter of the same age of his and a bluer attempt to abduct her by himself, possessed with grief and empty existence of mental health dole recipient homeless.Good acting-boring tale, which is simply not for average viewer."
1,Beware!,Videos and promos are not complete. They have commentaries that ruin the songs. If you want this to hear the music and see the videos don't buy it.
4,"A compelling, intelligent and at times frustrating novel.","This chef of prose serves up the interminable bond of two wildly intelligent though socially- maladroit people long after their marriage ends in letter form. Oz is tremendously gifted at telling a story and seldom while reading this excellent piece, will you not desire to step in as the peacemaker to rectify the wedge and reunite lost love."
1,Do not read this before you see the show!!,"This book seems hardly more than a transcript of the actualsaid lines. It lacks deapth of it's own and tension of it's own. It'ssort of a report, not an fullgrown gripping story. Though (of course) everthing is set and ready for tension. The actions really SHOULD be a terrific read, but because of the style chosen, it is not.I suppose that, when you read this book after you've seen the last episode on TV, you'll relive that episode while reading. And that that will fill the style gaps that are disturbing me now. But that hardly qualifies this as a good book.And for those of you who are not familiar with the series: do not ever buy this book as a starter. You'll miss all necessary reference to even get through it."
3,not the best but good,"Foojoy make good tea products, I became a tea drinker when I found out the health benefits tea can give you. White tea is somewhat rare to find, this tea in particular shoumei white tea is good but not the best, the price I found it in an Asian store near my house was 1.36$ US dollars, cheap right? You can find better white teas on other sites."
5,Reviewing Space Explorers!,This is a great book for any fans of Ms. Frizzle and the Magic School Bus adventures. I use this book in my summer school class as a whole class reading book to go along with my unit on Space and the Universe.
3,"no magic in the ""magic school bus""",These chapter books have turned this series into almost total nonfiction. When I was reading them to my son we both got bored and then noticed the magic was missing from the series like the shows had. This is a great series but is missing the boat by not adding in some magic for fun and excitement.
1,let's keep on milking the sheep!,"does the remaining doors have ANYTHING better to do than to keep on REHASHING the same songs over and over?come on now how many times have YOU heard ""break on through"" through one of these albums?this band makes metallica look non-greedy!i'll just be getting the IMPORTS OF ELEKTRA RE-ISSUES OF ""THE BEST OF THE DOORS"" WHICH CONTAINS TRACKS OF THE ORIGINAL NOW DELETED VERISON OF ""THE BEST OF THE DOORS"" WHICH WAS RELEASED ON VINAL IN 1973! WITH TRACKS THAT WERE NOT ORIGNAIALLY ON THERE IN THE FIRST PRESSINGS!"
4,Held my attention - in a curiously high brow way,"This book is entertaining, informative and holds your attention in a very 'friendly' sort of way.We all have encountered those 'interesting people' who aren't quite daft, but in spite of a good education, do exhibit the occasional spell of battiness. This is the character of this book.You are intrigued by her path into the mysterious 'foreign service', and titillated by macabre, hilarious and decidedly 'wierd' tales from places in the world most of us will never visit. However, she does pair those stories with insights into a person who is both helpful to others, and a dingbat.There are some very 'human' moments in marriage and parenting that some of us would rather not be reminded of...but these stories do ground the book and let you know that the author is both an average person, as well as an adventurous (and batty) one. She could be one of us.A good read for a break between your thriller novels and steamy ones."

2,the discs skip sometimes...,"I really enjoy the Beverly Hillbillies, but I dont enjoy when I am watching a show and then it starts skipping in the middle....."
5,Loads of laughs :),Good family fun that leaves you wanting more! The only negative was not in the dvd but the fact the case arrived damaged. Other than that no complaints..
4,best of the beverly hillbillies (4pc),its always wonderful to see the frist episode or pilot of a tv series if you missed it first came out!! over all quality was good and also having the lead in theme song and ending credits was great
4,right price,"great for the money, very easy and adjustable will definitely get more for the next project coming up next month."
3,= 6 month life span then explodes=,= hi i am writing this review about the warenty service of pur if somthing goes wrong with the unit = the sink model -There is only a computer to speak with --My water filter unit broke after 6 months =i turned the water on and it cracked -It would seem such a company as pur would have easy product replacement - =THATS NOT THE CASE= They replaced it and it works great
4,Decent Cards,The cards and book are loaded with color and life and emotional expression and the meanings given aren't overally burdensome and avoid negative readings and avoid new agee caltrop. A good deck overall.
3,Whadhesay?,"Though Newman's song writing is excellent his mumbling style of singing is a distraction from the wonderful lyrics and orchestration. A listener really has to concentrate to enjoy the song. Too much work. A person couldn't listen to Mr. Newman too long, because they'd get tired ""working"" at listening.That being said; his songs are unique, tell interesting stories, and most leave you humming the melody after the CD has finished.I've had other CDs and records that I originally thought were ""just fair"", become favorites, as I played them more and the songs became familiar. Perhaps after a few more ""listenings"" The Best of Randy Newman will ""grow on me""......or maybe not."
2,Good selection of songs,"I heard Randy on a TV show recently and loved the song her performed. I thought I would love more of his music, but this CD really wasn't my cup of tea. Maybe other CDs would be better."
4,"Honest, sensual AND romantic!","I liked the honesty throughout this set, but found some of his political exclusionism surprising from such a gentle, sensual and feeling songster."
2,"What time is it, really?","Low vision Mom-in-law visiting for a month over Christmas left her talking clock at home. We received and excitedly inserted batteries. The readout was faulty with only some segments of the numbers actually showing. Not very useful. With holidays, I phoned Erika at the seller - Magnifying Aids, Inc. on 1/3/13. Since the clock was defective they promised to refund cost plus shipping and I mailed it back same day (1/3) at cost of $2.46 USPS. Today, 2/2, I received notice that the cost of the clock was being refunded to AMEX, but not shipping. I'd rate item and seller at 2 stars."
4,Tough to put down!,"Just as in ""The Weatherman"", Steve Thayer's ""Silent Snow"" grabs you right from the first page, and then it won't let go!! There is heart-racing action and/or intrigue on nearly every page. And just as you think you've figured out who the culprit is, Steve twists and another character becomes suspect. Real people and places are interwoven into the story well. The ending is so vivid, you think you're in the middle of all the excitement. Could there be a movie far behind...? Keep them coming Steve!"
3,Blending heroes not a good idea ...,"I love the characters of Grover Mudd and Rick Beanblossom ... but I don't want to think of them as occupying the same universe. Two of my favorite books of recent years were ""Saint Mudd"" and ""The Weatherman."" But Thayer's decision to bring them together in ""Silent Snow"" just doesn't work. I didn't get enough of either of the two characters I like to make it work. Even worse, the Beanblossom half of the story lags far behind the Mudd half in terms of maintaining credibility, interest, etc. Lawrence Block is on to something ... I don't want to read about Tanner and Bernie the Burglar in the same novel. Bring back Mudd -- by himself next time, please!"
1,Worst read in recent memory,"I am a big fan of mysteries and thought this would be a good book based on the plot description on the back cover. Silent Snow turned out to be the worst book I've read in recent memory. It was so bad, in fact, that I tried to return it to the store I bought it from. (Even they didn't want it back.) The author tends toward extrememly short sentence fragments and he overuses the phrases ""the wounded Marine"" and ""the masked man."" Any intelligent high school student could write better prose than Steve Thayer. Not only was the writing style annoying to read, but the plot was totally transparent and the characters very flat and undeveloped. If you're looking for a truly believable, suspenseful mystery try anything by Patricia Cornwell. Her Scarpetta series is the best!"
1,Stupid beyond belief,"This was by far one of the dumbest novels I have ever read. I couldn't wait to get out of the Grover Mudd section of the book. By the time I did, I was greeted with an ending that was completely senseless. By the time I finished, I was so disgusted I left it on the airplane. How have mercy on the poor schlep who picks it up and tries to read it."
1,An insult to low-budget movies everywhere,"The movie tried to tell us several different stories and ended up treating each one so superficially as to be meaningless. The acting ranged from over-the-top (the nelly queen Lester) to dull and listless (the business partner David), although there were certainly some decent performances too. The sound was horrible--the dialogue was so low you had to turn up the volume all the way but then the horrible music would come on and blast your eardrums. In some cases the wind noise on the microphone was so bad the dialogue was completely washed out. The movie tried to make up for the horrible plot(s) and production values by treating us to soft-porn eye candy, but that wasn't enough to redeem it."
2,GOT TO ADMIT - POOR ACTING,"It was actually a good plot, but very poor acting. Looked like it was done on about a $100 budget. I don't think it could be classified as a ""C"" movie if there is such a thing. Very amateur."
1,God Help us....,God has to help any one who can sit and view this film. I had to stop looking at it. This film is poorly made and just plain bad. Don't walk but RUN away from this film in any video store you may see it at. I own this mess. Boy was I sorry. I should of read a review on it first. Take my advice and avoid this mess.
2,i think it's a fake parfume,"I'm convinced it's a fake perfume, because the scent does not lust long enough at all. I had this brand before and i could wear it entire day and people would still sense it. with this one, the scent goes awau in like an hour."
5,Very Strong,"way too Many times folks don't get the facts right on the History of Music.thank goodness Quincy Jones helped put this Compilation together&it showcases a History that hasn't gotten it's full do.Great Writers,Arrangers,Producers,Performers&Creative Minds that have Created Timeless Music.A Big Salute to Quincy Jones&all the Great Minds Featured here I say Thank You&Right ON!"
5,BIG DUMB LOVE - SO. CAL'S NEXT SUPERSTARS!!!,"Simply great music for all ages. Songs like ""All Light"", ""Hey Sadie"", and ""Budda"" are songs you will love first listen. Don't be surprised if you wear out this cd. The connection between these two people is beautiful and it shows in thier music. You can't go wrong on this one!"
1,I am not able to remove the hard case from MacBook Pro,"I was having some problem with my MacBook Pro, and I was instructed by Apple Service Representative to remove the battery from the battery compartment which is on the bottom of the MacBook Pro, and hit the ""shift"" button for two seconds, and replace the battery to correct the problem. But, since I have attached the Speck MacBook Pro 15"" See-Thru Hard Case onto my MacBook Pro, I find it impossible to remove the bottom piece of the hard case to expose the battery compartment. I know the only way to get to the battery compartment is to crack and break the bottom piece of the hard case, and I do not want to sacrifice my hard case which I just purchased recently. Can you help me and give me instruction on how to remove the bottom piece of the hard case without breaking it? If its possible, then, I can give this item a different rating! At this time, its a 1 star or less!"
3,high expectations not fullfilled,"This case has provided no issues with concern to the heat generated by MBPs which was my primary concern. It does seem to have some craft issues though. It is about 3 months old and has no tabs left holding the the bottom peice on. It showed a lot of finger-prints when I first purchased it, but that is no loger a conceren since it is now covered in scratches. I do not think that I have been that hard on the case, but I do take it with me every day, and it shows. The fassests along each side of the top panel appear much more ""gamer-ish"" in real life, which was a bit of a disappointment as well. All in all, It seems to be doing its job, and the price was not bad, even after purchasing some industrial strength double sided tape to keep it on. I would have prefered a slightly more matte finish."
5,Great!!,I was able to find this product even after it was discontinued in 2008. Excellent!It has a few scratches just as they specify in the product description but nothing extreme.
5,completely satisfied,the product was great and was delivered very quickly. i am very satisfied with my purchase
5,Great computer case!,"I love my new computer case! The color is beautiful and it protects my MAC! Very easy to install. Great seller, good price and fast shipping!"
5,"Speck See-Thru Hard Case for MacBook Pro 15"" - Black","A WELL FITTING CASE THAT DOES EXACTLY WHATS IT DESIGNED FOR ,EXTRA PROTECTION FROM SCRAPES AND SCUFFS KEEPS YOUR MAC LOOKING BRAND NEW"
4,juicy and unboring.,"glad they made this snap cover. if u happen to buy a mac in a color u dont like, u dont need to resell your mac, but change how it looks. nobody really stays one color forever. and if u happen to scratch this one, you can replace the snap cover. sinc...Read more >e its see-trough you can put a picture inside the snap-cover like i do, and change it too."
4,MacBook Pro Hard Case,"I just bought my first MacBook Pro, and so want to keep the best care of it! And so, I went looking for the best, most convenient hard case. This led me to the Speck MacBook Pro See-Thru Case. I was impressed by the variety of colors, and decided to go cool black. When I got my new laptop, and got out the case (which arrived weeks earlier, thanks to Amazon, no thanks to MacMall!), it snapped on very easily. I have also been impressed by the way all of the places to plug in are so easily accessed. It also has handy little rubber stoppers on the bottom that keep it from sliding around. The temperature of the MacBook is also lessened a bit by the case, but it seems to be able to breathe just fine.All in all, it looks like a good use of a bit of money to protect something worth quite a bit of money."
4,"Good shape, but is essentially plastic","The case fits the MacbookPro perfectly, and the case makes it really easy to find all the ports with your fingers (if you plug in the headphone cable a lot, you know what I mean). But the case appears to be made of plastic, and it can be difficult to justify paying so much for what is essentially plastic. But so far, I like the case, and don't really have any complaints. I just hope it actually helps somewhat. I'm sure it will prevent scratches, and when it's on the unit it looks great, but I don't know what other protection it will really provide."
2,no contact on attempted return,"The item came as ordered. I accidentally ordered the wrong one and tried to return it. I emailed the company to try to confirm where to return it to and some specifics, and it took three days for them to get back to me, and the email only stated ""we received your email and will contact you as soon as possible. I never heard from them again. I emailed them once more and heard nothing. I ended up putting the item up for sale on another site and it sold and I ordered the correct cover somewhere else. Again, the product was the one advertised, and I ordered the wrong one, but the return service and contact with the company was very poor."
5,Orange,"This fits perfectly but please take it off ever so often a clean your device. A little bit of dust and stuff can still get in. I am very paranoid with my MacBook Pro so I have never banged it and it never fell so I can't comment on the that aspect. You can see the scratches on the case, but that is no big deal for me I can just buy another colour if I want to. Better the case get the scratch that my laptop. I have no problems with opening or closing the screen"
1,DO NOT BUY,"Though the description doesn't make it clear, this product will NOT fit new macbooks. I ordered one for school and there's a sticker on the case itself that lets you know not to open it if you have a new, black keyboard macbook. It gives you info on how to return it (which would have been helpful to know in the first place). I attempted to return it, but did not want to pay the $28 dollar change fee PLUS shipping of $10. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. It totalled more than the silly case was worth. It was cheaper for me to just buy it elseware. So disappointing. Consumer support was equally disappointing, and did nothing to help the situation. This whole ordeal has made be wary of online shopping, particularly the fact that you really can't return it."
4,Definitely a Lifesaver,"The day that I recieved my red Mac cover, I dropped the darn thing - and wouldn't you know it, if I hadn't had the case on it my Mac would have been totalled.This case is very easy to use and really works, it keeps the dings out and makes a pretty little place to put your stickers or stencils without harming the integrity of the Mac.Grade: A."
3,Top Chef Season 2 - Bland At Best,"Nothing special, nothing great. I was kind of bored in the first 10 episodes. do hope the remaing ones are entertaining."
1,Don't buy Unbox,I have had more problems with the download and viewing of this Unbox video. SO I bought it 3 weeks ago and have called Amazon 4 times and still havent seen it. Don't waste your money.
1,New viewer,"I am a new viewer to Top Chef season 4, and it has quickly become my favorite show. While I love the show, I cannot believe I cannot watch the first three seasons anywhere. I am a Mac user like most on here, and would gladly purchase all three seasons if they were on itunes. I have always been a fan of Bravo, but this situation has turned me off to the network, and makes me not want to watch the rest of the season.Go back to Itunes Bravo- or put the seasons on DVD"
2,Intriguing Thesis Gone Wrong,"Dr. Shlain has an intriguing thesis. However, his attempts at supporting it go from somewhat plausible to rather ridiculous. His explanations of characteristcs of left and right brain were commendable, but I could hardly contain my annoyance when he began descriptions of how Christian religion proves his thesis. Dr. Shlain clearly does not understand Christianity, nor are his facts about the history of the Jewish people around the time of the Exodus accurate. This book is perhaps worth reading, and certainly its arguments are compelling, but the evidence does not come together."
2,Quite a disappointment,"I found Mr. Shlain's premise fascinating. Unfortunately, the book didn't carry through on the promise it made. It started off on the wrong foot by never actually giving any evidence that women are more right-brained than men. Some of the historical examples in the book were fascinating. Others were pure speculation, twisted to fit his thesis, or just plain factually wrong. He also fails to clearly define what types of proto-feminism he's looking for. As a result, there are confused and confusing examples where women are enshrined but not enriched or vice versa."
1,Painful,"I borrowed this book from a freind.....no way that I would pay money for this. The Alphabet??? Come on!! Stop blaming everything else for the fact the the world isn't like you want it to be. Research is also lacking, I think some more reputible citations would be in order. Awful. Like a lobotomy."
3,"but... Women have Brains too, And they don't kill.","At first, it seems he's hit on something: an interesting somatically based (i.e. body-based) hyposthesis that the growth in culture of language and symbol manipulation over-stimulated the (supposedly) hunter-killer, left side of the human mind; leading to male aggression and especially, the killing of millions of women (in the so-called witch hunts) over five centuries of European history. But if that were so, then women, as they gained literacy, would have founded large institutions, waged war and murdered millions of men. If that were so, then literate women of today would kill their spouses, rape innocent victims, abuse children, and torture animals, just like a lot of men do.But they don't. So Shlain's argument is fallacious."
5,Memories,When I was a kid my family used to listen to this album all the time. To me this is a sign of real Christmas memories. His voice is lovely when he signs his Christmas carols.
4,Worth the money,I bought this as a gift for one of my brothers. It is a nice set for the money. I would use them myself if I needed a new one because the design and weight are good.
4,Full Moon,"Good story line. Like characters Sara and Dagger and Einstein. Am reading #3 now. wow, What a mixed bag of emotions Sara must feel."
4,Reversible Watch,"I love the watch. I had been given one two years ago as a gift. I liked it so much, I got another one. The gold on the other one started to wear off. I usually wore it with the two tone side up."
4,worth the trip,"I had high hopes for this album...esp. after reading an interview with Eye where he states that they had recorded an album on the beach with their drums in the water! so with that elaborate recording process, i was expecting some truly mindblowing cosmic out of this world unusual results. i assumed that this album would be that particular recording...but after listening to it...i just can't tell. it sounds great and the pieces represented here are well done. but if it really is a seadrum...i wish i could have heard more of the sea. (if this IS in fact, that ocean recording). (???)first track has a great tribal feel...moving fast with lots of percussion and chanting. the piano comes into play quite a bit on this number and adds a beatiful jazzy feeling ala Alice Coltrane. the second song is a total haze out with 1,000 sitars jamming away.not quite the record i was expecting...but then again..it's the Boredoms. i really should have known better."
1,I couldnt tell it was a band .. Im sad..,"to me..this release sounded more like a super-roots/rebore than a boredoms release.The pre-mixed tracks dont seem new ( think I recognize a few from previous CDS) and yea.. its boring... after so long telling everybody that these guys are a musical Icon... they have created another ""PIOUGHED"" (another god type band.. ""who jumped the shark""? ) I can only hope the future is brighter, but my guess is that the days are gone of outstanding boredoms releases and .. hmm.. I dont know.. it makes me sad.."
2,Incredibly disapointing,"sigh. when i saw this, i wondered how the hell inuyasha could be such crap. it is a phenomanal series, the writing is poor, the plot, and just everything. the 2nd movie was incredible, and the 3rd made me speechless. skip this one, go to the 2nd, than the 3rd. you won't regret this."
5,Love it!,Love this series SO MUCH! The movie is so incredible! Really great movie and characters! It is SO worth buying!
5,Good Stuff,"Great movie. To put it simply, if your a fan of Inuyasha, then you will love it. I believe any true fan of anime would also greatly enjoy this movie. If you are not within the two above categories, you may have a harder time enjoying it. None the less, if your looking an interesting story, I'd get a copy of this movie."
5,All BNO fans need this...,"This DVD was great, and quite long too! The mockumentary is very funny, and the live show is a great addition. The wit and skill of the band members is evident throughout....all BNO fans need this."
3,DID NOT SEE,"Did not even open box,and sent it back. reason i ordered it by accident . Thought I was ordering a Microwave. Adam"
4,Shaver decent for price,"The panasonic 3041 wet/dry shaver performs well especially for the $30-40 price. Especially since we live in a disposable world where no one can afford to get anything fixed. Replace parts for this shaver are also reasonable. Before you buy any electric shaver, find out what the replacement parts will cost.Dougcbus"
2,"Widescreen, yes....","This concerns the First Run Features 24 Sep 2002 release of ""Tuvalu,"" (UPC 720229910286). Yes it's an interesting little film. And yes, it's presented in widescreen format in this release. Unfortunately it is *NOT* anamorphic, so it will fill about 50% of a modern flat-panel display. I wish someone had mentioned this, somewhere, before I found out the expensive way..."
1,Waste Of Money.....,"I bought this because it was a Gold Box item, and seemed cool. I can't imagine how angry I would be now if I had spent $50.00 on this (The suggested retail price....).The laser pointer is cool, but after two weeks of moderate use at work, the pen ran out of ink, and there seems to be no way to fix that. The pen is much heavier than a normal pen, so writing was awkward, and unless you put a lot of pressure on it, the ink would often skip. There's no way to replace the ink cartridge, so without ink, you're left with the World's biggest Laser pointer. Total waste of money, plus it took forever to arrive, and I got murdered on the S&H.; Buy a case of cheap Paper Mate pens and a normal Laser pointer and scotch tape them together- You'll be much happier."
4,Deep Blue Sapphire CZ Ring,"Deep Blue Sapphire CZ Ring: This is an attractive sterling silver ring with a beautiful deep blue large stone in the middle, surrounded by clear cut small stones."
1,Should have been checked by seller before sending,This was a very pretty ring but a few of the stones are loose. I feel that it should have been checked by the seller before sending it out.
5,princess Diana want to be,"I love this ring it is pretty, wasn't as big as I was afraid it would be, perfect size. I wear it all the time."
2,Pretty but wear with caution,"O.K. this is my second try doing the review for this item. When I bought this item in November the cost was only $9.99. It says Sterling Silver (I wear sterling silver jewelry all the time so I thought nothing of it) and began to wear it the day I got the ring in it's little white box. I took it off when I got home-before washing dishes, sleeping, showering etc. then wore it the following day to work. It turned my finger green after wearing it for only 4 hours. Someone told me to put clear nailpolish on it but why should I have to do that if it's genuine sterling silver like all my other rings that don't turn my finger green? It's pretty, thats for sure but I can't wear it too long due to the green factor. I wouldn't pay more than the $15 bucks (shipping and handling along with the price tag) I ended up paying for it."
5,An Intimate Portrait of a Chinese Boy,"This book is a wonderful autobiographical portrait of a Chinese boy growing up in rural China during Mao's Cultural Revolution. In it, one experiences the shift in personal and private freedoms and their costs to bonds of work, family and friends. I didn't expect to be captured and spellbound by this work - ie. although I've been to China several times, I did not expect to 'love it.' However, the book is simply magical. This is due, to a great extent, to Da Chen's tender and acute use of the English language, his skill as a literary artist. However, it also presents experiences most of us recall - childhood comrades who were fast friends, and those who were bullies, the lessons to be learned and springboards for one's future. I highly recommend this for its tender and intimate portrait of a boy in his family."
4,Colors of the Mountains,"An interesting story of what life was like after Mao's introduction of the Communist Party to China, written by a young man full of spirit and will who was determined to succeed in the educational system which prevailed at the advent of Communism, in spite of all that he was up against. Enjoyable and well written. Never bitter about everything that happened to him, he took the lemons life handed him and made lemonade."
2,Not as good as I had expected,"Colors of the Mountain was not as well-written as I would have liked it to be. Though it appeared to be a good book, it definitely was not a really memorable one or a great literary work. The author's words weren't very eloquent, as he often repeated the same adjectives, etc. Save your money. Somewhat educational about China during this time period, but other than that, I was disappointed."
3,not Miranda Lee's best,"The Magnate's Mistress is the 49th stand-alone romance by Australian author Miranda Lee and is part of the Mistress to a Millionaire series. Tara Bond has been seeing hotel magnate Max Richmond for a year, but their relationship consists mostly of wining, dining and bed during his fleeting visits between jetting around the world on business. Max professes to love her, but her mother Joyce and sister Jen have made comments that make Tara think about what she wants from the relationship: will Max ever want her for more than just a mistress? Then Tara finds she's pregnant, but she's pretty sure Max isn't ready for marriage and children. While Tara's character is nicely developed, Max is rather two-dimensional and some of the detailing of his backstory is little short of clumsy. An OK read, but not Miranda Lee's best."
5,Old Favorite Found at Last,"Kurt Russell has been one of my favorite actors since I was a child. I have never seen this movie, and I'm delighted to add it to my collection. Thanks, Disney, for finally releasing it."
5,Christian Dior Air 1 Sunglasses,Great product and great seller. Shipping was fast. Glasses are perfect.
1,Worse than stock speakers,"They sound fair (by NO means great) untill you get to just under half power on a 50wx4 kenwood head unit. Anything over about 20 watts has a lot of ratteling noise from in the speaker sounding like it's going to blow out, there is not much bass and everything out of it is distorted, not at all clear or sharp sounding. They sound a lot worse than stock speakers. I got these as cheap junk speakers to make a mobile unit ran off car batteries to take down the river... I will not even use them for that, I would rather listen to silence than the noise these things make. 100% waste of money and time."
5,YOU'D THINK WILLIE CLAYTON WOULD BE A HOUSEHOLD NAME BY NOW....,"Maybe because of his jumping from label to label his prevented him from really getting out there, but by no means because of his singing and/or choice of songs. On ANY Willie Clayton album you're gonna find at least 4 (Four) to 6 (Six) favorites! Point And Case...The keys cuts here are: ""Everytime You Go Away"", ""Cheatin' On Me"", ""Stop Running From Love"", ""I Got Beat Out"", and ""That Woman Ain't Havin' It""...See how easy that was??? If he (Willie Cayton) was to find a record company and really stick it out, we'd see and hear a whole lot more from a what could easily be a strong name in the world of Deep Soul!"
3,Fluffy Baroque Pop,"If there's anything that can be described as 'fluffy baroque pop', Fugu 1 might be it. At first, it sounded like late Stereolab meeting 'Pet Sounds' era Beach Boys. But upon listening to it further, it's basically a mix of sweet 60's pop, lush melodies, with baroque-style instruments, eg, harpsichords and strings. Fugu's vocals (shades of Gilbert O Sullivan) is accompanied by delicate candy-coated music, that soothes but has enough bite to it as the sametime. It almost as if Fugu may have gone to the Sean O'Hagan or Brian Wilson school of music, yet has a degree in Medieval or Baroque history. A tad thin on range, Fugu 1 gradually becomes tiresome, but this 'period piece pop' is interesting enough where it might be worth a listen."
5,Works as advertised,The light sensor can be used when color is not important. The 2 sensors we ordered arrived quickly and work great.
4,Inanna adds a new dimension to Sitchins works,"I was very pleased to feel a whole new dimension opening up when I first read the Inanna book. Sitchins interpretions and conclusions are rather ""dry"" and academic by nature. After reading Inanna Returns the Sumerian tales became alive. I recommend the book for anyone who has read the Sitchin works."
5,Excellent nonparametric statistics book,This is (together with Empirical Methods for Artificial Intelligence by Paul R. Cohen) the best of the statistics books I read.
5,Excellent Restorative Hatha Yoga!!!!!,I found this Hatha Yoga workout to be restorative. It relaxes all tension from the body and mind. It relieves stress & anxiety. The sequence of postures is relaxing and an invigorating moving meditation. This is a balanced Hatha Yoga practice. The scenery is a beautiful natural Cape Cod beach setting. The instructor's voice is serene. She also has a background in stress reduction. Making this a perfect workout for people with high stress lives.
4,Disk 2 makes it all worth it!!,"I thought about giving Party Time 5 stars until I realized that I wasn't crazy about Disk 1. Disk 1 was a bit too ""disco"" for my tastes. Disk 2, however, has some of the best songs ever created! I am very happy that I bought Party Time 2002."
3,American Soldiers,"I came upon this movie while searching for something of interest to watch on TV. I had missed about a quarter of the movie but was intrigued by the action sequences. It is a fast passed action movie. I did not think it was all true but neither was it all fiction. If this is an honest portrayal of the war going on in Iraq, I feel for our soldiers who are stationed there."
3,It's good to have Vic back,"Five years haven't softened Vic. She's still feisty, smart and strong. I admire the way she speaks her mind -- whether it's about class distinctions, race or even midlife career crises -- and I enjoyed spending time with a character who has that level of depth. I just felt the end came too soon, and that the love relationship was introduced too quickly to be convincing. Still, it was a very good read."
2,Improbable,"Spoilers WithinA more appropriate title would have been ""A Series of Improbable Events"". The characters are interesting and the premise good and mysterious. But why did this ""Security"" pursue Warshawsky in the first place? They get a t-shirt from Frenada to put on the dead body of the escaped inmate - why not go to Wal-Mart? Warshawsky goes into the CEO's home computer - gets easily through the passwords and then sends incriminating emails - very baffling? The prison sequences are contrived and out of place. And why did the ""Security"" firm kill Frenada?None of this adds up - too bad because the writing and the characters are clear-cut and lucid."
1,I'm sorry I purchased this book.,"This book started out slow and continued to be slow. It is not the ""thriller"" it is portrayed to be. There are too many characters that have no relationship to each other which made the story line hard to follow. Finally 1/2 way through, I skipped to the end and read it -- something I haven't done in years. This is the first book by Mr. Campbell that I have read; I doubt if I will purchase any others."
2,Disappointed,I was looking forward to playing this game. Unfortunately its too time consuming to set up - prize and cover pieces are both made from cardboard - difficult to place in slots and won't hold up long before all bent up and useless. The answers havent changed from the tv show - what child knows what an awl is? great for a small dose of nostaglia but needs to get w/ the times. Sorry
4,Missa Johnouchi,"I bought this CD for just one song "" Marco Polo "" I didn't want to lose any of the sounds made by any instruments , MP3's are deficient in total sound reproduction , and decrease the brillance, So a CD was requirement."
1,1 sentence review,"The game sucks and so does this strategy guide, so please do not buy either!!!! I love you all!!!"
4,Republication needed,"More timely today than in 1991, first publication. Some company should republish the three book series. Excellent SF read, with amazing links to today."
1,Training wheels,"This device is okay. The wireless keyboard is fun, it's fun to hook it up to the RCA inputs in your VCR and send Grandma videotapes of this ""Newfangled Internet thing"", and it has older versions of Flash, ShockWave. No java, though. And even though you pay $20+ a month, it still says you're a ""Guest"" in their own dang chat rooms, so you get flamed like the ""noob"" that you are. Use it, but save your cash for a real computer."
2,"Does what it says, but will shorten the life of your batteries.","This charger auto-shuts off based on time, not based on the actual charge of the battery. Therefore, this will overcharge batteries that don't need a full charge, which will destroy your batteries. Pay $30 for one of the sony chargers that are much better."
2,Won't charge an odd number of batteries,"This charger only works with 2 or 4 batteries, and won't work with an odd number. Considering that the primary motivation of me getting it was so I could charge the batteries in my bike light, which takes 3, this is a substantial disappointment.The package doesn't say anything about this restriction. Save your money and go with a more honest company."
3,Nice packaging. Too little inside.,"I'm a fan of old game shows. I have copies of the fifties and sixties version of ""Beat the Clock"" in my collection. When Endless released this one, I was excited because of the great job they've done on other game show box games. Unfortunately, the great box contains very little of note.The only real improvement over the sixties version is that they've replaced the big noisy timer with a small digital one. Nice try, but not quite there."
1,Awful,"Nobody outside christian circles, and few people inside, would want to listen to this. For Petra at its best, try Beyond Belief or On Fire."
2,Why?.....,"I think John Zorn can put out some really great stuff once in awhile (the gift, naked city stuff etc) but this really kind of does it in for me. Leave it to John Zorn to release an album of nothing but random improv sounds from various reeds from wind instruments.Anyone who considers this album genius is probably the same kind of person who would stand in front of art gallery painting of a red dot on white canvas and ponder for hours on what the artist's deep intentions could have been. Only to realize an hour later that someone put a Japanese flag on display."
4,I love it!,I had the chance to be in the world premier of the show on stage as one of Job's daughters. This show is now near and dear to my heart. Its a must have for any musical lover. Soon we should be seeing this one on Broadway. I hope soon this can be in your cd player.
5,"A wake up call against government-run health care, including the VA","""Article 99"" is an amazing field precisely because it comes from Hollywood, which has said for years that government-run health care is some sort of utopia. The film, however, shows a different story. The film shows the inhumane, bureaucratic-focus of health care when administered by a government agency. Patients come last and are considered merely numbers. Doctors are not permitted to consider the needs of their patients. Rather, patients (in this case veterans) receive sub-standard, rationed care. This movie is a wake up call, and proves that government-run health care is not about health care, but about government power. Government-run health care must be opposed, including for veterans. Rather than run this terrible VA system, veterans should receive vouchers to shop for health care on the free-market."
2,A Psychological thriller with bad special effects and horrible plot,"4 women wake up after having their identities checmically erased. They are them subjected to physical and mental abuse while a doctor records everything on what looks like a stereo with a calculator on top with ans ossiliscope screen on the side. Very low budget, the plot has lots of holes and the final revelation was astoundingly Stupid. However some of the women were actually decent actresses and there were psychological elements that has some promise. Would like to see this Movie remade with some serious plot revisions, a better budget and director, but it did have some good elements. Not one I'd recomend tho."
3,Rust? :(,"I bought this watch about 6 months ago. I was very satisfied with this purchase. Although the band says ""Genuine Leather"" it feels like vinyl. I guess the phrase ""you get what you pay for"" and ""you pay less, you get less"" applies to this watch. The ""gold"" frame of this watch is already starting to have rust spots. Not too sure how much worse it will get, but it looks like it'll eventually spread. Final thoughts: Invest in a better watch. This watch is only good for a few months."
5,Long-lasting and durable,I have one of these binders I bought 3 years ago for myself. It is large and the plastic is thick. I ordered several for my kids ages 12 and 13 for their schoolwork. They were a big hit. The other binders available in stores were very flimsy.
4,microfiber bikini panties,"These are great so far but I have yet to try them on after washing. The fabric is silky and a nice quality. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars would be that the seams are fairly thick making them a poor choice for wearing under certain types of pants, like a knit, where panty lines might be a problem. Under jeans they are perfect. I will probably order several more pairs for the high quality and fantastic price."
4,barely there,"Love these underwear, very comfortable. My only problem was I can still smell the chemical on them."
1,HOW COULD MEG RYAN MAKE THIS MOVIE..........,"I honestly cannot believe Meg Ryan could/would make this ""movie"". It is nothing more than a soft-core porn movie with a lot of famous actors in it. It was way over the top.Everyone makes a mistake...And this was a big one.The cops were annoying with the constant foulness and aggressiveness. I just don't get it.This is an all-time new low for Hollywood."
3,Ryan in a total different light!!!,"Over all the movie is well made and really dark. Right from the begining you get the feel that it is going to be dark and abstract. The plot, a detective and his partner are trying to find a killer who is killing young women and cutting them up. Ryan plays a English teacher in the movie. It turns out she was in the building where a young women was killed. The cops now want to speak with her to find out if she has any info to offer. She soon finds her self in a ... relationship with the dective. ... Very emotional[.] ... The movie ends good and is pretty violent and nasty at some points. Also very different from what Ryan usually plays for a roll. The movie has some really explict parts, with nudity and violence. But alltogether the movie is good!! 3 stars."
1,In the Cut - Should have been cut on the editing floor,"Disjointed, sleepily paced piece of hodge podge. Not believable. Supposedly a murder investigation but doesn't seem to be a major point. Then the obvious happens as it finally, and thankfully ends. Meg gave a good performance, but Malloy's character was an immediate jerk who Fannie would never have stayed with past the first ""I'll lick your...."" remark 5 minutes into their first date. Not believable and slow. What I really could have done for that 1 hour and 58 minutes....."
2,An Important Film,"This is an important film. The main characters are intelligent, sensitive, articulate . . . all others are men. This film brings misandry (hatred of men) to a new level of fine art. There is a famous Norwegian painting entitled: ""The Scream"". It was recently stolen from its home museum in Oslo. Meg Ryan, Nicole Kidman (producer) and Jane Campion have combined their creative talents to produce this movie so that no one will miss the painting. . ."
4,BOOM!,"Well, I liked it! Hot and Wierd at the same time:)) Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo...Great together..It's all good:) I'm hooked on Mark now!! You'll watch it more than once:) Well, I do....:))"
3,Meg's Expression-less Face,"I liked this movie, and appreciated Meg Ryan expanding her acting talent but this movie isn't for everyone. My boyfriend hated this movie, while i liked it. I wasn't too impressed with MEg's performance, though. She didn't seem to have more than two expressions on her face, and I've seen her in way better roles, i.e. When a Man loves a Woman. And I was disappointed that Jennifer Jason Leigh's character was without depth since this movie could have used her more. She was excellent in Dolores Claiborne, so if you're a fan, see her in that. Mark Ruffalo's Detective character was good, but I have to admit the plot has been done a thousand times before. The movie gave a creepy feeling with the camera shots, music, and Meg's daydreaming scenes, but overall this movie was ok, not great."
1,Not a good movie at all,This movie was as embarrassing for me as it should be for Meg Ryan. No artistic value whatsoever. The gratuitous sex was not worth the trouble.
5,People are really sleeping on this film,"this film was fantastic. Maybe it's because i went into it with low expectations because of the reviews, but i have to say it's one of the best films i've seen in a while. It reminded me of a gothic novel, dark and extremly sensual and romantic-there is something so romantic about this film--oh yeah, it's Mark Ruffalo...whew is he sexxy. I haven't read the book but sometimes you have to seperate the book from the movie to enjoy the movie for what it is. I loved every minute of it. In 10 years people will come around to it's beauty i'm sure or maybe it'll just have a cult following but i know i'm not the only one baffled by the bad reviews, truly..."
3,"Not bad, Definantly different though.","Alot of people didn't like this movie, and alot of people probably won't. It starts out a little slow and wierd.It's not really much of a thriller,The movie focuses most on the sexual relationship of (Meg Ryan And Mark Ruffalo).I, although found the movie quite interesting.I think that the reason alot of people didn't like this movie is because they really didn't understand it."
1,Awful,"I can't believe I wasted my money renting this movie, then paying late charges because I kept putting off finishing watching it. Shame on me for being a gullible consumer and for wanting to see Ms Ryan naked, which was nice but didn't make up for the rest of the movie.This movie is a mess. Hand-held camera shots substitute for verité; dreary songs substitute for plot; swear words substitute for grittiness; senseless coincidences (e.g., red lighthouses) substitute for portent; characters act completely against reason; loose ends abound. Stay away, far away, from this movie."
3,Why change the ending?,"Susanna Moore's urban novel, ""In the Cut"" has become a piece of film that doesn't seem to reel you in. As much as I like Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo in their roles, they cannot leap over the hurdle of a screenplay that doesn't work in their favor. The film is more faithful to the eroticism in the book, but not to the thriller aspects, and it is here that it loses. In the novel, we come close to our narrator (Frannie), yet in the book, because we do not have the benefit of first person, we are distanced. I'm glad, in a way that the movie ended the way it did, but the proof in the pudding is in the book -- the vulnerability of the main character is completely exposed. And why is ""In the Cut"" not explained to us as it is in the novel?Read the book for one wild ride."
1,I want my $3.85 back,"I think what they were trying to do in this picture is show what a great film noir they could make now that they are so free -- free from all those restrictions of the studio system respecting dialogue, free from conventional ways of ""seeing,"" free from the need to disguise various flavors of sexuality. But in filmmaking, freedom isn't enough. You also need to have some talent, and there is more narcissism than talent on display here. Arty photography, heaving sex scenes, and dialog that tries to be hip aren't enough to dress up the predictable ""will he kiss me or will he kill me"" plot. The film is bad enough, but more atrocious is the sheer arrogance of what the filmmakers must have been thinking when they made it."
1,Horribly Executed,"You would think that with a screenplay written (or co-written by Oliver Stone), directed by Michael Cimino, and had Mickey Rourke cast as the lead--that would be a great film, but this movie falls completely flat on its face. The writing is so clunky and overbearing and preachy, and the scenes were stitched together is such an amateurish way--I could barely finish watching this movie. It felt so incredibly dated. There were a couple of things that really stuck out (in a bad way) for me. 1) Mickey Rourke is way too young for the role--and having that fake grey hair dye job only made him look ridiculous. 2) The woman (Ariane) who played the reporter, was absolutely horrible. It's obvious that she's a model and not an actor. Oh--actually there is one more thing about this movie that really grated on me. The film score was awful--it stuck out like a sore thumb. There's nothing worse that having music that just doesn't fit the scene."
1,Did Mickey Rourke write the rest of the reviews here?,"What's the difference between this movie and a Schwarzenneger movie? Answer: A Schwarzenneger movie has better dialogues, a better plot, and better acting.How could the guy who made Deer Hunter come up with this dud? More intriguing still, how can anybody say anything nice about this colossal disappointment."
2,FWD,"Its great that Iggy reunited with the Stooges but this CD is not so great. The songs just arent that good. There is no urgency, no passion in the singing. There arent many good hooks or melodies. The guitars arent very buzzkill and the lyrics are trite. The only decent song is ""My Idea of fun"". Unless you get the Japanese Import which has ""O Solo Mio"" which is a damn good song. Why that was left off the US version is a real tragedy!! My advice is, use the Weirdness as a coaster or frisbee and then buy Beat Em Up, Raw Power (Iggy mix) and Funhouse and crank those up instead.."
4,Very good,"This is gotta be one of the best up and coming bands out there. The music is original, catchy, and the lyrics flow along creating a great music masterpiece. Highly recommended for light rock fans."
3,an atypical artist,"I didn't know anything about this artist. I enjoyed this work and I imagine his fans would really like it. He was not a typical, gallery artist. Toulouse-Lautrec's works were posters; Norman Rockwell did work for magazine covers. Parrish made many works for children's books. Honestly, if you think that children's books are ""low culture"" or you hate anything not rendered in a realist style, then you may not like Parrish's work.This documentary is just a slide lecture. The makers try to jazz it up by having instrumental music playing in the background. I don't recall the work ever showing a photo or self-portrait of the artist. Like Georgia O'Keeffe (sp?) and Frank Lloyd Wright, this artist was inspired by the Southwest.Because he did so much work for children's stories, there's a chance that children may sit through this and be delighted."
1,Wahl 9636-517 Haircut Kit,This product was LOUD. I cannot recommend this product. The supplier satisfied my concern.
5,Great!,"If you are looking for a tarot deck, this is it! Beautiful images, and very good quality cards."
2,What?,The cards are wonderful but the book is absolutely positively confusing. I had much better luck with a booklet that came with another set of cards I bought.
2,not as described,"The cards were fine, but it stated that it was never used, however the book binding was broken in 2 or 3 places, and the mini reference booklet was missing, and the box was crushed."
5,Beautiful Cutlery,This product is a handsome addition to any table setting. The cutlery has a substantial feel in the hand. I am quite glad I purchased the product.
5,Sturdy and stylish,"Gorgeous, but not a style that will appeal to everyone. Obviously very well crafted, sturdy. Will last us a century."
3,Rco International MP3 Mole & Gopher Patrol Bait,I'm not sure it works...I still have a million moles and gophers all over my property and the bait is always being pushed to the top of their mounds/hills.
5,Magic School Bus a big hit,"We got these for something to read on a long airplane ride with my 4 year old. He really liked the story, and it was educational, too! We'll definitely be getting more in this series."
4,Good,I bought this book as a gift and it was well received. It looks like a really good read with a lot of historical value.
1,cheap plastic,My friend purchased one of these online a couple of years ago - and her's was much heavier. This is made of very light plastic.
4,KX-FLB801 All-in-One Fits the Bill,We needed a copier/printer/fax solution for an office on a mobile offshore drilling rig with limited space and one that would work with our VSAT communications system. The 4 KX-FLB801's purchased over the last 12 months resolved both the space and compatibility issues on our offshore rig units.
2,okay,This game can be a lot of fun but it only has enough for four couples. Many of the questions are not things I would discuss with anyone else--we eliminated or altered them so as not to embarrass ourselves or our guests.
3,Great Game for Couples!!! Lots of Fun,This is a great game to play with several couples! It brings a lot of laughs!! Definitely a must have!
1,Just Lost Interest,"After reading the reviews, I was hopeful I had discovered a new author to give me my thrill fix. Sorry to say, this wasn't it. I just simply didn't care about any of these people. I made it through 3/4 of the book and was so disappointed. The story dragged. I found the whole premise preposterous. And Alice was not a sympathetic character. I kept picturing Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis as the aging comedians and Alice as some ditzy English floozy from a bad sit-com. Perhaps I just didn't care for all the English sayings, ""I fancied him, she fancied him""...""And Bob's Your Uncle, there it was"".I don't recommend this book or the author for anyone who likes their mysteries and thrillers fast-paced or interesting. A big thumbs down despite the critical acclaims."
4,"Diverse, fleshed-out parts add up to another quintessential John Zorn whole","A strong, diverse first entry into his gigantic Film Works series finds the always-eclectic composer offering up an ultra diverse sampler from three of some of Zorn's earliest independent movie scorings. A few tracks are rough around the edges, but when that is not working in any piece's favor, the seemingly unlimited wealth of talented players always working with our warped maestro still usually demands attention. Even if we are listening to a tired blues theme or a standard jazz progression, the variations on these themes remain interesting for the most part still to this day. Hitting a masterful stride with the horn-heavy third act, Zorn proves once again why he is one of the most versatile, edgy, and equipped composers working today."
4,great range of weight,"This weight is great. It is sturdy, easy to change weights, and even looks nice. It is a bit expensive though. My other complaint is that, although clearly labeled, I missed it, it is only sold as a single dumbbell. WTH!!??!?! Who buys only one dumbbell? Obviously I did. lol. . . . and now I am waiting for the other one . . . this reminds me of cereal boxes that lower the amount of serving from a cup to 3/4 cup or 1/2 cup to keep the caloric count low . . . a hate stupid sale techniques like that . . .$600 for two dumbbells that give you 10lbs to 90lbs, not half bad especially if you would look at the price and space it would take to have separate dumbbells. It also changes by five pound increments. pretty slick."
4,Selecttch 1090 Review,"I bought a set of the SelectTech 1090 dumbbells for my husband's birthday. He has been doing P90X and needed weights over 35 pounds (we have dumbbells up to 35). The price of the higher weight dumbbells made it almost as expensive to buy the individual dumbbells and they would have taken up so much space.He loves them. The simplicity of use and the fact that they don't take up a lot of space. We have not bought the stand yet, but I'm sure we will in the future. He is just using them off the floor for now.I find them incredibly bulky. It would be hard to do some exercises (like where you work your triceps behind your head) with these. I would definately recommend trying to use a pair of the 1090's before you buy."
4,Almost Perfect!,"I've owned the SelecTech 552's for several years and I love them, but I was starting to outgrow them and wanted a bit more weight. I purchased a set of the 1090's and they're great. My only gripe about them is that the handles aren't as comfortable as the 552's, but I just wear workout gloves now and that has mostly remedied the issue. I would highly recommend either the 552's or the 1090's for anyone who wants a well made and versatile adjustable dumbbell set. Be sure to get the stand!"
4,Perfect Solution,"I just got these dumbbells and started working out from home. I also own a Bowflex Ultimate 2, but needed this to alternate and change up my work outs. First Impression, it seems to be built solid and hope will serve my purpose for a long time. I just went with 1090 rather than 552 as it seems to be more future proof as far as bench press, shrugs and dead lift go. I read some people feeling the need to use a glove, I did not have the issue, not sure why. It is kind of long and so I agree with another reviewer about doing biceps curl at the same time. I have not used other dumbbells to compare, but this definitely looks and feels solid.Amazon as usual is awesome to buy from and everything came perfectly and is cheaper than any other place I looked at including Bowflex."
3,Don't buy just one,This is only one dumbbell. I needed two. I know I'm an idiot but make sure you buy two.
4,Size Matters,"Easy to use. Great for small workout spaces (i.e. dorm, bedroom, office). Really good for bust-em-out programs like P90X where quick weight changes are required. Only problem occurs when range of motion is limited due to the width of the dumbbell (about 18""). This problem rarely occurs (only two exercises in P90X are affected as far as I am concerned). I must follow up by saying that the benefits of having so many choices in one dumbbell far outweigh the costs. Also, you really need two of these to appreciate the effectiveness."
5,One of my favorite guitar rock CDs,Excellent music from a marvelous guitarist and musician! One of the most underrated rock guitarists of the 90s! Check this CD out!
1,QUICK - Get RID of the machine that requires this product!!!,"The Smithsonian must be clamoring for this machine. Because installing the antiquated ribbon system with its falling-out spindles and unraveling film is an exercise in patience that I have failed miserably. The fact that I don't beat the person over the head that ordered this for me is a testimony to my restraint. I don't know what was paid for this machine, but if he didn't get it in a box of Cracker Jacks he paid too much. These types of machines can be had too cheaply to put up with this nonsense. Whew. Now let me go find my copy of Office Space!"
5,what happens when your dad kills your mom,"""When Dad Killed Mom"" is a murder story that you can't put down. It's about two kids, Jeremy & Jenna, who now have to live with the fact that their dad murderded their mom. Jenna dosen't want to believe that her dad murdered her mom.Jeremy & Jenna had no one to take care of them,so they had to live with grand parents. Jeremany didn't want to live with his grand parents. He wanted to live in his mom's stuido where he could feel closer to his mom. When his grand parents wanted to move to Florida, Jeremany and Jenna didn't. Their mom's friend adopted them.I really liked this book because it kept me on my toes to find out what happened in the next chapter.Thats why I like the books that Lester writes. I can't wait for her next one to come out!-Ryan Keckeisen-"
4,Interesting,"I frankly don't know what to say about this book... I mean the beginning of the book relived the horrors of health class (sex ed) but like one hundred times worse... well besides that I thought it was a pretty okay book... despite the fact there is a lot of cussing on Jenny's part and the book is not for everyone... I believe this book is geared for more 'mature' readers. It was unique and I haven't seen anything like it, if you like books that deal with an 'interesting' topic then this is for you and if you are easily grossed out then kindly put this book back and go read another more toned down novel..."
5,Free Play Review,"One of the best books I've read on the value of play, both for artists and for non-artists as well. The writing is smooth flowing and easy to not only understand but to feel as well. Creates an easy to follow road map to that place within where play is an integral part of who we are."
2,Book OK but subject Obsolete,"guy@swarc.com must have spent even less time looking at the book than he claims. My copy of the book (bundled with Symantec Cafe - note correct product title) described release 1.2 even though the bundled software was release 1.51. These versions are based on Java 1.0.2. The product referred to by the afore-mentioned reviewer is Visual Cafe for Java 2.x, based on Java 1.1.x. No wonder the book didn't match the product! The book itself is fair but doesn't get deep enough to be fully helpful; however, because it is a couple of years out of date it belongs back on the shelf next to your books on Fortran II and BAL."
3,I would give it 5 stars but.....,"I bought one of these quite awhile ago. I still have it. Its design is great as has already been covered here. Very nice and compact package with an ingenious design for the final adjustment. HOWEVER, on my unit, which is all black and no red as pictured, the tapered pinch piece on the end of the tightening knob is plastic and after only a few uses cracked and popped out the back. Now it only tightens part of the way before spinning. SO BE VERY CAREFUL tightening the knob in case this happens to you. Hopefully the newer designs replaced this piece with metal."
5,Great monopod for 70-200 or lighter,"I've owned three of these over 20+ years (lost two, leg lock on one broke). They're very good within their limits. Extremely compact, fast (QR leg locks), eliminates the need for a ball head, quick release that doesn't require a special tool. Great with my 70-200 f2.8l/Canon 1D mark II. Saves me from tendonitis carrying the darn thing around all the time.Sure, it's not quite as steady as my Bogen or Gitzo, but the ballhead alone costs more than the Slik EZ Pod. I like that it uses the 1/4"" thread, so I don't have to keep track of a bunch of adapters. Doesn't work that well with the 300mm f2.8l, the lower legs and the pan head just aren't beefy enough.Over a day's shooting, the QR plate will loosen and create a bit of play, but considering that I don't have to fumble around for an allen wrench to tighten it and can switch the plate to a different lens or camera faster, it's a good tradeoff. It's compact and light enough that it's easy to take everywhere."
3,Not the place to learn molecular simulation,"The early chapters are really just a review of the available literature on the topic - a better place to start is the book by Frenkel and Smit. The redeeming feature is the interesting final chapter on object-oriented programming, though this won't interest everybody. For such an expensive book the typesetting and general layout is not as good as it could be."
4,Warrior reviews Priest,"This book is a fine overview of the early progressive movement and the leading lights, Rossevelt and Wilson. Those who think Roosevelt was a conservative will be shocked to find that he was as least as radical, if not more so, than Wilson. Both thought Government was the answer to social problems. Both believed the central government needed to intervene in the economy. They made modern liberalism and bear the responsibility for the results."
3,"ok, but lacks depth and originality","When I picked this up, I thought: hey, why not two bios for the effort of one? Why not indeed: you can't delve deeply enough into these two substantial and complex lives in this context. THere is some useful comparisons made of their careers, but it is way way too ambitious. While you do get many of the factual basics, which were indeed interesting, neither of these past Presidents comes alive.REcommended only for the facts. Look for flavor and pyschological depth elsewhere."
4,Quality Radio,"This radio met all of my expectations. The sound is exceptional. My one complaint is that the backlit display is too bright even at the lowest setting and once the display is no longer lit, you cannot see the time or station playing. Also, once you turn it on you must manually change the display from the station playing to the time, it would be better if the display shifted back to the time after the station playing was displayed temporarily."
3,Good Radio,"Good Sound, needs more station presets. While I agree with most reviews that this radio has good sound, I'm just not sure its a $140 good."
5,Totally pleased,"I couldn't have asked for a better table radio. It is a marvel, really. From the substantial feel to the piano black wood finish to its make-no-compromises internals. The sound is perfectly balanced, the display is outstanding, the reception is stellar, and the other features are a bonus and plentiful. I recently looked at the competition at a bricks and mortar store and I am pleased to know that I indeed made the absolute right choice with this one. It may cost a bit more than the others, but every cent over is money well spent."
4,Sangean WR-2 radio,This little radio has amazing sound the best sound of any of the small radios including bose. Would have given it a 5 but couldn't get the automatic time set to work had to set the clock manualy.
1,Beware.,"Do not buy this unit if you expect it to:- provide better reception than you already have with your cheap pocket or table model- provide a nice digital clock read-out viewable from more than one foot away (Look at the picture provided that shows detail of the digital read-out. Decrease the contrast by about a thousand, and this is what you will actually get; you will NEVER see the digits as clearly, with the degree of contrast, as shown in this photo)Recommendation? Don't do what I did. Go to an ACTUAL STORE for your table radio; buy one that you can listen to, and see!BTW...the push buttons are slightly wider than pinheads, and the lettering for them just about the same size. Good luck for any of you who don't like to spend an hour with the manual and a week or two for the requisite learning curve."
2,Didn't Last Don't Like,"Bought one three years ago and am now looking for a new one. The radio cuts off for up to an hour or so once or twice a week, for no reason. Never did like how you have to play with the display everyday just to have the clock visible. The buttons are not comprehensive and after threes years I still haven't the dang thing memorized, so that I could hit the right button for the right function in the middle of the night, in the dark, for example. Too much bass, which you have no control over, disturbs the neighbors. Lousy reception, my 25 cent Salvation Army Special is a better radio by far. ."
2,Does not work for me!,"This is a cute little radio, but unfortunately it does not pick up my local PBS station, and it is surprisingly heavy. I live in a very hilly area and it just is not capable of grabbing the signal I guess. The few stations that I could get sounded kinda muffled and mediocre. I am really disappointed. The only way I seem to be able to listen to the radio is thru my computer or get some sort of big antenna, I have already tried small antennas."
5,Excelent Radio,This radio is one of the best clock radios that I have owned. Sound quality is very good. Controls are very easy to use. I love that the time is automatically set over the air. It also has an adjustment to change the brightness of the display from off to on and different degrees of brightness.
5,Exellent Radio,"We purchased this radio so that my wife could listen to her radio programs as she worked around the house. The portable radio that she was using had static, which at times made it difficult for her to listen to her programs in their entirety. I read the reviews on Amazon and decided to give the Sangean WR-2 a try ... it did not disappoint. The reception is orders of magnitude above what she had before. I have to admit that when I am in the computer room and she is listening to one of her programs, I can easily hear and understand what is being broadcast, which is not something that I could do before. With the old radio it was more like noise than an actual radio transmission. She is most pleased with the radio and I have to say that I am too; the improved reception and audio clarity is impressive."
2,Complicated settings,"If you are looking for a clock radio that is easy to set and quickly change the alarm settings this is not the radio for you in spite of the quality of the sound. The previous clock radio I had for 25 years (Nakamura) only required two buttons to change the alarm settings, this radio requires four buttons and wastes time. The previous radio also had two alarm settings. In addition if you want to see the time while the radio is playing you have to hit a button to disengage the song announcement feature. Besides all of this it is large for what is does, twice the size of my previous radio."
1,Lost the crisp sound- now tinny and can't get rid of staitic,The radio comes in a great package. It reminded me of days gone by. Plugged it in and searched for radio stations- all was great for about 6 months. Turned it on and it has already lost the deep sound I was used to receiving. I tried moving it to all areas of the home and nothing pulls in the reception.I am writing to the company to complain- it isn't worth more than 19.99 and only if you give it as a gift to someone you don't really like! I bought one for another person I LIKE and it is doing the same thing to her.
5,Suprised,"I'm the guy that never writes reviews, in fact this is my first review, but this one needed to be written. First, I live in a rural area outside of Austin, TX, and receiving AM and FM signals can be difficult. So, my criteria was reception and sound. Well, this radio does both. It pulls in stations from Dallas to Houston, and for me, that's wonderful. Second, the sound. It is clear and full. Just what I was looking for. Last, the alarm was easy to set (contradicting prior reviews) and I love the remote control. It has a classic look but with digital controls. Very cool. Simply put, It's truly a great radio."
2,Good Sound - Terrible Clock,Sounds great but hard to operate. Good for an office but not suitable as a bed-side clock radio. Screen and power button light are very bright. Has dedicated buttons for obscure features not available in USA but not for common tasks line enable/disable alarm.
2,Not for the nightstand,"This is a decent radio, but it doesn't belong on the night stand for 2 reasons:1. The display is back lit instead of just illuminating the lettering. That means there's a lot more light coming from this unit than is necessary. I have to turn off the display entirely at night and can't read the time if I wake up in the middle of the night.2. There is only 1 alarm setting and it takes a 3 key strokes of little buttons all next to each other to turn off the alarm. So, if you wake up early and want to turn off the alarm to spare your significant other, you have to fumble in the dark with a cryptic interface.It's too bad they didn't do enough user interface studies because the unit has a good radio and a nice look and feel. I'll keep it but move it to another room."
4,I love this radio!,EXCELLENT reception on AM and FM. AM is so much clearer than my Bose Wave. It must have a good filter to keep out the buzz.Sound is good. Only thing I would change is the thickness of the screen over the speaker. A thinner wire screen would make an even better sound. Right now it sounds good but has a hint of a hollow sound due to the thick wire screen. I wouldn't return this radio just because of that but needed to mention it.Also has bass and treble control with an impressive amount of bass output.I don't see how anyone can be disappointed with this radio.
4,Fun Movie,Great fun with Charles Laughton and story line that is well built. Marlene Detrich is a bit stiff but all in all we enjoyed the movie.
2,Astounding!,"The moment I received this eagerly awaited (5 stars) low-carb cookbook I immediately sat down and read it cover to cover--with a bottle of white-out to cover up all those exclamation marks. No one else has mentioned this feature of the book, but exclamation marks are all over the place: front cover, back cover, comments, directions, even in the ingredient lists. Please, I love the title of this book and hope to actually make some of these recipes! But please!! An editor (!) to remove all those !!!!!! marks would be great!!!!!"
5,Excellent cookbook for carb controlled diets,"I purchased two of these cookbooks, one for myself, low carber since 10/03 and one for a gift for my mother who has been enjoying the benefits of low carb eating for almost a year. The recipes are easy to follow and can be made with the basic staples of a low carb pantry. Sharron understands low carb and the need for easy to make entrees, side dishes and desserts. Be sure to try the Carmel Apple Cheesecake first! Yum!"
2,Poor FM and Non-existent AM,There was no AM reception. FM reception was poor. Returned it to the Radio Shack for a full refund. Skip it.
4,911 Porsche review,Quick review done by years as well as changes that take place during model years. Would like more photos but what is there is good.
4,"Very good, but watch out for duplication","If you own Mill Creek's ""50 Movie Pack: War Classics,""War Classics 50 Movie Pack Collectionthen you already have these discs. And if you don't, you'd be better off buying the larger collection, which includes eight additional DVDs.These four discs are quite good, and so is the quality. They provide a comprehensive overview of the war in both theaters."
4,No headaches with this one,"Like other reviewers I started with a Logitech Rumblepad and had no end of problems trying to configure it for different games, then half the time my PC couldn't find it on startup. I must have installed the drivers about a dozen times (they seemed to disappear off my system) before it went back to the store. I then came home with the MS Sidewinder, plugged it in...and I was off and running. The easiest installation possible, and no problems so far.I would have given it five stars, but it is a little lightweight and feels a bit flimsy, but other than that, it has been a joy compared to the Logitech."
1,A controller without a D-pad!,"Don't take the ""5 stars rating"" reviews in such consideration, because their owners don't seem to play many diferent type of games. It's directional pad is a COMPLETE JUNK. If you have emulators on your computer, like M.A.M.E, and usually play fighting games (Street Fighter, KOF etc...), FORGET it.It is also NOT recommended to play any other emulator games. PC games are also a hard task to do.Why?Simply because the D-pad doesn't work. It's almost IMPOSSIBLE to make the moves work well.The one star I gave goes to all the rest (I mean the buttons and the design).Stay away from any gamepad from MS. They are the worst choice."
3,MSD Wires On 2006 Grand Prix GT,"These wires are excellent. This particular application does not work well though. The boots are too long for this car. The ""6"" cylinder plug boot sits against the leading O2 sensor. Additionally all the wires are too short to route the same way as the factory wires. The shortness is most noticeable in the front cylinder bank. May want to rethink these wires if you intend on using them on a gm 3800."
3,A bit too much sugar in this cup?,"So, I got this for 25 cents at a used book sale, and figured as a teacher who is frustrated and burned out with ""the system,"" it was worth a shot. And it was, I suppose. It's kind of an overdose of sappy and saccharine stories, and I felt like all of the stories were edited in such a way that no one writer had an individual voice. It seemed like they all came from the same person (even though I know they didn't). But, a few of the stories in there left an impression on me, and it was a nice break from more ""serious"" reading."
1,"Mine arrived broken, too...","Just like a previous reviewer of this parts washer, mine arrived broken. The same problem he/she had, which was that the plastic link between the flexible metal nozzle and the pump were broken. That's despite an impeccable job of packing - as is typical of all things I've ever ordered via Amazon.com. I suspect it was a combination of poor product design and little or no factory quality control - but that's only my opinion. Since the lead time for ordering another said 2-3 months, I opted for a full refund and will look elsewhere. The plastic version sold by Harbor Freight is way too flimsy for me to consider. And anything larger than 3-4 gallon capacity is more than I really need or have storage for. Yeah, well..."
3,Drunk and disorderly,"This might have been a great set if Morrison wasn't so drunk. I mean he is really hammered, to the point of slurring lyrics. The band does a great job as usual, but there are better live recordings of the Doors out there."
5,"crudeza, poesia, alcohol..que esperabas de los doors??????????","hummm....sonido crudo..poesia derramada en forma desprolija..altanera...momentos brillantes, momentos erraticos...profundos baches, belleza de a golpes...en fin...monotono no es...sencillo de escuchar tampoco..pero creeme que te escupe en la cara el rock crudo, insensato, salvaje de estos cuatro jinetes fugados del apocalipsis!!!!!!!!!!!!! tomate un vino y escuchalo!!"
2,I Believe In Santa Clause,I love Christmas movies. That is why I purchased this one. I regret spending good money for it. First of all it was the worst visual movie I have ever seen. It looked like some high school kid filmed it. It was filmed in a different language and the english was dubbed in. A very bad job. It distracts from the movie when the words do not match the lips. The picture quality was fuzzie. The story was cute. The actors looked like they had never acted before.
5,This book is awesome,"I admit that when I bought this book, I didn't have very high expectations for it. I mean, I'd never heard of it before, but I took a chance and bought it anyway. And I loved it. The stories are all so different; some were funny, others were dark and foreboding, and some were exciting."
1,Defective,I had this butter dish about six weeks and when my husband tried to lift the lid to get to the butter (after being refrigerated) the knob on the top came over. I like the look of it and this brand has worked well for me in the past. When I tried to return in the return policy for this item was about 4 weeks. I am very disappointed that it could not be exchanged and therefore I won't be buying items like this any more.
1,Beautiful Dish but not functional...,"I ordered the Fiesta butter dish in Shamrock -- very pretty color. I really like Fiesta dishes, but the butter dish top just doesn't accommodate a standard 4 ounce block of butter. There is plenty of room on the base of the dish but the top just dangled on top of the butter. It's too narrow and short. Too bad -- I would have loved to have kept this butter dish had it worked! Fortunately, the return was easy and I received a credit right away."
2,Wrong Color Sent!,"I received this butter dish from my wedding registry, and it was the wrong color! I specifically requested this item in lemongrass on the registry, which is the yellow-green color (and I have a place setting to match, so I know what it's supposed to look like), the packing slip when I received the item said it was lemongrass (which means that the gift-giver ordered it correctly), but the item was actually a seafoam green. Not even remotely lemongrass."
5,Pretty and useful!,"I purchased this butter dish to sit out on my counter; my old butter dish did not have a handle on top so it was top priority to find a pretty butter dish that had a handle of some type. It sits out on my black granite counter top with organic, grass-fed butter in it, and looks beautiful. I believe this dish would go with many decorating styles; my kitchen is sort of French Country. I also purchased the spoon rest in the same color and am pleased with it."
2,Way too small!,"On the plus side, it's nice to have the knob, and it's a nice color. But it ought to be functional - it's too small for a stick of butter. The lid doesn't sit all the way down because a standard stick is too tall for it. Then butter gets all inside the lid, and you don't want to put it down because you'll get butter on the table. It makes me wonder if anyone at the factory ever tried to use one - they'd know right away it's too small."
3,Fiesta butter dish,"This is a pretty little butter dish, but I wish I had known in advance that it is sized for the longer, skinnier butter sticks. The shorter, fatter type (such as the Kirkland brand from Costco) are a tight fit, and the cover touches the top of the butter. Specific to the cobalt blue, it's a much deeper blue than the picture appears. For me, this was a plus."
5,sturdy,This butter dish is very durable. It's heavy-weight and washes well in the dishwasher. It's also roomy. No smooshed butter on the sides of the top!
3,Not So Red,"Finding red butter dishes is not easy. This one had a nice classic shape that fits well with our modern decor. Unfortunately, it is not nearly as red as it appears on my computer screen. Wish I had checked out what Fiesta's red looks like in a store before I bought it. In the meantime, it's good enough."
4,returned it!,"It did NOT match the sugar and creamer set that it was ordered with, so I returned it. Did not reorder, as I feared I would get the wrong color again."
2,"Works decent, wont keep racoons out though.","Door installs relatively easy, pets figured it out rather easily. Had some difficulty finding a dog collar that would work with the transmitter. Took the racoon about 15 seconds to figure out how to pull the flap open from the outside. Should keep the neighbor cat out though!"
4,Good little door,"It's a fine little door & easy to install. Our Cocker Spaniel likes it but wishes we had gotten one just a little larger, say and inch each way."
2,"disjointed, meandering and ultimately not affective","Throughout my reading of this book I was anxiously awaiting the point where I would be impacted by the large, important, affecting themes Sebald confronts. It never happened.The book tells the story of four different characters that left their native land, and settled elsewhere. They all suffer from deep depression and have some connection to the Holocaust. None of their lives intersect, although they share this similar past. The individual stories aimlessly move through each of the character's past with a tepid tone and abrupt, unfulfilled ending. None of the characters are particularly interesting, and those that have an unusual story - like an unlikely feted artist - are stripped of any life through a centerless story.For those that are interested in the areas of emigration, the Holocaust - read some other novels/factual accounts. Afterwards, think about them as a whole and you'll be greatly more affected than these four sterile accounts."
3,Good read for the melancholic,"This was my second book by Sebald and like Austerlitz, I experienced a deep, almost surreal sense of gloom as flashes of images kept playing in my mind. It was so hypnotic - I almost felt like I was floating in air. I attribute it to Sebald's unique talent -- he's able to lead readers to a totally new plane, so to speak, where the plot of the story becomes so secondary -- all that matters is the journey and the sense of how the characters' thoughts and pain become yours.That said, this book (and Austerlitz) isn't exactly for everyone. I've tried recommending it some friends who felt it was too ""meandering and emotive"". I didn't quite agree with them, but lately, I'm beginning to see their point -- you've got to be in a right frame of mind to enjoy Sebald. If you're a sucker for plot-drive, high-octane stories, then this may not be for you, but if you're more contemplative and patient, this could be the most rewarding book you'll read in a long while."
3,Welsh lite,"By no means as cutting edge as Trainspotting or as just bloody brilliant as Marabou Stork nightmares, Glue will nonetheless appeal to most Welsh fans."
4,Good but not great,"This book expands on the world created in Trainspotting, a social study on 4 boys becoming men and coping through poverty, drugs, etc.It's not Trainspotting, a book I fear all Welsh's work will be compared with, but it's a fast paced highly enjoyable read."
4,"12"" & 8"" Goniometer Set","Easy to transact, arrived in fewer days than stated. Work well for measuring a variety of joints. Two for the price of one."
2,Flimsy,I work in home care and my goniometer comes in and out of my bag often. This one was not up to the task and it broke after a few uses. It is made out of flimsy plastic.
2,VERY beginner!,"I read the reviews here on amazon and still purchased this video anyway. I was thinking, ""well hey I am a beginner (and might I add out of shape) so this should be great for me for awhile"". I was wrong. I was expecting the bunny slope of skiing and instead got the little hill in the front yard of your house. My heart rate did not notably elevate, nor could I feel any of the toning in my body (normally I get sore).The stretches are great, though. This video is very relaxing. I think it would be good to use on a day you are sore from doing something else the previous day."
2,A good way to relax,"If you want a real workout, this isn't the video for it. I doubt anyone would have any results as far as improved muscle tone solely from doing this video. That said, however, the the stretches are quite relaxing. The music, set and even Deason's voice are all very calming as well.Make sure you have the exact size of excercise ball specified on the back cover. Mine is slightly smaller and I think it made some of the stretches a little less fluid.I doubt I'll get much use out of this video, but it might be nice every now and then as a stress reliever."
5,perfect!,new parents w/large & small dogs. was easy and fast to instal. purchased 2 more bc it works so well. fast shipping!
3,Serves most of its purpose,"This gate is perfect if the opening your trying to block is the EXACT measurement with or without the extensions. I am using this for the top of the stairs without any extensions. It fits, but I had to take out the extra plastic pieces on one of the sides that are used to tighten and loosen the gate. The gate does NOT close on its own. Possibly because it is not set up perfectly. It does serve its purpose though, it is tight enough so my baby will not be able to push it down. Sometimes it doesn't click closed right, again, probably because it is not perfect. My recommendation, measure the EXACT doorway this is to be used for and go by that. if it is off, then I do not recommend this gate. Its too bad there isn't a little more flexibility with where it can fit."
5,Great Purchase,"I did some research before purchasing these gates. I'm using them to keep our dog out of an area of the house. It allows her to see through, which is nice. Tall enough so that if she gets on her hind legs, she won't jump over. Installation was easy enough to do alone without damaging my walls. I like the fact that an extension is included as well. The look is clean and neat and the gate is very easy to use. Well worth the money."
5,Great baby and pet gate,I have a small dog and three grandkiddos that visit a lot. I wanted to keep them all downstairs. This gate is secure and quite. Love the self closing feature. Had it set up in less than ten minutes. The gate is also attractive what a bonus.
5,"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, Black","Very nice and well built gate. It is very easy to install. Best buy for your money.I would highly recommend this gate for anyone.Very fast shipping, received in two days."
3,Great Sounds from a Great Artist,This CD is full of great music. If you have the original BVSC then you have a good idea of what to expect. The only reason I don't like this CD as much is that there isn't as much diversity as there is in the original album. Nonetheless this CD does contain a lot of great music and will truly get you tapping your toe at times.
4,Understated charm poured from aged barrels,"Warm, comforting, and somehow familiar -- whether or not you understand the Spanish. Ferrer's voice is definitely weatherbeaten, but the roughness is consistently charming, and he can surprise you with the power of his high notes. (Intriguing lyrics, too: you don't hear many songs elsewhere about green plantains.) One imagines older couples moving gracefully around a Havana dance floor, creaky in the knees but full of inner fire. A lesson in suave."
3,Drowned out,"If you saw the film and expected to actually be able to enjoy this recording, think again. The simplicity of the first recordings and the film, not to mention the wonderful voice of Ibrahim Ferrer are overwhelmed by inappropriate orchestration filled with schmaltzy violins and brass which drowns out the vocal music. Gone are the campesino musicians and their instruments. Enter Hugo Winterhalter. These arrangements obliterate every smidgen of charm and, against the odds, manage to make what is vibrant sound old and dated. It's a shame that so much intimacy and beauty was lost by expanding to a cast of thousands. Ibrahim deserves better. So do we."
1,meh...,"Another reviewer here has stated that the author should perhaps have written a historical fiction influenced by Leveau, like what Atwood did with Grace Marks in ""Alias Grace"".To be honset, I wouldn't have read the book then either. That's because I can't read this book without feeling... well... search inside and read a brief excerpt. The writing reads like a freshman comp paper. I can't take it seriously because the author's put so much fluff into it.Check it out for yourself, but read the excert before you go out and actually blow some scratch on this book. Who exactly is she qouting in that first chapter?Bah... if you're interested in Marie Leveau, a topic worthy of interest; then I recomend Long's investigation into the who Marie Leveau was. It too, has it's short-comings, but I assure you that it is more worth your time than this."
3,2 1/2 stars.,"BEER BARREL POLECATS is a pretty disappointing short. The scene where the Stooges make beer is funny. But the scenes in jail are disappointing. The new scene where Curly mistakingly socks Vernon Dent is funny, but Curly was sick here. To make the short easier, they reused large amounts of stock footage from IN THE SWEET PIE AND PIE and SO LONG, MR. CHUMPS. Those original shorts were better and funnier. Plus, if you didn't see SO LONG MR. CHUMPS in the first place, you wouldn't understand this short. The Stooges are looking for convict #41144, but why? Watch SO LONG, MR. CHUMPS instead.THREE SMART SAPS is a lot funnier than the previous. Curly's dancing scenes are the funniest part of the short.MONKEY BUSINESSMEN- This is the first short that included co-star Kenneth MacDonald. This short is pretty funny, but Curly's sickness is too noticeable.I give this tape 2 1/2 stars. The quality is far too bright."
3,Stooges are GREAT!! Video is BAD!!,"There is only one reason to purchase this video: ""Beer Barrel Polecats"". While all of the shorts on this compilation are hilarious and grade-A Stooge shorts, the video itself has a big downfall. The first short, ""Beer"", looks like it has been given the pristine transfer treatment but the other two shorts look as if someone held a hand camera up to a 16mm screen. They are washed out and shady. I've seen these on AMC's airring of the Stooges and they look a lot better. I would expect this from the low-budget video companies but not Columbia. It was a disappointment. Be warned, if you think you will be getting nice clean copies of these Stooge shorts. This video does not do them justice."
1,No wonder they called it MAD-This thing's UNCONTROLLABLE!,"I usually do not write reviews unless the product I am writing about is either excellent, or very very poor. Unforunately for Mad Catz, I strongly dislike this controller for Xbox. Its control sticks are far too sensitive! Whatever springs or mechanisms which hold the sticks to their usual upright position must be weak because they are far to easy to move around. This weakness causes me to miss my Shots in Halo and make overly sharp turns in my racing games. If you're thinking this is because the sensitivity is turned up too high on my games, you're wrong. At the same game configurations for controller sensitivity, CONTROLLER S IS FAR MORE CONTROLLABLE. Even though one star is the lowest Amazon.com will let one rate an item, I believe 0 stars would be far more accurate. Save your money; don't buy this controller."
3,good but may break easy,This product is great as I drive a scooter so I can open up the garage without carrying a huge opener but I am on my second one as the last on broke (just stopped working) only 4 months after getting it.
1,Been too long,I really dont remembe why we got this? but since I have to leave a comment of so many words there you are!
5,The best,"You have to be careful with this one -- there are several different recordings from the same concert weekend available -- the one referenced here is the album released by BMG Classical in the mid 1990s. It's also available on DVD. This is my favorite of all Mahler recordings, and one of my favorite symphonic recordings of all time.There is magic happening here... with Tennstedt, with every single musician in the orchestra. The orchestra gives every note significance, and there is not one mistake of intonation, rhythm, dynamics. This is a masterpiece of phrasing, emotion, triumph and despair. This synergy in a classical recording only happened one other time -- in a historic performance from the 1950s with Fritz Reiner and the same orchestra, recording Weinberger's ""Polka and Fugue"" from Schwanda the Bagpiper. Listen to this recording and see for yourself... you'll be transported to a wonderful place by this music."
4,to life emortal!,"first and formost,the reveiwers who say the show has'nt age well are partialy right.they're also partialy right about the acting and special effects being horrible.BUT by the time of episode ""thy kingdom come"" the show finds its footing and gets better,and darker,better directed and better acted.the show really still holds up by the time you get to this episode.watching this just bring back a flood of memories from middle school.i am in the process of watching volume 2 of season one,and can't wait for the even darker but inconsistant second season."
3,Aliens like Pinky and the Brain,I remember the series from when I was a kid and would watch anything sci-fi. I recently purchased season one and have had a lot of fun watching the horrible story lines and bad acting. One thing I have noticed again and again in season one is how like Pinky and the Brain the aliens are. They come up with elaborate plots to take over the world and the whole episode is about getting one element of the plot that fails in the end. Like robbing armored cars to buy rubies to power lasers!! Breaking into a power plant to steel a generator to power a devise to knock out the phone company thereby causing confusion in the public and allowing the aliens to take over!! Watch the show in the same mind set as you would Pinky and the Brain and you might enjoy it. I did.
1,a pale try to make money,this is a very poor excuse for a series that tried to hook it's coat tails to the better than ever 1953 movie. the show was a waste of time then(1988) and it waste time now!!!!!!
3,Great movies but bad package,"When I opened the package, my blue-ray cover for National Security was heavily heat damaged with plenty of wrinkles. Disk worked fine, but no Blue-ray live content accessible. It seems as though Sony has removed support for the Blue-ray Live feature for the disk."
2,Cheap,"I read previous reviews and on that I purchased the headphone. The foam ear piece was separated in the packaging and could not stay attached. In that process the headphone felt like a cheap piece of plastic and nothing of any quality to it. I never did actually get to try it out to,listen to the quality of the sound.."
5,A good investment.,This cookware set is about the best purchase I have made. I am very happy with the cookware and would but this set again. The pans and lids are very high quality and look like they will last my lifetime (and then some).
1,A waste of time and money,"This is a very short video of various buildings within Damascus. You get no feeling for the city, people, or culture. Save your money. It was a waste of time."
3,This book is OK but not great,Not too many secrets are revealed in this book as the title implies. The chapter on Lou Simpson is great! The rest of the book is only mildly interesting. This book is worth reading but probably only for Berkshire enthusiasts.
4,BUFFETT RULES,"Warren Buffett is the god of investors. Thus, there's a plethora of books about him and his investing methods. Reading anything Buffett says is good. My concern with these books is they become dated very fast. For example, right now, in mid 2007, Warren is buying up railroad stocks, specifically Burlington Northern. Yet we don't glean that from this book, because it went to print before Warren got into RR's.I've read most of the Buffett books and this one is above average. Recommended.Also, for those desiring to become rich, check out Tom Stanley's ""The Millionaire Mind.""The Millionaire Mind"
1,i dont even know what it is,I don't know even know what it is because it does not show a picture. When you try to sell something you should put a picture.
2,Not very good by Biohazard standards...,"This is undoubtebly one Of the Bio's weakest albums. I just can't get into it. At this stage of their career they had lost their way slightly. There are a couple of ok songs like 'Resist' and 'Dogs of war', but the rest of it is just rap-metal crap. This and Uncivilisation are their worst efforts. I picked up Kill or be killed recently and was really impressed by what I heard. As for those idiots who said Biohazard is jumping on the 'metalcore' bandwagon, they created this sound you morons, some 10 years ago!"
2,Definitely not the best from Biohazard,"I was never a big fan of ""New World Disorder"" since it's release in 1999, and I was afraid when I first heard this album that Biohazard was starting to lose their edge. Thankfully, I was wrong, but ""New World Disorder"" remains one of the few lowpoints for this otherwise incredible band. Songs like ""Switchback"", ""End of My Rope"", and ""Skin"" just seem so generic, so un-Biohazard that it makes me scratch my head at wondering if the band was trying to be more successful comemrcially here with this album. After all, this was released at nu-metal's height where it seemed any band with a rapping singer and downtuned guitars managed to sell a million albums in a week. While this album does have a few bright spots, this is definitely not Biohazard's finest hour. Check out ""State of the World Address"", the classic ""Urban Discipline"", ""Mata Leao"", ""Uncivilization"", and the recent ""Kill or Be Killed"" if you want to hear some of this band's best."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR BIOHAZARD FANS-,Definitely one of their best albums. These guys are at Pantera level. This album is true Biohazard. Anyone who dislikes this album can't be a true Biohazard fan.
4,Could've been better,"This Cd was alright.It would've been better if the tempo would've been a little faster.Otherwise, a CD worth buying"
1,Great Coaster!,"Hey there hear me out, this cd has incredible potential. However, to say that this cd is not the best is as severe an understatement as it gets. The choruses made me resort to using the cd as a coaster. Seriously! Don't even consider buying this cd. The people who gave it 5 stars are probably mentally handicapped."
4,A Must Have boating Item for Offshore,I purchased this for use on my 24ft CC. Never thought that I would need it but ends up I did. We lost our engine heading in with a Thunder Storm behind us. Ended up riding it out with 25-30kt winds and 4-6 swells with chop. It was nasty to say the least. We deployed the drift sock and it worked very well in keeping our bow into the waves. Without it no telling where we would have ended up and in what shape we would have been in. Since then I have used it on several fishing trips to slow our drift and it has worked very well. This is no sea anchor but on a smaller boat it works very well and is much easier to deploy and retrieve.
3,Thunder Warrior Rocks!,"The main reason I bought this DVD was for the movie Thunder Warrior. A great (Spaghetti Western Style) action movie about a man pushed to his limits! It is very much like Rambo except for the fact that it is a low-budget production. Mark Gregory plays Thunder and also stars in some other great cult films like Bronx Warriors 1990, Escape from the Bronx, Thunder Warrior 1 & 2, War Bus Commando. There is plenty of action, car chases and explosions! The voices are dubbed but I think that makes movie even better, like an old Bruce Lee flick! The quality of this film isn't the best picture quality but the only copy availible on DVD I have found."
5,Nice product,"This spray is great, not so strong that other people will affended. Spray on body and then just a little on shirt."
2,"If you know google, you don't need this book","This is a book for parents and children who are completely in the dark about google. It's the largest, most used search engine out there. Quite frankly, who doesn't know about Google at this point in time. Also, the links mentioned in this book that will be ""maintained"" and ""monitored"" and etc.--shouldn't parents be monitoring the sites that their children visit? Does anyone know the involvement and the amount of manpower this will take for a company to monitor ALL of these links? Next to impossible..yet only time will tell. What happened to good-old-fashioned Make Way for Ducklings? What about time away from ""the web"". DK is really for youngsters who can't read. YES, DK books are full of gorgeous pictures, but that's about...this is a hyped up title. You don't need it. Two stars for effort...I guess they are trying to keep up with technology?"
4,Excellent Maritime Story,"From an ""Old Sea Dog"" comes this riveting story of his teenage years in the 'Senior Service'. I read the copy I bought for my brother, an ex RN sailor. It was not my intention, but after reading the first few pages, I couldn't put it down. You will find, as I did, that a very interesting biography has been written by Anthony Dalton about the compelling yarn-spinning Tristan Jones (Wayward Sailor). It appears that Heart of Oak is a mixture of fact and fiction. It does not though detract from the compelling storytelling."
4,Great stuff...,"If you liked the Shangri-La album, this is a must buy. I think a lot of other reviewers have expounded more than I'm going to, but the tracks are much more alive here. My favorite tracks from here are Rudiger and Song for Sonny Liston. Everybody Pays is great here as well. Several songs here were not performed live on his last tour, so tis great to get to hear them in a live setting. Back to Tupelo and Stand up guy were not played at my concert, and likely weren't played elsewhere. Even if there is a live album, the quality of sound here should top it. Only 8 songs...but each one is flawless, and provides many more details and subtleties than the original album recordings."
3,good but not great,this is a good live album/ep. The mastering is excellent and MK sounds great as usual. The problem I have is that the content is not really that different from the Shangri La album...I did expect more extended live version.
3,One take radio sessions,I thought it was a new album but it was not it was songs from his last album in one take I guess. My fault for not researching longer but Mark still rocks and I saw him in concert fantastic. Just don't be disapointed when you have heard them all before.
3,It will shrink,"This item will shrink a big time after you wash it. Do not dry it with high heat dryer. This item is 100% cotton. If you worry about the shrinkage, then get the one that is 100% polyester."
4,Brilliant!,"The Jabberwocky has always been one of my favorite poems, so I was thrilled when I saw this book on sale at the book store. My children (ages 7, 4, and 2) love the dioramas, and ask me to read the book all of the time. My only complaint is that the paper used in the dioramas, while not super thin, is a bit fragile to be looked at too often and I'm worried about this book wearing out soon. As long as you don't let kids handle the book on their own, or you make sure they're EXTREMELY gentle with it, this book has great illustrations that really hold the attention of children."
5,A Cute Splash of Pink!,"I bought this for my Aunt as a birthday gift. I told her she could use it to serve something sweet or to put her rings in on her dresser. I quickly ordered a few for myself to use to serve a ladies tea. They are just about as big as my hand, but they make a large statement."
1,No Twisted Ends!,"I wanted short speaker wire with TWISTED ENDS! This was a total wast of money, since it had no ends at all."
5,NICKY DEPAOLA ! EXQUISITE VOICE!!!,"""UPTOWN MOOD"" WHAT A CLASSIC CD! NICKY DEPAOLA IS THE OLD SCHOOL VOCALIST THAT TAKES US BACK TO THE DAY WHEN SONGS OF LOVE AND SADNESS, COULD BE FELT WITH THE EMOTION AND PASSION,OF LOVE GONE WRONG. HIS TAKE ON ""ANGEL EYES"" and ""A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A FOOL"" ARE CLASSIC!!! YOU CAN HEAR IT IN HIS VOICE THAT HE has BEEN THERE,as HE TAKES YOU THERE.I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE HIS ACT IN RENO and HE WAS WONDERFUL! ALL OF US GIRLS THINK HE IS SOOO HANDSOME TOO! HE TRULY SINGS WITH ALL OF HIS HEART and SOUL.I WONDER WHY HE HAS NOT HIT IT BIG YET?? I KNOW HE'S BEEN AROUND FOR SOME TIME, I HOPE HE GETS A BREAK SOON, EVERYONE should KNOW WHO NICKY D. IS. WE ALL LOVE HIM, MY SIX SISTERS and ME, MOM TOO! HOPE TO SEE HIM AGAIN SOON at The PEPPERMILL CASINO in 2004."
5,Poignant and historically accurate.,"This poignant and historically accurate tale that has emerged through the author's detailed recollections is astounding. In his incarnation as the master shipbuilder, his name was Thomas Andrews, a man of great integrity and rare character. It is a truly fascinating story, told with adeptness and truthfulness.The story is getting worldwide attention and lots of sincere praise from the reincarnation experts. In any case, if one is to believe Tommie's story -- and, after hearing these amazing recordings, there's little room for doubt -- that Tommie designed a masterful ship; it was greed and politics that sank the Titanic."
1,Don't Judge a Book by its Tilte,"This book subtitled ""Titanic Secrets Revealed Thru The Eyes Of Her Builder"" was enough for this reader to purchase this book. Don't make the same mistake. This book is really just a historical novel. Ths clincher with this book is. ""Revealed thru the eyes of her builder"" means some American from Cleveland has become a shipbuilder's ""Bridey Murphy"". Receivng information about the defects in the Titanic from the long dead builder speaking through this author. Coincendently the ""builder's conclusion as to why the Titanic sank is the same as the episode on the Discovery Channel's Titanic Documentary.I recommend the Discovery Channel on this one. My main gripe is the title gave no hint that the source of information is on shakey ground to say the least."
2,Amazon rip off 2,"Amazon offered a bonus for purchasing Calphalon pots that I never received because the orders were split and they refused to honor it. Next time, I will order directly through the vendor or shop in person for this type of purchase - the vendor did their part efficiently. The pot is well worth the money and I take care to heat and cool it slowly to avoid any possibility of warping."
3,Reasonably good BDSM stories,"""Roughed Up"" is a collection of gay bdsm stories, most of which are written from a sub point of view. Most of it is of reasonably good quality, certainly better than most of the free stories one can find on the internet, making it at least worth spending money on. A few stories are actually original and use striking themes, such as the first, about taking revenge on a dom who stole someone's boyfriend, or a story where a crucifixion theme plays a major role.Nevertheless the authors often can't choose very well between telling a story and making it erotic, so that some of the stories are rather unbalanced. Also, very little attention is paid to particular kinks or variation in the 'types' involved, making it rather vanilla within the context of bdsm fantasy. In a field allowing for so much creativity, the results are a little bland."
2,"Some advance warning, please?","I had no idea what to expect from this, and am still not sure how this pair of sketch comedy shorts featuring Jim Norton, Lewis Black, Greg Fitzsimmons, and Jim Gaffigan among others can be rated, or even explained as they are presented. Vaudeville and Laural & Hardy-inspired as these skits are, there is little to explain their concept or even what we are watching. On the DVD are two skits. That's about it. No interviews, no extra footage to invite the viewer into the concept, nothing.That's not to say that some of the performances weren't well done. The ideas for these pieces do seem like they were good ones; I am, however, left with an empty feeling after. In the descriptive terms that Lewis Black has himself used in the past, A Pair of Lewis Black Shorts come up short and to many will come across as proverbial candy corn."
4,From Past to Present,"Reminiscent of the highly sought after WWII era Fiestaware, this beautifully crafted pitcher remains true to the boldness of color and durable quality that endeared Fiestaware into the hearts of our mothers and has made it a prized collectable. With a 56 oz. capacity this dishwasher safe pitcher is perfect for cooling summer afternoons with iced tea or lemonade. Crafted with durability for regular use and a lead free glaze, this pitcher ensures a lasting brightness of color and to endure the test of time. The traditional ring design of Fiestaware appearing on the pitcher coordinates it withother pieces of Fiestaware, both antique and modern, to compliment a set to be displayed, as well as used, and cherished through generations."
4,Authenticity,I am a long time fan of Catherine Cookson and have probably read most of her books. The film adaptations have been pretty faithful to the books and the production values have been top notch. It looks like a whole studio has been created just for her books! Any Cookson fan would be pleased with the transiton of her books to film.
2,KH2 Guide,Now KH2 is a very easy game so I personally dont think a guide should be bought.Now for one they give a map in this game which is very useful and the maps are very easy to locate so their isnt much of a problem their.Secondly health items are very common and you can buy them from moogles.And lastly it feels so much better knowing you beat the game by yourself
1,The science is there but the explaining is bad.,"When I first started studying from this book I was overwhelmed. There was a lot of equations. I dug deeper into the book to try an understand the science but it did not go well. I figured it was me. Maybe I was not intelligent enough to understand the science. However, I latter concluded that was not true. I took some of the equations and concepts in the book and looked them up online and in other books. I did not have trouble understanding any of it elsewhere; I picked up on and understood the science well. Based on that I had to conclude that it was not my intellect but rather how the book is written. It was a logical conclusion as I only had a lack of ability to understand this science from this book. I am very disappointed because this book is covers all the topics on the mcat."
4,Great product!,"I've had the Norpro Tortilla Pancake Keeper for over a year now and am very satisfied with it. I had wanted to get an actual clay tortilla warmer, but in a household full of small children I knew it would not be long before it was chipped or broken so I opted for the synthetic style instead. It is great. I used it for tortilla, pancakes, waffles, muffin, biscuits, ect. It hold the warmth wonderfully for 45 min to and hour. Glad I purchased it."
4,really good movie,for fans of horror and the friday the 13 ths go get this it is a good one to watch the only thing about the blu ray is that it does have quite a few blurry scenes. i dont know what they were thinking but they should have done a lil better.
4,Friday 13th,I thought this was a remake of the original movie and not a sequel but hey it was well done for a slasher movie. Guy playing Jason was bad ass and at least this time he really moved instead of just walking!
1,How does eating broccoli for 9 hours sound??,"Yes the information is interesting but unfortunately not practical in the slightest. I would have imagined a diet called 'the evolution diet' would be based around fruits, veg and meat. This diet however calls for buttered toast and orange juice for breakfast followed by 9 hours of broccoli and banana or Triscuit crackers and carrots. A chicken wrap or burrito for dinner is hardly what 'natural' man (or the 'Hunter Gatherer') was eating in Central Africa!. I wouldn't be wasting your money on this one - borrow from the library for a laugh because it seems like that's what the author is doing all the way to the bank - while eating his danish, bagel and orange juice might I add(pg 70)."
1,"Junk science, silly diet, bad prose.","I was wondering what foods humans evolved eating and if it would be sensible to eat predominately those foods nowadays, so I bought _The Evolution Diet_. It has nothing to do with any of that. I expected it to discuss evolution and early human diets, and why certain foods are more suitable for humans than others. It doesn't. I expected it to make scientifically supported claims about diet and nutrition. It doesn't. When it does cite a source, it's often an article in _Redbook_, not a peer reviewed one from the likes of _Nature_. The book is high-school-term-paper-grade fluff surrounding a weight loss plan. And here's what the book advises: eat very little, exercise on most days, and only eat protein after you exercise."
3,"Great read except for the main character's ""romance""","A great edition to the supernatural/mystery genre. Sam Casey, the main character, is a weak woman but she is well-written. Her relationship with Jake is disturbing. She allows him to belittle her privately and humiliate her publically. Together they are disturbing enough to make me consider quitting the series but the storytelling keeps me coming back. Maybe I will get lucky and Sam will eventually kick the abusive and withholding Jake to the curb."
4,Missing some of the greats,Really enjoyed the songs that I was unaware of. I grew up listening to Stuart's Spell of the Yukon album and was diappointed that not a single one of those is on this release. I hope that more of his work will be released in the future.
3,An Excellent Retort,"This song is an awesome and funny come back to TLC's ""No Scrubs"". However it got annoying... just like No Scrubs."
5,Descriptive and Useful,Very clearly written! I really like the separation of technical research information from the layman's discourse. It is easy to understand and applicable to everyone in parenting.
4,This book was amazing!,My anticipation of our new arrival promted me to buy this book. My wife and I loved it! It will stay in our library for future pick ups. To become a partent is a scary responsibility and we wanted to be as prepared as we could from the onset. This book puts issues in a way to help you realize your kids don't have to take on your own past problems and how to avoid while preparing them for their own life. So many great ideas in it!
3,Not too much bang for the buck,"There are a couple of useful chapters in here, well written, etc., but most seemed old news. I've yet to read Developing Mind, and I'm hoping that that will be much better and more original. Siegel is a great lecturer, so I was expecting more. Basically, this book is about being aware of the traumatic, disconnecting experiences one has had in order to stop the cycle of anger, reactivity, etc., that comes from unconscious conflict."
5,The BEST parenting book out there!,"If you can handle some somewhat heavy, technical reading, I believe the heart and soul of this book will shout out loud and clear: Emotional Intelligence and the understanding of Attachment Theory is key to becoming a great parent. As a Christian counselor focused on a developmental perspective, I spend a good deal of my time with the youth and family population. I am also an EMDR therapist working with adolescents and adults with issues of childhood trauma. Multi generational patterns, family systems issues and attachment/relational styles play a key role in effective parenting and this book does a wonderful job of illuminating us to these facts. I plan on using this book as a meaningful reference in my upcoming classes and seminars. An excellent follow up read is ""Why You Do The Things You Do"" by Dr. Tim Clinton and Dr. Gary Sibcy."
1,Horrible,"I found this book to be horrible. Hard to read and understand. It seems that the author continually repeats himself over and over. I was unable to finish this book and would not recommend it to anyone. I've been told the author of the book is a pioneer in his field and is wonderful to hear speak, just unable to put his talks into writing in a way to convey his message. Look elsewhere for a practical and informative read."
2,Great content but poor transfer to video,"I love the series, but the transfer to DVD is poor. It compares poorly to a regular DVD movie, and also to the quality you will see on HDNET, where I first started watching the series. This tells me the source material is OK but the transfer is sloppy. I think this series was originally shot on film, which means this could be extremely crisp. On the first episode I could see major halos around the uniforms in the scene where Archer was talking Hoshi into coming on the trip while she was in South America. There is a lot of grain and fuzinees to the picture. This has nothing to do with the limitations of the media. It's just a quick and dirty transfer to DVD.What a waste."
3,"Enterprise was great, but the price is exorbanant!","Considering that almost every other TV show costs about $20 to $30 per season, there is no reason for this to cost over $120. It costs 3 times that. The producers of star trek need to realize that there are tons of fans that would buy this at a more reasonable price. I for one would buy the full series of TNG and Enterprise. Instead, I have bought non of them.Great show, just overpriced."
1,Mickey is a Brown Shirt?!?,"While Giroux asks a few good questions, I can't take seriously the suggestion that Disney animations are sexist, racist, or anti-democratic. Space limitations prevent a full rebuttal, but if Giroux went after Santa Claus, I bet he'd be a gluttonous, chain-smoking, reindeer abusing, elf oppressing, break-and-enter man with an unnatural fixation on young children. If you want to read how he does a job like this on ""The Lion King"" and other great movies, this is the book for you."
4,Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E. The 15 years later Affair,"It was cool to see ""the men"" after 15 years and to relive all the cool gadgets and situations that they get themselves into trying to rid the world of Thrush. The plot behind the story was similar to the series. I was interest to see how the guys aged after 15 years and how well they performed after being apart for so long. Being a U.N.C.L.E. fan, I enjoyed it as it turned out to be exactly like one of the stories in the saga."
1,It worth 1 US dollar!,"I got it from a record shop when the yare doin' clearance,it cost me $5 Hong Kong Dollar, about Less than 1 US Dollar,I don't know why MC Eiht keep sayin' ""Geah"" when song start,he say ""Geah"" or ""Gea Geah"" in ALL song, yes, ALL SONGS!!!really agony and foolish......have some ok song,really not a bad album, but can't make you love it,and you got zillion other choose to purchase, not this one!DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS IT COST YOU 1 DOLLAR!"
4,its cool,ON SECTION 8 EIHT CAME THROUGH ON THIS ONE.THIS ALBUM IS WAY BETTER THAN HIS LAST ALBUM LAST MAN STANDING.PRODUCTIONS AND LYRICS ARE WAY BETTER.I DONT KNOW WHAT EIHT WAS TALKIN ABOUT ON LAST MAN STANDING.ITS BETTER THAN DEATH THREATZ.HE HAD BETTER LYRICS FOR EXAMPLE THAN MO SHOOTIN MO BUCKIN MO SLICIN AND DICIN AND WHATEVER.THIS IS EIHTS BEST WORK SINCE MUSIC TO DRIVE BY. I WASN'T GOIN TO BUY THIS BUT I COULDN'T BEILVE IT SOUNDED COOL.BUT LETS SEE IF THIS ALBUM SELLS SINCE HIS LAST 2 ALBUMS FLOPPED.
5,A JOYful reading experience,"This book was a JOYful reading experience. This books was very realistic in that it dealt with a very touchy subject matter, a woman who is pregnant as a result of rape.It made me question myself and I don't think I could have been as strong as Anya was in this situation. Her strength and faith are a testament to anyone going through a difficult situation.Weeping may endure for a night, but JOY comes in the morning.Bravo!!!"
2,too much info,"This book is by no means simple. (I am aware that much knowledge is needed to start a horse.) If you never started a horse before, my opinion is to have a knowledgable horseperson there with you to help you, not this book. This book was hard to read, there was no real ""program"" to follow, and it seemed to be geared towards just english riding. If you're a fan of the author you may like this book. I didn't find much use for it."
4,Short Stories of the 3rd Kind,"These are short stories -very short, but packed with the love of language. Lish uses the vernacular, in particular, stereotypical Jewish, in a unique way. (There was even a law suit involving a professor that was sued -sucessfully- by Lish concerning his unique style). They are hilarious and should be read aloud, because it's like being on stage. These stories are really comments on life, containing the histories of the people in them. What a schtick!"
2,Riker the clown arriving at circus Excalibur!,"I find this book poor and does not seem to belong to the series. Riker seems to be out of character, meets the crew of USS Excalibur, Capt Calhoun's ship and gets into humorous situations and he says 'I just got to get off this ship!' upon meeting Exalibur's command staff. Riker is there only for comic relief. There seems to be a lot of discussion of this sex-bomb. Too much seems to dwell on issues that does not concern plague. It took a long time before I realise the architect of the plague was being referred to and this story is where the villain gets defeated. A real let-down for an ending after the build-up in the earlier stories.Note that Riker is my favourite character in STTNG series and I like Capt Calhoun too. Peter David is also one of my favourite Star Trek author.This story is such a let down."
4,Peter David - same old,"This book was just like nearly all the other Peter David books - very interesting, very well-written, very funny and packed with a few two many plugs for David's other books. Although the book is classified TNG, it's really about Calahoun and the Excalibur crew. This is the climax of the Double Helix series (I've read all but the third and the sixth), and it seems to be the important one. Ironically, David deals with the Double Helix virus as just another super-galaxy-threatening weapon, which is kind of disapointing - one of the things I liked about the series was seeing the crew deal with a less physical threat. I wasn't impressed by the mysterious villain lurking around in the shadows until this book. You can buy this book without the rest of the Double Helix series without a problem. I also want to add that it seems David watched one too many James Bond flicks while he was writing this."
2,Not impressive whatsoever,"this was gifted to my three year old, yucky, he said, from the off-gassing smell the stain on the block gave off!its made of soft pine, no real resonant sound except in one tiny spot. Truly just not impressive or pleasant to listen to at all.get a real tone block and pass over this one, its just too cheap."
5,Aww what a beautiful album,"Truly stunning, Evermore has done a fantastic job with this release. It ranges from the well-known ""Too Late"" to the more contemplative ""This Unavoidable Thing Between Us"", to the compelling and dynamic ""Into The Ocean"". They've really covered all fields with some tracks rocking out and some inspiring thought. All in all, this album is truly beautiful and has all the potential for masterpieces in the future.Evermore has an indie rock sound with intrumentals such as violins to add dramatic quality. Despite the tracks you might have heard on tellie or the radio being ""hell awesome"" there are so many other great ones on this album, you'd be a fool not to buy it. FOOL!If you're an indie rock junkie, or you like bands such as Coldplay or Athlete. Just get it aye. Nah it's good aye."
1,save your money,this book is a joke.I am giving it one star because thats as low as I can go in the ratings
5,Extraordinarily easy-to-read must-have guide for patients,"Not a lot of jargon. The most understandable resource available for non-medical personnel interested in learning about breast cancer. The question/answer format is perfect, as it allows the reader to guide herself through the information. And Dr. Hunter does not ""dumb down"" the information.In summary, a must-buy for the newly-diagnosed patient, and a wonderful gift to any woman (with or without breast cancer)."
3,Not much you didn't already know,"Nothing you haven't already read in the fancy brochures. Not enough detail, no new insights into the engineering behind this excellent machine"
4,More like 4.5 stars...,"This stuff is great--it's very mild and soothing. A little more spice than the vanilla flavor, which is what I was looking for, but not overpowering and not overly sweet. It actually smells stronger than it tastes, which is nice because it was very aromatic. But drinking it, it's real mellow and settles well in your stomach. Ahhhh..."
2,Too old to rock... too smart to play the blues,Tull makes a mistake on this one. The music is stagnant and smells of tired Dire Straits. I am glad they have not revisited this boring blues trap. I know it is part of their past but Tull is much more than this. I was happy they returned to the prog on Roots to Branches.
3,Empire or Paul?,"This book is in two halves, only one of which I was really interested in and enjoyed. I have enjoyed some of Horsley's other books but this one, while having good material was too bogged down in the first section on Roman religious practice, mainly of interest to the academic I suspect. I was also disappointed to discover that much of the material has been published before elsewhere.Nevertheless there is some great material here that should be of value to those interested in the origins of Christianity and the work being done by the Jesus Seminar. Of particular interest to me was the point that Paul was not setting up a religion and cannot be called a Christian by today's definition."
4,Orion Sirens,"This episode is a bit of a guilty pleasure...literally. Not a lot of story or substance and it's even a bit backwards in it's ""sexism"". In a way the women remind me of the classic Sirens from ""The Odyessy"" or any Greek tale really. That whole idea has always fascinated me; women with supernatural beauty and hypnotizing sensual voices that were impossible to deny. I think the lead Orion girl (the one that has a fondness for Archer) does a pretty awesome job embodying that archetype. And I love anything Orion Syndicate; they are mentioned in almost every Star Trek, it's nice to actually see MORE of them *no pun intended*.Women will probably hate this episode, us guys can probably just mute it and still give it a 3 star. I think there's enough here to warrant at least a 4 from me, but really I don't know why I'm rating it that high. Every once and a while I just enjoy dumb stuff for my primitive man-brain. ACTION - SEX - FIGHTING - SMASH THINGS - OOH oo AH AH!!"
4,Data on Enterprise!?,"I'm excited for the rest of this mini-series within a series. Eugenics and Genome projects have always fascinated me, and I didn't realized until now how little they cover it in Star Trek. And of course it's awesome to see Brent again; Data was a HUGE part of what made TNG so great."
2,Technically Shameful,"Technically shameful:Enterprise is a worthwhile series well executed. However, the distributors of the Season 4 DVDs have included so much copy protection (especially disk 4) that they are impossible to view on a normal player. I have experienced the problem on 3 separate players. Few experiences are more frustrating than paying top dollar for DVDs and then not being able to view what you paid for."
3,Opinion reserved,"At present I am in the USA visiting my brother. I need to go back home in India , load it on my system and then i will be in a better position to write my review. So Pl give me some time for my final review to come through"
3,Tune In Next Week,"I really loved the first two seasons of this show but they lost me when it became a show that you had to watch each week to know what's going on. This works for soap operas, but is becoming a new catch trick to keep you watching, ""what's going to happen next week?"" Deparate Housewives, Carnival, Deadwood and the Soprano's are shows that do this, it's not so bad with the cable dramas because they usually have only ten or twelve episodes, and they are shown several times a week. The entire third season and much of the fourth season of Enterprise are really just one very long story line. I don't mind once in awhile a two parter, but I do have some life. I like stand alone episodes much better. I'm hooked on too many shows that carry a story arc, like Lost. I think that Enterprise could have lasted longer if it weren't for these long story arcs."
2,What MIGHT have been.,"With the year long defeat of the Xindi.......Season Four COULD have been about the birth of the federation.The ""Storm Front"" cliffhanger was the absolute worst in the Star Trek Series.T'pol and Archer Could have... married and been the 'first couple"" for the Federation.Bringing all the races together....... would have been a great season.Instead......... the series limps to the finish line, like that dehydrated guy trying to finish the ironman.....We still watch it....... and afterward, we wonder why."
3,I love it in a painful sort of way,"I wanted this series to run three more seasons. I know Enterprise had it in her. ""These Are the Voyages"" feels more like an epilogue than a stand-alone episode. However, it does wrap things up and ties it into all the other series, which is better than simply ending at ""Terra Prime,"" a decent enough episode to end on, if only because the bean counters forced us to stop having any fun. Connor Trinneer's performance in his heroic screen time feels a little off, similar to the final scene in ""Terra Prime."" I guess we all have bad days on the job, just disappointing because his performances through the rest of the series are so well done. Like all the Star Trek series finales, this one left me wishing I'd invested in facial tissue. If anything, it's just disappointing that some money guy made it end. It really is a great show, like all Star Trek serials."
1,This product damages the Wahl brand name,"My first clippers were Wahl brand and I loved them. When they finally died I tried to get a deal and switched to Oster brand. They were not nearly as good so I switched back to Wahl. This product damages their brand. I could not even get 1 complete haircut before the blades were putting 3 stripes in my hair. After 3-4 trims they were completely dull. I threw them away, shaved my head with a razor and wrote this review. Do not spend your hard earned money on this specific product."
1,worst ever tried,"It is my 3rd set clippers. I bought it in April 2009. The whole kit looks pretty cheap, from the box to the blades. The box cover did not even fix. The clipper was made with very cheap plastic and some scratch was seen. There is huge noise when turn on. Finally unable to cut in 6 months. Just pull hair. I am very good in maintaining. It must be product defect. Try to contact the manufacture: To send this back for repair will cost $11 postage. Not worth to exchange with another cheap one. This was bought on amazon."
1,WARNING!,"Two shipments received and both contained broken combs. Not only does Wahl pack these to guarantee breakage, but these combs would break in a few cuttings anyway - extremely flimsy. Wahl chose to use the cheapest plastic available (the same plastic your garbage bags are made from) and sacrificed quality in doing so.The cutter may be great, but I'll never know and I recommend that you don't risk trying to find out if it is."
2,Not so good,"The trimmer not only cuts hair, but skin as well - Be careful! the clipper is very light, in fact too light to do a good job."
4,"Great toaster, slots a little shallow","With one exception, this is a great toaster. Some of the better features are its easy portability (the back handle makes it easy to take out and put away, and the cord holder underneath keeps the cord from going everywhere).I especially like the bagel feature, which turns off the outside heaters, allowing the inside of the bagel to get toaster.The one problem is that the slots are a little shallow, and you can't toast a whole piece of rye bread without about an inch of the bread sticking out and not getting toasted.Update: About 14 months after buying this, it died. No warranty, so out it went. Replaced it with a Krups (ASIN: B0001I9RA0)"
1,Burned me and then broke,"I loved the looks of this toaster, and the pop-out feature so my preschoolers could make their own waffles. Not only did the product not work well, but it's dangerous as well.Although it is advertised as ""staying cool"", the chrome areas where the toast is inserted get quite hot. I was reaching over to get something behind the toaster, and my arm brushed against the hot chrome. Over a month later, I still have a large burn scar. With the forward-facing design, this is actually quite easy to do, and my 4 year old also has a small burn on his arm.In addition, the unit itself was very cheaply made, and it often took several tries for the unit to grab the toast and start toasting. Finally, after about 6 months, it got stuck, and we couldn't get it to work again. Into the garbage and good riddance!"
2,Toasting problem,"Several months ago, I purchased a T-Fal toaster. The toaster has some great features and I want to give it at least a 4 or 5-star rating but the toaster toasts only on one side of the bread most of the time. Interestingly, every now and then, it toasts both sides of the bread. Can you help me? I sent an E-mail to T-fal about this problem but never received a response and have been unable to contact you by phone. I called 800-395-8325, wait and wait and wait and, on several occasions before anyone gets to the phone, I'm cut off, thus this E-mail. HELP! I'd like to give one of these toasters as a Christmas gift but first need to know if this ""one-side"" toasting is a problem of this toaster or, if I just happened to have one that does not function as it should. Thank you for your attention to my request and a prompt response."
1,ALERT !!!!!!!,Stay away from it! Keep your family and house safe!!!!!!!!!Our toaster started fire in the kitchen within a few seconds while it was on the lowest setting (1).We've had it for five months.
1,Consumer Reports is wrong! terrible toaster!,"We purchased this toaster a little over a month ago based on Consumer Reports rating this a great toaster. I do not know what toaster they tested, however it could not have been this one. Since getting the toaster it has consistantly demonstrated that it can burn toast and bagles at any setting. The worst feature is that you can burn something at setting 3 and lower it to 2 and it still burns or does not hardly even toast. The other poor design on the toaster is that it is very shallow. Any bread that is not of standard Wonder Bread size either is not toasted on the top or if it is a longer slice of bread will not fit at all. I almost feel bad taking this piece of junk to a charity donation drop off."
1,no product,"I ordered in January, never received, supposedly ups left on doorstep. I""ve never had anything taken before. I emailed them, no response, I filed a claim and still hasn't been solved."
3,Built for giants,"The pants are well constructed, but built for giants. My husband is 5' 11"", we bought a size #7. I kid you not I had to remove 6"" and re-hem. Luckily, I am a seamstress, so no big deal, but if you are not crafty, you may need to reconsider these unless you are 6'5""."
3,Good For Kids,"I'm a fan of this artist, but I prefer the works of his that are more on the side of Creature Tech. This book entertaining, but is probably more of a kids thing than for me. There are good messages in here, and it doesnt hold talk down to kids, which always makes the best childrens entertainment."
4,"Fantastic Read, Fantastic Purchase",A Story that is 'The Iron Giant' meets 'Old Yeller' with Dinosaurs?!?!? How much more awesome can a graphic novel get? An excellent read that will give you a dinosaur of an appetite as you finish each page. The worst part of this book is when the pages become extinct....er...I mean...when you have reached the last page. I have already read it multiple times with roars of approval. Go Tommysaurus!!!!!
2,Not what I was looking for.,"No disrespect to the author, but the DVD wasn't what my wife and I were looking for. Thought it would feature a lady massaging a guy but was of 2 guys massaging each other."
4,wicker fan,I like the fan the top was hard to install but with a little time everything came together. The breeze is great overall I like the product and I would recommend it. It's beautiful on my ceiling. The color is great exactly as pictured.
5,Good Ipod Case,"I have another Ipod case (Agent35) along with this one. This one is strong, sturdy and works well with my 60Gb ipod.Pros:- cool relfective case that makes your friends very jealous.- strong and sturdy- comes with two cases for proper fit of your specific ipod (fits very well).- has not scratched yet, though I haven't tried specifically to scratch it.- Added bonus: I like the backing of the case (black) because of the feel and it looks hard to scratchCons:- very minor, but has a small vertical line below the play button where it was joined during the manufacturing process. One must look closely to spot it.IMHO it is the best one I have owned so far."
1,Scratched Merchandise and No C.S.,"This product arrived scratche and the customer service would do nothing about a replacement. They have ignorged emails and phone calls and refuse to a) take the product back for a refund, or b) replace the product with a non-defective case. I would not recommend getting one of these cases and definately not through antonline.com"
2,ipod chrome case,"The case comes with two back covers for the different thickness 5th generation Ipods (30,60,80Gb). The case is very sleek looking; however video becomes very dark to watch through the chrome. The menu screens are still easy to view through the chrome. The chrome plastic cover does seem to be easily scratched."
1,AWFUL techno-thriller wannabe!,"Attempting to pull myself through this supposed piece of fiction was like sitting in a classroom with a million chalkboards, and Edward Scissorhands raking over all of them at once, from beginning to end of the literary un-sensation.The story was difficult to follow, plain and simple.The characters were cardboard, plain and simple.Yes, this is a work of fiction, but the author put no substance in his words. The author used plain-speak vanilla to describe almost all of the events, with the few exceptions of going on and on about the technology about a pilotless plain, though the technology wasn't all that impressive either which was described.This book was as bad as the movie just released called 'STEALTH'. Don't waste your money, even on a used book."
3,All good except the car power adapter.,The care power adapter doesn't stay in the cig lighter very well. So a jiggle and the cord comes out of the socket and the player looses power. If it looses power it looses its place in the book and then you have to spend time getting back to the spot. Frustrating. Should have battery back up.
1,NOT AN MP3 or ATRAC PLAYER,"As the other reviewer said, this a very old standard model of cd player. I doesnt even read mp3 although it says so in the product description but just watch the picture, it doesn't have the atrac cd anywhere. I bought it and I opened the box so it was to late for me and now I can't change it. DOn't make the same mistake."
4,A great read,"I loved this book. I have always loved coming-of-age, first-person narratives, and this one is one of the best I've read. I saved it in my favorites on my Kindle to read again someday."
5,Mmmmmhhhmmm,This stuff smells SO good. I was walking ehind a lady and told her she smelled good and she showed me a big bottle of it. I researched it & found it runs about 600 bucks. WO! So I opt for the travel size for now.
5,Outstanding book!,"I am not a math or science wizard, but study both for recreation and fun. I did not have good maths profs in college and if I had had this book I would have been more successful. It reads easily and the math is presented extremely well and is very understandable. The author interweaves many snippets of personal and historical information and thus the book becomes a marriage of math and history in the best way possible. I have taken this book out many times to read and reread chapters. Yes, it's one of those. Buy it. No matter what your interests or educational level this will be one of those books you keep close and know where it is all the time."
4,its a preaty dang good game,"i only played this game for an hour and a half but i got all the way to the third world. however i am a fanatic about this sort of game so in a way i am suprised that i didnt get further. the wepons are very good, i was very impressed by the dual vipers. most of the time i dont like gladiator sort of games but this one was made so superbly well u have to be insane not to like it. the two bots that u get, ""Sarge"" and ""Green"" if i remember corectly, are absolutly hilarios. sarge is the traditional sargent, hard core and straight to the point. green is just like a new recrute, he still has nightmares about what happened to there last owner. i will stop telling u the plotline now so that u an go out and get it for ur self and figure it out. its a great game, have fun dying."
4,BEST RACHET GAME YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When i first got this game i wasin't sure if it was going to be good or not because it had no storyline.They were wrong !!! Its the best Rachet and Clank game yet but i advise you to try out the other Rachet and Clank games too. This game has some curses no blood and alot of shooting. HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Fun, but straying","This game rocks, but it does stray away from the original gameplay. The guns are the best though, and the game looks cool in the first-person view, and makes it more challenging. I have beaten this game over 20 times now, but I still find it hard to be in FPS view and on hardest mode. This way even the weakest enemy can get you from behind or the sides, as you cannot see there. This mode makes it funner for the ones who have been complaining."
2,Not Worth Buying,"I was sadly disappointed in the game, and as a huge R&C fan, I still bought it. One of my favorite parts about the other games was exploring the different worlds and the adventure themes. In this one, all you get is the endless arena battles. I feel like the game lost its element of excitement and adventure. The new guns were interesting and I especially liked the napalm mod, but the music and limited space are very annoying. Also, the controls are altered, which really confused me at the start. The humor has changed into more of an adult type. I used to let my little sister watch the other R&C's, but I am nervous about having her taking in all the language and ruthlessness of this one. Once you get used to the new controls, the boring music, the blatant humor, and the monotonous arena battles, I guess the game is okay. Still better than the other games out there, but I expected better quality from Ratchet."
3,Witty,"The start of the book was great, funny & witty, the end became a big of a drag. Worth the read"
3,Not as New-Looking as Expected,"I bought this book new, but it was a little beat-up (mainly the front flap). I was just expecting a product that didn't appear worn at all."
5,The Best Of Dilbert! (and Dogbert and Ratbert&#65533;),"This Book is superbly great. Scott Adams sends double time, since the text is also very funny. About half text and half strips, this book will really make you laugh! If you are down on work, (or just hate it!), READ THIS BOOK"
2,Slow reading,Very hard to get into. Lots of names and kinda hard to keep up. Whos who other than the family that its based on. Not a bad book just so as long as you read True story b4 or after it so u understand this book better. Overall put togther okat...
4,The Platinum King,"I just finished reading The Platinum King, and thoroughly enjoyed the book. The majority of this book was read on trips to and from Anchorage, Alaska which added special meaning and a sense of connection with Andrew Olson. I will always remember the hardships and difficulties Andrew encountered traveling and the amount of time required for trips we take for granted today. It certainly is interesting to watch people complaining because their plane is an hour late!The book is well written, engaging, and shows the thought, effort and love put forth to tell the story of Andrew Olson. The history of this time period in Alaska and in particular the mining industry was thoughtfully woven into the entire fabric of this mans' life, his trials, tribulations and success.I wholeheartedly recommend this book not only for the historical value, but also for the pure enjoyment of reading."
1,Be sure you want ECC,"This product did not work with my Dell desktop. Dell specifies that non-ECC memory should be used. There was nothing in the product description to indicate that this was ECC. When I went to a local store to buy a replacement, the clerk looked at the Amazon invoice and noted ECC as part of product number. Amazon should change their description to make it clear that the memory has ECC."
4,Good,The seller of this Item was great and Barlow girl was good. we enjoyed it somewhat and now it sit on the rack with all the others.
5,BarlowGirl- How Can We Be Silent,I was very pleased when I recieved this cd. I love BarlowGirl and the seller was honest about the description. It was shrink wrapped and not damaged at all!!
5,How can we be silent,The girls did an awesome job with this cd.My 11yr old daughter loves it!Definately alot of head shaking and dancing going on in my home! This is a way in which they have to chosen to sing about what they believe in.
2,If only they had packed it properly!!!,"I purchased the sunflower yellow 4 piece place setting twice.The first time everything was fine. The second time, the plate was broken in two, and the cup was badly nicked on the bottom, I ended up throwing it away.The packaging was dreadful, someone never heard of bubble wrap! or even stuffed paper. The plate which had broken had been shoved into a narrow slot.I would be happy to purchase more if they would come up with a solution to this"
5,Great sturdy set,"This set is fantastic! The weight is perfect so it doesn't feel like they are going to break easily, but not heavy enough where they are too heavy to carry multiple in your hand. They wash well and stack well. I ordered multiple colors and they all come exactly how they are pictured. The only drawback is the white set does show marks from cutting on them. (my son is a little rough when cutting meat), but this did not happen with any other colors, so I didn't lower the rating."
5,Great Stoneware,"I love my Fiestaware. I've seen it for years, but always thought of it as something from the 1950s that was too dated for my taste. But when I needed good solid stoneware to replace my old dishes, I kept coming back to Fiestaware. The stoneware is good quality, the dimensions of the dishes are generous, and the color is excellent. I have a sunflower theme in my farmhouse kitchen, and the sunflower Fiestaware pulls it all together. Working with Amazon to make the purchase was great. Shipping was quick and nothing was damaged. The price for the set was far below that of my local department stores. I recommend the purchase of Fiestaware from Amazon."
3,Fiesta Dinnerware Not Cadmium Free,"I called the company that makes Fiesta. I was told that cadmium was used in the glaze, but only 0.02%. The customer service person who answered my questions checked with someone while I was on hold. Although they say they are lead-free, again, it was at 0.02% and, being so low, the representative said that it allows them to put 100% lead-free on their boxes. Some Internet sites said one should not store acidic foods in Fiesta dinnerware and to wash them by hand because very hot dishwasher temperatures could produce leaching. What can one believe anymore? If the Internet sites are incorrect, then I would give a higher rating to Fiesta."
2,"fiesta 4-piece place setting, sunflower","The mug is defective. It has a little sharp tag on the inside handle. How can I exchange it, please?"
