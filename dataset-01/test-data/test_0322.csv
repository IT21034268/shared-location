2,dry bars- don't waste your money!,"These peanut butter pleaser bars were very dry, and proabably some of the least favorite bars our family has ever tried."
2,They must have changed the video - too easy,"I read [another] review and anxiously awaited my order. When it came, it contained only TWO workouts: First, a 6 minute warmup, almost too slow to even follow (est. 24-26 spm). Then, came a 22 minute ""pyramid"" row, with a minute of very slow (like above), then a short burst of 10 strokes at maybe 28-29. After another minute of ""paddling"", they rowed 20 strokes at 28-29,etc up to 50 strokes, then back down to 10. Finally came 20 strokes at 30-31. Fine for a beginner, but MUCH too easy for even a good intermediate."
1,Don't waste your money on this item,"I had already two of these, both exhibited problems immediately or within a few weeks. The warranty sucks: If you are lucky enough that it breaks within the short 90 day warranty period then you still have to send it in to Coby and pre-pay shipping for both ways. We watched a movie yesterday and the picture started freezing up half-way through the movie. We have not been able to watch an entire movie yet with either of the two Coby DVD-527's we had.I bought it because the specs looked great, plays international movies (PAL and SECAM), 110 and 220V compatible etc. But for twenty dollars more you will get a DVD player that has all of this and actually works."
4,"I know it's only TSMR, but I LIKE IT.","I had avoided this album for years; exactly why escapes me (possibly all the negative hype). After having worn out ""Beggars"" and ""Exile"", I recently began exploring other Stones albums, including this one. What a pleasant shock! The album is actually quite solid, with enjoyable lesser-known songs that you'll never hear on the radio.The cover is too obvious to be anything other than a probable ""tip of the hat"" to their rivals. One source states that the Beatles' images are visible somewhere in it, though I can't confirm that. Other obivious ""tips"" to the Sergeant include recordings of conversations infused in the music on some tracks. The fifth track is the only real weakness here. It is at best an overly-long free-form jazzy experiment with random noise. It's interesting in that it predates Lennon's ""Revolution 9"" by several months.Give this record a try. It's truly a neglected Stones album. Get the Russian CD MAXIMUM bonus tracks edition if you can find it."
4,BETTER THAN SERGEANT PEPPER!!!,"I first listened to this album when I was fifteen and I must say that this album is NOT a Sergeant Pepper rip off. I dont know if it was meant to be or not but it isnt at all like it. I hated Sergeant Pepper but I loved this album. While S.P. was kind of cutsy and dumb, this album is very beautiful,wistful, and surreal. It uses fantasy and wonder to create a dark and lovely atmosphere. This music is defiantly more mature and thought provoking than the Beatles could ever be.There are some very romantic and fascinating songs on this album while the songs on S.P. arent even very interesting. This is a really great album and I will scream if i hear one more person compare it to Sergeant Pepper. For gods sake, even the cover of Their Satanic Majesties is more imaginative and interesting than Sergeant Peppers silly cover."
4,A Little Know Classic,"Not one of the Rolling Stone's most well know albums, but it is a real gem! The bad boys of 60's rock version of a Magical Mystery Tour!"
2,Stones Only Weak Album in 35 Years,"It just goes to show that you should always be yourself. The one time they try to copy another band-The Beatles-they fail miserably (to be fare, Beatles can't do what the Stones do either.) But even with their weakest effort, they came away with two classics I never get tired of; ""2,000 Light Years"" and ""She's a Rainbow."" These songs alone still make it worth purchasing, smoking & drinking to."
4,Request Granted! A Charming Slice Of Poppy Psychedelia,"Most Rolling Stones fans consider this 1967 psychedelic experiment to be an abomination, a blemish on an otherwise respectable string of sixties albums. [....] True, ""Sing This All Together"" is a bit monotonous and doesn't really go anywhere, but ""Citadel"" is solid with a great Richards riff and ""2000 Light Years From Home"" is as good as anything from Pink Floyd during this period. ""She's A Rainbow"" was the single and is alot of fun to listen to all these years later. The album is far from awful, and yet not really a masterpiece either. Just accept it for what it is and take it in it's proper [...] context. Dig it, man!"
2,Not something you will frequently take out of the shelf...,"I have tried to like this album, but it is a hard thing to achieve. If it depended on the first song, as an aperitive, you would take this out of the player right out. An obvious (and miserable) copy of the Beatles, with just a couple of good songs, everyone knows which ones, so better buy them in mp3 format and save some money. Full of cheesy effects (snoring, WTH??) If you don't think it is, watch almost every video of the Beatles while on travel, and you will surely watch Mick Jagger, mingling around them to see what pieces of their creativity would drip unto him, LOL...I heard it today, and the last time I heard it was more than a year ago...so maybe in a couple of years I will give it a try. A star for each good song in this mess."
2,The Album Cover is the Highlight,"So unless you're Picasso or one of Mick's illegitimate children, avoid this one. Hard to believe this is the same band who created Exile, Sticky, Beggars, and Bleed."
1,Not Recommended,"I bought my first Stones album in 1977, at the age of 13, and I've been a loyal fan every since. I tend to avoid Greatest Hits collections in favor of original albums as conceived by the artists.In this case, I strongly advocate an exception to the rule. Unless you are an obsessive with a need to own every Rolling Stones release, I urge that you stay away from this one. It consists mostly of unlistenable pseudo-psychaedelic nonsense that you will never want to listen to again . . . if you make it through a first listening.One song stands out, ""she's a rainbow"" - a great track. But if you need to own this song, buy Hot Rocks II. In this case, I'd prefer to have a mediocre Greatest Hits album in my collection than to have Satanic Majesties stinking the place up."
2,Sgt Peppers Satanic Majesties Band,"The Rolling Rip-offs! After reading a review of someone here stating this album is as good or better than Sgt Pepper, I just had to laugh. This album is as good as Pink Floyds debut (Pipers at the Gates)from this same year, but certainly not Pepper. . The song In Another Land tries to capture the atmosphere of John's Lucy in teh Sky. It's really pretty pathetic. This album does have two decent tracks. She's a Rainbow and 2000 Light Years From Home.It is well known that Mick used to come to the Beatles sessions and John had to ask him to stop showing up all time. Trying to steal ideas no doubt. The production is pretty bad as well. All in all, the Beatles are better than the Stones. Sgt Pepper will forever be ""THE"" album of all-time."
2,Stoned Psychedelia,"All in all, ""Their Satanic Majesties Request"" isn't a bad album. However, it's not in the same league as ""Let It Bleed,"" ""Begger's Banquet"" or even ""Aftermath."" Still, this album does have artistic merit to it and it's definitely worth adding to your collection."
4,Great Product - Misleading Information,"This work from the Rolling Stones is one that rank pretty high with the other top releases, It does kind of remind me of Sgt. Peppers a little in concept. It has DSD stamped all over it, only to find that it is just a redbook cd, I was under the impression it was a DSD release with the extra fidelity that DSD offers. No Dice."
5,great movie,i watch the first one and then this one and i like the second one alot better the cast and crew really came to life in this film and i enjoyed i think everybody that likes animal movies should get this film.
1,This is Great?,"Oh My GOD!This is the Greatest work yet form Roy Williams.He has out done himself.Spell Binding, could NOT put it down.Pure freaking genius!You have to be a fool to not buy this book!Finally, The Great American Novel!Just kidding...it sucks!In Fact it sucks Big Time!"
4,Jesse Stone: Thin Ice,"Being a fan of both Parker and Selleck, I found this movie to be well made and in keeping with the general quality of the series."
4,"GREAT, BUT WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE MORE","I bought this book wanting to know more about the making of the movie, but didn't get as much as I'd hoped for. It does include many sketches from Tim Burton, but hardly an from others who worked on the film. Yes, it does include lyrics to the songs featured in the film, all except for the one I was hoping for ( I can't remember the name, but it's the last song in the movie sung by Jack & Sally... ""if you don't mind, I'd like to join you by your side, Where we can gaze upon the stars, And sit together, Now and Forever.."")Most of the book is a pictoral reference on the movie, and though I certainly would have loved to see more, it was still a good buy. It's just too bad I didn't get to read anything on the making of the film, or Burton's thoughts on its production."
5,Awesome album-a must add to your music library,"This has got to be one of my all time favorite albums, the lyrics, the diversity in the music, their uniqueness. Have also caught these guys live, would highly recommend as well. Like no other band out there!!!"
5,Everyman's Story,Garrison has a way of seeing life as it is and still giving it a humorous slant. I love his writings and I loved this book.
2,A lot of filler,"I expected a nice Wobegon-type read, but adapted when I realized it wasn't. But as much as I tried, I couldn't learn to like the book. It had its moments, but seemed to be more and more filler (Mr. Blue, GOP bashing, bad poems, philisophical ramblings, etc), along with just too much gratuitous sex. Basically it was just a thin plot with lots of padding to make it seem worth the $$. Lucking I got this from a book lending shelf, so all I wasted was my time. I wonder if Keillor had the Pederson syndrome himself when he wrote this (from the last chapter). It would certainly explain things."
2,He had me for the first 120 pages...,"...and then things came crashing down. Too much ""Dear Blue."" Too much self-absorption. Too much melancholy."
2,Stick to Lake Woebegone,"This was like ""Lake Wobegone meets New York City."" It just did not work for me. The characters were pretty one-dimensional and the scenes at the New Yorker just plain silly in a tedious way. (Normally for me, silly is a big plus.) The best parts of the book were the letters to Mr. Blue.I was disappointed."
2,Democratic Propaganda,Keillor should consider using his talent and energy running for office or trying to change all that he gripes about rather than spending most of his time taking potshots-for-profit at Republicans.
4,Pop from the 60's. Whoopie!,"A very pleasent album from 1967 which makes it fun to imagine the mood, and groove at that time. Party on !"
2,Possible P.O.S.,"I literally just bought this thing for a flight home from Chicago a couple days ago, fully charged. I watched it for about 2 hours when the battery died. Then I plugged it into a TV at home, got about halfway through a brand new movie (no scrathes), and it started skipping. I basically had to skip the whole chapter just to finish the movie. I also noticed that the motor in it is quite loud when the airplane noise doesn't block it out (at home), good thing you mostly use these portables with headphones. I'd say go with a more established electronics brand that's known for it's quality."
1,Failed after five months,"Product looked great pre-purchase, and worked fine for the initial warranty period. After reading all the positive online reviews for the player, and disregarding the reports of the products failure I decided to buy it. After about five months (with very little usage, and no abuse whatsoever) I got the fatal ""no disk"" error. My key learnings on this product can be summarised as follows:1) It worked great while it lasted.2) Don't trust a no-name product with a 90 day warranty.3) You get what you pay for.4) I will never buy another Coby product, ever."
2,It was cool while it lasted.,"I'm not sure how long I had it before I got the ""no disc"" message but I know it was well beyond the warranty period. Still it was a dissapointmet when it happened. No one buys anything, (even something cheap) expecting it to only last till the warranty ends!Me and my kids loved this player while it lasted. It seemed perfect for our needs and what a price! And I have to say that we got a lot of use out of it before it stopped on us. But the fact of the matter is that it did stop just like all the others appear to have, suddenly saying no disc. Bummer!"
1,Piece of Junk,Seems like a nice product until the skipping gets so bad that the movie is unwatchable. Got progressively worse over the week that I owned it.
2,Cony dvd player stopped working....,"It won't play dvd's. I can still use the input feature, which is nice for hooking up a game console, and now, a seperate dvd player. I pretty much just use this as a screen now, which is annoying. I paid hard earned money for this. I wanted to be able to use it while traveling. ha not now. amazon shouldn't sell cheap stuff. I want my money back!!"
3,Recommended to buy.....,I bought this portable DVD player and connected to home theater...wow..its excellent and audio is awesome...
2,could be worst,"If I were to use this product as a DVD player I would be highly disappointed; I am using it as a monitor for my A/V Theater.If you attemp to play DVDs, most of them either won't play or they scip or get stuck on a sceen. The sound is very low so you must use head phones or plug the unit into amplified speakers.Other than this, the Picture quality is beautiful."
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE,"Nothing by Coby has been impressive to me, and the portable DVD player is the worst of their execrable products. Mine lasted about two weeks, and ruined several disks before giving up the ghost. I have since switched to other brand names--ANY other brand names--and have not been let down."
1,dead!!,i bought it for my niece in Oct 2005. it seemed like an excellent portable player at that time...but 2 months and it is dead. it doesnt turn on no matter what. i called the Coby customer service and the rep told me that he would replace the unit since it has a 90-day warranty but i will have to pay both way shipping which would be almost 20 bucks!
1,Failed After a Few Months,"Worked great for a few months, then failed to work again. Gives you a no disk error."
2,Sort of a basement/garage recording,"This is the first album recordered before ""Back to Black"" but released afterward in the US. There was a reason. Some (that's some, not all)very weak orchestrations with percussion (bamboo sticks?) right out of my son's pre-school band. Suggest sampling and downloading tracks. BIG fans will like this CD, but it is a prequel to the more pop ""Black""."
5,Vastly superior to Back to Black,"This album is much better than the (awesome) Back to Black. In other words, it's one of the best albums I've ever heard. I had to listen to it twice in a row the first time."
5,Great Artist and Song Stylist,"If she lives long enough and keeps developing her craft, Amy will rank among the great female vocalists of all time: Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, Ella Fitzgerald, etc. On this album she manages to rise above some horrendous arrangements and tedious percussion (is it human or machine-made?) on ""Round Midnight"" and ""Moody's Mood for Love"" and others. Some of the newer material is outstanding and is brilliantly executed: ""I Heard Love Is Blind"" and ""F*** Me Pumps"" come to mind. Curiously, the lengthy title song is my least favorite on the album, but I don't care: There are so many others to enjoy and savor. I wish she would take better care of herself. It is as if she is slowly committing suicide before our eyes...and no one seems able to stop her."
5,GOD I LOVE AMY!!!,I love this CD and the additional cd is really something! Her live performance is unbelievable.
5,Bring her to the States!,"I was listening to a public radio station and heard her version of 'Moody's Mood for Love' and bought the CD on that song alone. I rarely purchase a CD one just one song. I was rewarded with a refreshingly different ""R&B;"" CD. She has a style and sound all her own but you can hear her obvious influences from the likes of Ella Fitzgearld and Sarah Vaughn. She sometimes sounds like Lauryn Hill.Perceptive songs about relationships and the things around her make for a timeless CD. It's even more remarkable because she was only 19 when this was released!I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new artist to follow where you can't wait for them to release new material. I know I am!"
4,An easier pace for a Nick Stone novel,"The Nick Stone series si full great page-turning material - usually some pretty tense situations thrown in. This one is a little different because Nick does not find himself in quite so many tight spots. I found it a gripping read, nevertheless."
5,Fun!,My daughter and her husband raise beef cattle so she is always looking for some fun cow items - another cute winner.
4,In response,"I think that an ape playing an electric keyboard in a steel works factory amongst all the machinery might sound pretty far out, actually."
2,Electro-gurgles,"2 1/2A bloated blob of asymmetrical electronic buzz, Autechre's least reliable disc marked, perhaps too significantly, the duo's radical departure from relative cohesion into more abstract mathematical sounds. Unfortunately, the problem with Confield is the fact that this release seeks only to underscore this blossoming, introspective beat-making without offering anything to hang its discombobulated head around. The result, (unlike ""Pen Expers "" which I feel is the only track truly integrated well into this new methodology) remains a dragging, pretentious bore, not without its moments of radiant, metallic, deviant leakage mind you, but a bore nonetheless."
1,oh dear lord....,"It's like an insane orangutang let loose with a blender in a grocery store. Sure he can make you a smoothie that reminds you of something relatively tasty from time to time, but he'll mostly make you something pretty damn awful."
4,Bulky Autechre,"Autechre's 6th album is surely one of their most difficult and ambitious records so far.More minimalistic than ever with lots of soul and depth, these tracks remain, in my humble opinion, the some of the very best in their whole career (I would also go so far, that Autechre seems to me the only Warp project from early that continues to be innovating while all the others just seems to stangnate or dissapoint (see ""Nightmares on Wax"".So go check out ""Sim Gishel"" (it goes deeeep !) and ""Eidetic Casein"" to get a first glimpse, or just make a beeline into a record store of you choice and buy the best over-the-counter drug you can get all year. It's called ""Confield"" !"
3,Not Bad but Not Great Either,"I had high hopes for this simple book since I am totally a visual learner. The pictures and colors greatly appealed to me, and they are indeed very nice.That being said, I felt like the organization of the book was lacking; too many concepts were explained out of order or in such a way that a smooth flow didn't occur. Also, knowledge was assumed on the part of the reader in a manner that I found unacceptable. It was like, ""Jeese, I'm reading this kind of book to find out WHAT such and such is, not just to read ABOUT it."" Kind of like being told lots of details about a 401(k) without ever being told what it really is.Overall: Helpful as a supplement to another book, such as _Retirement Bible_, by Lynn O'Shaughnessy. Good for reinforcing your learning."
5,"Excellent book, great everyday tools for those with anxiety","This is an excellent book, it came highly recommended (nearly demanded) by my therapist. A licensed clinical psychologist. I love this book. It is empowering for the individual reading it and gives you very reasonable, do-able exercises to help replace your anxieties with confidence. I would highly recommend this book to anyone suffering from anxiety and low self-esteem. YOU'RE WORTH IT!! BUY THE BOOK!!"
2,Carey's black glitters showered...,"This was Carey's first album under Virgin Records. The first track ""Loverboy"" was a mixture of a classic Cameo and a screeching Carey. ""Lead The Way"" and ""Never Too Far"" are the only tunes that can be considered quality songs so there I gave 2 stars, and the rest of the songs are all pretentious hip hop ditties set to dismay local and international fans. As a fact, it has been a flop and then there came the film with the same title and was stamped ""negative"" by almost every critic in the US and worldwide. This record is OK but not FINE for my taste. Go get Tina Arena's albums instead!"
3,Glittering lights..overshadowed..,This album is just so-soSome good songs seems the be overshadowed by its negative publicity and the movie(We all know the movie Flop badly)yet Never too Far and Lead The Way are great songs...3 out of 5 stars
3,Well it did have a few good songs...,"I would have to say that this is not one of Mariah Carey's best cd's. Even though the cd has some good music on it, I would have been better off borrowing it from someone then buying it myself.If you're looking for a great cd check out Mariah Carey's greatest hits."
5,"love it, but wish there was more songs","I love Mariah's glitter, but only wish there were more songs on here and my only other complaint is on the song ""Last Night A DJ Saved My Life,"" there's too much guest rappers on the song and not enough Mariah, she is suppose to be the main focus not her fellow rappers. Best songs on here are ""Lead The Way,"" ""Never Too Far,"" ""Twister,"" and ""If We"" feat. Ja Rule and Nate Dogg. The songs on Glitter are mostly fun uptempo tracks and are good to party/dance to. ""Loverboy"" has got to be the funnest song on this CD."
5,Mariah 'Glitters',"""Glitter"" is truly one of Mariah's prime recordings. If this just wasn't attached to the movie which was condemed even before it opened, it would have been Mariah's bestselling. ""Loverboy"" is the weirdest track, and Mariah sounds like she had a cold when she sang it. Rappers spoil this track. ""Lead The Way"" is the second best track on the CD, and has Mariah hitting one of her trademark high notes, one of only about 3 on the CD. ""I Didn't Mean to Turn You On"" is an OK song, but not a classic Mariah remake. ""Never Too Far"" is the best song on the CD, and an amazing listen. ""Twister"", is a sad song about her hairdresser who committed suicide. Bottom line: A good CD, if you skip all the tracks with rappers on them."
1,Her 15 Minutes Expired Hours Ago!,"Two versions of Loverboy (the dreadful embarrassment of a single) on the album reveal a performer who has clearly run out of fresh ideas and must result to the ever-present rapper guest stars to increase sales. I suggest that anyone considering buying this album should purchase the latest from Mary J. Blige instead. It is a much better effort from a real talent. Mariah's album on the other hand smacks of desperation.The movie and album are both stinkers. Bland ballads, [unsuccesful] r&b attempts (with... rappers rapping over the vocals)... remakes of old songs that are better left forgotten, and tacky artwork is enough to make your stomach turn! Soon to be at a used cd shop near you..."
1,glitter ruined everything,virgin invested money in this crap so much that they didn't have enough left to continue promoting janet jackson's all for you album which still had promising hits yet to be heard like trust a try and come on get up. Maybe they were afraid she would have more number ones than mariah. Thanks a lot mariah!
1,Trully Dissapointment,"I used to be Mariah's #1 fan. All I can say is, she was the best female vocalist I've ever heard, until the Butterfly album. Her voice changed a lot. About Glitter, this is the worst af all Mariah's albums. She should make a duet with other talented artists like Alicia Keys, Brian McKnight, or Christina Aguilera instead of colaborating with all trashy rappers in the USA. ...."
1,OKAY!.....THAT'S IT!.....I'VE HAD ENOUGH!!!!!!,"i'm never buying another mariah carey album again! this mindless dribble makes me wanna puke. this album totally stinks. her movie isn't much better. i think mariah is a talented singer, but for some reason starting with the album butterfly, every album she has released has been (...)."
1,This CD is no good....,"Let me tell you, I love Mariah Carey and have almost all of her albums, but this album .... First, all the songs sound like her last album and she does the same melodies, riffs, etc. I know they say ""if it works, don't change it"" but she really needs to. Mariah needs to stop producing the songs herself and find some great people to do that for her. Again, in my opinion, this CD sucks so back that when I first bought it and listened to it, I decided I should give it to my daughter instead. Don't waste your money."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"As a big fan of Mariah Carey's, I was anticipating the release of ""Glitter,"" but I wasn't 100% pleased with it. First of all, nearly all of the material on the album is hip-hop and doesn't showcase Mariah's amazing voice.Although, there were some good songs on the album, like ""Never Too Far,"" ""Lead the Way,"" ""Loverboy,"" ""Didn't Mean To Turn You On"" and ""All My Life.""I recommend this album to anybody who enjoys R&B; and/or hip-hop music, but if you're a fan of Mariah's previous work, you probably will not enjoy ""Glitter"" that much."
4,Suprisingly... not that bad,"I am a huge music fan and I always like to keep on top of the latest releases. I was excited when I heard Mariah Carey had a new album coming out, even though I am not a huge fan, I do have many of her previous CD's and enjoy her music. This CD came out to mixed reviews, and many people are hesitant whether or not to buy it. Although it's not a must have, it is an enjoyable album throughout. Ballads like ""Never Too Far"" and ""Reflections"" are beautiful, but there are still your typical hiphop party jams like ""Loverboy"" and ""Last Night A DJ Saved My Life"". Its got all aspects of the r&b and hiphop music scene covered. ..."
5,"She Does it Again, Will She Ever Stop??","I am sitting here listening to yet another great CD, most of which was also partly written and produced by this amazing singer. This CD is very similar to all CDs she has released in the past. Her style is amazing as always.It really disturbs me that this album could receive any bad reviews from the media. I am also confused that people claim she has changed her style or that she is trying to become someone else. I own every CD she has put out and they all follow a very similar format and style. I still think she is the absolute best and will continue to do so.If you love Mariah, you do not want to miss this one. Please, go out and buy the album, show her your continued support!"
3,"""Glitter "" -- Dims","I recieved this soundtrack as a gift. I like Mariah Carey, but I find this CD does not have the shine to withstand the test of time.The CD could do without the rap music element. Mariah seems out of palce singing pop music in the middle of a rap beat. An example of this, is track eight ""Last Night, a DJ Saved My Life."" Don't get me wrong it is a good track but Mariah is lost in the middle somewhere. I don't understand it. I also found I could have done without the ""Loverboy"" rap remix.On the other hand, there are some nice tunes on this CD as well.Loverboy (track 12)Didn't Mean to Turn You On (track 4)All My Life (track 6)There are Twelve total tracks. I can do without half of them. It is not her worst; not her best. It's somewhere in between.I have not seen the movie."
2,"Well, not too good","I have been a faithful supporter of Mariah's since 1990. I have loved MOST of her songs (I wasn't too crazy about ""One Sweet Day"") and always took her side in the ""Whitney vs. Mariah"" arguments with my cousin, who is a huge Whitney fan. But this album is awful. Horrendous, in fact.Loverboy (Remix)- annoying. Worst lyrics ever. Trashy.Lead the Way- the album's saving grace. Beautiful ballad.If We- Mariah whispers and I have no idea what she is saying.Didn't Mean- bad '80s remake. Not suited for Mariah.Funkin' 4 Jamaica- I refuse to comment on this ""song""All my Life- another saving grace. Mariah rocks out a little.Reflections- good lyrics, but hopelessly boring.DJ Saving My Life- not bad, actually. Too many rappers.Want You- I always skip this.Never Too Far- best song on the album.Twister- extremely dull.Mariah, I'm disappointed."
3,MARIAH DOES BETTER,"I heard this CD in Record Store and bought. But Mariah can get better than this. I like two ballads and the remake Last Night DJ Save my life. It's not the same Mariah from the 3 firsts albums. It was missing the emotional tracks like Hero,Vision of love, I don't wanna cry, etc.I like it but not so much!"
2,"Oh, poo, Mariah!","Remember Mariah's self-titled debut? Remember ""Emotions"" or ""Dreamlover""? Remember ""Fantasy"" and ""Butterfly""? Yes, all of those were wonderful, now do you remember the angst that you felt the first time you heard the entire ""Heartbreaker"" album? Well ""Glitter"" is as bad as that times 5! The only songs I think are worth anything is the beautiful yet a tad bit overdramatic (like the movie, ""Glitter""), ""Never Too Far Away"" and her re-make of Robert Palmer's ""I Didn't Mean To Turn You On"" (However still not as good as the original). I just have one question, what made her make this album??? Was she held at gunpoint forcing her to make it?? The album has WAY too many rappers that aren't Mariah (HELLO! This IS Mariah's record!!!) and too many overdramatic ballads...nothing is ""special"" about it and it sure nuff don't ""glitter""!! Sorry Mariah, maybe the little dresses have cut off your circulation and you've now forgotten what good music is."
3,Recommended only for lack of better,"This book is really the only available resource covering American Methodism and since it was published in 1974 will soon fall about 40 years short of being current. It covers denominational history in detail, but could do a better job of relating events and trends in the Methodist church to events and trends in U.S. history. Even if this was done very briefly, it would help develop context. As mentioned in another review, the writing style is dry and dated. The editing can be irritating, for example, when the author refers to something like ""the three denominations"" but no where in the entire chapter does it specify which denominations he's discussing. This book gets 4 stars for information covered and about 2 stars for readability."
5,very helpful in the lab,"Although the content of many chapters I already knew, it is still an invaluable reference for the stuff that I didn't know. This book would be especially helpful to anyone starting out in a lab or even as a companion to a chemistry textbook for science students."
1,Go elsewhere,"Odd shape requires an odd bracket, so you can't use old pump brackets on other bikes and swap the pump. Mine was missing the rubber insert required to seal it to a valve stem. It is not worth throwing more money at this one.My advice, find a different pump. This seems to be the general opinion of this pump."
1,Trite and depressing,"This book uses stereotypical characters and cliched settings to create a tragedy of errors in suburbia. The author tackles racism, parenting, literary pretensions, fiscal irresponsibility, artistic ambition, neuroses, competitive spouses, office politics, corporate mergers, and anomie using characters who are no more than shells of real people. The characters revolve around the plot, rather than the plot weaving the characters together. The book is completely unbelievable - it would make an excellent Lifetime movie. All I got for my time was a severe case of reading indigestion."
1,avoid,"I found this book frustrating at many turns. I still can't figure out what the author was trying to say--women should stay at home with their children, it's hard to write a great first novel, nannies are smarter than the people they work for. This book also had some very surprising typos, and an author with little ""ear"" for the way people talk---especially children. The one scene that totally was a thumbs down was when the wife, Andie, gives the nanny a very hard time. The nanny doesn't quit--which would be the case in real life--but, seems to glide through the incident. I was left wondering if the author had his own children, or was an uncle of some sort, watching people, nannies and children at a distance."
3,"Great content, but that's all","After watching 2 of these videos (1 and 8), I learned a good amount of the fundamentals of boxing. It contains info on footwork, punching types and basic combos. I fully intend to watch the rest of the series, however I do not look forward to Chris' presentation style or the video production quality. The overall feel of this video was ""home made"" and Chris' onscreen presence is rather flat. This wasn't helped by his training partner who remained completely silent throughout the entire movie. It could have benefited from real world samples, dynamic camera work and an interactive training partner(s) (not to mention a personality injection).If you want the info and don't care how it's delivered, this series may be what you're looking for. I hope Chris learns a few lessons from this first series and produces something more digestable in the near future."
4,This Mortal Coil on Trance,"The vocals were taken from the song ""Song to the Siren"" By this Mortal Coil, sung by Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins. I f you like delerium, you will love This Mortal Coil as well as Dead can Dance."
4,The glass cover to an 11-inch frying pan that changed my life,"Because of this fabulous cover I can go through my cooking experiences uncovered by grease, garlic or other spitting things that can make my life miserable and messy. You, too, can be transformed if you buy this specific product for this pan but it will most likely fit any 11-inch pan- It's that versatile!"
3,"Not a bad IWB Holster, Snap break is useless","Like my XD holster from Galco this one is surprisingly comfortable to wear for extended periods. The leather is nice and the seams are well crafted. One issue would be that the clip is plastic instead of metal. I thought when I originally read this that the thumb break would be a nice feature but it's pretty much useless. It is not very easy to snap open, digs in to your side and when it's not closed the flaps get in the way. I may actually trim the leather off. The top, as I recall, does not have any reinforcement to aid in reholstering...but since the thumb snap will be in the way that won't be the only issue. All in all this is a good holster but if they offer an option without a thumb break, with a reinforced mouth, I'd recommend that instead."
5,This book is a classic all over the world,"Pippi's way to charm any person reading is a work of art. I own every book and when I have children, they are going to enjoy these books as much as I do."
3,Hey its the kinks,"I always cringe at Greatest hits and singles CDs. Sure this album is great if you're just becoming a new fan of the Kinks. Its great but once become a bigger fan and start buying the albums, this cd becomes slightly useless. So if you are thinking about getting this cd, use this review as a grain of salt. Although if you did get this and then the rest of the albums, you could give this to another new coming fan or leave it in the car."
4,I always buy this,I always buy this. I do not like these boxes. I do care to say anything. That is it I am done.
3,Curious,The full scale goes for this much. Seems a little fishy that anyone would post the scaled version for this much.
3,any one of Ellis's books will do,"You don't have to get all of Albert Ellis's books like I tried to. Well, I bought three at once and it seems to me, they are pretty much all the same. It's helpful if you want to read more about cognitive behaviorial theraphy but I have found that the best book on this is David Burns' ""Feeling Good"" which is really worth it weight in gold. Sorry Dr. Ellis, your books are fine but not as good as Burns' book, I have found.After reading Burns' if you want to read more, go ahead and buy one of Ellis's books and if you like it, read more, but again, Ellis's books seem all pretty similar to me. If you read the bibliography of Ellis's books, he has written dozens which focus on everything from sexual disfucntions to relationship problems, so, be choosy about books of his you buy, but again, if you want to not be miserable but feel good (at least a whole lot better), the FIRST if not the ONLY book is David Burns' ""Feeling Good."" (SEE MY REVIEW)"
1,NONSENSE RAMBLING...,"I found this book to be full of ramblings and fluff. Whatever somehow resembles advice or technique is common sense and useless for those with serious conflict. While I feel that conflict takes two, I don't particularly think it's fair to place all responsibility & work on one person ( usually the victim, or nice person). How about a book on how to not be an A-hole? A much better book is EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL by Susan Foward. E.M. offers true whys and what-you-can-do-about-it that this book suggests, but is somehow disguised as ramblings. Very Disappointed!!"
1,"Great tale, still crappy scan as of February 2012","Love the Destroyer series. Read many of them back in the 80's. All lots of fun, and this is no different.HOWEVER... the Kindle eBook version is riddled with bad scanning errors. Entire lines and paragraphs missing. Weird word switches. Just bad, sloppy stuff.And it looks from the previous reviews like the publisher knew about this, said they'd fix it... and didn't. Because I bought it just this week (February 13, 2012) and it's still very, very messy.PLEASE FIX THIS.Thanks.- A"
1,Boring!!!,"The story concerns a young courtier, Amanzé, whose soul in a previous life was condemned by Brahma to inhabit a series of sofas, and not to be reincarnated in a human body until two virgin lovers had consummated their passion on him. The novel is structured as a frame story in an oriental setting, evocative of the Arabian Nights, in which Amanzé recounts the adventures of seven couples, which he witnessed in his sofa form, to the bored Sultan Shah Baham. I do not blame the Sultan; I was bored, too, by reading this book which is the multiple repetition of the same theme: the battle between the sexes."
1,A waste of money,"This book is definitely NOT ""Complete Preparation for the OAT."" It offers useless generic advice such as not studying late at night. The actual review material is condensed to a few pages and an outline of every topic tested. The instruction even tell you that you can purchase thier MCAT book for more information. All in all, there is nothing in this worthless book that is of any use.I suggest the Exam Kracker series of MCAT books. They have thourough coverage of Bio, Chem, Organic Chemk, Physics and Math. The books are clear and concise and use figures to illustrate the text. Also, review questions are found at the end of every section to gauge understanding. Although these books are a bit more expensive in all, it is worth it."
1,'Wicked' is a waste,"I didn't like 'MWM' for several reasons. The plot, I thought, was contrived. Really, how is the Marquess going to explain to the ton that the wife he has presented around town isn't really his wife after all? The girl would be ruined and he'd be a laughingstock. And isn't it convenient that the actor posing as a minister to marry them really turned out to be a minister after all (as well as an actor). Let's get real. Secondly, the two main characters are almost like shadows with no real depth. Thirdly, I didn't think Hall's writing flowed. In other words, I didn't like her writing style. At all. I was really disappointed in her attempt."
2,Dissapointed,"Foghat is cool, but this collection didnt really have any good ones, they were dumb enough to put the shorter version of slow ride in there instead the full version."
3,Good But Lacking,"This compilation disc was produced for the music fan who either doesn't have any Foghat albums, or just one, maybe two at the most. There are live versions of songs included when the studio version was better, and vice-versa. Home In My Hand should be the studio version, I Just Want To Make Love To You should be live. Road Fever would have been a nice inclusion as well. I am glad Eight Days On The Road is here, it's a great song that is too often overlooked. I was really bummed when I heard Slow Ride, it's the single version, edited and shortened. Either the album cut or the live version is more appropriate, especially considering Foghat's legacy is they were a great live band and did a lot of jamming.Lonesome Dave and Rod Price aren't with us anymore may their rock and roll souls rest in peace. Hopefully, someday, some company will put out an anthology that covers all the right bases."
3,not as good as others claim,"i've read this book, and yes, it indeed does give a rookie good insights on sportsmanship and strategy. but it doesn't offer enough to keep the intermediate player interested. recommended only for the beginner."
4,I enjoyed it,"I enjoyed this book a lot. Sure it's a little outdated, but paintball ain't that complicated, folks, and this book explains the basics clearly. It also provides some good ideas for non-Capture the Flag games and general team motivation and strategies. I definitely recommend it."
2,Ehhhhhhhh..... It could have been better,This book was written back when it was OK to wear shop goggles instead of paintball goggles/mask combos.Because of this this it should be updated or stopped being printed to prevent new players from getting the wrong idea and hurting themselves. I did like the stratigies and the scenerio games were pretty good.Unfortunatly the book was extremely slow and too repetitive.
1,"Poorly written, simple minded, like a middle school kid wrote it",Decent ideas but honestly not worth publishing (or buying). I found it too boring to read and just brainstormed with my friends instead of refering to the book.
1,This is not the real TSOL.,"This album was made with a new TSOL lineup following the departure of their legendary vocalist Jack Grisham. This new version of TSOL eventually deteriorated into a bad glam-metal band, and while this album isn't as bad as later efforts, it's still pretty suck-o. Stick with the real TSOL: ""Dance With Me"", ""Beneath The Shadows"", and their self-titled debut."
5,Beautiful music!,"For anyone who likes Franti AND appreciates music that is not highly produced, here is a beautiful, stripped-down acoustic cd. Even if you're looking for an introduction to Franti, you can't go wrong here. Check it out. You won't be disappointed. Franti's positive message and musicality really shine here. Nice, tasty acoustic guitar and percussion work here too. I'm telling you, check it out!"
4,good music,"We are not to familiar with the artist, but it's nice easy-going music with a reggae flair."
3,Expected More from this curriculum,We have been using the Apologia curriculum for our high school science for 2 years. The other books in this series were challenging. This book leaves us wanting more. Certainly a subject like chemistry could provide more interesting experiments than tying balloons to a yardstick. (Air has volume....we get it. We didn't need to repeat an elementary school level experiment.). This book let us down....we're looking for a new Chemistry curriculum.
5,awesome books at an awesome price,"this was a much cheaper place to buy these science books. we love apologia and w/ more than one child, we're always looking for the best price."
1,lousy fit for '00 Audi A6 2.7T,Got the product *after* confirming it will fit my car. It does not fit - it's too long! How I wish I had read the earlier review *before* I placed the order!Do NOT buy this for an '00 audi A6 2.7T
5,What a show!,"No matter what your taste in musical theater, this DVD has something for you. I was amazed at the depth and breadth of work Cameron Mackintosh has produced. Here is a collection of the well known, e.g., Bernadette Peters singing ""Being Alive"" from Company and Elaine Paige singing ""Memory"" from CATS, and the less known, e.g., Tom Lehrer's ""Poisoning Pigeons in the Park"", from Tomfoolery. Special favorites and highlights for me include the wonderfully talented Ellen Green singing ""Somewhere that's green"" and ""Suddenly Seymour"" from Little Shop of Horrors; Judi Dench doing a moving rendition of ""Send in the Clowns"" from A Little Night Music; David Campbell's all too brief Martin Guerre and Last Night of the World from Miss Saigon introduced me to a terrific new singer. The orignal crew from Side By Side By Sondheim is also wonderful to experience once again. If you like good music; fine performances; and sure fire fun, give this DVD, and also available CD, a listen and a watch."
4,What a production!,"Very entertaining though some musical numbers left me wanting for more. Leave it to Cameron Mackintosh to pull off another production of grandiose proportions with a host of stars that included my favorites: Lea Salonga, Colm Wilkinson, and Michael Ball. What about a 10th anniversary production of Miss Saigon? I'll be waiting..."
3,Close but leaves you wanting,"For those who know all the shows, this video is a great anthology of the musical in the years of the British invasion. Unfortunately, the tape is edited very poorly, and the best part is the end, which shows highlights of the concert which didn't make the tape. You are left wishing they didn't edit it at all and let you see the whole thing. The appeal of a ""concert"" is removed when sloppy edits and the removal of audience applause dimishes the strength and climax to many of the songs (most noteably in ""Somewhere that's Green"")"
5,Beautiful voice,Keith puted together his beatiful voice and beatiful mind in his songs.it's so deep that I wish everybody can just enjoy his music.you can actually here how big heart he has.I love his CD and I heared that there is new commeing.I can't wait.
4,Good punk album,"This is a very underrated(and probably not heard by most)soundtrack album. I'm honestly not a huge punk fan, butthese songs rock pretty well and fit well with a movieabout teenage punks and a less serious movie. ""Partytime""and ""Tonight"" are really good 80's gothic rock songs andare the best tracks on the album. THe song ""Surfin Dead""is also funny. Had this been more a serious movie someof the these songs would have been out of place... Thankfullythe guys that made the movie knew when to play the goofysongs and when to play the rockin stuff. The CD is juststicks to the goth rock gimmick that plays in so much ofthis movie... If you want a soundtrack with a more diversesound then look elsewhere.... If you like 80's goth musicthis is a very underrated album that deserves some attention."
5,For christsakes why isn't Bob Hope dead yet?,"This is one of those albums that I wish I could buy over and over again. I own it on record, tape and Cd. Whenever I see this in a used bin it angers me that someone discarded it for a couple bucks, then I buy it and give it as a gift. This album is up there with Raw Power, Young Loud and Snotty, London Calling, and Exile on Main Street. Oh, and if you like this then you should do yourself a favor and buy the Dictators - Go Girl Crazy."
2,not very good...,"I bought this album awhile back and have listened to it once or twice. While not really horrible, it is simply full of boring music. Boring and tired rock/jazz grooves, nothing new.I like Charlie Hunter as a player. He's an amazing 8 string player (though I don't think that good of a guitarist or bassist), but this sound is tired and is being done way better by other bands.MSMW, Kneebody, Dave Douglas and Keystone. Check out these bands for some killer (FRESH) jazz/experimental rock."
2,"Says ""intermediate,"" but it's pretty basic","I've recently resumed playing base after a (very) long hiatus. While I'm progressing well in reacquiring my skills with bass (this time on an upright), I thought I could augment the learning process by purchase of an ""intermediate"" bass DVD - specifically for Bluegrass music.So, I purchased this DVD. While it contains information and instruction that would benefit folks just starting to play the upright bass, it was just too basic for me."
5,a servant of the Lord,This is a beautiful - beautiful book. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to draw closer to Jesus - to know how to love Jesus more.
1,bad remaster great show,"There is no discussion about how great these shows were. I was lucky enough to experience them on tv in 1964. The 2003 edition was wonderful. When the studio that remastered these dvds said that they were going toclean up the film ""frame by frame"", I was expecting a significant improvement. When I compared each show to the 2003 dvd, the 2nd show seemed brighter, but there was no improved video or sound definition. The other3 shows were inferior in clarity. How can these people take a step backwards in quality, and sell the product as being remastered? For the best product, seek the 2003 version. Note, the bonus material is worthless.A more appropriate bonus might have been to include the beatles' rehearsal songs which you can see on you tube for the 1964 performances."
5,Kings indeed,"With details of troop deployments and excerpts from speeches kings deliver to their men before battle, it becomes obvious it is unlikely that the details are historically accurate. Little time is spent discussing personal relationships; most of the stories revolve around battle. The book is easy reading for the most part. Some of the details offered before any given battle are hard to understand, but they rarely have a significant impact on the course of the plot. The price is more than fair, considering the volume of the book itself and the multitude of fantastic stories. Despite the fact that the work cannot be considered a true source of history, there is still a great deal of educational value."
3,Just OK,"This is an interesting CD. Unmistakably M. Ward, but not so melodic or polished. It seems funny to use that word for a guy who records in his attic, and wants his music to sound like it, but later M. Ward has a fuller sound, more instruments, and the occasional song you want to hum along to. None of that here. He seems to be channeling early Neil Young but more whispery. This would make good background music, but if I want the full M. Ward experience I am more likely to put End of Amnesia, Vincent, or Post-War on the turntable."
5,Wedding Collection,"The product was recieved timely, which is most important to me. The songs are exactly what I need to complete my daughter's wedding. I highly recommend Amazon to everyone."
3,It is ok,I think the book is interesting but there are much easier methods to use to lose weight. I ending up trying something else and lost 10 lbs the first month. This book is too detailed of a process for me....takes too much energy. I ended up just reducing my food to 1200 calories and working out.....I used lean cuisines to help with that reduction.
2,TESTER,"I have been wearing this scent for years. Everyone loves it. I just ordered this last bottle and it comes wrapped in bubble wrap and not in the box. It also has ""TESTER"" on it. I was not made aware that this was a tester bottle. To me it has an odd smell, like it's old or something. Very disappointed that I was not made aware that this was a tester bottle. This concerns me because the bottle is full, of what I don't know, and it wasn't in the proper packaging. Something is very wrong with this."
4,Mistaken instructions.,Instruction manual says to point the device in any direction and push the button. In reality one should push the button and HOLD it for the time the device scans the ambient and locates a WiFi signal in which case leds will light. Pushing the button simply does not work. However this is not a failure of the device which works fine. Very practical.
4,Loved it,"4 stars was a cute romantic comedy, love the storyline and parts of the movie were funny. Jennifer love Hewitt makes this movie funny"
1,A Big Disappointment,It's obvious why this went straight to video. It's poorly written and badly uses two performers who have been so engaging in past movies. Jennifer Love Hewitt looks awful and her acting is self-conscious. Dougray Scott looks old and tired and his acting is leaden. He seemed destined to be a huge star a few years ago. What is he doing in movies like this?
1,Retched,"Truth About Love is horrible. In the first 5 minutes, Love's British actrice makes you cringe and sways your attention away from the movie. The rest of the movie is cliche and boring. It's an unfunny romantic love story. Truth about love is no ""Love Actually."""
2,allison (a high school student),First of all the book isn't all bad. I enjoyed the beginning even if it was a very quick read. But the book quickly went from being good to being horrible. The end of this book is stupid and too far out there for people to believe. Save your money and the hour it will take you to read this book and find something that is more interesting. There are much better books out there.
4,"Entertaining, quick read","I finished this book in a very short amount of time and was left feeling pretty satisfied. The story is very entertaining. I walked away feeling both sad and elated for the main character, Lonnie. The one regret that I had about this book was the ending, I wish that it had ended differently. I would definitely suggest this book to a friend."
5,"A great, though short compilation.","This album as most already know, is a compilation album. It is filled with some of Ruben's well known characters Paula C, La Mora, Pablo Pueblo and my one of my favorites Juan Pachanga. The beauty of Ruben's music is his ability to create characters that reflect everyday situations and really most people's feelings in general. Who hasn't felt like Juan Pachanga or at least known a Pablo Pueblo in their lives. Combine great lyrics with great music and what you have is the perfect combination, you have true music. Ruben creates just that music. Add Canto Abacua from Ray Barretto and it just adds to the greatness."
1,Looks Great on Paper,"This unit looked great on paper and I was excited at the prospect of scanning my old slides and negatives but the soft ware provided with this unit has serious flaws and tech support is less than helpful (the understatement of the year). I have other scanners and a state of the art PC, but in spite of waiting on hold forever (TOLL CALL) nothing works. The e-mail support is worthless."
2,Secrets of the Sages still theirs...,"This book had all the promise of a wonderfull reference for game programming. What it turned out to be is a book that speaks much about how to get ideas for a game and NOTHING about actually making the game. If you are looking for someone to tell you were to get ideas for a game then this book will be good for you. For the programmer that wants to learn about actually designing the game, STAY AWAY! Spend the bucks somewhere else."
2,I still don't know if it works,"I have no idea if it's working or not. I don't feel that different. What does it actually do, really? I don't know. And I bought it to play golf. I've seen so many people with it, talking about how it increases stamina and gives you pain relief - I honestly do not know if it's doing it, I don't feel any different."
5,WHY I'M BUYING THIS MOVIE FOR THE 3RD TIME,"I too think this is a wonderfu, funny, offbeat and weird movie that should be available on DVD. A great, friendly satire on some obvious Jewish stereotyes, and some not so obvious, which viewers who are not Jewish might miss. I'm buying this movie for the third time now. I keep loaning it to rabbi's who tell me how much they enjoyed the movie, but never give it back."
3,Pretty Good But There are Better for the Same Price,"I recently bought the Canon 8400 after having a Sony CCD 8 mm (non HI-8 format) for 5-6 years, which was great. Here are the Canon's Pros: It's small and light weight. It has a light and image stabilization. It has a LCD screen. It has a high power zoom.Canon's Cons: Compared to the Sony, I'm a little disappointed in the picture quality. Although the zoom is easy to use, the picture quality was fairly grainy, even at what I would consider relatively short distances (15-20 feet). I frankly don't think it's any better than the Sony non-Hi-8 format. Also, the 2.5"" LCD screen is too small.I think if I were buying again, I would look more seriously at the Sony's. The comparable price point Sony model didn't have image stabilization; however, that feature I now realize isn't as important as picture quality."
4,The Best in Hi8 Model - Good Customer Support,"I had bought a ES2000 model (very first model in Hi8 - 6 Years ago) and I like it. Accidentally, I had dropped it and called the Customer Service (luckily, it was just before the 1 year warranty expiry). They were very nice and they adviced me to take it to a local repair center. Found out that the motor was damaged and got it repaired within 20 Days. I was using it after that and it didn't give any problem for a long time after that. I have adviced my friends and they like this model.Now, I recently bought the OPTURA 100MC camcorder, as I wanted to burn DVD/VCD and get digital quality.If you want a cheaper camcorder, this is good. If you are willing to pay some $$, Optura 200MC (Recently released) is good. Compared to Sony, far cheaper and better quality."
3,This is not a CD!,"Ok, you're probably smarter than me and have already realized it: This is a DVD, not a CD. Why Amazon chose to distort the cover to a square so it LOOKS like a CD is their secret. They don't do this with other music DVDs. I like the music (some better, some less so, but that's normal) but I was not pleased not to be able to download it on my iPod. I specifically bought conversion software for that purpose and spent hours editing it... don't ask. Just to let you know."
2,DISAPPOINTING....MEDIOCRE ....,"I guess I was expecting a little bit too much from this dvd, having just watched ""Concert for George.""This show somehow failed to show John's genius through the mediocre performance of the guest artists.One thing that annoyed me was the TALKKKK!!! There was quite a bit of guest appearances...actors and actresses, in between performances. One satisfaction I get from buying a good concert DVD is the fact that I can play and listen to it over and over again while I'm doing my chores at home during weekends like a regular CD or help put myself to sleep at night watching it in my bedroom TV. This is not one of those DVDs. Yeah, I would probably watch this dvd one more time, just to watch and listen to Across the Universe, but that's about it. I'm actually thinking of selling my dvd already. The only other positive thing I can say about this DVD is the DTS option, hence the 2 stars. Ergo, if you own ""Concert for George"" DVD, you will be disappointed with this one."
4,ok,"after Yolanda Adams's performance i thought i found an amazing music dvd, but no. other artists arent that good, some of them shouldnt have shown up. you cant sing a john lennon song half asleep (moby).Kevin Spacey sings mind games, - amazing! he's quite good!also skipping cheesy in-between songs speaches is a must, too bad for 9-11, otherwise it could have been just a regular lennon tribute.too bad for lennon too... could have been a nice lennon concert...oh well."
4,Psychedelia-Lite; An Overlooked Piece of Trippy Nostalgia,"Pop Kulcher Review: The Rain Parade were one of the better bands in Southern California's early-80s ""paisley underground,"" presenting a laid-back, neo-psychedelic sound that made for excellent (if relatively unexciting) background music. This album is full of melodic, meandering gems which hang in their air and wash over you. Despite a reasonable amount of reverb creating an odd distancing effect, the psychedelic feel is created more through relaxed pacing and jangling guitars than through special effects. A thoroughly enjoyable outing for sixties afficianados. (Guitarist David Roback later formed Opal with the Dream Syndicate's Kendra Smith, as well as the better known Mazzy Star.)"
4,Buy it on iTunes,"This is a great CD, but the prices that these third-party sellers are asking are lunacy. You can download this album from the iTunes Music Store for 99 cents/song. Check debtalan.com for updated info on where's best to get all her CDs. My favorite Deb Talan album, Something Burning, is still in print and is sold here at Amazon, so get that, too while it's still around!Deb is now playing with Steve Tannen under the name, The Weepies. Her sound hasn't really changed, so if you like her solo stuff, you'll enjoy The Weepies as well."
3,Great picture - audio very lacking,"The picture was probably as good as you can get from an older movie, but I was disappointed in the sound. The audio sounded very flat to me with zero attention given to improving the sound quality over the original. So while I thought it picture was great, the audio quality was not good. Still a fantastic movie, though."
5,Vietnam. FUBAR!!,"I've read a couple of reviews that downgraded this film as being unrealistic. Of, course only the most sensational aspects of the war are portrayed. Duh, it's a movie. I wasn't over there. The war mercifully ended weeks before I would have been. I do have numerous friends who were. Many will not really talk about it (just like my dad who served 4 years in WWII and saw heavy action. Only after his death have I realized how scarred he was by that experience). I know a guy who used to tell me horror stories similar to those portrayed in this movie. 10 years ago he would tell these stories like jokes and laugh like crazy. I would think ""That is one hardcore SOB!"" Nowadays he can't talk about Vietnam without breaking down and sobbing and crying. I can see now that he has been living in hell for 30+ years. Maybe this film is unrealistic in the fact that this wasn't the average soldier's experience. I think about 50,000 or so just got killed. This crap did happen though."
4,The Popular Guidebook Now Has Prices Revised for 1999,"This beautiful 352 page identification and value guide has been updated with 1999 prices. It contains over 2,300 full color, large, sharp photos. Provides collector's tips, the McDonald's Story, the early days and more history. Nearly every type of McDonald collectible is included. Every category is clearly described. A valuable reference work that will be referred to often !"
5,"Feast for the ears, feast for the soul.","An absolutely stunning melodic soundscape from what is rapidly becoming my favorite band. From the dramatic opening crecendo leading into the soft, soothing whispers and vocals on ""Flowers Become Screens"", to the powerful instrumentation of ""Gateway"", this masterpiece is surely destined to become a major classic. In times of stress, do yourself a great favor. Listen to this gem through a decent pair of headphones and let it transport you into a serene-like state. The followup album, ""Karma"", might possibly be even better."
4,Derivative but who cares?,"Let's face it, if someone told you this was Enigma you'd believe it - but that's irrelevant. This has grooves, tunes, fantastic vocals, and (this can be important) you know what you're getting. Sure, sometimes you want to be shocked by originality - but if you want music guaranteed to chill the blackest moods, this can't be beaten."
4,The change in Delerium begins,"This album was released in 1995 after 'Spheres II' and it can be defined as the beginning of change of styles for Delerium from its early dark ambient theme (which I love) to more of a trance/softer approach. In saying this, there are still a number of notable songs on this album which became hits and many of these songs are remixed on other later albums to great effect. The first part of the album starts off ambient and dark in feel and by Metamorphesis the change in Delerium is underway. The next album 'Poem' showed fans the new type of Delerium.However on this album release the standout songs are Incantation and Consensual Worlds. These songs are magical with the female vocalists excelling. I didn't particularly like the last three songs of the album which showed the transformation taking place style wise.This album heralded the change in Delerium and brought the group new fans and unfortunately did antagonise old early Delerium fans."
3,"Eh, ok.","It's a ok amp I suppose, I had 400 watt older edition and loved it cause it had bass boost and a few other settings, this amp is just pure tremble and produces no bass with my 6X9's I have for my fourwheeler. I'll prob just buy two more 5x7's and use the 4 channels for the boat."
3,Good choice if you have not already seen Poly Matrix,"I give this a 3 because it's almost the same as the Poly Matrix Movie. It's just chopped up to 4 series and added a few new scenes to the begining of each searies. I got both not knowing this was the same as Poly Matrix, just a way to swindle people into buying more. If you have not seen Poly Matrix get this instead, but if you have Poly Matrix, don't waste your money on this."
1,Never had in stock and never acknowledged my order.,I ordered these earings for my girlfriend's birthday and never received a confirmation of the order. I waited for a few days then called. They said then that they were out of stock. I go on Amazon today and they still say in stock and they are even offering $50.00 off at checkout. Well isnt that special. Offering $50.00 off an iten and saying it is in stock when it is not kinda rubs me the wrong way. I needed these things and now I am screwed. I would think twice before orderng from this company.
5,musical genius,"When I bought this CD, I was familiar with Aphex Twin as someone who twiddled with weird and shocking noises to produce something that didn't exactly sound like music, but was so interesting and flat-out crazy that one's attention was instantly captured (despite the headache and ringing in the ears that inevitably followed).This is a very different Aphex Twin from the one that I was familiar with. The album is atmospheric, subtle and intricate - entirely unlike the watered-down Muzak sound that so horribly plagues most so-called ""ambient"" music out there. Actually, ""ambient"" is a bit of a misnomer; most of the tracks have a subtle, but persistent beat, so perhaps ""intelligent techno"" would be a better term. If you like Orbital, Boards of Canada, Future Sound of London, then you will love ""Selected Ambient Works 85-92"". If, on the other hand, you are a dance-happy trancer who walks around with lightsticks, then you probably won't have much fun with this ablum."
5,Aphex Twin Selected Ambient Works,"An essential classic album for any electronic music lover. Whether you like classic house, electro, ambient or Detroit techno, this album embodied them all and was done before most knew who he was."
4,The Connells are Back!,"Their best effort since ""Ring"", ""Old School Drop Outs"" is full of catchy songs that you can't get out of your head. Too bad these songs won't be heard by anyone except for die-hard fans. Such a small label cannot possible promote this adequately. The production is the only thing that prevented me from giving it five stars. About a third of the songs were recorded using an analog 4-track and the remainder with DAT. The sound just isn't as crisp as on their past work. All in all a welcomed return from a band I didn't think I'd hear from again!"
1,Connells Drop Out - was it the Drummer?,"I can't believe this is the long-awaited follow-up to ""Still Life"". This CD sounds as if I recorded it on a cassette tape off a scratchy vinyl LP then left it out in the rain for three weeks before playing it on my beat 70's clock radio and listening to it through my cell with about 1 bar of reception. Yes, it's that bad! AND, I have been following this band since their inception - or at least since they got good enough to tour away from Raleigh (best show? Blind Pig in Ann Arbor 1993) and I've seen them perform 4-5 times over the last 10-12 years and they ROCK. I love them, but perhaps the departure of the original drummer Peele was for a good reason after all - maybe it's just too much heartache and jagermeister? Whatev, it's not what we expect and demand from guys like the Connells with so much heart and talent. C'mon fellas - you owe us all a good album to follow up this ""Weird Food'esque"" trash. And soon, please. xoxo"
5,Huge Fan of this Show,"I was ecstatic to learn that I could instantly download and access the season through the new Video on Demand feature. No longer do you have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. I always love the creative way the writers and directors portray what is ordinary in life and make it so interesting and dramatic, yet give it a realism that anyone can relate to. Comic relief not only for the women in the world, but surprisingly the men. This was indeed a great show and every season was cause to celebrate. I am very saddened that it has come to an end. Great run ladies! and hunks!"
4,Great final,"Maybe not the best season of the show, but it's a very satisfying end for this great TV show. We'll never forget our housewives"
2,I was open-minded..yet the door began to shut,"I began reading this book with the hope that it would open up a new narrative to me of a world that I thought I had, for many years, shared in some format or another. However, while reading the first 10 chapters, it appeared to me as an over-engrossed blog full, not of insightful learning/challenging experiences, but of the author's need to explore every vocabulary word that she could dig out of her mind to describe foods that she wanted to eat. To me, it got old fast..off topic...seemed like the 'worse case scenario' of any experience, had this author at its worst demise. Just seemed too 'poor me' and truthfully, unbelievable at many turns. To the point that..I felt..she was just trying to fill up the pages was nothingness as her publisher made her have a quota of pages to turn in, more than the rough draft she might have initially presented. As you would probably guess, I don't suggest you run out to buy this one."
1,"This is not a book about being fat, its about hating yourself","I am fat, and I have always been fat. I have never hated myself. I was a fat child, nobody ever made fun of me, called me names, molested me at recess or in the movies, and while my childhood was not a bed of roses, it was not because I was fat. This woman hates herself and I feel sorry for her, but it makes me angry that she blames all her problems on food. Her mother was abusive, told her she wished she had never been born, that she was useless and ugly. She slapped her and cursed her and made her life miserable and she blames it all on being fat. But if she had not been fat, her mother would have found another excuse for the abuse, because she had a problem, not the child. This book just perpetuates the idea that all fat people are miserable and it simply is not true. Too many people blame their misery on being fat, but most fat people are truly happy...At least this one is....Leave this book on the shelf..."
3,"Unrelenting, but I guess that's the point","Judith Moore is fat. She was a fat child, a fat teenager and is a fat adult. But more than that, she suffered a horrible childhood where she was starved for affection and understanding. I completely understand her point, but I found the book to be depressing and abrupt. To her credit, she did indicate that it wasn't one of those ""touchy-feely"" books with a happy ending, but I guess I was still looking for....something. But maybe that's the whole point."
4,very nice book,"very nice book, but if you dont like reading about food, i dont thinks its a good idea for you..."
2,A Little Draining,"I really wanted to like this book. Her experiences of abuse made me feel deeply for her and I appreciated many parts of it but just could get beyond her hatred of herself and the description of smells. I know that sounds strange but read the other reviews and it'll make sense. After I read this book, I felt a little emotionally exhausted. It must be what a psychologist feels like at the end of the working week. Additionally, because of all the self-loathing fat body smelling description portions of this book, I felt a little sick to my stomach and skipped lunch. Okay, that's a little ironic. Anyway, go get it from your library if you are curious. I spent 99 cents on it at goodwill and will definitely be donating it right back."
4,A quick entertaining read,"First, this book can easily be read in one or two sittings, that being said, it's not worth the hardcover $16 list price. Pick up a copy here for a couple bucks and all is well. Otherwise, i found this book to be a page turner. The author has a great ""story telling"" writing style. This book is a little step back in time, fortean in nature, and educational all in one short, well illustrated book."
5,Phineas Gage,"Phineas GageBy: John FleischmanPhineas Gage is a book about a rail road worker who got a tamping iron shuved though his head and walked away. He got help from a doctor to get it out. He was famous and lived for seven years after. He had a few sezurs and died. Now there`s a memorial for him at Harvard Medical College.He is a Forman for a rail road. He is about six foot and wears 1830s type Cloths. He doesn`t like very many people, only the people he works with. He can be a mean guy. He doesn`t like Doctors at all, they scare him.I liked this book, because I learned a lot about brain science. I also earned a lot about the history of brain science. My favorite part is when he got the tamping iron put in his head. Yes I would recommend this book to a friend."
3,Science buffs will love this one.,"Phineas Gage survived for about 10 years after a 13-pound iron rod shot through his brain while he was working on building a railroad. The events of September 13, 1848 changed not only Gage's life, but the course of brain science as well.The author mixes accounts of Gage's life before and after the accident with scientific explanations. Illustrations such as photographs, drawings, and diagrams help explain Gage's life and how the brain works."
4,OK book,Bought for my husband. He thought it was really cool. Seemed very thin and for a younger reader(middle school or maybe high school)
2,"A true NOVELTY number, only for the strong-willed!","As I was enjoying the fun and sun of an area theme park, my ears caught the recognizable ""voice"" of Crystal Waters, warbling as the familiar ""Price is Right"" theme played in the background. Walking with my four-year-old niece, I began to step to the infectious tune, becoming totally enraptured in the rhythms.I had to find that song.Well, find it I did and I wish I hadn't.For some reason, outside of the confines of the theme park, the song loses much of its appeal, weakening to a rather routine bit of retro disco. It's more of an oddity and probably belongs in one's audio collection for that reason alone.Because this ""single"" recycles the song seven times, this one belongs in the cutout or maybe the two-for-a-dollar bin."
1,Nope,"Hardly Funny. Just Raunchy uneventful, poorly attempted humor. Most of his studdering goes off on rants that aren't even funny, just opinionated. It's obvious that he has crooners in the audience to make it seem like he's funny."
4,Destined for greatness,"Stanhope is going all the way to the top of the comedy slag heap, somehow, at some point, despite and because of his accurate honesty about America. His timing and material get better year after year, and he's fast on his feet, especially when drunk, which is usually.I first saw him in 1999 at a little dive with 20 people. He came on for the second show good and hammered, drank like a fish the whole set, and just got funnier and funnier until the room exploded and the bartender was laughing so hard he couldn't pour drinks. Never saw that before or since.Stanhope's stand-up is take-no-prisoners; leave your sensitive side at home. If you've got an open mind and a strong stomach, he's one of the funniest comics out there today."
1,tyrants of lydia against the son of hercules,"sadly this item belongs to one of those ""most of the sword-and-sandal movies that are available on DVD are panned-and-scanned, and typically are of poor image quality"". not recommanded."
3,Super deluxe box doesn't include all that Amazon said would be included.,"A nice set; hey, it's the Stones, but Amazon has listed items that were supposed to be included, but aren't:""12 X 12 replica of the original 1969 tour book and poster by Grammy Award winning artist David Byrd, whose works include the commemorative poster from the original Woodstock Festival and the historic Fillmore East posters from 1968 to 1971.""Again, the tour book and poster are NOT included. I took 2 stars off my review. C'mon, Amazon. False advertising!"
4,get your yayas out,"The box set of the Rolling Stones live album from 1969 is very good. The sound quality is good, but nothing remarkably better than the original. The bonus discs, the extra tracks, Satisfaction is OK but the other tracks aren`t the best versions. The Support acts of BB King and Ike and Tina Turner are good, the DVD is nothing remarkable, the booklet that comes with the box is very good, with good photos.If you`re a fan or a collector its well worth getting, but if you just want the album save yourself and just get the CD."
4,Cover is Thin,There were no surprises for me in this package. I got what I wanted and paid for. However I'll warn potential buyers that the cover of the gatefold lp set is extremely thin and will tear very easily. I thought I was being careful and I still ended up with a tear in the cover. Handle the lps with care.
5,Worth paying a few extra dollars for this,"Prior to buying this I was a little apprehensive as I had read some less than complimentary reviews on Rolling Stones chat sites. Most people had an issue paying top dollar for what they percieved as re-packaged material. But I found otherwise. The DVD of outtake footage from the 1969 tour, although only 28 minutes in length, is superb. There is a sublime scene of the Stones and The Grateful Dead at a heliport about to head out to Altamont. Jagger clowns around while Jerry Garcia chuckles in the background. Priceless footage. The CD of BB King and Ike and Tina Turner and the 5 unreleased Stones tracks are also welcome new material and the enclosed Ethan Russell book is a very nice touch. In short, a little expensive but probably worht it for the die hard Stones fan."
5,AWESOME STONES PACKAGE,"To all Stones fans world wide, This is a Truely Awesome Package a must have for not just any Stones Fan but for music lovers of all genres.Great StuffMichael Chambers Sydney Australia"
4,"Old Live Stones, Ya Ya","I remember hearing this album when it first came out and wasn't impressed with the sound quality...even for the day. That is much improved now and the addition of BB King and Ike and Tina's opening set is a worthwhile addition. The booklet is great, especially the photos. Haven't watched the DVD yet, but all else is very good. I likes it."
5,Who is Dan Epstein?,"The editorial review by someone called Dan Epstein should be ignored. Given that this is a live 1969 recording it is not a grand example of hi-fi..........but in terms of musical excellence it ranks along with the very best........wonderful guitar work......and an atmosphere rarely created on live recordings from the 60s (with the exception of Billie & Dede Pearce). On vinyl even ""a grown man can cry""......it is so good. When I go to the grave I shall take this with ""Trout Mask Replica"". Buy it now.........and then wait for the ""Gimme Shelter"" video in December 2000."
4,Great Speech Tool,My child has a speech problem. This helps her hear what I hear. With this my child works on her sounds and now is getting them right. This is not a immediate fix all but it is a great tool to fixing speech problems.
4,"Read this book, I think","I'm one of those people who never reads books and then tells other people not to read them either. So, whateever you do, DON'T READ THIS BOOK. If you do you might think about stuff you wouldn't normally think about. At least that's what I believe all books do, but I wouldn't know because I just critize books, I've actually never read one."
2,Hopefully Honest,"Before reading ""Elitist Camelback Gaga"" I had never delved into the world of the extremely surreal (I'm not even sure what the hell that really means) and my virginal experience didn't quite get me begging for more. I can appreciate the mixture of the written word with the various visual stimulants contained within Gaga, but I personally thought that the overall concept interfered, rather than aided, in my enjoyment of the plot. I don't want to push anyone away from this book for I am obviously not connoisseur of the genre and therefore am not really qualified to make any harsh criticisms. I can however give this bit of advice; if you want to experience something that will challenge the socially constructed ideals on which books are based, dive on in. If you however are like me and enjoy a more straight forward approach to reading, steer clear."
1,WARNING,By original material. This is GREAT MUSIC performed horribly. Please listen to the samples before you purchase!!!!! This is NOT the original recordings!!!
4,"missing gem, still missing","While I love this CD, it is missing something. Perhaps the rest of the Byrds. The songs are great, but the performances seem sleepy. The overall tone is deeply sad. I wanted some high flying harmonies, but what I got was some back to sticks and stems again stoner lethargy."
5,Well worth the price,I have drilled well over 500 holes with this one and there is no sign of wear at all !
3,Failure,I think Need for speed sucked! i thought this game was not cool at all becuse your car is hareder to control and if you have a break away from anyone else a car will apear right in front of you.
4,One of the best DS games out!,"Besides Mario 64, this is the best DS game out.Pros:-AMAZING graphics!-You can unlock MANY parts for your cars, and customize them-The touch screen makes it easy to choose parts and make your car the way you want-You can draw your own decals to put on your car with the touch screen-There are mini games to playCons:-If you want to do multiplayer, you need to have 2 game cards, one for you, and one for your friend/whoever.-Some mini games are VERY hard-Drawing decals isn't that easy. It's not like ""Pictochat"", they give you BIG pixils to color, so the decals come out really bad.Overall, I give the game 8.8/10I think you should get it, the replay value is excelent! One of the best DS games ever!"
5,Great Book Club Book,"We just read this for book club and it's the first time in ten years everyone actually finished the book! We are all busy moms but this book is such a fast read, and the plot is so gripping, there's no head nodding when reading late at night. But, more importantly, it was a great discussion, since the book touches on many universal topics such as the gap in understanding between generations, and yet how important those relationships can be. I always love a book where I learn so much about a culture different from my own, and Only the Eyes are Mine is an eye opening portrayal of Indian culture. Many thanks to the author!"
4,Yummy,I love adding this syrup to my margaritas! they taste fantastic and have a beautiful pink glow to them now. A little pricey for what you get though.
4,A Pretty Good Book!,"I liked the book, but I like most of Troy Taylor's books and own many of them. Troy takes a great interest in not only the haunting aspect of his stories but the history behind them for added background information. I found the stories in the book concerning ""vanishing"" people - those folks who just seemed to disappear without a trace especially creepy and interesting. I do know one thing, after reading this book, I won't go hiking/ walking alone on a deserted road or trail ever! Also included in the book, Troy takes a stab at Bigfoot, werewolves and other strange creatures. There is also a section on haunted roads and the story of the infamous ""Donner Party."" Check out Troy's web site at www.prairieghosts.com. I have always found him to be very personable and willing to answer your questions by email."
1,Misleading product information.,"Anyone thinking of buying this dvd should know that the main feature is only about 30 minutes long. The rest of the 70 minutes is filler. I was disappointed in the product. The short film is ok, but definitely NOT WORTH THE PRICE."
2,Very weak Rodgers and Hammerstein,"This is probably the weakest of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals and watching or listening to it is a test of your endurance. Its best song, ""I enjoy being a girl"", sounds suspiciously like a rewrite of several other R and H songs. R and H were taking it easy when they cranked this one out and it shows. Tedious and very dated. Do not expect a revival of this show."
3,Does its job but...........,It is very elegant and well made. Does protect from the sun as advertised.The problem is that if you so much lean against the pool's edge it gets scraped.So after 3 wearings it looks terrible.
5,let your freak flag fly,it may overstate his importance in the theater world BUT he deserves to be recognized for achieving the level of success that he has...letting his freak flag fly.
5,A Must read about a WW1 Combat Soldiers experiences.,"This book was written by the hand of a Infantry man and his views are straight from the battlefield.I am a Vietnam Infantryman and I can feel his feelings and attitudes as if I were there with him.Read it's spellbounding action and true accounts,It was written in the words of one who served in the Trenches, not someone sitting in a comfy office somewhere when the war went on.The book has sold so many copies over the years that it has been reprinted many. many times.This copy was printed in the last year, it's condition is New.The original copy was printed in 1935......and as the jacket said . ""We apoligize for the many reprints but all copies written to date have been read so much they have literally fallen apart""."
5,A BIT WORDY BUT THE SNIPER INFO. IS TIMELESS.,"IF YOU CAN SLOG THRU THE MIDLLE OF THE BOOK THE BEGINING AND THE END ARE QUITE GOOD. THE SHOOTING INFORMATION IS VERY VALUBALE. I DID NOT START OUT TO READ THIS BOOK FOR THE HISTORY, BUT IT IS ACCURATE AND INTERTANING."
2,Eh,"I had different expectations for this dvd, none of which were fulfilled. I'm actually trying to sell the dvd I bought. There is very little, if none, nudity. The graphics are bad. It's like when you see a ""making of"" featurette and you see these pre-finalized cg images moving very erratically. That exactly is how it looks. The so-called story was as if someone said ""hey you're trying to make hentai? I have a cool-yet-derivative story that you can slap on it so that people won't say it's just plotless porn."""
1,IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU NEVER SEE THIS!!!!!,"I'm really not sure what they were going for with this movie, but they never achieved it!! If it's hentai or anime you are looking for this is NOT it!! There really is no plot or point to this movie. This is absolutlly the WORST movie I have ever seen!!"
1,"Good music, truly horrible singer.","If you like that awful singer from Hootie and the Blowfish, you'll probably like this guy too. If, like me, you'd rather be shot at sunrise than listen to Pootie and the Yuckfish, you won't like this CD much. The music sounds good, and pretty much every song starts out with real promise. Then that guy starts to sing and you dive for the forward button. Yuck, yuck, yuck! If only they would play loud enough to drown him out!"
2,Pop music with a flamenco flavor,"Boom, boom, boom. No musical imagination. While I am a believer in the melding of musical traditions, and am reluctant to sound like an elitist, slapping a dance beat onto the flamenco sound results in musical pablum. While this will appeal to many, it is not for people who know music. It is at least the music of happiness and optimism, but there is much better."
3,Ok Bike Rack,"It is a little light so every time you take a bike out of it you wind up dragging it out of place. I need to put sandbags on the ends.We have four bikes in it (two adult, two kid) and the adult bikes cannot fit in the tire slots properly, they are too narrow. It's a tight fit and when you try to pop your tire out of the slot the whole thing moves. Not the best, but it was pretty inexpensive and I feel like we got our moneys worth."
3,A readily available spare part,"What can I say about this - we needed a new 'flapper', it was available as a spare part and we bought it. It has served it purpose and all is well again with the WC now."
1,Cheap.,"While trying to install this on my toilet, one end just snapped off, with very little pressure. Very cheaply made and very disappointed."
4,Its about life....,"Like all of Buechner's books, I can't tell you what they are about. They are about life. Its ups and downs and sorrows and joys. Buechner writes prose like he is a poet. Sure, he's a Calvinist preacher, but he isn't as curt as C.S. Lewis can be, and he is certainly not going to cram Christianity down your throat. I bawled through Chapters 7 & 8, and read the whole book in one afternoon. I will be reading it again, for sure."
5,Extremely good book,"Simple, concise, yet by no means limited. I learned essentially all the postscript that I needed to know for my job in about 3 hours reading this book. Excellent examples, easy to follow, what could more could you ask for?"
4,Understanding the Mormons,We spent a summer in Utah. I bought this book to learn about the history of the areas we were visiting. I learned about the plight of the Mormons.
3,Velvet Rope is better,"I attended both tours and own both of the HBO shows and I can honestly say Velvet Rope is a much better tour. All For You is only better because of the bright colours onstage and Janet dressed up more girly, but Velvet Rope was all about the music and art, not the stripping and changing backstage."
2,"Totally Agree With The Reviewer From Santa Clara, California","It was quite boring! Other than watching Janet change costumes, there really wasn't anything that kept my attention on this one. Get the Velet Rope concert from Madison Square Garden instead. It was much more exciting and electric!"
3,The only game of its kind,"... on the DS, that is.The good:- Fantastic background graphics and an incredibly smooth frame rate- Some really cool weapons- Enjoyably retro music- Lots of different modes- Online high score table and challenges make for great replayability- Cool touch-screen radar- Many unlockables- Some cool bosses- Most importantly, it's the only scrolling shooter the DS may get for a long time.The bad:- I only really use two out of the four weapons, because having to hit the others on the touch screen usually isn't worth it- Bottom-screen radar is useless- Did I mention the touch screen usage is terrible?- In all modes, scores are kept only if you beat a level!- Some of the mission modes are next to impossible- Enemy designs, while nice, are repetitive- Unlockables, so far, are terrible- Really anticlimactic, rather easy final level. Last boss is disappointingly bland and cliche.It's no Layer Section or Ikaruga, but it's the only game of its kind on the DS and it's quite enjoyable."
4,Nanostray,"Nanostray is a great game. Its fun addictive and easy to play. My only real complaint is that the campaign is to short, I beat it in a few hours. But the arcade mode is great, possibly better than the campaign. Its definatly worth buying."
5,Very Enjoyable And From The Heart,"Into Your Heart is one of the best CD's I've heard in some time. There are no bad tracks, which makes this CD highly enjoyable each time you listen to it. Mick Hucknall of Simply Red once penned that he was 'one of those grains of sand that gets blown all around the world'and that sentiment truly describes the life of all musicians. Tom Schuman has brought his memories of special places and people to Into Your Heart. The CD is masterfully crafted and is garnering rave reviews from all who hear it. Check out this CD it will become a soundtrack you can't live without. Tom Schuman is a terrific live musician, so don't miss any opportunity to hear his performances in person..."
4,Excellent series opener with Joanna Brady an engaging sleuth,"Not as gritty as the J.P. Beaumont mysteries, yet recently widowed Joanna Brady is one tough and determined sleuth who juggles crime solving, the new demands of single parenthood, and her own personal bereavement with finesse. A terrific series I intend to follow!"
5,Mother in-law introduced me to Joanna Brady,"As a huge fan of the Alex Cross series by James Patterson which I introduced my mother in-law to, she introduced me to JA Jance's Joanna Brady series. Thanks Mom! I loved it. As soon as I finished this one it was on to the next and the next! It's great to have a strong female character that isn't trashy."
4,A very interesting origin.,"I found this book to relate a touching, and very different origin of a crime-solver. I didn't find all of the chatacters to be 2-dimensional. The story presented a large, grey area in which you did have doubts as to who was a ""black hat"". This novel did encourage me to seek out others in the series, and I'm not generally a mystery fan."
5,"Desert Heat, book one of the Joanna Brady series",As with almost all J.A. Jance books I've read I enjoyed reading it very much. I would recommend reading Desert Heat first so you will know what has happened when you read the following books.
5,Desert Heat,"This was not the first book of JA Jance's I had read, I actually read a later one in the series first and have now gone back to the beginning and want to read all of her books (all series). She writes very well, with plenty of mystery and good storylines. My only problem is that the whole series is not available via kindle books."
5,Baby Mozart and Colic,"We were given this CD as a new baby gift from my boss. It was a hit with my newborn son, that was unfortunately blessed with colic. When he gets upset and is inconsolable with walking, rocking, hugging, and other techniques, we have found this CD to help him relax and fall asleep."
3,808 is not the dance/club remix,"Not a comment on the quality of the album. I bought this CD looking for the one song, 808, which is not available for download online anywhere that I could find. The version of 808 on this disk is slow and barely resembles the version I remember hearing on the radio back in '99-2000."
4,Blaque,"The teen pop trio Blaque has always been a mystery to me. This is their self-titled debut, which is pretty unpolished and slightly rough at the edges. It seems like the songs were randomly thrown together and put in any order. This album isn't dependable if you want something very meaningful that will change your life. But, if you want a couple high-energy tracks such as Roll With Me, 808, or I Do, then you've got it right here. There are also some pretty ballads, such as the ever-popular Time After Time, or the vocally powerful Stay By Your Side, or possibly the soft-toned Leny. But what happened to their second album, Blaque Out? It's not on Amazon, but it's on iTunes if you want to check it out. This album is pretty basic, but it's some good entertainment."
3,"Great singing voices,but no boom!!!","Tis is pretty good for Blaque's first CD, butthey need to think about creaing their ownsound next time. 808 and the remix is da bomb diggy!!!! But 1 song is not going to take 3 talented females vey far in today'smusic industry. I'm proud of the girls and their recent success, but next time they better bring da noise or they'll get drowned out by some other 1-hit wonder. Datz all I got ta say fa now. Peace,love & hairgrease!!"
3,average..too mainsrteam,I guess i'm partial to individual style. and ilike an artist that can be daring and do somthing like that. this group will make a little money though. beacause that sound is very popular these days
4,This is a great cd!!!,"I just love this cd !!! Not only does it have ""808"" and ""I Do"" but it has ""Bring it all to me"".I just love this song cuz with J.C.'s deep voice and Blaque's smooth harmonies you can't hate it!!!"
2,this is not what you expect,"this cd has to much rap. i thought it would be like tlc were in the no scrubs video there was rap except not on the cd. in i do from the Blaque cd they kept the ""can nobody tell me bordikin cus i be lovin my man wat i shood of said: if you like rap this cd is great. i expected an r&b cd"
2,Disappointing,"Okay, I didn't pay attention, but a head's up woulda' been nice: the ""808"" on the album is nothing like the ""808 (Remix) that's getting all the airplay. I was tricked/didn't pay attention. That said, ""Bring It All to Me"" really is the only worthwhile song on the album with it's positive vibe of women asking for more from a relationship than the usual skanky moneygrubbing songs out there. Otherwise, all the songs on the album need to be a lot more dance-oriented. Very boring."
4,A great CD,"I like these girls. They know how to make a pop song work, without putting a major sugar coating. Some of my favorites are ""Don't go looking for love"", ""808"", and ""I Do"". Of course ""Bring it all to me"" makes a great tune to hear during 4 o'clock traffic =). Blaque also does an excellent job on remaking the classic Cyndi Lauper song ""Time after time"". All an all, i must say this is a great CD with awesome harmony and decent lyrics."
3,"Funny little spoof shot I beleive with Bogart's own company,","(correct me if I'm wrong). Shot in Italy it appears on the cheap. Production wise it barely holds together. John Huston & Truman Capote directed & rewrote it on the fly. Bogie looks old as do his pals Peter Lorre & Robert Morley. He's past his leading man prime. Gina Lollabridga is not old as Bogart's sultry wife. Jennifer Jones is cute but annoying as Bogat's mistress. He has thrown in with a gang of losers in an ill-defined scheme to buy some land in Africa that contains uranium. They hava a long boat ride ahead of them. Ms Jones has a lot of pointless & boring dialogue. Things go awry. Without Bogie & Lorre this movie is nothing. So it's ok. The print I had from Maducy was as usual, terrible."
1,Very poor technical production,"This version (LaserLight) is awful. There is no effort to fix any of the scratches in the film, and a logo for ""Delta"" appears periodically in the lower right suggesting that this film was simply taped off the air and dumped on a DVD."
2,A waste of money,"Don't even bother purchasing this album. If you want to hear this band at their best, look around in record shops for their earlier work(early 80's) These albums were put out by Star records, and Other People's Music. I think that Star records has begun to re-release their earlier stuff,eg. In love with the system lp, Surfin on Heroin,and Pride and Disgrace lp. Stay away from their crappy sound of the late 80's and 90's, such as this album."
4,Interesting collection of demos,"The Sex Pistols' Mini Album is a pretty good collection of demos, recorded in July 1976. Most of these songs appear on Nevermind the Bollocks, but the versions of the songs here are different from the ones on the album in terms of sound: the guitars are cleaner, and Johnny Rotten's vocals aren't nearly as snotty or as abrasive as they were on Nevermind the Bollocks. ""Submission,"" ""Seventeen,"" ""Anarchy in the UK,"" and ""No Feelings"" are the songs from Bollocks included here. The other two songs are rare songs that are just as good: ""Satellite,"" with rather romantic (for punk) lyrics and more of a hard rock feel to it, while ""I Wanna Be Me"" has the attitude of the stuff they were legendary for, and gives a big middle finger to conformity and whatever was going on in music at the time. This is for diehard fans of the band, and punk rock worshippers essentially, but for a casual fan, it might not be as interesting as Bollocks was."
2,disappointing,"The premise was interesting,promising a mix of police detective/SiFi, one of my favorites. Unfortunately, the book's positive points ended with the premise. This one failed to hold my interest. I had trouble connecting and sympathizing with the heroine. The author also devoted a time consuming and rather boring amount of space attempting to prove a history of ""aliens among us"", using the heroine doing research as a vehicle. By the time the book ended, I found myself sitting thinking,""OK. What was the point?"" I won't be buying any further books by this author."
3,"and so, post music is born","dear kevin (Kevin is the mastermind behind of montreal): please sit down (in a room) and write a book of odd verse, chid-like stories and bitter sweet post-pop quirks; your story telling skills are a true marble, and your sense of the lovely is.. good good. then come back to us, and start writing again those pop hooks with late 60's production and dreamland tim burton meets the powerpuff girls lyrics;this album, unlike the oh-so-good gay parade, is a talking and singing book; no indie pop easy listening values here, folks; some tracks are unlistenable as songs, and some tracks fall into olivia tremor control-like noise interludes; if the gay parade was the neutral milk hotel for 4 year olds, this one is OTC, reading winnie the pooh in the lavatory. file under: odd experiment gone too book-like."
5,Putting the Satan back in Santa Monica!,"The best metal record in a decade. This album makes me want to drink soy milk and get in shape like Rocky. Fans of dokken, dio, napam death,cradle of filth,Pantera,Monster Magnet,Sepultura, Judas Priest,Dream Theater, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Megadeth,Yngwie Malmsteen, Kyuss, and Carcass take note; you are no longer relevant."
4,Unique & Facinating,"I found this book to be a unique and interesting story, but at times a difficult read. Harlan writes as though we ought to know some of the history, etc. of his characters, places, but this is the future of an ALTERNATE history. It's a facinating idea... what if the Aztec Empire had never fallen? What if they still ruled today and in the future? Combine that with a space adventure and what a great story. But Harlan stumbles over intricate wording and ideas causing the reader to question if Harlan himself really understands the world he has created and the story and action frequently grinds to a complete halt. An excellent book if you can get past some of the more akward areas."
1,Cure for insomnia,"Thank God I bought this book at a local used book store for only $0.50. I would hate to think I bought it new for $7.99. I am a fan of most alternate history, which is the main reason I purchased the novel. But you could take what little alternate history there is out of this book and still have your novel. The book dragged on and I have to admit that I know of no good reason why I completed reading it. Fortunately the book will not be wasted. I often donate books to the local library's Books for Soldiers program and this book will go to Iraq where one our our soldiers will use it to relax as there is nothing exciting in the book."
2,not water proof,"This item is not water proof in the least, a little rainy night on my way home from work and next day it was dead. Battery is a size I never seen before, cant find in stores. I gave a two because the lights worked find, the snap on system is sturdy - never fell off while ridding. I ended up going to my local bike shop and just saw a clip on light, bought it for a lot cheaper then this one and yes it is water proof."
3,"UNspectacular, but...","Nothing on here you really haven't heard before, except it has a gem of a song that's overlooked by many fans.""If You Have the Time"" has forgettable lyrics and vocals, but its keyboard/synth track is fantastic, and the CD version really brings that out."
4,An A for Angela!,"Lansbury stars in this show with Beatrice Arthur. The music is show-stopping and ""Mame"" deserves a huge applause."
3,Clinical and More Useful for the Beginning DNA Tech,I wanted a replacement for the DNA books loaned and not returned. The subject was not a good substitute. Easy to read in places; too much of a lab book. Good for a DNA student tech. Will not replace Watson and Crick for the double helix curious.
3,Out of this world.,"You think you know the universe? Think again! This book will tell you all there is to know about the big bang, planets, stars, universe, dwarf planets, black holes, solar energy, etc. I find this subject fascinating, but it takes a focus mind to take it seriously. There is so much the naked eye can't see all around us and this book is an eye opener regarding celestial bodies."
1,Terrible quality,"I bought these, and tried to use the two smallest in a Jeep windshield. Both sheared off on the first attempt to use... Would not buy!"
5,This album is for the lovers of cool swing!,I have enjoyed listening to this album! All I wanted was nothing but fat swing from the main man Thelonius Monk! I recommend this album to jazz listeners everywhere!
1,Nicon Semi-Soft Case,Not what I expected. Case has to be removed before the camera can be used. The case is just about large enough to fit the body and an 18mm-55mm lens-larger lenses won't fit. There are no external or internal pockets for extra SD cards or batteries. Not even well padded. Big price for a useless product.
4,MBA in a nutshell,This book does a great job of explaining what an MBA is going to do for you. It summarizes first year curriculum in an easy to understand format. It also could be used as a pocket guide for defining your business. A great weekend read.
2,El Cheapo,"I realize this product was only 20 some dollars verses 30 & 40 for the others...... I wish I would spent the extra! The plastic tabs on the face cover broke off before I even had the deck in it! Buyer beware, very cheap and very cheap!! Also the wire colors don't male since, they are not the right colors!"
1,Cheap,You get what you pay for. The door hinges broke clean off after just a few uses. I had to install very small hinges to be able to use it.
2,Not enough wires..,The case itself is nice but the wires that are molded in there are is not enough. It has a power and a ground and of corse the speaker wires for 4. It needs a acc and a remote. Had to drill holes to make it work.
2,Poor Quality,"I ordered this stereo enclosure to put in my boat. The first thing that I noted was that the wires that it has in it are very thin...I think I used the 18 slot on my strippers. Second problem was that when I got it all wired up and started to mount it to my boat, the female side of the housing, where the screw goes, caved in very easily. This not only make it no 'weather proof', but also impossible to mount. I ended up super gluing it back together and very carefully mounting it. Overall it was a huge headache."
1,Should not have been released as a Blu-ray!,"Have been waiting for this Jerry Lewis goodie ever since the dawn of DVD. This is probably one of the best Jerry Lewis movies ever. Fast, funny and completely insane.But what a horrible Blu-ray it is! Some few scenes (or rather shots) look just as good as the recently released Blu-rays of The Geisha Boy, Rock-a-Bye Baby and Boeing Boeing, but 95% of the time the image here is super-soft, fuzzy and far, far away from fresh Technicolor. Incredibly sad. Olive Films should not have accepted this HD master from Paramount, and if it really represents the best that could be found in the vaults (which I doubt), then a DVD release only had been a better decision. This ugly-looking crap of an image does not deserve a transfer to Blu-ray. It will only give this superior format a bad name among those who do not know better. Olive Films should be more careful about their products - and reputation."
4,"Great, less-mainstream '60s rock sound","Great roots of hard rock! The style is less pop than the Beatles, but still strongly mid-sixties. Gotta love that fuzz guitar and dark atmospere. My favorite is ""Evil Hearted You."" As suggested by the cover, the guitar playing is mostly Jeff Beck, followed by Eric Clapton. I'm not sure there's any Jimmy Page. Check it out!"
1,Worst sound quality record I own,"This vinyl is honestly the worst audio quality in my entire collection. The sound is muffled, the instruments sound quite, and the the overall quality is poor. This LP is now relegated to background noise around my house. Its labeled as an original master audio recording, I just dont know what went wrong. Maybe my copy is defective."
1,Not such good service.,I am titling my opinion as not such good service because of the fact when I had purchased this CD it was suppose to come in the mail as a CD and it had come as a record . And I had no idea on how to return when my niece had opened it and all so I was just wondering what to do? Penny Greenman
5,I'm on my 4th book in the brotherhood series...can't put them down.,"My friend suggested this series to me...an outstanding suggestion. I can't put them down. I love the romantic supernatural experience and this one is no exception. All these men are flawed and deadly but for some reason I love the whole bunch of them. Once again the women and children are protected above all...and the weak human falls into that classification often. I highly recomend this series...some sex, lots of battles, deadly villains and really three dementional characters. Bravo to J.R. Ward."
5,Great Book,This is by the far the best series of Vampire Novels. Beware you will not be able to put the book down once you start reading. The action is intense and the love scenes put any other vampire books to shame.
3,Not bad,"I read the series over the Christmas break which is our summer holidays. Not a bad read, very light reading, just what you need when on a break."
5,PERFECT!,Oh I loved Mary and Rhage's story!I almost cried at the end with what the Scribe Virgin tells M&R; about her gift.I'm looking forward to reading about the rest of the brothers.This series has so many possibilities!
4,"Despite the convenient ending, I loved it.","I appreciated her 'plain' human with a very human disease as the heroine. I also love Rhage. The ending was a little annoying, but it didn't effect my love for this series. J.R. Ward is definitely one of a kind."
5,What a love story..,"He looks like a fallen angel, she's less than perfect. He falls for her - she's dying. Such a hard story to get through - however it does have a happy ending folks it's just the getting there that's tough. It's been mentioned elsewhere that the hero has 'relations' with someone else while he is with the heroine. This is somewhat true but the story needs to be read to understand his position and it make sense. J.R. Ward is an automatic buy for me and what makes it even better is her discussion forum (get there through her website) which has some very lively discussions on the books and upcoming releases. awesome. Highly recommend this author."
3,"Love the story, not the narrator.","I read the book and was excited to see that this book was in audio. Once I got it and heard it...I was a bit disappointed with Jim Frangione narrating. He has a monotonous voice. Has no emotion to the story....it's all in one tone. If you haven't read the book and you hear this, you would think it's just one character and not a story of 2 people who are in love and struggling to be together. I have other audio books and the girl who reads them has a great voice and she plays out the characters of the book. I'm sorry, but if I had known it was going to sound like this I wouldn't of gotten it. I wish they would redo this story with Hillary Huber reading it, she has more style and charisma on making the story believable.I would really think twice on getting this audio, but if you love the story as much as I do, then you could probably get thru this with Jim Frangione speaking.I do hope this has helped if your considering getting this audio.CarolBoston, MA."
5,Fantastic Read! I couldn't put it down.,"September is too far away! For weeks I've been bugging and haunting my favorite bookstore asking if Book 2 had already arrived. I picked it up last Tuesday and planned to read the book this weekend as a treat to myself. I held out for 1 day. I finished the book this morning in one sitting. I am soo hooked!If you thought that Dark Lover was good. Lover Eternal only gets better!I loved how JR Ward brings a funky, hard core and hip edge to these characters. And what's even better is how she fleshes out the ""supporting cast"" (Tohr, Zsadist, V, Butch, etc.) She manages to make everyone 3-dimensional, without sacrificing or rushing the storyline. And boy! what a story it was! Wow!"
2,Non-ascending Venus,"After three outings that were fun, although a bit off-the-wall, this fourth effort is rather a total loss. Briefly put, Venus Diamond is on a case again, although she gets into it indirectly. The Greedy are seeking to profit from the Protectors of near-extinct wildlife. The Moralists and the Environmentalists are in there, too.There were too many plot elements to keep track of; too many subplots that do little to advance the major thread; too many ""just-in-time-and-place"" resolutions of sticky issues.Of course, everything gets more-or-less resolved by the last page, but one can hope that Venus' next outing will be more grounded and less contrived."
1,Like a Statistics Textbook from Hell,"This book might be of use to someone who's interested in all of the math behind reliability estimation, but it's of little practical use to anyone who doesn't have a year to study it. It's full of little gems like: ""This [equation] can be used to parametrically adjust the nonparametric estimate of probability plot shown in..."". You get equation after equation with no explicit way to get from the abstract math to the plots and conclusions you really need.Not for anyone who needs a quick, practical guide to reliability analysis."
2,Not very useful in practice,"The purpose of this book was supposed to serve very broad groups of people: students, statisticians and engineers. Unfortunately, I found this book not quite suitable in engineering practice.From practical point of view, when dealing with reliability estimations, one has to connect mathematical theory with real-life data. It appears that to accomplish this task it is necessary to understand some basic statistical ideas, plus specifics of the subject under consideration. Sometimes common sense knowledge can come in handy. Strangely enough but many fundamental principles are in fact surprisingly simple, elegant and thus beautiful. What is missing in the book is the lack of clear explanations of fundamental statistical concepts that certainly can be presented in a complicated form but in reality they are not. On the other side, the book could serve as a solid textbook to students, statisticians and mathematicians."
4,Nice product,"Easy to install, love the high and low light setting. Glass lenses will last forever and will not discolor. fyi. High light setting will produce a bit of heat."
1,An Unexciting Potporri on Origins and Uses of Coffee,"After reading books on this subject by Thorn and Kummer it was a real disappointment to me to find that this so-called ""ultimate guide"" fell far short. If your interest lies more in the way coffee is served and consumed here and in other countries this may hold your interest. (The author's dissertation on U.S.practices manages somehow, even there, to omit any references to the influence of the key people at Peets, Starbucks, and Allegro, for example.) It is far too shallow for my taste in the areas of coffee selection by type and location (pros and cons) and blending techniques."
5,Harlequin romantic suspense,"Quick reading mystery romance set in Creole country. Strong and intricate characters like those in Tami Hoag, Nora Roberts, and Brandy Carter novels.Cover: ""Blood is thicker than water.... Or so they say. But when blood ties are bound by a tragic past, unraveling them can be deadly. Hired to find a client's birth mother, New Orleans P.I. Patrice Ribeau discovered more than smalltown scandal behind the Spanish moss and bayou mist of Port Latanier, Louisiana. There was danger lurking there, and somebody who would stop at nothing---not even voodoo---to bring Patrice's search to an untimely end. Her one hope in solving the case lay with Alan Lowndes. But behind his captivating gaze and soothing voice, Patrice knew he kept secrets of his own. And with the way he made her feel, she had to wonder if she was in over her head."""
5,Great Fun Film,"We saw this at the Wisconsin Film festival and have been looking for it on dvd. Buying it today because this is a great flick. You do not have to be a metal head to enjoy this, although you will obviously appreciate it all the more if you are. This film has great humor, history, and hits you in the head with an iron fist. Sam is an anthropoligist and took his skills to his passion for metal and explored the depths for all to share in. I'm a die hard metal head and went with my wife and a few friends - one of which is not into metal at all - and we all thought it was great and talked about it for hours and still qoute it today. Rock on Sam!"
5,His best yet!!,"I believe this album is his best work to date, due to the fact that so much has changed in his life in the past couple of years and it is really reflected with the songs on here. There's not an artist in country music who can match Joe's vocal ablilties on ""Better Off Gone"" and ""I'm The Only Thing I'll Hold Against You."" For those fans who are into music with substance, this is a wonderful album."
4,"No nonsense, practical guide to surfing the multi-channel whirlwind","Geoff Webb's style is something of a shock to the system. That is if you are used to somewhat more conventional business books. I'm not sure why it's so different but I found it challenging to adapt my reading style to his writing style. But once I got into the swing of it I found the book full of insight.Geoff clearly has a firm opinion about the Internet and how many organisations are simply not in tune with this unique delivery system. He is blunt and to the point, I like it! ""If you are still running your own call center I suggest that you go for psychotherapy"" is a classic quote and pretty typical of what you will read.Having said all of that, the book lays out a compelling proposition and gives some clear advice on how best to harness that thing called 'multi-channel marketing'. If you are struggling to understand how to meet the multi-channel challenge I'm sure you'll find guidance and practical advice on how to proceed."
5,FIFA 2003,"Probably my most favourite FIFA game because it is simple to set-up and play right away. I also own FIFA 2010 - it is a great game that looks realistic because of the awesome graphics but set-up takes too much time. If you're looking for a soccer game for quick play, FIFA 2003 is highly recommended."
3,Okay,I don't think it is as good as Fifa World Cup 2002. It graphics are better but 2002 game play is a lot better. My friend all think 2002 is better. This game's good but 2002 is a lot better.
1,2002 FIFA World Cup Edition is Better,I got FIFA 2003 because I really loved the 2002 FIFA World Cup Edition. When I first played FIFA 2003 I thought it was ok and as I started playing it more it got worse. You can't turn well and every time I've done an aggressive slide tackle and hit the player I've gotton a yellow card. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup Edition you can make the ref as tense or as loose as you want. IF you're going to buy a soccer game I reccomend getting the 2002 FIFA World Cup Edition because it's better and it costs less money.
3,This Game Is Alright,The GamePlay And The Reffing Is Way Off. You Cant Win Balls In The Air. You cant pass Backwards without Taking 10 Minuets. And It [is bad] Bigtime That you Cant Create or edit players or leagues.However It Is Great that there is no limit to howmany trades you can do there for it is easy for you to update the rosters. I think The tournaments are cool. but I Hate how off the national teams are Example: German National Team Doesent Have Kahn And The Brazilien National Doesent Have Ronaldo Those Were only The 2 Best Players In The World Cup
4,How Consistent is this?,PLOT SPOILER: I have much concern that the character Spenser would sit nearly while someone he supposedly cares about would commit suicide. Is this consistent with the character?
1,Wanda Sykes is NOT funny...At ALL,The same washed out over played gay stuff that was funny 30 years ago when comedians first started breaking open the door. Her delivery is awkward and she is just not funny. Hoping for more laughs.
5,OMG....non stop funny!!!,This is one of the funniest stand up acts I have ever seen. Wanda covers everything from Obama to having kids and makes them all hysterical. Highly recommend...I've watched it over and over and it never gets old. Prepare to get an ab workout from laughing!!
2,Average,"This product is frustrating! It has a number of bugs and wasted my study time as I had to keep fixing my labs. It also crashes heaps. I'm happy I didn't pay for it and work did. It's ok for a basic tool, but I would keep looking. I'm at the point now where I'm looking to buy another product. I don't recommend it!"
3,Pretty good for 7 bucks,"These rails are pretty good. They are not tapered so mounting a flashlight would cause the light to point more above your target. Also, they don't space correctly when installing on a M&P 15 hand guard. They fit extremely loose and need washers to space the nuts for tightness. And they can be very crooked if you aren't careful on installation. Other than that, they do what they say and are a good cheap choice for mounting a bipod on a standard hand guard. They are made of sturdy metal too, which is a plus."
1,Not As Pictured,Be warned the ones you will get are not the ones pictured. The pictured ones have 12 slots and 6 holes. The ones you get have 7 slots and 3 holes. They are shorter than pictures---for some applications this matters. What you see is what you SHOULD get---anything else is a deceptive practice.
2,Rail Set,"Once again, thephoto descriptin shows the rails and Hand Gurad for Ar 15. It does not include the hand guards, and does not include the proper amount of screws to place the rails onto the standard AR 15 guards. Be ready to go to the local hardware stoe to purchase more screws."
2,Not very good,I bought this expecting it to be able to hold my flashlight and my grip by was very disappointed when I got it. They were very small and would slide around no matter how tight you made them. They were so small it would barely hold my grip!They were also packaged in a white plastic bag and then individually packed in another plastic bag. The only good thing is they are metal but how much can you expect for 5 dollars.
2,bronson 3pack dvd,"well, one can obviously not expect very much given the price paid for this dvd but at least cold sweat appears in widescreen format and has somewhat of a better picture quality than a previously owned dvd of mine. but unfortunately the other 2 movies are quite poor in picture and sound quality. the previous viewer pretty much described the movies' contents. hopefully, in the future, some other earlier titles of bronson will be available specifically riders on the rain."
3,It's all right......,"This game is all right. It has all-stars from 1950 up till now, but even in Rookie mode, the computer always makes 3 pointers and you almost can't. There is one on one (nba player against nba player, like a hussle)mode, season, franchise, and normal games and practices. Also, you can't steal much. Everytime you try to steal, you get fouls. That's why I gave 3 stars."
3,If it starts cold it stays cold,"Works great at keeping cans cold, but not for several hours, no way, maybe 30 minutes or so. But who keeps a can full that long anyway. Will cool down a warm can (room temp), but not make it cold. I like mine, but use it on cans right from the fridge to keep them cold."
5,Same product that has been used for years,"We have had this item in the house for a whole lot of years. At least one is used on a daily basis and it has always performed as expected. Over the years, the sleeve has been punctured and the cooling gel was lost. Thus the reason for seeking out this replacement."
1,Disappointed,"I couldn't wait to get these can chillers, but my experience with them has been a real disappointment. They probably are as good as an ordinary can cover, but certainly nothing more. How do different people have such different results from products?, where some are just delighted and others have poor results?"
5,Never have a warm end to your BEER again !!!,"How many times have you cleaned up after the party to find beer cans that had 1/4 of the Beer left in the can ??? Oh, No! That's alcohol ABUSE !!! I have a few of these and all you have to do is when you finish your ice cold beverage, toss this item back in the freezer and grab another cold one for your next BEER!! Wahooo!! Best invention since sliced bread !! :)"
4,can chillers,i like this product because they keep items cold. they kids can take them to school and i can keep my beverage cold.
5,BEAUTIFUL ALBUM,"a slight departure from Acoustic Soul, but displays growth & artistry. Very inspirational & uplifting"
5,Voyage to India Delivers and I Receive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This album really surpriced me coming from a secular artist. I admire the soul connectin that is clearly felt in her music. I liked this CD so much that I gave it to a teenage female friend of mine. It's a coming of age CD with wisdom written all over it and I know she'll appreciate it. Its the(older) women teaching the younger women. I appreciate her wisdom and boldness to speak it!
5,What A Nice Surprise! A Must Have!,"When I saw India Arie in concert this summer, I thought for sure I would NEVER buy her CDs! After hearing a couple of tracks on the radio which I really like I decided to give her a try. I must say Voyage to India is the Bomb! I love her messages, the arrangement, music, and everything! I'm definitely feeling her on all tracks! She speaks the truth!"
4,Feel Good Music!,"Voyage to India is very upbeat and is a breath of fresh air. Songs like Slow Down, Simple Things and God is Real help you to remember that life is a journey to be enjoyed. The Truth and Beautiful are great love songs that prove that love can be expressed without being explicit. If you enjoyed India's Acoustic Soul than you will enjoy the Voyage that India takes you on this time. Out of the 15 tracks on the CD, I only bypass the Intro (#1) and one other one."
4,format swap?,"I haven't investigated but I suspect that West Wing makers have been seduced by the dubious advantages of HD. Compared to earlier seasons the lighting seems by turns either harsh with massivley blown highlights or mushy and soft. I am a DoP and I have heard rumours that the West Wing sets and lighting rig were retained without being adjusted for the inferior output of HD compared to that of Super35mm. It's a shame if it has gone down this route as one of the great positives for TV is the high quality offered by US mutliseasonal dramas like; Carnivale, 24, Wired etc if this quality is to be dumped for a bean-counting production excersise then we are all the poorer.On a purely non technical level WW6 won't disappoint it retains all the pulling power & punch of previous seasons and is emminently watchable."
4,Less substance than potential; insensitive cut of english subtitles,"I have hearing problems and up until now, I've been very happy that the DVDs for my favorite show, The West Wing, have always had quality english subtitles. The DVDs for this season, however, did not have that feature, even though they were mentioned in the product description when I purchased the set.Aside from that, the quality of this show decreased significantly after Aaron Sorkin left and the writer pretty much changed each episode, leaving the season disjointed and the feeling of each episode different from the one preceeding and succeeding it.That said, it's still The West Wing and it's better than most of the stuff on TV now or that was on when it was running."
5,Season Six,"We have not watched any of the episodes yet, but we never missed West Wing when it was on tv. We have all 5 of the previous seasons, and have watched all of them at least once. I know we will be watching Season Six over the summer while nothing of interest is on tv. We can't wait for season 7 to be released, to complete our set."
4,Season six back on track,Season 5 was a bit of a disappointment after 1-4.Season 6 gets back on track.Fans of WW will enjoy it.
2,No more English subtitles,Suddenly dropping the English subtitles after the 5th season is a terrible thing to do to viewers who depended on them. The rapidfire dialogue with no subtitles makes the 6th season almost unwatchable by viewers who can't hear well. Very disappointing.
5,"Excellent, new condition.","The product was received timely, in new condition, and for the amount agreed upon. No problems."
2,Going Downhill Fast,"I own and loved West Wing until... Season 6 and 7 was no longer witty, intelligent, funny etc. I was surprised that Season 6 was not canceled half the way through. The only reason I watched towards the end was because I watched since the start. I only give it 2 stars because I care for the actors. Was not their fault they had bad writers."
2,Getting tiresome,I have been an avid watcher of all seasons. This one just missed the WOW or grab you in appeal. I don't think I will be watching it anymore after the sixth season going even further downhill.Only outstanding reviews could convince me to watch season 7
5,Government the way it should be!!,I am a huge fan of the West Wing and just started to watch the series again. I realize that this is just a TV show but I think we all could use an intelligent President and righteous staff. Is it too much to ask for? I watch this show and have hope.
4,Better Than Season #5,"I took me a while to get through Season 4. Too much soap, no issues and no real excitement. This season, focusing mostly on primaries for the next presidency, is much better. Newcomers Smits and Alda are great additions, but it's too bad there's less of Leo, Charly and Donna."
3,Season 6 DVD's,"I have a deep love for the West Wing and will continue to watch it no matter the quality of the episodes. This season takes us out of the West Wing and on the campaign trail, which was interesting. However, my main reason for giving it 3 stars is because it doesn't have english subtitles and the extras are not all that great. I think there should have been a bit more invested in the overall package, not just taking the episodes and putting them on DVD's."
2,not as pictured,"I thought I would be receiving the filter and the three special bolts to mount the cover as pictured, but it is the filter only, leaving me with having to try and track down the parts to install it. If there is anything I can't stand, it's a misleading ad."
4,Great Stuff,"you gotta check out the CKY box set, It is worth the cash although the documentary is kinda lame. It provides hours of entertainment. These guys had a part in the hit TV show Jackass on MTV. I also recommend the hard to find Sickening Conceptions DVD if you are into this type of humor."
3,suffers from soundtrack-itis,"As a soundtrack, this is brilliant work. However, as a pure source of listening, the the music just doesn't flow very gracefully without the very clever plot of the movie. The elements that made such a fascinating story, the journey of the violin through time and around the world, make for a listening experience that lacks cohesion and appears disjointed. This is in spite of unbelievable execution and artistry. My recommendation is that you go for the whole experience and buy the movie instead. If you have seen it, another movie soundtrack with these characteristics is 'music from siesta' by miles davis."
2,Music is best along with the movie,"There are soundtracks that are wonderful to listen to without the movie, such as Ladies in Lavender, and there are soundtracks that go very well while watching the movie. The Red Violin is not as pleasing without the film. With having said that, Joshua Bell does deserve compliments for his excellent skill."
5,You won't need your Zoloff today if you read this,"I loved this book. If you ever lived in small town America, you will love this book. It takes you back to what happens in small towns and close families. It will take you back to family gatherings and childhood misconceptions. I would recommend this book to anyone needing a good laugh. The chapters are short enough to read while waiting for ballet and soccer practice to be over. Keep writing Susan, I'll keep reading."
1,Awful!,"Now I'm not one to not read a book in it's entirity, but this book was just to painful to read. 5 stars? Hilarious? Not so much. I purchased this on my Kindle and it was such a waste of money. If you decide you want to give it a go, I suggest going to your nearest library and doing so for free (you'll thank me later!)"
1,Unexpected,"I was expecting this book to have a plot so was disappointed that it was several short stories about the author's experiences, each 2 or 3 pages long."
5,Good Grease. cheaper elsewhere!,"Well, to elaborate on the other reviewers post, standard grease, works fine so far. nothing special.standard grease, works fine so far. nothing special.standard grease, works fine so far. nothing special.....uhhhmmm...ACTUALLY, much better than 'standard' grease due to it's ability to stay in place longer and not wash out like the cheap stuff.THAT being said, if you have an Advance Auto parts store around your area, you can get this for 5.99."
2,Behind Enemy Lines,Movie was good but I wanted to watch in HD streaming from Amazon and the movie stopped 6-8 times to buffer and load. Watched on my vizio with internet plugged into TV. Won't pay for HD again!
4,Apollo 8: Christmas at the Moon,"I just viewed this program on our local PBS station, and it was phenomenal. The 40th anniversary broadcast on the eve of Christmas took me back to the days of turmoil of 1968 and the huge pride of accomplishment it gave the USA in the final days of the year. The program includes interviews from the retired astronauts and other prominent people involved with the mission. I was stunned to learn that a lot of the mission staff average age was 25. The multiple angle camera shots of the liftoff are especially moving with the earth shaking roar of that Saturn 5 rocket. This was the first time mankind left the earth, and the resulting religious impact it had on The Apollo 8 crew - Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders looking back and seeing the earth growing smaller and smaller as they sped away toward the moon. The resulting unplanned photo of earth rise gave us all the impact of how precious our little planet is."
3,"Well-researched, colorful, entertaining, but predictable","The author has done an good job in researching for the book. She brings out the flavor of 1500's India vividly, a world of clashing cultures clamoring for a piece of the action. I know of few other recent novels set in the India of this time period and any history buff would find the book absorbing. But that's where the good stuff ends. The plot is Rider Haggard all over again."
4,The first true LA hardcore release. Reagan's In blisters!,"The rating drops because of Get Out Of My Yard-it's not bad, but Reagan's In is the reason to get this CD. I love Danny's vocals, but the git work of Chett and Allen's skins do it for me. These guys were tight."
5,Excellent TV,"This 32"" LCD by Sony is more expensive, but after comparing picture quality side by side with other LCD TV's, I decided to stay with a quality Sony product. This TV is rated #1 by Consumer Reports. I have DirectTV and using regular co-axial connection. The picture quality is excellent and I'm wondering if I need to upgrade to a DirecTV HD system. I plan to upgrade soon to get the full benefits of what this TV is capable of. Hook up was well documented for AV system, DVD player and VCR, when you read the directions. Remote is confusing at first. Watching movies from DVD player is great. Over all a great product."
3,"OK, but expensive",This is a pretty good introduction to the Losing Trick Count. And extensive enough for you to start using it.But almost $9 for a small booklet of 30 very small pages (the smallest with only 11 lines of text) is pretty much.
3,Berlioz en blanco y negro,"Obviamente que en Berlioz, Otto Klemperer no está en su campo. Hace una lectura fría de la partitura y sin todo el color que requiere esta obra. Es un disco interesante para los seguidores de este gran Maestro, pero para aquellos que simplemente están buscando al Sr. Berlioz, compren Herbert Von Karajan (DGG) ó Sir Georg Solti (DECCA)."
3,Cheap Game,"My friend and I play this game a lot and like the game. However, there are some falty areas. First, the field goal percentage is ridiculous because you can make a shot from almost anywhere. Second, The players feet sometimes sink into the wooden floor. Third, players can fly as high as 15 feet. Fourth, if you take a shot after the buzzer sounds, and the ball clips the net but doesn't go in, it is considered in. Fifth, if you go in for a Shaq dunk, the ball sometimes goes in but is not considered a basket. Overall, rent this game if you have to."
4,Awsome game............,"Nba Live 2003 is the most best nba game there is,but if you played Nba 2K3 this game might not be the best."
4,Best to date.,"I had given up on the NBA Live line, but this game has renewed my faith. They should give you more options on how to run your franchise. The graphics and gameplay are phenomenal compared to the other NBA Live games and the best thing is now they have ROOKIES! It still needs a little work to catch the NBA 2K series on Dreamcast. Overall, this is an excellent PS2 game for basketball fanatics."
2,This game is not good,"NBA Live was a great title while it was on the Sega Genesis, but with the PS2 and Xbox and G-Cube, EA Sports has lost their minds. In all the Lives they have made over the years no matter the system, old or new, they have used the same engine for all the Live titles. This takes away from what the Live series could be. NBA2K2 and hopefully 2K3 will continue to bring realistic gameplay along with graphics and controls. I urged anyone reading this to play Sega Sports NBA2k from any year 1,2 or the original, and then play NBA Live2003 or 2002 and I will guarantee that you will disown Live and fall in love with any of the NBA2k's. Better graphics, control, and gameplay makes the 2K series surpass anything EA Sports has done for basketball video games."
3,Inventing the Rest of Our Lives,"Book was an easy read and addressed some personal issues for me, but didn't really help me solve the issues and I am experiencing at 55. I am reinventing my life, but didn't find this book as helpful as I had hoped it would be."
2,"Truely a lame film, but I actually wouldn't mind seeing it again","I can't remembe quite why I bought this film, probably it was cheap, but I did. It is pretty rubbish. The plot is atrocious, but it does actually have a couple of funny moments in it. I haven't watched this film for about 9 years ago, it has been thrown out for at least 8.5 of those. However, now i wouldn't actually mind watching the thing again. I wouldn't actually devise anyone to watch this film but it deserves more than one star, althought not much more."
2,too much hassle,"I ordered this mixer thinking there was no way I wouldn't like it, it's a KitchenAid after all, they're the best, right? After the first couple of uses it became evident that this is not meant for regular-sized batches of cookies or cake; it is simply too big for household use. The orbital beaters don't reach the bottom of the bowl so it is necessary to frequently stop the mixer, lower the bowl, remove the shield & spout, scrape with a spatula, raise the bowl, replace the shield and spout, and turn it back on. What a hassle! The only plus in my opinion is the all-metal construction. I sold mine on Craigslist and my next mixer will be a traditional two-beater type, metal or not. Forget KitchenAid."
2,Waterproof speakers,I could not even figure out how to make this work properly. It didn't fit either of the ipods that my husband or i have. So it just went into a pile for a yard sale.
2,"Powerful, but",It has a lot of power and I don't mind that it sounds like a vacuum. I had my water very hot expecting it to cool down because of the air circulation. The air felt like needles because it was cooler than the water. Hotter is not better.
1,useless,"Easily the most useless purchase I ever made. The authors thoughts are random and dispersed. The book is not organized as a troubleshooting guide. It does not provide symptoms and flowcharts for determining the cause. At best it is an incomplete, brief, overview of television basics, with a couple of reminiscences of the authors experiences with tv repair. If the paper were recycled, the book would be worth .00023 cents."
3,Great When It Works,"We have had the Duo ice cream maker for about a month now. We have made four two-batches. One side works just great (the single batch side). The other side is questionable; we have to run it through one time, re-freeze the bowl, and then run the ice cream mixture through a second time on the single batch side. Within 20 minutes of the second run, the ice cream is of the proper consistency. Wish I could figure this one out. To say that we are disappointed is to put it mildly. When it works, we are very pleased with the end product. But we want two different flavors . . ."
2,I really really wanted to like this CD.,"I had high hopes for this CD. I was under the impression it was fast, catchy punk. Well, it's not. The songs on here are played very slowly and only 1 or 2 of them are catchy. If you are expecting somthing like the MISFITS, you will be dissipointed. However, if you are going to get an Agent Orange CD, by all means get LIVING IN DARKNESS because, it has the song BLOODSTAINS on it and that song rules!"
1,Powerful and strong scent...,"The bottle is beautiful, unfortunately the scent doesn't work well with my chemistry at all. It's very strong and gave me not only a headache, but also nausea. I'm glad I just bought a mini to try out and I will keep it because of the exquisite bottle, but I'll never wear this scent."
2,Don't get the audio version!,"I like Spenser books - the good and not so good, and I love audiobooks as they eliminate commuting driving stress / road rage. But this one made me angry because Windom's reading is REALLY bad! You can't tell one character from another in dialogues. Windom has odd inflection, particularly at the ends of sentences. And he sounds like he's sucking in his last breath with each phrase. Mr. WIndom, find another line of work, please!"
2,The time has come to dump Susan,"I have read all the Spenser books until now, but unless Susan goes, I may not read the next one. I would trade 10 Susans for one Hawk."
3,"wow, what a sensitive guy","the perversity of relationships is beyond belief, and well illustrated in sudden mischief. how does one sense a liar? and if you discover your loved one is lying to you in word and deed, how long do you resist facing up to it? the culprit's decision to repeat past behavior even though it has stopped working for him is a classic study of our psychological weaknesses. spenser and hawk are my dream mates - intuitive, sensitive, and they can beat the crap out of anybody who gives me a hard time. must be like having the hulk as your best friend, only he likes to drink & smoke, & doesn't go through so many clothes."
4,Aging Spencer is back with a vengence. A delightful read.,"Spencer is back, in all his aging glory. This book did not disappoint. As with all spencer books, the engaging repartee' was delightful. Want to know what happens to p.i.'s when they get older? Do they just fade away? Not this guy. Hawk appears deeper, yet!"
3,No room in the end!,"I see that I am not the only person becoming more and more dissappointed with the Spenser books. Spenser has contradicted himself in this latest stab in the series. There was no climax to this book. The boy scout Spenser allows Susan's ex to just simply run off when he has brutually murdered two people, one being a woman with the excuse of ""they will catch up to him soon"". For Spenser, who has just about always portrayed that ""someone has got to pay"", dissappointing doesn't come close to describing this debacle. I had been put off with the book from the first two or three pages and it didn't get much better throughout. But the end, there is no room for such crap!"
4,like it!,Very good! Exactly what I wanted. It's just that I think I like Daisy more. I love my fancy perfumes though c:Thank you!
5,Good series,This book is part of a series of books. Excellent reading about life and friendship among quilters. The whole series has been great.
1,Film making is not a sport.,"This author should stick to Sports Illustrated or switch to Mad magazine. His style is that of a gossiping school girl. It would have been an interesting project for an author that has studied film or knew what he was writting about. How can someone write on a topic that they do not know? Bamberger, you risked your so called ""career"" on a topic that you obviously did not do your homework on. The next time you meet a celebrity at a party they will think twice when asked by you to follow them around for a year."
1,A $27.50 edition of People Magazine,"You can tell that this author had never been on a film set before. He seemed completely starstruck and that may have skewed his reality. I could barely get through the book, it was like reading a tabloid magazine. He exposed Night to great criticism by offering his naive opinions. Mr. Bamberger should stick to a subject that he knows about. He already hurt the reputation of a young female golfer, he should be careful not to attack the integrety of others. If we judged his writing abilities the way he judged filmmaking his career could suffer."
3,"readable but, not as clever as next in sequel","As a long time romance reader after awhile you just need to take a break because they all start sounding alike ...for the most part.....then the itch for a good romance comes around and I start looking for something that will flat out hold my attention until the last page. I think that this book had alot of potential but, never built the chemistry enough to really ignite the pages...I enjoy alot of whitty conversation and sizzling intimate situations.....but without the chemistry its just sex......if you would like a perfect example of a Regency romance that will knock your socks off try ""Whitney my Love"" by Judith McNaught....now this is what I call true romance...the way we all dream of being knocked off our feet....sorry, back to this book....While I enjoyed it and recommend it as a good summer read the next book in the sequel was much better....and I am looking forward to the last book in the series..."
4,Entertaining Regency,"As others have pointed out, there is little new or fresh in the story line department. However, the main characters are very likable. Also, it was refreshing for me to read a romance with a heroine that wasn't so annoying with haughtiness or excessive game playing. She played it pretty straight and for that I am interested in continuing with the series."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this heater to heat up my bedroom. We have weak central heat in my house, and this was just supposed to be a supplement.I had the thing on for about two hours and hardly noticied a difference in the chill of the room.I think the problem is that the heat only comes out the top of the heater and there is no fan to circulate it.In addition, it is very heavy and consequently difficult to move around espescially for a space heater."
1,An unhappy customer,"Three days ago I purchased a Delonghi oil heater, model # EW0507,type H050715P, 1500W, 120V. The heater continuously trips the circuit in the area where it is pluged. This unit does not have the timer and puts out little heat. I am afraid to plug it in again. My house is only nine years old. I also have other heaters that I use periodicallly without problems. Unfortunately, there is no place in metro-Atlanta to take this unit."
1,Sir Finz,"I just took this item in for repair, est repair cost: $[money]!! I have only used it seven times and now it's useless. Broken floor switch, blown motor, rusted bearings and no spray. What a waste of my money..save yours."
5,durable organizer,both of my kids have a LeapPad and several books ... this is a great way to keep them all together. It's durable and kid friendly--so they can keep track of their cartridges and books ... and it's great b/c they can just grab it and go which makes it nice for travel too.
4,Stage Diving to the oldies,"This is a good CD for a few classic punk rock songs. Not every single song is good, one or two suck, but overall its good. Its almost got the exact same songs as on Old School Punk, a couple of the songs are different, but for the most part, they're the same. Anyway, point is, its a good CD, I enjoy it, brings back lots of memories"
5,Reminiscent of Graham Greene,"It's too bad more people havn't read this..it's funny, accessible, and a joy to read while at the same time being intelligent. Saccochis has a great sense of humor...I think he's one of the best writers around."
4,1st Installment in a Trilogy?,"I'm a big Shacochis fan. I've devoured all of his work,and have had the good fortune to see him do a reading of 'Squirrelly's Grouper' down in Key West, several years ago. I loved this book, but, was told, at one point by the author himself,that it was the 1st installment in a trilogy. In fact, I was told the second book's working title was 'The Magnificence of All that Burns"". As good as ""Swimming in the Volcano' is,it begs for a follow up. What happens to Mitch? What happens to Issacs? What happens to Cassius Collymore? Perspiring minds want to know!"
5,Worth the Wait,"Because of its limited theatrical release schedule I had to wait and buy this on DVD from Amazon. Most things in todays world are over-publicized and over-hyped. Please believe me, this film is neither. What a tour-de-force in storytelling and what a fine piece of movie making. Doug Block's ""home movie"" really serves up a good dose of emotion: love to curiosity to sadness, fear, doubt, pain, jealousy and redemption. And the beauty of it all is IT REALLY HAPPENED. I'm asking everyone who can to watch this film. Congratulations, Doug. Now, can I read the diary?"
4,astral arts,older material but if you love electronic music it will fit in comfortable in a ambient type setting.
2,Samantha Brown 7 Cities mostly fluff,"I bought this to show in my Spanish class. I previewed it and was very disappointed. It was mostly fluff, too much focused on her reactions rather than the sights, and too silly for my high school students. Rick Steves is much better."
2,"""Buy another verfion.""",I'm not so sure about the integrity of the publisher of a book that serves an aid to the wallet but an adversary to the eyes of one who is not so accustomed to reading such an esoteric font.
4,Almost Perfect Mechanical Pencil,"This is a brilliant design. The side advance is smoothly integrated into the shaft which makes drawing with this thing a joy. I would have given it five stars but I'm not 100% crazy about the most recent version of this pencil. Pentel flared the business end of the shaft and added a rubberized grip. Now the pencil feels bloated and unbalanced, plus the new rubber grip destroys the smooth aesthetic integration of the slick little side advance button. It is still a great pencil, it just used to be better."
1,Couldn't get Printmaster Gold to load on either of 2 computers,"I ordered a copy of Printmaster Gold 16. It was a used copy but was in excellent condition. I have tried to load it onto 2 different computers (my home computer with Windows XP and my computer at work with Vista) and it will not load onto either of them. It only cost me $4.98 plus shipping, so I'm not going to waste my time trying to recover my cost, but this opportunity to write a review came up and I am doing just that. --Bob Boyd"
2,Unhappy With This Version of Printmaster,"I've been using Printmaster since I got a trial version with my first computer back in 1997. I thought the program was so good, I bought a few more better versions and found them very good to work with. I used them quite a bit.I recently got a new computer and bought this version of Printmaster for it. I am very unhappy with it. It has a lot of bugs and is very annoying to use. Plus Broderbund keeps sending me emails that I don't want. I don't know if I will ever buy another Printmaster version again. I am pretty turned off on the product."
1,Unable to run...,"I bought Print Master Gold 16.0, I live in Guatemala city and my shipping adress was my aunt's in Miami Fla. My sister brought it to Guatemala and when I tried to install it in my computer the program doesn't runs. I paid for it I don't live in USA and I think I lost my money. Do you have any idea what can I do?"
2,Extremely Slow read,"This book would have been four stars if half of it was cut out. Many things are repeated over and over. I've skipped over pages and pages that are not needed. Also, in the middle of an intense scene, the main character will have an internal dilemma or dialogue that is just ridiculous.This book is LONG and painfully drawn out. I wish it was edited better because it could've been a very exciting read rather than frustrating."
1,Unbelievable.,"The most unbelievable main character I have ever read. She is so naive that I couldn't believe she made it through the book. The book is also about 75 pages too long.Also, while I am not Catholic, I do NOT agree with Christian authors bashing other Christian's faith."
4,rivetting,Cross Fire is an interesting book which kept you on the edge wanting to know what was going to happen next. A few surprises. A good read.
5,Awesome,"I don't know how anyone could put this book down without finishing it! This is #1 on my list of favorite contemporary Christian fiction, without a doubt. I can hardly wait to read the sequel! I'll definitely be recommending this book to everyone I meet."
5,Crossfire by Jeanette Windle,Interesting story line that really grabbed me. So glad that there's a sequel! I recommended this book to my 2 teenage daughters and they both read it in its entirety and loved it. --Julie
5,Good book,I'm not much of a reader. But this book kept me reading and compelled me to look into her other books. More than worth the read.
5,Recommended,"This was recommended by the breeder from whom I got my Maine Coons. It helps boost their immune systems. One of my cats recently pulled through a health crisis with no ill effects. I attribute her recovery to a wonderful vet, but this could have helped her along as well."
5,Seems to make a difference on my cat's allergies,"One of our cats was sneezing really bad and began to get a goopy eye. Our vet recommended lysine powder for her allergies. We've been using vetoquinol viralys powder for about 9 months now, mixing it in the wet food for both cats once a day and have had no symptoms return. The fishy smell isn't the greatest for us humans, but our cats seem to love it. And the price is much better through Amazon than the vet."
1,"If You Like Elevator Music, You'll Like This CD","The first Kenny Rankin CD I bought was ""Because of You,"" a spare, jazzy CD from the early 90s. Loved it. This CD from 1980 is nothing like it, though. Producer Don Costa did Kenny a disservice by pouring syrupy ""elevator music"" arrangements on top of Kenny's voice. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this CD, and ""The Kenny Rankin Album"" (another Don Costa production). I'm going to try again with Kenny, but I'll stick to his later stuff and his ""live"" stuff. He's best when it's just him and his guitar or piano--he's great, he doesn't need any ""help."""
5,extraordinary,"Porchia never ceases to amaze; on the shelf next to Thoreau and Emerson, he fits perfectly. I agree with the first reviewer; buy ten and give nine to your closest friends.Life is incomplete without certain things; this is definitely one of them."
4,"Sonic Miracle Restores Classic ""'Boheme""","I had owned this version on the RCA budget label, and, though I found the performance compelling, could'nt put up with the boxy muffled sound. What a surprize when I put on these CD's! The engineers have truly worked a miracle, bringing the sound quality up to the standard of many of the best mono recordings. The performance is the most involved and commited you will ever encounter, with Albanese's voice given much more bloom by the new remastering. Incredible detail is heard in the orchestra, and all of the characterizations! These sound like living people, not opera singers performing roles. This is the true ""Boheme"" experience!"
1,Keep looking!!!,"Please save yourself the time and money and look elsewhere. Setup was quite easy though there were no instrutions in the box. The rack attatched easily enough to the car however, that is where the downside started. The wraps to go around the frame to hold it in place would not stay snapped. I ended up using a couple small bungee cords to strap it down.The next downside was that the buckles did NOT hold the straps taunt. The buckles did not have any teeth to prevent the tension from backing off. With this, I ended up knotting the straps so there was minimal play in them. With that said, I still ended up stopping frequently to tighten the straps.Being the Swhwinn name, I believed I would have a better product."
2,"Low price, works only for driving slowly","This rack is a little disappointment for me. It easy to setup but it really designed for toys bikes that has no weight. With adult full size bikes, it has no way to hold when car is driving on regular car speed. First of all, they should have six straps that can hold the rack steady and this rack only has 4. Second, straps are easy to get loose. Third, the brakets that hold the bicycle are no way to tight up. They use 4 plastic botton and 4 holes on the plastic strap to connect in order to hold the bicycles, which is too week and very easy to just open the connection when the car moves fast.To make use of this rack, you have to use some other assistant. I bought a basket of bangee cords and use them tight up bike with rack."
2,Schwinn bike rack,"This product is sufficient for the cost. Nothing too fancy, nothing too terrible. Would recommend locking the frame in, instead of relying on the plastic straps to hold tight."
3,Excellent value for the money.,"I have been contemplating purchasing a trunk bike rack for some time but I couldn't afford to spend a great deal of money. When I received this rack, I was amazed as to how easy it was to mount on my Accord and how versatile the mounting posts were. I have an old '72 Huffy Scout and my wife has an even older middle weight Schwinn girl's bike. I was able to easily adjust the posts to accommodate both with no problems or special bars for the girl's bike. If I can fit these antiques on this rack, I'm sure it will handle almost anything.My intention was to get this rack just to see if I liked the idea and purchase a more expensive ""better"" one if things worked out. I think now that I'll just keep this one and save the money!I would not recommend using this rack if you are going long distances at high speeds but for what I intend to use it for, it's just fine."
3,Thanks,Have not yet read book but am sure it will be very interesting. Your services are much appreciated since professionalism very much displayed in all areas.
3,Ellington 78s - plus a few hi-fi sides,"The first nine tracks on THE ESSENCE OF DUKE ELLINGTON are lower fidelity transfers of vintage 78s. Filtering has eliminated surface noise, but it's also wiped away any clarity these recordings may have once had. The album closes with three better audio quality sides. A two-page Ellington bio accompanies this disappointing SONY/COLUMBIA collection.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 36:05"
5,It will always be in the family,"The Fisherman and his Wife was my sons favorite bedtime story when I use to read to him. I have to laugh because he is now a grown man and now has a brand new baby daughter Remi she is two weeks old now. We moved around alot and somehow the book came up missing so when my daughter had her first child, I ordered one for my 5 year old grandaughter and now it is time to get this brand new baby girl one. I know my son will enjoy reading this story to her, and it has such a good message. If you have never read this, buy it and I know you will understand the moral of the story. It's a great story to add to your library, just be sure you know its packed if you ever move or like me you will be replacing it. I think everyone should read it...I don't want to spoil the story for you but it will teach your children about priorities and the simple things in life are better then greed."
1,Matrix opening bonus interesting. Main feature deceptive.,"I broke down and bought this used because I'd never seen any non-DVD feature interviews with Keanu Reeves and I was curious. I wouldn't really call it an invasion of privacy since all the ""facts,"" both spurious and otherwise, have been in circulation for a long time. No new shockers here I'm glad to say. The narration is inaccurate and offensive. Lots of baseless statements made about the actor's thoughts, feelings and intentions. Clips are used to illustrate events that are obviously not from the actual time and place referred to. Worst is a clip used early on that appears to be Keanu Reeves describing himself. Later you see that it was actually part of an interview about a role he played. I wouldn't bother buying this unless REALLY want it and you can get it used/cheap."
2,Terrible,"This DVD just copied different pieces from many different sources on TV or Movies. They hired someone to talk about all those gossips. I wish I could get refund for this kind of DVD.If you have nothing to do and have too much money, buy it to kill some time and money."
3,"good product, but...","We bought this to use in a second home with both carpet and hardwood floors. It works well on the wood, and about average on the carpet, which is quite understandable for it's size. What keeps this from getting 5 stars is the noise level. This is possibly the loudest electrical appliance we have ever owned, including the router in my husband's woodshop. We cannot use it without wearing ear protection. That's really unacceptable for an indoor appliance no larger than this one."
1,Horrible,"Worst vacuum ever! I have to keep a couple of knitting needles handy to get the stuff off the top of the container. Great suction...for about 5 minutes. Pet hair chokes it even faster. It says it's 'easy' to open and empty canister and it is.... but putting it back together is a nightmare. My parrot has learned a few new words! For the price, buy something else! The $25 electric broom it replaced did a better job."
3,Works great - until it falls apart,"Does everything well. BUT..On the first one, the wheel housing fell apart. Liked it enough to get a second. On the second one the plastic that holds the floor brush broke. Even epoxy wouldn't hold it."
2,Leaves a mess,"Initially I was pleased with its pickup power (compared to our Shark), but I now view it as a failed $50 experiment. The major drawbacks are:- As soon as the power is off, it drops all particles. If you've just cleaned up kitty litter, you'll find it all in a pile under the vac head on the floor once you turn it off.- It creates a high-pitched whine, which actually caused my wife and I some ear pain.- REALLY awkward to use on furniture...needs a brush attachment.- No HEPA filter (forgot to check for this before buying it).- Cord is just as short as the Shark's.On the upside, it's lightweight.I'll be donating mine to Goodwill, and am about to buy one of the fullsize vacs."
4,Good Text for beginners,"If you're looking for something to help you get started in geography, this is the ticket. But if you're attempting to explore more in-depth realms of geography (nature vs nurture) this book will be of little help in getting you on your way. Though it aids in basic understanding of why people in different regions can be different culturally, no one book can adequately encompass the volume of information required to assess such information on a global scale. Feel free to use this book for an elementary college geography class."
1,Pass on this one.,"I was very disappointed in this film. I thought for sure it would be worth watching if for no other reason than Ashley Judd being in it. I was wrong. It is filled with the F word, and her sleeping around. Random comes to mind. It goes nowhere, and the end really doesn't offer much either. It has a cheap feel even though recognizable names are present. I could go on, but it wouldn't matter. It simply comes across as a waste of time. The language is too filthy to put up with, and Ms. Judd's character is very one dimensional. It might be believable if she were playing a cheap prostitute, but her character is no ""Pretty Woman"". Pass on this one."
3,Not too bad,"I was REALLY interested in seeing a Jeffery Donovan movie. This definitely fits that bill. The movie is okay - not the best movie I've ever seen and not one I will watch over and over again. I don't regret the purchase because I wanted to see more of Mr Donovan's work, but I understand why this didn't really do well at the box office. It's not a BAD movie but I would have rather paid $8 rather than $15."
2,"Too vague, not a good movie","""Come early morning"" is about a woman that is tired of her drinking habits, sleeping around and her relationship with her family. The movie was not cohesive enough to deliver a comprehensible plot. The movie was all over the place; never explaining the relationships between the different characters (which remained vague at best), nor the process of growth for Ashley Judd's character, it was merely implied. The movie does not know where to go. Although Judd's performance was good, the rest of the movie did not provide a vehicle where that performance could shine through. Actually, the movie was so vague about pretty much everything that the viewer could not really and truly understand what is going on between the different characters. The movie is also very sad and depressing. Skip it unless you are an Ashley Judd fan."
2,TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!,"This book was a total dissapointment! Although I must commend the subject matter on being interesting, I cannot begin to tell you how unhappy I was with the style of writing. The characters were undeveloped, everytime you were getting excited with the plot the story line just went flat. It was like a bad roller-coaster ride. I was interested in reading this book before because I saw that it was compared to a Chuck Palahniuk novel. IT DOESNT EVEN COME CLOSE!! I would not recommend this book to anybody, its a waste of your time! If you are really interested in ""behind the scenes"" of body building, there has to be something better that you can read."
2,"Promising, but falls short, quite weak","I was initially drawn to this book as it was claimed to be a Chuck Palahniuk-esque book. While the subject of professional women bodybuilders didn't really interest me, I tried it anyways. Now that Im finished, I noticed it's only somewhat like a Palahniuk book. Arnoldi doesn't write in the same style as Palahniuk, which is what I assumed. The theme is what is most like Palahniuk, but even then, the theme is barely similar to his themes.My major gripe with the book is that the climax of the book is extremely weak. At the end, I was thinking, ""this is it? this is the end?"" and was expecting more. At first, I didn't even think there was a real climax. However, I did somewhat enjoy the chemistry between Aurora, Charles, and Aurora's daughter, Amy."
2,4... 3.... 2.....,"In retrospect, the most impressive thing about this book was the author's ability to get as grise an eminence as Joan Didion - whose neurasthenic ""Play It As It Lays"" was clearly a stylistic influence here - to provide a front-cover blurb.It starts out genuinely creepy, with a clinically sharp eye for the grotesqueries of bodybuilding fashion and steroid abuse. But it quickly becomes apparent that Arnoldi has only one effective shot in her posing routine. And the ending is so ludicrous that it wipes out any residual good will still remaining.Samuel W. Fussell's memoir ""Muscle: Confessions of an Unlikely Bodybuilder"" covers this same ground for more thoroughly and interestingly. And it's still available on Amazon."
4,Twisted.,"What a creepy, horrific, and fabulous book. I loved it completely.It looks like a story of a woman willing to do anything to succeed as a bodybuilder, but that's just the surface. At base, Chemical Pink is a perverted love story--a woman who wants perfection falls under the gaze of a man who has a fetish for the development and maintenance of muscular women. He lives through their development and growth and, in exchange for his priceless training and costly chemical intervention, he uses them to play out his sexual fantasies. Freud would have a field day with Charles and his dolls and desire to be treated as a baby, etc. In following this story, I wondered how far Aurora was going to go. The reaction I kept having was 'Are you serious? Really? C'mon, woman!' The ending was delicious and totally perfect.I hope Ms. Arnoldi writes more!"
2,i didn't hate it...,"But that's about all i can say that is positive. Writing style is pleasurable, but it's lacking on content. it's as if someone had an inordinate amount of information about female body building and thought ""gee, i'll write a book using this information..."" and then did so. the story is bland and predictable, and the ending was adbrupt and not at all cathartic.I often see Chemical Pink associated with Chuck Palahniuk, but i find very little in common in terms of style, content, or presentation. While it is true i didn't hate it, i would hate myself for telling a friend to buy this book. if you see it loafing about in a Dentist's office or the like, give it a go, but i certainly wouldn't go out of my way.A book i would point someone too that enjoy's chuck's writing would be The Contortionist's Handbook: A Novelby Craig Clevenger. This will strike you as more palahniukish, and is an impressive read for a first novel on it's own.k."
3,DVD not so gr8!,"I love this movie which is why I ordered it but, the DVD skips quite a bit while playing and some scenes have been cut from the original."
4,"A little sloppy, but fun","I saw the Mavericks a few times before they broke up, and on the Trampoline tour, I was disappointed that they had brought horns for the new songs, but sent them away for the older songs that could have been enhanced. It almost seemed lazy of Malo to bring horns, but not bother to write charts for the older songs.That has been rectified, finally, by this album. Not all of the songs are gems, but the performances are solid and the horns absolutely add depth to the songs. My only real complaint is that the sound mix isn't great. Of course you lose some of the studio precision in a club setting, but it's not like these tapes came right off the board into your car. They could have cleared up some of the muddiness and mixed the horns and vocals a little higher.Other than that, this is worth owning if you like the Mavericks."
2,not pleased,"I think its heavy,the cord is too short and a pain to roll up. The attachments fall off the side ,and the on/ off switch is low on the side.It does have good suction,but I find it annoying enough to buy a new vacuum."
5,Works great!,"The Outback Mag trainer works exactly as advertised. The frame is solid and functions quietly with slick bicycle tires. Easy setup takes less than 5 minutes. If you want to do indoor bike training, the price alone makes the Outback Mag Trainer an option preferable to buying an exercise bike."
1,Freight Train,This is a freight train ... noisy. I can't imagine using it indoors ... or outdoors for that matter. It would be distracting to the neighbors! I'm returning it ASAP.
4,Great value,"I was cooped up in the house for a few weeks and needed to keep busy/active some how. I ordered this trainer thinking that for the money I could take the gamble. I obsessed over the various trainers in this general price range and decided this one had the best ratio of good to bad reviews and the only real issue most people had was noise.I guess I'm just not as sensitive to low level noise because I don't find this to be noisy at all. I do have slick tired on my bike though, so if you're using knobby tires your experience will be different.I'm very happy with this product."
4,great product - no Linux...,"I was looking to build a standalone PVR system with this as the head piece of hardware. Unfortunately, it had no linux support, and I couldn't write it in. on my Windows PC, it ran great, the hardware MPEG encoding took strain off of my CPU and the remote, while futsy, worked well 90% of the time. I ended up returning it for the Linux reason, but would consider repurchasing it if I knew someone that could write the code for me. It was that good."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought these bags in an effort to save my homecooked breads without having to stuff them in ziplocks or wrap in cling wrap.The bags came, they are extremely flimsy and have no ties! How is one supposed to close them?They tear easily and I just threw them away. Lesson learned."
2,"Bead bags, or just lame?","Yea, they came within the promised date, but they didn't have twist-ties and they are ultra thin. They are EXACTLY like a roll that I have for small trash-bins. There is absolutely NO PACKAGING or label to read, that I could determine the PP Number (polypropylene plastic rating), to see if it is even made from food-grade plastic.Oh well."
5,Bread Loaf Bags,I purchased these bags to use with our home-made bread. They are no different then the bread bags purchased in the stores and they keep the bread fresh for over a good week or two. They are light and do the job. I received the shipment in three days as expected. Only one suggestion would be to have tie wraps included. I would definately purchase again.
1,Nothing special about these bread bags,"We had to spend for the bags, shipping and handling which was close to $10. I could have purchased Ziploc bags instead. Nothing special about these bags."
3,good i guess,"It's an okay book, except there are things that are really irritating, first off, it's like, ""Oh poor Linnet is growing wings, she's different everyone shun her boo hoo!"" She has to come to terms with her wings, blah blah. The author is saying, ""It might be hard, but you have to come to terms with your differences and soar like an eagle."" I mean, who on earth WOULDN'T want big beautiful feathered wings????? Linnet is growing gorgeous wings, how horrible? Let's make her a poor little nice protagonist with such awful problems! Did I mention she doesn't have to go to P.E. class? Man, what a perfect life! She has wings, auburn hair, and she doesn't have to go to P.E. And she has problems???"
4,sex pistol before viciousand malcom destroyed them in their glory!,the pistols were not musical geniuses but they were great punk rockers this is the best pistols recording you'll hear from the old days with some great rare songs like i did you no wrong.
4,"Funny, light-hearted novel","This was my first book by Mary Janice Davidson and I was very impressed. This book was defintely one of those books you laughed out loud to. It isnt a serious vampire book, which you can tell by the cover, but the plotline is completely unique and easy to get into. I recommend this for anyone looking for a good laugh. But be warned, it is a chick book."
2,Not worth the buzz,"The book is an absolute bore to read. It is not exciting, adventurous nor funny, in spite of its title that implies comedy and entertainment. To finish one page of this book is an achivement!"
1,PURE TRASH,"If you enjoy vulgarity ad nauseam and no really redeemable characters, this is the book for you. I did like the mom. Betsy and Jessica are good friends but use such bad language when talking with one another it makes one wonder. Betsy literally takes out her bitter disappointment with her cowardly father and horrible stepmother on the whole world. Truth be told, she probably does not like herself. If you never read this book you won't miss a thing. If you really like vampire books, read Maggie Shayne or Christine Feehan."
5,Funny! Witty!,"If Carrie from Sex in the City became a vampire, she'd be a lot like Betsy Taylor, the heroine from this book. Completely shallow, concerned only with her appearance, and the quintessential blonde, Betsy nevertheless has a delightful charm.Some of the plot elements were hysterically stereotyped,(like the greasy pompadour-wearing bad vampire.) Some of the elements were annoyingly stereotyped, (like the 'good' vampire being tall dark and sexy.)Mary Janice Davidson's witty turn-of-phrases and Betsy's irreverant inner dialogue remind me of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the movie, not the show.) I read it in one sitting, and recommended it to two people already."
5,I fell in love with this book,"This is the book that started my MJD obsession. Fun and light hearted humor with a paranormal twist just puts me in a good mood. The hero, Eric Sinclair, is just breathtaking and the chemistry and fire between him and Betsy just sizzles. I admit if one were to look for intense plots with tons of action from a vampire novel, this is not it. Think of it as chick lit meets Alfred Hitchcock. I personally love every character in the book and I hope this series last a long time!"
3,Undead and Unwed book,"It was a fun light read. However Betsy is no Sookie, True Blood is better as far as I am concerned."
2,Such potential...,"I loved the idea of these books. It sounded new and fresh and I was excited enough about reading them that I purchased the first two books in the series. What a disappointment.The ideas are all there and they ARE good ideas, but these are dreadfully, terribly written, and even the greatest ideas are executed so badly that getting through this book was no easy task (and it's a tiny little book too)! I understand why there are so many good reviews of these books - they have a funny theme. If you can get past the writing, and I really don't think I'm a literature snob - I might be wrong, but I really don't think I am - and the, for lack of a better term, ""falseness"" of the characters, you will enjoy the books. They are exactly what they pretend to be.Happy reading."
5,pure phun,"A great fun read. Delightful characters. Love Betsy, don't call me Eilizabeth, Taylor, as she learns the ropes of vampiredom, without the manual. The authore has great ""voice""."
1,Kindle Cost,"I just want to start out by saying that I love this author and the books are a lot of fun- so this review is more in frustration of the cost! Does anyone else find it crazy that the price of the Kindle version of these books are so high, considering the fact that they are electronic AND the cost of the physical copies of the book are so low??!!"
4,The Janet Evanovich of vampire books,"Meet Betsy the vampire queen, who can be a self-centered whiner as well as a very generous and caring person, a walking contradiction who walks only in the best of designer shoes. I've read most of the books in the series and love it. I recently bought this and the second book for my sister who'd been in the hospital and needed some laughs while she recovered. Then I pulled my old copy off the shelf and enjoyed it again. The characters are believably human--or somewhat unhuman as old vampires might become--and the story lines turn on the characters. But Mary Janice Davidson can also take the story in an unexpected direction, while maintaining the continuity of characters, place, and the overall style of the books. Not great literature but lots of fun."
2,NOT,Purchased this a couple of years ago . I do not own it anymore. Was good for the first couple of months then got very loud and kept breaking down. Also was not very convenant having to take two vacuum out to clean my house. Will not purchase again
5,Great Low Calorie Training Treats,"Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training. We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark). They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry. We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors. Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We usePro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce).Our dog loves all flavors."
2,Dog Treats,"The treats were ok,my main complaint is they were small about the size of a lifesaver.Which made it hard to give them to my medium size dog as a treat.One treat just di not do it.This package should be labeled for toy or small dogs."
5,GREAT STUFF AND I LIKED NINA,"A great series and happily able to be taped on the Showtime late night series, although I am getting the DVD for all the behind the scenes material.Contrary to one of the comments below, I think Nina Simeaszko was great. All these girls, such as she and Landon Hall, are astonishimgly beautiful.I wonder how they get their acting training. To me, the ferocity of the sex scenes is unimaginable. I suppose they do exist in real life though."
3,A Maupin's second work,"I've read the six ""Tales of the City"" novels, but not yet the seventh. This film alone is reason enough to return and re-read them all. I watched the third series on Showtime, but never the televised version of the others. I was glad to have the opportunity to see all of them and to remember both Maupin's colloquial blending of San Franciso city life with over-the-top queer life. Too, the chance to watch O Dukakis was worth the price of purchase. J Bourroughs is amazing in her performance and as nearly unbelievable in her costume and make up; I could never identify her were IMDB not so readily available at hand."
1,fees for you and me!,"bah.... wanting me to ""pass a buck along"" for what I should be getting anyways."" new monthly Regulatory Programs Fee (""Fee"") of $0.86 per line of service will be added to your monthly T-Mobile bill, beginning as early as your March 2004 invoice. The fee will help us recover the costs associated with complying with government mandates and programs, such as:* Enhanced 911 which helps emergency agencies determine your approximate location and call-back number when you dial 911.* Number pooling which helps reduce the need to create new area codes.* Number portability which enables wireless customers to bring their current numbers with them.We hope these improved wireless services allow you to Get More.""funny thing is that amazon has this listed as a product..."
4,"ARE YOU READY? YES, NANCY, WE ARE....","The first album from the first true ""bad girl""of pop/rock. Nancy seductively lures you in with her ""kitten with a whip"" snarl, and tames you down with the softness in her voice on such tunes as ""As Tears Go By""A mixture of good verses bad, happy verses sad, and shake them up an you come up with a winner...every time."
2,I was disappointed with this model even at this low price point.,"I wasn't very impressed with this skull and brain combination. I think the most useful thing about it is that you can relate the different parts of the skull to the major brain structures. I also think the skull is good for showing the bones, sutures and a few major landmarks.The brain is made of clear soft plastic and the smaller structures are difficult to see. I don't think there is enough detail in the model for pedagogical purposes and that there are better products out there at a similar price point e.g. LWW Budget Brain with Arteries Model C20C sold my a number of Amazon vendors. This model, however, does not include a skull."
4,Helpfull little book,This Book is good for general to advance caluations in geometry to advanced calculus and differential equations. Help in Bussiness and other areas too. Very good book for engineers and physics to math majors!!
1,Plastic handle - broke on first use!,Bought this same stripper elsewhere. Put it in my electric tool box.Went to use it for LAMP WIRE (!) and the plastic squeeze handle broke right off!Spend more and get an all steel wire stripper.
1,Pure Junk,"Maybe my particular unit was defective. Who knows, but it wouldn't strip wire at all. It ripped it apart. Yes, I adjusted it. It would grab the wire and simply yank it into two pieces. I use hand tools daily in telecommunications and data infrastructure wiring. Let me tell you, this thing is poorly made junk. My company paid for it, so normally I'd just toss something this inexpensive into the trash but it is SO poorly made and so blatantly cheap I'm going to send it back for a refund."
3,Crumbs,"This movie good to see on LSD. Besides that, I mean its sexist and I wish Fritz was a little bit more gangster. The Crow with the Green Zoot suit is throrough! He smashes another crow with a beer bottle to help Fritz. I just sold my copy to Reckless Records. On another note, Crumb is a fine documentary!"
5,Real life cartoon,"I saw this movie the first time when I was stationed in San Diego back in 1973. I couldn't believe it then and being able to buy it so many years later, I had told many of my friends about and they all thought I was crazy. A movie not for the kiddies, but it sure brings back memories of the times."
4,Comanche Moon,Wonderful writing and quite an insight into the Indian traditions. It was very exciting at times as well as a lovely romance.
5,Loved it,"I am very impressed with the authors skill. She developed the characters well, making the reader care about the outcome. The subject matter is interesting. I bought this book because I have read another of her works and was looking for more of the same. I was not disappointed; these are books I will reread and an author whose work I will collect."
2,Screws fell out!,"Very disappointed in the quality of this crane! I researched this toy and read only positive reviews so I asked the grandparents to get it for my son's 3rd birthday. Within a few weeks, screws began to come loose, tiny wooden ""plugs"" covering the screws came unglued, and now almost ALL of the hardware has fallen out (screws, nuts, bolts and washers!!)It was very expensive and now it is so many pieces!!I am going to try to repair it, otherwise it belongs in the trash."
1,So Disappointing,"This is also my first time posting a review on Amazon but I am so disappointed by this toy -- especially given how expensive it is -- that I feel compelled to write. We ordered this toy for my son over a year ago for Christmas and it's been a headache -- the glue used to hold the wooden pieces together has failed and the wooden pegs have fallen out, so my husband has tried to rig it back together with tape, superglue, etc. Unfortunately these fixes don't last long -- and should not be necessary in the first place, since we paid over $70 for the toy, based on some good reviews we read online. We also purchased the bulldozer which has disintegrated even further than the crane.My son was very excited to receive this crane, given his obsession with all things revolving around construction vehicles. It's been very disappointing to watch it fall apart. Guidecraft needs to do some serious quality control on their line of construction vehicle toys."
4,Excellent quality toy crane,Very well made and designed. We also got the fork lift and are equally impressed with that. They maneuver very well and easily. We would certainly buy more Guidecraft toys in the future. I only we wish we discovered them when our son was three (he is nearly five now) when he was obsessed with trucks. They are the best ones he has in his extensive collection.
4,works great!,"I like the thermostat on the heater. The programmable timer on this heater is wonderful for nights and mornings. The annoying thing about the heater is the fact that the oscillate feature is independent of the fan being on. Thus, when the heater is not programmed to be on, it is still oscillating.I am glad to see that Amazon has included some more information about the heater. When I first looked at the heater on the website, there was NO information. I had to do my own research and email Amazon for additional specifications."
3,Not great for bigger rooms,"I purchsased this after reading reviews of a lot of heaters. I had hoped this would kick out more heat. Yes, I do have a 14 x 13 room I was hoping to warm with it...but frankly even if you stand infront of the unit there isn't a lot of heat generated. I have the setting turned all the way up and still don't feel like there is a lot of heat coming from the unit. It is neat that the display tells you how warm the room is, but I'm rather disappointed."
5,DARUDE ROCKS!,"I have reviewed this cd and from what I heard, it sounds like this guy has real talent and should be played in all dance clubs. His music is just so incredible, I can't even begin to describe what it's like for me to listen to him play. I love the Synthesizers and the bass line...you just can't help but dance and move your body to this kind of music! Keep up the good work Darude! You Rock!"
3,"Lots of Energy , no Subtlety","Yes, lots of fun and high energy, some amazingly exciting tracks but will it stand the test of time, probably not...its about as subtle as a sledgehammer."
5,Holy Sweetness Batman!,"WOW! When I bought this CD I was about to die. I popped that baby in and danced so hard I thought I might split my shorts. The tracks are the sweetest I have heard in a LONG time! I even found a secret track. If you play the songs in this order a secret one is unlocked: 1,11,8,6,4,10,2,6,7,3,9,5 It is called ""The beat won't stop"" and I think it may be better than Sandstorm. Check it out."
1,10 steps backward,I was listening to techno back in late 80's that had more soul than this. That's saying a lot if you remember techno from back then. To those who gave more than 2 stars...you REALLY need to get your hands on a Digweed CD. You've been had.
3,Sandstorm Best on CD,"Heard the first hit from this cd on the radio and was happy they mentioned the artist...Darude is new and very talented. But the cd reminds me of Robert Miles' ""Children"" -- same kind of sound. The tracks are danceable but not terribly original after you hear Sandstorm, which is awesome. It's a good cd to listen to while jogging or working out too. I give it three stars."
3,"Good mindless rave music, but there isn't much to it - 3.5 stars","First thing to know about this album - this album is pure mindless fun. Musically it's not very interesting after repeated listens - there just isn't any depth to the songs. The songs, however, remain very fun to listen to. The first three songs ""Sandstorm"", ""Burning"" and ""Feel The Heat"" are my favorites (though as a guilty pleasure), with the rest being good but easily forgettable. If you want mindless rave music I definitely recommend this album, but if you want dance music with depth and longevity then definitely pick up The Prodigy's ""Experience"" or ""Music For The Jilted Generation"". All in all a (sort of) satisfying purchase.Highlights include:""Sandstorm""""Burning""""Feel The Beat""""Out Of Control""""Touch Me Feel Me""""Calm Before The Storm""""Let The Music Take Control""""Drums Of New York"""
5,getcha groove on,"This CD is so addicting! It reminds me of clubbing in London and Spain! It's total hyper music! If you like the dance/techno (or whatever you like to call it) complilations that you can get in Europe, you'll love this (ie: Kiss Clublife 2000)."
2,Don't make the same mistake I did,"This CD is very repetitive and dull! I thought for sure it would be great after listening to ""Out Of Control"", but don't be fooled, this CD is probably the worst CD in my collection. Darude may have been good for Sandstorm, but let's all face it: after 2 plays, the song got old. Real old. Don't buy this CD."
2,Hard to use,"It's a 2x2x2 rubik's cube except the back of his hood is just a mix of misshapen black and the puzzle itself is very hard to twist around smoothly. Not a very fun toy even if you know how to solve it, and if you can't be bothered to solve it then it'll just sit forever unsolved or will be solved with the guide once and sit there forever."
5,By far my favourite,"The last of Sheena's British albums. I loved it back in the 80's and it still holds up now. The ballads are by far the best thing on the album with Ice Out In The Rain, In The Winter and I Wouldn't Beg For Water all stand out tracks. But by far the best song is her version of Wind Beneath my Wings. This is beautifully sung and vastly superior to the over-sung Bette Midler travesty that was the hit version. An under-rated album and unfortunately the last album she did in this style. Her American albums just weren't the same."
5,Amazing if anything,"Anyone who takes offense to the title or musical influence is ignorant. Condon may be 19, but he's obviously an older soul than any of us. The music is perfect and it's point is puposeful and beautiful, which is hard to find these days... The name, the sound, the message is potent... Casting stones from no house at all, shame on you. Listen and learn"
2,OVER-REACHING..NEEDS DISCIPLINE AND A METHOD,"In a world of the inevitable forthcoming Brittney Spears cd..this will pass the muster, for most. I however would rather just listen to the traditional music from the ACTUAL land the group is mimicking...soon ""Beirut"" will morph and help to sell vases for pier one over the in store PA ...ill call this one pretentious..."
3,pretty but unworn,"This ring looks just as pretty as its picture. Its thin and very feminine. However it is rather uncomfortable. I think I wore it twice. But Im also a bit sensitive to jewlery. So if your not, you'll probably like this ring. It really does look good."
1,Problem Activating,"Hello,For some reason I am having trouble Activating this product. I called Microsoft support and they told me to do the repair. I did that and it still gives me problems. The product shows that it is Activated and registered but in all the programs except Access, I have to accept the license agreement every time I open the program.Any help you can give me or can I get a replacement. They told me to uninstall it and then reinstall it. I am going to try it and see what happens."
2,Strange wheels,"Great bike, until I had to buy new tires for it. I quickly realized that the standard 700cX25 size tires don't fit on this bike. It has been incredibly frustrating trying to find tires that actually fit."
4,Two steps away from perfection!,"I've been a Cherrelle fan for years. I agree with the reviewer who rates ""The Woman I Am"" as her best work ever (Hello Record Label--Rerelease that CD!) But I believe this CD will create a whole new group of Cherrelle fans. Her vocals are like butter--play this CD during your next romantic dinner and watch your partner melt! Best tracks--Stop Loving You and Pillow Talk."
3,Like a second skin,"When considering what size to order, I decided to go up one size to allow for easy glove removal when wet. I based this decision on the fact that I almost always wear a medium in any type of glove, but I was taken by surprise as these went on skin tight. As can be expected, removal was a chore. Every single finger turned inside out as I struggled to get them off my medium sized hands, and this was when the gloves were still DRY and right out of the box. Doing so after washing the dishes is going to be a pain."
4,Vamwolf,"Lasts longer than the gloves I have been using, but they are large for Women's hands. I have taken to keeping them stuffed, when not in use."
4,"My favorite, just wish they lasted longer","Love these gloves, have tried numerous, numerous, numerous kinds. I just wish they lasted longer than a few months. Eventually, a hole develops in a finger. So I keep two pairs on hand."
3,Too tight.,"These gloves are shown to be a large size, but they are definitely too small for my hands. I suppose I can still save them for an emergency, but I'd never try to do dishes with them or anything that takes any sense of touch or coordination because the gloves restrict movement too much."
5,I've had them for a few months and they are still going strong,"I don't do a TON of dishes, but I do some everyday, so these gloves get used. I used to buy packs of the flimsy yellow gloves to do my dishes, and those would rip pretty fast. I was nervous about spending this much money on one pair of gloves, but it turns out they last.FYI - they do run a bit small. I am a tall skinny woman, so I have big hands for a woman, but they are on the bony side. These gloves fit me in size Large, but they would likely not fit an average sized man, or a large sized woman with thick hands."
3,What ?!?!?!?,"You know, I'm not sure what it was but after a few months of use the noise output of this vacuum rivaled that of Air Force Jets, no, seriously. Other than that, I did like the vacuum."
4,GREAT VAC,I needed a new vac. This one was easy to put together...just put a screw in the handle. Lightweight and not real loud. Easy to push and cleans very very well. I wish I got this vac sooner!
2,Worked great for about 6 months,"I bought this vacuum when we purchased our house - with brand new low-pile carpet. Worked great for the first 6 months or so, but then started getting louder and louder every time I vacuumed. It eventually got so loud that we could hardly stand to use it. Then one day it just started smoking (burning electrical smell), lost power, and died. I would call this a great ""disposable"" vacuum. A good model to purchase until you can save for a nicer one."
3,This Is Not A Text,"This is not a paperback of one of Murphy's texts! Don't be confused. It is a work book to test your comprehension as you read the text. Since I did not have companion text, I did no more than scan this book and have no comment on it's content."
2,"Didn't Work on Dog, but works Great on Clothes.","Didn't work on dog but works great on clothes. I'm glad it worked for these other folks, but it didn't work on my dog. It's soft and may feel good to the animal, but as far as removing fur, it didn't. I've tried this item, a slicker brush, pet glove, hair brush and the Furminator. The Furminator worked the best, hands down. It's expensive, but it really works!"
5,Much Much better than I expected,"My cats have a carpet covered tower that they love. I was ready to get rid of the tower because their fur was embedded in the carpet. The tower was starting to look old and dingy and I tried everything I could find to clean it. Vacuuming and rolling with sticky tape rolls barely made a difference. I tried the FURemover last night and it took all the fur off the tower. I couldn't believe it but it looked brand new! It even took off the little pieces of carpet that the cats scratched out.They didn't say it on the packaging anywhere, but it takes a little while for the static charge to build up and I found that it was easier to use circular motions to get the fur that was really embedded in the carpeting. It does create a mess of ""fur bunnies"" but it's easy to just vacuum them up afterwards.I didn't find it particularly effective for grooming the cats. The Shed Ender is the best thing we've found for that."
5,Excellent,Shipped quickly was packaged very well and arrived as described in review of VHS. Will use this seller again!
2,What the...?!,"It's hard to know exactly how to take this album. The very idea of a bluegrass version of AC/DC songs sounds like a parody. Yet, for some reason, these musicians seem to take themselves pretty seriously. However, AC/DC's already ridiculous lyrics sound even more absurd (if that's possible) sung with a bluegrass backing. Also, the running time is barely 30 minutes (Come to think of it, I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing!). And what audience are they trying to appeal to anyway? It's hard to imagine serious AC/DC fans going for this, & the musicianship isn't so overwhelmingly great that it would appeal to bluegrass fans. Personally, I'd avoid this one."
4,this memoir stands out,"Setting aside the obviously very interesting racial issues, this memoir stands out among other memoirs which in my opinion tend toward the melodramatic and self-indulgent. I liked this book a lot more than I expected to like it, and that is a huge compliment!"
4,Not an uncommon story,"The book was interesting. However, stories as such are unfortunate but not rare. I found the relationship between daughter and mother was one of water being thicker than blood. I commend June Cross for her steadfast loyalty to her mother. Her mother knew the consequences when she slept with Stumpy Cross (June's father). As I read I could only think of the psychological long term effects her experiences with her mother would have on her. Her mother blamed the times/era for her decision to give up June. In reality she wanted to move on with her life and with a Black child in tow that may have been difficult within the circles she wanted to be part of. Having White friends was more important than claiming her own daughter. It annoys me that people want to test the waters and never prepare for the consequences. Read the book to really get a better understanding. It will probably annoy you as it did me, even though is was nicely written."
4,Racism & Relationships in this Generation,The story is compelling in its complexity. That it starts with the author's birth in 1954 the book highlights the recent events and history of the US I have grown up in and witnessed. As the adoptive mother of two bi-racial children I found her mother's actions perplexing and hard to understand...but her daughter wants the reader to understand.
4,Interesting Read,I thought that this was a really good book. It draws you in and you feel for the author for the emotional quest that she goes through.
1,The great Mavericks,"I enjoyed the DVD. Not every song I like was on it, but I enjoyed every song in the concert. I hope to see more Maverick DVD's."
4,Works OK,Got this for my elderly father who cannot hear very well. He can hear the ringer and I turned the handset volume up high and it seems like he can hear better with that. Tried to explain the boost button to him so it would increase volume even more but I think he forgets about that...... The boost feature is where I noticed that the sound quality goes downhill so maybe its best to not use it unless absolutely neccesary.Hope it gives good service...
2,Amplified Phone Model XL50,"Several years ago I bought a similar phone. I now needed an additional extension, so I eagerly purchased a new one. When you have a severe hearing loss, as I have, your choices of equipment are really limited. This item is a disappointment, and I do not recommend it. At higher amplification, voices ""cut out."" This happens with cell and landline calls. Additionally the sounds emitted by individual keys are non-existent on my phone. The keys cannot be used to select from a menu (you know, ""press one for..."" press two for...""). This phone will be returned."
2,Bratz Walkie Talkie dissapointing,"I really expected more of this product when reading the description.Within 15 minutes of use, the antennae fell off of one. Upon examining it, I discovered that it was for decorative purposes only and had no useful purpose. We also had a hard time getting it to function properly.My granddaughter, who loves stuff like this, rarely plays with it. She wanted a REAL walkie-talkie and this one performs like a ""pretend"" one."
3,"Honey, have you seen my meat cleaver?","Thrashers Death Angel spare no souls on the misleadingly titled ""Frolic Through the Park,"" an album I was led to believe featured sounds of love and happiness. Boy, was I ever the fool. I guess the name of the band, Death Angel, should have tipped me off. At any rate, these boys are angry, and by God, they're gonna let the world know it. Never in my life have I sat through such ear-splitting nonsense. You can't even understand what the singer is frustrated about, for God's sake. This is just noise for the sake of noise, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, except, perhaps, those with no sense of musical adventure or imagination.Frolic through the park, indeed.Honey, have you seen my meat cleaver?"
5,My dads book-f4 phantom: A pilots story!,"F4 phantom:A Pilots story-is great!-when my dad{the author of the book}gave me a copy-and i finaly got round to reading it-i found it was thrilling;exiting and well realy good :)-i enjoyed it!-and i hope if you do read it, you will enjoy it to!"
1,"Not just bad, dangerous","The production values are poor (horrible music, bad costuming).The exercises themselves are fine, but the amount of time she has you hold them is excessive. I did the video once and only got through 70%. I now have SI joint dysfunction. Do not buy this video."
5,Excellent cable management,"This product works great. Organizes cables very well, looks slick, easy to install, cut, and bend, and the result is very professional. The 3/4"" was enough for as many as 5-6 speaker wires or 3 HDMI, 2 network cables, and a coax because it expands. Only problem is that it worked so well, I used up the 25' quickly - should have bought more. Highly recommended."
1,An Interpretation of Page Sixty-four,"Since it is a reprint of a 2005 communications book, I guess that it is amazing that it was not reprinted in smoke signals.In the last sentences on page sixty-four the author uses his quick-wittedness to communicate a lucid moment in which he (this is my understanding) takes the initiative to beg the reader not to return their book for a refund and give up the entire idea of making any sense of it.(c) All rights reserved"
1,Wrong introduction,"A completely wrong introduction - no tracks from first 2 albums.Avoid at any cost, otherwise you'll get a wrong impression of the band - actually, after the first two it was a completely different act - still competent and confident, but they've drifted from powerful progressive rock spiked with a strong dose of psychedelia towards uninspiring mainstream - wasting unique and powerful voice of Steve Gould. The solo project -Runner- was competent, but it was not ""rare Bird"" either. As a passionate fan of ""Rare Bird"" I bought ""Third Time"" myself - just to have it. But if you want to have a good introduction, getSympathy. Warning: there a ""live"" album (a bootleg) around - with the same cover as the first album - the quality of sound is awful - it's a fragment of geniune concert recorded directly from mixing console + couple of songs recorded for BBC. If only a proper ""live"" would be available..."
1,This version sucks,I'm a costumer from mexico i grew up whith the knights of the zodiac that's the name in mexico the version i used to watch was ADV version this version from DIC is horrible this version doesn't represent the real soul of what anime is. please do no buy DIC's version
2,Boring Snoring,"I have been to many Pilates classes, and although I am only eight I have been doing Pilates for three years.I like fast and difficult. This was slow and snoring. I was staring at the time bar,praying for it to be over. I found the movements very repetitive and the production values very cheesy. I found myself yelling at the screen telling her to do something different.At the end my mom and I lay on the floor suddenly I popped up and said ""Mom, is she sleeping?"" That brings us to my feelings about this tape: one big bore!"
5,Such a deal!!!,I thought this product is just awesome for my 2 year old son who is currently obsessed with everything fire fighter! He has not left the house with out his helmet since we got it 3 weeks ago... sometimes in jacket too! (Imagine the reactions we get at the stores!) It is durable and has plenty of room to grow into. There are plenty of additional props to boost his creativity. I am very impressed with the quality. (You would think I work for Imaginarium the way I brag... but I don't! - I am just a penny pinching stay at home Mom who is happy to find some bang for her buck.)
1,Works good if,you can get a tube that's not dried up. Two of the three I ordered were completely dried up and unusable.
2,A PREDICTABLE MOVIE,"IT IT SLOW,THE STORY COULD BE BETTER, BUT THE WAY ITS DONE IT MAKE THE WHOLE MOVIE TOO PREDICTABLE CAUSE YOU CAN GO AHEAD OF THE PLOT, KIND OF KNOWING THE NEXT STEP.... TOO ORDINARY, MAYBE OK FOR T.V. DRAMA"
4,Magic Mushroom Band - 'Process Of Illumination' (Voiceprint),"Originally released in 1990 - on the band's own label, Fungus. More or less, another healthy dose of the UK's own Magic Mushroom Band's stunning psych-space pop. Tracks that definitely did it for me were their Beatle's cover ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" (I've always liked the Pink Fairies and Helio Sequence's versions of this classic as well), ""What's on Your Mind"", ""Halcyon Daze"" and tripping ""Kaleidoscope"". Too bad this band is longer."
3,Highways?,"Yes, as others have mentioned, the editing is terrible! Punctuation (particularly apostrophes) are in all the wrong places. The subject matter is interesting, however the title is a misnomer. . . Strange Highways? Why did the author choose to call it that title when most of the stories are his personal experiences and those of his friends and family in his hometown? Other topics were covered, such as the Jersey Devil, Bigfoot, etc. but the information was basic and not anything you haven't seen in a thousand other books."
2,Title is Very Misleading......,"If you're looking for strange highway stories across America, this book isn't it. Most of the stories are Tennessee based. That's because Jerry lives near there. Also, Jerry talks about happenings not even based in America like Springheel Jack. His cattle mutilations rant is very biased and he has little in his book to back up his claims. This book is a mess............Stay Away............"
1,Quite unbelievably bad,"This book is dreadful. And I don't mean that in a good way. I've bought and read a lot of dreadful books about the paranormal, but this has to be the most disappointing, because of the author's name.Loren Coleman he's not. Jerry D. Coleman didn't even have the consideration for his readers to employ an editor. Which actually provides some of the book's only worthwhile moments - the howler malapropisms that dot the landscape of otherwise truly depressingly bad writing. Somehow, some way, maybe with paranormal help, he has managed to make the paranormal boring. I so wish I'd spent the money on something else. Fie."
2,my thoughts on book,book is very hard to follow and is boring . not much real information . some pages look like photo copys and print is small
4,Fight Dirty,"Fight Dirty is good - especially as I now have two copies.I cannot comment on Good Morning America as I never received it despite complaining to Amazon twice and eventually they (Amazon) telling me they were not going to fulfill the order.Yet they still continue to advertise this product as a double/2 CD package. Word of warning to anyone considering purchasing this item - it is not what it is advertised as. Shame on you, Amazon."
5,Bring Out The Hero In Your Home!!!,"I got this for Christmas and the second I played my first game I knew it was AWESOME!!! It takes maybe 15-30 minutes to set up a battlefield, but its well worth it. The charecters are very detailed. Like on the dragon, you can see tiny detailes put in by a VERY good artist. If you need a birthday present for a kid (or maybe even an adult LOL) or Christmas money to burn, LOOK INTO THIS! Although, if you are not a person who likes strategy games, this is one. But, heck, maybe even if you do hate strategy games this will change your mind. It's well worth the money to buy it! HIGHLY recomended!"
3,Make sure you have time to help your kids play with it...,I bought this for my 9 year old son who had seen it at friends houses and really wanted it. He loves it and loves building battle scenes with it but didn't get to play with it properly until the Chritmas holidays because you really need to be able to spare a lot of time to work out the rules and play it properly. That said it is great for imaginary play even if you don't follow the exact rules.
1,Go back to playing Chess.,"This game stinks! Seriously, I played it once when my friend was over.1st : Set-up, and make the board.App. time : 2 hours2nd : I teach him how to playApp. time : 1 hour3rd : We all pick teams and our guysApp. Time : 30 minutes4th : His parents have arrived.NOTICE ON HOW OUR 3 HOUR AND 30 MINUTE DAY OF FUN, TURNED OUT TO BE A STINKING LOUSY SET-UP DAY!5th : clean up!!App. Time : 3 hoursNOTICE ON HOW IT TAKES 6 HOURS TO SET UP AND PUT AWAY THE GAME! IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO PLAY THIS, MAKE SURE HE KNOWS HOW TO PLAY AND GET THE GAME BOARD SET-UP! BUT DOING THAT EVERYTIME STINKS! GO BACK TO PLAYING CHESS!!!!!"
5,best new game invented,"this has got to be one of the best newly invented games since monopoly, life, etc. I got it for my son after a alot of saying no, no, too expensive. well its has got to be one of the best buys I ever made. we play together, or he plays himself, all the time, been a whole 2 months now, never seems to tire of it.Reccommend very highly. we even leave it set up on the dinning room table..."
4,Good low-cost replacement stylus,"This is a replacement stylus for the Shure M93e cartridge and requires 2 grams tracking force. It also fits my very old Shure M91ed cartridge, designed to track between .75 and 1.25 grams. I realize that using this stylus with my M91ed requires me to use 2 grams of pressure, but at this low price I don't care about the extra gram. It tracks really well.The tip radius is .0003 x .0007Made in Japan"
4,Acceptable replacement for N91ED,"Tracks at 2 Grams well,dependable,sounds great with the M91ED Cartridge. Advice----as with all Styli,get a good stylus cleaning brush,e.g. Discwasher SC-2,Ect.,and clean it gently after each album side."
5,Great Autobio,Dayton Hyde is a special man and his story is very interesting to read about. Dayton's Black Hills Wild Horse Sanctuary is a magnificent place to go to where he has given a home to rescued mustangs and preserved the land.
2,"Blip in the digital download of ""Everything Right is Wrong Again""","I love this album and TMBG - I'd give them 4 stars. The 2 stars is for the Digital MP3 version of this album. On the first song (Everything Right is Wrong Again) at 1:42 in, there is a blip in the song. It's one of my favorite songs on the album and the blip is very distracting. I wish Amazon would get a fixed version of that song for the MP3 version."
4,my 6 year old granddaughter adores her new Chi Chi Chihuahua!,"My granddaughter, who loves dogs but cannot have one was thrilled to receive this toy for Chirstmas & takes it to bed with her every night. It is very cute!"
5,Love this toy,"I got this toy for a great price, and it was deliver to me in less than expected. It was more than I expected and looks just like a little apple head chihuahua. For those dog lovers I totally recommended."
4,Great lil dog,"My 3 yr old loves it. It's pretty cute, walks around and is simply adorable with the kitten. Couldn't find these anywhere in the stores and the price is great."
3,Construction of legs seems frail,"This toy is cute and apparently looks real enough to fool dogs, judging from the reaction of mine when they saw it. I bought it for my nephew as a Christmas present and he seems to like it. The main flaw I've found is that the legs seem to be frail and the fabric isn't attached properly to them so it tends to shift and create a wrinkled appearance."
1,"Dirty, Used Toy, not suitable for sale","This product was subpar on every level. It came poorly packaged, and the item appears to have been previously used. The nose on the dog had scuffs, the footpads were dirty, the actual mechanism that allows the toy to walk was broken, as was his voicebox. All in all a horrible product with no response from the seller when I let them know."
1,Not Worth The Money,I paid over $19.00 for this toy and it is not worth it. I just took itout of the plastic wrapper and there is a stain on both ears and down the back.The nose is also crooked. I bought this for my little granddaughter for Christmas.Amazon usually carries good quality merchandise but this one is very poor.Stay away from this product and spend your money on something of better quality.
4,Chi-Chi The Chihuahua,"This little dog is cute and does what is described. However, our one year old granddaughter is not real impressed. Maybe it's better for younger ones."
2,Plastic Dreams,"As a kid growing up all I ever really wanted was a Pocket Fisherman. But given its high cost and the lack of hunting and fishing spots in Queens, NY, my parents never sprang for one. Bastards. Anyway, the best thing about being an adult (besides riding in cabs naked) is that you finally get to buy your own toys - and I just got my Pocket Fisherman after all these years. But you know what? I'm still miserable! I'm still short and pale and awkward and fat and my prom date still threw up on me! And there's no Pocket Fisherman that's going to change all that. Ever. It's just PLASTIC! It has no soul. It turns out that it's just a deceptive little mechanism that promised false happiness to me and many others. On balance, I would probably not recommend this product."
4,Comprehensive,"Written in a fast-paced style, this book fills in some of the gaps of the activities of the Russian Airborne forces before, during, and well after World War Two. The author also gives mention to other Soviet/Russian Special forces though in some areas (such as the Long Range Scouts, a forerunner to the Spentnatz) he barely seems to get going on a topic before changing the subject (probably because that could be a book unto itself). The book provides a great starting point for study. The author uses many different sources. I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a good overview of the Soviet Airborne operational history."
2,Disappointed,"I found this book dissappointing. It gives readers misinformation that can make symptoms of NLD worse, not better. For example, the author encourages the readers to allow video/computer play stating it ""builds eye-hand coordination"". Not only will this NOT develop eye-hand (that comes from anticipating a three dimensional object coming to you in space and manipulating the hands to accurately receive it"" but fixation on computers often leads away from motor development and soical interaction. We don't need more misinformatoin about NLD."
3,"Superficial, obvious and misinformative","For anyone completely unfamiliar with the horror genre and the films that comprise it, this isn't too bad a place to start. That being said, the analysis, especially in the auteurs section, is both simplistic and flippant. This is mainly because the book tries to cover too much ground and cover the entire filmography of someone like John Carpenter or George Romero in only 10 pages or so. Plus, there are factual errors. Georges Franju directed 'Eyes Without a Face,' not Henri-Georges Clouzot. It's hard to trust a book's information when simple factual errors are made."
5,A great film for the entire family.,"Gosh, this classic is the remedy for rowdy kids. Sit them in front of the tele and relax with some herbal tea and slashed eyeballs. Nothing like blood streaming from your mouth to ease the FISH FISH FISH."
4,bad production,"jimmy. what happened? you used to be awesome...maybe this is why kurt cobain committed suicidealways remember ""...foetus...,"" the most amazing groups in the world"
2,Not well made,I just received my water key and the quality of the socket is very low. All they did was bend a piece of metal into a U shape and put it on the end of the rod not like the socket type I have used in the past that has a slit in it. Had I seen a close up of the end I would have not ordered it.
4,A Continuation of Thoughts on Subjectivity,"This is a contituation from her earlier publications, ""Gender Trouble,"" ""Bodies That Matter."" Those who read these two texts would find this book extremely interesting. Butler seems to move her theorization of subjectivity from the materiality of the body (in previous texts) to the psychic realm of subjectivity. Please note that this is NOT a reflection of Cartesian dichotomy of mind/body. Rather, I understand her move as strategic choice, in order to deepen her analysis of power and its relation to psychic realm, before delving into the inextricable reality of psyche and body. Here Butler draws on the works of various philosophers, such as Hegel, Althusser,Nietzsche, Freud, Foucault and so on, to explicate the complex process through which power engenders a psychic form (see intro), and constitutes a self. As always, her eloquent rhetorical style and brilliant epistemological turns are amazing enough."
5,GREAT BOOK FROM FORMER CLIENT OF HALEY'S COUTURE,"ANYONE WHO KNOWS ROSLYNN MATTHEW OR HAS PURCHASED A BIRKIN FROM HER, KNOWS THAT HALEY'S COUTURE IS A TOP, HONEST COMPANY THAT HAS BEEN FEATURED IN THE PREMIER SPRING EDITION OF VITALS WOMAN MAGAZINE. I HAVE BOUGHT 3 BIRKINS FROM HER AND ALL OF MY BIRKINS WERE AUTHENTIC AND ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!NOW, IT IS WONDERFUL THAT SHE IS SHARING HER EXPERTISE AND WISDOM WITH THE REST OF US. THE BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT SOURCE OF INFORMATION. IT PROVIDES DETAILS ON THE HISTORY OF HERMES, AND GIVES STEPS ON HOW TO GET YOUR NAME ON THE HERMES WAITING LIST! IT ALSO GIVES SOME ADVICE ON HOW TO BUY ONLINE. SHE DOES NOT PROMOTE HER BUSINESS IN THE BOOK, BUT SHE ENCOURAGES YOU TO BUY FROM THE BOUTIQUE. IT'S AN AWESOME BOOK AND WELL WORTH THE MONEY!"
2,useless for computer career advice,"There is little need for this book, if you're looking for specific advice on tailoring a resume for a computer job. It has generic information about writing any resume. And then it has example resumes for various computer careers. Useless. You are far better off to invest some time in searching around for what computer professions are currently lacking people, and to see if there is a possible fit for you. It is more effort than merely reading this book, but potentially more productive. This way, you get to research actively what is out there, and possibly even find out what to study."
5,Best Ever,This is the GREASTEST collection I've ever heard.. I didn't know it has been around for so long.. VERY ENJOYABLE...
3,The Duke...,"As a fan of John Wayne I jumped at the chance to own a copy of this directly after it was released. Now, I tend to consider myself a patriot, and I loved the Duke no less after I heard this album. However, we live in a nation now, which celebrates it's diversity, indeed, what each of us brings to the whole. This is represented by many millions of Americans, by the hyphon, something which the Duke considers ""evil"". Now, this was a different time, different place, and a different point of view, which should still be heard and considered. I personally feel this was the ""wrong"" point of view, but he surely had his reasons. If seperate was not equal, that to seperate ourselves, limits how we are similar or equal. In fact, I used to think this way, but not anymore. Now, I love the Duke anyway; overlooking this small point. Buy the CD, you'll love every minute of it, whether you agree with the man or not."
1,Lousy Customer Service,I didn't rec'v my used cd. The seller didn't sent it to me and I ordered it 2 weeks ago. I had to contact him to find that he didn't have it. Said he sold out. There was only one used cd when i purchased it and it was confirmed.
5,"AMERICA, WHY I LOVE HER","WONDERFUL CD AND IT SHOULD COME OUT BEFORE THE 4TH OF JULY EVER YEAR!!THANK-YOU FOR HAVING IT,BEEN LOOKING FOR SOME OF THE TRACKS ON IT AND IT'S NOT JUST PLAYED ON THE 4TH,IT'S AN EVER DAY CDTHANK-YOU"
1,Golf Games ????????,This book doesn't even rate 1 star. The author obviously knows nothing about golf or the types of games that can be played. I'm really surprised that any publisher would even publish this trivial attempt. I felt that the purchase of this book was a complete waste of money
1,Do not buy!,"As another reviewer stated, this is not a triple pack of 3, it is a single triple pack and is a horrible deal."
2,Anecdotal but not insightful,"Farwell's title is somewhat misleading, as ""Queen Victoria's Little Wars"" includes substantial sections on the Crimean war, Indian Mutiny & Boer wars: the largest wars of Victoria's reign. Filled with anecdote, the book makes diverting reading, but contains little in the way of analysis and tends to give the impression that British military activities were more independent of the civil power than was the case. The wars in New Zealand which, proportionate to the numbers of combatants the British faced, required more soldiers than any other colonial wars, receive scant attention. Absent entirely is mention of British military activities in Australia, possibly because such activities were more genocidal than honourable in nature. Incursions into Central America are also unexamined. Highly entertaining, the book is ideal as a brief introduction to both well and lesser known aspects of Imperial history."
1,I'd like to have a -0- star rating.,"If you liked LaPlante's courageous heroine, Lorraine Page, this is NOT the book for you.If you need a ""Lorraine"" fix, re-read the first two stories in this series and marvel again at how very brave Lorraine was to pick up the pieces of her shattered life.It's hard to believe that LaPlante would do this to Lorraine. I won't be reading any more of her stories, that's for sure."
2,Disappointing,"I read the first two books in the series and throughly enjoyed them. Naturally I was looking forward to the third, but was very disappointed in the story (which was boring) and the way the novel ended. Why the author apparently hated this character so much that she had to devise this ending for her is unknown, but it was a real downer. She should have stopped with the second novel."
4,Ed Calle Plays Santana,"I first heard Ed Calle's version of ""Black Magic Woman"" on the Miami based [...] Latin Jazz Quarter show. You can hear this Radio Station ""Live on the Internet"" (7) days a week. I was very impressed with this new version of this old Santana Classic. I went to CDNOW.com to hear the other tracks on this cd and thought that they were all a very good. I also discovered that Ed Calle-Plays Santana is his 6th Album. This is the first time he's tackled an individual artist's music (Carlos Santana) and his efforts have paid off with a Grammy Nomination for the Best Instrumental Album of 2005. I ordered this CD from CDNOW.com and recommend this to all Latin Jazz fans. You will not be disappointed...."
5,Reflexology Massage,"I was curious about reflexology so I purchased this dvd. It gives an overall history, about reflexology ,and how it has developed over the years, and how to do it yourself, for family or friends. I think its an awsome deal."
5,Sterling silver band,"My fiancée wanted a sterling wedding ring since he wears a lot of silver. This ring arrived quickly, in an adorable gift box, and is exactly what we wanted."
5,Nostalgic Music,Since the slowdown with the economy I have more free time to kick back and review my life. My parents would sing Spike Jones songs to us when we were children in the 1950's. Now they are available on CD - digital. Way cool!
4,"Classic, but dated","If you can still get it, it's worthwhile for the support pro. While it isn't the most current or best written book available for support, it's one I wouldn't trade away.Strengths: problem defining & solving, phone skills, difficult customers."
4,a good start to gardening,"Actually this is a very interesting book for someone who is new to gardening. The pictures are colorful and descriptive. Garden basics are included: site and exposure, weather, micro-climates and making the most of your soil; important issues that the newbie should remember. If you want some ideas that include beds and borders, paths, boundaries, and water features then this is a nice start.For the more advanced gardener it includes ideas for containers, edible gardening, greenhouses and transforming your lawn. As with anything outdoors you must remember plant zones and what is appropriate to plant for your area. A little weak in this area it is still a nice book to give as a gift. I intend on letting my daughter, who needs ideas for her house, use this enjoyable garden book."
5,praise from a midwife,"I think this video is right on target. I show it my clients as well as to groups interested in learning more about birth, and to college students when I am a guest speaker. I haven't heard a single negative comment about the video yet."
5,The Italian American Family Album,"This book, although written for older children, is a good read for adults as well. It shows the story of Italian immigration starting in Italy, which few accounts do. The pictures from Italy give the reader a setting to contrast with American cities and towns of the times. The interviews with the immigrants give a flavor of the struggles they went through and clarify their reasons for leaving their homes and families. The sections on Italian American ommunities and their traditions and contributions are a source of pride for all Italian Americans. A highly recommended book for those wishing to understand the immigrant experience."
1,One Star Is Too Much For This Awful Album,"I am going to summerize my feelings about this album in ONE word: UGH! Trust me, this is terrible! Don't even bother. If someone tries to sell this to you RUN, don't look back, RUN fast! It's really bad rock/metal from a band that should've called themselves C.R.A.P. instead of T.S.O.L."
5,what you come to expect from Jeffries,"This was a great, fun, quick, witty, wonderful read. This book shows what the author does best which is to tell a story that keeps your attention and entertains and keeps you wanting more.I do wish I would have read this before reading ""Only a Duke will Do"" only to get the full effect of that book. But none the less still worth it no matter the order.I loved Regina and Marcus and felt that both characters were relate able and worth loving and through out the book I wanted to see them work it out and find the love. I recommend this book to those who enjoy Sabrina Jeffries, you will not be able to put it down."
3,"I'm a very picky reader, but it was good. I give it a B.","I liked Regina's spirit, and she can hold her own in an arguement! thumbs up. I liked Draker too mainly b/c of his refreshing views on how the snobby ton really pisses him off, and his gruff nature although he is paranoid - it's understood when you read about his childhood. bonus - he has a hot facial scar and he's a good description of ""scruffy hotness"" who becomes ""clean-shaved hotness"". thumbs up. I'll read the 3rd book in a little while from now, but I'm not anxious to read them back-to-back. But, hey this book delivered what I expected.FINAL GRADE: (B) the book was what I wanted to read at the moment, but having read it now, it's not on my ""keeper"" list. I'll get to the 3rd book later, but I only take these as good, light, fun read."
4,Brooklyn Noir 2: the Classics,"Interesting concept...a follow-up to the excellent Brooklyn Noir 1 with a collection of ""classic"" short stories ranging in tone from H.P. Lovecraft's stately ""Horror at Red Hook"" to Hubert Selby's torrid ""Talala""(an excerpt from ""Last Exit to Brooklyn""). Something here to please everyone, but not everything to everyone's taste. Not quite as entertaining as the original BN1 but the stories are well chosen and varied in style, a worthy addition to the Noir collections."
2,Bigger is sometimes better....,"I purchased this camera during a vacation and quickly found that as long as you are outside, in direct sunlight, the camera works fine. However, if you try to take pictures indoor or in the evening, the quality is lacking. The pictures come out dark if at all. Would recommend a different digital camera."
5,Unbeatable ... so far as I've seen,"We've been using this for a few years. Took shots at festivals which have gone into a book we published. It is wonderful for the quality of photos, the SMALL size, the price. I suppose if you paid 10x more you might get something better, but why would I want to do that?... To get more buttons to fiddle with? The point and shoot simplicity, the neat movies it takes. We liked it so much we got three - almost one for everyone in the family."
3,Can't play videos in Linux but good still photos,"Still picture quality is equivalent to $10 disposable cameras from 1997. Just remember that a 1 megapixel digital camera was $1000 in 1997.Still photos are 1248x960 and can be downloaded in Linux, but video can only be downloaded and decoded in Windows. Not a big problem because it only records 30 seconds of video at 624x480 9fps. Can be powered off USB or internal AAA batteries. Has auto shutoff when running on batteries but stays on when powered by USB.Still photos are stored in flash. Video is stored in SDRAM, so you need those AAA batteries to keep your videos from getting erased.Very flimsy, like all Chinese products. Different icons on the LCD panel wink off if you squeeze the case.Not as small as it looks in the picture. Really 1"" deep. Very light, however."
3,Third time is the charm,This is a good album. She has a great voice and has some good material to showcase it on. This album leaves us ready and waiting for more.
4,a good history of elephant-human relationships,"This was a relatively quick read, which managed to succinctly speak to the history of the relationship between elephants and humans. I found it to be a useful book in deepening my understanding of how elephants have been treated by humans. Overall a very informative read. I particularly liked the inclusion of the historical documents."
5,duh......with yogurt!,"I have watched this every year ever since I was a little kid in the 80's. This is a true Christmas classic in my book, and it's just not the Holiday season unless I watch it.For such a short film there is a lot of character development. I love Scrooge's character; even when he's mean, he's funny. Just awesome!"
5,?????,"I ordered this video back in November, its a used item, it arrived in good condition and very clean. I havent tried to watch it because I dont have a VCR but im more than sure that it will play properly. Im giving this to my autistic nephew for christmas. This video was very hard to find brand new so I figured amazon.com would not let me down"
4,A classic tale wonderfully retold with Disney magic.,I remember watching this movie on TV every Christmas-- it was the biggest treat. Disney pixie dust is sprinkled all over. God bless us every one!
2,Broken and missing,"Product came broken and missing one of the brackets to hang it on the wall - not entirely the manufacturers issue, but still should be noted. I'm giving it 2 stars because I did test the strength of the magnet/ease of removing the knives and it seemed like it would have been awesome."
1,"Run, Do Not Walk Away","I never write reviews; however I felt compelled to do so after trying to mount my Henckels magnetic knife strip. After two hours and 4 holes in my wall it is going back. For a company that makes such a high end, refined cutlery product, this magnetic strip is a joke. Heed my advice and save yourself the time, energy, frustration and repair work that goes along with mounting this POS. The mounting brackets are poorly designed, resulting in a loose fit on the wall. This is not an acceptable result when pulling knives on and off of a strong magnetic strip. Go elsewhere for your magnetic knife rack needs, or stick with a block, or the overlooked but well priced kitchen drawer."
1,A beginners guide with nowhere to go,"If you have access to AutoCAD but have no reason to use it on a professional level this book may be fine. If you are purchasing this and already own a couple other manuals to look things up in, it's ok for the humor. The book is not large enough to touch on all the facets of AutoCAD and the massive program it has become. If you intend to make a living with AutoCAD look elsewhere. I watched a co-worker attempt to jump a couple revs with this book. He was better off with his previous knowledge than after three days with this book."
3,2 Discs Out Of 3 Ain't Bad,"This disc contains three documentaries in a series. The first two are very good, and I learned some interesting things that occurred during the war that I had not known, even though I've been studying the subject for ten years now. In the third program of this UK produced series, the British narrator states that Field Marshall Montgomery was the commander of the Allied Invasion Force on D-Day. In fact, there is no mention at anytime of an obscure personality by the name of Dwight D. Eisenhower. In addition, he states that the Americans met with much weaker resistance at Utah and Omaha Beaches (the two bloodiest and heavily defended beaches of the Normandy Coast), than the gallant forces of the UK met with at Gold, Sword, and Juno Beaches. Maybe the books I've read and movies I've seen are pro-American propaganda designed to make us dumb Yanks think that we played a significant part in Operation Overlord, when in fact the British would have won the war without us."
2,"So much potential, so little delivery","This book was not worth the $50 I paid for it. Now that Routledge or Amazon has raised the price even more, well, I am mystified.The book could have been an inspired look at how emerging technologies can and should squeeze more productivity out of an aging infrastructure system. It does that but in the most superficial way, referring to the technologies that the future holds but without an in depth exploration of the technology or the impacted infrastructures the book just isn't worth your time."
3,We're playing in a rock 'n' roll band.,"This is a ""B-side/Remix compilation"" from They Might Be Giants early years. There are some good tracks here, but there are also some rather forgetable tracks. There's a reason that these songs were left off of TMBG's ""real"" albums (other than the four songs here that were featured in different versions on other albums). Like I said, there are some good songs here, but this album is really only for serious TMBG fans."
2,Did Nothing For Me,I thought I'd try this out to help me sleep. Maybe it's psychosomatic or my body isn't attuned to this kind of product (I've never tried anything like homeopathy before) but ultimately I felt no different after taking the tonic.
3,"Cats don't like the taste, but cheaper than Enisyl-F Pump","The description touts the maple as a flavor cats will readily take. Not so! My cats hate the taste. They much prefer the Enisyl-F pump. However, the pump is way too expensive for me. My best recommendation is to get some syringes and do a quick squirt into your cats' mouth. When mine are really sick with FHV, they are pretty docile and it isn't too hard. The secret is to be quick (and try to take them by surprise, if you can. LOL) Good Luck."
5,Awesome,"I have this product for a month now,and it really does work. My arms have gone down alot with rare exercise, when i used this product. I even used it on my back and by back slim down. How crazy is that?????I highly recomend this product."
1,Did Not Work,"Tried this longer than it was recommended, it did not work at all. It did have a plesant smell, but that's all it did."
1,Bad installation,"I just recently purchase war commander and tried to installed it on a brand new cpu out of the box and it install alright but I had a blank screen and I hate game when I cant purchase, install it and play it without changing my sytem around or downloading everything, that was the reason for a new cpu!!!!!!!"
5,Toothpaste.,People actually buy toothpaste online? People are actually so lazy that they can't make a quick trip to the store? Would it be any cheaper to buy used toothpaste? I assume you can buy a toothbrush as well?
5,Functional and efficient,"The item charges batteries expediently and is easy to transport. It is not prone to overheating, a valuable feature in electronics. Also, it arrived in good time."
1,Headset does not work with KRZR K1M...,I purchased these to work a KRZR K1M and both sets of headphones did not work. This listing should be changed and the dealer should exchange them.
1,very uncomfortable bad quality,If you get them to fit in your ears they hurt. If you plan on moving while they are in your ears (jogging) they won't stay. Save your money and don't buy this. When is motorola going to come out with a good headseat for mp3 phones!?
1,"Poor quality, not OEM","This headset fell apart on the first use. The cover on the piece that you press to answer calls came right off. Even though this looks like the OEM headset, it is not. I purchased the real thing from a local electronics store and the quality is much better. I wasted about $7(including shipping) on a useless product."
1,It's All True,"Yes, this is the perfect accessory for the quadriplegic deaf midget. Cord is too short, if you move your jaws (talk) good luck keeping the thing in your ear. The sound quality reminds me of the old AM transistor radios. Worth every bit of the $2.97 that I paid for this thing."
1,The worst accessory for your RAZR!!!,This is THE worst RAZR product I have come across! The product does not function properly. There is A LOT of static and the headset works very sporadically...if at all. If I could give it a ZERO rating I would.Buyer beware.
1,Don't buy this. It broke my phone,"The mechanism that connects to my phone is now broken. I think it broke some pins or something. I'm not sure, but ever since I used the headset I can't charge my phone and use the headset."
1,I don't know if the product works good or not,"I bought the product because I suppously work in my Motorola K1m Cellphone. I doesn't work, so I don't know if it is good or not."
2,for music only - not useful for telephoning,"As a stereo headset, these have NO range, but they are better than nothing (try finding anything with the mini usb connector!) -- So go ahead and use these with your razr as a poor man's (woman's) mp3. But if your phone rings, remove the plug and use the phone itself ... the phone interferes with the sound (mic and ear) with the same buzz you get when a cellphone is placed next to a radio or desk phone. For telephone use, this set is worse than useless. But then again, look at the price - all you are paying for is a cheap set of stereo phones ... and that is all you get! Too bad, b/c the button on the mic enables voice dial, etc. If there is a magic trick to shielding these things short of a lead encasement, I would LOVE to know it!"
1,Does not work with Krzr K1m,"Like all other reviewers with the Krzr k1m phones said, this product does not work with it.I also bought a LG stereo headset for my daughter's LG Chocolate phone. I tried it with the 2.5mm plug adaptor (part # SYN1505A) that comes with the Krzr k1m phone, and the LG headset works great with the k1m. The headset has a volume control, a microphone and a button to answer the phone. When the button is pushed to answer the phone, it pauses the music player. After pushing the button again to end the call, the music player comes back.So, don't buy this for the k1m. The LG headsets with the 2.5mm plug for the Chocolate works with the k1m. I ordered another LG headset for my k1m."
2,not to good,they were good when making calls... but my music was really fuzzy when i played it through them and I know it wasnt my v3xx...
1,Not an option for Verizon-issued KRZR.,"I read the other reviews regarding this headset but decided to give it a shot, since options are limited because of the stupid phone adapter. Even though the KRZR K1m is listed as being compatible with this headset, IT IS NOT ... at least not for Verizon-issued Krzr's. the seller, SF Planet, was wonderful. when i discovered the sound kept coming out of the phone and NOT the headset i contacted SF Planet and they responded right away. they sent another pair ~ along with a postage-paid label to return the original ones. the second pair did not work either. when i told them i have a Verizon Krzr, they said this happened to another Verizon customer as well. Go figure. Be forewarned."
3,"Intersting yes, accesible?, well not to me at least","I have an engiineering degree and an inclination to study mathematics, yet the book demands a level of sophistication that is ver high (at least to me), and the book only has 1 equation!!!! I bought it thinking into would lead me by the hand into the complex land...I find myself working very hard to keep the pace"
2,Some people might like it,"I love to make wacky, ""out there"" characters, and I was hoping that, with bloodlines: hidden being mostly unimaginative templates, I had high hopes for the Legendary. And I was disappointed. I know that many complained about the brevity of the Bloodlines listed in Hidden, and that Legendary was trying to overcome that. However, when most of the fewer bloodlines in this book, less than in hidden, are ridiculous and just plain gross, and not the good kind of gross either. I think my biggest disappointment was the lack of Tremere, which I was hoping would be in this book. There ARE a few exceptions, that are better than even those in (the good ones) in hidden, but overall, it was a disappointment. For those who want more story about a bloodline, this book doesn't disappoint."
5,Amazing Early Reggae,"Few people comment that ""Two Faces Have I"" is one of the earliest songs with a pure Jamaican reggae beat introduced in the USA. Just listen to the organ-- it could be Jimmy Cliff or Bob Marley, both of whom Lou pre-dated in popularity. I wonder if the Lou and Twyla were imitating the Jamaicans or vice versa?? Anyone know?"
1,Lightnin' Strikes Out,"Lugee Alfredo Giovanni Sacco aka Lou Christie was a singer, or should I say ""whiner"" in the 1950's. I don't know who in their right mind would call this ""music"", it's terrible. It sounds like a cat screeching and howling and all the 'songs' sound the same.I'll stick with Alvin and the Chipmunks ."
4,Like the music from this era,"If you enjoy the music of the 80's with a country flavor, you'll enjoy this group.I remember the group when they were first starting out."
1,religious propaganda pretending to be sciene,"Let's be perfectly clear: there is no dilemma among the scientific community regarding the theory of evolution. There are a few people that claim to be scientist, such as Michael Behe does not constitute a true scientific discourse.So, this is a religious debate not a scientific debate.*Embryology is very powerful evidence for evolution*The Fossil record is very powerful evidence for evolution*DNA evidence is very powerful for evolution ( For instance, the DNA evidence that we humans evolved from a primate is overwhelming. Look at the scientific reports that clearly show Human Chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral chromosomes)And it's the synergy of various disciplines is what makes the theory of evolution so strong. With strobel mainly using his high school biology class as reference--it follows this book does not attempt to generate any real intellectual arguments against the theory of evolution"
1,Allow Me to Summarize,"The gist of the argument is ""evolution works in fact, but does it work in theory?""When that argument gets blown away, these folks change the facts or simply ignore the inconvenient ones.I wish all people would understand a few simple points:1. Evolution occurs - no scientist in the world doubts this. Mutation and natural selection are very hard facts. If they are true than we change -- evolve.2. Evolution occurs in humans and is still taking place. See above and see [...]3. Evolution has NO position on the origin of life. None whatsoever. It only kicks in after life begins.4. There is no argument based on religion against evolution. It is neutral on all religious questions. Check with the Pope."
2,DVD Provides real evidence for evolution,"This DVD was amazing in that while it tried to discredit evolution it gave convincing evidence for evolution by showing proof that many creatures have come and gone because they could not adapt to the changing enviroment. I can see why Dawkins called his book ""The God Delusion"". It is now obvious that the very religious will lie and distort science to maintain their delusion of a God that holds their hand and protects them from death. It's like a drug addict stealing money to buy drugs to keep their feel good high. Evolution, molecular biology and organic chemistry take talent and hard work to understand, while a 3 year old can believe in God. Lets' not dumb down America with anti-science flims to support old superstitions."
2,"implausible, but not unpleasant","Dear Ms. King, Divorce was virtually unobtainable in1818. It entailed an act of Parliament (both houses,) required the expenditure of vast sums of money and could be granted only for certain narrowly defined reasons, usually adultery committed by the wife. It was a measure of true desperation, since it guaranteed social ostracism for all parties. Moreover, a pre-marital contract stipulating a divorce 31 days after the marriage would never be legally valid and might invalidate the marriage as well. While the plot is thoroughly implausible, the love story has a certain sweetness, although it is not as well done as it might be."
4,"A classic memoir, it's wonderfully written.","A book that varies between charming and funny and tragic, this book is a treasure. It is beautifully written and should not be missed. It is not condemnatory of Catholicism but it also does not hesitate to be blunt about the realities of her CAtholic childhood."
3,Yes but...,"Well it has some catchy songs for kids.But at least as an adult after you hear a couple it gets boring.Not because of the children singing but because of the music.It's all synthetically done and with no variation,so after a while you just want to turn it off because it's the same.But if you just use it to listen to 1 or 2 songs especially to play for kids,or have them learn a song to sing then it's good."
4,Don't see the instability issues?,"The rack has worked great for us. We use it to transport 3 bikes hundreds of miles at a time. The complaints of instability mystify me. It fits snuggly in our 2"" hitch. I have a hunch some of these folks aren't wrenching it to the hitch. I even lost the little plastic adapter and grabbed an 2"" to 1.25"" hitch adapter from U-Haul...still works great. I also like the way it ties down the bikes, but I'm old fashion and still tie them down with bunges for additional support."
1,Horrible:Boring,"Jay Z is a Vastly Overrated Rapper.also Newsflash to Jay Z:R.kelly is putting a Music Hurting on you, Son. Jay Z is Rufus from the ""Trapped in the Closet"" Movie. the Roots are Vastly Overrated as a Hip-Hop Band. always gotta be carrying the Horse carriage, because there own Music has no Wheels.wack Overrated Acts deserve One another.Jagguar Wright vocally sounds like a Gremlin with that Sad generic Mary J.Bliege tired Voice.very forgettable Album&Corny."
4,Nolte and Coburn ignite this fine film.................,"In Affliction, we see the dark side of a typical American family and what can go wrong when we let our suspicions get the best of us. I liken this storyline to that of Ethan Frome. It's dark and has hardly any light shining through it. It is and honest and real portrayal of what men are capable of doing.I believe Coburn won an Oscar for this one and when you watch this film, you'll see why."
4,Fantastic,I bought this book as a birthday present for a friend. She fell in love with this book. Thank you
5,Spirit-oriented wisdom in an unpretentious package,"I concur with most all that previous reviewers have noted about content, relevance, significance. So rather than repeat those positive and perceptive comments, I will add that David Helminiak's analysis is lucid and honest--candidly acknowledging his personal struggles with traditional and contemporary spiritual practices, his enriching experience of relentless logical reasoning, to discover the radical foundation for human contemplation and insight. He honors radical belief by ackowledging the underlying ground of all being that transcends any mere human notion of what we haltingly refer to as ""divine"" or ""God."" His concluding chapter offers a compelling exploration--lucid and relentlessly logical and therefore powerful--that gracefully pursues this transcendent component of authentic contemplation by the total person's spirit. For me, this final chapter alone is worth far more than the price of the book."
2,Uninspiring,"I wanted to like this book...I really did. But I'm having the hardest time figuring out how to give a fair review without slamming the whole story. The characters are one-dimensional, almost to a fault. Especially Caleb. He made me want to beat his a&# with his 'the world owes me something cause my father walked out on me, my mother died, and my big brother treats me like crap' attitude. Were the women in the story clones of one another? Did we ever truly understand the dynamics that made Austin walk out on his family other than needing his 'space' or his wife not cooking for him one night? I don't think so. Marcus was just a complete wuss. Everything was so predictable. I can understand the writer wanting to shed some light on the epidemic of fatherless children and the emotional turmoil that it entails but in my opinion he falls way short of that mark. A very disappointing and time-wasting read."
2,Don't Believe the Hype!,"I read this book as a selection of my Book Club, Mind & Soul Alliance, and I must say that I was not impressed. This book was hyped up to be as some tell all about why men choose to leave home. It did not do that. Some may say that we are expecting to much by asking one book to give us this understanding but that was one of the main reasons I was looking forward to reading it. The only character that I found of interest was Caleb. All the others, well the Father needed more time in the book, the women were too weak and the other brothers were just plain under-developed. I could not feel the compassion for any of these characters he was trying to excavate. Nice promo job E.Lynn. Good luck to you next time."
4,Worth Having,"The Vogues are a vocal group from the mid-sixties.Strangely enough the liner notes refer to them as a ""garage band"", which I personally fail to see. Their roots are in 50's doo wop but thier hits came later in the mid sixties. They were a AM radio friendly top 40 group but what makes them relevant is that they sang about harder edge themes and not puppy love. Imagine the Beachboys singing the Animals', ""We Got To Get Out of This Place"", and you get a rough idea. As the years move on, they seem to stray from what made them popular because the later songs are covers of 50's doo wop (Earth Angel..ect.) always flawlessly delivered but they adding nothing to the originals, that's why I dropped a star. Still, they made strong music, ""Five O'Clock World"" is a powerfull observation about the human condition and as good or better than anything Bruce Springteen ever wrote."
5,"To tell you the honest truth, it could have been better","This book is really good. It's about a girl named Amber Billows who moves to Hawaii with her family. She makes friends and has fun, but everything is interrupted when Japanese airplanes attack Pearl Harbor.This book could have been so much better, but I still love it anyway, don't ask me why. I liked how the author made it seem how you were right there, and went into detail about stuff. My only complaint is that it could have been longer."
2,Definitely NOT up to Dear America standards . . .,"My grandma got me this book as a sort of early Hanukah present, along with another Dear America book. I must say, this book royally stank.The first fault is the print is so big, it's really only about a quarter as long as the other Dear America books. It was too short to be very enjoyable, and it introduces characters, giving very little information about them. As for Amber's brother, Andy . . . I wasn't sure if he was eight or sixteen until near the end of the book. And it was just too obvious the reason that the dance-thing was on December 7. I think BArry Denenberg can do a lot better, e.g., My Face to the Wind, which was one of my favorites.Also, this book is way too sad. If oyu don't like sad endings, DON'T read this book"
3,Yes Relayer T-Shirt,"Nice T-shirt, just alittle on the thin side. Other then that I would buy another."
3,prison of the dead,If you like zombie movies blood and gore this is one of them actually it did keep me pretty well interrested
1,negative infinity stars }:(,"The movie starts when these annoying yuppies go to a prison. One of the yuppies performs a ritual that's suppose to scare the other yuppies. But it was a joke. OH but the ritual actually DID did raise a whopping 3 zombies from the ground and they hunt down and kill those fools (YES! THEY ALL MUST DIE!!!!!! I ACTUALLY WISH THEY KILLED THEM IN REAL LIFE!!!!!) and turns them into zombies as well. :) So one final yuppie survives the whole thing and that's all! THE END!OK! I HATE THIS FILM WITH SUCH BURNING HATRED!!!! The acting is so annoying, I actually punched the T.V. to try and shut them up!Especially that one yuppie who kept licking his lips (that should tell you something). Everything about this movie is stupid!!!!!!(not many zombies)most entertaining part: when all those yuppies DIE!!!!!!!PEACE, and RESPECT :)"
4,Here She Goes Again,"Christmas music is normally not a good seller but hopefully this one will do well. It's a terrific album from a great lady. Some of these songs are new to me eg. the kickoff song 'Merry Christmas'. As is the title tune which is uptempo and a lot of fun. Bette pairs up with Johnny Mathis (the crown prince of Christmas music). The highlight and surprise is 'From A Distance' which has been totally redone with a Christmas flavour (short bites of Christmas music). She is accompanied by a massive big band. To end this set is a tribute to her Hawaiian heritage. The negative? At approximately 35 minutes, it's much too short.)"
2,Cool Yule Not Bettes Best Tool,"Just another Christmas album. A gift my wife had to have! She listened to it once......ms Midler's voice was wonderful as always. BUT , just another Christmas album"
2,Christmas Bette,Disappointing Christmas album. Why do artists refuse to sing all the classics we love at christmas? Duet with Johnny Mathis saves the album.
3,"Not Bette's Best, but Okay","I collect just about all of Bette Midler's CDs, and I found this this one to be mediocre. It's missing the excitement and panache of her other work."
3,rainy day reading,here's a good weekend novel; does not take a long time to read and captures your attention full-force. one knows something is going to happen and it will be something creepy so one's attention is never diverted by extraneous descriptions and gratuitous verbosity. the characters don't have much dimension (or physical description) but that somehow helps in the success of the suspense. i don't want to reveal anything about the circumstances of this novel; but i do want to suggest it as a good recreational read for those who enjoy a bit of suspense without a lot of violence.
4,Worth your while ;0),"This book is by far an eye-catching book. The title itself sets the feel of the book. Denise Duhamel, Queen for a day is comprised of many of her other well-known poetry books. Duhamel examines sex, marriage, culture, and the poetry industry itself. Duhamel's ironic and yet exotic poem will not just leave you wanting to read more but allows the readers to question the unexpected. Her ability to push the boundaries is astounding. Duhamels also writes about not the typical Barbie's little girls are accustomed to playing with but a different more exotic Barbie. Trust me when I say that you will not be bored in reading this book."
2,Doesn't keep Beer Cold,"This was a xmas gift for my husband, you can feel the cold can when you hold the holder.Thermos always in the pass did it jobs on cold & hot. Guess, nothing is made the way it was long ago."
3,cup cooler,not bad...but not GREAT either...I use an 18 oz reg THERMOS drink holder...and it keeps ice in it even after sitting in my truck for 8 hours....(cost $30) but is Great...these can holders....not even close to the same quality....that being said...they are at least AS GOOD as other holders and probably a bit better...It says 3 hours cooling on side of can...but i notice my drink gettin warmer after about 10 min...
5,Best Coozie I've Had,This coosie is cool. It fits well in your hand. It keeps drinks cold for a long time. The can slides in and out without much effort whilst still holding the can firmly. Temperature on the outside stays the same. There is a nice grip. My grip is a tire grip that is similar to the one on the picture. The bottom is a smooth matte plastic that sets well. I'm using it right now. Good Stuff.
5,If you want a cold one in the sun this is your koozie,"We love these koozies. They can keep a beer (or soda if you drink that sort of thing) drink-ably cool for 2+ hours easy. Comes in handy when you're chasing kiddos around, just wanting a cold one to watch the last quarter of the game or BBQ-ing in the sun for hours on end. We've probably had 20+ requests from friends and strangers to purchase them from us on the spot. The only drawback, which is not a big deal in my opinion, is that some bottles and cans have a slimmer design and don't fit as snug as the ""standard"" can or bottle. Enjoy!"
4,Thermos Stainless Can Insulator,The product was delivered as advertised. For the most part most cans fit snugly in the holder and are kept chilled for a good amount of time. I had one issue with a slimmer can that did not seal but I'd think that's a rare case.
5,Best Can Cooler,"I bought 4 of these 3 years ago at one of my local hardware stores. It is the best can cooler I have ever used. After searching the internet I finally was able to find this to purchase for a friends birthday. It will keep your drink cold a lot longer than any other. Most of the time I would end up throwing out a half can of pop because it would get warm after a couple of hours, I'm not throwing out my pop anymore! It's sleek design have your friends asking where you got it and they want one too. I highly recomend this Thermos product! You won't be sorry, It's well worth the money!"
3,Only missing one thing,Overall not too bad but it was missing the one thing I bought this for in the first place--where was the Cash Money showcase???
5,Very excellent book for better writing,This is a very excellent book for people writing papers for economics.
3,"Good, but Strunk and White...","This is good, but Strunk and White take the cake, decades later. This authors adaption of the formers' rules and advice to economists is good, though."
4,liked it,part of a series love her writing great books if you like romances with adventure or mystrey added in i have more books by her that i love
4,Cute but not that deep,"It's a cute little book and has some interseting suggestions for keeping relationships fresh. I'm not sure that romance is all that hard. It comes down to honesty, communication and a sense of humor."
1,Type II card won't fit most cameras,"I bought this card to use with a Canon S400, but it does not fit in the CF slot. It is a Type II CF Card(5.0mm) most digital cameras take Type I CF cards(3.3mm), which are slightly slimmer. At the time of purchase, the fact that it is type II was not posted on the detail page and the manual was not available. I don't think it's obvious to the layperson what the ""T2"" represents out of ""ST-CF/1GBT2."" It would be nice if it were added to product details or description. Finally, why buy a type II when you can get a 1Gb Type I that fits all CF devices for less money?"
2,Fuzzy Video,"This tape was shot during a live training session..which is good and Palladin does inform you of it with an enclosed note.Video was not very clear and hard to hear, instruction was ok but this is not a video for self instruction. You need a trainer for this as these points apparently are hard to locate and execute so you won't know if your doing it properly unless you have a partner."
4,Relish Life's Small Daily Pleasures,"As the title suggests, Moreah veston has lived an interesting life. Her candid personal essays celebrate her free spirit and inspire the reader to relish life's small daily pleasures."
3,Terrific Voice,"What a voice on this kid !I was nuts for him in 1958,I bought both cd's of his recently.Frankly,I think you have to be a real fan to enjoy the whole album,but he really does have a great voice for such a young kid."
2,Women must learn what is never to be repeated.,"First and formost, my father was in the 6th Marine Recon. Co., and landed on April 1, 1945, and did not leave until it was declared secure,82 days later. I served in H/1/5 in I Corps in '71-'72. The author claims to come from a Marine Corps family. However, she repeats a ""tall tale"" regarding the actions of some Marines, which would be considered 'war crimes"". Such tales should never be repeated, whether they are true, or just cheap talk. I will not justify the lie, and ruin the reputations of all Marines,living and dead. Coming from a Marine Family, the author should delete such lies from the next editions.The Marine Corps has a ledgendary reputation enhanced by mythology. To repeat such stories which the teller obviously mistook for something that never happened, does nothing for the thousands of great Marines.Stay off the Skyline: The Sixth Marine Division on Okinawa - An Oral History"
3,Is mexica better then china ?,"One question i have now that i read the bottom of the filter box saying ""Made in Mexico""We all know ""Made in China"" means it was made good but with bad materials, so results can be OK or horrible depending on what it is, but how about filters ?Doing research i found that mexico's advantage could be the shipping price, but not much talk about quality of the assembly or material quality."
5,OEM - best price,"Great price on a OEM filter. The fram ones look like burned charred remnants after 5k miles. I sometimes look at this one but aside from being dirty it is not warped - makes me feel better that it is hopefully not throwing filter gunk/paper into my engine.I would 100% buy again. Also like that the gasket&oring; are included, I have often had them missing when buying before (maybe someone removed from box?) and it is very annoying, I like to change the housing gasket every time. I do not use the Oring though."
4,I have used Mann filters before on my Mercedes,"Mann filters are indeed same as the original filters from BMW and Mercedes. On my previous 2002 Mercedes C240, I have used a similar (not the same exact part no., of course) Mann filter which was identical to what Mercedes was selling.The last two BMW filters I bought for my 2005 X5 3.0i, I got them from online BMW dealer at the cost of about $10 each. I just ordered 4 of these from Amazon and I believe they are the same filter (OEM) at a reduced cost relative the BMW branded ones."
5,Love these filters,"Best value filter for my six cylinder bimmers. I've used them for over a decade. They have always been well made and they have always come out of the box with the crush washer and the gasket. Consistent, reliable quality at a good price. An easy 5 stars."
2,Junk,"This compilation of songs is, in my opinion a stockpile of junk. The sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. After listening it to it once, I gave the CD away. Enough said!"
5,You won't put it down!,"This book is critical reading material for anyone involved with ""at-risk"" youth. The author takes the reader back to the beginning of each teen's life, and through this we can better grasp how the subjects are where they are today. This would also be an excellent book for parents to read as it is almost a roadmap for raising a child into a disfunctional adult. I was surprised at how many of the teens in the book began their life in a ""normal"" home environment, and with a few changes in the family, that environment was destroyed. I believe this book should be required reading for any college course in which the student's career will involve interacting with children of any age."
2,dull and uncaptivating,I would not call this book a work of fantasy art by any means. The storyline is rather unimaginative and follows the same paths as many fantasy stories written before. It's barely entertaining enough to compel you to read to the end. I finished it out of sheer strength of will.What I want to know is what other works have these other reviewers been reading to find this book such a work of great fantasy fiction? And to even suggest this comes close to a league with Tolkien is blasphemy!
4,Functional and Attractive Clipboard,The product was sent in the time indicated. It isin very good condition and is exactly what was stated in the description. It has ample room for storage of papers and markers with a clip on the front to secure papers in place. It appears to be durable although it really has not been used yet.
3,Arwen is big.,"Thats really the only complaint about this Arwen is that she's taller than all the others,especially Aragorn. Maybe someday a smaller Arwen will come out.........BUT FOR NOW SHE IS THE ONE QUEENUM FOR KINGUM!!!!!!!!"
3,ARWEN RIP OFF!,"This set is good with the huge exception of the Arwen figure. She is a complete rip-off! I have been collecting the figures and was excited to get another Arwen figure and was very upset at what I got. Instead of a new figure, they poorly painted the Galadriel figure's body a sickly green color and stuck Arwens head on it. I love the Galadriel figure, but please. I was pretty annoyed at the quality of this figure. The other four figures however, are very good quality and completely original. Worth it for the 4 figures, but you might as well give Arwen to your dog to chew up."
5,Lefse Stick,Was my first time using the item. Was just as advertised and I enjoyed using it. Thanks for getting to me fast.
4,"4 1/2 - fast, entertaining read","I love the style of the writing team that makes up Libby Street. What a fast, entertaining read. It made me laugh, cry, cringe. I agree with the other reviewer who said it took about 50 pages to get into the book. I put it down several times in the beginning, but was soon sucked in, and stayed up late to finish it. Only thing I couldn't stand was the repeat of the phrase ""modern American female."" All in all, a good book."
1,oh please...,"I bought this by mistake-thought I was buying book of same title by Lolly Winston...what a disappointment. These 20-something novels are something else...boo hoo hoo...life isn't perfect, but wait-then suddenly it is! Give me a break...I know it is fiction but don't readers want some real life in their books anymore??Maybe not...that might require thinking..."
4,This one will be fun to read to a class.,"I don't think it is the best Chinese New Year book on the market, but I can't wait to see the looks on my kindergartner's faces when I pull open the book to show them the Chinese dragon!"
1,awful kitsch,"Hamilton offers only stock characters & stereotypical incidents. This skims the surfaces but gives little sense of lived experience, in spite of the author's background. Though filled with equal measures of sex and violence, the novel simply fails to engage the reader, in spite of the promising early pages.Readers seeking a richly written, thoroughly gripping and truly authentic portrait of the Middle East, should turn to Robert Stone's wonderful novel ""Damascus Gate"" instead."
3,"Enjoyable read, from a reliable source","Although the writing and subject matter isn't as good as some of her other books (See Rage: A Love Story, those looking for a serious angst-ridden abusive emotion-fest), I did enjoy this book and will continue to recommend this author to young and old adults.See my full review here: [...]"
1,I HATE THIS PHONE!!!,"THIS IS THE REASON I AM NOW HAVING TO LOOK FOR A NEW ONE... CHARGERS SUCK!! THEY KEEP BREAKING ON ME LEFT AND RIGHT....NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH NEW PHONES UP UNTIL NOW.. I MEAN, I'VE ONLY HAD IT LIKE 4 MONTHS!!"
1,Save your money!,"This book was a complete disappointment!Three of the ""detoxes"" where just one sentence. The author divided a massage into body parts so she could turn it into ten different detoxes instead of listing it as one detox method.Ditto for food--fresh fruit and dried fruit are counted as two different detoxes and eating vegetables is a third detox. Vegetable stock is a fourth detox. By the time she was done dividing up food and drink they made up 18 of the 50 detoxes. Of the 18 ""detoxes"" only five gave any kind of recipe. The other 13 just listed one of two of the good qualities of the different foods.Basically, the author took some detox methods and split them up as much as humanly possible. Then added a bunch of pictures to take up room and called it 50 Natural Ways to Detox."
3,Mind Your Head!,"Holdsworth is electronic in the best sense of the term. But unlike the ""solo until the cows come home"" mentality of much of the post Van Halen school of electric guitar, Holdsworth is a master of knowing when to hold back on the notes, or go all out. Listen to his solos in ""Rukukah"" (I think that's how you spell it!) and ""Low Levels, High Stakes"" to see what I mean. Unfortunately, some of the material here is not up to the standard of Holdsworth's playing (The title track seems to be curiously underdeveloped, while ""Tuillio"" is the latest entry of a long line of ""another day at the office"" type jazz.However, the excellent performances of his supporting players manages to lift much of the less than perfect material. Bassist Skuli Sverrisson does a great solo in ""Low Levels"". Well worth a listen if you like lots of electric guitar."
2,Not so memorable,"This is really not such a good book. It is mainly a series of quotations from other sources. In my opinion, the best book about Augusta is David Owens' book. Curt Sampson's book is interesting, but has many factual errors, and reads like a next to last draft in need of a thorough fact checking. In any event, save your money on this one."
3,"be careful, not a product for daily usage","The stools look pretty, no doubt. But they are flimsy and cheap. The bars on top which hold the seat broke already several times since the used material is too thin. Our chairs are used by normal people in our office none of them is heavyset. We had to weld it multiple times to make it work again. Also the bearings are somewhat flimsy and make terrible noises when you turn around seated on the stool."
5,Cooler,This is a very weird size cooler but it worked great for me in my application where size was important
1,Use your common sense instead,"this is an easy read. if that is all you are looking for, then yes, buy the book. the book gives stories on how friends helped with the food, the pictures, the place, the flowers, etc. if i had someone to give me the food as a gift, sure, i could do a wedding under 5K. a few ideas, but instead of buying the book, check it out at your local library. anyone could tell you to keep your list small to save money. have friends bring food to save money. hire your uncle to take pictures. if ms. kennedy is a caterer, than we should be able to hire her for under 5K."
2,Not very helpful at all......,"The only useful things it said are (a) that small weddings are cheaper so keep your guest list small (duh!) and (b)that you should decide on the 5 things that you absolutely can't give up and be willing to sacrifice anything else if needed.There were sample budgets from real life couples but they weren't very helpful. Most of the stories were about how the bride and groom had family members and friends chip in - a friend who is a photographer took the pictures, another friend baked the cake etc. If you don't have talented friends and family - this book isn't helpful.One bride and groom were able to keep their expenses low because her brother donated the food and beverages at the reception. Well the food at the reception was still paid for by someone so it wasn't really a wedding for less than $5000. The title should be ""how to get other people to pay for your wedding""."
3,Just OK,"I didn't think this book was all that great. It did have some good information, but nothing that I hadn't already read on a wedding website or in a magazine. The information contained in this book is useful if you are on a budget, but like I said, you can get the same information on many websites."
5,great item,"bought this for my 2 year old great nephew, his dad is a firefighter, it was love at first sight. keeps him occupied when he seats at the table to eat, plus they use it when he does crafts to protect the table, washes clean"
1,Doesn't hold its shape,"My initial thoughts were to get a bed rest without any frills like heaters, massage or lighting. The Bedlounge seemed like it fit my requirements. My first mistake was to order the optional lumbar pillow. It's an overpriced pillow that is very similar to what you find on an airplane for free. I removed it immediately and never used it again. My next mistake was not to return this product immediately.The Bedlounge does its job for a few months and then the armrests loose their support ability. If you look at the picture, it shows the armrests perpendicular (90 degree angle) to the surface. After only a few months of use, mine are almost flat to the surface -- providing little arm support.There is a warranty that says the it covers the inner support not breaking. I'm fairly sure nothing has broken; rather, is has simply reshaped itself into a useless position. I'm very unhappy with this purchase and would not recommend this product at any price."
4,Lijoi is a Joy,"I met Ernie in a rather informal setting and found him to be a great guy. Then I got to hear him perform. I was hooked! His words are meaningful, his music is fun and his voice is excellent! Although some may say this album is not his 'best' work, I totally enjoy the acoustic folk sound. ""Chandler Street"" has to be one of the most poingant songs I've heard in a long time. His subsequent albums are even better, proof that some things get better with [a little] age."
4,I like this but...,"I don't know if its me, but i cant get any clean sound when this pedal is on, i use this for booster, really sounds good! use it too when i want to get feedback from my amp.also it comes with an anti slip sticker that you can put underneath the pedal.i recomend this one."
4,"Squishy, Simple, and Sweet","I've tried several compressors, but the MXR Dyna Comp finally made me stop looking. It adds a bit more color than some players like, but I want my compressor to have some flavor. It works okay as a clean boost, but it shines with the Sensitivity at about 3 o'clock. The two ways I use it are to add sustain to my slide playing and to tighten up my tremolo picking. With slide, it adds a nice, glassy sustain, though the Bent Soundlabs modded Boss CS-3 I had previously was a bit better in this function. For tremolo picking, the Dyna Comp is champ. It makes my picking sound distinct and round, really accentuating my playing style. It does get noisy when the Output is turned past 3 o'clock, but I seldom need that much volume. It is also useful for adding volume and tightness to octave effects, like the MXR Blue Box. If it was a little quieter at high volumes, it would get 5 stars. As it is, the Dyna Comp is the best value in compressors."
4,Excellent Drawings !,"This is an excellent pictoral reference covering a nice diversity in tanks. Like all book that are an overview it has gaps and is not exhaustive in any particular catagory.The drawings are well done and look nice. They are not 3-view format so the views are limited. Coverage of allied tanks is good but there is a very large amount of drawings centered on French Tanks of the later war years - so you have many US vehicles not in US markings but in French. A plus for those interested but a bit frustrating for those wanting more US coverage. Well worth the price - it is a nice color guide. You will get no information on tank types, specifications or histories ........ this is a color guide - no more. In that limited range - it does well."
5,Sales Management gem,"I read this book on my last business trip. The principles inside are excellent keys to motivating a sales team. However, I also have used them on my family with outstanding results. Bringing out the best in others is a book that I wish I had read years ago. Over the next few months I expect to be happier. Not just from reading this book, but applying the principles. Why, because it reaps rewards back to anyone who understands and uses the three principles. As a national sales manager, I'm recommending this to anyone who works with a sales team. Although it will be a great addition to anyones library who wants to increase positve change in people and themselves."
5,Amazing Album,"I can't praise this album enough. I don't know what the reviewers(the ones who dissed the album) were looking for, but I have both albums and I think this one is as good or better than her first album. Some might argue that this album is more of the same, but in Mindy Smith's case, that is a very good thing. Her vocals are awesome and the lyrics on ""Out Loud,"" ""Edge of Love"" and ""Tennessee"" are especially touching. Excellent album!"
4,Beautiful!,"Wonderful songs in a folk/pop/acoustical mix that works on many levels. Mindy's voice is just beautiful. (Think: Shawn Colvin) The lyrics tell stories, the songs are all unique."
4,The first Fifth Doctor story,"Following on immediately from the Doctor's regeneration at the end of 'Logopolis', the Doctor and his three companions are being approached by the security guards of the Pharos Project, and the Master is also still present. Nyssa and Tegan help the semiconscious Doctor into the TARDIS, but Adric is captured by the Master. The Doctor's regeneration is unstable, and he is placed in the Zero Room, which will assist with his recovery. But the TARDIS is on a new course for the Big Bang, which will destroy it...A satisfactory follow-up to 'Logopolis', with all the companions and the Doctor's new incarnation all with things to do. If I have a complaint, it is that the Master's plot is seemingly too complex.Christopher Bidmead's adaptation of his own script is very good."
2,A homely bowl,I am not real happy with this bowl. I didn't realize how small it was. It is really sort of homely! The inside should have been a pale green to match the blue pistoulet set that it is supposed to be a part of. Too pricey for what it is!
1,Terrible Blu-Ray Production,"Burn Notice is such a wonderful show! Season Two was shot and broadcast in HD and looked awesome on my HDTV when it was aired. So how is it possible that FOX did such an inept job in transferring it to Blu-Ray? The scenes are grainy, sometimes out of focus and I swear I saw artifacts. Hands down, these are the worst Blu-Ray discs I own. My standard discs of Season One look ten times better than Season Two. Don't waste the extra money on Blu-Ray! Buy the standard DVD's."
3,"Great show, disappointing Blu-Ray execution","I love the show, so this review isn't about the show itself. I've not seen all of the episodes yet, but so far, the definition seems to be of the standard variety, even though this is a Blu-Ray set. I'm wondering if I shouldn't have just paid for the regualar DVD set. Images are grainy, not crisp as you would hope from a Blu-ray version..."
5,Smartest Show on TV,"Everything that's wrong with action shows today Burn Notice gets right. Filled with a stellar cast, witty and genuine writing, a myriad of ingenious gadgets and plans (that would really work in real life), and plot twists that'll make your head spin, Burn Notice guarantees to captivate its audience down to the credits. But what really amazes me about this show is the depth of the characters and the heart behind the mayhem."
3,excellant series,"ONLY problem was, ""Incorrect Region"" version was sent,SO can only watch it on computer screen.But a great, FUN, series."
5,Good Work!!,"Contrary to what the others said, I found the book complete. I was reading the process of 'Dephasing in semiconductors' and it was thoroughly described. But by no means, it serves as an introductory text (as the title says). You need to be an advanced reader already having enough experience with quantum transport."
2,Where are the examples?,"This book contains a somewhat disjointed overview of SQL*Loader. It starts to explain something and then shows one little example of a character column, for instance. But then there is nothing at all about what to do if the column is a number or date. It explains a lot but it shows little. A very frustrating book.Oracle's SQL*Loader is fragile, counter-intuitive, dated, and hard to work with. If there were ANY other books available, I would try one of those instead."
3,The DMZ,"The DMZ by Jeanette Windle is an interesting story about the cold war in Columbia. Jeanette definitely did her homework. The book is thoroughly researched ... a note on the back stated that government agencies have actually questioned her to make sure she hadn't received classified information. The plot is deep with plenty of twists throughout. I will say that this isn't exactly the style novel that I normally choose to read. So ... I'm sure others will really enjoy it ... it just wasn't exactly for me. (The other reviews on Amazon were really positive, so check those out.)I received a free copy of this book from Litfuse Publicity in exchange for my fair and honest review."
1,poorly laminated world map,This wall map was only laminated on one side of very thinpaper. I was disappointed in the quality of a map that sold for[price]! It would have been reasonably priced at $1 or $2 tops!
4,at home in my library,I picked up this album after songs from it kept showing up on my Pandora stations. And I'm glad I did. These guys have an exceptional combination of musical talents. Highlight of which (imo) are the talents of their drummer. He lays down some incredibly difficult and earth moving rhythms for the rest of his bandmembers to anchor themselves to. Check this record out. It's good stuff!
4,"Great Table, Great Price","This table is easy to set up and easy to use. My only complaint is the head cradle only has one adjustment lever for both height and tilt. Others may find this easier, I'm just used to the dual levers. The bolsters don't fit ""inside"" the table for transport, but this is also minor as you get a carrying bag. The bag has a nice shoulder strap and handle for extra leverage while carrying."
4,Good price and comfortable.,This item is very sturdy and comfortable. We were hoping we could store it under our bed but it was a little to thick. Hides nicely behind clothes in closet though. The bolsters they mention and picture did not come with it and we are having problems contacting anyone from Amazon that can help. Any suggestions? Would have rated this 5* if they would have been there as advertised.
2,Terrible experience purchasing online,"Giving two stars since I never actually received the table so this is just for the service. Table showed as available and ordered it. Waited for two weeks only to be told that they had to cancel the order because they didn't have it in stock. However, Amazon still shows it in stock."
4,Nice table,Very comfortable with ample space. Easy to fold up. I only wish it had a better support area for your arms when your in prone.
2,I should have listened to another rater.,I like them a lot at first and did use them a lot in the summer months; but after a year they started leaking.
5,The ice pack that's really Icey,"At first $16 seemed really steep for an ice pack. Once i received it and started using it I realized that $16 to relieve my pain was very worth it. The product materiels feel soft, pleasing, and yet durable. My ice pack has plenty of cold material and only takes about 2 hours in the freezer to do its job for about a half hour on my lower back. I've used ice packs that only last about 10 minutes after 24 hours of refridgeration, so this one really does do the trick. I know other reviews and the instructions say not to do this but i sometimes lay on the ice pack directly and it has held up beutifully (KNOCK ON WOOD) and i am a 6ft 250 pound guy. The product works as promised and whats even better is that it covers my entire lower back. Best $16 i ever spent."
5,COLD . . . .,I purchased this to use after a knee replacement surgery. It works great. You are only suppose to use Ice or cold for approx 20 minutes and this works perfect and it gets really cold. I bought another one for a friend to use after her knee surgery. I like the size as it covers a large area at one time verses using a ice bag.
2,Seam ripped after 4 months,"Initially, I loved this ice pack. It is large enough to ice any area of my body. Shoulder front and back at the same time and lower back and hip. However, today one of the seams just opened up with no stress on it. I have emailed the seller and will update if and when I hear back. Four months use is pretty poor."
3,Colpac heavy on shoulder,"Recovering from Rotator Cuff Surgery and being a 150 pound weakling, the 11 X 14 inch Colpac is very heavy on my shoulder. It freezes well and makes the area very cold in 15 -20 min. This is good. But I wish it would not be such a heavy weight on what is a rather fragile shoulder."
1,Contains alcohol,"Realized after I received the product that it contains isopropyl alcohol, which would actually dry out and irritate the dog's skin and exacerbate the dander. The ingredients really should be listed in the product description. Didn't find it very effective either. Returned product."
5,dander remover for dogs,I like the products from this company. My friend is allergic to dogs and she uses this product and it seems to work for her.
3,"Its ok, but not the best","It does work to tackle some odors, I dont think it stops dander. All in all I wont order again, if I want something similar I will get a deodorizing shampoo."
1,DONT BUY IT !,"I HAVE WIN XP AND THIS PROGRAM FREEZES UP YOUR ENTIRE SYSTEM! UNLESS YOU ARE TECH SAVY, AND YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE TO GO TO FIND OUTDATED SOFTWARE UPGRADES FOR THIS COMPANY THEN I WOULD AGREE THAT THIS WOULD BE A GREAT PROGRAM IF IT WORKED. THE LESSONS ARE EASY TO UNDERSTAND BUT THE CONTENT WILL STOP AND MAKE THESE REALLY ANNOYING SOUNDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LESSON- THE GUY THAT GAVE IT A 5 STAR IS PROBABLY TECH SAVY OR A SALES REP FOR THE COMPANY- THIS WILL FRUSTRATE THE PARENT WHO JUST WANTED TO GET A TUTORIAL FOR THEIR KID."
5,Love it!,This can never be played too much! Any time of the day works - it is BEAUTIFUL! Simply BEAUTIFUL!
5,Great story from the ones close to him,"Been a Biggie fan since the day he came out and was pleased to watch this. No real music performances, but great story, narration and discussions about the greatest rapper on this earth. A few great and never seen before clips that were good to see. The stuff you hear on this DVD will make you think. And the whole east-coast west-coast beef was something that should have never happened. The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac were friends until mistakes and assumptions were made.Biggie will always be the best for many reasons. R.I.P Notorious B.I.G."
3,It's okay...not the best.,"This capo is really just adequate for me. I mean, it does the job...just not well enough for my liking. I play a Takamine EA10C and find that this capo works fine...on four of the six strings!...I tend to always have buzzing with this capo on both the B string and high E string no matter what fret its on or how I position it...Bottom line, I'd just get a Kyser or Shubb. Both work MUCH better."
4,"Efficient, effective, but careful how you handle it!","A very useful tool for the guitarist. It works great with my Ibanez. Just be careful how you handle the thing, lest it slip out of your fingers and goes flying across the room. The spring has a LOT of tension already in it."
2,Works but it's too strong,"It serves the purpose but it's too tense, applies too much pressure to the fretboard, needs too much strength to install and it makes tuning go sharp. Every time I use it I have to pretty much retune the 6 strings, defeating the purpose of the capo itself. In order to use it live I had to bring two guitars to the stage, I usually play DGCFAD so the second guitar had the capo in the second fret to make it standard E Tuning but I had to tune it before the show to guarantee good pitch. When my main guitar snaped a string, I had to use the one with the capo, remove the capo and then retune the 6 strings for it to be in tune.All in all, I advise you buy the Planet Waves NS dual or tri action capo."
4,A good product..,"This is a replacement. I already have one. Pressure (strings) on the upper rubber pad will eventually cause indentations. Never leave this on an instrument after playing. Memory effect.Price was good at $12 plus $3 shipping.This is a good quick release capo and is quite popular.Keyser makes a good one as well.I have never tried the strap on type..they prob take longer attach, move and remove."
3,"Not bad, not Great","I've been playing guitar for over 10 years. I bought this because it was a good price, and had mostly good reviews.This capo gets the job done, however I feel like the tension is a bit too strong for my liking. It just isn't all that convenient and easy to quickly put on or move. I've owned other capos in the past that were much easier to quickly get on the exact spot.This capo won't damage your guitar or anything, but my recommendation is spend a couple more dollars and buy one that's easier to move around."
5,Operacion 67 is dynamite! Don;t drop it!,"What an action packed movie! As good as any Bond film . Santo is at his best in action and comedy as he works very well with Jorge Rivera. As per usual in any spy film , pretty girls and don't miss the dance sequence of the beautiful Midori Nagashimo! It's a great blend of action , thrills , comedy and of course El Santo who shines in his performance!"
2,Dissapointing,"After the brilliant ""Go Now"", ""Godlike"" clocks in as one big dissapointment. Sure the writing has more 'craft' now, but the storytelling is scattered, and the flipping between multiple viewpoints and time frames succeeds only in making the pace drag, and the - rather simple - plot seem convulted and messy.Whereas ""go Now"" was full of life and great writing, Godlike is cold and rather boring. You dont paticularly care for what happens. You are very aware that Hell is trying to stretch out as a writer and conquor new ground, but the book is a pretty staid, academic exercise.I was really looking forward to this book, but I struggled to finish it once I got it."
1,An Inaccurate Translation For A Politically Correct Age,"The New Living Translation is sold as a modern bible for the rest of us who have difficult with half-a-millenium old English. Unfortunately, it fails to live up to its billing. While the language is modern -- it abandons all pretense with regard to telling the reader what the original autographs actually said. Its use of dynamic equivalence in translation is suspect, as is the motivation and views of those that created it.A far superior alternative: the New King James version, by far the most accurate modern language bible available today."
5,Great price,"This is a really good price for this litter! As long as they don't kill you in the shipping, I recommend buying this. I think that this litter works best if you just put a few scoop in each corner of their litter box (because they only go in corners) and change the litter out every day. This way, you are not wasting litter in the middle of the box, and by changing every day, you reduce unwanted smells :)"
4,Packing Book,"This has been fantastic book to read in order to pick up strategies for packing lightly. The author does a great job illustrating both with pictures and with words just how to pack efficiently for all types of travel from business to vacation to family trips, and her methods work. There is also a helpful resource list in the back for travel clothing and gear. The only reason I did not give this book a 5-star rating is because it has not been updated since before greater travel restrictions have been applied and enforced in U.S. airline security."
5,The Best book of 2007,"This book is adorable, My three and one and half yr old love it!! What a simple story that can be applied to everyday eating frusterations.If you don't have it, buy it! I got it from the libary had to have a copy for ourselves, we read it every night!!!"
5,LOVE it!,"Love the illustrations, love the story. It is a new favorite gift to give all the munchkins in our life."
2,A little disappointed.,"I have purchased these crackers numerous times and they are always good. We eat a lot of them so I buy in large quantities. The problem this time was that I purchased 1 box of wasabi crackers and several boxes of cheese crackers on Nov. 18th. The sell by date on the wasabi was June of 2010 but the cheese date was Feb. of 2010. Had I known this I would not have bought as many of the cheese. I do not see that there is any way for me to know the sell date, is there?? On every other occasion the sell by date has been reasonable and we have been pleased."
5,Childhood sweetness of the 80's!,I LOVE this dvd for myself and my two year old daughter! I remember watching this episode on tv when I was a child.It comes with two short episodes. It's awesome! A must buy!
2,Disappointing,"I was really excited about this product because water runs under my garage doors when it rains - even though there are rubber seals on the bottom of the doors. I followed the directions closely and applied three beads of liquid nails as instructed. During the first rain, there was a little water at either end of the doors but I thought the water just went around the threshhold seal. However during a following rain, water ran under the threshold seal."
1,This is not a music album,"OK, maybe I should have known this when I ordered this CD, but it is not a music CD. I didn't see anything in Amazon's listing to clue me in to that. Someone had recommended his music to us and we decided to try it out. When we received this we found out that it was a biography."
3,A Bit Sketchy,"The American vinyl version of this album is a rather good collection of YMO tracks. This CD is the original Japanese album, and is rather short on ideas. ""Nice Age"" is perhaps the most commercial pop/rock song the band did, and it's very good. The (never-ending) version of ""Tighten Up"" is cute, ""Multiplies"" is goofy fun (trivia note - impress your friends by pointing out the quoting of ""Sweet Soul Music"" and ""I Second That Emotion"" at the start of the track), and ""Citizens of Science"" is decent pop. There. That's all the songs on the album (""End of Asia"" is a quick remake of a song on Sakamoto's ""1000 Knives"" LP)."
1,Better toys on the street,This toy is such a disappointment! I could have bought the same thing from a street vendor for one dollar. Please don't waste your money like I have.
3,A Gift That Was Fun,I bought this for my great niece as a gift. I only know that she loved it and played with it a lot when she got it.
3,So far so good,"This isn't the most quality toy, especially since it's for kids and kids can be tough on things. I agree with the previous review that the ""meow"" is more like a chirp than anything. It's a cute toy but I'm glad I only paid $9.00 for it. It's not worth much more."
3,Changing bag,"I just bought this for my daughter to go with her babydolls. It's neat because it makes her feel more responsible when she can carry her baby's ""needs"" around with her. I know it's supposed to respond to one of the Chou Chou dolls, but we don't have that doll, we just use it with our regular dolls."
2,very disappointing Junior...,"Loving the remix work of Junior, as well as some of his other singles, I picked this one up without hesitation. What a waste of time. I've tried listening to it a couple of times, the dub starts out ok, but then falls flat. Do yourself a favor, buy his other stuff, skip this one."
4,"Does the job, cute","This walker has been fine for our learning-to-walk 10 month old. The back wheels are locked into a forward facing position, so it doesn't maneuver as well as our old one, although maybe there is a safety reason for this. The music seems a bit loud and annoying to me, but the kids like it. The lowest setting (of 3) is barely where my baby can reach the floor with his feet, but, as we all know, this will change overnight! Good walker."
1,batteries can not be replaced,my son loves all the lights and sounds but this walker is not as much fun once the batteries die. I have only used it for a few months and the batteries are already dead and they can not be replaced. If you child likes the sounds you might want to find one with replaceable batteries. other than that the walker is fine for the money and folds up nice for travel.
3,Needs more height adjustment settings... only two.,"My daughter is 5 months old and can barely reach the ground with her tippy toes on the lowest setting. I saw that this is height adjustable, but little did I know it only has two settings and both of them are extremely tall. It says 4months and above so I figured that it would be talking about average babies but its definitely too tall and Mylinn is a little longer than normal. The toys are simple but thats fine especially for the cheap price we paid, but what good is it if she can't reach the ground to walk in it. The product itself is great I think, exactly as described, but they need to include a height minimum for this or more adjustable settings."
2,Batteries not replaceable,"We bought this toy at a consignment store, so there's no telling how much it was used before being sold. The batteries began to die the week after we bought it. I never bothered changing them because DD didn't care about the music and lights anyway. I just sat down 10 minutes ago to change the batteries to resell the item at another consignment event and discovered that they can't be changed! Whatever size batteries are required are located INSIDE the steering wheel, which is not meant to come apart. I've read reviews on other sites that suggest once you open the steering wheel, you find that they are soldered into place. This is simply unacceptable in a toy that has sound and lights!! I'm happy I only paid ten dollars for it in the first place, but those paying full price should be wary."
1,Too tall,"My baby has normal height but still doesn't fit in this walker and the music is really too loud, will definitely return it!!!"
2,"too tall, wheels get choked with fur","My 50 percentile 6 month old couldn't touch the ground in the lowest setting. Since we had bought this used, and couldn't return it, I took my dremel and cut some new notches. That worked great. The wheels were ok on the carpet and the tile. They aren't super smooth, but how fast do you want your baby scooting around the house? The biggest problem is that we have a dog, and the dog fur clogs the wheels and there is no way to clean the wheels out. I finally found a caster wheel supplier that had small enough wheels that fit, but it took 2 weeks to ship and the wheels cost more than I paid for the walker ($20). If you have pets, look for a walker with wheels that you can get the fur out of the axle. I didn't see any at babies R us or walmart though, so good luck."
3,suitable for the price,"We purchased this walker mainly because it is half the price of similar walkers. I have the same complaints as many other reviewers: My son cannot reach the floor yet even on the lowest setting even though he is 7 months old and 27inches tall. Also the ""music"" is sooooo loud and tinny that it scared my son to death! He was very happy just sitting in it and playing with the toys but as soon as I turned on the music he started screaming. I think that once he can reach the floor he will enjoy it though. So, to sum up, its probably a great walker but like other reviewers said, the music/lights portion is worthless."
5,Great book,"Just finished this great little book last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. Steven's depiction of his ancestors, the reality of their doubts about the goodness and plans of the Lord and yet perseverance to push on to obtain character and hope that does not disappoint, I'm sure, characterized his own personal struggle over the last 20-30 years. Through all their struggles, losses, awful death and carnage, they believed that God was in control... they might not know the reason why something happened... but that's ok, cuz that's why God is God and we're not. May I be able to describe to my children and grandchildren as well as he did what their ancestors and forefathers were like and have them relate or hold fast to those precious roots. As you are reading the book, you may want to access his website ... to see pictures of his real ancestors and what happened to them after the Civil War. I would highly recommend the book to any reader"
4,Not as catching for my 2 year old.,"I bought three Wiggles cassettes so far: Wiggle Time, Toot Toot and Wake Up Jeff. This is an excellent cassette, but it does seem to get my kid's attention as much as the other two. I see that the other reviews talk about this cassette for older kids so maybe I should wait and see. It is a nice cassette for my 2 year old but not as much as Wiggle TIme and Toot Toot."
1,Not as good as it sounds!,"Nicest looking humidifier, by far with the nightlight. A little complicated to put together - But after 30 minutes, it all made sense. It works perfect in my small 12X12 bedroom. When we put in our great room 20X15, never puts out more that 30% on the humidity level gauge. Room still feels dry. After a week, It really needed cleaning completely, lots of hard water residue.I am going to return it."
1,very unsatisfied,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my mom. I was so excited for her. She was so happy when I gave it to her on her birthday, October 18. Well, so much for that happiness. Today is November 6,2010, I am still waitng for a refund on the product. The Electronic Bible had a line running through it right through the middle of the screen! I called the manufacturer ,they stated it was missing pixels! I returned it to oksuperstore...still waiting for refund!Very unsatisfied..and my mom is still without a birthday gift..how embarrasing!"
3,A good start to volume two but a strange detour into the kitchen.,"The second volume in this combination Space Opera-Romance starts out well, but soon drifts into way too many moments in the kitchen preparing food and eating and drinking instead of actual, meaty story."
1,HORRIBLE,"This product made my puppy throw up all day, i had to take her to the vet. Do not recommend this product its just made up of sugar and lard. she wont even eat these anymore. DO NOT BUY. it will harm your dog"
5,Wonderful barroque music !!!!!,"I have the wonderful LP feature of it. I feel sorry every time I reproduce it. However, the interpretation of the concerts is celesial and therefore had to purchase the CD version and keep the LP version. These are interpretations infinitely desirable ...."
4,It Don't Slip!!,"The Sling will hold your rifle in place while hiking and climbing up hills with no problem! I only have 1, and I just switch it from gun to gun!"
2,Quite a disappointment,"Dead Inside is a flat, immature version of Pure, one of my favorite discs and the best Palomino release to date. This is odd as it came out two years after Pure was released. Dead Inside is dark in tone, almost a goth feel to much of it, with too much bass (though some interesting rythyms) and it seems poorly mixed. The songs are all about the misapperception and abuse of power in our relationships with ourselves, with others, and with our urban environments. Most of it is fairly sophmoric, as if the group forgot all the Bataille readings that led them to write the haunting lyrics of Pure.The album is worth a listen, but it isn't one to own."
5,Totally Great Book!,"The steps at the end of this book are WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD!In a few short weeks I have put an end to so much manipulation in my life. It takes the wind right out of the manipulator's sails. The book is right...the manipulator will blow really hard, so prepare yourself; it's going to get stormy.It's worth it if you can hold to your purpose. It's great to get back some self-respect and strength of character.This is a great book...where has it been all my life? I really appreciate the help in figuring out all the fog that people cloak their behaviors in when they are trying to persuade you with emotional force.I especially appreciate the examples on adult-parent to adult-child pressure."
2,okay,"it was alright,nothing too specialthe irony is the authors manipulates the reader throughout the book,its really not more than just a self help book"
3,It has some helpful tools,"I will give it that, that there is helpful tools. It gives you different scenerios of manipultive situations. And It truly opened my eyes to everything around me. But the author seems to just keep repeating herself so much that it's make it hard to stay focused on."
3,Dissapoinment,"As a long time fan of The Dead Milkmen, I was really disappointed by this release. Stoney's Extra Stout does contain some incredibly solid, and hilarious tracks, but not like the old days. I guess everyone needs to re-invent their sound after awhile, but I wish The Dead Milkmen had stayed with their Punk roots. Although this album is fairly good, it by no means compares to their earlier albums. If your a fan of these old-school, Philly kids like myself, then it is a must have. However, if your merely looking for a new sound, I suggest one of The Dead Milkmen's other albums."
2,There once was a library...,"Honestly, if you buy this, you are wasting your time. In my opinion, the man is an absolute master; at the same time, clearly not for everybody. But why would you buy this sampler to find out? Go to the library and read some of his short stories - start with ""The Elephant Vanishes."" Or just pick up one of his novels. The excerpt of ""Wind-Up"" here is only slightly representative of the text as a whole.If you buy this, you will either A) like his writing, buy some of his books, and never need this again, leaving it to mold on your shelf, or B) dislike his writing, and never need this again, leaving it to mold on your shelf.And the ""rarity"" can easily be found online.It gets two stars, instead of zero, because even a tiny amount of Murakami in your life is a good thing. But really - don't spend your money here."
3,"Great book, lousy packing job.","Affordable, shipping a little slow.And the book was damaged when I got it, almost split in the middle for a flimsy envelope."
4,Nice inexpensive canister vacuum!,"Bought Panasonic MC-V3900 canister vacuum cleaner. Quite satisfied. It is light,have a strong vacuum, and inexpensive.Also uses a bag which I require-don't have to deal directly with the messy dirt.I use it specifically with my hardwood floor which it nicely cleans up easily.I would recommend it!"
4,BACKS UP ROOMBA ROBOT VACUUM,"Thia vacuum backs up a robot vacuum which doesn't do edges of floors well nor does it have attachments. I agree with previous reviews about the lack of a duster attachment and the loud noise. I had a previous vacuum duster that fit and I use industrial ear protectors even for my blender, so these negatives did not prevent my purchase. It is very light weight, stores in a small space, and easy to set up for use."
5,nice for the price,"while by far not the trendiest or most luxurious of the NINE strollers I own, for the price I paid for it it is probably the best value. It folds down easily and while not exactly compact once it's folded, it at least stands on it's own. The parent cupholders seems small - maybe big enough for a slim bottle or a mcdonalds happy meal cup... other than the kind of bulky size and the small cupholders, I really can't complain. It seems well made and solid."
4,Actually-make that 4 1/2 stars,"I cannot believe that I'm the first person reviewing this disc. I bought it in 1994 the second I heard it. ""Please Don't Ask"" is pure Husker Du, only more so. Every Huskers fan is searching for the perfect balance of the big three components...songwriting, attitude, and noise(for lack of a better term). This album has IT in spades, every track could be a classic in its own right. If your neighborhood garage band sounded one percent as good as this you'd be telling all your friends about them, but because this album came and went, so went its chance to be heard.Don't let that continue! You'll find the work of a true believer, Grant Hart, the one person who could make you believe again.Don't pass up this opportunity."
4,Nice tote - wrong color,"This tote is well made and works for what it is intended. Nice to have the isolation. I ordered a lime green one, but received a blue one. Didn't want the hassle of sending it back, but am disappointed, just the same."
3,"A Great Hero, A Compelling Tale","The 1996 tragedy on Everest makes for compelling reading, regardless of the teller. Boukreev's admittedly limited English (a problem, both during the expedition & in this re-telling), even when cleaned up by DeWalt, certainly makes this, from a pure writing point of view, a less than great book. But clearly Boukreev was a great mountaineer, and performed heroic deeds on Everest on May 10 & 11, 1996. Krakauer apparently was more critical of Boukreev in the Outside article than he was in Into Thin Air, but the suggestion which remains -- that Boukreev's insistence to climb without oxygen somehow contributed to the tragedy -- seemed unfounded when i read it in ITA & seems even more ludicrous after reading Boukreev's account. DeWalt's little Greek chorus thing seems forced and unduly defensive. Don't read this for the writing. Read it to get a first hand account from the hero of the Mountain Madness 1996 Everest expedition."
1,What a waste of time this book was,"This book appears to be written primarily to rebut certain incidents mentioned in Jon Krakauer's book, Into Thin Air. I have no doubt that Boukreev was an experienced and dedicated climber but this book is presented as if he did nothing wrong up on Everest in 1996.I have read almost every book published about the deaths on Everest in 1996 and the concensus of opinion is that everybody did something that contributed to the disaster. Boukreev made his share of mistakes and I would have been more impressed with this book if that concession had been made."
3,Read this one to balance the other one!,"One has to read this book for balance if you've read 'Into Thin Air.' Karakauer's is better written, but compare the stories and perspectives : The Climb balances what Karakauer says, and gives a less emotional perspective to Everest 1996. I found the first 40 pages or so a bit tedious (prepping for the expedition, getting oxygen in Russia, and on and on and on). But it picks up well. Boukreev was, let's face it, the real hero of those days. At that level, people like Boukreev are virtually invincible climbers; the only thing that can break them is avalanches. And so one did, in winter '97 on Annapurna. I wonder, would he have chosen any other way to die? The climbing world lost a great mountaineer. I'm glad he came out with this book."
1,"A Nit-Picking, Profit-engineering diatribe","This add-book by deWalt attempts to stir up more money by scraping the bottom of the barrel to bring up transcripts of altittude-addled interviews. Worse, the Salon sword-crossing with Jon Krakauer is so phony that deWalt appears mostly to be clutching at straws to defend a man whose biggest mistake wasnt that he did not fulfil his guiding duties - but rather the inability to admit a mistake. And the Salon excerpts do go on interminably.Boukreev is a flawed hero but a hero nonetheless.Krakauer's own compelling version of the events bear testimony to this. And as for the sniping by deWalt, has he donated even a dollar of his profits to various mountaineering causes or organisations?The very silence on this issue begs the question whether or not such a book should ever have come out.I suggest all armchair climber thinking of buying this spend their money on World Mountaineering by Audrey Salkeld instead"
2,Glad I borrowed from library instead of buying...,"I borrowed this book through my local library, and I am so glad I did so before purchasing it. If you cannot sew, you will not be able to do several of the designs. The pattern for the handbag pictured on the cover requires sewing skills; additionally, it requires a zipper, and the size and type of zipper necessary is not included in the materials list. Also, the publishers have chosen not to list suppliers in the back of the book, and ask the reader to refer to their website instead. Well, I logged on to Lark's website, and could not find a list of suppliers for this book. Thanksfully, a google of online yarn suppliers will help you locate some decent internet sources that sell some of the more specialty yarns used in this book. I will continue my search for a book on felted knits, and pass on purchasing this one."
1,The Unfinished Movie.,"It is never a good thing when the movie you are watching suddenly stops about 20 minutes or so from the end, as if you accidentally hit the stop button. The movie 'Michael Collins' just stops at what appears to be a dramic scene, then starts again from the beginning. After playing with the remote control, I decided the it was not me, it was the product. Amazon was good about quickly processing the refund."
4,A Solid 4,"This movie was one of the suggestions I selected from an Amazon ""page I just created"" list. Having an Irish background, I am sad to say I did not know who Michael Collins was before I purchased this movie. So I took a look at it from both an educational and entertainment point of view. In the end I felt it did both, educate and entertain.Overall I thought the casting was just OK. I liked Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn, however I didn't care for Julia Roberts as the Kitty Kiernan character for some reason. I liked the story-line, but I am not sure as to the historical accuracy of this portrayal. The overall story seemed to have a few gaps in it.If you enjoy movies like The Patriot, Braveheart, and Gladiator and are looking for entertainment versus authenticity then this is a movie for you."
4,Liam Neeson,Liam Neeson is great as Michael Collins. I can't wait to read Collins' biography. Alan Rickman is great...
1,Utter nonsense,"This film really is appalingly bad!Badly researched,badly scripted and badly cast.If you want an utterly bias account of the easter rising,buy this,if you don't want a completely bias account,read a history book!AVOID!!!"
4,i disagree with black and tan(and not just his name),"Michael Collins could have afforded the move to America. His brother sent him the money to buy a ticket.I would have ranked this movie five stars, but I despise Julia Roberts. Also, I will agree with ""Black and Tan"" that it was not entirely factual."
4,A Very Good and Moving Film,"Excellent acting by Liam Neeson and Stephen Rea, but Julia Roberts and Alan Rickman lose their Irish accents at times and overact at others. Great recreations of Dublin of 80-85 years ago. Very moving scenes involving the Irish people fighting an oppressive British rule, although I would have liked Neil Jordan to have been historically accurate about the British violence in the stadium (a dozen persons killed and no armored vehicles) and not been ambiguous about de Valera being involved in Collins' death (since Jordan believes that he had nothing to do with it, according to an interview in a good documentary on the film, which is included on the DVD)."
1,Pretty much pointless,"I ordered these figures expecting them to be Russian and American army men, with Russian uniforms or American uniforms. Let me tell you this, the set is pretty much pointless (as the title says), and you might as well get some cheap dollar store army men and paint them green or red. Heck, the Soviets even have M16s(!)"
4,Handy garden tool,"Love that this sprayer has one handed operation, I lever I can squeeze while I water versus a nozzle that requires twisting and having to use two hands. This is has a nice weight to it, does not feel cheap or flimsy. Long enough to reach all my baskets, great tool!"
1,"Contains Lead, Has a Cancel Label, Beware!","I was excited to get this watering wand because I read so many good reviews about it.It comes packaged pretty much as-is, no box or packaging. It seems to be well made and feels sturdy.I looked a little closer at the sticker on it and this is what it says:""The brass in this product contains lead. This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause Cancer. Wash hands after touching this product.""Sorry but using lead in the production of a watering tool is a very bad idea. Using lead in the production of anything is bad for the environment and usually produces toxic byproducts that need to be dumped somewhere.It's 2012, can't they figure out how to make a watering wand that does not cause Cancer?"
5,Excellent taste; healthy ingredients - HIGHLY recommended,"It's pretty rare to find cookies that taste good AND doesn't have list of ingredients that looks like organic chemistry manual AND is reasonably priced. The only downside to LemonSnaps I can see is that it's hard to stop eating them :-) . Seriously, it's an excellent product and I hope Amazon will continue selling it."
1,disappointing taste,"I like the fact that the Mi-Del cookies are low-fat and use some organic ingredients. I love the Mi-Del lemon and vanilla flavors, and their ginger snaps are ok -- BUT these chocolate snaps are no good. I'm a chocolate lover, so this is rather disappointing. The taste is similar to the ginger snap, but it's off quite a bit - slightly bitter. It's as if they didn't put enough sugar in these snaps to counter the bitterness of cocoa powder. It also has a poor aftertaste that's slightly bitter (the lemon snap aftertaste is awesome keeps me wanting more).Gotta give it 1 star - yeah, I ate 10 of these to give them a chance, but I threw away the rest of the bag. The crunch and texture is the same as the other Mi-Del Snaps, but the flavor is off. Not Recommended."
2,Buyer BEWARE...,...this is NOT the two disc set that is advertised on TV. I was disappointed when mine arrived and it was only one disc of 18 songs not 30+ :o(
4,Good for old school jams,I think this CD brings back memories from back in the day. It's a good 2 disc. cd's for a long ride or just to releax and listen to.
4,My verdict,"Slow, smooth, sultry - these are apt adjectives to describe the music in this CD. When I first came across it several years ago, I couldn't decide whether I was attracted by the special ""mood"" or repelled by the mannerism. With repeated listenings, I have to conclude that I love it. Call me bad taste if you want, but the music is really enjoyable!"
3,I returned this shoe,The shoe was pretty firm and scratched up the sides of feet. It was cushioned well and wasnt made of soft leather.
3,OK for beginners,"Not as bad as the previous reviews state... This gun is CHEAP and PLASTIC... If you don't know how to take care of it-- don't buy it. Fires easily and 100% of the time if used correctly. Overall, a good gun for the money. The free pistol isn't that great-- but the gun is fine for a beginner."
4,Mengele's end!,"The movie was a great documentary. At least we find out that Mengele suffered later on in life, which should have ended in his hanging, or worse. I like to think he was tortured, at least mentally, for all the horrors he inflicted on tens of thousands of people!"
4,Never Heard Anything Like This,"I've never heard piano work like this. It's almost hard to describe how this work finally taught me how to listen ti piano. This artist is fully in the league of the greatest virtuosos of any generation.My sole reason for not giving this CD five stars is that it's a bit short for thirty bucks. Musically, it's a whole new experience."
1,No Good At All,"Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities. The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album. Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song. The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason. It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear. The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'. Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording. Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL."
2,Just watch the damn movie instead,"NO KANYE, NO CODY CHESSNUT, NO FUGEES, NO C.S.U. MARCHING BAND...these were the highlights of the film! Don't get me wrong--they put some good performances on this CD, but come on...would you buy PE's ""It Takes a Nation of Millions"" if it had no ""Bring the Noise,"" ""Prophets of Rage"" or ""Rebel Without a Pause?""Just put the movie on in another room and listen to it...it's better than this chopped-up soundtrack. It doesn't capture ANY of the raw energy, The power or the impromptu jamming (except for ""You Got me""). The sound quality is better on the movie, too. Great film, bad soundtrack."
2,Only 1 tail light!,"Pictures show 2 lamps. Product arrived and only one in box. The description says ""tail light"" so I guess I should have taken the clue...need 2 separate tail lamps for my boat trailer...duhhh"
5,great for kids..,"We were able to tune it and got it working in a day and with little coaching my 3 yr old starting ""playing"" it that very same day. She loves it, loves the color and loves having her own guitar. I wish they would have packed matching picks with it... but nonetheless, this is a great buy and perfect for your young child."
4,Not a bad little guitar,"Not a bad little guitar for the money. It is just the right size for my 9 year old daughter and it was inexpensive enough that if she ends up not really getting into it, it will be okay. The carry bag is pretty cheap, but what do you expect."
3,happy granddaughter,a gift for my granddaughter she loves it fair shape for the price. i am buying one more for the other granddaughter
2,"Super cute, but plays terrible","This guitar is really cute, love the artwork. It made me sad that I had to return it due to the fact it wouldn't tune. Should be only $20 guitar. If you are serious about wanting your child to play I don't recomend it.If you want an expensive toy this is it."
5,too much excess leads to to downfall,"watched the trailer onlinehad to see this moviebought it on dvdwatched it 10 times alreadya true classicit goes to show you how far your live can downfall when you get too deep into the fame and drugs. not only that it also goes to show you that it's great to be famous. but one should never let it get to their head. that and the drugs. a sick twisted, funny, moving touching movie story. Macauley Culkin is amazing in here. Seth and him are hilarious in their rolesthe murder scene is shockingthe movie moved me, shocked me. and thrilled me all at onceit is worth the watch over and over again. if you're a fan of Culkin's see his movies"
3,He can act...,"I imagine most of America will be interested in Party Monster to see little Macaulay Culkin all grown up. Well, he is, and he turns in a very disturbing performance. After about five minutes of watching him act, you forget Home Alone and buy him as Michael Alig - the ambisexual party king of New York.The movie itself is very enjoyable. I learned a lot about Eighties culture that I'd never known before. Seth Green keeps impressing me with his acting/comic abilities. The film is about grim subject matter but manages to be fun and funny until its sad, grisly conclusion."
3,Ain't Nothin' Like the Real Thing...,"After watching the origional documentary, this movie is pathethic. Culkin and Green act in such a mincing, sing-song manner that they bare no resemblance to their subjects.HOWEVER, the movie does have some hidden treasures:1) You realise, without a shadow of a doubt, that Macauly Culkin CANNOT ACT.2) Chloe Sevigny has a scene where she's in a small bikini. Trust me, it's worth the rental fee to see it.3) Marilyn Manson steals the whole movie as a drag queen. Outragious!!Rent, don't buy."
1,No closed caption or subtitle! :(,Anyone who bought it doesnt have closed caption or subtitle. I need to know since I am Deaf. Please help me.
3,"sick and demented, a great time","I liked this movie to the point where I couldnt stand it anymore but all in all it was a good view. Culkin is ok but he is overpowered by the performance of Seth Green who shines in this flick. not for everyones taste. MArilyn Manson, Chloe Sevingy and Wilmer Valderama also star. highlight is when Seth Green and Culkin are on that talk show and Green is a troll"
2,Party Monster Not So Hyped!,"Purchase from Amazon was good, came in wrapped and nice. Movie was quite boring.. Its more of a documentation of a drug drag, then a out of the boxx movie."
2,He should've stopped at Home Alone 2,"This movie only proved to me that Macauly Culkin really cannot act. Seth Green blew him away literally. This movie could have been good. It had a very interesting premise (at least to me since I was around during all those crazy Limelight days) but wow Culkin singlehandedly ruined it for me.2 stars for subject, set, crazy clubkid costumes and the supporting actors (minus Chloe who also once again played herself--a drugged up moron with no real insight)."
2,"Low, low budget movie","After seeing the documentary on cable, I couldn't wait to see the movie. The movie lacked quality acting and did not flow well at all. The movie also lacked the nightclub seen, which was supposed to be, the basis of this movie. The beginning of this movie bored me and rest was not better. And by the way, what was with the man dressed as a rat telling the story and showing it on a video from a rat hole? I guess Disney had some input. See the original documentary. Use the DVD movie as a drink coaster."
2,Good but...,"This book is on the right track, but when you look at it, many of the tests included are pre-1995, when the SAT was recentered, making them not nearly as useful as the book could be if it were updated. Instead, I suggest ""Gruber's Complete Preparation for the New SAT."" It is an excellent book and raised my score 150 points."
2,Not worth the money,"We purchased this pond filter in late 2008, and as of two years later it has just simply stopped working. We fortunately did not have the same issue as previous reviewers (cracks which lead to draining of the pond), but overall this unit is not worth the money. For $200+, you can most likely find a better filter that will last more than 2 years."
2,Fishmate busted open on side,Just a warning...I purchased my Fishmate 2000 Pressure Filter from Foster-Smith on 5/2008 and it busted open leaking water from the side 5/2012. Same thing happened to me as another reviewer posted from 2009. Except I was lucky to catch mine before all of my fish died. I also cleaned it regularly and took proper care of it....
5,Avant is my idol.,"Avant deserves 5 stars on this one because he knows how to make beautiful music. His voice is uncomparable (even though people compare him to the style of R&B legend R. Kelly) there is only one Avant and if he is compared to R. Kelly then that means he must be great, right? There is really no filler track on this album. Do not burn this album, go and get it now what are you waiting for? Oh, this album is highly recommended for the grown and sexy. Listen at your own risk, and enjoy the love voyage."
3,"Good Album, Not His Best!","This is a good album, but his last two were better. The title doesn't really make sense and the song don't follow the title either. The song with J.D isn't that great and the stickwitu remix doesn't belong on the album, especially not in the middle (should have been a bonus track).4 minutes is nothing unique, and has been done about a million times already and it won't translate into record salesI'm a loyal fan, but I was little dissapointed.Hopefully he get's better production the next go round, the promotion was good, but the album is ok. You can't fool the listeners!"
2,Just a Good Effort,"Since Avant's debut CD, My Thoughts, I really enjoyed the songs because they combined different artists' qualities (including Joe and R. Kelly), and I really wanted another ""Joe"", smooth operator, kind of singer. Well, each CD just got worse and worse, as in many cases with singers, and the end result is this: a cd full of filler songs. The only one that I kind of enjoy is 4 Minutes. I'm dissapointed that he's transitioning into a very mainstream singer and is sounding more and more monotonous. Well, I guess if you can sing and dress well, you got made anyways..."
1,A real lost of money and time!,"Don't lost your money and your time! Why? Because the quality of final image and sound is very, very poor!! And you'll spend more than 16 hours in order to convert a single movie to the 2 MPEG files needed to burn 2 VCDs of 74-80 min... What is the solution I recommend? Use a video capture card and play your movie on DVD or VCR and convert it to MPEG or AVI file in REAL TIME!! then you can burn the files to VCDs or edit them! And what about the final quality? Oustanding sound and picture!"
1,Worst software ever made.,"This is the worst software i have ever tried to use.I am an experienced user,but i could not ger it to work.There should be a law against selling junk like this.The only thing worse than the software is there tech support."
5,A masterwork in O'Connor Literary Criticism!,"Dr. Prown explores a whole new approach to O'Connor. She displays a rare understanding of the place of O'Connor in modern Southern and feminist literature. Dr. Prown goes far beyond the usual realm of literary criticism to place O'Connor into the thread of our everyday lives. I highly recommend this book to scholars, laypersons, and all readers interested in O'Connor, Southern literature, and feminist writers."
1,Is there a minus star?,I purchased this as a backup as I so enjoy my previous copy purchased from Amazon. I did not have the occasion to view it until last night when I discovered it is for the European market and will not play on my American DVD or Computers. Now it is too late for exchange.
3,"Elvgren Was Great, This Book Isn't","Gillette Elvgren was the best pinup artist, so any opportunity to see his work is welcomed. However, this book is disappointing: it looks like it was designed by amateurs trying too hard to make an artsy coffee table book. From the cover to the flopped photographs to the inane captions, it is irritating to browse through. His work deserves better."
4,EXCELLENT,"For CTI, this is pretty out. Joe Ferrel gathered one hell of a band for Moon Germs. Herbie Hancock, Jack Dejonette, and a young Stanly Clarke.The songs start here with melodic heads, but build steam into lengthy jams. This is not the free jazz of Impulse, but Hancock pushes the tempo on electric piano and provides a thick, chromatic bottom as each track extends into open space. Clarke here is particularly daring, doing a lot of double stops and playing AROUND the time Hancock provides, not locking into it. Ferrel flies with his saprano sax.Moon Germs reminds me of mid-1970s Soft Machine. The freedom here does not crate abrasive dissonance, but a floating, racing whirl of sound.You're enveloped. Become so."
4,Great Reference Book!,"I got this book after reading the reviews on this board. I found that this book offers great references for an experienced and knowledgeable finance/statistics professional to find quick reference on certain Excel functions. However the book might be a little lack of in terms of explaining the concepts and business implications. In particular, I would like to see more examples and business cases that illustrate how business managers could make the most out of the use of Excel techniques!I would recommend it to experienced users only."
4,Good card,"I want to point out this card works in all AGP >3.0 slots (AGP4, pro)It uses DVI-I (Integrated) interface (DVI-D and DVI-A)Pros: It does a great job. It was the only card I could find for my AGP Pro socket, but it does the job wellCons: It positions the screen 4-5 inches to the right. Computer monitors can correct for this. I have mine connected to a TV and NVIDIA drivers will not change screen position, so I have to user a pretty substantial overlay to correct for this.In other words, it works fine, but could cause problems for other people using TV monitors."
1,The wrong GC for my mobo,I can not really type up a review because this was not the correct graphics card for my motherboard...
2,looks outdated,"The book's design is tiresome; I do not know, it is not pleasant to study with it. Something is missing and .... gee..."
3,Didn't work for the job at hand,"I have used this stuff in the distant past and it worked. This time I had old rusty motorcycle parts to restore and it did nothing. I think this is more geared toward simple shallow surface rust. Multi-decade hard core rust is not what it's for. I'm going to try evapo-rust, if that doesn't work it's time for a glass bead blasting."
4,Dumb,This movie is the dumbest movie since Dumb and Dumber. Written by the same guy who did the Bill And Ted movies (another set of dumb movies!); this is not the magnum opus of dumbness but it is so beautifully dumb! And dumbly acted I might add.(Dumb means hilarious)
3,Seriously underrated,"Yes...Evil Alien Conquerers is straight to video, full of stupid gags that mostly involve people yelling very loudly, and features an uncredited Tori Spelling in a minor role...but it is actually very funny. With veteran comedians all over the place, and some of the silliest and most unexpected stunts and throwaway lines, this film simply made me laugh for 86 minutes straight. Just think ""Coneheads"" plus a great deal of ""Dude,Where's My Car"" and many roles that Jack Black could have easily walked into, and that's this film. The DVD looks to only be full-screen, with no extras, and that's only one of the few minor drawbacks. Who would pass up a deal like this? Only an a**hole!"
3,Good introduction to schools of critical thought and analysis,"I used this book to prepare to write a thesis on a literary topic, utilizing critical, analytical theory. This is a fine introduction to the various schools of critical thought with specific short chapters discussing them. The body of the book is this look at the schools of critical thought - a nice, quick but careful look at each. Among those discussed: New Criticism, Structuralism, Reader-response criticism, reception theory, Deconstructionism, Post-colonial theory, and feminist theory. The research techniques chapter may feel a bit dated, but it's hard to keep up with the internet revolution. Textual scholarship is nicely discussed in a separate section, and tips for getting going on a dissertation are suggested, along with a series of rather cute 'library exercises.' I bought it for the introduction to critical schools of thought, and it suits that purpose admirably."
3,"Cute, but not that comfy if you have wide feet","I wear a size 7 1/2 and usually wear an 8 to accommadate my wide feet, so I didn't really notice that the shoes were bigger in size then they should be like others reported. Unfortunately, these shoes still aren't wide enough even though they are a larger size, which usually works with me. They are a little painful to wear, but hopefully they will stretch some with more wear. So, while these shoes are very cute, beware if you have wide feet like me. Also, the top part of the shoe (where the buckle is) was a little shorter than I thought it looked in the picture (it's about 3 inches) in case you don't like shoes in that style."
5,Great shoes!,"These shoes are cute and comfortable! I love the color, and the fact that they already have a ""worn"" look because of the color means I'll be wearing them through many seasons."
1,Do not buy this product!,"This product is really smelly. Would not want baby breathing it in. Plus, Wayfair sent me wrong product and then told me to place re-order directly with them which seems wrong.....plus, there were no instructions included and not self explanatory. Buy the baby jogger brand instead."
5,Excellent!,I bought these 2 yrs ago for my son and we are now starting to use them in 1st grade to practice spelling words and get ready for his first spelling test. We find the letters to make his words and then jumble up the letters and I ask him to spell certain words and he finds the letters. He (and I) thinks it is great. I think it gives learning a nice twist for kids. Great product.
5,Trustworthy seller,"Although it took a little longer than I had hoped for, it arrived alright and I was pleased. Recommend this seller."
4,NIV Bible,"An excellent study Bible, very portable and easy to use. It is being used by my daughter in her Bible class at school. Fits her needs perfectly."
4,...,"You bought a set of runes and have not one clue what to do with them? This book will guide you through the history of the rune, different readings you may do with them, along with an explaination of each rune (along side it's picture for those who are just beginning). This wonderful small book is excellent for beginners. Only set back is that the history might confuse you a small bit."
5,"An excellent, clearly-written book",I think this book is a gem! It's clearly written in a step-by-step way that is extremely helpful in this course. I really appreciate the sample research proposals and the examples. This book helped me prepare for my own research project.
3,Hard to use slide switch on back to set and stop alarm,"The clock is attractive and solid feeling, but the switch to set the alarm on and off is a small hard to use slide switch on the back. There is no easy off button for when the alarm goes off."
2,Nice looking but . . .,A beautiful checkbook cover that even has a pen holder. But the problem is when I put the checks in (regular sized) the cover will not lay flat. Perhaps it will after awhile but I've never had a checkbook cover do this before. I can't recommend this item.
3,"I ordered two, but wish I hadn't","I've ordered two of these, about a year apart. I've been satisfied, despite the fact that the checkbook cover gapes open slightly with the checks and ledger in (to stop this problem, I removed the pen holder, took the stitching off with a pair of scissors, and over time, the gaping problem goes away). But I just ordered a different brand of checkbook cover from Amazon.com, and it's so much more elegant than this eelskin checkbook cover. So now I regret ordering this one twice, as it reminds me of Frankenstein with all the stitching and seams. It looks strange next to the elegant dark brown cowhide leather checkbook cover that just arrived. The quality of this product is unquestioned, but in terms of style, I'm suffering buyer's remorse."
2,Nice but doesn't stay closed !!!!,"Irritating...whoever said this cover stayed closed was WRONG! It's very nice looking but so annoying that even with no pen in the slot, mine will NOT STAY CLOSED. DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS!Eel Skin Basic Checkbook Cover"
3,"Christmas Collection, Michael W Smith","What can I tell about it. Its a nice cd and that what it is. Further the length of the songs and the diversity of the songs, its not what I expected. Its not my favorit christmas cd.Sending/transport are quickly and oke."
4,Murder City Series One,"The mysteries are quite good, and keep you carefully keeping track of all action, so as to follow and try to solve. One must be prepared, however, that these are not the English ""Comfortable"" murder musteries. More blood and graphic scenes, overall more ""harsh"" than Agatha Christi, and Midsommer Murders, as example. Still enjoyable, as long as you know ahead what you will be seeing. Acting is excellent."
1,; O yawn...,"Nothing new or memorable here, just endless banal filler that fails to satisfy or excite. Honestly, there wasn't one song that really stood out on this cd. I had expected more as a lifelong fan of Nancy's but this leaves me puzzled and quite dissapointed."
3,Disappointing In The End,"Certainly an improvement from her ""One More Time"" album, but I found this album to be disappointing in the end...The only songs I like are ""Let Me Kiss You"", ""Burning Down The Spark"", and ""Two Shots Of Happy, One Shot Of Sad"" ...The album just doesn't make any impact, except that it's back to the drawing board for Nancy & Co."
4,Privacy Screen is actually Private,This screen is worth the money. It works very well and is easy to install. Keeps the snoops away!
2,Not a good fit,"Was not the correct size for my monitor. I had to take out a pair of scissors and ""customize"" it for my screen."
3,"Good product, bad aesthetics.","The product does what it says, however the tabs you stick to the monitor are not invisible and look like tape. Not for a professional environment."
5,I can now work in peace,"Great product works exactly as intended. The picture is still clear through the filter within an acceptable field of vision, and starts blacking out exactly at the angle you would expect it to.I've used it for hours with no problems with my vision, a nod to the quality product produced by 3M. I bought another brand for a second monitor and was extremely disappointed in the competitors quality, so i ended buying another 3M filter for my second monitor as well.If you don't want prying eyes watching you work, I would recommend this product - 5 stars"
2,"Works, but reduces resolution by 15 years","This filter does work, and blocks viewing from any angle but straight in front of the screen. However, the dark tint of the filter and the clarity of it are horrible. It made my Viewsonic 24"" HD monitor look grainy, and like it was set at a low color setting (i.e. 256 colors like the OLD days). While typing this review, I couldn't even seen the lines which outline the text boxes. I've adjusted contrast and brightness with no improvement. Again, it'll keep others from seeing what's on your screen, but may also keep you from seeing it."
4,A little too dark..,"This size fits perfectly on a 21.5 inch monitor.The 30 degree angle measurement for the privacy panel seems accurate.Due to the dark shading of the item, it looks as if the screen is OFF to a person sitting perpendicular to the user.Definitely recommend!but I do wish that the shading was slightly lighter..."
1,Monitor Privacy,The monitor privacy screen filter is not doing the job we had hoped it would do. It does not give the screen the privacy we thought it would and it is fairly expensive for what it is.
4,Lite-Brite,"My 5 year old LOVES this and has gone through all of the pictures. I, too, had a problem finding a place that sells the refills. [...] They have a variety to choose from."
5,Nice item!,"While I didn't buy mine here, I have had mine for a bit over a year now, and no problems yet, thank Goodness!I'm not really a hi-tech type, but I did get mine up and running in a bit under 5 minutes! It was so easy to do, and that surprised me.I mostly use mine to back-up data and files, and have even switched it between computers with no problems.Over all, it's a nice little set up, and the portability and ease of use is nice!"
1,Waste of a Company,"This has to be one of the worst companies in the computer industry. Their products simply - Suck. Their customer service makes The Soviet Union look friendly. I've never had such bad results from a product. And once I needed help for a repair, they were as vague, slow, and unhelpful as it gets. It would be a service to the industry if this company closed it's doors for good and never entered the business again."
3,"Golden Palominos, The - Prison Of The Rhythm Remixes","The Golden Palominos get the remix treatment for PRISON OF THE RHYTHM; the original is grindy funk, carried by the rhythm and Lori Carson's fragile voice, but Bill Laswell's mix dubs up the track into a long, slow jam (with ambient, pornographic interludes!). The Psychick Warriors ov Gaia loop a rhythm and give the track a hypnotic pull, while Adam Peters gives it a slightly more tech feel, with a Roland line and a more prominent kick drum. Overall, though, these mixes don't do enough to expand the original; they all seem like minor variations, rather than transformations."
4,good overall,"A first rate concert. Filming this in hi-def was a good move. Sound is terrific. Amy goes thru her best stuff from every stage of her long career. The band is very good and Amy's vocals are as good as they've ever been. My only complaint is the ""artsy"" editing: quick cuts,MTV video type effects,(especially at the beginning).I was blaming the director for this,until I discovered that it was Amy Grants idea to do this in a bonus feature interview. It gets better after awhile, particularly during the excellent acoustic set. Overall,for new or old fans alike,well worth owning."
4,A fun way to educate during snack time...,"We purchased this placemat back in December, and we've been using it during our 5 yr old son's snack times. It seems fairly sturdy, cleans up well, AND our son has already memorized where several states are (by asking which are the ones that friends and relatives live in). The only real drawback is that it doesn't have no-slip backing, but that hasn't caused any accidents...yet. Overall, I'm very please with the purchase and will probably buy some of the other ones (for snack times) if it holds up for another month or so."
3,Dinnertime distraction,I bought this (with 3 other designs from the same seller) in hopes that this would offer my 2y/o and my youngest daughter a distraction while my husband and I tried to finish a meal together without woofing down our food. I was expecting something a bit thicker for the price but the design is well done and it is easy to clean off after dinner. It may be a bit old for my oldest yet so I still have hopes for it. I haven't received the other designs but I'd imagine that they are the same.
3,(from Popwatch #10),"Groove types throw money at DJ Spooky and DJ Shadow. If Doug Sharin would chuck a vocal sample into the mix every once in a while he could go to the bank. This band uses maybe 90% ""real"" instruments but goes after a deceptively ""artificial"" kind of extended space vamping. You might imagine Meat Beat Manifesto having a go with a violinist and tabla player after a long night of editing. This is best as bedtime music; the groove is steady throughout and you should be relaxed enough to get lulled. It's not exciting music -- it's insular and textural, gradual rather than immediate. Jack Walton, Popwatch magazine #10"
3,Not the best,This is not by far the best work of Ten years after. But it was needed to complete my collection.
5,A cult rock album!,"CRICKLEWOOD GREEN was one these outstanding albums that nourished and wrought still more the status of living legend of Alvin Lee who by then, was regarded as the fastest guitar all over the world.Indeed, after his successful and unforgettable incursion in Woodstock (who can forget his devastating and febrile performance ""I'm going home by helicopter"", many people began to realize the praised epithets went far beyond ane motional acknowledgement.Alvin as the leader of the group knew to impress the band of a balanced sound that went from the classic rock pieces to the saddest blues and from time to time a happy incursion in jazz lands.This album contributed notably to enhance the wrought legend and was a rotund success in its style. The band will always be reminded and recognized as one of the most prominently ranked in its category and cult rock ensembles ever existed in the late sixties."
5,Restaurant Quality,"First I'd like to thank JS, Aaron Knight, and lmc2007""lmc"" for their reviews suggesting that these glasses are available at Walmart and dollar stores for under or at $1 each. I bought the 22 oz size at Walmart for 97 and a smaller size at a ""dollar store"" (i.e. Deals in Columbus, Ohio) which saved me a significant amount of cash. And yes you do have to watch the manufacturer, both stores had similiar glasses manufactured in China by a company other than Libbey and they weren't as clear as the Libbey glasses.These are great heavy duty glasses. I'd call them ""restaurant quality"". They look great and should last forever. However, (another good thing about them is they have been in production at Libbey for several years and are likely to still be available for many more years), so if you do happen to break one getting a replacement shouldn't be a problem."
2,"""L"" is for Lacking","Other reviewers have compared this one to ""H."" They're right. This is an ""on the road with the bad guys"" adventure. No real mystery here, and other than a few interesting scenes, not much worthy of note.The supporting cast that has been weaved through the other novels is noticably absent from this book. Maybe they were working on other projects. The book suffers from this, mainly because the replacement players are not nearly as compelling or, frankly, fun.By the time Kinsey ends up in Kentucky, you will find yourself saying ""Who cares? Get back to Santa Teresa.""All in all, it was a disappointing read, annoying so because my prior experience with these books means that you cannot skip the bad ones."
2,derivative and uninteresting,"I read this book because Sue Grafton is, apparently, all the rage in the mystery field. I wanted to find out why she's so highly regarded, and I still haven't found out. Her main character is so forgettable I still don't think I remember her name right (Kinsey Millhone, or something like that). She is indistinguishable from every other tough-guy private eye except that she uses the women's rest room. That difference isn't enough to carry a story! Furthermore there was nothing in the plot that surprised me or made me wonder what was going to happen next.I'm an avid mystery reader, and I don't think Grafton stacks up with the really accomplished mystery/suspense writers: Margaret Maron, Marcia Muller, P D James, Elizabeth George, Mary Higgins Clark, Sharyn McCrumb, Anne Perry, Carolyn Hart, to name several.BO - RINNGGG."
3,I noticed something about this,"Am I the only one who noticed an apparent similarity of plots between this book in the Kinsey Millhone series and Clint Eastwood's movie, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'? Maybe I'm crazy, but it really does seem similar. So, it's a possible tongue-in-cheek story. Good enough."
2,Nothing too exciting happens,"I've forgotten already what the lead character's name is, but someone who would turn their nose up at $8,000 isn't worth remembering. But, most of the characters are acceptable, except for the case of one woman who was terribly annoying. And yet, when she's taken hostage by a murderer, no one seems to be all that concerned about it, not even her family. They're more interested in finding some money. When next she's seen again, no one bothers to ask her if she's all right or anything. Apparently no one in the book cared all that much about her, either."
2,Maybe a 2.5,"This is my first Sue Grafton book. She is a good writer, very detailed-oriented. On the one hand, i found the minutia a bit tedious. On the other hand, i liked having everything spelled out. Mysteries are sometimes so convoluted i get lost after a couple of turns.That said, the book was alright, perfect light reading. I do have some problems as to the resolution of the whole story: why Kinsey held on to the end, why Gilbert came back unarmed, and so forth. Still, an OK read."
3,Where is the editor?,"I've read and enjoyed all the Kinsey Millhone books. Just reread L IS FOR LAWLESS. Maybe it's just me getting more picky as time goes on, but I hate holes in the plots. For example, Laura, who must be one of the densest characters Grafton has ever created, talks about never being able to escape from Gilbert because he'd track her down where ever she goes. A few pages later she's thinking about staying in Dallas because he'll never find her there. Also, enough is enough on Kinsey's underwear. By now the reader is more than aware that Kinsey likes clean panties. Is it really plausable that an old man living in a dump in CA would never attempt to retrieve his hidden loot from a 40 year old bank heist?"
5,Great movie for it's time!,"This movie, in my opinion, is one of the best movies Jerry ever made. At 70, I grew up with Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis."
4,dvd,It came quickly. And it plays well. It wasn't scratched or anything. It wasn't late or anything. I guess that's it.
4,From The Beginning,"This is the beginning of the great Al Green. You can see where he emulated James Brown on a couple of tunes. The best story is, this album was first out in 1966 - 67. A few years later when Al hit with Let's Stay Together and Tired Of Being Alone, Guilty was release as a single and everybody was hunting for a new Al Green album. Back Up That Train, Brother Green."
4,Great disc; nobody is cooler than slim,"Times Like This oscillates from quirky to great, with mostly the latter. Ignore the sound bytes, the best songs are the sleepers. I'll say one thing; this man has soul, and his music fabulously shows it. A definite buy if you're an ex mats buff, or just want a great twist on pop/folk/blues in an atmosphere you wont' find elsewhere. Buy it."
2,Not enough data,"Don't expect a rich dataset you can pore over and glean interesting observations from. This is mostly a list of the best players at each position and a few comments about each one, some of which have a some statistical grounding, others of which are merely anecdotal. And it was clearly written a few years ago. This seems like it should be a much slimmer volume than it is.I wish Bill James would do his annual book again with lots of interesting facts and figures."
2,Too Heavy on Metrics,"I'll start with the good:1. Covers the entire timeline of the sport2. Makes convincing arguments with his metricsThe bad:1. Book gets boring after the first few chapters. The best parts are about the origins of the sport as they are more descriptive rather than the stat-heavy parts later on.2. Book is stat-heavy and omits many of the magical moments of the game. For instance he doesn't even mention Hershiser's 1988 season or Kirk Gibson's World Series homerun. Not to mention Vin Scully is not even mentioned in the book. Vin Scully was only named best sportscaster of the century by the ASA! Admittedly I grew up a Dodgers fan but to not include stuff like this is inexcusable from such a big book that claims to cover the history of the sport.I came away feeling empty reading this book and felt it was a waste of time. I was left wondering if the author even watches baseball games, or just compiles box scores?"
4,Mindless Pablum? I think not,"No offense, but baseball fans have been arguing about player rankings for a long time now. What true baseball fan among us hasn't gotten into a discussion of the relative merits of say, Joe Dimaggio vs. Wille Mays, Walter Johnson vs. Roger Clemens, etc., etc.? More than any other sport, baseball encourages comparison of players from different eras. Now, maybe you've never sat down and actually came up with a list, but, really, he isn't doing anything different in principle here than the types of comparisons mentioned above, he's just a lot more thorough. And of course there is a lot more to this book than just lists of 100 players at each position. It is funny, engaging, thought-provoking. I recommend it."
4,Great rendition,"I was recently in a production of ""Gypsy"" and have grown pretty attached to it. I thought this rendition was done quite well, but I prefer the Baby June from the original film and I prefer the strippers from the original film as well. I like Bette's performance the best out of the other Mama Rose actresses from film and/or Broadway.My only complaint was a small glitch in the DVD that causes it to skip. Maybe a spin on the Disc Doctor will cure it."
5,Gypsy. 1993 TV version DVD,"Gypsy was a popular stage show with Ethel Merman with music by Jule Styne & Stephen Sondheim. From Everything is Comin Up Roses to Let Me Entertain You this show has many great songs. Filmed by Warner Bros with Rosalind Russell as Mama Rose & Natalie Wood as her daughter Rose who became Gypsy Rose Lee, this TV version(1993) is highly entertaining and runs the 150mins of the Warner film. Bette Midler plays her part well in a story that is very reminiscent of an era that was once in US live theatre. The opening credits depicts stills of performers in stills from this long gone era. I have the original Laserdisc of this TV version from its original issue and I was pleased to be able to get the DVD into my collection. It will be regularly run for my enjoyment. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to collectors of stage musical material."
4,One wonderful production of the great musical,"Though a remake..it is still refreshingly new. i noticed the same in the dialogue....but bette midler did it with such a flair. the child stars were talented...and well-cast...and the whole show was genuinely enjoyable. the cast all had powerful and great vocals...adding enjoyment to the musical numbers, especially ""If Mama was married"" I could watch this over and over...and i am."
1,Disappointing,"I quote from the books PREFACE; ""Note that, in this Second Edition, many Stevens illustrations and descriptions are not presented."" That means most of the Stevens information is gutted from this book and only the last three chapters offer new information on Savage. Save your money, find a copy of the First Edition which is a great book."
5,Great and sexy smell!,Gift for husband that was well received. I recommend it for all men and their women.Good smell lingers all day.
1,Unforbiable By Sean John for Men,I will never forgive the choice of notes in this Eau De Toilette Spray.The fragrance is a over powering smell. Gross
5,CHRISTMAS GIFT,THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY SON AND HE WAS VERY PLEASED THAT HIS MOM WOULD BUY HIM THIS TYPE OF GIFT
5,Sybil Edwards' book was easy to follow and understand.,"The author did an excellent job at breaking down a somewhat intimidating craft medium (decorative painting) into simple steps & brush strokes. The reader gains a better understanding of the techniques and more confidence in applying them. (Hint: practice does indeed make perfect!) This book is the perfect starting point for beginning as well as experienced decorative painters. Don't let the title (""Acrylic Decorative Painting...) fool you, the techniques shown in this book would apply to oil painting as well. Sybil Edwards' book shows how to paint decorative backgrounds, floral motifs and other characters or ""bold"" painting. The decorative painting book by Priscilla Hauser focuses solely on floral techniques (which she does very well). ""Acrylic Decorative Painting Techniques"" is a must-have book for any crafter's home library!"
1,You guys Suck,"Did Not fit as advertised, too late now to return, will be sure to keep around as a reminder to never buy like this again"
5,One of the best ever,"I've been a fan of Ed Emberley's books since I was a child and used his series to learn to draw. My son loves this book - we've already gone through 3 copies of it! We've also had several friends ask us for copies for their own children - haven't met one yet who doesn't like the book. And, it's great for kids who are afraid of monsters since they can tell the Big Green Monster to GO AWAY and he does. Also great for groups of kids who enjoy yelling GO AWAY at the top of their lungs. A definite must on the kids shelf."
4,No more Monsters!,"This is a great book to ease childhood boogy man fears. My three year old grabs this book at bedtime a lot. I think she gets it, (at least I hope she does). Great book never the less."
3,Music not as lively as we had hoped,We ordered this CD after having attended a Spanish Guitar concert that inspired us with the beauty and complexity of the instruments. This CD contains lovely music; but we find it more suitable for background dinner music rather than music to actively listen to. It's a little pale in comparison to the concert we attended. We'll keep looking...
4,Hilarious!,"It would usually be difficult to say this about an all-covers band, but these guys are creative geniuses! Their satirical deconstructions of ""alternative"" rock standards are clever and well-executed. This is quite unlike any other synthesizer music you have ever heard."
5,Excellent historical account,"Other's reviews led me to purchase this book and I found it to be a excellent history of the Korean War, the roots of the conflict, the military actions, and the political reasons for the ""limited war"". The personal accounts of prisoners of war were especially interesting as were the Communist intrigue and subversion of Koje-do. All in all a very well put-together historical account. Well done."
2,A Whole Lot of Typos,"KINDLE EDITION - A fine book, a worthwhile read. It's a shame the publisher could not be bothered to correct the many typos (""wife"" for ""wire""). Kindle should make a policy of hounding these rip off publishers to issue corrected editions to buyers."
4,A critical account of the Korean War.,"Written in the decade following the Korean War, this account of the ""Forgotten War"" pulls no punches. It clearly tells the mistakes made on both sides of the front. To anyone familiar with the political/military situation on the Korean pennisula today, this book is a frightening parallel. Fehrenbach's account is a must read for today's military professionals (it is on the Air Force Chief of Staff's Professional Reading Program basic list)"
3,Not for the complete novice--has editing problems.,"I am complete novice--this book is not for me. It tries to cover too much material and skips key steps.There are also editing problems: The authors waste space they could have devoted to foundational concepts by repeating a lot of material. Also, many photos are not labelled at all (pages 369 - 383) or are mislabelled (hot wire labelled as ground on page 465)."
5,Ideal for do-it-yourself homeowners.,"Over two hundred color photos pack a home repair guide which covers most of the common repairs a homeowner will need to know about; from caulking windows and fixing door knobs and locks to exterior painting and insulating. A recommended pick for any homeowner, Complete Photo Guide To Home Repair deserves a place on personal as well as professional bookshelves."
2,"Frustratingly professional, not for the idiot :)","I have this book for the last 3 years. I could never make use of the book because it assumes that I'm already a plumber, a technician, a carpentar, a mason etc...This book is not for the ordinary people like me; rather it is for a professional who is already in this type of craft and trying to improve himself.However, I turn the pages from time to time like a National Geographic Atlas, or my high school photo album.I never ever recommend this for people like me. If you are not in this ""home repair"" business, please refrain from the idea of having this heavy gizmo."
4,looks good,bought as a gift based on good reviews. A brief flip through the book and it looks like it will be a good resource.
5,deeper into diving 2nd sdition,"i am looking for the same book deeper into diving but the 2nd edition, can anybody tell me where i can find it. thank you"
1,"Pretentious, boring, art-wannabe timewaster","So the director shared an Oscar with Tarantino and apparently some producer gave hime a big fat check to make this pretentious ""thoughtful"" SF disaster. Don't waste your time cuz nothing works in boring ""art"" piece. Actually it looks like it would properly work as a stage play..well, maybe not. ""Killing Zoe"" was an okay flick but this turd is as bad as ""Closetland"". Mr. Hauer has wasted his talent with yet another bomb but what's new."
4,Good cleaner,I used this product to my 2011 Mustang's black leather seats. Seats weren't very dirty so I didn't expect any major visible result. Product was easy to apply and wipe out it still was able to remove some dirt from my seats. Seats were little bit darker after the treatment. After the cleaner I used Lexol leather conditioner.
4,best product in the market yet!,"I bought a natuzi sectional sofa and when it arrived had a peice that was damaged, so they replaced it. The peice they replaced had a slight dull color which you can tell only if you are looking at certain angle. I tried few leather cleaner with no success. Finally I came across this product and I purchased both cleaner and restorer. When I used this product not only it was easy to use but it did give me a very good results. Now you can hardly see the diference in color. It cleans and restores the leather to make it look soft, bright and natural.Money well spent. It also works on car interior, leather seats etc."
5,Bliss,"This is the best album I have ever heard. I have sung several of Barbers choral works and rapture still fills me when I hear these works. The lyrics parity all I have said about the composition. If you are in doubt, just listen to a single track."
1,Can find the same info other places without the marketing,Jarrod Jablonski is the owner of the FOR Profit group GUE which teaches DIR which pushes you must dive one gear configuration made up of most Halcyon gear. Halcyon is owned by Jarrod Jablonski and Robert Carmichael.You can get the same info from other places without the marketing hype.
3,Not the latest version but still good info,"This is not the latest version of the book. As good as this one is, the new one has a lot more & updated info. This book does not have the oil of oregano protocol or the cd . I sent it back because there was ink writing in the book too. The list price was $24 on the book cover but I was charged $32 for an old book.I had no problem getting a refund from Amazon. I ordered the e-book from the ""real"" website. If you have gut issues, it might help you too."
4,When the Soundtrack is better than the movie,"Excellent Soundtrack full of old classics, evokes the mood, the scene without even watching the film. AS good as the soundtrack to French Kiss and thats high praise."
5,To damn funny,"This dude is just so ""F"" ing funny. I might not be able to wait for it to be sold on amazon and just buy it from the askaninja site. I wish this guy would come to comic con or something. One of the funniest things I have seen this year."
2,Tragic story made boring,"I had high expectations for this book. I agree with other readers that some of my unanswered questions were answered. I also agree that Anne Frank was a very interesting person...too bad this author didn't think so too. This was a very dry, boring read."
3,Belt Holder for Palm PDA,"Holder and cover for Palm Tungsten E-2 made by Belkin. If you are looking for a belt holder for your E-2, this appears to be sturdy product. If you are looking for the compact flip cover that came with the PDA -- this is a bulky substitute."
4,no title,"I bought this book for its collectible value, because the format is so unusual. Accordian folds. Then, naturally, I did read it. Carefully. Filled with baseball stats. Pictures are great, but very small."
1,Not enough information,"I would love to write a review about this product if I could use it. The problem is I can't find any information about it. Before I buy, I need to know more about the product. Please advise! Maniusa Graham"
3,Works Good,Wasn't what I needed but that wasn't the fault of the product. I modified it and it works fine for me now.
2,My Experience with ACT,I'v been using ACT for 2 years. No considerable complaints with ACT6 but when I upgraded to ACT 2005. It's too slow. Time-is-money and waisting time with it I wasting too much money. I'm out now. I'll better go to Terrasoft CRM or wait for Goldmine7.Jack

2,A Bum Trip,"It's dissapointing that this music is representing Richard D. James's continuing musical evolution, especially after the brilliantWindowlickerwhich kept me on the edge of my seat during the seemingly endless 2 year wait for his next release.No point in highlighting out any track in particular, no track stands out enough for me to bother deciphering the confusing chicken-scratch layout of the cumbersome song titles. The drum-n-bass pieces are merely good, but not great. (There are other musicians who are doing more exciting things with beat programming, some are even Aphex's label mates!) On a positive note the quiter interludes of piano pieces are actually quite good, which range in a variety of moods, and have more character to them than the rest of the material.Overall, the record feels like and endless series of outtakes from Aphex's past glories. If it was marketed as such, then perhaps I could trust in his talents again and look forward to his next release."
3,"It was good, but I wasn't impressed","I had sampled some Aphex Twin work from the internet before buying this album, and was amazed by what I heard. The CD arrived and I was not amazed, actually, I was a little disappointed.The music is good, but it gets boring and tedious after a while.Unfortunately, the fact that this is a double CD does not help.If you like this sort of music and have heard it all and have 30+ CD's like this, consider getting it.If you are starting out with this sort of music, there is a lot you need to buy before getting this.Yes, it sounds good and is different, but it becomes boring and tedious after a while.I wouldn't have bought it if I heard it prior to ordering.Sorry! I just wasn't impressed!"
4,Clear and Accurate,"Used on my Mosin Nagant m91-30 with the brass stacker mount.I put 5 rounds in a 1-1/2"" group at 100yds-The optics are pretty clear until you get to 8 or 9 power then they are a bit fuzzy. I had a hard time finding a scout scope more than a 7 power maybe that's why.-Scope rings are ok you have to be careful how you tighten them down and do it all evenly or it will not sit right on the mount. Just some extra care is all.-Great eye relief-I dropped it once... accident. Still held its zero.If you take the time and care to install this correctly you get more than your moneys worth."
4,Great Scout Scopes,"I use this scopes on my Mosin Nagant Sporters, and they are awesome. Any brush gun setup will work with these. Just not happy it takes so long for them to ship. Expect a 7-10 day wait until they ship it."
5,AWESOME,"The Scope:- It's huge (about 15"" long)- All parts seem to be metallic (except the lenses!).- According to the manual, it is ""shockproof and waterproof"".- It's clear, sharp, and precise.- The zoom is powerful (up to 7x32mm), and smooth, not in steps.- Adjustment knobs/rings are solid and protected by caps.- It comes with the following accessories, all packed-up in a nice box:--> 2 lens protectors attached with 2 solid elastic ropes--> a set of 2 metallic rings (looks like weaver base but not sure)--> a lens cloth- Long-Eye relief (8-11"") makes it perfect for my Crosman 2240 (460+ fps/.22 cal pellets), 357 (430 fps/.17 cal pellets), Umarex Baby Desert Eagle pistols (450 fps/.17 BB's) or any other pistol/rifle.The Service:- Free 2-day shipping with free Amazon Prime trial.- Free return w/ free UPS pick-up (should not be necessary for this item!)- Got here right on time, in perfect shape.The price (including 2-day shipping + no tax): $42Enough said..."
2,NcSTAR 2 - 7x32 mm AO Pistol Scope,Buyer Beware this is not an AO scope like the title claims. AO stands for adjustable objective and this scope does not have adjustable objective.
3,good,Bought this for my grandson as well. So far so good. I will update after he has it awhile longer.
4,Philosophy/Religious Studies,"From a Philsophy/Religous Studies perspective, this was a great book. Being more inclined to the Myth, I gravitated to the second section of the book: ""Christian History and Tradition."" I enjoyed the analysys by Karen Armstrong and Gail Ramshaw on the gender of God. For those of the Judeo-Christian faiths, I recommend this. For gravitate to Mysticism , like myself, I recommend reading just the first and second sections of this book -- really good."
5,On the Money,"I am a lawyer from las vegas, that traveled to moscow, russia, numerous times to host a business venture. After my first trip, i came across this book and was startled to realize that Ames is on the money with his description of Moscow. Anyone planning a trip to Moscow, must read this book. It is an easy read and really allows the reader to gleen an inside to the beauty behind the beast that is Moscow."
5,"Excellent music, very well played and recorded.","There is no need underlining the genius of Berlioz in the Fantastique, is there? Karajan and the BPO are in top form in this recording session, and DG's recording engineers are playing well above their usual game on this disc."
4,Odd enough 4 me,"Well, if so-called modern art makes you sick/laugh/sigh (or whatever), here's one artist you may like, as long as you appreciate sur-realism combined to the works of the Old Masters. Try this book that seems to be the best among the few, with clever lines that explains the approach of the painter and fine and numerous reproductions. Last but not least: go to see his exhibitions (big formats to fill up your eyes) and try his own book ""On kitsch"""
4,oldie but goodie,"Read this book years ago to my sons. They and I still remember it fondly. Just gave it as a gift to 2 1/2 year old twins who I'm sure will love it, too. The illustrations in the book are just charming, and the sweet plot reinforces how good it is to be a helper, no matter how tough the going."
1,Does not seem to like Vista,"Installing it went fine, connected to my network smoothly. Then I noticed one of my two CPU cores was just sitting at 100% utilization. As soon as I disabled the card it would drop down to near 0% again. Website is near useless for this product, one Beta driver (that wouldn't install at all), no knowlege base entries, etc. I suspect d-link is just slow at getting vista enabled drivers out. Sent an e-mail off to D-link, but I'm probably going to send it back."
2,Crappy product support,"I previously had the DWA 650 Adaptor. It operated almost as good as the 652 and I did not need product support to learn about it. The 652 added a ""wlanGina.dll"" on my computer and changed the way I use my computer. Dlink product support knew nothing about it. The gave me driver updates that did nothing to correct the problem. The told me ""wlanGina.dll"" was a virus so I went to Norton support who quickly crashed my whole computer. I had to have my computer reformatted only to learn that ""wlanGins.dll"" was their (dlink) program and that the dlink 652 could not be operated without it. The only thing dummer than tech support at dlink was the idiots at norton who crashed my computer and could not fix it."
3,Johnny & the Distractions--My Desire,"When Johnny & the Distractions roared through the Northwest here back in the early 80's, they literally tore through the region. They flooded the local Seattle airwaves for a few glorious years.Most of the material on 'My Desire' (7) are re-recordings of songs from their '81 vinyl 'Let It Rock' (which rocked full throttle without a clunker in the bunch-all gems). While the performances here were done many years after the originals, the 'hearts on their sleeve' passion of youth is gone. Don't get me wrong, these are very good performances, and for any fans of Springsteen/Seger/heartland rock, this is a welcome addition.Perhaps A&M will one day give the Distractions their due & issue their early stuff on a comp, perhaps with some of Koonce's '83 solo material. They were both good songwriters & performers. The Distractions deserve a good catalog representation because, when they were young and hungry, they cooked."
2,not complete episodes as originally televised,"I was expecting the complete episode from each show, but it was obviously edited and left out some of each show that originally played on television and i am a disappointed. What it did show is classic Dean Martin."
2,Not up to Webb's standard.,"A disjointed begining, coupled with constant use of unexplained Vietnamese words really hurt an otherwise good book. The word ""cyclo"" was used to excess and was always in italics. I don't have a clue as to why Mr. Webb did that.After reading, and loving, his other books, this one was a disappointment."
4,A refreshing look at Vietnam,"I found this book extremely enjoyable for several reasons. It had very few characters and a simple plot that made the story easy follow. It painted a picture of Southeast Asia and its culture. Especially Vietnam, which has been an enigma to me since I was a young boy watching my uncles go off to the Vietnam war. It is a good mystery, with enough suspense and humor to keep you turning the pages."
3,Not as compelling!,"Not as compelling as his previous works such as "" Fields of Fire."" Somehow there is something missing in his character developemnt. Perhaps if he had given a little more background it might have worked better.The book slows down about two thirds of the way thru and has a hard time regaining its momentum. The idea of Soviet forces advising NVA and VC Cadres inside the Republic of South Vietnam, as well as MIA's, Turncoats, the CIA all offer wonderful chances breaking new ground on certain aspects of the American War in South Vietnam.I will continue to buy Webb's books , even when a new effort is not up to muster. At his worst , he far exceeds other efforts."
5,Excellent choice,"This kit is a great value. The 14.4 volt is not too heavy to use all day. The hammerdrill is perfect for sinking 1/4"" plastic anchors in masonry."
2,Dinner at Elaine's,"I have all of Wood's books, look forward to his latest. This was a total disappointment. With all the violence,there is always - meet you for dinner at Elaine's. Too cute for me this time, it did not hold me at all. Stone has become a dinner magnet - everyone asks - dinner tonight?? I'll just wait until Woods gets back to writing about real characters as he did when he stared out."
2,Disappointing,"While this book was a quick, easy read, I found the many of the events far-fetched and rather unbelieveable. Weak character and plot development. Disappointing."
3,Not the best Woods work,"I agree with others who were disappointed with this one. A little too out there. His books are quick and entertaining to read almost regardless, but some earlier books are much better. (My personal favourite is Imperfect Strangers)"
4,Could be better,"I like Stuart Wood's writing style - it is light with good homour. His books are interesting and fast read. However, I have the impression that the author generally doesn't put much effort into his stories, as if he had to make a deadline and finish the novel on time. I'd also like the stories to be more realistic as they often read as fables... This review applys actually to all the books by Stuart Woods that I read. I finished Two Dollar Bills just yesterday, and I think that the novel would be much better if the author gave some more effort.Another easy and fast reading, I suggest, isHugger Mugger (Spenser Mysteries (Hardcover))"
2,TOO MUCH SEX AND FOUL LANGUAGE,I am at a loss as to why Stuart Woods finds it necessary to use such foul language as well as so much explicit sex in his books. His stories are good and really don't need the language used. The female US Attorney of New York wasunblievably bad. Can't imagine her being able to keep her job with the stupidthings she did.I suppose I'll buy more of Wods' books but do wish he would clean up his act abit.
1,Marginal story line and factually incorrect,"A barely passable story line until it got to the bit about flying a helicopter, then it got worse. The author obviously did NOT even begin to research flight and his description of the controls and flight were laughable - perhaps joke would be better.Sad."
5,Excellent Book and well written,I am currently studying for my MCSE and I have found this book to be easy to read and understand. I have read few other books on NT (exam cram and sybex)and these books do not even compare to this one. Most of the books out there are full of technical as well as grammer errors. I found this book to be right on. The authors do a great job explaining and giving you step by step instructions in PLAIN ENGLISH. I highly recommend this book for anyone that is serious about NT!
2,"A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction","After skimming this book it seems to me that it is a book about building theory and how buildings fit together to make a community. Definitely not my thing. I'm not saying it is a bad book, it just isn't my thing."
1,Do Not buy,this is the worse product ever do not buy.... if you don;t belived buy and see yourself.. I call the companhie and not good customer service too
4,2nd one I've bought,"I bought one of these several years ago and it's held up very well. I needed to repay a bunch of favors a friend did for me recently, so I bought her one of these. She tells me she really likes it and uses it all the time. The reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that these are a little light weight. People who would be using a pressure cooker more than my friend and I may want to go to a stainless model. They cost more, but would probably give longer service. However, there's NOTHING wrong with these units. They do everything you'd expect them to do. One thing though . . .when cleaning them, be careful to not drop or traumatize the edges as they ARE a bit fragile."
5,Perfect size and weight,"I love this pressure cooker and I've used it 20 times before this review. I bought one for my sister and my mom I liked it so much. The bottom part is dishwasher safe, however, if you don't put it in the dishwasher it will stay shiny. I chose the aluminum over the stainless so it would be lighter in weight. It is the perfect weight for me. It heats quickly, but has not scorched anything. It is also a great size. I had a smaller pressure cooker and needed something bigger."
3,Scratched glass stove top,"I purchased this about a week ago, and the first time I used it, it scratched my glass stove top. It left 3 scratches and a small gouge. Why does this happen on glass stove? I haven't had any problems with any of my other pots or pans, I use Calphalon and LeCruest. I was extremely careful not to slide it, but may have a little bit just out of habit. Otherwise, it worked great and my roast beef came out tender and delicious, but now I can't used it anymore, I don't want to cause more damage to my stove."
4,So far so good,"We've been using it for half year. It's works great and stable, though you need to take some time to heat the entire cooker."
4,"Good Valve, gasket, screw for Handle","Overall quality of the material is satisfactory. The gasket is black rubber and compared to presto is smaller. But it served the purpose very well. It comes with cap-handle with two screws, and body-handle with only one screw. So, after using it for weeks, the screw might loosen up and needs to be tightened again. Besides that all is fine."
4,good thing for the price.,this pressure cooker works good if u have to get the dinner done quickly and don't have time for the meat to get tender. works great for all traditional Pakistani/Indian recipes. and i would recommend the 6 qrt than the 4 qrt. it works well. but i did have some trouble getting rid of the stains on the aluminum.
4,Presto pressure cooker,The pressure cooker works fine. If it lasts 30 years like the previous one I will be very happy?
5,A great Blues Rock cd,"I came across this band searching for other cds on Amazon- They were captivating. Good singing, good guitar. How I missed them, I do not know, but it set out a quest to find as much as their cds as possible. Some seemed to be drying up or used only at a high price. Suffice it to say, it it a band you like or do not like. I purchased every cd I could find on Amazon or thru their sellers. I have not been disappointed in 1 cd. I am missing 1, so I will keep hunting. Listen to their samples on Amazon or Allmusic . Com a great discography site. When in doubt, get it- I was keeping a Buddy Guy on the back burner, & I come back a week later & its over $100.00. Thats how quick stuff dries up. Too Slim is a great band- get what you can find from Amazon- i suggest not waiting. I will leave review of tracks to those much more knowlegeable than myself & thank them for their reviews- they have helped me- Thank You"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!! She is a FRAUD!!!,"I had a so called ""reading"" with Stacy a couple of years ago. For someone who is claims to be ""psychic"" this is laughable - she did a TAROT reading!!! Not one of the things she said would happen to me has happened yet to date. All the information she gave me during the reading was incorrect. If you want an ACCURATE, dead-on reading then go to Chip Coffee. He was ONE HUNDRED percent correct even giving me the names of deceased relatives and my medical info. that no one else could have known.Stacy claims to be a psychic but cannot even give a correct, accurate reading even with TAROT cards! don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Watered down ""Thing of Beauty""","No one can say that the life of Gia Carangi wasn't tragically fascinating--especially the author of this book. Unfortunately it takes him around the corner to the milk store and back until he makes his point. This book is over 400 pages long, and although it's well-written and documented, it could have been at least 100 pages shorter. Stephen Fried has definitely done his homework, but this book feels more like a documentary of the 70's fashion world than a biography of Gia. He goes a bit overboard in detailing EVERY SINGLE person in Gia's life and it gets frustrating for the reader who really doesn't care much about every hairdresser, photographer or lunch lady that ever entered Gia's life.For those of you out there that are interested in every aspect of 70's fashion--read this book, you'll love it. For those of you who could care less--you might want to skip this one."
2,Is this about Gia or all the people around her?,"I bought this book because I wanted to read about Gia. Not her agents, hairstylists, photographers and various other people. It seems that Gia is only mentioned in a few paragraphs of each chapter. Personally, I don't want to read about the details of the aforementioned people's lives with the exception of Gia herself. This book would have been a much more enjoyable read with a few hundred less unimportant pages. I found my mind wondering off while reading the book because there is little mention of Gia through many of its chapters. I hope that someone else writes a book on Gia and leaves the focus on Gia."
4,A tragedy even sadder because it could've been prevented.,"Fried did his homework well. The facts of Gia's life were very detailed, her life certainly was sad and tragic. It was a great book, well researched and written, but a bit on the cold, factual side when what I think we would RATHER have was a book that Gia wrote herself about her life, her feelings, her pain. However we know that is not possible as Gia was not capable of writing such a book. The tragedy of it all makes you wish you can go back in time and step in and help. Her life didn't have to go in the direction it did."
4,Thing of beauty,"I bought this book used. It was in good shape when I got it. There was a tare on the page and that was it.I have only read some of the book and I can already tell this book is amazing! I cannot put it down!I had just gotten it a couple days ago and ive already read about a 3rd of it, through my busy scedudle and everything. Its crazy how on point the movie was with Gias real life. If you love the movie you will really love this book!"
1,Unbelievably Poor,"I read approximately 2/3 of the way through this book. While it's amazingly well-substatiated, Mr. Pfeffer has used numerous resources to state his case.Unfortunately, the position he takes is about 180 degrees out of whack with the position taken by those who founded our nation!Nothing like rewriting history..."
4,Another world...,"Lucky Strike transports us to the last great ""rush"" the Uranium Rush of the 50s, when anyone with a giger counter could go spelunking for that radioactive gold. It's always amazing that this ""other world"" existed right smack in the middle of our own country, but it's a life that was harder and stranger than any of us can imagine when we add a couple scratch-off lottery tickets to our bread and milk at the grocery store. Nancy's characters breathe the radioactive air right up through the pages, but of course you don't have to wear your lead-lined boxers to enjoy this adventure."
1,Not very sturdy,"Looks like a good product, the dividers that it comes with are not very sturdy though. Also didn't have a firm fit within the container. Ornaments were falling through the sides because of these problems. I bought another kind that didn't have these issues. They should probably try out the product before putting it on the market."
2,make something similar at home,"Overpriced. Surely somewhere online you can find a pattern for how to make the (flimsy) inserts, make them yourself out of a sturdier cardboard, and size them to fit any plastic box you can buy for $5. I'll be doing that when I need another.The box itself is fine."
2,"If you've already read step by step, DON'T get this book!","Taking the advice from the other's who reviewed this book, I bought it. Although I'd just finished Step by Step for Project 2000, I was looking for more concepts and principles behind PM for executives. This book was nothing more than a refresher for me. Its poorly written and the average user picking up a MS Project book for the first time would be lost. Stick with step by step books...."
5,Photography is more than just beauty,"Being a photographer and a photojournalist, this video helped me to refouse on why do I take pictures. The video is not just a documentry on the history behind some of the most famous photographs that changed our views on how we look at our world, it represents the the most foundamental aspect of photography, emotions. It's a must see video for everyone who wants to have a deeper understanding of photography and life in general."
3,U can get this cheaper directly,This product took over two weeks to arrive. But worst of all it came in a three pack for 18.95 with out shipping.they are 12.5 ounces per PAC . U can order this product directly from mrbeer for 3.50 per PAC u do the math it's the same 20030 booster.
1,Dreadful,"This book did have technically accurate and well-crafted cross-examination scenes.However, the characters were cardboard caricatures. Psychological changes came about in ways that were too abrupt to be believed. The lawyers, without revealing any plot twists, behaved in ways that no ethical lawyer _could_. The computer comments were laughably inaccurate at times (a small gray box described as a ""Norton Utility"" with a straight face). It's hard to believe that the author is really a lawyer, unless someone else wrote everything but the courtroom scenes. Even the scenes in chambers with the judge didn't ring true. This book mostly reads like a layperson's dream of what being a big-time criminal defense lawyer would be like.You would be better off reading a Scott Turow novel if you are looking for a legal thriller, or even a John Grisham one."
2,Writing Style and chracter development could be better,"Letter of the Law started with a good premise, but the author's style made it not live up to its potential. Each chapter included multiple voices of charcters and provided insight into the thought of each chracter. Because of this, the book was not very suspensful, with a couple of exceptions. The killer in this novel was also not presented as diabolical as he could have been and therefore did not add that much to the suspense. I especially did not like the mentality the author gave for why the killer was doing what he did. It was very unbelieveable and should have been in an x-files episode. Any person who is seasoned in reading legal thrillers and other suspense novels will be disappointed in the simpleness of this novel."
3,not his best,"this is easy to read,entertaining,but not as good as his last two or three....but good enough to warrant trying his next one."
5,FINALLY! A PRODUCT THAT REALLY WORKS!!,"Super gross flying and jumping ants were starting to take over. Raid was a very temporary fix.Here is what works: Spray Terro aerosol against the walls (inside and outside) and for prevention, put down Terro ant bait traps. That should be the end of the ant problem.I am very, very happy with this product."
2,Kong air dog squeaker,My labs had the tennis ball skin on this toy peeled off in the first day. Not the quality that I expected for an item that carried the Kong name.
1,dog toy,LOUD squeaker..drives me nuts..also my dogs chewed the green covering of the first day!! will i buy again??? NOPE
4,"Great, durable toy!!","My dog is a power chewer, despite her small size. She has destroyed red Kongs and various other toys marked for strong chewers. This particular toy though, lasted a lot longer than normal, as would a regular tennis ball. My dog loved throwing it around, shaking it as if it were prey, and the squeaker is an added bonus (even though it can get quite annoying).Despite puncturing holes in it with her teeth, it was still very much in playable condition. We only throw it out once our dog starts to pull off the tennis ball fur and eat it, and then lots of the fur start coming off or sticking out.Basically, if your dog likes tennis balls (and those fare somewhat well for you) then so would this particular toy."
1,Destroyed in minutes by puppy,Not at all durable as advertised - puppy tore apart immediately and this was just a waste of money &#128530;
1,"Made in China, May be Dangerous","I purchased this Kong Dumbbell for my Alaskan Malamute. She loved it and licked it more that she chewed it that first day, but the next morning she had a seizure. This is the only time she has had a seizure, and it may not be related to this product, but I am curious if anyone else had a similar experience. The product is made in China, not the US as is stated in the description.I am going to try to have the product tested and I'll update this post if I am successful."
2,Lasted an hour,"Great squeaker. After an hour our bull mastiff had torn off the cover. Nice hard tennis ball ends, but it has to last more than an hour."
3,Not for strong chewers,"I bought this toy for my puppy. He is a strong and aggressive chewer. He had this for less than 5 minutes and had already destroyed it. It seems very durable for an average chewer, but do not buy if you need the most resilient toys. The felt is easily torn off, and the rubber underneath does not stand up to any chewing."
4,My dog loved it,"We picked this up for our new dog who loves bones. He loved catching it, bouncing it to catch it himself, and simply chewing on it. The squeaker (sadly) lasted almost as long as the toy, which bit the dust 3 months later after he had chewed off the outside material. It never got lost, either, unlike most tennis balls."
2,Quickly Chewed Doggie toy,"I purchased the Air Kong Squeaker dumbbell for a friends small dog. The dog is only about 9 months old and weighs about 15 lbs. My friend indicated that 10 minutes after she gave him the toy he had chewed it up. The insides were hanging out etc... I had hope the toy would have lasted much longer then that, but unfortunately it did not. If you have a dog that is a chewer, this is not the toy for him or her."
1,My puppy destroyed it in 48 hours,I ordered this and the Wubba Kong toys for my 6 month old Lab mix puppy. He had both ruined within 48 hours. What a waste of money.
3,Kong dumbbell toy,The product has held up very well. Not like a typical hard rubber Kong toy. The dogs chew up the tennis ball material quickly.
3,Maybe for dogs that aren't such hard core chewers,"I got this for my 4 mo. old English Bulldog puppy hoping that it would withstand his teething and strong jaws. Unfortunately, it didn't. Within a couple of days he had chewed off the felt covering and was trying to eat it. I had to take it from him so he wouldn't choke."
2,Wish it was as strong as other Kong Toys,My 10 month old Boston Terrier/Pit Bull puppy tore it up.Day 1: A Great fetch toy and bounced like crazy.Day 2: No longer squeaked. Still bounced.Day 6: One end completely chewed off.Day 8: Only bits and pieces of florecent yellow rubber all over the floor.Wish it lasted longer. Her other kong toys are over 2 months old and show very little wear and tear.
5,Vintage Sacks,"Doctor Oliver Sacks was an amazing person. If we had more like him, who was willing to explore and experiment, maybe we wouldn't have any diseases today!"
1,For simple cooking-look elsewhere!!!,"I bought this book after reading that it was supposed to be a good source of simple easy to prepare meals.... NOT! The ingredients are tough to find and the fancy recipes aren't at all close to ""everyday cooking"". You'll have more chest pain trying this book than a whole case of deep-fried cheesesticks could ever cause!"
2,How many books now?,With all the books and tapes this author has produced how did he have the time to research them. Like All fads he has passed already.
3,Disappointing,"I read this book with a lot of enthusiasm but found it essentially disappointing. The theme was interesting but I found the lead character of Yuichi Minami to be dislikeable and selfish. He seems the antitheis of the Japanese ideal. Mishima protrays him as a ""beautiful"" young man with little charm. All the characters who become involved with Minami(both male and female) fall for his beauty and instantly become infatuated. However, I couldn't understand his continued appeal after his uncaring treatment of them. I kept expecting/wanting bad things to happen to him. It seemed that his good looks alone carried him through his aimless, debauched life. At times I felt disgusted by his behavior. The ending was unexpected and twisted but I felt that Yuchan should have received a more ""just"" reward. I think it was worth reading and I would like to read more books by Mishima since I'm interested in Japanese culture."
1,Awful Condition,"I ordered this CD through Amazon, and was under the impression that it would arrive in 'very good' condition, as advertised. This was far from true. In my opinion, it wouldn't even qualify for 'poor' condition. The case has numerous scratches and it looks as if someone tried to drill a hole through the back of it. The CD itself has water spots on it, and the pamphlet on the inside cover looks like someone dropped it in the tub. It's stiff and the pages are stuck together. It gets a 0 out of 10 for appearance. This was my first 'used' purchase, and may be my last. I care greatly about the appearance of my belongings, and knew that I would need to make some exceptions for a used item, but this is pathetic. I've never had problems with Amazon before - I know they can do better than this.In Due Time"
5,Awesome New Band,These guys have a great sound and add to modern rock. These guys ARE NOTHING LIKE CREED OR ALTERBRIDGE So stop referring to them. In my opinion they are better than Alter Bridge because they have more metal influences in them. The singer can scream and he can scream good which is something Creed never does. Pick up this album.
1,"I tried to like it, but was incredibly disappointed.","Like another reader, I was excited to get a book which was so critically acclaimed. However, I kept waiting for a character to draw me in, a scene to excite me, something to happen to keep me interested, and I never got any of it.Perhaps it is an British vs. Yankee thing, but this novel was incredibly boring to me. There were moments of great writing and prose, but not enough to carry the book. Claire was superficial, whiney, and so stupid that I had no cause to like her. Tristan was a spineless pet without any likeable charactoristics. Paul, I wanted to like, but I just didn't find enough depth in his charactor to become attached to him, either. Rachel was just a witch, and to be honest, I'm not really sure why she was even in the book, except to have someone else to torture poor Tristan.Skip it."
1,exasperating and eventless,"When I read the prior reviews to this book, I was really excited to get my hands on a copy. I was gravely disappointed. Instead of an exciting tale I read endless pages of exasperating flowery drivel.The characters are all unlikeable. Claire a self-centered tease has no brains or compassion when it comes to her faithful lapdog Tristan. And Tristan is just that, an ignorant lap dog with nothing better to do than to pine away for someone he has no chance of getting.The story is DULL! Nothing happens in the book. Things are told in retrospect and never is active in any way. It's just pages of how the lap dog feels about his Claire or how Claire feels about Paul or her lap dog. My IQ dropped a few points after reading this terribly written book. If you like pointless drivel, this book is for you. I recommend this book for anyone who has insomnia, because it will put you to sleep right away."
4,"Tough boots, waaaaaay too big.","Unlike the previous reviewer, I found these boot to be pretty well made. They've held up great for over a year. The only real wear is in the interior of the heel but only because I still should have got another half size smaller and my heel tends to slip when walking. I just got tired of exchanging so I put a sport insole inside to snug them up a bit more. The sizing does run unusually large though. I normally wear a size 8.5 or 9 but in these I wear a 7. Last time I fit into a size 7 shoe I was about 11 years old. So aside from the obvious sizing problem, I'm very happy with them. I bought them primarily for riding but I liked the looks of them so much I were them casually quite often as well."
1,Axe to Grind? Ommisionist History? You decide.,"It would appear that the two authors have some kind of axe to grind against the NYPD. If one is to believe this book, all New York City cops are corrupt, or inept, or just lucky bumblers who when they do solve a crime, do so by sheer luck. This is omissionist history at its worst. As an insider in the NYPD I feel I know what I am speaking about. These two authors seem to be the type of person who, once having been denied entrance to the police department, set about tearing it down. It is a one-sided look at the police department, with absolutely no in-depth look at how the ""job"" actually works. Don't waste your money on this tripe."
4,Detailed to say the least,"I have to say this text is very interesting but not clear at all times. It's got loads of information jammed into a book that's rather thin for a college text but it's very informative. My only problem? It's so detailed that you can barely make out what any of it means. Also, the glossary is not as complete as it should be, but it does give plenty of latin prefixes and suffixes to help aid in the translation of scientific jargon. If they had put in about five or so more chapters (or at least that amount in pages) they could have explained confusing concepts more and avoid just jamming as many neurocranial bones as they can figure out in one paragraph."
5,this cd rocks!,"ahhhh they might be giants.......<one> of the few good bands to come out after 1979.....and this album just proves their greatness. I love the song ""Don't Let's Start"", I gurantee you'll be singing it all day long. My second favorite song on the album is ""Ana ng"" which is a beautiful song. This album is awsome! it shows tmbg at their finest. If you don't buy it, you're missing something!"
2,The songs from their Lincoln CD were the best from this era!,The cd set clearly shows that they were terrible at first but then started improving after their 2nd album. Most of the ep and bonus songs were also terrible and only ensane or drunk people can possibley enjoy any of them. Save your money and get the Lincoln and Flood albums instead.
5,A nice collection for TMBG fans!,"Then: The Earlier Years is a nice collection for either casual or die-hard fans. Not only does it compile their self-titled debut album and later album Lincoln, but it also comes with several dozen bonus tracks and EP B-sides. There are a few remixes and demo versions of their songs that are rather cool, and some other tracks that are sure to become new favorites (such as ""Become A Robot"", a personal favorite of mine). I bought this to replace a copy I'd purchased in high school and have since lost due to unforeseen circumstances, and I haven't regretted it once.The inner booklet also has some background info on the Johns, how they met and formed the group, and information on many of the songs. A very informative read! There are also lyrics, tons of pictures, as well as pictures of the original release singles art."
2,Money Grubbers!,"What is this? .....by the Presleys. Are you saying, WE knew Elvis and you didn't? (Would E approve of Michael Jackson OR that make-up-your-own-religion church of yours?; I don't, so I'm one up on you). The songs on this superfluous package are so random as to be distracting. If you actually HAVE the rights to Elvis' music, your selections sucks. If these are ALL the songs you have the right to, you have what the birdy left on the post."
2,USED To be my favorite graham cracker!,"I wrote the company to tell them about how I did not like the changes they made a couple of years ago to this product. The texture and quality are different and the packaging has changed, and NOT for the better. This WAS our family's favorite graham cracker. They told me they changed production and there was no going back to the old way. Too bad, they lost a customer. Also, the last case I received went rancid before the expiration date. I store these in my pantry, which is cool and dry. Not sure why that happened, but it was a waste. They also arrive very cracked and broken, due to the way they are packaged. I won't be buying these anymore."
4,"good, healthy snack will assuage hunger pangs","No, these don't taste like regular grahams. They taste a lot like wheat germ and whole wheat. They are an acquired taste for many people. They are quite dry so if you like a dry shortbread cookie, you'll probably like these. I really like having a bag of them in the car, for when I get really hungry. They satisfy without making you hungrier, which some of the other mentioned WW grahams (esp those bunny ones) do! Yes, they come in broken a lot, even from the market, but that's because of their dry nature, not Amazon. However, I do agree with a couple of reviewers who claim the taste has changed over the years. I agree. I wrote the company & they said it hadn't, but they probably changed/improved the oil or something, for the ingredients are all really healthy ones."
1,MI-Del 100% Whole Wheat Honey Grahams,The entire case was stale & broken into bits. I will never buy this brand of crackers again.
1,Very Salty!,"Why do they taste so salty? Because they are packed with salt: 230 grams of sodium (that's 9% of your recommended daily value!!) in four not-that-huge crackers. That's just silly (oh, and unhealthy).Years ago, these were my favorite graham crackers. Then, Mi Del reformulated them and made them oddly lemony and salty. I can not eat even one!There are better whole wheat crackers out there. For example,Health Valley Crackers, Graham Amaranthtaste better and are lower in sugar, not to mention sodium, too.P. Gould, co-author of Feeding the Kids: The Flexible, No-Battles, Healthy Eating System for the Whole Family (Fork and Spoon Field Guides)"
2,Broken crackers,"The Honey Grahams are excellent. Not sweet like white-flour grahams, but filling and satisfying since made with whole wheat flour. I make 3 peanut butter + graham cracker cookies per day (with other goodies) and they are very satisfying.My problem is the packaging. I'm just finishing a pack of 12 16-ounce boxes and there was not 1 box with unbroken crackers. Box after box after box after box of broken crackers.Mi-Del needs to package them in larger boxes and to cushion them with shipping materials such as bubble wrap--3/16"" x 175ft x 12"" BUBBLE WRAP ROLL * SMALL BUBBLESor packing peanuts--2 Bags Green Loose Fill Shipping Packing PeanutsMi-Del should also have the word ""FRAGILE"" printed on the cartons so they are not tossed or handled roughly by shipping & receiving.These are great graham crackers with no sugar and with no white flour. I hope my enjoyment of them and my subscribe-and-save via Amazon is not sabotaged by Mi-Del's lackadaisical shipping."
1,Don't bother,This is as bad a book as I have try to read in a long time. I would have to see to believe the good review it suppose to have from The L A Times.Reader in California
3,If you want a great book in this genre read Kleier or Rustad,"This is an okay read, if rather difficult to swallow in parts. The best thriller I've ever read in this genre is Kleier's THE LAST DAY. Also good is Rustad's TRIUMPH AND GLORY. Folsom's story is too contrived. THE LAST DAY, by example, is a nerve-racking rollercoaster ride with bite--and with a message that sticks with you. If you want substance, as well as first class entertainment, I highly recommend Kleier or Rustad."
1,Tell Me Allan Folsom Isn't Catholic!,"I'm a pretty devout Catholic who loves suspense novels, so when I saw ""Day of Confession"" I was thrilled. Unfortunately, disappointment isn't strong enough to describe my feelings after finishing the book. Offended might be a better word.A meglomaniacal cardinal planning murder on a massive scale? A nun who has sex? Complicitous cardinals whose only concerns are ascending to the papacy? And my only hope for a redeeming clergyman revealed in a surprise twist to be something else? There wasn't a shred of faith, devotion, prayer or priestly sacrifice among any of the religious characters. Except maybe for the Pope who is depicted as a naive simpleton manipulated by evil cardinals.I have no problem suspending some amount of disbelief for the sake of the plot. I'm even willing to accept evil in the Vatican leadership for the sake of the plot, but at least give me some sense of balance to make the story somewhat believable."
4,Allan has made a fan out of me!,"I had never read any of Allan Folsom's books until 'The Day after Tomorrow'. I really enjoyed it, but after I read this one 'Day of Confession' I knew I was snake bit. It was worth reading every page and keep my interest all the way. He has a great way on ending his books. You don't want to miss this one. I must recommend this book to you. I could easily see a movie made out of this one."
4,"If the Addisons put on a show, the Vatican's gonna blow!","An explosive book to say the least.Plenty of characters and plot twists. Not as believable a plot as 'The Day After Tomorrow' but no less fun to read. This story was an absolute page turner thanks to Folsom's brilliant fast paced writing style. An interesting exploration into the Vatican walls. The thrills and stunts are a dime a dozen and you'll catch yourself looking over your shoulder for the infamous international killer Thomas Kind. Harry, Elena, and Danny drive the story but Roscani gets the Oscar for best supporting character. A thrillride of a book."
2,Editing? We don't need no stinking editing.,Is this a rough draft? I cannot believe that this book was actually read by an editor. Typos and extra or missing words everywhere. And anything that is old is described as 'ancient' ~ 36 times.
3,My confession: It's not worth your time.,"Day of confession starts beautifully. The Cardinal Vicar of Rome is assassinated at a celebration with the Pope. However, from thereon the plot descends into banality.Thomas Kind hardly measures up to the numero uno of assassins, Forsyth's Jackal. With his omnipotence, Cardinal Palestrina bears a closer resemblance to God than to the devil. Even the companionship between the nun and Harry is improbable.Simply put, the novel is malnourished, lacking the nutrients needed to keep it afloat.By the end, the reader has the feeling that Allan Folsom kills his characters when their utility is exhausted, instead of when the plot demands.The Day of Confession should be avoided unless necessary."
4,Quite Good,"After reading ""The Day After Tomorrow"" three yearsago, I have frequently checked the upcoming new releases looking forhis next book, so when I saw that ""Day of Confession"" was coming out, I certainly was excited. After reading it I must say that I wasn't as enthralled with it as I was with ""...Tomorrow,"" but it was still a good book. The plot needed some fone tuning, in my opinion, and the characters weren't built up as much as they were in Mr. folsoms previous book. My final comment is that while the ending of ""...Tomorrow"" was a good cliffhanger, the author went for that effect in the end again, but came up a bit short. . . Overall, I thought it was a fun read that should be picked up by anyone who enjoyed Mr. Folsom's first book, and first-timers."
4,Great sticker book;goes with DK Pirate Book,Fun book- stickers match the photos in the DK Pirate book. Stickers are peel and stick; easy to remove. must use text to match sticker to location in book- more suitable for kids > 5 years old or with adult help.
3,this game stinks,this game would be fun but it is very hard to control if you arentpressing one of the arrow keys the girl just walks around and aroundand around .if you try to pick somthing up you endup picking somthingels up im 11 and i love love love horses and have absalutly no funplaying this game.ps DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS A WAST OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,What an AWESOME GAME this is!,"This is a really fun game! It's so fun how you can take care of your horses--feed, groom, put them in the pasture, ride, and more!If you win the competitions, you'll get a chance to get a new horse! And they all have different speeds--some slow, some fast, some jump more far than others...they're all so interesting!And if you don't take good care of your horses, they won't perform as well in the competitions. So you have to take good care of them if you want to win the competitions--and new horses!This is such a fun game, because it's YOUR responsibility to take good care of your horse.This is a great game--you should get it."
5,Shining like the stars they are!,"After their pretty neat Ratpack collection of songs on their sixth album Allow Us To Be Frank, Westlife return to their usual routes. Trust me, if you liked albums one to six, you should have absolutely no problem what so ever with this. My favourite songs are Amazing, Colour My World, Hit You With The Real Thing and Change Your Mind. Amazing - the best out of the bunch - is exactly what it says it is. It sounds alot like a Backstreet Boys (BSB) song to me. Speaking of which, Colour My World, was originally recorded by BSB, though their version is spelt color. It's a brilliant song, and they get their voices fairly high. Hit You With The Real Thing was a immediate suprise for me. This is Westlife like you've never heard them before. It's an uptempo number, though it's not like songs like Uptown Girl or World Of Our Own at all. Change Your Mind has a feel of 70s retro pop, and the other tracks are absolutely overwhelming aswell. Get this!!"
2,Woeful,"The most notable aspect of this recording is the deterioration of Rudolf Serkin's piano technique. He no longer seems to possess the ability to express himself through his fingers. Over and over again, it appears to be a strain on him just to maintain a regular tempo. Sonorities no longer appear to be chosen; they are just arrived at due to whatever Serkin is able to achieve at any given moment. Abbado really strains to hold things together. Often, in orchestral tuttis, Abbado feels the need to press forward, then has to slow down for Serkin's entrances, since the pianist is unable to maintain the orchestra's tempo. All of this has a derogatory effect on the London Symphony's playing, which is fairly drab and lacking in sparkle. The sound engineering captures all of these procedings fairly realistically, which may not be such a good thing. If you want to hear what Serkin could do with Mozart in his prime, search out his recording of Concertos 19 and 20 with George Szell."
3,no title,"This was quite a book, certainly different than anything I've ever read before. A thinly disguised autobiography by the host of a TV talk show ""Politically Incorrect"", which was on late at night. Maher presents himself and his fellow comedians as being unbelievably shallow human beings, more consumed with getting into a woman's pants than practically anything else in life. And these are men in their 20s, not teenagers. The language he used you couldn't even put in a movie these days. And that's going some. (Well, with the exception of ""The Aristocrats"".) However, it was well written (even if the author kept throwing in what I'm sure he thought were very erudite words just to make him appear smart) and I enjoyed it. It was alternately crisp, funny, bitter, and even at times very wise. About stand-up comedy."
1,People Think This Guy is Funny?????,"I had never heard of Bill Maher when I picked this book up about 4 years ago (I didn't get Comedy Central on my cable at the time), but I thought a book about comedy by a comedian would be, well, you know, comical. Far from it. I don't remember laughing at anything in the novel and the story didn't have a whole lot of meat to it. And the jokes were mediocre at best. It wasn't until Maher's Politically Incorrect hit the network that I saw him in action. He's a smart guy, but he can't tell a funny story or joke, either spoken or written. Sorry, Bill, but you're overrated."
4,Great product but don't recommend the Lemon Lime,"I adore Coromega. It's easy to take and, though it's hard to prove, I honestly feel like my mental health has improved since I've been taking it. I recommend against the lemon lime flavor, though. It is just SO strong that it becomes cringeworthy. The orange flavor is fine and I'm trying the chocolate orange next."
5,fish oil.,Love this alternative for people like me who need to take fish oil but cannot swallow the huge capsules. Thanks
2,Classic rock covered by MIDIs.,This album is like listening the background MIDI music on a 1996 Geocities site...it's the greatest and best reproduction of classic rock that can be achieved by the world's worst synthesizers.End result: rubbish.
1,Prop 65 Warning,Received this train and it had a sticker on it warning that it is made with a chemical known to cause cancer and reproductive problems in the state of California. Wish this warning had been posted in the description. I sent it back. Have found out since that several of Bachmann's trains have this warning on. There are other train companies that use better materials.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,I THOUGHT THIS CD WAS GOING TO BE FROM THEIR LIVE CONCERT...THIS WAS DONEIT SEEMS AT A STUDIO OR GOSPEL SHOW...I FEEL EVERYONE WAS THINKING THE SAMETHING...I FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD PRODUCE THE LIVE ONE FOR US TO PURCHASE
2,Don't buy this,When I purchased this DVD I was expecting to see the recording that they did in Houston in 2006 with DVD extras and stuff. This DVD is actually the recording that was shown on the Gospel Music Channel which can be seen on youtube. The only good performances were Looking to Get There and Jesus is a Love Song. Twinkie seemed that something was bothering her and she was very dazed and Jacky did NO leads. The Clark Sisters should have made it clear before the DVD even came out and have a bunch of people wasting their money that it wasn't going to be the recording with Donald.
2,"Nice book, not high on accuracy or factual information","This is a great coffee table book, with nice stories, but if you are looking for a pricing guide or a reference for vintage barware, this is not it. Many of his cocktail shakers have mismatched tops and bottoms, and there is little information on manufactures, makers marks, etc."
5,Fast and easy,Fast shipping. I hope this book will serve me for a better understanding of a girl I know.
4,Studio Guy,This is an easy way to transfer those analog videos to an editing work station. It may not be Hi end TV but it gets the job done.
1,Will Not Play On DVD Players,I am a professional engineer with six years of college and am pretty savvy on computers. After two days of effort I could not get the video DVD produced to play on any DVD player in my house. I was able to produce a good quality picture on a DVD in ten minutes but it would only play on the computer. No files were shown on the DVD to import to other Movie Makier programs. The software provided has dead end menus and no help. Customer servide requires the the navigation of tortuous labyrinths of inputs. I do not know how others managed but I am sending the damn thing back and getting a refund on my crdit card.
4,Works fine...I think.,Setup was easy and product seems to work fine. My older computer simply can't keep up with the video. Adhere to the computer hardware specifications for satisfactory results.
5,Amazing for the price.,"All I wanted to do was to be able to transfer some old garbage from some video tapes onto my PC. This works great! It has the hookups for either the old-school red-yellow-white connectors, as well as an s-video hookup. The input to your PC is a usb port as well as a microphone/line-in plug. The included software isn't pretty, but it works great. In less than 5 minutes you'll be recording garbage onto your pc! The video quality is EXCELLENT and you have a number of choices for quality, screen size, video format, etc. It's perfect. Great item. Highly recommend it!"
2,Too cheap to encode audio,"This device is only a video encoder. They just bring out the audio to a mini-jack which you get to plug into your sound card, so the sound gets recorded (in theory) from your sound card while the video gets recorded over USB.The problem with this (really cheap) approach is, you will find that after a while the audio gets out of sync with the video; ""your lips move, but I can't hear what you say."" Until maybe 50 milliseconds later, that is. That's because the audio card uses an onboard crystal timebase to set the audio sample rate, but the video encoder uses a sample rate derived from its internal timebase and sync'd to the video frame rate. These two items can and do vary. If you are recording from tape, especially old hi-8 camcorders, they can vary a lot.This is the CHEAPEST way to make a card like this and it almost never works. Buy something else."
3,be careful installing drivers!,"i'm actually only using the hardware with another piece of software. it works fine but gave me some trouble in the beginning because i installed the drivers wrong. make sure to follow the instructions in the manual! it's a roundabout way of installing drivers, in my opinion, but doing it their way works."
3,cute,Really cute but I can't get it to stay on our lab even though the size seems right. The head part with the ears keeps falling behind her ears. Adorable but I don't think it will stay on right for more than a quick photo.
3,Definitely a history lesson!,"If you want the basics, this is good. They break the fouth wall, so its not a movie in the sense of narrative (although there is an element of that) its more like a history lesson told by the people who were there, which makes it interesting, but can take you out of the story!!"
2,Catherine the Great,"I'm trying to remember one new thing about Catherine that I learned from this CD, and I cannot. I admit, I want to be entertained while I learn, and I found this CD be a boring documentary that did not really inform me about the subject or her country. There were no little personal facts that make you feel like you know something intimate about the subject. It felt more like a recitation from a cheap encyclopedia."
3,Garbo,"I thought the book was interesting but I was a bit disappointed with some of the author's personal opinions. I felt I had to read between some of the author's observations and would rather have just had the facts. However, I did enjoy the book and felt it portrayed Garbo in an honest light."
5,"If you're into subs, this DVD is for you","Fascinating documentary on the first nuclear subs. Included some facts I had not heard before. May not be for everyone, but if you're into Navy histroy, this DVD is a must for your library."
5,First book since childhood that I read two times,"Epic love story set during the construction of the convent at Mafra, now one of Portugal's most popular tourist sites. Sometimes the narration got to rambling and I had to reread passages. I didn't think the Passarola had any chance of flying so it was amusing when it did. The ending was so devastating, and it made me want to write a screenplay adaptation. Since childhood, I have never revisited a novel, even if it was one of my favorites. I found myself coming back to this one a couple of months after the first read. It really stayed with me."
1,READ THE BOOK MISSED THE VIDEO,"FEW YRS BACK I BELONGED TO THE BOOK OF THE MONTH CLUB AND HAD GOTTEN THE PASSOVER PLOT I DON'T REMEMBER THE AUTHORS NAME ONLY HE WAS JEWISH,& A PROFESSOR AT COLUMBIA U. IN NYCI LOANED IT TO SOMEONE THAT NEVER RETURNED IT IT MUST HAVE BEEN LATE 60s IT WAS QUITE INTERESTING FOOD FOR THOUGHT. I'M A ROMAN CATHOLIC AND IT DIDN'T CHANGE MY RELIGIOUS BELIEFS IN THE RESERECTION OF JESUS, , BUT IT WAS A INTERESTING CONCEPT I WOULD LOVE TO FIND A COPY OF THE OLD BOOK ALSO HOW CLOSE THE NEW BOOKS PLOT IS TO THE OLD ONE? IS THIS A VIDEO OR BOOK?"
4,Good book,very goood book for marketing students. i would say it is worth. the book explain kind of simple with examples
2,Ok,"This product works ok. It last me about a month before I need to change the filter, but the problem with this product is, I use a filter because I have a lot of minerals in our water and turns my hair orange. This product alone will not do a complete filter. My hair is still orange. But it does help a bit."
2,somewhat clever but still very bad,Even for true B5 fans this movie stinks. It's no wonder the series wasn't picked up. The actors are clearly amateurs and the premise is pathetic. The movie died when the weapons officer started punching and kicking at enemy ships in a hologram area or whatever. The whole thing seemed designed to appeal to Pokemon fans age 13 or so. It's definately not made for adult viewers.
5,The Unexplained...Explained,"This is a very good chapter in the B5 movies. It explains to us the Earth/Minbari war, which the show only skimmed over. I was also pleasantly surprised that it fit in with the original story. It had the person who thought he was King Arthur exactly where he was supposed to be. It showed how Sheraden destroyed the Black Star and the story of Delenn before B5. The only problem is it opens new questions that are only answered in the books."
4,"Not as good as TOS, but good all the same.","I enjoyed this ""pilot"" for a new series . . . which never took off. Not as good as Babylon 5 itself, but pretty good all the same. Maybe someday JMS will get another chance to do a series in the B5 Universe, and get a chance to explore this very exciting and hopeful vision of the future."
3,Criticism Aside,"I've watched all the B5 Material until the DVD start to ware thin. This is not that bad. I've seen worse on TV called TV shows that you should watch. Perfect? No, not by far, but with the proper guidance and thought - think we could have had another SCI-FI epic series. Too many of the quality SCI-FI go away or luckily moved to the SCI-FI channel. We often get stuck with what a network exec thinks is good. Rangers should have been given a chance. It had promise."
1,should be 0 stars,"I like cheesy science fiction to a fault. I've watched almost every bad science fiction movie from the 1950s to the present day, and enjoyed most of it. I like Babylon V; even the movies.This is the worst idiocy bar none I have ever sat through. It is a plot written by a 3 year old mental defective. I'd like to design instruments, to be built by ancient and highly skilled German craftsmen which would subject the people responsible for this atrocity to exquisite and artistic torments. The people who are responsible for this ""movie"" should be slowly turned inside out and their entrails sprinkled with hydrofluoric acid. Honestly, it cost me 1.5 hours of my life, and all of my self respect. Don't make the same mistake I did. In fact, buy this video and light it on fire."
3,Is it really Babylon 5 ?,"Don't get me wrong, I love Babylon 5. But this was hardly that. The only ties to B5 were cameo performances by J-Kar and a small role by Lennier. Every body else was new or unknown. Everybody.With that said and done the movie on it's own was pretty good, with some great sci-fi special effects. The sound quality was supurb and the picture quality was really good. I was just expecting some old friends."
1,Flimsy design,"I bought this not realizing that the floor of my shower had to be level to accommodate this bench, the shower floor slants towards the center drain. I have tried in vain to get it to work without rocking back and forth even setting the leg adjustments differently in the front. Also, the legs and the whole product do not seem sturdy. I am returning it and requesting a refund. The $70 fee was very high for such a flimsy product. Save yourself the money and purchase something better."
3,Watch out for seams,The purpose of this item is great and it is adjustale. The only problem we had was that it became unglued on the wooden seat. That made it wobbly and dangerous.
1,Worthless. Do not waste your time.,"This book is a joke. Everything you'll find in the book is described in far more details in the on-line help. I could not find any reference to 401K investments tracking, and the rest of the material was short and useless. Very few paragraphs are exceeding 10 lines of explanation and many of them advise you to follow the simple on-line instructions. Given that the author consulted Microsoft with the first version of Money, no wonder is was such a terrible product."
1,Save money NOW - don't buy this book ....,"If you are capable of reading and following the help provided by Money 2001 you do not need this book. I bought this book as it was the only one available at the time (big mistake).As an example let's take the Budget Planner section, three pages of text (including screen shots!) can be boiled down into the following sentence: -""Display the budget planner window, Use the Budget Planner Wizard!"" - Does the help file provide this level of detail or more? Yes!I agree there 'may' be some useful money advice but for use of Money 2001 the electronic help file is more use and it is even searchable for easy access to the subject you need when you need it!Ask the Expert? I can think of many more useful books to dedicate 3/4"" of my bookshelf space!"
2,Not the best option out there,"Used Vinylex for my Jeep top to try it. Product does a nice job of restoring shine to plastic and vinyl and it holds up well. Gave it two stars though, because when it rains, the run off from the vinyl roof coated with vinylex leaves streaks and a film on the windows. Too bad it does not run off the vehicle in a rain storm."
2,What cleaning?,Works good for turning vinyl looking new but supposed to clean as well? I could have rubbed with plain water and got same results as far as cleaning goes. Not worth the money if you are looking for protection and cleaning both. DH-60 is misleading cause it's not uv60 but maybe closer to UV-10 rating? I gave it below average cause it's supposed to do both clean and protect and jury still out on protect.Good luck
3,"Handy, but can open accidentally","I have had the Walgreens version of this little box for a couple of years. This new one appears minutely different, but you'd have to look closely to see the differences. Seems to be the same manufacturer. I bought this one because the Walgreens box would pop open when dropped on a hard surface. If the box holds a bunch of cut pill fragments, they scatter everywhere. Picking them up, e.g. in an airport security line, is...embarrassing. Neither box opens when it is in your pocket. So, of course, the first thing I tested was whether this box will open when dropped. It did not open when dropped from pocket level, though the impact point I'm sure affects this. It did open when I tested from greater heights, i.e. greater impact speed. I don't see an alternative I like any better, so I guess I'll stick with this one. I use a cotton ball to keep the pills from sloshing around."
4,Pill boxes,These little boxes are really nice. Sometimes they don't stay latched so you have to be careful that they don't bump up against something in your purse or pocket but I really like the size. I couldn't find any pill boxes that were small enough. These are perfect for my meds when traveling - I don't have to carry large bottles.
5,Indestructo Pill Box,"I have been using these small but strong pill boxes for quite some time now and it's a very convenient way to keep my meds for the day with me all day while at work or while traveling. The pill box is small, but yet it can hold quite a few pills, varying in shape and sizes. I have had up to 10 different sized pill at one time in this small box. It is well build and can withstand the occasional drop onto the ground. My last pill box lasted 5 years before it came apart and I thing this was due to being in a very cold climate at the time and when dropping the box which cause the lid to separate from the box. But still, 5 years was well worth what I paid. When the box broke, I search everywhere in all the different drug stores and could not find this one particular type. I finally looked on the box itself and googled the manufacture's name and found it. So if your looking for a place to store your pills for the day, I highly recommend this product."
4,Nice but....,"These are handy and well-sized pill containers, but they are slightly pricier than others available on Amazon, some of which are made of aluminum unlike these which are made of plastic, which means the hinge is likely to fail over time."
3,Smaller than I expected,These are much smaller than I expected. It fits 4 pepcid complete chewables in it - but that's the max. I wanted it to hold a number of daily vitamins - but there isn't enough room for many...expecially if one is a large omega! I'll keep them to cart around a few antacids - but that isn't what I wanted them for.
5,Perfection,"I hate to see a beautiful book maligned. Lynn Kurland brings intense emotions, humour and sensuality to her stories in a way that simply eludes most of today's romance authors. I too hated it when Gwen was forced to marry Alain and Rhys sat outside her marriage room, but their forced separation made their story far more realistic to the times than most historical romances. Kurland manages to create characters that you can relate to and fall in love with (what a man Rhys is!) while remaining true to the time period she writes about. And, her stories are even more sensual and emotional because she doesn't include love scenes. In lesser novels, the lack of love scenes would make the romance feel forced and empty. But, in Kurland's novel, Gwen and Rhys's love is all the more intimate because they keep their bedroom life private. Kurland's novel is perfection that I have read several times. I will never tire of Rhys or Gwen (and her big ears)."
2,A little disappointing...,"I am a fan of Ms. Kurland's work and very much wanted to like this book, but it was disappointing. I found it so silly that all the drama and heartbreak could have been prevented if Rhys' grandfather had just told him the complete truth from the beginning (I don't want to ruin the ending for those who haven't read the book yet). And I also didn't like the fact that Gwen was given the role of ""dumb, helpless female"" whose schemes always cause more trouble then help, and then she would have to be saved by Rhys. The only character I liked was Rhys, and only because he was such a good guy and you felt bad for him. Poor guy, he deserved a better story."
5,I loved it!!,"This is the first book I've read by Ms. Kurland and I loved it. I thought it noble that Rhys would wait for Gwyen and do anything to make her his own. Thru all there troubles, they stood by each other and gave their love for each other freely. I was only dissapointed that Rhys never knew that Nicholas was his son. Overall, it was a wonderfull book."
2,Trying but not quite there.,"I read this book after hearing of it on an email list for another author. I was expecting the same type of writing...descriptive and completely engrossing. This was just okay; not nearly as well written as the books written by the other author. If you want to read WONDERFUL books by an author who is great with a good story, history, and romance, try Diana Gabaldon's 4 books beginning with ""Outlander""...they're the real thing!!"
2,I am not sure I will finish it.,"This is my first Lynn Kurland book and I am definitely not enthralled with the characters. I would have a hard time calling this a romance. I can see how she is twisting the formula, but it doesn't really work for me."
1,Yawn City!,"I was truly disappointed with this book. It was not up to the standards that Lynn Kurland set for herself. The story was flat and reading it was tedious. I was halfway through the book before it became slightly interesting, only to lose interest after a few pages. The only reason I didn't toss the book was because I don't like to leave things half done. I was really surprised at this ""Another Chance to Dream"", considering how wonderful her past books have been. I hope the next book that Lynn Kurland puts out will be better."
3,LED keychain,"My only complaint is that the light will not stay on unless I continue to press the button, which is not easy to do for more than a few seconds."
5,nice light for survival kits,I took a Wilderness Survival class the drove home the need for a pocket sized minimalist emergency kit. I was looking for a tiny flashlight since after the space blanket and fire steel striker there is not much room left. This served the purpose very well. I ordered a second one and will probably buy more.
1,FAKE - NOT Genuine LRI Photon Lights,These are not real LRI Photon Lights. They are complete counterfeit. I have owned several Photon lights and these do not compare. The LED is inferior. It is much dimmer than the real thing and the light itself is more blue than white. There is no Photon Branding on the back and the shape of the case is close but the plastic is thinner and shaped so they don't fit in the LRI holder accessories. Do not be fooled by these cheap knock offs. I failed to read the other reviews because I know the high quality that LRI Photon entails. If I had read them I would have seen the other reviewers that also received fake lights.
5,"Very Handy, Bright","I carry one of these on my keychain. This light is very bright for something so small. Since it is so small and convenient to carry, I find I have it with me all the time whereas I might leave a larger light at home. That means I have a light with me for unforeseen situations. For instance, very few people I know would bring a regular flashlight to a restaurant, but you probably have your car keys. For me, that meant that when the restaurant I was in went TOTALLY dark during a thunderstorm (seriously, not a single window), I was the only person in the place with a flashlight. And that's just one example. The best uses for this light often tend to be situations you could never plan for. The durability is good as well. I've been using this one for about 3 years with no problems, and that's impressive considering it gets thrown around with my heavy keychain and mashed against my other keys."
3,OK - but expect to send it back for a replacement often,"I have been buying these for several years, mainly because they have a lifetime guarantee (not covering the battery).They are bright and small. But inevitably the switch fails. It's just not a good design. You will press and the light will flicker on and off or not go on at all.I send them back to the company and they do replace them for no charge, but this is a hassle and I do have to pay to ship.I don't see a better alternative out there, but be ready for this."
1,I returned it once and exchanged it for the same item.,The light is extremely dim. I thought the first one was damaged but apparently purple just doesn't work in these lights.
5,it's all green to me.,excessively bright and just what I wanted. It can illuminate an entire room. I got the night vision green beam because I tend to lose too many things in the dark. It's as advertised. Just a little greener.
1,Definitely FAKE!!!,I am very familiar with photon lights and the ones I got from this listing were without any chance of doubt FAKE. What a rip-off.
