1,Do not buy this canopy,"Worthless. I used this canopy twice and two of the crossbars broke in the middle. The metal is extremely thin. I am extremely careful and take extreme caution with things like this. I even folded and kept the canopy top in a separate bag to protect it while traveling. Even being cautious, this piece of junk broke. This is a horrible design. I have a QuikShade canopy that I have used for many years and never had an issue with it. Stay away from the E-Z Up shelters, especially this one."
3,Average Book,Somewhat of a disappointment. I expected more variety of panini sandwiches. This is really a basic book that is average. If you wish to get more flavorful and/or complex panini's look elsewhere. Too much space is dedicated to bread and the recipes are lacking. Pictures are great!
3,ok movie,made for tv movie. not very much of a story line but it is just ok as far as production. once you have seen it you dont watch it again.
4,"Bought it for my husband, he loved it!","I bought this movie to give to my husband for Christmas. What's not to love, Willie Nelson and Chris Kristofferson, fun to watch :) Just wish it was on DVD! (thus the 4 stars instead of 5) We transfered it onto a DVD, but .... that does not make the movie high def. Still we had a good time watching it."
5,Good movie,It was a great movie. To me it was a classic. Willie Nelson is a great actor and play a good part.
4,One of his Better,Have 4 of his movies. This is one of the best. It has a sequal also. Makes you wonder if his character was a lot like him.
1,More theology pretending to be science,"As usual, mister Dembski desperately attacks evolutionary theory because it threatens his belief in a literal reading of the bible, and especially Genesis.You can tell a creationist by the way he attacks evolution using out-of-context quotes. Even years after having these illegitimate quotes pointed out to them, they continue to use them. Dembski is no different.The sheer dishonesty of creationists - and ID folks are just creationists wearing more modern clothes - is enough to make you wonder why they don't see the paradox of lying for your religion.Specified Complexity and intelligent design are all pseudo-scientific attempts to lend scientific credibility to creationism. The creationists real agenda has a simple objective: trash evolution to preserve the ""integrity"" of the bible. Everything else is waffle and window-dressing."
5,Great monitor,"I've been using this monitor for about 6 months now and love it. It is very versatile.It has a 4 port USB hub built into it which I use for my thumb drive and BlueTooth adapter. Both of which work perfectly. Two of the ports are on the left side of the monitor, with two more near the power cables.The stand that comes with it allows you to move the monitor up / down, rotate the screen so that it's sideways if you prefer that for really long documents, and has about 140 degree left / right movement.I have not tried the built in audio.It feels very solid and well built and the OSD menus are easy to navigate. Also, my unit has no dead pixels.Highly recommended."
3,Leaf...,I got this item for myself. I like it a lot. I personally wish it would be only one tone...but it's a nice piece of jewelry and I am happy with it.
1,Very Bad Acting!!,"I always fall for movies at Redbox. All of these actors must have been chosen off the street because the acting is terrible, I think porno's have better acting than this. Don't waste your time."
1,Don't judge by the cover,"Saw this in a red box and the cover looked cool, and the storyline seemed interesting. It wasn't. Wast of time, graphics SUCK. Now i'm not one to judge, i love a good B movie, but this was just...BAD. 90% is infront of a green screen, save for the beginning and end. Acting was 'ok'. do not buy nor rent this!!!!"
5,A course in make-up magic,"This was a great dvd. The instructions were easy to follow and it gave lots of different looks to try, not to mention loads of techniques to use to create your own looks... unlike other dvds that just give you 2 or 3 looks. This was more than worth its money and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to learn face painting...great for Halloween!"
2,"Good coverage, but very tight","I'm a medium sized woman. I wear size 8 pants, and these are so tight around the legs that they leave marks whenever I wear them. They've got good coverage at the knee, but unless you're a kid or a size 6 or smaller, they won't work for you."
5,"Foot Lexus, or Foot Cadillac if you are concerned about GM.","I have owned about 25 pair of ASICS and have never been more impressed with a shoe. I moved to Nimbus 8's then Nimbus 9's and have been VERY happy with their well cushioned ride. I run with a stiff insole (orthotic) so the shoe needs to take all the impact, and these shoes deliver. Very pleased."
2,Great product but need to be more descriptive,"Great sheet, but I was under the impression I would get two, the fitted sheet & the loose sheet but I only got the loose sheet. This should have been more specified."
4,Rebuilt is perfect except one part missing causing a lot of agravation,"Received my rebuilt 3000 psi Karcher G 3025 OH gas powered power washer. The pump and engine looked brand new. The hose, wand looked worn. I could not connect the hose to the high pressure output. Called Karcher and they said I was missing a quick disconnect. I sent them the requested documentation. Part never came. I called again and they said, no- I needed a new hose and they would expedite shipping. Now 16 days and part has not been received. I went to Home Depot and Lowes and a plumbing supply house and they could not provide the quick disconnect I am missing. Still waiting and not happy."
2,junk box,"When box arrived it looked like a disaster. I immediately took picture of damaged box. It looked like it was a used returned item that was shodily wrapped back up and tossed into box. There were some small parts missing, probably due to poor packaging and openings in box. I did not feel like going through the hassle of returning so I put it all together. I am kind of handy so I was able to find bolts, nuts and other fasteners to make things work. It is working but I was very nervous and upset for awile. I wish I would have just bought one at Sam's or simaliar store. It wasn't that much different."
1,Karcher CG190,"Piece of junk I called Honda World after reading about a gas additive to see if the had any just to make sure I didn't have any problem. The dealership side that sells presure washers said just get premium gas and I dont need an additive. Well it wont keep running and back fires. Now I'm going to have to tear it apart to get the gas out of the carborator (I'm hoping).Since I need a special tool, since this is made to be very hard to work on, also there are extremely sharp parts where you have to put your hand which will slice you up. I live in Oregon and its been rainy so I didnt get a chance to check to see if it worked right away plus I needed to waite until I could buy gas right before i used it.WELL MAYBE THEY SHOULD SAY ADDITIVE IS REQIRED OR AT LEAST SEND SOME WITH PURCHASE WITH AN WEB SITE TO BUY IT. Worst purchase I have ever made form the internet NO MORE HONDA FOR ME WHICH I USED TO SWEAR BY!!!!!"
1,Dosent seem to be the original,Had this earlier which had great smell for a small amount sprayed. The one bought from amazon is very diluted so you can hardly smell the perfume even if you spray a lot of it. Amazon delivered the item as expected and on time but I was disappointed with the product. Buy this off the shelf at a store.

2,Too strong for my taste,"This CK is really very strong, and gives me a headache. It was a mistake to get one online without trying in person."
4,"Not the best EDT, but good value for money","I use this on a daily basis. I have other EDTs for special occasions, and they are far better (but also more expensive).This product is good value for money"
5,Calvin Klein,Excellent. Product as described. I was amazed at how fast the item was delivered. Packing of product good. Would order again and recommend to others.
4,It's OK,"If this is a originally packed this is a good product for price. {I'm not saying it is not original, but dont have a way of telling it}."
4,A comedy of class and timing,John Cleese and Connie Booth star in this adaption of Chekov's play. Without dialogue and often without clothing the pair make their way through a variety of social and personal situations with a care which Miss Manners would appreciate.This is less slapstick than it is social commentary but hilarious none the less.
4,BACK IN THE DAY,"THIS IS A TREMENDOUS VIDEO SERIES. THE RACES ARE PUT TOGETHER VERY WELL AND THE OLD RACES ARE TRMENDOUS. I HOPE WE SEE A SEASON 2,3,4....."
2,good,informative and worth using. goes into detail and explains well. I did not need to use it very much. good dictionary.
5,The Official Dictionary of Mac OS X Leopard,NOAD is the on-board dictionary included on Mac OS X Tiger 10.4 and Leopard 10.5
3,Complemint,I found this book very respectable it was A very good help. I wish there were more books like it.
3,My reveiew,"I really want a dictionary on my Kindle Fire. I really enjoy learning the meanings to words. It was required for me to d this review, but I find that I really do like dictionaries."
3,Okayish,"It it is a good way to look things up, but it is hard to understand.But other than that,I think it is a great way to look things up."
3,Best dictionary ever !!!!!!!,A dictionary is good thanks love the words and information about the words. I wish I could make a good dictionary like you =^~^=
1,Chatzblue reviews,No interactive features for quick research. Can't type in look-up words. Makes you run to your hard copies. Not helpful.Can't delete book from kindle as yet. Delete prompt won't appear as with other books. Hmmm.
3,Interesting Book,"This dictionary is what you should read before you read any other books. It's so informative and helpful,and will help you understand what you read better. I recommend this to everyone."
5,I love it'd very much,My fav whas the reading part and dictionary part to my dad love this book too everybody love it too like me JAEDIAH K.N PARKS
2,Ok,I think this is great to have around u but how the book is set up.Make at least a few pics and just put it more like like organized with some spaces so thats my review!!
1,Boring,This was so boring.....at least make it fun...or a little interesting!!! **GRRR!! ~ make it fun!! U jerk faces!! Thanks for boring me 2 death
1,terrible,Terrible AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh i could barley understand what the whole point is you cant understand it and why have a dictoniary on your kindle when the make millions in the world!!!!!!
1,Terrible,"I think that if they are going to make a book for kindle fire, the interactive book reader, you should be able to interact with the book. In this dictionary, there should be pictures and be able to touch the word and it would show the picture, you are better off reading the paper old fashion book."
4,It is my favorite,Very very good i like this book because it tells me definitions to words. my favorite word is yo-yo and palindrome.
3,Critical stuff,It was helpful for me because it has all that you need to look smart and it would help you for collage
1,All words created equal.,"I only gave this book 3 stars because I don't like the fact that there were absolutely positively no kind of modern words or international words as well. I am not very fond of the way it was organized either, there should've been a table of contents where you could've chosen the letter section you wanted to go to..If you wanted to go to a D section there was a place in the table of contents for that same with the other letters of the alphabet.When I suggest that there be more international words in the dictionary I don't mean that there should be more European words in it, I mean I want more Japanese words more Arabic words"

2,Ok,"In the book, it says, WTF and some kids can have a kindle, and that is not right for them to learn that yet."
1,A dictionary,It was very good bookI don't like it because it is a dictionaryI would recommend it to anyone who wants to look something up
3,My complement,I think I like it because it lets you learn like if i say zebra I can look it up in the dictionary.
3,Excellent,Like it because it is the best thing I have ever read in my life so that why I like this one book
1,Dictionary,I'm young so this does not appeal to me. I guest it's nice to have a big word and by able to look up that word. But young people need better books. Learning is important. Better books with ideas and fantasies equal happy kids. Some say kids don't need ideas or we'll change the world. Sometimes change is good. Let us have our ideas! It is our own brain you know.
2,My review on Oxford American Dictionary,This dictionary is rather nice. It gives great example sentences. It is very cool with it's text speech. Love it!!!!!! :)

5,Really good,I that this is a really good book to find almost all words that you want to find. I almost told the whole words all about this amazing book. I think it is the bed t dictionary every.... trust me for real
1,worst ever,"This is the worst phone I have EVER owned. The reception was so bad no one on the other end could hear me talking unless I held very still and tried not to breathe. Not worth the money we saved, took it back and got a Uniden 5.8, and it rocks!!"
1,LCD is a MASSIVE fail,sound quality ok; battery life marginal but acceptable; lcd is a wretched mess that works fine for 6-12 months and then becomes useless & illegible. want to see that incoming caller's number? forget it after a few months. do not make my mistake: PICK ANOTHER PHONE.
1,not worth the money,"The phone is overpriced, after 2 yrs it cant hold battery life past a couple of minutes, after buying new batteries for all three phones we might as well just purchase a new phone. Also I keep hanging it up with my cheak when I try to use it hands free."
5,Amazing collection of impressive women,"I am so impressed by the stories collected in this first book. I love short sotries and the variety here runs the gamut from historic fantasy, cultural fantasy, horror, whimsical, romantic, adventure fantasy, and epic. I loved each story and struggle to select just one as my favorite.The best feature about this book is the characterization of the heroines. Afterall, this is why MZB compiled the collection. I love that she found the virtues we all admire in our heroes in these characters. They are courageous, humble, witty, resourceful, vulnerable, conflicted, and admirable each in their own right.I would love to find this volume in hardcover, alas it has not been published that way. Its a shame too, I could keep this book proudly on display."
1,JUNK,"This is a piece of junk but a necessary one since the GoGear Travel speak doesn't attach to anything, so you don't get handsfree operation without this holder. The other reviewers at least got double sided tape. I received single sided tape and had to glue the one side. The phone holder does not actually connect firmly with the backing. The TAB A/ Slot B thing doesn't work. I believe this was the design of an engineer afraid of commitments. You probably do need it or something like it but really gang, I would have paid twice the money for a better design."
4,Great smell,"I love this perfume an d have bought it from a small perfume shop before, so when I bought it from Amazon it smelt completely different. I actually bought the EDP not the EDT since the perfume lasts longer than the toilette. And in response to the lady that said that the pink bottle smells different from the black since one is more fruity and one is newer, that is not completely true. The black bottle is the eau de toilette, which means that it is more alcohol based as compared to the pink bottle in the black box that is an eau de perfume and is more oil based and will last longer."
4,For sophisticated woman,"Well, apparently, I'm not sophisticated enough for this perfume, because it smells amazing on my mom and rather boring on me. So, I bought her a gift set with the eau de toilette and she loved it.To me (and I have no idea what notes are in it) it's a very sharp scent. It has a hint of rose or rose pepper that gives it a quite feminine air, yet with no sweetness. I think it is better for summer time, because it's rather ""cold"" and fresh. Definitely a very sophisticated perfume."
4,The sample smells different than the full sized bottle,"I got a sample of this from Sephora and fell in love. A year later, I bought the full sized bottle and it smells different. It's not as flowery and vanilla as the sample. I'm aware of the pink bottle and the black bottle and I'm sure they were both the same scent. I got the bottle off Ebay, so I'm suspecting that it was either old, or a fake. Ah well.There is a cheaper perfume that smells JUST like this. I forgot the name, but Sarah Jessica Parker is on the ad. I think it's called ""Beautiful"" or something."
5,Narciso Rodriguez for Her - Smells like heaven,I absolutely love this perfume! It's so feminine and the deeper notes of the fragrance are so subtle and stay for so long. I feel sexy when I put it on!
3,"Entertaining, Informative, Dissapointing","""The Revolution"" is very entertaining, and provides in depth insight of ""selected"" perspectives of the revolution. The re-telling of Benedict Arnold's heroism and treachery, and Gates ineptitude, is solid. However, this series completely omits the Battle of Kings Mountain, which is a severe disservice to this important battle. Kings Mountain was the major win of patriots over loyalists, the first significant victory after Gates humiliation at Camden. To not even mention this battle shows the patchwork nature of the documentary, and it's clearly aimed more at entertainment than at providing a complete picture of the revolution."
3,Erotic? Yes and No,"This unique deck contains a variety of erotic images, from the lovely (the statuesque 'Empress' with a soldier groveling at her feet), the interesting (the 'Magician,' where a smiling mechanically-inclined woman is attaching a phallus to her own custom giant sex machine), to the humorous ('Strength'-a woman holding onto a gargantuan erection for dear life; '2 of Earth'-a sexy blonde trying to seduce a comically startled, nerdy man). However, the preponderance of cards depicting decidedly un-erotic or downright disturbing imagery (creepy, leering men menacing helpless women in what appear to be rape scenes waiting to happen) bring an energy that may ultimately leave you cold. A novel collection item, to be sure, but not a deck that I would actually use for divination purposes."
1,hair,it saids it does not have geltin but it does have geltin in it so really miss leading when you get it
5,excellent,"The product is very good I recommend it. Very good for the nails and the hair, already I have used it in other ocaciones and really it gives very good results"
2,"Not really 18x18""","The pillows, although appeared nice, were sent back because they measured out to be 16x16"" and not 18x18"" as described."
4,????,"the size for these stuffers is misleading these pillows didnt even fill a corner of my shams, i couldnt return hell shipping cost more than the pillows and you have to pay return shipping. so use the pillows as couch throwback pillows thats why i gave it 4 stars it serves real good for the couch but for the shams on my bed not so."
4,SQUARE SHAM STUFFER PILLOW,I bought these because I got tired of picking up feathers from the couch pillows shedding. These work fine so far.
4,Great Text For Art students,"Combining great illustrations along with good information, this text truly delivers what many are lacking in. From print to web design, this book explores many facets of Design."
1,Don't be fooled!!!,"The music is great. But all you are getting is music and one still photo per track. So why bother going DVD? I can't play it in my car or on my computer. Maybe some of you can if you have DVD drives hooked up everywhere. Lucky you if you do. But even so, there's nothing to look at. So buy the CD.I rate the music 5 star.I rate the DVD execution minus 1 star."
1,... Many songs missing here. Greatest hits?? ... Give me a break !,"This is no greatest hits. Where are their best songs? ""I will remember"", ""The killing words"", ""Della Brown"", ""The thin line"", ""Out of mind"" . The unplugged sessions album, that's the one I am dying to get... whoever has the rights to that music: MTV or EMI ...please release it !!"
1,very disapointing,I purchased this unit for my husband to improve his safety. However he spent more time fooling with the connection which barely attached to the phone with a very flimsy clip and the rest of the time he spent repeating himself due to the poor speaker and reception. I am returning it!
5,Insightful reading,"Katrina Mayer's THE MUSTARD SEED WAY lifts you up when you feel low. I liked the last chapter where NOWHERE is turned into NOW HERE. No fretting about yesterday's guilt, no worry about tomorrows heavy responsibilities. - Live the moment. - Live NOW-HERE. Member of Holy Cross Lutheran Church,Long Island, NY"
3,"Valuable information, poorly presented.","Could have been an excellent book. If one is to review a book, content must be taken into account, but also presentation, for books are instruments of diffusion and communication of ideas. The ideas in this book are original, bright and useful, and there is no doubt that Mr. Gottemoeller is an expert in this trade. But he (or his editors) should have invested more time in the graphic display of these ideas."
3,Check Software Availability Before you buy,"Excellent PC, but poor application availability/compatibility.Eventhough HandHeld PC 2000 (H/PC),PocketPC uses the same core OS (Windows CE) you cannot run application written for PocketPC in H/PC (some managed to run with bit of hacking).I love the screen size, it's ideal for reading tech-docs and e-books. But Ironically there is no MS Reader or free pdf reader. The pdf reader for H/PC by Ansyr cost around USD80 and not as good as the free one from adobe for PocketPC.By the way this product is discontinued by HP. So my recommendation is goto user forums and check and see the problems discussed before you buy."
2,Not HP quality,"I have been using an HP handheld computer for over 10 years and I really liked my rugged little machine that I could slip in a pocket,use versions of bigger programs on,type instead of pecking with a stylus and connect to the Internet.So I came prepared to love the 720.I am afraid I have been disappointed.2 weeks after I received my computer, two keys fell out of the keyboard and just after a year the pin that holds the screen to the keyboard broke.I was used to a machine that tanks have run over and survived and didn't expect it to fall apart with normal use.I was used to figuring out how programs worked and plugging them in and going but Active Synch required a call to HP and I never could get the Internet connection to work,and this is from someone who has been using an HP variant for years.But mainly I have been very disappointed in the quality of the hardware."
2,It was great! ... 8 years ago,"I bought this for typing my notes in class 8 years ago. Yeah, it was great then, but I can't believe they're still selling it and for almost the same amount that I paid for it years ago. Wtf? Buy a netbook."
3,Not what I was expecting,"Item had an old operating system on it. It didn't come with the touch pen. I couldn't get it hooked to the internet wirelessly. Actually, I don't even know if it is even capable of it. Internet instruction were a bit confusing."
4,"One of Hauer's Better Roles In A Chilling ""What If"" Movie...","This is a very chilling and vivid tale of the world in an alternate historical path; What if Hitler had been the victorious hero and lived to see his vision of the Third Reich come to fruition for the rest of Europe and possibly the world ! With this in mind, Fatherland is a true suspense thriller with awesome actors and a believable 60's set design and nostalgic, yet somewhat futuristic wardrobe ( although the film's events take place in an alternate past). Rutger Hauer is one of today's most underappreciated actors and Miranda Richardson is very convincing as an American journalist. The most disturbing role of all is played by Jean Marsh as an extremely bitter Nazi actress; Listen to a very chiling line about the ""resettling"" of the Jews. This one particular line is very shocking and haunting ! It serves as the underlying basis for the plot in this film."
4,cute toy,"I bought this for my three year old daughter. She does play with this toy at times. I gave it to her to see how she would react. I got her the big play ground one also. I think she will like the puppies and house after I give her the play ground one to go with it. I got them for her for Christmas hope she likes the big one. Over all she plays with the doggies most of all out of this set. The have little magnets on the bottom so she will stick them on her bed and play all over her bed with them. She does have some fun with this toy. The door comes off easy I have already replaced it twice, my husband also replaced it once."
4,Quarter Map,"Nice quarter map for quarter collection and educational purposes for kids. It's bigger than expected, but it folds in half. Quarters don't fall out of their designated slots."
3,Coin book,I bought this book for my nephew. It is a beautiful way to display the quarters. I had purchased one at Walmart (5.25) and thought the quality was much better than this one. This book is cardboard and the corners were already wearing in two days. I was very disappointed knowing I spent 20.00. I would not recommend this state book for durability. Sorry - Walmart doesn't carry the state quarter book anymore. Live and learn.
4,information you need,I read this book doing research as a criminal defense lawyer. I found it fascinating and very helpful. thanks to editors.
5,Pink Magnolia Club,"My FIRST response to the Pink Magnolia Club...Geralyn, PLEASE,PLEASE write a sequel. Holly, Maggie and Grace have become like dear friends to me. I laughed and cried over and over again as I read the book. A co-worker gave me an advance copy to read. It is wonderful. I have read ALL your books and this one is BEST OF ALL!I think you did a wonderful job of sharing the Making Memories Breast Cancer Foundation story while winding a tale so very close to the heart of every women in America.I plan to tell ALL my friends about the Pink Magnolia Club ...What an awesome thing to do with your wedding gown. Give it to Making Memories so it can be sold to grant last wishes for terminal breast cancer patients. I don't have a dress myself to donate, but I am for sure going to find out more about the ""Diamonds for Dreams"" program. Maybe I can help there since I don't have a dress.Thank you for writing this terrific book. PLEASE will you consider a sequel?Sincerely,Sue High"
2,This book was a snore,I've heard Mr. Ziglar speak in person and he was very humerous and captivating. Wish I could say the same of his Autobiography. He detailed his youth and his family to the boring extreme. He spoke very little about the type of work he does now - only about all the job changes he went through. Maybe I expected too much; but after hearing this man in person I expected much more.
5,Life Saver to say the least,"Oh my God! What can I say about this book. Kay's first book is a good introduction to the Food Addiction subject but From the First Bite is much more than a complement. Is a must have if you related to Food Addiction. Everytime I read it, and I read it all the time like a survival of life kind of book, I feel renewed and strong enough to continue with my new way of eating and of life. Everyday I feel recovered from a disease that had devastated me. I am so thankful that a book like this one came to my attention. I am even thankful with Amazon for making it easy for me to have it!!! Thanks Kay Sheppard reading your words is getting hugs, love and approval on a regular basis."
2,"Falls short, too much censoring","This is a wonderful collection for the Chuck Jones/Mel Blanc collector, HOWEVER, it is censored and not nearly as good as the DVD version. It has a collection of cartoons that time forgot and is definately geared towards those who can remember the end of WW2 from a ""been there"" stand point, rather than a history book view.Get it, but be wary. The complete uncensord DVD is much better!"
3,half listenable / half perishable,"As far as ""BEST OF"" collections go, this is not one of my favourites. There are too many other HATS songs that could have made this CD a true gem (just listen to ""POP"" and you'll know what I mean). Whenever I listen to this CD, I have to skip over half of the tracks. But there are some definite winners here: Safety Dance, Living in China, I Got the Message, Pop Goes the World, On Tuesday, and a great remix of Freeway. All in all, if you're just getting into HATS and looking for a fun/groovy/pop CD, then it's probably a good starting point."
1,did not fit,"This did not work with my mamiyaOp/Tech Super Pro Strap ""B"" fits Mamiya RB/RZ, Pentax 6x7/645, Rollei - Black"
5,For Mamiya 645,I bought a used Mamiya 645 with a waistlevel finder and wanted a strap to carry and use as support when shooting. The lugs on the strap matched the fittings on the side of the camera and are very secure. I adjusted the strap length to position the camera and it works perfectly. Just what I wanted.
4,This strap will fit Mamiya M645 J,This strap does fit the Mamiya M645 J Camera. It was a struggle to get it on and I wonder if it will ever come off again but it fits and seems like a decent camera strap.
2,Cheaply made and won't last the season.,"I had this book sent to my grandson for Halloween, seeing that he loves the ""There was an old lady who swallowed a spider"" book. This book is hard to get a rhythm to reading it, and worst of all, it is very cheaply made. It came in a cardboard jacket that bent, hence the paperback book inside was also bent. Before lunch was over, the book was wearing out. More like a comic book than a bookshelf book.Not a good value for the price :-<"
4,Book review,THIS BOOK IS REALLY CUTE AND ALWAYS GETS A GOOD LAUGH OUT OF MY DAUGHTER AS WE READ IT TOGETHER. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT IS VERY INTERACTIVE AND IMAGINATIVE.
1,Don't even rent,Ok first off I am a big fan of the first one. It obviously wasn't the biggest budget or best acting I've ever seen. That was the point though. The second one on the other hand I wouldn't recommend watching for free. It barely has any gore the acting is some of the worst I've ever seen and I usually don't mind it. There is nothing good about this movie at all. Watch the first one.
3,"Worth the money, but a boring novel.","I recieved this book as a birthday present. It's not a gift I regret recieving or reading, but I wouldn't spend that much money to buy it.PROS:-The pictures are gorgeous, all of my favorite moments are included-The sidebar conversations with characters are pretty funny-Easy navigation, side articles on interesting aspects of productionCONS:-If this book had none of the above, it would be a really boring novel-Very few comments about anything beyond the first visualization and storyboard sessions.-Very few side stories, or funny anecdotes after the third chapterIf you want to read a good movie book, read Lord of the Rings: Making of a Movie Trilogy... They have great stories from the directors, designers, and even lawyers. Very entertaining, well worth the time."
3,Informative Regarding John Hancock,"This book is an informative read regarding the life of John Hancock. The book was well written, but with one major downfall. The author seems to have an irrational hatred of Samuel Adams. In every instance where Sam Adams is mentioned, the author can't seem to refrain from making some negative innuendo. I would have found the book much more enjoyable other Founding Fathers weren't constantly being degraded."
4,Island Within,"Vivid descriptions of lush deepwoods, forests, basins and lakes. The lengthy depiction gives a sense of natural balance and depth to hunting and the author's own conscience about it. It is deceptive though and what other would leave pristine, he would use!"
4,Well worth the effort,"I found the exposition in parts of this book quite poor. The prose is often pretty cryptic, there were some typographical errors that led me down detours while I tried to work through the details, so it took a lot of work (for me at least) to figure out some of the steps. The fact that a lot of the examples are of ""toy"" problems doesn't help see how the framework developed could be used for anything.This is one of those books that should say ""Some assembly required"" on the cover.I still think this is an important book, and that it deserves considerably more influence in academic philosophy, especially in the literature on causal process theories (developments of the work of Reichenbach and Salmon) and relations between theories in philosophy of science.This isn't easy, and it's not obvious what it's useful for, but it's still very good. I'm not sure what the theoretical computer scientists make of it."
2,Dreary filmmaking,"Julian Bream is undoubtedly one of the very greatest guitarists of the 20th century and almost certainly the greatest musician to play the guitar. But this film is a dreary, nearly unwatchable exercise. Bream is not at his best doing commentary, which manages to be at the same time both pompous and shallow. He is also hard to watch in close-up because of the extreme effort involved in his way of playing. But the long, tiresome and pointless excursions in the Spanish scenery are even worse. And all too often, commentary of some sort is uttered above a musical performance.The DVD ends with a performance of the Concierto de Aranjuez of Joaquin Rodrigo that merely demonstrates that Bream is NOT an outstanding concerto performer.Unfortunate that such a great artist as Julian Bream should be remembered by this badly-done film."
5,A moving experience,"I bought this DVD for my father as a Christmass gift, and we never would have expected such a lot of beauty an artistry in one package. Not only you will enjoy one of the very best guitar player of all time, but also an enormous cinema work from the director and producers, blending beautiful and meaningful footage of Spain with the pieces of music. To be watched and rewatched for ever..."
3,Guitarra!,"While the music and settings are beautiful, this video is more easily digestable as background music than the sit down and watch variety. The guitars are amazingly crafted and the time period settings are stunning...but, overall, this video is a little too dry ."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this for my son from QVC for Christmas. Two weeks later I shipped it back. It was great as long as you had the volume on high but when he wanted to listen to it on a low volume at night, there was alot of static even when you played a CD. It sounded like it was on a bad radio station although we were listening to CDs and cassettes. I ordered him the Sony CFD-F10 as a replacement and we are so happy with it. All we have ever owned is Sony so I should have known better."
3,Worth getting if you are really into Men At Work,"I don't like this album as much as Business As Usual, but I think I like it better than Cargo. I ran into this album on the discount rack in '93 and had already been listening to the previous two albums for many years, so I decided to give it a whirl. This is definitely not ""Business As Usual 2"". The songs have a sound a little different from the previous two albums, and I like it. ""Stay At Home"" is hilarious and could be my biography, and ""Still Life"" is incredibly powerful. Too bad the radio didn't give this album any air play. I'm glad I found this on CD!"
3,It's ok,"Our black lab has gone through at least 5 of these. All have failed on the cable below the end that attaches to his choke collar. They last us about 4 months. We continue to buy them because when they break we need to pick something up quickly and they're the heaviest thing that our local pet store carries. I think if your dog is fairly calm you'll do fine with this. If he's strong and prone to ""testing"" the cable, he'll eventually snap it. I just found that they make a 250lb cable, and am going to try that one."
2,Awkward clips,"This is a very sturdy product however it takes too hands and conscious coordination to attach it to the dog collar because the clips open ""backwards"". This design does not make sense."
2,Dim...,"I ordered this product to try and at least make some parts of our business environmentally friendly, but when we put this bulb in to use it didn't nearly produce the same amount of light as a regular 100 watt flood light. Two weeks later I purchased the old fashioned flood lights."
3,BIG Bulb,"This bulb is BIG. The screw is normal, but it fans out to 9 inches, so it won't fit in a lot of indoor spotlight fixtures. Other than that, it's your standard fluorescent, with the usual advantages: it won't overheat, doesn't need much electricity, and lasts a long time."
2,will not fit all sockets,"This Flood bulb did not fit my outdoor lights because the sockets were recessed to much. Be sure the width of the bulb base will fit into the socket housing. The housing of the socket will vary, irregardless whether indoor or outdoor. I checked Costco and to try theirs, but I had the same problem.The cost at Costco was $4.27 total for a 4-Pack CLF Flood bulbs (after the automatic Edison energy saving rebate at checkout). Regular CLF 75 watt equivalent were $1.00 at ACE hardware for 4-Pack. Those will be slighly taller.Both CLF types are cold to the touch even after hours of operation, which is cool."
3,Aleister Crowley,"This is a good work of Aleister Crowley. Some of the essays and elements within have been reprinted in other volumes, but this one is still a good choice. I would recomend it especially for any followers of Crowley or the Golden Dawn; but it is still a good read for anyone just interested in theory."
4,Simple and pleasing animals,"I like this book. When I first saw it, I flipped through it and saw some figures that used some rather interesting techniques. That is why I originally bought it.Upon further examination, I found myself really appreciating the look of the models taught within. Some are really cute.The diagrams are quite clear and nicely colored. The models are at the beginner's end of the complexity spectrum, but are still very nice. The small price tag is another nice selling point. Too many of the good books are way to expensive for their contents but that is not the case with this book."
4,Pleasant Read,England 1800'sTHE MARRIAGE LESS is a light enjoyable read! This is the third book of the Effington family.
5,sIGHTS & SOUND OF NATURE,i USED THIS PACK OF VIDEOS DURING OUR CHURCH SERVICE FOR A BACKGROUND TO PROJECT THE WORDS OF OUR SONGS OVER TOP OF THE BACK GROUND VIDEO. THE NATURE SCENES ARE VERY INSPIRATIONAL
5,Finger-picking magic,"Speed, technique, mastery of the instrument are all there. But what is most compelling is the heart present within the lightning licks or slow blues slide. Chops for miles, few players are left at this level. Listen for the feel and compassion that a 30 year plus veteran still has hidden (maybe too well) in the tracks. That's where the tasty treat lies. After your amazement fades - look for the soul. It satisfies a lot longer than the chops and invites the replays."
5,One of the must have book to everyone who deals in international affairs.,"Henry Kissinger's diplomacy is one of the greatest book of the 20th centurie, but you need to be warned of one thing: it is a book which express a point of view, and it does very good, it is not linked in cientific discurs or anything that resembles ""neutrality"" in the ideas.So, before hailing this book as a bible of diplomacy and international affairs i STRONGLY suggest to read the Wilhem G. Grewe Epochs of international law to have a second throught about kissingers book.But, even with this impetous of trying to convince you that the truth is been spoken, this is one of the must have book for everyone, especially those who deals in the international area.And very usefull explanation about the north american diplomatic psique..."
4,International Affairs,"Kissinger writes of the history of international politics from the Peace of Westphallia until the modern era with obvious familiarity and ease. The chapters can be read individually or as a continuing history. This book proved worthwhile not only by giving me greater insight into politics among nations, but also some very well appreciated background on subject matter covered in my Modern Europe 306 history course. The philosophies of Idealism and Realism shine through, and Kissenger always a realist, presents his case well. One aspect missing from this otherwise nearly complete volume is a more telling account of his involvment in the context of the greater scheme of things: Arms talks, Indonesia and Chile to name a few. Taken as a whole I recomend this to any student of history, international affairs, and especially to the individual who would like a greater understanding of how things international work."
3,A Quiet Evening's Read,"A quick book for a quiet evening. Great for these winter nights snuggled close to a warm fire. Romance with a touch of humor and surprise. This is not normally the type of book I read, but once into it the story offers an unexpected change from the routine romance. Set in 19th Century England, it offers an escape from the day to day grime. Yes, this is definitely a book for a serene candle light glowing evening. Enjoy!"
5,A Skillfully Told and Riveting Tale,"This is an all around great book for young adults. This book has mystery, suspense, and a bit of melodrama. Just the right mix to keep young adult readers transfixed. You keep on turning pages and the book pratically reads itself. Another well written book from a good author."
5,So pleased with merchandise and service,Your service was fantastic. We received the item we ordered in just a few days and the merchandise was of excellent quality. This was an A+ shopping experience. Thank you!
1,The soundtrax of my life Feliciano,"What a dreadful album. After 10 to 23, this album does not deserve air time."
5,Thank You,Thank you for your prompt and carefully attention to our order. The requested item was received ahead of schedule and was in excellent attention. Again thank you very much.
4,one of the best,"A wonderful novel by Avi. It has the comedy, horror and drama of all Avi's books roled into one. Not only kids but teens and adults would love this book. Everyone has one person in the book that they can relate to. Weather it be Conrad, Nancy or even the parents. This is definitly one of the better books by Avi."
5,Fine bargain on a great book,"great book, have bought many of this one to give away. Have read many asto books but Sakoin's are the best. They are concise, insightful, and to the point."
3,OK for the price,"I bought this with the ""Grizzly G0463 Mill/Drill"" as it was a recommended accessory. Only problem is the T nuts do now fit the t-slots on this mill. However that is what a mill is good for. My first project was to mill down the t-nuts to fit the slots. Kind of annoying but still a good value. Yes the holder is kinda thin and cheaply made, but look at the price."
1,Princess of Mars,"Edgar Rice Burroughs' literary work by this title was cutting edge for the time. An unknown world, space travel, a hero, a beautiful Martian princess, action and creatures no one had ever imagined was all a teenager could desire in reading. This movie is the exact antihesis of the book. It is simply terrible. If I could have rated it ""0"" stars, I would have! The terrible acting and poor production quality created a ""pulp"" movie."
3,"Avatar,This is The GEEKS VERSION of Youse !","Starring:Antonio Sabato Jr.,Traci Lords and Matt Lasky.Written and Directed by: Mark Atkins"" First moments reminded me of how I felt when watching `Star Wars' for first time !""We liked this movie takes you away from everyday issues and into a wild ride with Creatures,Monsters, Traci Lords(For the male geeks) and Antonio Sabato Jr.(For female fans of reality shows).Great costumes and make-ups thanks to Tom Devlin and Gregory Paul Smith.You know if you squint Mark Atkins kind of resembles James Cameron,LOL !The evil is present in an almost `Jabba The Hut' and a guy right out of the `Indiana Jones' school of villians .Really good piece of adventure and escapist fun brought to film !"
1,Excruciating,"I've never seen fifteen minutes of corny dialogue and posturing stretched out so thriftily into a ninety minute movie. I've seen better acting in grammar school plays featuring young children wearing construction paper hats and old bedsheets.Unfortunately Creature Features and Elvira's Movie Macabre are off the air now, but this film holds its head up high in comparison to Plan 9 from Outer Space or Kazaam, so could easily spark a revival."
1,different,This movie was a low budget movie and it showed. I would have been better off not seeing it.
1,Princess of Mars NOT,"Wow! This was one of the single most biggest disappointment EVER! Not even close to the book in my personal opinion. John Carter NOT SOUTHERN, Princess NOT RED SKINNED AND DARK HAIRED WIT AN ATTITUDE, ALIENS NOT 9 FT WITH 4 ARMS AND GREEN! So much wrong with this film I can't even mention it all. Bad acting, bad effects, bad editing, and REALLY BAD writing. Do yourself a favor and don't watch it if you want to remain a fan of John Carter!"
2,We have the princess!,"I waited about 40 years for this to become a movie and I enjoyed it...ok, I expected a lot of things that didn't happen...no Woola, not the the best swordsmanship of two worlds, the princess was blonde instead of a dark haired(ok, perhaps they have discoverd hair dye on Barsoom), etc....but it was nice to see some takeback of things that belonged to Barsoom that Star Wars borrowed like floating airships and princess attire...the ""my princess"" scenes meant a lot to me....Traci Lords was of course truely not of this earth and on Barsoom she could be 40 or 400 and still look the same...with guns and chains Antonio Sabato put up some nice action scenes...I will be watching it again...I do suggest that you rent before you buy...."
1,Princess of Mars,"This was probably one of the cheesiest movies I have seen. I have read the John Carter series by ERB and this is so far from the actual story it's laughable, however with that being said, if you want to see a movie that is full of cliches and bad acting this might be for you. I gave it one star only because I couldn't go lower on the scale."
4,The power of Steinman Times Two!,"It wasn't until I started listening to this CD that I realized that Jim Steinman had written for Bonnie Tyler too. I have always loved both of these singers, I just never pictured them together, but this CD really brings out the similarities in their styles. While they aren't doing duets really, it truely is a great CD to have and has become the one most often in my car CD player now."
5,"Fantastic seller, fantastic album",Citriniti along with Fabrizio Leo are the most underrated fantastic group of musicians I've ever stumbled upon (courtesy Pandora and my undying love for unique and remarkable bass lines/players)Seller was quick and item was new as claimed. Had a yellow post-it with a handwritten thank you on it. I couldn't ask for more.
1,No disclosure,"Caveat emptor. There is no indication on Amazon that these are rerecorded versions, not the original versions! iTunes discloses this."
2,Baaaaaaaaaah,"I did not like reading this book. First of all it's supposed to be about Emma, the book talks about war in Sudan and things that go waaaaay back like Gordon and anti-slavery, word to author: this isn't supposed to be a history book I'm assuming. I understand that ""Emma's War"" meant the war between Riek and Garang but it was supposed to be a biography of Emma, not of the history of Sudan or what some guy in the government had to say about this war. Second, she jumps back and forth from Emma to what's happening in Sudan to her own experiences, it's hard to understand when there are all these names that Emma is associated with, then add the people she met and people who are fighting in Sudan, those against it and you don't know who is who. Also I found that this booke xplained very little about the conflict in Sudan, I just got the gist of it that it's between north and south. That was it. I might as well mention this was required reading for school"
3,Neils masters not replicated,"This Karaoke disk does not capture Neils greatest hits in their original context, but it does have a Karaoke feel to it."
3,"My daughter loves it, but she leaks a bit","Like most of the other reviews the paint on her lips came off during the first feeding. And it wasn't until today, about 2 weeks later, that the doll recognized the spoon and made the feeding movements and sounds she is supposed to when you feed her. The food comes out of her bottom just fine but also tends to come out of her arms which tells me that she is not sealed too well and its kind of messy. I have a feeling my daughter will tire of the the chore of feeding and cleaning her and just play with her like all of her other ""plain"" dolls soon."
1,What a messy baby,"These bad reviews are so funny, because they are all so true! I had a doll like this when I was young and when I saw this doll I thought it would be so much fun. I bought a ton of extra food thinking ""I know it's messy, but that's what makes it fun!"" Well, now I rarely let my daughter feed her because she is a very messy eater! Like the other reviews my doll has problems too.-In the loud store she sounded fine, but at home her gears and such were really loud and weird.-Lip color wore off on the first day of use.-Not enough hair on her head.-Hard to move her legs around to get a good fit for the diaper.-Not sure what happened but my doll recently suffered a shattered cheek bone and is now deformed.I was really excited to get this doll then quickly realized, surely I could have got something better for $50. I guess it's not all bad, it made me laugh thinking about that messy doll!"
3,Too much work for a toy!,"My 3 year old asked for nothing else but this doll for Christmas and thanks to Santa she got it. However, Mommy just got more work and mess to clean up. She doesn't actually ""eat."" It's more like shoving a spoonful of muck into her mouth and then washing it down with water. And she ALWAYS says she's ""hungry"" which prompts little one to want to feed her... AGAIN! Now mommy has to go buy more diapers... (I thought I was done with all that!)Make sure you wash her thoroughly inside the mouth and let water run through her over & over again until you know she is clean. Luckily her clothes are machine washable.And finally... why does have such freakishly HUGE eyes?! Her eyes are not proportionate to her head and the rest of her facial features. She's just freaky to look at... and then she starts talking to you... YIKES!"
4,Cute doll,All of the girls in the family love this doll. they range in ages from 8 to 11. the only complaint i have is the mess. of course you have a food and diaper bill but its not that bad. the girls really like the doll
1,Thankful Mom for reviews,"Hasbro Baby Alive Doll, CaucasianThanks to all the moms out there who took the time to write these reviews. I have been contemplating purchasing the Baby Alive doll for my daughter who just turned 4. I was thinking it would be the perfect Christmas gift this year for her being she is into these types of things now and hey if the baby really eats and goes potty how cool is that! After reading the reviews I think I am going to try and talk her into asking Santa for something else this year!!"
1,Make sure it works!!,"I was so excited to get this toy for my 3 1/2 year old. It was what she kept asking Santa for and I used to have the original so I thought it would be so much fun. When we FINALLY got it untied and out of the box, mixed the food and began feeding her we quickly realized that despite saying she was hungry she wouldn't move her mouth to eat the food or drink the bottle. Had I not seen our neighbor's doll working properly I wouldn't have known for sure that something was wrong, after all, we put knew batteries in and everything. My daughter was heartbroken, the doll talked but only said the same thing over and over- she was hungry and then she would not even eat the food. We were very disappointed.I also noticed that my neighbors doll who had been working properly since Christmas already had the lip paint worn off after not even 2 days of use. I thought that wasn't very good as well. Now I'm scared to return this one for a new one. Still not sure if I will."
4,fun novelty baby doll,"This is a fun baby doll with many options; no functions, speech/expression, drink/wet, eat/mess, all functions at once. Our girls have played with their dolls in all capacities & love them. If you are buying this for a little girl, be advised that the doll is large & heavy."
4,Teach me on how to quit on diapers,"My 2 years old likes this toy. It is fun to watch her interact with the doll, but she does get bored with her pretty quickly and the constant talking. She try to feed her and gives water, however I believe for a 2 years old it's not the right toy, yet. We bought this toy hoping that it could help us to teach our baby on how to quit on the diapers. So we have read on books. It didn't work for us but we didn't push as strong as we recommended to do though."
1,Horrible waste of money,"I bought this doll for my 3 year olds Birthday, By the end of the day the dolls lips had rubed off completely. By the end of the week the Doll had completely stoped working all together. What a waste of money, This is by far the worst Toy I have ever seen, to bad I couldn't rate this toy with negative stars."
3,BABY ALIVE REVIEW,"MY DAUGHTER LOVES THE BABY ALIVE DOLL BUT SHE IS A LOT OF TROUBLE WHEN IT COMES TO FEEDING HER AND CHANGING HER, THE DIAPERS THAT COME WITH HER LEAK, THEY ARE NOT BIG ENOUGH, EITHER DON'T FEED HER A WHOLE PACKET OF FOOD OR USE A REGULAR NEWBORN DIAPER AND ALSO WATCH OUT, THE FOOD WILL STAIN STUFF AND ALSO HER FACE GOT DIRTY AND WE ARE HAVING A TIME GETTING IT CLEANED, SHE STAINS TOO SO WATCH OUT, THIS DOLL IS A LOT OF TROUBLE TO A MOTHER, MAYBE NOT TO A KID WHO LOVES FEEDING AND CHANGING BUT SHE IS A MESSY DOLL!"
2,Dizzy Gillespie/Cannonball Adderley DVD,Overall the material is great. A real deficiecy though is the Adderley section. This has the material taken from Ralph Gleason's Jazz Casual. The problem though is the sound is off from the video by about a half second. This is very annoying to watch and destroys the DVD's quality. On the remainder of the DVD the sound lines up nicely with the video.
3,Look for a better book,"For some reason this book has famous actors recommending it, but there are better books on westerns. The descriptions are too short and they do not include directors. The author has a rating system, but it is subjective, of course. There are pictures, but their quality is not that good."
1,"Poorly Done. Nevertheless, Miracles do happen...","Of course this movie is not a blockbuster and maybe that is a point of significant appeal. I however found the film laughable not only in its storyline but also in the acting within the movie. My desire is not to tear this piece to pieces, and while I am not of the faith of the people in the film or most probably the people who buy the film as well, the movie is sub-par. A few examples include, 1) Staircases exploding from the side of the burning house, 2) The pastor's denial that his rescuer in the fire was another firefighter who said, and I quote ""Follow me and walk in my path."" There are many examples of items similar to the aforementioned. The movie by any standard is mediocre. Enough said."
3,immigration handbook,"how to be legal residence on the u s a ,how to obtain a green card ,ways to get citenship"
1,Unusable,"I purchased this item recently and found it extremely difficult to use. I am sending it back.The instructions are abismal and they even say that you need to ""...use a piece of discarded fletching..."" to hold the new fletching in place. What?The design is simply bad. I was unable to get the jig to hold the fletching in the correct position. So, if the jig will not hold the fletching in the correct position (flush against the shaft), then it just doesn't work.I would not recommend this item."
5,Works fast & easy to clean,Very easy to clean. Freezes fast. I have only used it for frozen drinks so far. My only complaint would be that each batch is not that big but this works well if you want to make different flavors.
3,Did what it needed,Used it to seal our thank you notes. Template wasn't on the website - I guess they updated it so it doesn't fit snuggly with the seals.
5,Exploring the World of the Jew,"This is an astounding book. Not only does it cover the origins and early history of the Jews, but the reader will be amazed at their contributions to art, medicine, music, religion, philosophy, and scientific discoveries of the world through eons of time. Although they have suffered as no other people have suffered, they have not and never will be destroyed since they are God's special people."
5,Excellent!,"What a well constructed plot! The characters seem to be living persons! I have never read anything like this. Whereas plot and setting remind you of the traditional English mystery, the animals are a brilliant new idea. Even more ingenious is the idea that animals can understand human beings but not vice versa. This gives the plot a lot of dramatic irony. This was my first Mrs. Murphy novel and I am going to read them all!"
2,Badly written,"While reading this book I kept thinking that I could write the same thing in 1/3 the space, with sentences 1/2 the length, and twice the clarity. As a reader of lots of books on the same general subject I found this one less than useful and hardly worth the time. It's a shame that Flew's very baroque writing greatly decreases the value of what he has to say. By the way, I am an atheist, so my views are not biased against this book."
1,Will not print Cd's,"I had two R300's and now this R340. All of them are great photo printers but none would print more than 2 or 3 cd's before crapping out. The feed tray will not align or the machine can't tell it is aligned and you get an endless error message that the cd tray is not loaded properly.While I am at it I want to vent about the way Epson support deals with this problem. They keep you on the phone for 45 minutes going trough very basic driver checks and reloading the printer software and then tell you you have to go to the next level of support to waste more time. They know this tray thing is mechanical but they won't address the issue headon, hoping you will go away. They should put this problem in the tech's script and not waste everyone's time with meaningless software run-arounds.Bob KerryTucson"
2,Not Worth It,"James Patterson has been writing thriller novels since the 1970s, but didn't become a big success until 1990, when he wrote a novel entitled ALONG CAME A SPIDER featuring a character named Alex Cross. Now he's the biggest thriller writer in existence. I like Patterson's stories, but I don't think his pre-1990 novels are worth reading.THE MIDNIGHT CLUB is an example of why. It comes across as a pretty mediocre novel, especially if you've read a lot of thriller fiction. The characters are quite flat, and the plot is pretty predictable and filled with silly cliches. The romance, in particular, is not the least bit believable. Unlike Patterson's later novels, this book is also pretty slow paced and overwritten in sections. I found it a chore to read.I think THE MIDNIGHT CLUB is for Patterson completists only. If you're new to his work, my advice is to try KISS THE GIRLS, 1ST TO DIE, THE QUICKIE, or JUDGE & JURY. Those novels are far more entertaining than what I found here."
3,Boilerplate thriller,"The über-bad guy who's invincible until the end. The cop bent on revenge. The rogue cop. The secret criminal society a la The Godfather on steroids. Bits and pieces of every thriller we've read are here on display. The bits and pieces fit adequately well, and the plot (the New York Cop and the Intrepid Reporter take down criminal mastermind with the help of the Feds) moves along. It's a decent airport read, but no more than that."
4,I Liked it,"This was my first James Patterson read. I will definiteoy read more of his. I thought the wheelchaired principal was a little contrived but . . . . . . . What the heck, it was still a fun book to read and fast reading as well."
2,I thought Patterson would be better than this!,"The only other novel by James Patterson I have read is ""Kiss the Girls,"" which I found SO much more enjoyable than this novel. The greatest flaws were the characters, and the climax (if you want to call it that). The characters were so 2 dimensional, with no real emotion, just basic stuff like ""he was angry, she was sad."" And the love story... need I say how simple and lame that was. The antagonism the 2 felt for each other lasted all of 2 pages before turning to true love. Please! Don't buy this book unless you're a die hard Patterson fan and worship anything he writes."
4,New York Detective Battles an International Crime Syndicate,"New York police detective John Stefanovitch is pursuing Alexandre St.Germaine, a leader of the Midnight Club, an elite, international group of criminals. When Stefanovitch gets too close, St. Germaine strikes back. He murders Stefanovitch's wife and barely misses killing Stefanovitch, but wounds him so badly that the detective is confined to a wheelchair. This does not stop the detective's relentless pursuit, even while fellow detective's are murdered. Finally, police and FBI undertake all-out war against the Midnight Club. The story is not up to Patterson's Alex Cross tales, but it is entertaining reading through the long battle between police and the Midnight Club."
3,A Slow Book,"This is my second non Alex Cross book that I've read and I'm slowly beginning to feel as if I shouldn't waste anymore time on a book that doesn't feature this character. With that said, I found this book VERY slow moving. The plot moved along very slowly but I kept reading it hoping that it would improve. I must say that I absolutely LOVED the ending which at least made me want to give it 3 stars but I'm sure that lots of people will be so bored that they won't stick around that long!"
3,Entertaining - if you have no other choices.,"Having read Along Came A Spider in one day and loving Kiss The Girls, I was somewhat disappointed in The Midnight Club. A rather weak plot and little character building - didn't help this novel. Hopefully Patterson will break out of this ""cookie-cutter"" style and return to his original mastery."
1,"Boring, contrived not up to his abilities","I really enjoy the Alex Cross stories so maybe I was more disappointed that readers who don't know Alex would be. I found this book slow, boring, and extremly predictable. The love story was a waste of paper, like anyone couldn't see that coming. I am looking forward to Alex's next story."
3,"Ok, but nothing new here","I gave this to my daughter because she was feeling apprehensive about starting her period (she is 11). She read the book in about half an hour. I asked her if the book had helped; she responded that it was stuff she already knew. I was a bit disappointed that it hadn't helped her deal with her fears in any way. I will save the book for my younger daughter but I wish that I hadn't wasted my money on this book. I didn't feel that it dealt with anything much. I was a bit shocked to see that it explained (in detail, with pictures) how to insert a tampon. I am not a prude but my girls are worried about wearing a pad....tampons were just too much information at this point in time. Maybe they will come back and look at it again in a few years....but the same info is given in tampon boxes anyway. Keep it basic, answer questions as they come up, and you won't need to waste your money on this book."
4,Great Hits Package with One exception,"This import Greatest Hits package is well worth the $ for two tracks that don't appear on any of the three Men studio albums: Shintaro and The Longest Night. The two remixes at the end of the disc aren't very good, and this collection is light on the 3rd album (no man with two hearts or snakes and ladders or maria) and it doesn't have the best Men song of all ""Down by the Sea."" A good collection overall, though the sound quality isn't as good as the american released ""Contraband"" album. Enjoy."
1,Low-fat Atkins,"This is an older book...and it shows. Basically it advocates a very low-carbohydrate, very low-fat, and very low-calorie diet. The worst thing is that the authors recommend this approach for the duration of weight loss. The meal plans allow for only one or two servings of vegetables a day and an amount of protein that will lead to muscle wasting. One can only shudder to think what kind of a sluggish metabolism will be developed by consuming just 650 calories a day.This is one of those books which should be quietly retired to an ""out of print"" status."
4,Madden NFL 07,"This is a great game. My son just loves it and plays it all the time. He has been wanting it for quite a while, and now that he has it, he is just thrilled. Thanks so much for having this item available to purchase at such a reasonable price."
2,A little too old fashioned for some tastes,"Having purchased previous Putamayo products such as the African, Mississippi blues, and French sets, I expected this to be in the same style. The previous sets blended the new with the old very well and had a much more contemporary feel to them. This set is old fashioned music and songs done by both traditional and modern artists. Even with the modern artists, the style is old fashioned and in many cases, dated. Some songs are better than others but overall there's no balance of where that older music lead to. I'm no expert on Italian music (I'm a bigger consumer of their food) but it seems there's better stuff out there than this."
1,"Careful, most phones not supported","The cable is correct for the W315, but the software is no-existant.The programmers have only worked on a limited few phones because they need loaner phones to add them in. Which means, they need someone to send their active Motorola phone connected to Verizon just to get the phone added to the software package for Verizon. I don't know about you, but I am not sending them my phone to play with. The other big problem is.... THe phone in the Name...Motorola W315... isn't even in the available phone list under ANY service. I then went to BitPim, the manufacturers of the software and downloaded their update to no avail. Then I found this disturbing page [...] I bought this cable to work now, not 5 years from now....if ever."
3,"Good quality, but it doesn't connect.","I used Windows XP until this year and used the snowball on that computer. It worked fine. I was lucky because I knew that it didn't work with vista. Unfortunately, you're taking a leap of faith if you're buying this with Windows 7. It doesn't work. I've tried what all those techy forums told me to do: I re installed drivers, ran XP mode on Windows 7 Pro, but I didn't get any results. The reason why I'm giving this product a three is because it's a damn fine mic when it's working, but it rarely works, so if you have a mac or a windows xp pc, then get it. If not, don't."
4,Will work with Adobe Audition 2.0 / Windows XP,"I just got this microphone and it does work on Adode Audition 2.0, (Windows XP), but like the above instructions say you need to install ASIO4ALL and use it as your sound driver in order to record from the microphone and it sounds great! I purchased this to use for my podcas[...] and I can't wait to use it for my next episode!"
4,Great mic for poscasting,"I found this mic to be reliable and it has great sound. The included stand is mostly useless, but that seems to be true for most USB mics. If you are a podcaster or if you're doing some basic home video work or watch me videos with Camtasia, this mic is a great solution."
5,Best Mic for the price,"I am a musician of sorts and I bought this microphone largely due to the good reputation that Blue has built up over recent years. I have to say I am very impressed.I mainly use the microphone to record myself singing in garage band, and also for video calling. The quality is excellent. Set up is very easy on the Mac. I definitely think it was worth the price of around $60.Highly recommended USB mic, whether you are doing voice overs, pod casts or music you can't go wrong with this."
2,Doesn't Work with Windows 7,"I never got a chance to use this microphone because it doesn't work with Windows 7. Maybe it would work with XP? This sells for $99.99 @ Best Buy and I'm not sure if that one would work with Windows 7, but Blue claims the ""cheap ones"" on Amazon are sometimes defective. Save yourself the headache and pay up for one that will work with Windows 7."
5,Worth my money!!,"I've been using the snowball for a month now, I use it exclusively for voice(audiobooks). I could not be happier with this product, period. I love it. It was the best 75 bucks I've ever spent. It may or may not be the best one for you, It was completely worth it to me..good luck"
4,Big mike with good sound and a good value for money,"I was surprised how big it was I expected something a tad smaller. I got this for a Mac Pro using OSX Leopard 10.5.5. Only tested with voice so far no musical instruments. The sounds is pretty good though I found one has to be fairly close to the mike in order to get clean background noise-free sound and a good volume, i.e. level of recording. The sound quality of the recordings is very good with a very nice range. Setup was a snap. Plug-it in and go to the Sound Control Panel in System Preferences under the Mac OSX and select the sound input to USB Microphone - that's it. I recorded with it in Soundtrack Pro and worked really nicely."
4,Good for vocals,"Like the title suggest it is wonderful with vocals and any kind of singing, it has a one note frequency that can pick up a solo really good, but do not attempt this mic for any kind of chord progression at all it will phase out quicker than a crack head."
5,Great Microphone,"Purchased this Microphone to record game reviews with friends. It works great when talking directly to it in Setting 1 or Setting 2.Setting 3 - Omnidirectional catches the sound pretty well around you and you can hear it clearly.This Microphone worked well for me using Mumble to also talk to friends over games. The microphone sounds quiet on Windows 7 Mic levels, even with 100 boost. Mumble settings made it sound great.I suggest this microphone if your using a sound based program which will optimize the sound. Works great in Skype too ""as if your actually there"". The red light on top gets annoying after a while."
5,Awesome. Best Mic out there.,"This is by far the best mic I've owned. This is the second one I purchased. Nothing wrong with the first, it just stayed at my old office. Test it before you use it. This mic even picked up the ticking from a clock on the other side of my office!"
2,Low pickup on MacBook Pro; Returned.,"Very low pickup on MacBook Pro / Snow Leopard, even with mic gain maxed out in Sound control panel. Supposed to be a late model, with ""high gain"" firmware already installed, so couldn't do anything. Returned. Two stars for fairly clean recording; may be useful for someone willing to hold mic close to face, and post-process."
2,Recording level too low,"It's pretty. It gets great sound, but the recording level is just too low.I went through two of these things, and here's the deal. If you are going to be two inches from it, or you are going to be recording loud sources, you'll be pleased as punch.If you are going to be recording the normal volume of a human voice, or you want to record a number of participants around a table, you will find that the recording levels are just far far too low.To make sure I didn't just get a bad one, I went through two of these and found exactly the same problem. I even spent a good deal of time with their customer support person (who seems to be a really swell guy) and there are no driver or firmware updates to increase the gain on this newer version of the microphone. It's just the way these microphones are designed.I ended up sending the two Snowballs back and purchasing the Audio Technica AT2020USB Condenser USB Microphone. The AT2020USB turned out to be just perfect for my use."
4,Blue Snowball review from a broadcaster,"For the price, this is an excellent mic. I use it for daily on-air broadcast applications. It is a little more hollow and tinny than I like, but it is not an $800 mic either. I use a simple batch conversion on Cool Edit to add some low end EQ and compress/limit what I record before airing and I think it it then easily rivals the expensive mics. Plus it is much easier to use in remote situations.Only problem: about 1 out of every 60 times, recording comes out distorted and with a static sound surrounding the audio. This could be a problem if you have a one shot deal of recording something and it happens, but again it is pretty rare. This may only be an issue I have with my mic/CPU combination.Overall, a solid 4 stars. For what you get for the price, I would give it closer to 5 stars."
2,Most overrated product I've returned in a long time,"This is like the product of some kind of fanboy propagandists. This thing is simply not that good. I did tests between it and my DARN INTERNAL MACBOOK MIC and most people could barely tell a difference.If it was 30 bucks, I'd say pick it up. But I'm a Jew and I love good value (that's the truth y'heard!?) and this is BAD value. Get a cheap Logitech or realize that you can just use your Mac's built-in. The kids are all on mp3's these days anyway.That's my take."
1,False Advertising,"I ordered this microphone at the same time as I ordered a FLIP camera on the understanding that they worked together. If they did, I couldn't figure out how once I tried it, so I sent it back, very disappointed."
1,Works fine after a lot of bother,"Update two years after buying it originally. It took a lot of bother and a lot of back-and-forth with the company; we finally had to ship ours back to the manufacturer for an updated chip. Once that was done, the microphone worked fine."
1,Older versions do not work unde Win& pro 64-bit,"I own this mic (3 years+) and since upgrading to win7 pro 64-bit the mic will not work. It is not recognised and the driver fails to install. Blue support could care less, don't respond, and have not provided a firmware or driver update. My mic is now an expensive desk ornament. If you are considering buying this mic - beware how old the seller's stock is."
5,"""A NIGHTMARE YOU WON'T FORGET!""","Sam and Janice move into their first home, and wind-up receiving the unexpected. As the couple talks to their neighbors, they find out disturbing news about a past owner named Isabelle, who in a jealous rage killed her husband and his lover in that house. Worst of all, it's nearly fifty years later, and Janice suddenly begins to sleep walk. She can also see visions of a woman and blood everywhere. Has Isabelle returned, and who is killing people in the neighborhood? This is a fright night delight for all thriller and mystery lovers. The characters are lively, excellent acting, and the nail-biting story leads to intense suspense. A Haunting nightmare you won't forget!"
5,a starring vehicle for Pauly Shore,"I am not a major comic book guy. A friend, however, a guy who is a comic book guy and figures that if he is a comic book guy then everyone should be a comic book guy bought me this book.(I have had a twelve minute of fame life...but when I mention it it is usually edited..................now we'll see if that gets edited.............). This comic book is truly hilariouus, and so true about the struggling hollywood thing. I howled at this piece and have read it many times. This has it all, digs at bad hollywood movies, the searching for stars(they run into Drew Carey, but decide that since he is from Cleveland and they are from cleveland then it is not a real star sighting)...the constant selling of yourself...on top of that, the amazing storytelling that goes on. I have since been into Bendis's work(but I""m not obsessed, Ok)_. This is an inspired work for anyone who feels like they want to become a hollywood writer. I thoroughly recommend it."
4,CD player,"The only problem I have is that I sometimes have problems getting the lid on the cd compartment to stay closed. Overall, it is a nice looking unit and works well, given the price."
4,Need a season 6,Well done crime drama. Nesbit is fun to watch as always. Gets progressively darker with each season (series). Check out Jekyll if you havent already. Brilliant.
4,The Holes in Your nose,"Certain people will find this book amusing and perhaps dated. I had a good time reading this book outloud, but admit to having blushed a few times and skipped over a few pages for the younger audiences. If you are looking for a chuckle, this book is it. If you are looking to teach or learn about the nose this is not it."
3,Recluce Redundant,I initially loved this series but at this point it is being stretched and thinned out in an attempt to keep the franchise going to the point where I am beginning to lose interest. The history of the Recluce world may be fascinating but this book is not. As usual there are complex issues of right and wrong dealt with as well as a very detailed backdrop of political intrigue. But less and less do I find myself involved and invested in the characters themselves. It's as if the standard formula for these books have overcome the unique and usually fascinating hero/anti-hero. The wonder and magic of the earlier books is getting scarcer as the series proceeds. I recommend some of the earliers books heartily but the later ones only for the diehard fan.
3,No box?,"Considering the Calvin Klein brand, I would have expected the item to come boxed but alas, no box. I wondered if it was genuine and was relieved it smelled like ""the real deal"" or close. I'm still not 100% convinced but it works; but for that price I'd rather be sure."
2,paper too thin,"colors in the print are fine, but paper is way too thin to frame and you need toadd additional backing to do the framing. very flimsy and easy to wrinkle when youare working with it. wish I had asked what type of paper this print would be on"
5,A phenomenal performance,"This DVD has an amazing performance that is captured visually from many interesting angles. The works performed are wonderful and the sound is remarkable, even on my two channel system. The (optional) technical material provided is very interesting. I use this DVD to show friends who haven't yet purchased a DVD player the potential of this medium. Highly recommended!"
2,Lifeless and fake,"Pipe organ music is, of course, best heard performed live, but I hoped that 5.1 surround sound would come in second (ahead of stereo). It does, but this pair of DVDs (BGOW volumes 1 and 2) is not worth listening to in any fidelity. There's something about the way Hans-Andre Stamm plays Bach, it seems lifeless. Perfunctory. Like he's playing the notes without feeling them. I'd rather listen to my cassette tape of E. Power Biggs playing Bach. The video accompaniment to the music is lame too, clearly staged shots of him scowling and pounding the keys. Stay away from these DVDs."
2,Coming Home,"I returned the DVD because it was evidently the ""edited for cable"" version and I wanted the full version. I will reorder but try to confirm it is the right version."
3,Good Teaching Tool,"While not the definitive source on bipolar, it is not campy, overly sentimental, or dramatic. It beats out the typical out-dated material that accompanies a number of college Psychology texts."
5,THE BEST FISHING GAME IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't mean to be dramatic or anything but this game rocks! This game gets boring my but! I got a fishing game for my ps1 and this game still kicks that game (or any game in the world's) but. Even if you don't like fishing you'll like this because it requiers no skill whatsoever.I liked unlocking new charecters but you can also unlock dogs, rods, hats, shirts and line. 5 Stages to unlock and so many posibilities. Listen to theese 3 words, do it.............BUY THE GAME"
5,Terrific Portable CD Unit,"This JVC CD player delivers!! The sound is great. It's easy to use, and resists shock pretty well. The two AA batteries that power it last a surprisingly long time. I've owned JVC products in the past, and they've all performed well. I like this one too. One problem is that the earphones while nicely designed, are not adjustable. To get them to fit properly, I have to hang them way down the head onto the back of my neck. Kind of clumsy, adjustibility would make these phones more attractive."
1,Disappointed - don't waste your money,"Not all 3 of the connections worked. When it was plugged in the picture was red and black. I tried it on a couple of different components and had the same problem each time. It didn't cost much, but I expected it to work."
4,PRICEY INK!,"I had a Printer once that the Cartridges would cost me over 80 Bucks plus Tax, after looking for a Printer with less expensive Ink Cartridges several years ago I found the HP Photosmart All-in-One Printer-Scanner-Copier which uses HP 92-93 Black and Tri-Color Cartridges. I never had any problems and replace them just about every month, they are on the Lower Price-Chart and I am Happy with the price at Amazon.com, the Combo Pack is a much better Price than my last place where I live and on top of that I had to pay the State Tax. Considering how High the Price of Ink Cartridges are and how little time they last, I am Glad I found them here, the Best Price that's for sure and Free Shipping! Thank You"
2,cheaper at Staples,"You can get this cheaper at Staples, either in store or online. I found it for $26.99, and that is a non-sale price. Amazon should lower the price if it wants to really be competitive in office supplies."
4,Decent,"It was a good camera that took decent enough photos both in and out of the water. Two things to consider about this camera though. The first is that the view finder does not accurately depict the picture you're about to take, especially since most the time you're using a waterproof camera is... well in the water, and most the time you're in the water you're going to be wear goggles, making the view finder an extra inch or two away from your eye. It's a minor inconvenience (which is why I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars), but one I think Kodak could have anticipated. The second issue is that this camera lacks a flash. So make sure it's a bright day if you want to take pictures underwater, otherwise you're pictures are going to come out dark."
4,France's Greatest Spy??,"I saw the Trailer for Lost in Rio at the Music Box in Chicago and had to see this movie. Jean Dujardin is the Suave, Hip Counter-Intelligence Spy the World needs! OSS 117 asking the German Embassy if they have a list of ex-Nazis hiding in Brazil is so funny because He is so sincere with his request. The movie is in French with subtitles but still an enjoyable Action Comedy. France's Greatest Spy? That is for others to decide."
3,Equal Opportunity Political Incorrectness,"Enjoyable, genial spoof of 1960s spy films. It's nice to see an ""ugly Frenchman"" instead of ""Ugly American"" for a change, as Jean Dujardin, blissfully ignorant, insults everyone from Jews to Chinese to Women to Germans, among others, all while trying to retrieve a list of French who collaborated with the Nazis during the Second World War. Not much action, even for a spoof of spy films, but more enjoyable than its predecessor, OSS 177: Cairo - Nest Of Spies, in that Dujardin seems more comfortable with his clueless character here. For Hitchcock fans, as the film reaches its climax there's an homage to Vertigo and North By Northwest, including Bernard Hermann's iconic film scores for both."
2,Cairo is better,"I would say the funniest part of the movie is the opening scene. Oh, and the chase scene in the hospital. As an American with no knowledge of French or French humor, I could be missing something, I suppose, but it seems that the other reviewers agree with me that ""Cairo, Nest of Spies"" was better. And since no one else has mentioned it, I suppose I should warn you that this contains a slight amount of nudity. For those of you who think this may be an additional reason to buy the movie, it isn't.Note: when I give a two star review, it doesn't mean ""I don't like it,"" it means ""if you have nothing better to do, it's not a complete waste of time."""
2,Something is missing here,"When I finished this book, I was left with such a sad feeling! My first thought was that Ms. Braun had passed on, and someone else wrote this book. The mystery at the end was never really solved, Quill just assumed who the culprit was. The story line of Polly and Walter was left hanging. The whole book revolved around Quill's vacation and the social happenings at Black Creek, rather than focusing on the mystery. Even the cats played a small role this time. All of the new characters introduced were not well fleshed out, and the old favorites just made some cameo appearances (Arch and Mildred, for example). Whomever wrote this (and I don't believe it was Ms. Braun) should go back and read the previous titles. Something is missing here."
2,Unanswered Questions,"This was like a quick phone call from an old friend where you get a two minute run down about what exciting things he's been up to lately - but no time for details.Who was that kid? Why was he with people who weren't his parents? Why was there gold in the heel of a shoe if gold wasn't the real treasure in the forest? What's the real story of Polly's mysterious travel companion?I kept waiting for all the loose ends to tie somewhat together and they never did.At the end of the book I wanted to say, call me back, I am dying to hear more and I have so many questions....."
3,Left up the creek,"Am I the only one who feels that Ms. Braun is not really supplying us with honest solutions to her mysteries? On more than one occasion, I have finished a ""Cat Who"" book feeling like I just stuffed on chips and salsa and didn't get any meat in my nachos. Although Qwill, Koko and Yum-Yum help pass an idle afternoon without requiring much thought on the reader's part, one is left with a curiously let-down feeling that there wasn't really a mystery. The clues aren't there, there is no villain looming in the shadows waiting to be exposed. This is entertainment, I guess, but no longer the substantive sort of mystery + solution that Qwill and Koko's whiskers used to winkle out."
2,A disappointment for fans,"I have been a long time fan of the Cat Who mysteries, but the last couple of books in this series have been a severe disappointment for me. What happened to the well-plotted story lines, the devious twists and turns, and the rich cast of characters?This last installment is just mystifying to me. It seems to be written in a desultory way, as if the author is performing an unwanted task, or filling an onerous obligation by doing the minimum necessary to get by.If Lilian Jackson Braun is actually still writing these herself, I would be shocked. Even if it is getting hard to come by fresh ideas and new characters, I can't believe someone's actual style of writing could change so much."
3,"Pleasant, but too many loose ends.","I always enjoy my trips to Moose county, but this book is too vague in too many ways. I wasn't really sure at the end that Qwill and Koko had reached the right conclusion at the end. I don't think the author was either. The characters of Moose County are entertaining as always, but the mystery really isn't that good. Hopefully the next will be better."
3,Nothing to write home about,"This product is good, not great. It has some features that are just so/so and others that are good. The junk files finder is a nice feature, but VERY slow! The registry fixer is below par. I find regseeker to be much better, and free! The defrag tool is basic, and once again, very slow.The incinerator feature is great. Don't even attempt to relocate software, it hasn't worked once for me, and created problems which took even more time to fix. I could go on and on, but you get the point.All in all, it's an OK product, but it definitely does not do it all!"
4,For anyone interested in television history this is great.,"As someone who has both written about and for television, I found this set utterly fascinating. These are live TV shows from the early Fifties, before anyone really knew what would or would not work, so there are lots of wonderful moments and groaners, but it all adds to the charm. You get to see actors who would later be big stars when they were just starting out, and you get a vibrant, authentic feel of the times. I enjoyed this set enormously."
3,Not bright enough.,I don't care for the side mirrors. The lights are not bright enough. I't okay. The light settings work good.
2,"Lighting Not Only Weak But Strange, Too!","Let me just say that I had a great Amazon experience - they shipped and then returned this mirror for no charge, which is much appreciated. I returned it because the lighting is not only too weak - and i do not have very high standards for the lighting, believe me, but also the way the bulbs are positioned is ridiculous. They have brighter bulbs on the top half and dimmer ones on the bottom half, so you're either top lit or bottom lit. When i read the complaints about lighting, i never saw this mentioned, and i figured somewhat weak lighting wouldn't be a problem. Again, i'm not a professional that needs super high wattage or anything, but the way this is designed is flawed - it makes it difficutl to see clearly and put makeup on."
1,Terrible lighting,"I was replacing a Clairol True-to-Light make up mirror with this one. This Conair one is uesless. You might as well just buy a regular mirror with no lights. The bulbs are dim to say the least. Don't waste your time. Unfortunately the Clairol one is no longer made, but I would suggest looking for something similar that contains two 6w or higher flourescent bulbs. This Conair one has two tiny bulbs that are about as bright as a christmas bulb."
4,Love this mirror!,"I received this make-up panel two days after ordering using standard shipping (Amazon is great in shipping its products quickly - thank you)!! I love the size, height, and light settings, particularly the 'day' setting which is bright. The magnifying side is super-magnifying and allows you to see every imperfection. I give it four stars only because the other light settings are not that bright, that's why I prefer to always use the ""day"" setting. Overall, happy with the product."
4,Best mirror around,"I'm glad to finally find this mirror. Had more than one over the last 35 years, and they're a great bargain. I really like the side mirrors - they aid in grooming the side and chin areas of your face.There may be some others out there for more money, but this one will do the job very nicely!"
2,That's what they call light?,"Anyone who thinks this mirror's lighting is good never owned a Remington ""True to Light"" mirror. I got this Conair mirror yesterday, and it will be going back tomorrow. It doesn't even come close to replicating real lighting conditions. The ""brightest"" light setting is a dull yellow color, at best. There is no way you can get a true picture of what your makeup really looks like by using this yellow light. The only reason I gave this mirror two stars is because the 5x magnification is really great, but the lighting is what I want the mirror for, and it stinks."
3,Make-up mirror,"The quality is good, but the lighting is not as bright as the old one, this one looks like an incandescent light bulb, and the old one was more of a florescent light, which was brighter. other than that, I like the mirror alot."
2,Not durable,"Good things: the lights are bright, the settings are useful, e.g. office, day, etc.Poor things: I had this mirror about two weeks and one of the doors broke off. When it's open, it's quite large and bulky in general."
1,i sent it back,"I ordered this make up mirror thinking it would be similar to the one I had. I travel some with my job and the mirror cracked in my luggage on a flight. I have used a make up mirror for many years, since I was in highschool and I am 53 now. The lighting on this mirror was terrible. You could almost see better before you turned it on...really do not waste your money. I sent it back. The exchange was easy. I was thankful for that. I did find and old model ""clairol"" lighted make up mirror...works GREAT and I saw Remmington lighted mirrors also...I used to have one of those too."
1,Very disappointing,"I can't see a thing in this ""lighted"" mirror--all of the settings, including Daylight, are so dim as to be virtually useless. It's going back."
3,Not Bright enough,The four settings are OK. But day should be a lot brighter. Can barely see to pluck my eyebrows.
4,Good but with One Minor Problem!,"This GE Slimline VHS Rewinder is good. It is nice to use this to rewind video tapes back to the beginning instead of having to use the VCR and wear out the heads! My only complaint is that some of our old blank media video tapes that are a lot bigger and bulkier than most other VHS video tapes do not fit in the rewinder. Actually they fit but the rewinder door will not close, it just pops open and if you can't get the door to close you can't rewind the tapes. But all in all a good product."
4,A good beginning to a series,"I heard about this series from another reader of cozies and thought I should give it a try. I really enjoyed this first book. I like Madeline-she's a real person, and the supporting characters are good too. It's a good mystery with lots of red herrings, and many suspects to choose from. Also the name dropping of big Hollywood names doesn't hurt either. We hear mention of Drew Barrymore, William Baldwin and a few others. It's easy to see that Ms. Farmer is acquainted with the Hollywood party scene. We even get mention about very good food, and that's not a bad thing either. I will definitely be continuing to read about Madeline and her partner Wesley in the other books in this series. Thanks to the person who turned me on to this series."
4,Gorgeous but more blue than picture...,"This ring came before the estimated date, in excellent condition. Fits nicely. Only thing is that it's more of a light blue than aqua, no green in it. But it's still lovely."
2,It's not a 5 star book.,"[...] It has some interesting concepts, but is really just a self-congratulating book by Mr. Chan. It was clumsy to read, filled with the words ""I"", ""me"", ""my"". If I wanted to study the life of Matthew Chan [...] then I would buy this book.Good luck trying to see the concepts through the puffed up speech. [...]"
5,A Must Read for Personal Freedom,"The Authors ability to explain that ""True Freedom"" is not just about MONEY but it is also about TIME, is very refreshing.He explores the ability to manage your personal life and business in order to maximize your Personal Freedom!A Must Read for anyone wanting to succeed."
4,Glue,"I bought this glue when I was doing mosaics. It worked fine on flat projects, but I was making gazing balls out of bowling balls and found that the glass did not stick to the ball if it was left outside over the winter by using this glue. The following year it fell off, so the next time I use glass on a gazing ball it will have to be a different product. This is a good product, just not for what I was using it for."
1,Very disappointing,"I found this book of absolutely no help whatsoever in trying to learn the basics of VC++. The examples given are either absurdly simple and repetitive, or completely undecipherable as new concepts are introduced without explanation. Thank God I only borrowed the book and didn't fork out the cover price!"
2,Spend 21 days fixing the Errors,I really didn't expect one book to make me a VC++ expert. The concepts covered by any VC++ book are large and complex. What I did expect was that the publisher would make an efforts to publish working code. If that was too much of a bother then at least provide information where the corrections could be obtained.
4,Excellent for Beginners!,"If you are a beginning programmer, then you will find this book to be of great value to you because of its detailed step-by-step instructions of what to do. However, if you are already somewhat familiar with object-oriented languages, including C,C++,Java, or JavaScript, then this book will be mostly review. Otherwise, this is a great book to learn the basics of Visual C++ and object-oriented programming"
3,"Nice book, but a little too tutorial","This book is nice in that everything is very simply laidout step by step. However, it doesn't explain the how orwhy part very well. After reading this book, you'll knowhow to do many things, but you won't really understand why.Most of the text is just a list of step by step instructionson how to accomplish a task. If that's all you want to do,then that's fine, but after reading 21 chapters, my feelingwas that I didn't really learn how to apply visual c++ tomy situation, but simply learned how to use the variousVisual C++ features like Classwizards, etc."
3,Speedy is the word!,"I was first introduced to Kimberly Fowler through Prevention Magazine. I read more about her and decided to purchase the DVD. The yoga poses were straight forward and fairly basic but the poses were way too rushed to be of any great benefit. Yes, you can pause the DVD but it's a pain when you are trying to 'flow' through your practice. I'm much more inclined to practice yoga with my favorite, ""Yoga Zone""."
1,Discredited,"Hamilton William's work is sloppily researched and cannot be considered a serious work of history. He seems much more concerned with grinding his own political axe than in presenting an accurate view of history. Other historians have dismissed his work as being closer to fiction than reality.A better study on the period of 1813-1814 is R.F. Delderfield's ""Imperial Sunset: The Fall of Napoleon 1813-14."""
4,Basic scale,"Nice basic scale. Simple and minimalistic. Does everything most want from a scale. Easy to adjust to zero it in. It's served me well over the years. May or may not be the most accurate but as long as it's within a couple pounds who really cares. Remember when it comes to weight-loss, don't base your results on the scale, base them on what you see in the mirror. If the mirror shows you what you want to see, who cares how much the scale says you weigh."
3,It's just OK,"I'm somewhat disappointed with Sony on this one.CONS: The volume dial is inconveniently located on the right side, low towards the back. The AM/FM analog tuner is a dial with numbers on it. No battery back up. My unit has a slight hum at all times -- don't know if that's typical, or if mine is just defective. Sound is just OK, not great. Not as compact as description would lead you to believe (still pretty large footprint).PROS: The clock display is large, with 3 brightness settings. Has Line-In for MP3 players.Overall, it's just OK. I guess I shouldn't have expected too much for about $40."
3,For the $35 it's OK,"I bought this during the mad Xmas rush to keep @ my desk @work. It's small enough to fit in the corner of my work cubicle.Actually, my rating would be a 3.5Cons: The volume control is inconveniently located in the right hand rear corner. if you keep it at the same volume,it's ok, you don't have to hassle with reaching to the back.Pros: a plus, the inline MP3 player connection, conveniently located in front. the large numbers for the clock; the CD loading is conveniently located at the top of the unit; the inline is very easy to use and connects instantly at the touch of a button. the top is black, so smudges, ink from your pen or oil from your fingers don't show up as easily as on white.For the $35 I paid at the register, it's OK for the money."
5,A Marriage of Entertainment and Education,"Eddie Murphy meets Alan Dershowitz and the result is funny, insightful, and informative. In Sean Carter's writing I found that all too elusive alchemy--a work that is so funny and entertaining, you don't realize how much you're learning. I certainly wish this book was available when I was in law school. The book provides a solid basis for lay people and a refresher course for lawyers who took the Bar Exam more than three weeks ago. The genius of Mr. Carter's book is his use of comical and off-the-wall examples from the headlines to explain the law. Unlike the dry, bland, moribund classical examples of law school (with names like Greenacre, Mr. A, Mrs. B...), Mr. Carter fills his examples with identifiable people and places--O.J., Pamela Anderson, George W. Bush, etc. I hope he has a good attorney to represent him when the defamation suits start....I highly recommend this clever opus."
4,floor scrub brush,"This will serve as my backup brush as i found it after getting what I wanted in a wooden one. As stated in that review, I do not them with handles. I do not think you can do as good a job s those without the added grip. It does not help, in my opinion."
3,Another enjoyable read by Heather Graham,"This wasn't my favorite Heather Graham read, but it was definitely entertaining. It was set in SouthWest Florida, so of course it included alligators and men who are not afraid of them. The main character was definitely interesting with an Indian/White background, so he was the intriguing peacekeeper who skirted both worlds, and obviously, every woman wanted him. Definitely worth the read."
2,Chopping Stall,"This movie was just inadequate. First off, the DVD quality is sub par at best, failing to reach an acceptable slasher standard. But for me the worst is just how lazy, cheap or whatever the director was. At several points there are windows covered by shades and you can see the sun coming through yet they ignore them. Did I mention it's night time and that they are trying to escape?Awful acting and comical script let down an otherwise good idea. It's like a TV movie with zero good special effects, I mean when the robots start firing Battle Beyond the Stars (1980) type laser shots, you just feel like puking.Also, there's the implausibility involved with the robot attacks. These things look like something rejected by Robocop (1987) for being too dorky or exceedingly cheap. These are just boxes mounted on traction.Don't waste your Robot heads."
2,Dumb as Hell,"Ok... I bought this movie in about 1992 or so expecting acool horror slasher film. With a title like CHOPPING MALLthat is what I would expect. What did I get? A movie withrobots shooting people with lazers. Where is all this""Chopping"" at? Maybe it seems alittle shallow, but thetitle of this movie just doesn't fit with what actuallyhappens in the movie. The plot is actually somewhat newin that we usally don't see store robots just go crazyand start killing people with lazers. But it simply isn'twhat I expected."
5,"Wonderful! Even better than ""Kissing in Manhattan""","In his first book, Schickler showed that he could create memorable characters radiating equal amounts of humanity and quirkiness. In ""Sweet and Vicious,"" the parade continues. Grace and Henry absolutely jump of the page, and even the secondary characters -- like Color or Gretl -- were clearly not just filler.Although there is a significant amount of magical realism in the book (think Tom Robbins crossed with Garcia Marquez), the story and the characters all seems so vivid. The imagery throughout the story is spectacular, from the car wash scene to the pod people to the tree-top dwelling to the diamonds themselves. Schickler is incredibly talented at creating situations that pull you in and, unlike with many writers, I never felt disappointed that the payoff wasn't equal to the setup.I think Schickler has really found his voice as a writer with this book, and I predict it will be a major hit."
2,Very Disappointing,"I loved Schickler's first book, Kissing in Manhattan, but it's hard to believe that this one was written by the same person. I was unable to connect with the main characters, and a lot of the dialouge felt unnatural and forced. Some of the subplots were engaging, but they weren't enough to carry the book. The ending didn't even have a sense of resolution."
3,A Pregram For The Kids,"The story is fairly close to the original and the music is representative of the opera. It is a good way to introduce children to the story of The Magic Flute, but not to the opera. I was disappointed to see that the video was a cartoon musical. I am looking for the opera performed in English."
3,depends what you exptected,"A collection of documentaries and military training films that show secrets and methods used to win the Second World War. Interesting if you like that sort of stuff, especially when you see how seemingly mundane some of the winning tricks were."
3,MICHAEL UPTON's igloomag.com REVIEW ::,"MICHAEL UPTON's igloomag.com REVIEW ::(07.08.06) ISAN make very nice music. They have the lightest, crispest percussion in the universe and layer cheerful melodies over soothing chords. The beats are never in your face, the bass tones are soft and rounded. For me they're something like the aural equivalent of high quality chocolates - every chocolate tastes great, but the sweetness gets a bit much too consume in one sitting.Plans Drawn In Pencil shows no great diversion from what ISAN have done before, but if you're looking for some relaxed electronica and are tired of your Boards of Canada records, this is a safe bet.>> igloomag.com <<"
5,Amazing!,"I absolutely love this book! I won't write a novel on it because I'd just as soon you read it yourself. Any woman looking for a little direction on her role as a Christian and a woman, this is it for sure.Phenomenal read! I think it is now my favorite book! :)"
4,Best Introduction on DVD,"Newly released, this is the best introduction to swinging on DVD. It would be helpful to a couple considering an alternative lifestyle. Contains a lot of useful information describing what is involved at different participation levels that would be helpful in evaluating whether swinging was something a couple wished to pursue further and if so at what level. The good information tends to become self serving as the actors portrayed seem to advocate for their commercial interest. I would have liked it better and it would have seemed more genuine if the actor-narrators were not operators of swinging establishments. It's worth buying and watching for anyone interested in an introduction and overview of the lifestyle."
3,Average,This supplement of the Fifth Age game is a little less than great. Most of the roles in the boxed set are not worth playing. The most useful thing in here is the adventure itself (if you like following the novels).
3,Pottery Barn Home,"I ordered a book Pottery Barn Home. It arrived here much earlier than indicated in the e-mail. However, I noticed that the book had a price sticker from Costco on it (and the price on the sticker was actually lower than the Amazon's price!), so it was obvious that it was a return from Costco. Amazon.com should at least remove the price sticker from another store before reselling them to customers. The book was in o.k. condition, with the dent on one of the corners from transportation."
1,DO NOT BUY BIC RAZORS!!!! THEY CUT YOU,DO NOT BUY THESE!!! I CUT MY UNDERARM VERY BADLY AND THEY WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE A PROBLEM WITH THIS RAZOR!!! BEWARE.....
5,Just what I wanted !!,This was exactly what I wanted & needed. It arrived well packaged & on time.it was in great condition and was very sharp.I used it right away.I am very happy.
5,Exceptional,"Nobody breaks down the choreography and teaches the moves as well as Jenna does and I have watched quite a few instructional belly dance dvds. One thing to note though, this is definately not for a straight out beginner. Its more for somebody who knows what the basics are and wanting to gain some techniques and expand their dance moves. She has become my favourite belly dance teacher. I know she has a new dvd coming out sometime in Summer 2006, I will definately get it. I recommend this dvd 101%! I wish other intsructors could do dvds as well as this one was done. Good job and for all those raks sharki dancers out there.....Go GET IT! :-)"
3,"OK, but not so exciting","This DVD is cheap and I think the quality is corresponding to that. Generally, it's OK but when I compare it for example to IAMED DVDs (of more than double price, I know), the quality is not so excellent. The movements are not so well explained (at least for me), many things are repeated more times so finally no so much content. The quality of the video is not very good, especially the lighting, sometimes it really seems to me like made by amateurs. Anyway, Jenna seems to be really a good dancer, her choreographies are nice and really from beginners to advanced levels, so something for everybody. I was a bit disappointed by thid DVD but for sure one can learn something from it."
4,The Heartbeat of Bellydance: Rhythms & Belly Dance combinations for Drum Solos,"Even though this DVD is yet to be released I have rated it with four stars because I believe that Jenna is a good drum soloist. From what I have seen on The Golden Apple, so I look forward to it's release :-)"
5,Goodnight we love you,"It's Phyllis Diller there is no way you can go wrong! The only thing to do is put the DVD on sit back and LAUGH! Watching this made me think of seeing her while I was growing up, brought back such good memories. I can enjoy it time and time again, I've even lent it out to a friend to watch with her mom."
3,Not Too Disappointing..,"I mean it's Jill Scott!I agree with another member who says you have to be a Jill Scott fan to really enjoy Collaborations. I was excited about some of the artist she teamed up with and I admit, not as good as I was expecting but not too bad either. It's definitley worth adding to your collection and the sample disc was quite good. I can't wait to hear from some of the soon to be released music."
5,I have listened to it everyday since I picked it up !!,"I may be a little biased because I love Jill Scott and I'm from Philly but I have to say I can listen to this CD all day. My favorite song, The Rain made the cut along with my other favorite artists Mos Def and Common so you won't hear many complaints from me."
2,MORE RAP MUSIC.,"I'M NOT A RAP LOVER. JILL HAD ABOUT 4 OR 5 SONGS THAT I LIKED. THE REST WERE NOT MY STYLE OF MUSIC.ALL THE JAZZ SONGS THAT I HEARD BY HER, ON MY RADIO STATION, WERE OUT OF SIGHT. THIS ALBUM WAS A LET-DOWN."
3,a good read,I really enjoyed the characters and the very believable storyline. I am searching for other books written by her. I have recommended this book to others.
4,Good Read,"This very enjoyable novel is a coming-of-age story with some mystery at its heart. It is also a very wise book about mothers and teenage daughters, about the many people who influence our lives growing up, and about coming to grips with loss. The main characters are vivid, likable (most of them), and believable. I had a hard time putting it down."
4,Good story,I enjoyed this read of small town southern life and a young girls coming of age. Life's lessons being hard at times but learning that the important thing is those who care for you an home. My only problem was the numerous typos. I found the quote distracting at times. I do recommend this book however.
5,This is the best product for killing ants!,"I've tried so many different ant killer and this one works like no other will.They devour this gel like they haven't eaten for years... then magically they start to gradually disappear.I have a dog, two cats, and two kids so it worried me to just squirt it on the ground or in a crevice where my dog could lick it so I found a small shoe box and cut a hole on each side to let the ants in and out of, taped the top down. Because they love this stuff so much it didn't take long for them to figure out where the 'good' stuff was.The shoe box wasn't a deterrent for them at all and I felt better knowing that the gel was safe from little hands and paws."
2,Combat vs Terro,"Terro has been my ant killer of choice for jeez, almost 10 years now. I tried it side by side against Combat in the new house and Terro (liquid bait) hands down wins. The ants were walking over the combat gel and licking their Terro death traps clean before they started to eat the gel. If those small house ants are your problem go with Terro.Terro Liquid Ant Bait"
1,No effect on the ants in our yard,"We have thousands of little black ants in our yard. A couple weeks ago, they started coming into the house, so I ordered some of the Combat Ant Killing Gel, along with the 6 Terro-PCO Liquid Ant Bait Stations to try to wipe out the colony. I put the gel and bait stations along various lines of ants in the yard. They did kill some of the ants that contacted the gel or bait stations, but had no effect on the colony. A week and a half later, we still have a million ants in the yard."
1,attracted ants to a few drops,"wow, this stuff is a ripoff, it give you about 6 spots of stuff and thats it. 27 grams is 6 spots of stuff that hardly works. you'd kill more ants if you purchased the spray at your local outlet. luckily, i didnt lose much money."
1,"Useless for me, AND arrogant customer service","I had a parade of ants traveling around the outside of my house, constantly. I laid down a good quantity of this stuff, across the path AND along it. The ants took no notice, either walking around it or through it. I never wiped it off, but it did nothing.I called Combat customer support and described my situation. The guy instantly started to look for ways to deny their ""guaranteed to work"" promise. When I said I left it on the house for a week and a half, he claimed that I had used the product ""incorrectly"" and said it would've killed the nest if I'd left it for 20 days!!!I was irate. These guys make an inferior product and they insult you to boot."
5,Works in less than 24 hours,"In less than 24 hours after applying the product to a piece of cardboard, the tiny black ants that used to be all over my bathroom were completely gone."
3,Too easy,"This was a nice, easy workout that I started about 8 weeks post-partum (and I had a c-section). However, after about a week of using it, I realized it was simply too easy and not getting my heart rate up where it should be. I went back to doing my original Tae-Bo workouts, which I love."
4,Great Price and Quality Product,I've used this product for making gomem syrup for use in cocktails. Its fine and has produced a nice silky smooth gomme (gum) syrup for me.
5,Good price for a good product,"Received my hangers in timely, Amazon fashion. I'm pleased with them and easily recommend them. They are of solid quality and well priced."
4,"This is an easy reading,practical guide that really works","This affordable text explains good and bad anger, the process of how we become angry, the appropriate expressions of anger, how to cope with our own anger and others anger, and how to make positive changes. This easy reading text also provides some charts and checklists to help with your own ""self-diagnosis"" and knowledge about anger, hidden anger, manipulation and becoming less angry with yourself. Attention is also paid to stress reduction, rational thinking and finally your own progress in dealing with anger. The emphasis is on taking personal responsibility for your anger as it is a choice and recognizing that we cannot change others any more than others can change us."
3,Rescue hero fans delight!,My grandson loved this. He is a Rescue Hero fan. I thought the stories were rather repetitive and uninteresting but what's a grandma to know.
1,RCA should change name to POS,"Worked fine for a while. To bad it was only for about two months. This was the SECOND RCA dvd player I had bought from Walmart after the first one died. I replaced the original thinking it was a fluke, giving RCA the benefit of the doubt. However, the DRC257N player continues to lock up after five to ten minutes of playing. It now sits in its original box in my closet."
5,Recreates the Sphere of Life,The book contains the golden secret of creating success and happiness within oneself. It teaches simple yet effective ways to find inner peace and untapped intelligence and talent.
5,Frogger is back!,"I loved Frogger back in the early days of video games. This remake has brought back the arcade game with improved graphics and an adventure with fun puzzle solving trickery and traps. Being a frog has never been so much fun! This game successfully mixes simplicity and modern gaming. It is easy to learn and control, so friends of all ages can easily pick it up and join in for some four player fun!If you have been waiting for a great Frogger come back this is it. If you find it repetative, just save and put it down for a later time. It is not always a good thing for a game to suck up hours of time without opportunities to escape and live life for a while. A great game for families and friends."
5,This game hits the SPOT!,"I was very pleasantly surprised by Frogger 2. I will confess to not being much of a Frogger fan in my arcade days, but I took a chance on this one. Definitely not regretted. What makes this game brilliant is that the controls are very easy to master (compared to many video games which require you to spend hours to master all the different combinations) and the overall concept of the game is simple to grasp. It's the kind of game you (and guests) can pick up in a minute! But that's not to say it's simple or boring. Like all great arcade games, it has that addictive quality that keeps you coming back for more. The depth here is in the level design, tricks, traps and the general coordination you need to get through it. The cute graphics and sound track just add to its appeal. Highly recommended. (I hope Majesco comes out with more titles as good as this one!)"
5,The best cookbook I own,"I bought this cookbook in the 1970s and it quickly became and still is my favorite cookbook. I have used it so much that the spine is giving out so I have been looking for another copy of it before it completely falls apart. I read in other reviews that there are many of us who feel the same way and wish that the book would be republished. The used copy I received was not the best and I am somewhat disappointed, but it will at least be the backup I need."
4,SATAN SCRUTINIZED,"KERSEY GRAVES HAS ENCAPSULATED ""THE DEVIL"" IN A CONCISE EASY TO READ MANNER. THOUGHT PROVOKING TO A TRADITIONAL BELIEVER AND ENHANCING TO SOMEONE ALREADY AWARE OF HIS ORIGINS. KERSEY GRAVES GIVES THE READER SCOPE TO CHALLENGE HIM/HERSELF AND COME OUT WITH A MUCH MORE REALISTIC AND BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DOCTRINE OF SATAN THE DEVIL - THAT OLD SERPENT AND DRAGON OF REVELATION. I THOROUGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY STUDENT AND THE BOOK HAS A WIDE MARGIN FOR NOTES."
1,I THOUGHT I NEEDED NEW GLASSES,I have this and I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in it. ALL the pictures are very blury. Almost as if they did it on purpose. It gave me a headach and the music was far from relaxing. I guess Jazzy should have warned me. Anyway I really don't like it and would never buy another from this company.
5,A MUST FOR PET OWNERS,"HAVING 5 CATS, FEEDING CAN MAKE A MESS. I BOUGHT 2 OF THESE DOUBLE BOWLS AND THEY ARE GREAT. EASY TO CLEAN AND THE CATS LOVE THEM."
3,Bergan Easy Dinere feeder,"This dog feeder is good for a small dog. If your dog is over 35 lbs, consider something bigger. Due to it's shape, you don't have a good grip on it when picking it up from the floor, unless you use both hands. Although it holds about up to 2 to 2 and a half cup of food, I think I would prefer a feeder a little bigger for my 40 lbs dog. Unfortunatly it only comes in one size."
2,Dog bites on plastic,I bought this product after reading some good reviews. But the dishes don't sit well inside the casing. The dog started chewing on the bowls and spilled water and food many times. Don't recommend this product.
3,Solar Powered,I love that it is solar powered but in a dark bathroom you have to wait a bit for it to register the light. The only real issue with it is that it is too small. I only weigh 116 and I'm 5 ft tall but I can occasionally step on it and it will tilt on you. Dangerous for an older person. I ended up putting it in my guest bathroom and purchasing a much larger base one.
2,For Die-Hard Fans Only,"The songs in this compilation were re-recorded by the original artists, which means they are not the original versions of the songs, with the exception of ""Somebody Else's Guy"" and ""I Second That Emotion"" - those are the only two songs that are the original versions.I would only recommend this compilation if you are a die-hard fan of any of the artists in this compilation. Some of the versions of the songs are pretty good, others not so good."
3,Luke Vibert's Trip to Hop.,"Luke Vibert's newest outing ""Musipal"". Cleverly made and perfectly produced as you could expect it from the guy, though without any real surprises. Needless to say more, people will buy it anyway."
1,This should be fiction.,"See the title. If you've read this book, you'll know what I'm talking about. This is mostly an embellished tale of Jolly Jack's life."
1,Well...,"There's always that man you hear about, and because his name kept popping up on the news, I found this book used at [...] and decided to give it a read. In all honestly, I wasn't suprised when I didn't agree with anything Mr Thompson had to say. But after reading it, I do believe the man is entitled to his own opinions.As far as the book itself, it's terribly one sided. It reads as if theres a debate, yet only pushes his point of view without mentioning anything else. So in that aspect, I was rather disappointed. I also felt that the book lacked serious content. It seemed as if most of the book he was rehashing the same material. In my opinion, if you have to rehash your material over and over to get people to listen to you, I really don't feel you should be writing a book."
1,One-sided,"I found this book to be far too one-sided in it's arguements. If the author truly wanted to present their debate in a meaningful manner they failed miserably. The view that opposes the author is not even mentioned clearly, and for the most part not at all. I would like to know more about where the author had published his research, but I think that would be a useless point since this seems like nothing more than opinion."
1,Toilet Paper,"Yep, that's what this book is. Who is really going to believe this hypocrisy this hack writer has to say? This is all biased, opinionated, and easily debatable subject matter. Are certain video games really that bad for your children? It's not like your children will live a life completely devoid of profanity.Well, congratulations Jack Thompson. You just made yourself look like a fool. You're even worse than Ann Coulter, and that's rather sad."
1,"Repugnant and insip, and at times offensive","To say that I struggled ready this would be an understatement[...][...]Though admittedly, he spends much of the book dealing with his schooling, his battle with howard stern, janet reno,and near the end, the game industry, [...] that any cognisant message is lost.[...]I for one am glad I did not pay for this garbage, as it would have been a waste of money."
1,"Same old, same old","The author argues that video games make us more likely to kill and generally do stupid things. As a proof, he offers bible quotations and made up anecdotes.This is exactly the kind of idiocy people said about jazz and rock music 40-70 years ago, and also what some pundits later said about comics, TV and video violence. No one takes that seriously today, and no one will take the author of this item seriously in a few years time either.The writing is also surprisningly poor for a lwayer who supposedly is trained in expressing himself."
2,This is a Conservative?,This is a Conservative? This is so much more in line with the worst of nanny state leftism. Tipper Gore would be proud.
3,"Small & ""colours"" version","I have Everyboby Poops by Taro Gomi-little did I know this was Everybody Poos. It is also a mini version of the ""typical"" size book which was a disappointment. However shipping was fast and product was on prime condition. Would use seller again."
4,Good for what it's worth,"The claim of 'learning to listen & speak guaranteed' is a little loose here. Yes you will if you work at it, but only on a beginner's level. That being said, for what is program is worth, it is very fun! Think of this as a interactive phrasebook. For most languages the same list of phrases is given. Things such as what you would say at a bank, hotel, etc. A few of the languages have cultral notes along with the phrases. Please note that (as I see it) only 76 of these languages have any sound related to them at all. The other 25 are in a flashcard format which make it hard to memorize, understand, and get a feel for the language. If you want to delve deeper into a language, check out TL's language now! series, Vocabulearn, or Pimsleur."
2,Entertaining,"I love comparing and hearing the sounds of different languages, and this product has definitely given me much enjoyment. You can probably learn some good phrases and vocabulary, but as other reviewers have already said, this is more of a sampler, than a serious language product. To go deeper, go elsewhere.The pronunciation feature, where you speak into the microphone and have your pronunciation judged against a native speaker, looks cool, but it's useless. It took me awhile to figure that out, but for fun I tried speaking Japanese like Goober of Mayberry and got a much better rating than when I tried to sound authentic. I promise I'm telling the truth here."
3,Description,"A wedding deception?""I want you to be my wife.""Kyle had asked Liane to marry him not once, but twice, which at least should have argued sincerity on his part. Or, perhaps it was just determination-- if he was serious, wouldn't he have told her that he loved her?Seven years ago, Liane would have had no doubts. But then their affair had ended in bitterness and anguish, and she hadn't seen Kyle since. So how could she be certain that he wasn't just out to get his revenge?"
3,Very different from the first,"As everyone knows, Takashi Miike directed the first movie. He's kind of controversial -but he didn't bring any of that into the movie. You need to see that movie first.The movie brings us back with that familiar cell ring that makes you want to hide, a new option of taking someone's call for them, and news that the girl from the last movie - she's in a mental hospital. It picks up fast, with a knowledable detective and scared friends. The difference this time is no candy ball. Investigation leads them to a completely different place, with a new source seeming to have teamed up with the old one. It's not so suspenseful, not as scary as the first, but definitly worth the viewing."
1,Don't waste your money,"First: This is not Bruce Lee. Second: this is just a partial remake of Bruce Lee's ""The Game of Death"". I say partial because it ends before he enters the tower to continue the fights."
2,Very boring......,"Very boring, my 3 months old son just ignored this video in the beginning and then just started crying, although he loves Sesame beginnings and Baby Einstein DVD. Overall, waste of money.."
2,gave it away,Ive never tried kc bar-b-q so i didnt know what it was going to taste like. When i finally got it i took one bite and eewwwww not the greatest taste.......not like any bar-b-q ive tasted. Jack links should take this beef steak off the market.......maybe ok for older people that cant tolerate hot food.....my older friend really liked it so i gave it to him. try the peppered beef steak by jack links its the best by far.
3,Salty,"My husband loves beef jerkey, and he will not eat these. They are way too salty. Maybe some people won't mind the salt, but for us, it was too much."
4,only kind,"this is the only kind of peppered beef steak i buy.it's always very fresh.and taste better than the other brands,if you like jerky i would recomend this product."
3,maybe a 6 on a 10 point scale,"Jack Link's Beef Steak, Flavor, 1-Ounce PackagesThese are a nice snack, maybe a 6 on a 10 point scale, I prefer theBuffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots (120 beef sticks per bag)Gunner March, 2010"
1,Like licking a salt cube! 1470mg of Sodium!,"After trying the teriyaki flavor of these beef steaks, I decided I would try another flavor so I ordered these peppered ones. The flavor is really like throwing a salt and pepper shaker into your mouth. You never really get a chance to taste the meat since your tongue is overwhelmed by this cloyingly salty, stale pepper flavor. The worst part? There is 1470mg of Sodium in a single package, which is a whopping 61% of your daily value of sodium for the ENTIRE day."
5,Best Price you will ever find,"We all know Jack Link's is an excellent product. Dates were excellent and you will never find a better price anywhere so go ahead sign up for autoship and enjoy healthy protein anytime.Jack Link's Beef Steak, Teriyaki, 2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)"
3,Could stay a little fresher since vaccummed sealed,"Even though these are in sealed, individual packages, which is nice, it seems like they don't retain there freshness. A few of the sticks got like shoe leather and had little taste. I would not purchase them again. I think they should have more flavor since they are vaccummed sealed for freshness. Also the sticks get very hard."
1,Poor copy,"This jerky is; tough, fat, has gristle, and does not taste like teriyaki. They do not even try to make it with the right flavorings. If you like teriyaki get another product."
3,ok,This gun didn't last very long around my little one. He had it broke within a week. It did serve its purpose those and lasted throughout trick or treating dispite being dropped multiple times.
4,Like it a lot,"The price was great, the gun has nice sound...my 7-yr-old's only complaint is that it should be a 2-pack since Jango uses 2 guns."
3,Looks great...BUT,"Gun looks great and worked well for my son's Halloween costume. Our trigger sticks and won't stop making the (very annoying) shooting sound. That said, my 6 yo loves it and still uses it. Bottom line... Works great for a costume, but 3 stars because the trigger sticks."
2,Odd Choice for Nancy,"This is purely a collection of torch songs, which is an odd and unsatisfying artistic choice for Nanci. Her voice has never been her strong suit, so it seems strange to select a genre of music that relies so heavily on the vocals. Also, Nanci's style seems to be getting more and more laid back with each album release, now almost to the point of inducing sleep. I am a long time Nanci fan, and I long for the days when Nanci's sound was more aggressive and challenging. The CD packaging was barren of any extras -- no lyrics, few pictures -- which makes me wonder if there was a reason why Nanci's label put as little into this project as possible.I've been wrong before. I had a similar negative reaction to Flyer, but it eventually became one of my favorite albums of hers. I doubt, however, that it will happen again with Ruby's Torch."
5,"If you need this product, buy it here","If you need ph adjustment this saves you a trip to a local store where you'd spend as much or more to buy this product. With my amazon prime service I can get it here quickly and save myself the trouble of going to the store.I purchased PH Down and PH UP just in case I needed to undo one of my adjustments. After all, you bought a SPA to relax, not so you can spend your time doing maintenance."
3,GLB pH Down,"I ordered the GLB pH down product for use in our pool. The ingredient was the same as the initial product I had gotten from our pool installer. The product arrived in a timely manner, but the container was only 1/2 full. I did not return it only because it was not expensive and I really needed to treat my pool with it. The product that I got did seem to work well."
1,A waste of paper--can't believe a tree died for this,"This was a very blah, nothing book, and the time reading it was a total waste. I don't know how she found anyone to bother publishing it. Much ado about nothing, pointless ramblings, nothing special going for it except that it was blessedly short."
3,Normal rock with a little bit of Mike Patton thrown in,"Well, you never know what to expect from Mike Patton. This time around, he decided to do a relatively normal rock album. By normal, I mean more tuneful than the Fantomas--not necessarily normal by radio standards. The problem with this album is the simple fact that if Mike Patton weren't singing, this would be just another generic rock band. It seems like Mike is trying to find a medium between Faith No More and the Fantomas with a little bit of country added to it. Some of this stuff is great, but too much of it sounds the same. Songs like ""Cul De Sac"", ""Laredo"", and ""Sweet Smell Of Success"" should be stuck in your head in no time though. This isn't a bad album at all, but it's not very thrilling either."
5,Really Nice...! Excellent !,It's a book that every baseball fan must have in your library. It's a MUST ! Nice pictures.
1,"Good, but 06 is free.","don't waste your money. the 2006 version is availible for free download at sportsmogul.com yeah, no reason to buy this. greatly addicting!"
2,Bad Country,"Of all the bad albums a consumer can find, there is not a more dismal or disappointing buying experience than wasting 15 bucks on a bad country album. Bad rock n' roll can sometimes be deceptively passed as ""alternative"", bad jazz as ""avant garde"", etc... Though consistantly hailed by critics alongside Dylan's landmark electric-era albums, (""Blonde..."", ""Highway..."", ""Bringing..."") ""John Wesley Harding"" is one such country album. With the exception of the historic ""All Along the Watchtower"" and the quaint piano of ""Dear Landlord"", it is a supreme failure. All of the critic-speak in the world about how John Wesley H. is his ""sleeper album"" and that it's ""deliberately understated"" cannot hide the fact that the songs are simply uninspired and monotonous. Add to the mix Dylan's forced twang (which improved with practice on ""Skyline"") and a band that shuffles through the tunes like a bunch of Nashville geezers, and you have the recipe for... yep, you guessed it,..."
1,Yuck!!,"This Book is soooo Lame. I can't believe someone even bothered to publish it. It's ten times worse than the movie, and the movie's pretty bad. It's like they took every stupid idea that had too do with Ella Enchanted and put it in this book. Reading it was just a major waste of my time."
5,still the best book on route 66,"I read Wallis' original book some years ago and now he has offered us an update. It is now 75 years since the highway numbering system went into effect, and more than ten years since the original book came out. What we get is an extra chapter in the back outlining some of the many changes that have occured in the past decade. Some old friends of the road have passed away; and a whole lot of new ones added. One gripe. We don't hear how Angel and Juan in Seligman are doing these days. Experienced 66 hands will know who I mean--the rest of you, make sure you find out about those two fine gentlemen. This, new, book will help you on your way. Highly recommended.2006--I should mention that Juan Delgadillo, the ""Juan"" in my review, passed away Summer 2004. Regrets. He seemed like such a genuine character."
5,Route 66: The Mother Road 75th Anniversary Edition,I travelled the Mother Road in September 1960 in a 1956 Ford from Chicago to LA. The book refreshed many memories of this trip. I was quite happy to go through the pages and I will continue to do so.
5,entertainingly informational,"Brought back some great memories of my childhood that I want to share with my own children. Made me want to start my engine....Anyone can ride on the see-the-same thing interstates, but riding along Route 66...now thats entertainment, thats a feast for your eyes, thats a great ride!"
5,Awesome reading,"For those of us ""boomers"" and the ""older"" generation who remember Route 66 and the television show of the same name this book is a 'must have'. I highly recommend this book to any and all who fondly remember the 'good ole' days when life seems a bit more pleasant."
1,"Wow, what a mess","This book seems hastily written, poorly edited and badly structured. Why did he pick Java? The author doesn't seem to understand Object Oriented design or patterns. The only point of the book, that I can see, is to scare people away from writing a compiler. There needs to be a good modern compiler book but this isn't it unfortunately."
5,Breathing improved,"I normally have a terrible runny nose all winter long. With these filters, I have been breathing much better all year."
5,amazing...,"incredible cd. they redid the acoustic songs ""i should have known"" and ""broken wings"" and they did an amazing job. my condolences to the band and the family of scott gottlieb."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a Steve and Eydie fan and have a number of their cd's that are have been re-released on their own label, but found this cd disappointing, both in the songs on the disc and the overall sound."
3,"Worth the price, but not much more.","The price was right for this knife, but it doesn't take as good an edge as I would have liked. I bought a Rough Rider brand knife of this type which I much prefer."
3,It's all about fan service,"Kanenone Academy had been an all boys high school until a coed integration experiment. Yusuke is the head of the welcoming committee and is surprised by Midori. Midori claims to be his lover from a previous life. The story follows the two as Midori as she tries to rekindle her former romance with Yusuke. There are also a lot of overly perverted boys that are trying to get it with the new female students.This story is fun to watch, but it's one of the most perverted and over the top animes I've ever seen. There are some interesting characters and some emotional moments. Even so it's purely about fan service. The animation and the voice acting are both mediocre at best. On the up side it's a fairly cheap series. I was able to by it for $9.99. I would say it's probably worth that much just for the fun factor alone."
3,Edsel should have left well enough alone,5 stars for the actual recording effort on the bands part...1 star for the remaster disaster on Edsels partSome people dont know when to leave well enough alone......The bass is weak and muddy ...the mids are weak and notched way down...and the highs are excessively overdriven...to the point of being harsh and unlistenable..causing major listening fatigue.I have waited for several months for the release of these 3 double cd sets by Edsel.....I just gave them a listen....and all three sets must have been done by the same guy.....a guy with a severe tin ear.The booklet is excellent....but do yourself (and your ears) a favor....if you have the earlier cd vrsions....stick with them....they're head and shoulders above this.
3,"Live at the Forum, eh?","Live at the Forum sounds like a bootleg, so don't expect the sound quality of Around the World with TDN. The sound of Harmony is compressed with more bass sound than the MCA version. If you like less compression and tinny sound get the MCA release, if you like more bass get this one."
2,Review of Middleware Networks,"I'd like to be kind, but--it's awful. Not cohesively written and very limited in its readability. A potentially useful topic treated with a heavy techno-hand..."
2,Not worth it at all,"I've read a number of parts of the final draft of this book for a class and it's a piece of junk in my opinion. The class, taught by Prof. Lerner himself wasn't any good either. His technical knowledge is excellent by any standard, yet his inability to convey it cocisely and cohesively for a class and in written text don't make this book worth it at all for anyone that is not extremely technically literate and would rather get insights and think of things for himself, as opposed to reading a direct description of the topic."
5,A wonderful end to Skye's Legacy,"If you loved Ms. Small's previous tales of Skye O'Malley and her family, you'll love this one, too. The bonus in this book is that you get not one romance but three! All three of Skye's great-great-granddaughters resemble her in appearance, but their lives are not quite as exciting as Skye's was. No matter, because Ms. Small once again has created three fascinating heroines that are easy to sympathise with. Background appearances of other inhabitants of Ms. Small's 17th century England will make you smile.A fitting and wonderful end to the Skye O'Malley Legacy series."
2,Bittersweet but much needed ending,"Having diligently followed these families over the years it was very sad to see it come to an end. But it was a necessary end. These families have been strung so far out you take up half the book reciting the family ties. I think it was bizarre to write this in a 3-n-1 book. I don't know why it wasn't just one story line. Its not like all Bertrice Smalls other books didn't have multiple story lines and we managed to follow along. I thought Fancy's story was the strongest and most interesting and should have been the main story in the book with the other cousins as the sub stories. Not a bad read strong start, boring middle, rushed ending but good closure for the story line."
4,Wow!,"One of the things that I never planned on doing is writing a review of a sweeper.This thing is tremendous. It was downright scary how much it got out of my rugs that the ol' Dirt Devil didn't. It's comfortable to use, glides well, and is very quiet. There are a couple of things that could be done better...the hose should be longer and it would be nice if one of the cord wrap hooks rotated so that you could drop the cord off instead of unwinding it.I now understand why someone would pay $$$ for a one of these things. Gald I didn't have to."
3,not for the squeamish,"this is a fairly decent flick zombie type flick.it's not your runof the mill for the genre as far as how the zombies came to be.thatstory is actually pretty interesting.i liked that original aspect ofit.the zombies themselves don't make an appearance until over halfwaythrough the movie,but once they do,things get ugly and bloodydisgusting.the movie is more of a dark comedy and quasi-spoof thanhorror,in my opinion.it pays tribute to(or rips off,depending on yourperspective),many classic,and not so classic horror films.it's notoriginal,but,like i said,the set up is great.but it is lots offun,(even funny at times)very entertaining,and fast paced.there arealso some great songs in the movie.i will definitely seek out thesoundtrack.for me,Trailer Park of Terror is a 3.5/5"
2,Not So Bad.......,"One day in my local video store, I saw this movie for sale and I purchased it being the ultimate horror fan. I've seen worse movies!! Taking place in the woods makes this movie pretty good. The plot: a psychologist takes a group of students into the woods so they can face their phobias and try to get over their fears. But there is something else in the woods... a wooden mannequin named Morty! Now everyone must truly battle their fears in order to save their life. Some cool scenes in this one. Worth seeing....... I've seen Worse movies!!"
3,Decent little dust collector,"I wanted a dust collector that would fit under the table saw outfeed table, to avoid having pipes or hoses blocking the aisles or interfering with the work. This one does that, and works fairly well. I like the spring loaded clamp on the bag, but emptying the bag through the small intake hole is kind of a pain. Another beef is that it was not packed for shipping very well: the intake port was at the bottom of the box, with only a quarter inch of styrene foam between it and the cardboard. Naturally the intake cover was pushed into the fan by the time I got it. At least Grizzly cheerfully sent me a new part right away.I wish someone made a 1.5 horse unit in the same low profile configuration, as the 1 hp model can't quite pull all the dust from under the saw and from the blade guard at the same time."
5,Great Tools,"I;ve had the 18v set for about 2yrs (since they first came out)These tools are excellent!IMHO they have excellent balance and power-to-weight ratio. Outstanding durability and from my expierence, GREAT battery life, sometimes I wear out B4 they do!Dropped numerous times from height (>10') with no problems.The flashlight is the weak link here - not very bright and the buld burned out within the first 15min - I never replaced it so I can't say how nice it is."
2,You get what you pay for,"I should have saved my $100 and bought a real drill. For less than $100 you should not expect to get a real quality tool. The first time I used the drill was after the return period expired. Drilling a 5/8"" hole into metal was enough to stall the drill and cause a very long wait for the thermal circuit breaker to reset.The drill is an obvious low quality low cost product.If you are a home owner using the drill just once in a while and do NOT drop it you are may be happy with it."
2,Weak batteries,"This drill was purchased to replace a 14 volt drill purchased close to 15 years ago from Snap-On. That drill was a work horse replaced only because the charger stopped working. With the new drill I am disappointed in the amount of work you can do before needing to change batteries. I realize the need to keep the battery small enough for the drill to be manageable, but I estimate getting 2X the amount of time with the old drill VRS. the new before needing to change batteries. . One of the reasons I went with the Ni-Cad battery instead of a lithium was price and the proven technology surrounding the nickel battery. I do not recommend this drill to someone who puts a tool through its paces. It might be a good drill for a casual hobbyist needing a larger cordless with more power, but if you ""drive your tools hard"", you should look elsewhere."
3,Fine for the first quarter O Chem.,I read all of these reviews and decided to check out O Chem for Dummies and O Chem Demystified from the library before purchasing. The dummies book was certainly an easier read and was good clarification since I took the upper level o chem without taking gen chem first. The book really doesn't cover much material and if you are in the class for the long run (the whole series) then buy the demystified book which covers the entire year's worth of material to a depth that will actually help you be successful in class.
4,Nikon DK-20 Rubber Eyecup,It is a replacement for my lost one. It is comfortable for the eye when using the viewfinder.
4,BIC Razors,"I used to be able to find a very good BIC razor called the Comfort Twin. It was a good razor for a person with a sensitive face. I last found that razor a few months ago at Walgreens in a 2- pack. The Amazon photo of their product was the same razor as I liked, but when they arrived, the razor was different in its shape and color. I have found this razor to be a very good razor. I would buy the box of 60 razors again."
2,reprinted but not corrected,"I know the author and the previous publisher seems sad that a good book did not even try to correct errors from the first publication. It was a truly great early study of Vietnam but fails to add the additional facts since discovered.I was there.........Joe ""Doc"" Kralich 4/31, 196th LIB 1969-1970"
5,Exactly,Exactly what I was looking for. A perfect replacement to the plastic bottom in my crate that my little Goberian decided to break one day in a little fit.
3,"Lousy sound, great performance","The sound is lousy, AM radio quality, but this is worth buying just the same. Such a great performance. Kid Creole is a great songwriter and his performances are great live acts.The visual part of his performances is so fun and powerful, I can't understand how it is possible that this is the only Kid Creole DVD available in the market at this moment!!!Producers should check out their vaults for Kid Creole tapes...But please, with a decent sound!!!"
2,Old & Outdated material,"This video has old and outdated material. While some of the footage was interesting, the footage was fuzzy. The apprears to be a DVD of a VHS video."
4,Good Product!,Good product works well in the Epson printer. I have tried some generic and they don't work as well as the Epson brand ones.
2,GREENBLATT MAKES WILL NEFARIOUS TO SELL BOOKS,"Despite a strong first half, this book diminishes in the second into a mere hack work instead of a first-rate scholarly piece largely due to Greenblatt's decision to become an A.S.S. [another secular scholar ]and aim at high sales;instead of remaining focused on the greatest writer to ever live, he spices the narrative with little-known saucy tidbits such as the ""Dark Lady ""of the sonnets was a negress and Will really DID have a thing for his daughter. These lurid details on top of Greenblatt's firm conviction Shakespeare was bi-sexual only besmirch the great playwright's reputation. To this end, this piece becomes just another post -freudian pscyhoanalysis obssessed with sex. Miss it if you can and read a respectable bio published when scholars had integrity and purposively did not destroy their heroes because of Freud."
4,Shakespeare Imaged,"Stephen Greenblatt is a brilliant Renaissance scholar who utilizes his knowledge of that world to create a biography of William Shakespeare. In 400+ pages, Mr. Greenblatt reconstructs the playwright's life out of the merest of clues, for Shakespears lefted very little documentation behind of his life. Legal papers concerning his birth, marriage, children's births and his death constitute the bulk of the surviving documents from that era.The reader is cautioned that ""Will In The World"" is a tour de force of conjecture. Mr. Greenblatt may be making an educated and deductive guess but still a guess about the very large gaps of our knowledge of Shakespeare's life. Having said that, the book is so well-research and well-written that it is a nominee for the National Book Award. It is a wonderful introduction to the world of Shakespeare and Elizabethan England."
3,Interesting but assumes a great deal of knowledge,"The author tentatively ties many sections of Shakespeare's plays and sonnets to life events. He does an excellent job of teasing out connections between historical events and Shakespeare's works.But he also assumes a good knowledge of Shakespeare's plays. I've read a few of his plays, but I was often lost as he described the connection (without much background) between a character and a person in Shakespeare's life or history.Greenblatt makes a lot of guesses (mostly intelligent ones in my opinion), but he is clear about where he is making assumptions and why.Also, note that this is not a really a biography (more of a psycho-literary analysis), but given the lack of documentation about Shakespeare, it may not be possible to write more of a biography than what Greenblatt has done."
4,Very feminine floral fragrance,"Like the original Eternity, Eternity Purple Orchid is a sweet-smelling scent, but it is much more flowery than its parent fragrance. Upon initial application, the Purple Orchid has an intense floral bouquet that is a bit strong for my tastes. Over time, however, the scent becomes significantly softer, making the flower notes more subtle and taking on a more powdery, slightly musky quality. This makes Purple Orchid a pretty, muted daytime fragrance, although it might be too delicate for those who prefer a bolder perfume."
5,Weather stripping,"What can I say, I bought this to replace so cheapo strips from a few years ago, much better and keeps the drafts out."
1,Before you buy,"Before you buy from this company, try to contact their customer service department in case you experience any problems in the future. I'm not sure a customer service department really exist at MPIO. Unbelievable. I've been trying for months to no avail.I liked my MPIO because of the small size. But the display disappeared after nine months(and the manual isn't well written). Without the display,I have no way of being sure what I'm doing when I push buttons. I've given up on them. After calling and emailing tech support for five months, I'll go with a company that demonstrates that the it truly values its customers."
5,Variety Pack Offers Great Deal,I liked the variety of colors offered in this package attached with a super pricetag.
5,A sea faring smash,"If you don't like complicated battles, mysterious poems, and small creatures, DON'T read this book!It's full of them1 Mariel of Redwall is about a young mouse maid(Mariel) who is shipwrecked with her father on the island of the horrible fort housing Gabool the Wild, King of Searats. But she is washed away again to the shores of Redwall Abbey. There Mariel is taken into care for she has no memory of the past. Then she remembers everything and makes an oath to find her father and slay Gabool. Mariel sets out-accompinied by her friends from the Abbey- on a journey that teaches her wit, skill, love and courage. At some parts in the book you're at home in the Abbey and in others your leading a great war. It fills you with relaxation and excitement, love and anger. There are funny parts and intense imagery. This book is full of life!"
4,"""Evil destroyed evil, and good triumphed""","Mariel of Redwall is a classic quest tale, with a feisty girl (mouse) as the protagonist. When Mariel and her father, Joseph the Bellmaker, are captured by the pirate sea-rat Gabool, along with the great bell being shipped to the fortress of Salamandastron, and Mariel is tossed into the sea tied to a rock, all seems lost. She escapes though, acquires allies at Redwall Abbey and along a Road of Trials, and helps overthrow the pirates of Terramort.I enjoyed *Mariel* for the characters and inventions of the author -- maternal badgers, resourceful hare soldiers, thuggish sea-rats. The use of dialect is appropriate, and world-building is small but clean. The atmosphere of place -- whether the peaceful fields of Redwall Abbey or the claustrophobic path through the swampdark -- is well crafted. Okay, it's a kid's book. Get over it; great writing, decent plot, wonderful characters!"
4,another good one,"Redwall just continues to be a fun place to visit. Mariel is a fun portrayal of both a female and male who discover the warrior within them. B. Jacques has created a refreshing world where good is good, and evil is abhorrent. With multiple threads running through this tapestry, there are many nights of late-night reading to be anticipated!"
4,having read the entire REDWALL series outloud......,"to my son, starting when he was 5 and ending with this book now that he is 7 1/2, i highly recommend them for any child who is a good listener. my son loves all these books, especially the crazy hares that eat their way through every story. mariel was not my favorite but still worth the read. it did not have as complex a plot or the 'excitement' as some of the others. partly, i may be growing immune to them, having read so many. and now i see there is a new one. sigh.....but a great Christmas gift nonthe less...."
4,this book was great!,"in this book like almost all of his other books, jacques used a few different plots and storylines. i think that makes his books alot more interesting. i love the way all of his books mesh together perfectly. all in all, Read This Book!"
1,Was this really made in 2001?,"This CD is a pretty big let-down, if you're a fan of Egil's Webster Hall CD. I picked this up based on his name, basically without looking at the tracks (oops!). This is more of a greatest-hits-of-trance-2000 disc that they really didn't need a DJ for...it could be one of those compilations where no DJ is named and it's sold on television.Along with track selection, the mixing is suspect--Egil drops ""Sandstorm"" in like a lead weight, and there isn't a whole lot of creativity in the other mixes.However, if you're a sometimes-clubber and you want to hear ""that one song I know,"" likely it's here. Anyone with more than a handful of trance CDs in their collection will already own these songs, sometimes on CDs made over 1-1/2 years ago."
3,is it really a professional book ??,I read almost 200 pages of blah blah for beginners! before starting subjects which are of interest. They should cut off the basics part and give us more information about real life problems pro programmers meet everyday...IRNBRU
4,This Book is a Classic,"I cannot believe this book would be out of print. It is a great children's classic; the story is capivating, and I loved how Stover was able to give the dolls their own personalities. I wish this book was a required book in elementary school."
2,I was disappointed with this product.,"I received this product in a bag, it was all wet in the bag, the bottle leaked all over the place. When i took it outside to use on my table saw, I followed the directions to the T and to no avail. It did not remove the surface rust. I was a little upset since the bottle cost so much. I didn't think it did what the description said it would do. Not a problem I'm sure i can find more uses for it. Oh yea and the bottle sprayer did not work well at all. I was thinking about switching bottles, but I will have to get another heavy duty bottle.Respectfully,Joe Bergeron"
1,hard as a rock,too hard and too large. not comfortable.not sure how well it works cause I didn't want to insert it all the way.disappointed.
5,High School text book replacement,Perfect shape and great price on used textbook. My son lost his high school textbook and I was quite pleased that I found it here for only $14. It was in much better condition then the one he lost and I owed the school $65 to replace.
4,"Informative, Clear & Practical","This little gem of a book should be read or taught to people living, studying or working in a multi-cultural environment. Based upon personal experience the author succinctly presents sound advice to help us understand each other. I spend a lot of time in a multi-cultural society and know that this book contains reliable information and common sense."
3,Only works on regular DVD players,"I haven't watched these yet, but they were recommended by a family member, as being very interesting. If you only have a BluRay player, then don't buy these because they won't work. They only work on a regular DVD player. This may be because they were made in Mexico."
3,class requirement,i dont know what to write here. it was a required for a class i took. sold it back soon as class was over.
1,Why?,"I cannot imagine any extra information this map can provide that cannot be obtained for FREE from the official NYC Subway Map that can be obtained at any subway station, hotel or turist office.All the features mentioned (timetables, connections points of interest) are listed there, plus the map is updated fairly frecuently for long-term service changes dur to construction."
1,Save $4 dollars for same amount of EXPO markers,"Why pay $18.83 for 16 markers when you can just pay $7.38 for 8 markers twice? Same EXPO markers, sold on Amazon, and super savers as well.http://www.amazon.com/Expo-Chisel-Markers-Colored-80678/dp/B000N342KS/ref=sr_1_43?s=office-products&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1338794605&sr;=1-43"
4,"Colors-great, quality-meh","I'm a teacher and I purchased these because I wanted my white board musings to match my classroom decor. I was kind of disappointed to have to purchase such a large package to get the ""cool"" colors. I wish this package has LESS of the standard colors available in most supply closets (black, red, blue, green) and MORE of the ""special"" colors (teal, pink, lime, orange). Some of the colors wrote very well, wile some were almost dried out out of the package. I plan to contact Expo concerning the quality."
3,hmmmmmm,I was disappointed with the customer service portion of my product because the box was missing a few of the essential contents; the powerpack 2 upgrade and the instruction manual. The actual belt itself is great to use and I can already feel my 40 something flab disappearing! I know it must look kind of strange as I am walking but vanity has no limits!
2,Sort of Helpful,"I didn't like the way this book was laid out, but there were some good tips for the Ren Faire costume maker."
4,Nice pictures. Have to get stronger glasses to read the text though.,"From what I've been able to read with a magnifying glass, this is a useful, well documented book."
4,Great Tool!,I have used this for several projects already and it has saved me a lot of time and effort. Just wished it could have come in a plastic carrying case instead of a simple canvass bag.
3,things not included,I think the saw is simple and afordable for a weekend hobbyist. My only complaint is that the saw was to come with three blades and a canvas carrying case. Of these items I recieved only one saw blade and the canvas bag was missing.
2,Don't expect Germond & Whitcover,"I was hugely disapointed by this book. The 2000 election was one of the most fascinating ever. I was looking forward to reading a great behind the scenes look at the whole process. Jack Germond & Jules Whitcover wrote books of this sort from the 1980-92 elections. I guess I was expecting a similar book. Instead, this is more the story of Dana Milbank covering the campaign. Although there were a few interesting tidbits (the fraternity jokes among Gore staffers forced to share rooms, for example) this book focuses too much on the author's views/judgements and is written from a satirical point of view rather than a historical or investigative look at the strategies that were the 2000 election. For someone who likes fluffy anecdotal impressions of the past campaign this book may be perfect. As for me, I wish Germond & Whitcover were still around writing recaps of Presidential elections."
2,"Limited functionality, died within a couple of weeks","My experience was with the 40 GB version of the HD300. Mine died within a couple of weeks, after I had used it only a dozen times. I suspect the hard drive gave up the ghost, as it froze on boot and couldn't be powered off or anything -- I had to wait for the battery to run down overnight.I found the touchpad and navigation usable but not wonderful. I liked the fact that the HD300 shows up on a computer as a USB mass storage device and songs can be transferred by drag and drop, but was disappointed to find that I still had to run an application on my computer (called MPIO utility) in order to be able to search songs on the player. I was also quite bummed to find that the HD300 has no support at all for custom playlists."
1,This thing is terrible,"I got one of these for Christmas and have spent the last few weeks trying to get it to work. There are several major flaws i'd like to point out,-The original firmware is aweful and causes the HD300 to freeze up constantly.-The instruction on how to upgrade the firmware are incorrect. You can eventually dig up the proper way on the internet, and it can be doen in just 8 or so steps involving multiple file copying and windows, but who wants to do all this?-The program that came with it is not the proper program for it, so half the functions don't work.-Once you get past all the freezing problems, and updating problems, then it has all these weird track recognition problems.-The instruction manual is completely useless and in most cases wrong. I believe they just adopted manuals and software from a different product and never really tested anything.-I pushed the reset button on mine and it doesn't even boot up anymore, I guess I have to take it back"
1,Not worth buying... F-,"WORTHLESS!!! They couldn't get the seam to be the same thickness. It is thicker so every time the seam hits your piece you are sanding it actually knocks it away from the sander. Worst sanding belt I have ever used. I have a 3"" belt sander so I normally cut a slice in the middle of a 6"" belt and tear a into 2 3"" wide pieces. That is how I have done it for 12 years. These would not tear evenly down the middle and ended up with an offset to it. Which while I was using it the edge caught on the piece I was sanding and ripped off the edge and came around and whipped my arm lacerating it quite badly. If I didn't have super glue readily available I probably would have needed stitches. I now have a 3"" scar on my arm due to these shoddy worthless belts. Not to mention that it gouged the piece I was sanding. I have thrown them away as that is the only place they belong. In the trash."
1,Very Biased,"The book was written for a ten year old to read. It was only 160 pages of large print and full page pictures. There weren't many facts but only opinions and speculation. Not much substance. There isn't much written about the actual english bulldog or why it was really bred for it to be the way it is today. The authors are constantly putting down the bulldog breed and trying to make the new recreated ""victorian bulldogge"" breed sound much better in order to sell them in England. If this new breed which they are trying to ""push"" isn't accepted by internationally famous organizations like the AKC, why again is it supposed to be a better breed? If you are a bulldog enthusiast or breeder, you will be offended by reading this book. Not recommended!"
5,WELCOME TO WHOOP WHOOP!,"I thought this movie was fantastic! It was a great comedy. I thought that the warning at the beginning of the movie about no animal being harmed during the filming of the movie was very appropriate, although no animals are hurt during the shooting of a movie. But I think the music was also fantastic all through the movie, but I think the musical score done at the end with Climb Every Mountain and When You Walk Through A Storm was fantastic.I liked the way they put new music to them two songs. I also thought the part of the funeral with the lady sitting in the chair and the funeral possesion was great as When You Walk Through A Storm played on the way to the lady's cremation was the ultimate funeral. I would recommend this to all who loves romantic and funny movies."
5,I have been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD,Please add this one to your collection. It is cheerful adn delightful. I have watched it at least 10 times and I will watch it over and over again. It makes me laugh every time. Love the Australian accent.
5,Black Comedy with a Punch,"Welcome to Woop Woop amounts to a farce with a very unique (and appalling) storyline. The town Woop Woop is literally ""off the map"" and its inhabitants interact in a surreal and disturbing fashion.Fleeing from danger in New York, the lead character (Johnathon Schaech) makes it to Australia, only to walk into a much bleaker situation - a kind of time-warp - where Daddy-O is the law, the judge, and the executioner. Rule number one: no-one escapes from Woop Woop.Unfairly criticized as vulgar and offensive, many have missed what this film is all about. Properly understood, however, this makes for highly entertaining (if somewhat foreboding) viewing. Great stuff!"
1,Wow.... because I thought it sucked.,"This movie is terrible.. no plot, (great soundtrack) bad acting, this movie is terrible... don't even see the movie, but buy the soundtrack... it features Reel Big Fish, Cake, etc... I think this movie is a complete failure and I almost fell asleep after the first 15 minutes. The characters are all obnoxious enough to drive one insane. If you want a good cult comedy, check out ""Clerks"""
2,"Downloaded for kindle fire, pictures are TINY","Nice book! Wish I could see it on the kindle fire! I think the price point should be .99 cents for a download of a book that reads about 3-4 inches across on my 9 inch screen. It's only about 10 pages total too- I think this was way too much for a book I can barely see. I am upset! The point of the kindle for us was to read to our son (we have a small apt and limited space, so a e book makes alot of sense!) but I am so disappointed to learn that not only are VERY few quality kid's books available for kindle fire, but they are often like this- teeny tiny no matter which way you turn the screen, and take up sometimes 40% of the screen. That SUCKS! I'm sure that this book is fantastic and cute in person- but when reading it 4 inches across, with all the business of the dogs and scenes, it's not great."
2,Not a good toy,"I got this for my birthday and it worked for a couple of hours, and then it stooped working. We took it back and got another one. It didn't work either. We went back and got another one and that one finally worked (it doesn't work now though!) We also bought one for our friends birthday, so that we could play laser tag with them, and it too ended up not working. We took it back and got another one, which worked then but doesn't work now. We also tried the Laser Challenge Radar Extreme (it's made by Toymax toO) and it didn't work. DON'T BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER LASER TAG PRODUCT TOYMAX MAKES!!"
1,"Yes, buy the wallpaper instead.","I would have to agree with both of my younger brothers with their opinion of the product ""Laser Challenge: Disarmed.""I own two sets of the original Laser Challenge equipment, where the lasers were actually acurate, and the challenge was actually, well, challenging. With this version of LC, you really can hit your opponent while aiming in the opposite direction, up to and beyond 100 feet. This game also DOES NOT feature a radar that tells you when you are being aimed at.Pros:You won't lose the blasterGood range on blasters25 shots per reloadCons:The blaster is connected to the vestThe disarm feature gives an unfair advantageThe vests reset during the middle of gameplayAiming in the general direction is not necessaryCan't shoot will being fired uponConclusion: this Laser Challenge derivative, while a good concept, is not worth it if your child is over 8 years of age."
4,good durable sanding belts,used 8 mo now. seam is smooth and does not produce bump when sanding. strongly recommend!stan
4,Old Look Tarot,I like the old feel and look of the cards. The illustrations are appropriate too. A friend of mine also bought the cards but was upset to find that the names of the cards are written in ... you guessed it! ... Italian. He finds it confusing but I have found it very easy to learn the cards. I'll be using mine for many years to come.
2,good effort but not worth the import price,"Years ago, I heard that she had albums out in Japan but until now haven't been able to purchase it. I was dissapointed when I finally got it though. Her voice is soft but sounds so childish and small it's obvious that it takes so little effort to sing. Even Britney Spears music has ranges that I can appreciate. If you want to buy this, wait until you can get it on sale. It's not worth US dollars."
1,JUNK ...WOULD NOT WORK RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!!,I just purchased this June 08 from Amazon. The audio is dead right out of the box!!. I spent hours with customer no service. They recommend I send it off for repair. Checking the warranty I find they want ME to pay the shipping. No way!!. This is my first and last Samsung product. I also thinkthat Amazon should go to bat and backup their customers. But we both know that wont happen. It maybe 2008 but its still buyer be ware!!
4,Works just fine,"The image on the product page is a bit confusing as it shows a variety of reflectors, white, sliver and gold and small to large. The product you get is only one 48 inch white reflector. My fault for not reading the copy more carefully. I bought this to diffuse light and fill shadows when taking portraits and doing video interviews. Its first use was to filter the direct sunlight coming through the blinds that caused shadows on my subject. It was large enough to cover most of the window and soften the light. Am looking for the larger size to be used as a background."
3,poor video quality,I was so excited to see the dvd version of this film. But I am quite disappointed mainly because the poor video quality as newly released dvd production. It has a lot of digital artifact which showed clearly on my HDTV.
5,The Peter Piper Theme at last.,"This is a good track selection of Frank Mills Songs, but the real reason to choose this one and not ""The Very Best"" is that here is the original version of The Peter Piper Theme. Good sound, original versions, Made in Canada by Capitol."
4,this has to be one of the best!!!!!!!!!,this is the type of c.d. that kinda justs finds it own way into popularity. it just gets you bang'n yo head.the only problem is :WHERE IS THE HOUSEPLANT?! BUY THIS
4,A good overview,"This is definitely an entertaining series on the founding fathers. Very well produced. The series goes into the lives of several of the early patriots and shows how events drew them together and how they were able to make it all work.While the DVD is certainly worth watching, I found myself wishing it had more hard facts. But that's a personal preference. They spent a lot of time on the personal lives but not as much on the actual historical things they did. But it's a minor complaint to be honest.I think both students and parents will learn a lot about our country through this set and perhaps - perhaps - gain a great appreciation for how truly remarkable the United States is and why we should care about the course this country is heading into."
2,Aurgh,"I suppose this production might have some value for introducing people to the Founding Fathers. It has the advantage of playing up their human side, which many people have a hard time getting in touch with. But overall, the history is superficial and at times inaccurate."
2,Lousy,"The only reason I watched this was because of the article in Fangoria Magazine. The article made this film look interesting. Well, it isn't. This was a very boring, amateurishly written and directed movie. All the actors in this movie are awful, except Faye Dunaway, who is always a joy to watch. But too much time was focused on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with ravens and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such a thick Argentinean accent, you can only understand every couple of words he says. Also on hand is Nicholas Pauls, who plays the ultra-bland love interest to Gina Phillips. The bottom line: this movie is not scary. There is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I would have given this one star, but I gave it two just because I like Faye Dunaway so much. But even she wasn't that great in this."
2,I've seen better -- I've seen worse,"I don't particularly care for movies where I have to guess what the heck is going on. I like to follow along and at least have some idea of what the lead character is up against. I thought the acting was good, the characters (Gina Phillips and Faye Dunaway) were both good in their roles, but there just wasn't enough meat in their rolls for their talents to shine."
1,Totally unbelievable,"This movie was over the top bad. Preposterous situations made all the more unbearable by the language. Hey, four letter words are part of the culture butin this movie they dominate. Cliche' followed by unreal stupidity. And the ending has to be seen to be believed, and I don't mean that as a compliment. My goodness if cops were this dumb there would be no corruption. Broad daylight, in front of cameras, torturing people beyond recognition during an arrest, then blowing him away afterword from close range. These guys weren't just begging to be caught, they were all but turning themselves in with their stupidity. But wait till the end for the maximum incomprehensibly dumb script to amaze you. Good cop/ bad cop? No. Tortured soul dumb cop/ torturing dumb cop."
1,Bootleg of Austin City Limits!!!,This is just a bootleg of Tom Waits on Austin City Limits. When I ordered it from ImportCDS it was PAL and not NTSC. It's a waste of time and money.
4,Intense,"I first heard Chimaira at Ozzfest 03 too. They absolutely do give the most incredible show, with the most crowd participation and violent pits I've ever seen. Anyways, I bought this album the day after the concert and it doesn't dissapoint. This is probably the most intense metal I have heard since Pantera's Far Beyond Driven. But unlike Far Beyond Driven, Chimaira come accross with a more polished finish that reminded me of Megadeth's Youthanasia, albeit a little light on solos. This CD is definatly worth buying if you are a fan of Metal in it's purest form. Be sure to check out ""Down Again,"" ""Pure Hatred,"" ""Power Trip,"" and the title track."
3,No what i was expecting,"good cd, but it was a little heavy for me. and that saying alot cuz i like heavy."
2,Boring...,"once again, chimaira masters mediocrity. the one thing that keeps this band from being anything more then average is their obnoxious singer. mark hunter sounds like gonzo taking a dump. a 45 minute dump. not very impressive. saying that chimaira resembles slayer is an insult to a very awesome band. slayer would pound chimaira to dust. ditch the vocals and the band would be alot better. just another nu-metal, yes, nu-metal band."
2,"Weakest In This Series, Highly Recommend 2002, 2003, 04, 05","Below average, the weakest in this series. I recommend the entire series, expept for this original 2001. This 2001 isn't that good. Purchase it if you like, but be warned, it really is significantly weak in comparison to the later CDs in this series.2002, 2003, '04, and '05 are outstanding. I own all the discs from 2001 thru 05. If they can keep this up, I'll look forward to purchasing another CD ASAP!"
5,HIGH QUALITY WORLD MUSIC AT A GIVE AWAY PRICE!!!,"I was shocked by the price of this CD and thought that this would be a bunch of recycled garbage or songs that were thrown together by some mixer just to make a CD. Contrary to my opinion, it wasn't! Palm Beats Volume 1 is an incredible compilation of world, dub, breakbeat and house music that is sure to satisfy all fans of those genre! This one will definitely be a hit for the summer and all those pool parties--and you really can't beat the price. Songs of note are from Polaris, Sidestepper and Baaba Mal! Highly recommended!"
3,Not as good as the first two books,I had trouble with this book... maybe the format is getting a bit tired? jerrilyn keeps up the jokes but somehow I could not finish it. The suspense was missing and I found I could not care less whether or not the murderer was ever tracked down. The best of the series is most definitely Immaculate Reception.
2,Killer Wedding,"The book was somewhat entertaining, but flawed by startling dangling participles, ""Climbing up my front steps, the mighty river....""Sitting at a booth at Kate Mantellini's, the table in front of me....."", and bad grammar, ""soon we were both laying on the kitchen counter..."" If publishing companies no longer edit books, perhaps they should distribute grammar books to their authors."
5,Count on Countin on Frank,"This book contains wonderful illustrations of a boy and his unforgetable dog Frank. The boy, as he's referred to in the book, uses Frank as a unit of measure. The boy also calculates fascinating and interesting facts about peas (his least favorite vegetable), humpback whales, his father and the bathtub. It inspires readers to reconsider measurement and allows them to laugh at the same time. It is a wonderful book full of intresting, if sometimes seemingly useless, facts about numbers, calculation and one amazing dog name Frank!"
3,Region error,"As a newbie to this site and buying DVDs over the Internet, it is not at all apparent that these DVDs will not work in my region of AUSTRALIA. There should be a CLEAR notification that these are region 1 only for the USA. In fact, it ought to be easy to have the software automatically issue a warning to purchasers outside the DVD region that the discs may not operate in other regions!"
1,Seriously???,"This DVD is terrible. The guy sings a few lines about how multiplication is great and then proceeds to sing, ""1x2 is 2. 2x2 is 4. 3x2 is 6..."" and on...and on...and on. The numbers have no connection to the music or rhythm so you would do just as well singing these to your kids to any music in the car. SO unimpressed."
2,Music is repetitive for each set of numbers,"The things that make Sesame Street and Schoolhouse Rock so effective is the music. Basically, the same fellow sings all the songs and they sort of sound alike so the memory factor for kids having a hard time learning the times tables isn't there.If you are looking for a DVD of flash cards then this if for you. Rock and Learn is a great series, but this one was disapointing."
4,Calvin Klein is the man!,"I always buy the original Obession for men. So I had to try this brand, because I was curious and I was right about this product. It is a great smelling colon for men. I enjoyed wearing. Thanks!"
3,1 out of 2 ain't acceptable.,"This package of ""Seven Separate Fools"" & the previously unreleased (legitimately, that is) on CD ""Around The World..."" is spoiled by poor audio mastering on the ""Seven Separate Fools"" disc - in particular, ""Black And White"" starts out with obvious tape warble, while both ""Chained"" & ""Midnight Runaway"" are faded out early. The original MCA cd release is far better. In regard to the second disc (and yes, this is a 2-disc set - there's no way both albums would fit on a single disc, considering that the live album was a 2-LP set back in 1973), it is a fair transfer of the original audio content, but nothing to get excited about."
1,Read only if you want to be depressed,Eleemosynary is dark and creepy. I love theatre of all kinds and usually can find something I like about a script. I felt it was cold and the women are ruthless towards each other. This script might make a good actting lesson but as a stage production- don't bother.
4,Play by Blessing,Excellent play from award winning playwright Lee Blessing. As I am about to take a playwiring workshop from him it was doubly interest. Good play for community theatre's or high school's.
2,You get what you pay for,"This is a very handsome watch that is offered for a very reasonable price. The build quality is excellent - this watch feels like a tank and it keeps time fairly well, although mine tended to run a little fast (a few minutes a month).However, this timepiece is made in Malaysia. And so I was not really surprised at all when my watch started to run faster and faster until it was basically worthless. It now currently runs about 20 minutes fast every hour!I am a big fan of Japanese automatics and I thought Seiko would be able to deliver. Frankly, this is something I would expect out of a fake watch but not a genuine Seiko."
3,Enjoyable movie,"This movie is a great chickflick. I purchased it for my daughter who is 16 and likes Russell Crowe.I liked it as well. Wonderful scenery of the Provence, makes you hungry for French summers and great food and wine as well as the Southern European way of life. Have fun watching Ruth :-)"
4,Moves along nicely,"For a 'romantic comedy,' i.e. - chick flick - this moves exceptionally well, thanks to director Ridley Scott, I suspect. Nice editing, good dialogue and a charming storyline. I had no idea that Russell Crowe aspires to be a rock star. See the extra music videos. Definitely watch."
3,Surprisingly sweet & enjoyable!,"Definitely a piece of fluff, but a charming film, nonetheless. It's not angst-ridden or filled with the weighty matters of the universe -- just a nice film for the times you just want something to make you smile. I enjoyed seeing Russell Crowe's light-hearted side and thought his portrayal of a London LOMBARD (Lots Of Money But A Real D***head) was pretty accurate. The female characters were all strong, independent women and I appreciated that the British, French and American stereotypes were not overblown or exaggerated. It also helped that I happen to love the region of France where most of the film takes place."
3,A sometimes successful rom com,"Russell Crowe does an unusually comedic turn in this rom com set in France, with nice performances also from Finney, Highmore, and the ladies. The script could have been stronger, especially in regard to the romance between Crowe's and Cotillard's characters and their screen time together."
4,A Real Find,"We rented this movie without knowing a thing about it, based on the cast and the story line on the DVD box. It turned out to be a wonderful discovery. This movie deals with the questions that do, or should, determine how we live our lives. Here we are able to watch as a man re-evaluates the meaning of success, and ultimately opts for contentment over competition. In the end it's hard for the viewer to argue with his choices. The story includes several eclectic characters that add to its entertainment value. As a bonus, the cinematography is outstanding. If you're into blood and guts, or feel like a movie has to produce angst to be worthwhile, you won't like this one. For everyone else, it's well worth your time."
3,The real star is the beauty of Provence,"There have been movies adapted from books that are as good as or better than the novels. (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Godfather 1 & 2, for example.) Unfortunately, A Good Year isn't one of them. The novel by Peter Mayle is so-so, but still better than the screenplay. Why couldn't the script follow the storyline as Mayle had written it? The main character, Max Skinner, is more likable in the novel. (Sort of like a Hugh Grant type of character.) Russell Crowe's Max is arrogant and obnoxious. Perhaps this mirrors Crowe's off-screen personality, which has been heavily played up in the supermarket tabloids. The movie isn't all that terrible, though. The scenery is absolutely stunning and the beautiful Marion Cotillard is sexy and very French. As a comedy, I think it isn't as funny as French Kiss. Even so, pour yourself a glass of wine and enjoy the south of France."
3,A Visual Feast!,"Having recently returned from a magnificent two weeks in the villages of Provence, my husband and I were eager to see this offering by Ridley Scott. We had modest expectations for the plot and cast, since the reviews hadn't been kind. From beginning to end we were transported back to the lush vineyards, the picturesque hillside towns & markets and the wonderful people of Provence! We'd have preferred seeing Colin Firth or Hugh Grant in the Russell Crowe role, but Marion Cotillard was dazzling. This DVD will be a treasured part of our home collection."
5,A Good Year,"I was pleased on condition of DVD also how fast it was delived to me, Good Jub!Billl Robinett"
3,Good quick read,"Songs of Distant Earth isn't the most compelling or well-written book unlike Rendezvous with Rama and 2001. However, it is a quick Sunday afternoon read. The characters are one dimensional and forgettable. I do recommend this book for its simple and elegant portrayal of the emotional and social impact of the time lag in realistic interstellar travel."
4,Always a good read,As with all Arthur C Clarke stories this was a well-written and well thought out Story that stands alone as one of the great science-fiction works of all time.
5,Great read!,Great book...A must read for any si-fi lover. One of Clarke's best. Once you start tyo read it you will have a hard time putting it down.
4,anti climatic,"This is a very good book with very interesting view points and many ideas that sound as if in few decades can actually come true (an elevator connected from the earth to a space station in space) and the characters are very interesting as well because they all have there own personlaity traits. The only real problem with the book is the ending, it's a nice one but not very descrptive as if the whole book was leading to it but ignored it at the last minute. Also, unlike other Clark novels, I could'nt find any real deeper meaning or theme that we can apply to ourselves. But it is still a very fun read."
5,Best Caribbean Beaches,This is another great dvd from the waves virtual vacation series.The producer used newer technology so the picture should be sharper than the previous Hawaiia and California waves series.Also like the others this one has nothing but ocean sounds no music or narration is included.Now you can go on a virtual vacation to the caribbean.I will write a more thural review when I watch this as I haven't got it yet.There are more coming too.Best Bahamas Beaches Coming In DecemberBest Virgin Island Beaches Coming In Late DecemberCaribbean Daydreams Coming In JanuaryFlorida Beaches with Bermuda Coming Sometimes In 2004Nature Walk Coming Sometimes In 2004Nature Walk is what it says a virtual walk in the woods with just nature sounds bird and wildlife and probebly streams and waterfalls.Best Caribbean Beaches Come out Friday Nov 21 and will probebly be here at Amazon as soon as a week.I highley recommend this as well as the other 5 listed above.
3,dvd,Beaches are beautiful but TV (not wide screen) format plus low resolution is poor. These beaches need to get a BluRay version newly done in wide screen.
5,Makes you proud to be from this great country,"It was so great to learn about heroes you can relate to. To most people, these are just ordinary folks but when you learn about their lives and acomplishements, you can't help but be proud to be from the same country. This documentary is greatly done and my only regret is that I would have like to see this movie before Bob Mathias, one of the heroes died of cancer."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,Meryl Streep can definitely act but the movie was a snooze fest. I was looking for other stuff to do to keep me occupied while it was on. Glad I rented instead of buying!
1,a sort of nixon in drag,"why can't i find this title listed in horror?(but i am forgeting. no words, no comment. there, all done.)"
4,Woman of strength,"I bought this for my Mother, the Iron Lady of our family. I'm sure she'll enjoy the historical references & Streep's acting."
3,Great acting; confusing movie,Meryl Streep does an excellent portrayal of an elderly lady fighting dementia and Jim Broadbent plays the role of her husband brilliantly. Had I expected a film about dementia I would've gotten what I expected however the balance of the film concentrates on that rather than the accomplishments and career of Margaret Thatcher.Reverse that balance and you have an excellent film to go along with the great acting.
2,"Great acting, lousy story.","Meryl Streep did an amazing job in her role, amazing performance. However, we did not like this ,movie due to the horrible writing. This could have been such a good movie about the rise of Margret Thatcher. Instead the primary focus was her going senile, most people will have problems as the age. We were disappointed that the director chose to capitalize on her aging problems instead of delivering a solid story about this historical woman, I'm glad we rented this. This is one we will never watch again. Real disappointment."
4,Interesting story,"I don't know the story of Margaret Thatcher well enough to know how accurate this movie was, but it was a very well acted slice of life. We enjoyed watching it."
1,They Are Right: One Star,"I am sorry, I really wanted to like this film. Read all of the One Star reviews and there you have it. Boring, boring, boring."
1,The Iron Lady,"The Iron Lady is the worst picture of the year! The writer, director, and Meryl Streep used their far left political views to dismiss Margret Thatcher's greatness down to an old lady who is loosing her mind to dementia. Using flash back story telling to show her rise to becoming Prime Minister of England, the story line leans left and does not give Margret Thatcher her due as a great conservative leader. I walked away from this movie disappointed. My recommendation is don't buy this movie."
2,Great Performance - Bad Flick,"I never cease to be amazed at the manner in which Meryl Streep transforms herself into a totally different human being. In this case she ""becomes"" the famed Prime Minister in manner and speech. It's a performance worth time and investment. Unfortunately the film lacks coherence. The story line is confused and the continual ""visions"" of her dead husband become tedious. The script seems incomplete and the editing is absolutely dreadful. What evolves is a character study of Ms. Thatcher rather than her life's story. Watch this only if you want to see another great performance by America's greatest actress."
1,Iron Lady,"The movie was slow and boring , no real plot to the movie , love Meryl Streep as an actor,"
2,A Lost Opportunity,"Why did they create this film about an important statesman from the point of view of her senility?The performance of Meryl Streep was very good but the part was so baffling that i do not know what it was in aid of.Also, it would be nice if the author had made clearer if the woman was just power hungry or believed in her cause. I found it quite unclear. This was one of those films where i would like to ask for my money back when it was over."
3,I barely remember watching this movie,"Amazon says I watched it, but I barely remember it. Not the best movie, there are a vast many others where Streep is worth watching."
2,For Streep fans only,"This movie focused heavily on Thatcher's mental state near the end of her life. Apparently she had some form of dementia. We only get a brief moment on the Falklands War. We get some archival footage that is accurate. Less accurate are some of the staged sections depicting attacks by Irish Nationalists/Republicans. The car MP Neave is blown up in should be blue, not red. The INLA took him out. When the Provos trashed out the hotel in Brighton where the Conservative Party was holding a meeting I thought the filmaker could have covered it better. All in all a disappointing movie from the historical angle."
1,Awful Left Wing Garbage - Great Acting,"Well if this isn't proof that Meryl Streep could retrieve a scribbled shopping list from the garbage and make it look like The Taming of the Shrew, nothing is.What terrible left wing propaganda, making one of the most iconic women of history look like a narcissistic nut case.Don't waste your $3.99 downloading the video. What a disappointment to students of history who lived in her time.Typical Left Wing Hollywood claptrap.Shame!!!"
1,Zero Stars,"Can I give a review with zero stars? This movie was extremely disappointing. Consider all that Margaret Thatcher accomplished, the change she brought to the UK (good or bad) and you have a compelling biography. Now focus on her late life dementia. This movie played as a political hack job instead of an intriguing biography."
3,Maggie Thatcher,"I thought the movie maker spent too much time on her later years in life, not the actual good she did for the country."
4,Touching,"If you have an adult parent and they are on their own, this movie really shows the situation very well.You have to really remember that Meryl is not an 80 year old. She does an amazing job."
2,Is This a Movie About Dementia or Margaret Thatcher???,"The first 25 minutes of this film is watching an old person who used to be famous, but who now has dementia. Margaret Thatcher as The Iron Lady is very interesting, but we get only tiny tastes of the famous Steep powers of impersonation of Ms. Thatcher in her heyday. However, those snippets are no substitute for a fully fledged, well acted, character biopic. Got through the first hour by fast forwarding through the confused old lady bits to the few moments that dealt with Thatcher's exciting past in politics and then gave up. It just wasn't worth it."
2,Not Much,"Meryl Streep did an outstanding performance considering the story line and production she was handed. This movie stinks, plain and simple. There was so much more they could have done with this movie. There are mountains of material and accomplishments for Margret Thatcher. Why didn't they do a lot more like ""Evita"" but without the musical. Prime Minister Thatcher was a great and accomplished lady. This movie did her such an injustice."
1,Review of Iron Lady,"This was a TERRIBLE movie! Very disappointing. I did not want to see a movie about Margaret Thatcher in her dotage. Meryl Streep did a good job of portraying her as the prime minister, but the way the movie presented things was disjointed and I thought that picturing her as a senile old lady was demeaning to the memory of her as a powerful political and historical figure."
5,Iron Lady,"From what I remember of seeing Mrs. Thatcher in the media Meryl Streep exhibited a convincing representation of her personality, passion and presence.I was hoping to getting a good reveal of her relationship with Queen Elizabeth II, but there was no mention of The Queen.The movie seemed to show that she was out of touch with the poorest people who suffered the most from the status of the economy. Mrs. Thatcher seem to expect the same show of strenth and stringent sactifice the English people had in dealing with conditions during the WWII."
2,iron lady,I think this was a very boring movie.I would not recommend it to anyone.No plot or interesting parts to the movie.
1,Terrible movie but great acting by Meryl Streep,"other than the great acting of Meryl Streep, it was not good at all. The whole movie is about prime minister disease or dementia. They could make much much better movie."
3,Great acting - too much time on her latter years.,"I think that the acting was great. Many of the scenes were difficult to follow. Too much was made of her latter years to the point that I could not follow the ""time machine"" dramatics. I am glad that Amazon had this in stock."
4,Stunning Performance by Meryl Streep,"There are a lot of reasons why this movie simply does not work. It jumps back and forth in time without providing a coherent narrative to keep us anchored in one place. It's a movie about a despicably cruel individual which tries to make her look not so. It's a movie about the British, and who really cares what happens in Britain anyway?But while there are a lot of reasons why the movie does not work there is one why it does work: Meryl Streep gives the performance of a lifetime in her portrayal of the Iron Lady. Whereas she can be extremely annoying and self-righteous when she merely plays her neurotic self (""The Hours"") she is a delight to watch as Margaret Thatcher, catching her tics and idiosyncrasies with remarkable nuance and verve."
5,Excellent Product,"I am thrilled with this shoe. I've bought one in black several times. I've been wearing this model for several years and this shoe fits right. I highly recommend brand. Also,I have been very pleased with the service from the staff and the management of this Company."
5,Really good manual,"Because of [a review I read}, I didn't buy this book at first, opting instaid to get a ""shop manual"" from another company. I wasted [money] and a lot of time. After getting this book from Amazon, I was able to fix my hydraulic system. This is a really good manual, if you have one of these fine tractors, get this book."
2,Full of Wrong Information,"Since my wife and I are new residents of Raleigh, NC, I figured this would be a great guide. It has given us some interesting facts about the Carolina and put some areas on our targets to visit. However, it is full of mis-information such as wrong Website URLs, wrong times of operation and incorrect phone numbers. Perhaps this was all valid when the book was written in 1999. I'd recommend saving your money on this book and looking for something more accurate."
3,Half and half,"When I received the shipment, I was not too happy.1) Does not come with a Seiko case2) Does not come with a Seiko warrantee3) The bracelet does not have a safety clip like a genuine Seiko, and the buckle doesn't click smoothly.4) I was charged with custom payment from the delivery.Now after wearing for a month, I feel better as I am looking for a day to day watch to wear and this one serve the purpose, as it is kind of accurate.The automatic mechanics look genuine as the back is a glass back and you can see through inside with all the Seiko logos.Although it may cost slightly higher, next time I would prefer going to a store instead!"
1,Worse than the original battery,"As with most ipod mini's, my battery began to lose its charge and was hardly effective barely an hour and a half of playtime @ the lowest volume level). The installation of this new battery went fairly smooth and I had no problem but the battery itself is horrible. I used it a few times and it worked decently but now it barely can play 2-3 songs and goes from being fully charged to dead. I would not recommend this product unless you want to try your luck, I used the previously review to make my decision and was hoping for a better solution than having to lose my ipod to a refurbished one."
4,Quote,"""Music was my first love , and it will be my last. Music of the future , and music of the past. To live without my music , would be impossible to do. 'Cause in this world of trouble , my music pulls me through"". This is from the track ""Music"" by John Miles. Kind of sums up why a lot of us are so passionate about music. Certainly applies in my case ! ""Music"" is the stand-out track , goes through lots of styling changes , lot of orchestration and tempo changes. Worth the price of the disc alone , but there are many gems on this fine recording."
4,Serious Writing--Not Erotica,"Mary Gaitskill understands compulsion well. She takes you along the fringe and down the dark alleys of sexual urgency without pandering or exploiting. These stories are not designed to titillate, although some of them may. There is nothing mechanical, cliched, or pornographic about them. They are stories about the desire for intimacy--or at least some sense of contact--and the difficulty of achieving it. Stories of passion mixed with cold calculation. Is this the ""other""? Or is this you and me? The harsh light of ""perverseness"" throws these issues into even sharper relief. A particulary fine example of this is the ironically titled story, ""A Romantic Weekend,"" which manages to be both sad and comical. Gaitskill takes a detached view of her characters, but is not pitiless. Her ability to sketch them so precisely presupposes a degree of affection, or acceptance."
5,Riveting HBO Series,"I started watching OZ only recently on HBO Canada reruns and was really getting into it but kept missing episodes as it was on either really early in the morning or really late at night. This series was actually purchased as a present for my boyfriend, but I enjoyed watching it just as much as he did. Great story lines, interesting characters. The extras on the DVD's are fun, especially the commentaries. Good value and a terrific price!"
2,Good price,"Was happy with the price and shipping speed; definitely received promptly. Unfortunately, the discs were in pretty rough shape. I was happy I'd seen the show before because a few episodes were completely unwatchable."
1,really disappointed,"I bought the dvd series and they were delivered in a timely manner as promised. i'm grateful for that. My issue is season 4 of the series has episodes on both sides of discs. I watched without any problems, then when i flipped them, my dvd player could not read it. i thought it was only that particular disc so i tried the rest (four of them) and none played. I tried to play them on my computer but to no avail. I finally attempted playing them on my laptop without any success. I emailed the company twice and i'm yet to recieve a reply. I'm extremely disappointed :-("
1,total junk,"First the warden in this prison should be fired on the spot, his prison is riddled with gang rape, drug smuggling, murder and other criminal activities he has no control. I guess if you show men on men rape(not a knouck on homosexuals, the prioners who are raping other prisoners are not really homosexuals.)murdering people with shanks, racism(black supremists and neo nazis), all kinds of disgusting acts,and bad langauge , then people consider your show art."
1,"Tell all, not some","The description is for alpha AND omega. They didnt lie, but they could have added more details and truth, wont buy again."
4,Three Dog Night Music,I brought these discs as a gift for my older brother. He is a big fan of Three Dog Night. He loved the discs. He states the sound quality is great. He listens to them several times a week. Awesome Amazon!
1,Junk,"This is a very cheaply made and unstable product. You get what you pay for. So DON'T waste your money. It will NOT work with newer operating systems such as Windows 7. Compatibility settings modifications will not help you. The 800 number listed for support is defunct. It takes you to a rebate center for another product. BUYER BEWARE. It will be installable if you still run Windows98. MAYBE. Easily scratched casing and reset button can only be reached by inserting a pin or needle as far down as you can go through, yes, a pin sized hole. How many times do you think you can do that before puncturing the mechanism? Instructions seem easy but it's what they assume you already know that confuses you. JUNK. Made in China says it all."
1,NO TECH SUPPORT,"This was purchased by an elderly man who failed to check and see what operating system it would work with. Of course, he had just purchased a WINDOWS 7. This will not work! Further, I decided, in trying to help him, to call the tech support 800 number on the package to see if there was any way the product could be formated on WINDOWS 7. The recorded message said, ""I AM SORRY. TECH SUPPORT FOR THIS PRODUCT HAS STOPPED OPERATING"".My suggestion: Buy at your own risk. Luckily, it did not cost very much money."
1,Waste of Money,"I did not have a problem installing the software as others have, but I have had problems with the actual keychain. I bought three thinking they would be great gifts. One works just fine, the other two DO NOT work. One got stuck half-way through the uploading process. I got a message telling me that the device on the USB port had malfunctioned. The screen on the third keychain has never worked. I charged it as recommended, but the screen never appeared. I called the company and they were very friendly and they are sending me replacements, but I wouldn't be surprised if the replacements don't work. I wish I would have purchased a different brand.... I wish I would have read other reviews before buying three..."
2,Great little gadget!,"I'm editing my first review as it appears my first one was defective!I had gotten the first one a few days before Christmas and it just would not work. I got the second one on Christmas and it was fine.I was able to use the same photo software that came with the Senario ornament to load the photos. It took almost 70 photos, not 50. It holds a good charge and I just love it.If you have a problem with it, I suggest returning it for a new one. It seems that some of them just have defects."
5,Easy if you don't overthink,"I got one of these and I was really pleased. I have Vista and so much is not compatible or difficult, but it worked right away.I definitely had to read the instructions, but it was pretty easy once I realized that1. pictures will show as unit is charging2. you need to have unit plugged into usb port with screen saying ""updating"" before software on PC to load photos will work.3. you need to hold down on/off for 3 seconds to turn unit back on if you have turned it off."
1,Does not turn on... and yes I hold the power button...,It's a piece of junk. I'll bet the sucees rate of this product quality control is under 50%.
4,A dichotomy of a film....,"The acting is superb, almost all the way down the line. There are some overacted/overreactive moments, but as a whole, the cast is excellent. For that matter, so is the photography and the story. The film is watchable just for that. What makes it imperfect is, it seems, a little much on the director's part to be artisitc. As a result, the film seems a touch disjointed and/or illogical in spots. IMHO, it could have been better resolved fora tighter film. Still, an excellent watch."
4,Under-recognized,"Most quality films these days are the ones that fly under the ""Hollywood Radar."" And ""Eve's Bayou"" is one of them. Wonderful ensemble cast, beautiful setting and a troubling and intriguing storyline makes this one of the best I have seen in the past decade. Debbie Morgan's performance was outstanding and Jurnee Smollet had great depth for someone so young as she was at that time. All in all, a great film."
5,great,"Ecellent movie,perfect timing. The movie was sold for an excellent price. It also arrived in perfect gift giving condition. The movie was worth every penney spent, although, I did not spend many pennies on it in the first place."
1,I couldn't take it anymore!,I've never written a review before- but this book was was boring & the ending so obvious within the first 100 pages that I just had to try to save another reader's disappointment if I could. The characters were so uninteresting- that I didn't even bother to skip to the end. I just didn't care.
3,Not a surprising twist,"Though promised a surprise ending, this surprise was easy to figure out as soon as charactors are introduced. I think a better way to advertise this book would be on the human level. I see another reviewer of this book thought there were no likable charactors. I think he/she missed something there. Because Trillipush was likable. He was passionate but hurt by the circumstances of his childhood. The real interest/mystery of the book is understanding the psychology of the main charactor as it unfolds. Why is he like this? Why does he want this find so badly? How will he handle failure? I admit at times, I became bored with this reading. Perhaps, it was too long in making its point. In the end though, I am glad to have read it."
1,The Scatologist,"Arthur Phillips' The Egyptologist is disappointing on many counts. As a mystery, it is very obvious. There is no need to read all the way to the end to find out what happened, although some after the fact additions in the form of a lost letter from a previously unused narrator do add a bit of clarity. The two major narrators describing the story and their variant perspectives on the story, which were meant to be humorous, came off as tedious and self-absorbed. I found myself skipping many pages. The Egyptology side of the story was weak, as was the description of the settings in Luxor and Cairo. Some people might find the idea of Egyptologist discovering a porn-star king and his tomb amusing, but the book could be retitled the Scatologist. I'll take Death on the Nile any day over this book."
4,Three,"Don't be afraid to take an extra leap. It makes all the difference between a ""so-so"" book and a ""wow."" I think there are three rebirths in this book. Think about it!"
1,Not engaging at all...,"I tried to read the book, but it literally put me to sleep. I don't agree with the format in which this was written, and I hope I never read a book liek it again. Im amazed at people who actually finished it."
2,Skip the Middle-buy it used,"This is the first time I've been ""compelled"" to write a review. This book had such great promise. I think it just needed a more forceful editor. Being in the head of a madman was very intriguing, but since the secret is let out too early on, the madman's head becomes merely tedious. Way too tedious way to long. If the premise and plot weren't so wonderful - I'd say don't buy it. Do get it, but get it cheap."
2,Poor book to follow,"Honestly, I found this book terrible. The whole first 80 pages is dreadful to read. The thing that is most aggravating is the organization of the book. Phillips attempts to construct his novel by various methods like diaries, letters, etc but they are just thrown out at you with no organization at all. This makes the reader work too hard to determine the facts of what is being written and just confusing. It makes it even more confusing since all the characters seem to have a blood relation, where some old characters are dead, newer relatives keep switching in and out of the story,and the setting keeps changing from past to current. It is a good common concept in letting you figure out the story but there needs to be more information and organization. There is not even chapters in the book! Book is very slow."
3,Nice but too big,"Very cute pair of shoes, however, I feel they run about 1/2 a size to a whole size bigger..."
2,Find another edition.,"I have three complaints about this edition of Tocqueville:1) Nowhere in the book is the translator credited. This violates basic principles of publication and scholarship.2) This is in fact an abridged version of the original English-language translation by Henry Reeve, dating from sometime before 1862. Unless you want to re-create the experience of a modern Frenchman confronted with de Tocqueville's somewhat archaic French by reading the text in somewhat archaic English, I would seek out any of the more recent translations: there are at least three.3) The ellipses, that is, the abridgements, have sometimes been made to conceal some of the author's less flattering views America. In fact I suspect this is a ""patriotic"" abridgement. For example, in the second chapter of part one, Heffner has omitted references to some of the excesses of Puritan law in New England which the notoriously even-handed Tocqueville had cited."
3,"Great scenery, poor script","I am a fan of the historic epic and don't expect any movie to adhere closely to reality and allow a certain artistic licence to make the movie somewhat more enjoyable.The scenery in this movie was excellent and I'd have enjoyed seeing more of it throughout the movie.The acting especially when both Temujin and his blood brother was great, but hands down the actor playing his brother stole almost every scene that had both of them on screen (the scene with Temujin refusing to beg his brother is a great one). However, I thought it was a case of great actors fighting against a torpid script. The script in my opinion was the weakest aspect of what should have been a great film, but was instead a passable movie. Pity."
3,hmmm....wondering,this film is good .............but certain junctures didnt meld............loved it tho..........im reading the book genghis khan right now.....
1,"Great movie, but poor product","For sure, I only spent $8 on this DVD (new), but I would've expected it to come in better condition. My DVD (which was listed as ""new"") came to me in a package, and I could immediately hear my disc bouncing all around inside the box. When I removed the package, I saw that my box was cracked in the back with a large gash going down the middle of the back. The DVD itself had a few scratches on the back of it (probably from being jingled inside the case so much). I am not pleased with this because I could've spent less on a USED DVD, and gotten a better quality product with less scratches.As for the movie itself, I already know it's great because I had seen it previously. I just hope my particular DVD plays in its present condition. I will never order another DVD from the people I ordered from. You've been warned."
2,Heaven's Burning,"This movie was way too visually violent for us, without a strong enough plot to justify it. Disappointing, we like most of Russell Crowe's movies. We gave it away to a Blockbuster after one viewing."
2,For die hard Crowe fans only,"This is for fans of Crowe who are interested in seeing all of his movies. Don't get your hopes up though, he really isn't in the thing THAT much, little dialogue and few close ups. The actress he is teamed up with is not good and the plot is slight. It just didn't work for me!"
3,Heaven's Burning,"Not the best movie ever made, not even the best Russell Crowe movie, but quirky and twisty. Refreshing to see a love scene with the camera on the man's face for a change."
1,movie sucked,"the other reveiws must've been done by people in the film.laugh out loud funny efx. a script that wouldve been rejected by ed wood.this movie and i use that term loosely,is horrendous on so so many levels.i cant waste any more time on this. i need a shower."
1,Oh Dear.,"Let's see: I think I'll get five community theater auditon rejects, give the fat boy a camera, throw in a few fart jokes, a 50-ish poor imitation of Pippy Longstocking, an ugly fake blonde (with even uglier boobs), and two other 50-ish ""youngsters"", really cheap EFX (the ""critter"" kinda/sorta' looked like the things from Ghostbuster), and I'll make myself a movie called... Oh. Wait. That's already been done and I've just wasted time watching it. AWFUL. Absolutely AWFUL."
4,Good basic information,"This little book is packed full of facts for the person thinking of renting a camper or motor home in Europe and touring in it for an extended period. The authors' willingness to ""name names"" and send their readers to vendors they've found to be reliable is worth the price of the book. Information about what to expect of your European neighbors and how to behave so they'll like you is good. How to shop for food and other tips are useful for those who have not ""lived off the land"" in Europe before. I would like to see this book updated -- this version is from 2007. More web site addresses and blogs would be useful as it omits cost figures (wisely, given its shelf life). I still have many unanswered questions, therefore I rate it 4 stars, not 5, but what's here is useful, practical, and well presented."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"Now if you just spend your hard earned money for this movie, isuggest you look at it in fast foward and then put it away infile 19. This is a poor example of a movie, and should havenever been made. None of the characters are interesting and theacting of the zombies is pitiful and embarrassing for any truezombie fan."
1,Zombiez is worse than Fulci's Zombi,"What a pile of shizer this was. Thank god I borrowed this from a freind of mine cause the cover looked somewhat cool. Wow ,horrible movie. Not 1 thing good in the first 15 minutes(thats all I could tolerate) . From the crappy camera work to lack of acting. No effort made in the make up dept. If this is Hip Hop horror, than they should stick to hip hop. If I could this would get -5 stars."
5,Master Berkeley Massage Table,"I am very happy with this product. It was shipped right on time. It is exactly as described and so useful to me. I am especially pleased with the function of raising it to different heights. I am a tall therapist and it goes up quite high. It is lightweight enough for me to carry around, yet very sturdy. There is plenty of padding for comfort and it also a great width for all sizes of clients."
5,Good saxo,"I live outside of the USA, On my city there is not a good ofert of cuality saxo. My wife and I investigate on the Internet and decided to take a risk. My wife is learnig alto sax and his teacher was amazing by the sound quiality at that price. This saxo is realy good value, I can not imagine a better one for the price."
3,"'The Best Of MuskLaden - Live, Volume 1' (Pioneer Entertainment) Various Artists","Hour long DVD from some of the early '70's biggest heavy-hitter's best known songs. It's been awhile now since I've seen most of these like Deep Purple - ""Highway Star"", James Gang - ""Walk Away"", Alice Cooper's ""Under My Wheels"", Free with ""Alright Now"", Nazareth - ""Morning Dew"" among several others. More than likely than most of you have seen these snippets before on Mtv's Closet Classics, VH1 Classic, etc."
5,Too funny for words!,"I loved this video!! It had subjects on there that I would have never thought of for short subjects such as the bread delivery man and Once Upon a Honeymoon, which still cracks me up!! Take it from a MST3K fan, this is a must have video!!"
2,Don't bother....stick with Volumes 1 & 2,"Of the three MST3K ""Shorts,"" this has got to be the most disappointing. Not sure if they were running out of material to use here, but just about the only one which is worthwhile and somewhat funny is ""Is this Love?"" ...unfortunately it's very brief. ""Speech-Using Your Voice"" is rather amusing too, but then the collection goes to the boring ""Out of This World"" and the selling one for Anheiser Busch, plus some other very lame ones. If there is a Volume 4, I would hope they could dreg up some better stuff than this...something on par with Volume 1 or 2, which were hilarious."
3,book in sad condition,"I loved this book and the movie when it was first issued, and I wanted a dear friend to have the pleasure of reading it; however,the book is so marred with highlighting, writing, and underlining that it is a distraction for her. I will buy a better copy soon"
1,this is crap,"this book is all about snakes, and fat people, and is disgusting and makes fun of black people."
2,"Oh, PUH-LEEZE!","Oh, puh-leeze! A kid gets horribly picked on at 5 years old then turns into an multi-lingual intellectual genius, a boxing hero, a rugby master, a classical pianist, tells the snooty prep school they're doing it all wrong so they change their methods, promotes prison reform for jailed Africans, gets somebody to start a school for African adults during apartheid, unites all South African tribes under the banner of being their white hero, has one guy do all the work to create mutliple businesses for him so he doesn't have to worry about money, has 2 guys die for him, and, oh yeah, becomes the best ""grizzly"" the copper miners have ever seen and all before he turns 20. Really? Seriously? Fiction is fiction but this goes beyond the bounds of fiction into fantasy."
4,"Good book, a little disturbing","At first I didn't think I'd like the book due to the descriptions of abuse in the beginning, but it got better and I couldn't put it down. I'm looking for the sequel. This was our local book club (Driftless Area Literary Society) selection. We talked about it for nearly two hours--unusual for us! I gave it a ""4"" because it wasn't as quite as wonderful as Gone With the Wind."
2,"A cute story, if you don't expect much","I loved the first few chapters of ""The Power of One."" Courtenay's writing was beautiful, and the story was compelling. But as the plot progressed, I became disenchanted with the novel. I was forced to suspend all disbelief and accept that Peekay, the protagonist, was both blessed and extremely talented, although at many points he lacks charm and charisma. I was simply annoyed when Courtenay suggests that all black South Africans will unite under Peekay, a young white boy who they regard as a mystical and savior-like figure. If you read simply to immerse yourself in a plot and another time and place, then you may enjoy this book. However, if you're looking for a thought-provoking, intelligent and interesting novel about South Africa, I'd recommend something by J. M. Coetzee instead."
1,Unrealistic and dull,This book is overly sentimental and maudlin. Hardly anything bad happens to the main character after the first few chapters. I REALLY wanted him to die! And now there's a sequel! NOOO!!
5,Simply Wonderful,"I won't go into detail, (because others already have) but this book is on another level. It is magical and a dream to read, I highly recommend it!"
5,brililant,"I read this book for the first time back in 1991 whereupon I actually bought the book by looking at its cover. The old cover was a beautiful sunset view of the African dessert with a giraffe.Nevertheless, the book engrossed me immidiately and within the first 20 pages it had made me laugh out loud and cry - no book has ever done that to me with such intensity before or since.One complaint I have is with the back cover of the new editions of this book. Mr. Courtenay or the publishers have changed the name of one of the most crucial characters! On the back, it mentions a friend, Hymie, when in fact his name is Morrie. I was bitterly disappointed to read Tandia to find that the tone of the book has changed, and Mr. Courtenay decided to changed Morrie's name to Hymie without so much as an explanation.Aside from that matter, the book is my all-time favourite and I have given it as a present to all my friends throughout the years."
5,"fantastic, inspirational read with a dose of history","This book is one of the best. It tells the story of overcoming adversity on many levels. Sadly neither the sequel (Tandia) nor the movie (same name) reached the same heights. Still a wonderful story, great images and a clever ending."
5,"A Great Book About Life, History and People","The Power of One is a special book that it is one I can not forget. It is about struggle, life, people, and history. Although the ending left me wanting more, I highly recommend people to spend a few days on the beach and read this wonderful story. As someone who recently traveled throughout Southern Africa, it provided interesting insight into South Africa and its political history. I am currently reading ""Tandia"" which may be shipped from Australian or English Bookstores to the US.PS: The movie ain't nothing like the book so don't even try and compare."
5,A fantastic game for the NUON technology,"It's fast and furious, any only the best gamers will master it.The fastest action I've ever seen, all in 1 screen.HINT: try the password GLAS - levels are not always harder in higher numbers, so try a few areas."
4,AH the sea and it's sailing life,I love learning about the ships of old and what life was like as these brave me took on the adventures that come with the sea. You will too!
1,I took away 4 stays after it collapsed on me.........,"I was on this thing with nail gun in hand and one of the casters broke and it sent me to the ground.......do you see a theme here? Read previous review on the one sold directly from Amazon. I did not exceed the weight rating.....the wheels were not locked......and the floor I was rolling it on was clean, it just snapped at the stem while I was trying to move it. I contacted Buffalo for a replacement but Buffalo said since could I not find the receipt that's not going to happen. They offered me ""replacement"" casters for $55, no other comment like ""Sorry to hear that happened"" or ""I hope you weren't hurt"", they just want more of my money for an inferior product. I think there is a design flaw and they don't want to admit it. Maybe they redesigned the casters but if not stay off of these!"
4,"Lovely, despite inaccuracies","Love Romy, love the romanticised story (which took an awful lot of liberties though with chronology, etc), costumes, and scenery. And having been made in the 1950's, unfortunately the Hungarian coronation scenes could not be filmed on the actual site in Budapest. Was a bit surprised that after that comic Police Captain was promoted to Major, costuming didn't update his rank insignia - but then I'm a nitpicker."
4,Mouse Hunt,"This MouseMan is a great little mouse for your laptop. It's attractive and small enough to use it below the keys. It also comes with a little bag so that storing it is easy and doesn't lead to knotted cables. The only problem that I've had with this mouse is the software it came with, hence the 4 stars. It doesn't allow for the full use of the mouse as I would like to use it (clicking down on the roll ball to take me backwards on websites). And downloading the software from the logitech site offers the same thing."
1,TERRIBLE..,They didn't give me mouse and never accept my request of refund!!It have passed over 1 month since I ordered.Terrible attitude!DON'T BYU ANYTHING from him.
1,very disapointed,"the concert was dull, uninspired, and not worth the money. if youdream of sean jean luc in concert thinking it will be a good eveningsentertainment, you will be disapointed. weak, weak, weak. wishthey had a concert when he wasn't old and still had some chops.Very disapaointed."
1,"Sucks, basically.","You can try all you want to pretend the Family Guy is'nt a sad, low-brow ripoff of the Simpson's but you'd be living in denial. It speaks volumes about a show when, by far, the most interesting character is the familiy dog. You might laugh here and there in between the celebrity cheap-shots and painfully typical movie parodies but I would'nt hold my breath. It's no mystery why this show was cancelled nor is it a shame. Bottom line: the Family Guy is to the Simpson's, as Schlitz is to Dom Perignon."
1,WORST SHOW EVER,"Family Guy is a retarded show, plain and simple. There's a reason it's cancelled. It tries so hard to be funny, and succeeds *maybe* 10% of the time. The rest is just unfunny and forced. It's low-rent humor aimed at people that think they're smart but really have no idea what ""funny"" is. A Simpsons ripoff that is slightly funnier than cancer mixed with AIDS, and nothing else. If you wish to be part of the mental lowest-common-denominator, waste your money on this garbage. Better yet, send your money to me."
4,"i love family guy, american dad, cleveland. love them",i like that u get 4 disc and they are packaged better than the first season
5,FAMILY GUY SEASON 3,"COULD THIS SEASON POSSIBLY BE FUNNIER THAN THE 1ST? AFTER THE 2ND SEASON, I THOUGHT FG HAD REACHED IT'S CLIMAX, BUT THE 3RD SEASON HAS KICKED MY ASS. I CAN'T GET OVER IT. MY FRIENDS ALL THINK I'M SUCH A SPAZ."
2,Almost Instantly Forgetable!,"Boring! Cliche, trite, what else can I say. It baffles me how this book got into print. The main character is one dimensional. The plot is weak with obvious red herrings. Watch out! You'll be dropping this one off at the used bookstore pronto!"
3,Boorig,"Probably has some good info, but written in a booring style and I mosty fell when reading it. I finally stuck tis book somewhere and will robably never go back to it. A lot of information which is contained in other books."
3,Eh.,"I wasn't very happy with this DVD. I don't feel like it has enough repetition in each workout to really get a good burn going. If you have never done pilates before or you haven't had much stength training this would be a good starter DVD. But, if you already workout and do strength training, like I do, it is too easy and a little boring.I like the instructor though. I thought she gave lots of good advice on posture, breathing, etc. If this DVD was twice as long and there was more repetition I would give it 5 stars"
2,Basically a cover-up,"This appeared a century ago at a time when there was zero sympathy and understanding for homosexuality, and the author, who was the executor of the Symonds estate, shamelessly covered up the truth about Symonds, even going so far as to destroy material. More recent books on Symonds have broken the conspiracy of silence, thus reducing the value of the Brown book to nothing."
1,A disgrace to philosophy,"Setting all the overt and outdated racism aside, this book is an absolutely disgrace to Nietzsche. The author doesn't understand Nietzsche's extensions to nihilism and postmodernism. Not only did Nietzsche mean absolutely nothing towards any race issues (It's meaningless to an existentialist such as himself) but he also would have deconstructed the very concept of ""race"" (which so-called Aryan Intellectuals should be open to, e.g. poststructural thought).The book is a waste of time."
2,The right tool for the right job... doorstop.,"Forget the fact that it is dull and philosophically bankrupt, this weighty tome doesn't even get its conspiracy theories correct.Still, this is not a book to be lightly tossed aside. You should fling this buffalo chip as far away as physically possible."
2,I really wanted to like this book.,"I really wanted to like this one because King's Mary Russell books are so extraordinarily good. This first Kate Martinelli book introduces several interesting characters. But it didn't hold my interest at all. I guess I just didn't care about the characters -- I was never totally drawn in. I kept setting the book down and picking up a different one. The climax was intense and exciting, as King's always are, but then there's a lengthy epilogue that made me want to fast-forward through it. I DID finally finish it, but the book was just too long. One of the hardest jobs of a writer is knowing what to leave out, and one of the hardest jobs of an editor is telling the writer that. I can't recommend the book unless you're a die-hard Laurie King fan. But DO pick up ""The Beekeeper's Apprentice."" That's one of the best of the genre."
3,Star Trek Next Generation,"Most of what other reviewers said is right. Just never drop it on a hard floor. Plus, I can read my Serial number.It seems to be for large hands, left or right. It is a first step toward a good product. The next generation needs a no-tools battery door or a drop-in battery charger and true 50-foot range. Mine dies at 8 feet away.The Phaser's internal antenna is not omnidirectional. If you point it at 4 or 8 o'clock with respect to the receiver, it will not work.I like it anyway."
3,Great Mouse for the price!,"For someone who is in the market for a gyration air mouse - this is a fantastic second choice, or First! (This one costs a lot less) The mouse is very comfortable the way it form fits to your hand. I actually like it better than ""Air"" mice. The roller ball is much more appealling than waiving your arm in the air. There are three minor improvments that can be made: It is not as solid as gyration and feels like a cheap plastic toy at first. You have to punch the little, tiny, miniscule connect button on the bottom each and every time you use it. Also, you cannot optionally use it on a surface. In your lap, standing up, but cannot be used as a traditional mouse."
4,jim got robbed on this one,"Jim Carrey should have gotten at least nominated for an Oscar for this part. He was excellent in protraying Andy a very troubled comedian. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes great acting, past SNL fans or people that are interested in character studies of ""famous"" people."
3,Carrey gives a Phenomenal Performance.,"Jim Carrey has come a LONG way from the Ace Ventura days. After watching this movie, I was upset that he wasn't nominated for a Oscar. Detailing Kaufman's life from the childhood to his battle with cancer, he never hit a false note. Courtney Love was also excellent as his ladylove. Man on the Moon didn't shy away from making Kaufman seem like a total jerk-his behavior was boorish and possibly mentally disturbed, but I didn't find out anything about the man-why he acted like he did, what made him tick, etc.Still, now I know that Carrey can do both drama and comedy equally well. I can't wait for The Majestic to come out now."
1,A Truly Awful Movie,"Although I have been a fan of Andy Kaufman for years, this awful, boring movie could change my mind. Andy is portrayed, perhaps accurately, perhaps not, as an obnoxious self-centered boor. If that is truly who Andy was then, I suppose, Jim Carrey did an excellent job of portraying him. Having said that, I must state that I was very disappointed with the content of the movie. I expected it to be a celebration of Andy's life and it was anything but that. If I had seen this movie in a theatre I would have demanded my money back. If I had purchased this DVD I would have returned it. What a waste of two hours. A truly awful movie."
3,"A character study, not a comedy","I didn't get the jokes, and I didn't like the story but I enjoyed this movie. Jim Carrey displays his acting talents, in addition to his rubberface and impressionistic ability. An excellent performance, and worth watching just to see an in depth character study of Kaufman. I finished the movie wanting to see more and learn more about the characters. Unfortunately those that expect an easy comedy will be disappointed, I would recommend seeing the film to those who are curious about what drove Kaufman, what was he really like. But don't expect any answers."
3,Comedy or Drama?,"I wasn't fimiliar with Andy Kaufman's work until I watched the Comedy Central autobiography about him. Kaufman was a unique entertainer who often confused his audience with bizarre skits and his outlandish behaviour, people loved him or hated him. The movie takes you from Kaufman's early days struggling as a comic to the end when he dies from cancer. I thought the movie was average, I didn't get too know who was the real Andy Kaufman. The movie is basically about the highlights in his career and not much else. Jim Carrey deeply immersed himself into the role of Kaufman and his alter-ego Tony Clifton. His performance was truely convincing. I would rent this movie...."
1,Add me to the list of dissatisfied D2 users,"Purchased my 500gB drive 11/8/2005. Failed yesterday. Called LaCie. Jeremy at LaCie tech support was little help, other than to tell that it may be the power block, and to try buying one to see if that's the deal. After opening up the case, enclosed are 2 Maxtor 6L25ORO 250gB drives. After some limited testing, they both appear good, which points to the bridge card. Crapola. Thanks, LaCie.I will say that I own 4 Porsche 250gB externals, and they've been no problem at all."
2,90% chance to recover data from your dead LaCie,"This drive is easy to use, but has high failure rate. We use about 40 LaCie Firewire drives year round and have about 10% failure rate. We recovered 100% data from more than 90% of the ""dead"" drives. It doesn't make any sense if LaCie told you that they can't recover the data. Let us know if you need help to recover your data."
5,Great Fun!,If you fancy a good laugh and are thinking of the perfect Christmas present for the In-Law's then this will definitely do the trick! A fantastic breakout performance from the beautiful Kirsten Lea...
5,Great from start to finish,"I bought this and listened through it once and thought it was just ""okay."" However, after listening more I think I was out of my mind not to realize the first second I heard this voice that it was something special. I am familiar with all the pieces on the disc and can say her versions stand up with the best. I would highly suggest getting this disc."
2,Bent,"These reels had been in storage too long. They are the original old disks, apparently. They were bent, so they would not turn in the viewer very well."
1,Another skipped scene,I too had the same problem described by other reviewers. It is unfortunate because this version of A Christmas Carol is the closest I have found to the actual book.
3,Great Product but terrible shipping,I love the Fiesta Dinnerware and the color is beautiful but I had to send this back twice because it kept coming poorly packaged and the dinner plate was broken.
3,fiesta ware,"I have many place setting of fiesta ware, this was a gift from my husband, and I like the color, but the cup was broken when we opened it."
3,good but...,its a good book and we love dr seuss at our house but ours came bent. i dont know whose fault it is but i just want to let you know it is possible if it would bother you.
3,Doesn't fit Chevy I5,"I bought this for my 06 Colorado with a 3.5 liter I5. Amazon said it would fit, but it doesn't. It's for older engines."
5,Enjoy,"This is my second CD, i love them, top grade CD music at its best, and you will jam the whole time your Old School in playing"
3,***1/2,"There is a lot of good to be said about a concise single-disc compilation which draws from B.B. King's entire career. But this 12-track disc is rather skimpy, and while selections like ""3 O'Clock Blues"", ""How Blue Can You Get"" and the cross-over hit ""The Thrill Is Gone"" are excellent, the inclusion of the mediocre Robert Cray/B.B. King-duet ""Playing With My Friends"" and a couple of good but not great covers is a mistake.Casual listeners will get a pretty good idea of what B.B. King is about from this collection, but the many available compilations focusing on specific eras of his work give a much better idea of his scope and depth."
3,Skimpy,"I love my Spode and waited a long time to spring for salad plates for my collection. I was disappointed in how small they are. Everything else about them is up to snuff but they should be larger. I'd call these a bread and butter plate, not a salad."
3,A good concept not quite achieved,"The concept of this book is a great one: thinking about how the right doors, windows, porch, etc. all fit together to form a quality house. However, I feel Wedlick missed the mark slightly. There were several inspiring photos and I did come away with a few ideas for my home design. But too many of the featured houses were not well-balanced, attractive homes to my sense of style. And I felt the text didn't go far enough in explaining his points. I find Sarah Susanka's ""Not So Big House"" series of books better resources for this concept."
2,shofar synthetic,"I didn>t like the look and tothis day have not been able to play it at all.So for me it was a waste of money,I will never buy another synthetic shofar again"
3,"Good Product, Slow Delivery","This product is a standard item that can be purchased at any pet store. The price for this item on Amazon was very good, compared to retail. The problem was delivery time. I am used to receiving my purchases from Amazon in two days. This common item took approximately three weeks for delivery. I will not purchase from this vendor (not Amazon) again."
4,Bohemian Ink Review,"Forrest weaves a beautiful tapestry of characters in this continuation of Tomas the Rhymer's story. It is the year 878 AD, and Moira, Queen of the Welsh Elves, is pregnant with twins Tomas fathered. In Elfland, some speculate that Moira carries the children of a much disputed prophecy. Division over the prophecy spurs the leaders of the Nine Realms into a violent struggle for power. The Elf Lords Rhys and Finvara lead the resistance that would eliminate the unborn children and the children's claim to power in Elfland. Also-unknown to all others-the demi-god Loki watches and waits preparing plans of his own.In addition to the wonderful cast of returning characters, 'The Elves Prophecy' presents an enigmatic Lord of the Air named Nissyen, and two deliciously hateful antagonists: Daniel the Priest and Isolde the dusky Queen of the Sidhe. Despite a slow start cluttered by description, Forrest builds 'The Elves Prophecy' to a raging climax that is sure to both surprise and please."
3,old recordings,"Technical side ( i.e. sound quality) of the product was not very good due, possibly, to on site technologies at recording time. But when it comes to Del Monaco and Callas what you get is still priceless and, to quote an a propos expression, music to one's ears !"
3,Valley of the moon,"I will tell you about a Daer America book inthis reviwe. It is called valley of the moon . the name of person who wrote this book is Sherry Garland. This book is not that long it has 218 pages this book ishistorial fiction the setting of this story is on a farm and lots of other places. Maria's mother died of smallpoxs and someone found her.Maria is a servant os she is not supposde ti know how to read or write.Thre are 3 rasons Ilike this book . I like Dear America books. Maria is a good person to read about , and the book is not that long. Valley of the moon is the best book I read this year. You should look for it in a book store ."
1,This was a disaster!,"After following the installation directions, the mouse would not respond and I could not override it with the keyboard, so my computer was frozen and completely down. The product is not identified on the box or manual but there is a support e-mail number listed on the box which I immediately wrote to from another computer, but I never received a reply. I was finally able to re-install my original mouse (you had to uninstall the mouse to install the wireless one) and get my computer going again. If Ihadn't been able to do this, I would have had to use my recovery CD and entirely re-install all the original programs and lose new programs and data. This was very scary time for me. I'm staying with my conventional mouse and keyboard!!!"
3,Moderately Amusing to Cleverly Laid Out,"If you are a Mason or a well versed, intelligent individual who has studied the craft, you will not learn much here. Most of the people being interviewed are partially to extremely biased, being either Masons or non-Masons. True Historical research is missing here.Don't get me wrong though, it is amusing and the production team did do a great job of walking the tight rope between conspiracy and history, mystery and fact but the truth is, their isn't much information one couldn't just conclude going on here.If you need Masonry 101, read a book by Manly P. Hall or contact your local Lodge. They will be more than happy to speak with you. That is, in real terms, with real people and not in front of a movie camera!~"
2,Run of the mill,"This is your avereage run of the mill dvd on all the conspiracy angled European Freemasonic lore. Nothing new here. I found it funny and odd that they would have A Prince Hall Mason say he was (so) but never had a word of dialogue about the Prince Hall Masons. Their mention of ancient Egypt was almost apologetic but in no way in depth. I would give it a 1 star but they did have a couple of woman Masons that had some what of an opinion.They mentioned Napoleon was a Mason but didn't give any background on him, I was waiting thoughout for that. They seemed to concentrate on a side lodge p2 & it's conspiracy linked to the Pope's death in Italy.People are so hungry these days for Masonic info I guess this will do well in units sold."
4,Basic geometrical optics--for the most part,"Sears goes through such standard topics as refraction, Snell's Law, thin lenses, aberrations, compound lenses, the eye, compound microscopes, refracting telescopes, rangefinders, polarization, retardation plates, diffraction, and the Raleigh limit of resolution. All of these topics are addressed in the first 281 pages of the book without using calculus, so most of this book is accessible even to high school students. Pages 281-321 address elementary topics in modern physics such as the Bohr atom, and Planck's radiation law and black body radiation--though only the final few pages of this section use calculus. Pages 322-349 on photometry and flux emitted by an extended source use calculus. The final chapter, pp.350-369 addresses the topic of color, again without using calculus."
5,"She captures the essence of ""cat""...",You will love this delightful book by Margy Ohring! I laughed and cried and fell in love with her cats. A perfect gift for every cat lover you know.
1,"""perfect"" form but no soul","I'm sorry; this is boring. Not very interesting for pianists to listen to... Andsnes has this cold, polished and impersonal style. His playing is predictable and when a phrase is repeated it sounds just the same. It seems like he doesn't care what he is playing. The most important thing is to show off this utterly ""perfect"" form - this musical emperor's new clothes. Nice and streamlined playing has little to do with great performance. I would prefer listening to Vladimir Horowitz, Grigory Sokolov or Martha Argerich. The Norwegian pianst Einar Steen Nokleberg is a much better interpreter of Grieg."
5,One great space opera always leads to another...,"This book truly is a great space opera and is a very far-reaching tale of human courage against a more powerful alien force, especially so when it is learned that thousands of humans are kept as slaves on their distant world. Another really good space opera is ""Advent of the Corps""."
1,c,"No good, the thing just slips around inside the shoe. They say if you cant feel it than its doing the job. Oh I felt it, was like having another foot in my shoe plus mine."
4,"A great comfort for long rides, lousy cover and straps","The cushion works great. My only complaint is that the provided cover and straps are really wimpy and break easily. I tore the strap attaching loop off the cover on my first dismount. Now all four have torn off and I have a hole in the fabric. There is a warranty that includes the cover and I intend to use it. I wish they offered a much tougher cover and strap assembly. But the pad is really comfortable and when properly inflated ( about 1 breath) it raises me about 1""off the seat."
5,This book is helpful,This book is helpful for terminology that follows thinking critically but I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone. If you don't know what critical thinking is this book would be for you. But for the average person who knows what it is and how to do so; unless you want to learn the terms and figure out how to write your arguments; then I wouldn't recommend the book.
3,Could be worse.,"I'm not too pleased with the book by itself. I have, however had much worse books, so it's alright. Thankfully the teacher of the class that I need this book for is absolutely excellent, so together it makes the class good. The author is good at explaining some of the stuff in the book and really bad at explanations for other things in the book. This is Philosophy though, so there never really is a right answer, but there are always wrong answers."
3,I miss the metal pans,"Like many others, I miss the metal pans that used to ship with the Midwest crates. The ABS plastic pans save some weight for crates that are used for travel, but they are nowhere near as durable as the metal pans, particularly if you have large dogs. The ABS pans will last somewhat longer if you use the cardboard from the shipping carton as a pad under the pan."
1,Terrible!,"Don't let the description on these plastic crate pans fool you. ""Years of use"" and ""durable"" These pans crack and break within weeks of use. The manufacturers have gotten cheap and don't want to make the metal crate pans anymore. It's as simple as that. If you can find one, get a metal pan. Plus lots of dogs hate the slick, flimsy feel of these plastic pans. It will actually make them hate going into their crate! Avoid these at all costs."
1,Disappointed,"I thought I was the only one having trouble with the crate pans. I have a Golden retriever and have the crate only six months and the crate pan totally broke apart. I cannot find a replacement for it. I have one on order from J-B Wholesale but after reading the other review, I am going to cancel my order. I don't know what to do for my puppy now?I truly am disappointed with the product."
5,THEIR BEST LIVE ALBUM NOT ON CD.,"WISHBONE ASH HAVE MANY MANY CD'S OUT BUT NOT THIS ALBUM. WHY?? TO ME THEIR BEST LIVE ALBUM IF NOT THEIR BEST PERIOD. LIKE THE TITLE READS,HOT ASH. TAKEN FROM DIFFERENT CONCERTS 1977-1980. WHAT A SHAME IT'S NEVER BEEN ON CD."
1,babes in toyland,THERE IS NOTHING OF THE SANDPIPERS HERE. THEY MADE THIS CD JUST TO SELL IT. IT IS JUST A NARRATIVE. THIS IS SALE TOOL ONLY AND NOT REAL SANDPIPERS MUSIC. DISAPOINTING WHAT THEY DO IN ORDER TO SELL THIS.
3,Decent reference book,"This book is informative but a tad boring to me. After reading through it once, I've not gone back to it."
4,Excelent for the price paid!,"This thermometer has performed excelent... but I guess it uses a lot of batteries (6 in total).Easy to assemble, I don't know why it has screwdrivers in the transmitter but has not been a problem to me.What I really liked is the alarm setting and I have perfect signal reception inside the house. The probe is large enough to be used in thick meats.Other think I don't understand is why the power button is a slider in the receiver and a push button in the transmitter... but again, it is not a big deal.I thinks this is an excellent basic thermometer that is worth its price..... and it was an automated Amazon offering..."
3,It works as advertised but you have to stay close,It works as advertised but not more then 50 feet away before it fades out
2,Van Morrison,"To those who are disappointed about some songs not being the same as what was on the show, I too was saddened to find out that Van's opening song in this series named Rambler's Blues is not available on the cd. I belive that the session shown was done by Mike Frigas? Ane the session was done at the Abbey Road Studios which is called the Abbey Road Sessions. It may be released later but niot as part of Martin's special. Luckily I held off ordering any of the cd'sI will attempt to contact Mike to see if that session will be released, only part was shown during the red, white and blues episode, there was more information in the interview after the initial show, I taped it and watched it, so I'll be waiting to see if that session is releaded."
1,Fooled.,"I was UNABLE to watch the copy I ordered here since there are around 20,000 SCRATCHES on it!"
2,1.3 MEGAPIXELS IS VERY MISLEADING...BEWARE!!!,"This item is advertised as 1.3 MP. Very misleading. When you measure pixels the TRUE measurement is the CMOS sensor resolution. For this camera, the CMOS sensor resolution is ONLY .35 MP. Yes, that is right -- .35 --. The 1.3 MP this camera markets on the outside of the box is INTERPOLATED pixelization -- this is an algorithimic method of ""blowing up"" or ""magnifying"" the image -- often making the image look very pixelated. For a small pocket sized inexpensive digital camera with TRUE CMOS sensor resolution, look to the Aiptek PenCam SD 1.3-Megapixel Digital Camera. This is actually cheaper priced, allows you to take video, and has a memory expansion slot. By the way, if your batteries run out, you can replace them -- unlike with the Logitech which comes with rechargeables BUILT IN -- guess you have to throw the camera away when it stops holding a charge?!"
1,Poor poor little camara,"The Logitech Pocket Digital has very bad picture quality even for a 1.3 megapixeldigital camara. The pictures that I took in very bright light turned out ok, but if there was any shade around it would not turn out worth crab. Don't buy this camara unless you plan on carrying a spotlight around."
5,This CD is dynamite!!,"Vivica Genaux did a beautiful job on this recording! The Rossini selection are the best, and the rest is pretty good!She should do some arias by Handel. Anyway, she sings like an angel! It's unbeliveably fantastic! Way to go, Vivica!! I salute you!!"
1,The butcher should be shot!,"I originally saw this movie when it was first introduced as a TV mini series and loved it. I was extremely disappointed when I watched this video and saw how much had been deleted, or rather, I should say, ""butchered""! As a direct result of the editing, the storyline lurches instead of flows from scene to scene. The plot makes very little sense and is extremely difficult to follow. I cannot, in good heart, recommend this version to anyone, which is sad since the original mini series was very well done. Boo-hiss to the buther!"
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed to find out that there were a lot of scenes deleted from this movie. I was so looking forward to watching this great movie. Wished this information would have been included in the description of movie/DVD before I purchased it.
2,Make sure to recheck your order before submitting online,Was not happy with this. I ordered the movie in english and received it in Chinese.
2,"Sorry, folks, I must disagree","I'll make this brief. After all the hype, I was sorely disappointed in this book. Instead of living up to the review in the L.A. Times, it reads more like a dry biography as opposed to a novel. I found it poorly written, badly translated, and repetitious, making it melodramatic in the use of exclamation points, underlines, and phrases used again and again, not to mention entire paragraphs restated again and again. Oh no, here I go, repeating myself. I must have caught the bug!"
4,Shakespeare quotes,I bought several of these books for English teachers at the high school where I work. They found it beneficial.
5,An Eye for a Dog: Illustrated Guide to Judging Purebred Dogs,Robert Cole is a renowned exponent of the art of dog judging and his ability to communicate is excellent. A most useful guide.
3,No Card with Western Digital,"Be very wary of various reviews stating a card comes with 160, 200 or 250 gig Western Digital drives. Unless your computer is high end and made after mid 2003 you will need to purchase a $30 card.Western digital stopped including cards in units manufactuered after early October 2003, and did not change product numbers. So you will see reviews stating...""worked perfect with included card"" etc. Problem is you get no card now.Good drive but you will probably have to put your machine back together, order a card and spend $35 with shipping and wait or hike down to circuit city etc and buy a card.just be wary of this."
3,Worked great with Win98 not so well with XP,"I used this mouse for most of a year with Windows 98 and it was great. I tried to use it with Windows XP Pro, but every now and then it would have problems. It would freeze the keyboard and mouse for a fraction of a second, which is really annoying when you are trying to click on something. Installing the latest software did nothing and emailing tech support yielded no useful result. I ended up putting it on another computer and using an old-fashioned corded mouse on the Windows XP computer."
2,Logitech don't honor their rebates,The mouse works great BUT Logitech don't honor their rebates. I may have to go to the BBB to get it resolved. This will be the last Logitech ideam I buy.
2,Not Optical,"Logitec's wireless system is very good, but i just can't stand the trackball.I would suggest purchacing Logitec's optical version of this mouse (exactly the same thing but it is optical, and you can't get it at target)"
4,hockey stories,"interesting stories and fun to read. a little strange to have mario on the front cover, and gretzky on the back cover, yet no story from either of them. :o("
3,"Nice item, but shipping was a killer","I purchased this item for my daughter. The price was average, but the shipping costs made the total sale overly expensive. Since the belt was coming directly from Fossil, Amazon's Super Saver Shipping did not apply.As for the belt, I was disappointed that the eyelets did not go around the entire length of the item. The original picture was different than the one showing on the review page. However, in the end, my daughter does like the belt."
2,Typos!,"This book suffers from excessive typos, like Johnson's ""Modern Times"" book. This book manages to misspell Walter Raleigh's name and Pierpont Morgan's name in the table of contents, and more follows. Harper Collins really needs to proof the books that they scan and digitize, particularly since books like Johnson's cost more than most ebooks. Another minor quibble: the publisher used the same cheesy clipart cover for this book as they did for ""Modern Times."" A bit more rigor is due this otherwise well-written book."
3,Thorough but Biased,"It took me 5 months to complete this book. Actually, it was an monumental task for Mr. Johnson and for the most part, very interesting and informative. However, I was extremely disappointed to read where he blamed most of our country's problems (from the early '60's to now) on Democrats and Liberals. His title should of been ""A Conservative Viewpoint of America's History."" He even managed to call Nixon's Watergate scandal an Eastern Media witchhunt totally excusing the ex-President of wrongdoing. This isn't the approach of a historian."
5,Wonderful Book I Bought Twice,"I originally bought this book on Kindle. After reading it about one quarter of the way through, I found that I really want it for reference material. I love my Kindle, but find it just a bit cumbersome for my use as a reference tool, so I purchased History of the American People in hard copy. Now I can pick it up anytime and using the index I can easily find what I want to review. I refer friends and family to this book quite often. I love it! The material is presented in a straightforward manor and I find it to be accurate. I highly recommend this great book."
4,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful book with some fantastic Christmas designs. My one criticism is that there are no black and white patterns, and the colour ones are very difficult to follow, particularly at night. I solved this problem for myself by recreating the pattern using my computer cross stitch software. Very time consuming, but a black and white print was much easier to read. I was also able to tape the pages together for continuity."
3,"Smelly plastic, but good protection","We bought this Club to replace a 10 year old model where the lock cylinder had popped out. This new kind has an ordinary-looking flat key, whereas the old Club had a unique, round brass-looking key that conveyed a higher degree of security and innovation. The new key seems thin and cheaply made, and I hope it doesn't break off in the lock one day.The plastic has a very strong smell, at least when used here in Arizona's hot summer temperatures. Hopefully those odors will go away soon.There was some resistance getting it to open and close one day, but hopefully that was just a one-time fluke. Otherwise I'll have to get out the WD40 which id disappointing on a product less than a month old.Bottom line is that I would have liked to see a little more attention to detail on this ""Rolls Royce"" steering wheel theft protection product. Doesn't seem product innovation has brought much good to the Club during the past 10 years."
1,Poor ending to an over connived plot.,Character were not too believable. The family was almost completely crazy. You can spot a bad ending by the huge amount of explaining done in the final two chapters. Waste of Tim to read.
1,I had a lot of problems,"I had many problems with this product, unhappyly I found that he would be much more of what the product that I received. I had that to the same return to two times product for the same problem."
2,Too Small - Bad Dimensions,"I have a notebook with a 15"" screen. The notebook dimensions are 14""x10.5"". So this product seemed to fit based upon dimensions on the web page. But the actual product is 11.8""x9"" so it was much too small. Need to find a bigger cooling pad."
1,Unusable on your lap,"This product has a sharp back edge that makes it essentially unusable if you actually use your laptop on your lap. The exposed wires simply compound this problem. If you are using it on a desk, and have no front controls, go ahead, otherwise steer clear."
4,"Better than most, but still not effective enough","The cooler doesnt cool off as effectively as I expected after reading the reviews - I'm trying to cool down the overheating GPU and it brings the temperature down by approximately 10F when fans are set to maximum speed. Additonally, if you have a docking station for your notebook like me - connecting and using this cooler could be tricky business, as DC power and USB ports are on the back, where docking station is located and you'll also have to find a way to raise the dockig station about 2 inches, in order to allow the notebook to be at the same hight as the cooler, which is the only way it can be hooked up."
2,Do not buy this,I over paid for this item! Cheap plastic! fans do not put out much air my lap top slides around on it.This is a do not buy item!!
3,fan,fits nicely in laptop case with laptopstrong dual fan systemseems to be made of fairly thin plastic so worried it won't last but we shall see
1,The wire connecting with the fan comes off easily,there are 2 wires that connect the power source (usb) to the fan and they come off easily..
4,does it's job,"It's very light weight, although it isn't really for on-lap use. The power switch is a handy feature, and USB power is easy to use.l"
3,Alright buy,"It does it's job somewhat, it's quite small and rather flimsy I feel if I drop it it would break, but it does keep my computer cooler to an extent. It is really quiet."
2,cheap plastic fan to cool your laptop.,"just as the above suggests. cheap plastic. if your laptop is heavy, the thing might bend on you and if you drop it from a mere height of a foot, you might break or crack it. it takes up your valuable usb port and isn't all the quiet, esp if you dropped it or it's bent or it's on an angle which makes the fan all sound it's grinding. yeah... i ended up swapping the one i had at work which they provided with the one i bought for myself."
3,Decent but has power issues,The device works decently at cooling my Mac Book Pro but I cannot run the fans at full power with either power adapter (wall and USB). If you try to run it at full speed with the USB power option it draws too much power and a Mac (don't know about Windows) will then disable that USB port. With the wall adapter I ran it full speed for about 5 minutes and then it crapped out. Using the fan at the middle speed though has worked well enough so far. The unit I personally think is well designed if only the power issue was to resolved it would be awesome.
5,Very good product!,It keeps my comp pretty cool. Very light and portable. For the price it is worth a try! Keeps my dell laptop significantly cooler!
1,Very poor,"This is a very poorly performing item, Firstly the fan speeds are very slow. Secondly the wiring is all very loose with ultra thin wires, The wire joins came off in few months after I got it, so it became absolutely useless. Overall it is a total waste of money. It's cheap, so you get what you pay for."
5,Simple and functional,"I read all the reviews before purchasing this product, and was a little skeptical. I've had it now for more than 3 days, and it's doing a very, very good job keeping my notebook cool. I really like that it's very light, and slim. It's comfortable on your lap, and the USB cable is of adequate length. And for the price I paid, I am definitely not complaining. Five stars all the way and highly recommend."
4,Vantec LapCool3 USB Notebook Cooling Pad,"The fans work great. They are not variable speed fans but they come with an on/off switch on the cord. The biggest drawback is the use of plastic. The plastic is quite flimsy for bigger laptops, especially the grills over the fans. If you aren't careful the plastic can be easily pushed down into the fan."
3,hope your laptop has brakes,"The structure and function of the fans is solid. Not ground breaking awesome cooling, but adequate. My beef is the fact that your laptop WILL slide off this device. I had to put some extra Velcro pads on the bottom of my laptop and the cooler to keep it from slipping off. So unless you are keeping the cooler on an ascending slope, your due to have your laptop, well, in your lap. Not on the cooler."
1,Not a Fan!,This item is noisy and I get double checked each time I go through airport security because it is made of metal. There are better options.
2,No noticable effect,"I got two of these, one for an XPS M1330 and one for an XPS M1730. I have the temperature censor running all the time and I have to say the mats don't really have a noticeable effect on the temperature. They are also quite plastic-y and cheap looking.I've given 2 stars purely because it keep my legs cooler (as it acts as a spacer).It probably works better on ultra-portable laptops which have low cooling ability and usually run very hot (like the X1)."
2,long name for nothing,"well, nobody said its nowhere said about that cooller which is actually for 14"" lap-tops, its small LOUD feels like i've bought iT in a dollar tree store for $1. front metal thing doesn't hold lap-top, it slips. idea is good, not making it flat, but its my first cooling pad, and i'am not sutisfied. looks like in the image, but its not worth IT!"
3,Computer Fan...ok,"Item came in great condition but it will turn on and off at will. I'm not sure it that's common for this item, but every time I move the laptop to reposition it, the fan turns off and I have to ""unplug"" it and it starts to work again. Over all, the product is OK...for the price, I should stop complaining."
5,Greater-than-expected durability,"March 2007: I am definitely a gentle user of this product. It's always just sitting on the desk underneath my laptop computer; I don't bang it around by using it when my computer is not on a flat surface (i.e. my lap). Despite this fact, I am definitely having durability issues with this product.Don't get me wrong, it still works to this day (a bit over 1 year later). But it's hit-or-miss as to whether it will work well (silently) or whether the motors will make a really annoying whining sound. This problem started around 8 months into its lifetime. When it's having problems, sometimes it's so loud I just have to unplug it. Other times it's making noise but is tolerable.March 2010 (UPDATE): I did not replace this product, and this problem seems to have remedied itself. It is now VERY rare that the fans will make the loud noises described above. Given the much greater-than-expected longevity of the product, I would love to change this review to five stars."
2,Great Pad and Price... BUT,"This is a great cooling pad, but the plug to the base is too loose. I have to jiggle mine around to get it to turn on, and then I can't touch it. With the slightest movement, the plug pops out or turns, causing the fans to shut off. It usually takes me a minute or two fiddling with the plug to get it set up properly without it shutting on and off. Spend a little more and get something better."
1,bad,"It dosen't work properly, when I put a lap top on top of it it begin s to do same noice, it wok bad"
3,"""Draw"" is Jacks-to-open","I bought the book for help with playing 5-card draw on the internet. Nowhere in the description of the book did I see that he discusses Jacks-to-open as his draw game. This is a very different game for guts-to-open that is played on internet sites that I know. I wish I had known.Then he spends the first 39 pages with an introduction and as many as 50 reasons for each of the following actions: Open, Call, Fold, Raise, Check, Bet, Bluff, Play, and Quit, including such gems as this reason for checking: You are planning to sandbag.He lists some errors that are commonly made by players, and I found this interesting, along with a few other things that prevented me from rating this lower than 3 stars."
5,"Simple, well made and gets the job done","I am very happy I found this vacuum. It is the best I have ever owned. It is simple with easy to change bags and belts. It seems to be very tough and has held up well to use. I have a large Labrador retriever that sheds a lot, so I have problems with dog hair that has quickly clogged every other vacuum I have tried. This one sucks up everything and has never clogged. The cord is long and sturdy. The bags are large and hold a lot. If you like fancy attachments and gimmicks then this probably isn't for you, but if you want something simple and easy that always gets the carpet clean then I highly recommend."
3,"Works as intended, not built for use in Oregon","Have used a DeWalt laser level and detector for years, had to purchase this one to replace the old one. The old one failed incrementally, with the speaker failing first, then the power button, then , the screen. It always malfunctioned when working in wet weather. Other than that, it is a good device, works well, obvious visual cues, and reliable -- except when it's raining."
5,Fennel Tea 24 Bags,"The product arrived when the seller said it would and in fine shape. It is a good quality and excellent for good health.Thank You, Judy"
2,Don't buy this.,"To anyone thinking of buying this as a gift for a teenager/young adult- DO NOT BUY. Myself an three of my friends have receive this as a gift, and it is not a good one. Unless you plug it in via the headphone jack to a good stereo or computer speakers, the sound for the record player is awful. No bass, tinny sound. The turntable is automatic, meaning it picks up at the ""end"" of a record and brings the stylus back ""home"", but it picks it up before all of my 7"" (45) records are done playing. It has a cheap needle that literally skips around the record- it leaves little marks on the vinyl and makes listening to records a chore and unenjoyable.This might be okay for someone who just wants to take a trip down memory lane with some of their old vinyl, but it is not a good purchase for someone who wants to listen to new records which have good sound quality.Thanks for nothing, Emerson."
4,Good listening,"The 4-in-1 is everything you could want. For those of us still with LPs and 45s, it plays them with fine fidelity. The CD performance is very good as is the cassette tape. Unless you are someone that wants to be able to load multiple CDs at a time, this is an excellent buy."
1,Frustrated customer,The item I purchased was defective and Discount Jungle was not flexible or sensitive about the issue. I am very unsatisfied with the customer service.
5,A Must for a New Technical Writer's Bookshelf,"I bought this book with an Amazon Christmas gift certificate from my supervisor. It was one of the wisest investments of my career! Hartman takes you through every step to develop a successful technical writing group.You are taken through the development process and project planning; the tasks of naming your group and getting necessary resources. You learn how to hire new employees, develop a style guide, write functional specs, and an information plan. The product development process is outlined with a summary and definition of the stages involved and the deliverables required at each stage.Project planning is covered quite well, but I would advise purchasing ""Managing Your Documentation Project"" (JoAnn Hackos), ""Developing Quality Technical Information"" (Gretchen Hargis), and ""One Minute Designer"" (Roger C. Parker). This combination is like having an entire technical writing curriculum at your fingertips."
3,Masterpiece of popular music,"Los Van Van have fused treasured traditions of Cuban music (namely rumba and son) and ground-breaking innovations of popular music (namely Rock), so that they created a new style ESongo. This album already shows visible sign of brilliant experiments of Los Van Van. The more you listen to them, the more you recognize the originality of them. On turning on the player, the distinguishing rhythm of strings and drums must surprise you."
5,I love this picture,"I saw this picture at a flea market and I just had to have it, I love it i have it in my bathroom"
2,"Well, maybe 2 1/2...","I found Mr. Benson's silly little novel, Queen Lucia, not to my taste or liking. I started feeling guilty about half way and became convinced my brain was headed into sugar shock. True cerebral cortex cotton candy. I know, I know.....it's a comedy of manners involving upper middle class small town England. And although I found it charmingly humorous at times--those were, I'm afraid, few and far between. Of course, maybe that's because I grew up in a town similar to the one depicted (on this side of the Atlantic) and, therefore, found myself rolling my eyes at many of the absurdities detailed in the book. Will I read another? Most doubtful. There are far too many ways I would prefer to spend my time--whether reading or whatever.I'm glad so many people seemed to enjoy this book. My hopes were fairly high. However, I find the comparison of this book/series to Jane Austen most vexing."
4,Oh DEAR LORD! HEEE HEEE!,"This movie is unquestionably one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time. The clown scene literally caused me to experience my first heart attack.(well maybe not, but I was laughing for 7 minutes straight) The killer chopsticks were brilliant, and the ancient prophecy was...well...hehehehehhe"
2,Poor video quality,"I agree with trofaman, the movie is just great. Complete nonsense with a poor storyline but really really funny. The main problem with this release is that video quality is very poor. This is why I don't recommended buying this DVD."
3,Splatter? Moure like a comedy.,"This troma montion picture is realy patetic!If you realy like stupid comedy movies wich is nearly two hours, you will love it. But if you dont have seen ""sgt kabukiman N.Y.P.D"" and have thought about it as an very bloody and gorey movie (Wich i first thougth) you will be sorry. But if you are a big troma fan, se it anyway cause it is not so bad."
1,This is a Troma movie?,"... ...this movie ...Oh god did it really ...I am a fan of troma movies like the Toxic Avenger,Class Of Nuke'm High ect.But man this movie did ...Cheesy special effects,bad acting.This movie had it all to make a really bad B movie."
4,"so it's not toxie, cry about it.","have any of you people who rated this lower than 3 stars heard of the phrase. ""seen one, seen them all."" troma goes against that formula a lot. troma is pretty good about making each of their films unique and not so much the same. well for sequels that is okay, but you people would be the ones saying ""toxie rip-off"" if this movie followed similar to that. sure, its no cheesy yet amazing gore fest such as toxie and terror firmer. it is a strange comedy movie and i like it for that. i have a feeling that the sequel will be a spectacular tromatic experience!funny quote: (to the monkey) you better not have led us to a banana factory, or else your going to be dog food.also, this dvd came out in 1997 and it is impressive that troma did dvds this good that early. tons of special features folks!"
1,"There's a reason why they call it ""The Boss"", IT'S LOUD!!!!!",It didn't work right from the time I took it out of the box. The third time I used it I had to take it apart cause' somethinginside it was rattling real bad! I was afraid it was already shot! The noise from that thing scared the daylights out of my cat. She's absolutly petrified of the thing! One time a big cloud of dust shot out of the side of it when I was vacumning!It never picked up anything that good. It couldnt take it anymore so I took it back to K-Marts and got a Hoover Runabout.It was loud but it worked much better.
5,THE Essential desk reference,"There are two books on my desk I consistently keep within arms reach:- 20,000 Words (5th edition, 1965 by Leslie - McGraw-Hill)- Strunk and White, The Elements of Style (3rd edition, 1979 - Macmillan)What I like about 20,000 words is the ability to quickly find words that I have no clue how to spell. Even with the best integrated spell checking technology today, if you don't know how to start spelling a word, technology will not help you. Quickly flip open the 20,000 Words book, however, and the quick division of words into syllables (syl*la*ble) has you scanning quickly within sections of the book.Likely fixed in this edition, the only word I routinely not included in the 1965 edition was penicillin. It's a shame I'm allergic to it ... penicillin, not this reference book.Never meant as a replacement for the dictionary, it's refreshing to find something so compact and useful that doesn't take up my entire desk."
3,Honda VF and VFR Interceptor,I bought this book because I ride a Honda VFR. It is a good resource for someone wanting to know a little more about their motorcycle. It covers a good deal of the history of the machine without getting tedious. The technical information gives you the basics without becoming pedantic.
2,the end of an era,I still don't get it... why an AMAZING band with a DISTINCTIVE & EXQUISITE sound became a bad copy of The Cure???
5,EXCELLENT-I'M BUYING MORE,"Both of my feet were swollen for months, and I can't take diuretics. My acupuncturist suggested I drink dandelion tea, so I bought this product and gave it a try. In less than two weeks my left foot was back to normal, and now after using almost the entire box my right foot is about 97% there. I follow the instructions for a ""decoction,"" which means I boil the teabags for 20 minutes. I make two cups at a time, drinking one hot and refrigerating the other and drinking it cold later on. I drink one to two cups a day, sometimes skipping a day. I'm not sure what else dandelion tea helps with, but for this alone it's worth it."
2,Not Dandelion Root tea!,"I ordered dandelion root tea. It says it on the box in the photo and in the description. What I received was dandelion leaf tea, a very different product. Very disappointed."
1,Bad tea,There is virtually no tea in the tea bags. Save your money and drink plain hot water it tastes about the same as adding tea...
1,Do NOT Buy This Piece Of Junk!!!!!!!,"I bought this vacuum a year ago and I am currently shopping for a different one.First, let me say something positive. I guess its a nice color.Now the rest. I smells like it is on fire.Like burning rubber.The hose kinks very easily. And is always getting clogged.The hose is too short.And the machine is always tipping over. Suction has never been very good. It is difficult to get the electic cord back inside the canister.Yesterday it started making a grinding noise. Do not,under any circumstances buy this vacuum."
1,Flawed Engineering!,"The design of the beater brush system on this machine suffers from a fundamentally flawed design. The beater brush bearing surface is felt on plastic. The drive belt applies a significant lateral load on the beater brush. Inevitably, the plastic on the housing gets hot and melts. In some instances this is likely to result in fire if you have hair or lint in your carpets."
1,Designed for short life,"A great vacuum at first, but I've encountered the same problems as others have. Wheels have become very squeaky, terrible rubber or plastic smell, picks up little. I'd like to check the brush roll belt, but the user manual is deficient and sort of punts, saying that for some models you remove 4 screws from the bottom side, then turn the unit over (sic?). I see only 2 screws, and they're not flathead or philips or allen. Apparently designed to discourage customers from fixing, more money for Eureka technicians. Talk about planned obsolescence, this one takes the cake. The Eureka website has little info & tries to push a subscription service."
2,Amusing idea that goes nowhere,Laughs are few and far-between in this limp parody of old sci-fi action movie serials. You're better off buying the real thing.
4,Great SCI FI book,Another great SCI-FI book from Ian Douglas. You should read the books in order. If you like action this book is for you. Worth your money.
5,saw this live,"I have to say kevin hart is hilariously funny! Saw him perform this stand-up live in richmond,va and was non-stop laughter. This dude is definitely going places and I can't wait to get this on dvd!"
5,"Seriously, it will make you laugh!","I like that Kevin doesn't base his comedy standup on the usual, e.g., racism, non-stop profanity, targeting the audience and other tactics most comedians rely upon. Well there are some choice words here and there. Kevin speaks of what he knows best (family) and gives you a hilarious 1 hour of laughter. I got my $$ worth and can't wait for him to come to my part of the west coast so I can check out his show in person."
4,LAUGHED THE WHOLE TIME!,"DEFINITELY WORTH THE WATCH! HAD ME LAUGHING THE WHOLE TIME. THE SHAQ JOKE WAS HILARIOUS...EVEN LEBRON JAMES STOOD UP LAUGHING! THIS MOVIE REALLY IS ""SERIOUSLY FUNNY""! WISH IT WAS LONGER."
4,Good price and tough item.,The only problem with these mandrels is the screw is a little too big for Dremel and after market attachments. I just drill the hole bigger. Otherwise they are great.
5,Fun & 2 in 1!,"Our little one had fine motor skill delays & didn't like the smaller bricks we had; so we decided to try Mega bloks. This wagon is a hit! Yes, it makes a huge mess when he dumps it over every morning, but he is now also learning to put the bloks IN! We got some extra bloks; so the wagon is overflowing. It's durable enough that we'll bring it outside this spring. I noticed the wagon has holes in the bottom, and that probably allows water to drain out if you leave it outside. We peeled off the big sticker easily & like the big red wagon--expecting it to last a while! What a bargain!"
1,Wagon I received not like picture,"I ordered this wagon for my grandson because the picture looked like the one I have at my home. He really enjoyed mine when he came to visit. The wagon he received was not like the one I have and was not like the one in the picture. It does not have the blue sides where he can build up the sides of the wagon. The plastic feels cheap and is bendable, not good for a wagon.The wagon I have is sturdy enough that he can sit in it. (He is 18 months old.) I would not let him sit in the new one.The biggest disappointment is that I searched the web for a wagon that looked like mine and was quite happy when I found it. That doubled my disappointment when my daughter called to say that the wagon was not like mine."
5,This is a great toy.,"My son received this toy when he was 2 or 3 he is now 6 yrs old and still plays with it. I now have a 2 yr old who loves the toy just as much. We use the wagon all the time the kids love to build bridges and castles on top of the wagon. They love the wagon as much as the blocks. My 2 yr old likes to also put toys in the wagon and pull it around the house. The blocks do get all around the room but the kids are great at picking them up.when there done playing we make a game out of clean up and shoot the blocks in the wagon, who ever gets the most blocks in, wins. Great gift idea"
5,Great Fun,We have had these blocks for 3 years and they are played with often! Both of our kids love these blocks and can spend hours creating new wonders.
2,Completely overhyped and full of boring filler,"Like so many people I liked their hits Turn and Why Does It ALways Rain On Me?, so I expected a pretty good CD. I was to be seriously disappionted. The songs on here are generally slow and plodding, and an attempt at infusing passion which just doesn't work. The Fear has to be the gloomiest song I've ever heard although Luv comes close. Worse, they're incredibly derivative. When I realised that As You Are borrows the tune of She's Electric by Oasis I thought they were taking the mickey, and the way they think the lyrics of Slide Show, nodding to Beck, Oasis and the Manic Steet Preachers, are very clever, but in reality they are naff. I'm sure there's more I haven't noticed, and when people say the songs sound like you've heard them before, it's because you have. A million times. What a waste of money,"
3,Faux Radiohead,"Or Radiohead Lite, whichever you prefer. Sweet soaring melodies, great production, but lame lyrically.This is a pleasant enough disc, but it has no edge, nothing that grabs you. Comparisons to Radiohead are far fetched. Travis isn't on the same planet musically or artistically."
5,Just a great album,"An almost complete departure from Travis's first album. All you can really say about this is that it's perfect pop, whistful, melodic and endlessly playable. I admit it took me a year to buy it. I finally decided I just couldn't do without it.My favourite track is - Um, all of them. The hit singles are interspersed with less played tracks, which at first I thought were sub-standard (a very high standard has been set here, mind you), but after several plays, I realised the whole thing hangs together perfectly. I'll be listening to this for many years to come."
3,Listen,"Great songs, like their style, music is alternative. If you like snow patrol, 3 doors down and Lifehouse you will like this. The ""Single"" album/CD is the best."
2,Artist not mentioned?,"I'm concerned that the copyright on this might not be legitimate, since the artist isn't mentioned. His name is Jim Fitzpatrick, and he definitely deserves the financial benefit of his incredible talent."
3,OK as long as you don't drop it,"I've had this timer for a while and only recently figured out you can skip the clock/timer button and just start typing a time in for it to countdown to. And I did like how it would start counting up after the time went up--I use it to create 50 minute work periods and since I often don't stop right when the alarm sounds, it's good for me to see how long I've gone over.But like others have said, it's annoying that it always seems to be counting something, whether you're using it or not. And the keys are definitely a bit squishy, so sometimes you have to hit them twice.The biggest flaw to me though is after I dropped it onto my wood floor, the alarm stopped sounding. No matter what I do, it will count down but won't alert me at 0. I know dropping it is not probably among OXO's recommended uses (LOL), but come on--one drop should not totally kill the alarm. At the very least, there should be some way to easily open the unit and fix whatever is out of place."
4,Home Duty/Heavy Duty Drill,"Nice little drill for home maintenance. The 14.4V is the only drawback, it is slightly underpowered. But the Dewalt construction is superb making this overall a very good choice."
3,Review,"Interesting reference book as told from a toddler's perspective. Areas of concern to parents are defined and addressed as a three year old seems them.Definitely a book that makes you stop and think, as a parent, of how your child might be seeing how you and other adults act. (And how little sense we sometimes make.)A quick and easy read with some worthwhile reminders about how to be a good mom or dad!"
2,Meh,"The writing style here is so disjointed that what information is provided in the text is better learned from other sources. It's also a little off-putting that they text does not include any footnote citations, so it's impossible to tell what sources the author uses if you want to go to the original writing. Ok for a popular historical work, but does not strike me as a source of research."
1,Was This Version Directed by Kafka?,"Aarghh! What did U.S. Manga do to this movie! In its original 3-part form, Yotoden is a wonderful, fast-paced anime with a gripping and involving storyline that keeps you hooked to the very end. In this version, however, over 30 minutes of fantastic (and necessary) footage has been inexplicably cut, resulting in a movie that is totally disjointed and difficult to follow. Major plot and character developments have been removed in a careless and seemingly desultory fashion and scenes have been rearranged in a futile attempt to tie together the now-jumbled storyline. Couple this with a horrible dubbing job and subtitles done by someone who is obviously painfully unfamiliar with the linguistic nuances of Japanese in reference to historical events and you have a nearly unwatchable anime. Thank you very much, US Manga, for taking the finest in Japanimation and mutilating it for Western consumption."
4,awesome!,"This was a really well put together anime, incredible animation, great battle scenes, very good story, and average dubbing. Some of the music isn't very good, but it does have it's high points. Wrath of the Ninja wasn't the best, but it ranks up there with Slayers and Dirty Pair. If you like anime and non-stop action, this is a must buy!"
2,"It's OK, More like a rental","There isn't allot I can say about this anime, but if I had to make the choice of purchasing this DVDagain; I wouldn't . Final Criticism: Story Line: OK/ Animation: OK/ Overall: Rent it if you can don't buy it"
4,"Good,... but I've seen better.","When I first saw this movie in the video store I thought that the plot sounded interesting enough. And it was for about the fist half of the film. After a while the plot seemed to wane and became quite obscure as the movie went on. I will admit that the transitions from scene to scene weren't the clearest, but they weren't horrible. I have seen my share of bad anime films, but this just doesn't fit in with any of them. I think that the creators did a pretty descent job of putting this film together. But, I must admit that I did lose interest from time to time. Perhaps if they wouldn't have cut out anything from the series, I probably would have enjoyed the movie much more than I had. However many of its flaws, it still was a pretty good movie. I would definately recomend that anyone interested in this film to watch it and make your own decision."
5,"Absolutely ""brilliant"" target.",I used this target while laying out the foundation for a barn I am building in the high country of New Mexico. The target was brilliantly visible even in the fierce light of the noon-day sun.
1,Almost Useless,"The item I received was 3""x5"", not 5""x9"" as advertised, and was made of simple pink plastic, not even laser-reflective. As such, it is virtually useless for enhancing laser-reflectivity. I'd sorta call it a hoax... I returned it."
1,Worthless garbage,"First of all, let me state that I'm a systems/network engineer who has built out a wireless internet service provider that covers over 100 square miles. So, I know a thing or two about networking, both wired and wireless. In short, this device flat out does not work. I know some people complain that this device is only 802.11b, but 11Mbps (tops) is perfectly fine for printing, so I thought I was getting something useful cheap. I was wrong.Two windows laptops and one Mac OS X 10.4.7 laptop can see the Ad-Hoc WLAN-PS network, but cannot connect. The Mac laptop fails to connect and asks if I want to try again. One of the Windows laptops tries to connect but will not succeed. The other connects, but for some tries to get a DHCP network address, even though I used a static address of 192.168.0.5. Even my Linux desktop couldn't see it.After 3 hours wasted, it's going back to the store. After this experience, I won't be buy the Dlink 802.11g version, either."
1,D-link wireless print server,"Couldn't get it to work, contacted D-Link tech, they couldn't make it work...returned it to amazon."
3,You guys know these are $1 each at walmart?,I don't get why they are so expensive on Amazon. Either way these are kind of gross. Enjoy!
5,Tree Castle Island,Tree Castle Island is a book about a boy whose parents leave him at his Uncle Hamp's house for a couple of weeks. He built a canoe and went on journey to find a Sun Daughter. He came to an Island and heard strange sounds at night. Soon he found a boy exactly like him who was making the sounds. He didn't know if he was dreaming or not. Everything about the boy was exactly the same thing about himself. This would be a great book for someone who likes adventure and mystery.
5,The best,This is the best toothpaste ever made! I actually look forward to bushing my teeth. It leaves your mouth super minty clean beyond anyother toothpaste.
1,On my fourth replacement unit now,"Maxtor 1.5 TB OneTouch III Turbo Edition Hard Drive ( C01W015 )Bought a unit of this item about a year ago (not from Amazon, I may add), but the unit failed after about 6 months, I got a replacement unit, failed after about 2 months, and my third replacement unit failed after 1 month. Now I'm on my 4th replacement unit which I've just received, and it seems the end of the line, since Maxtor said the warranty has expired (1 year). Never getting a Maxtor again for me..."
3,Crashes my Vista Computer,"There appears to be a serious problem with compatibility of this drive and my Dell XPS computer using a Vista OS. It was extraordinarily difficult to get the computer to recognize the presence of the drive, and it took hours of work with Dell tech support to get it to the point that it did. Thereafter, it could copy files, but with frequency its attachment results in a crash of the computer. This likely results (I have no evidence for this) from the general incompatibility of Vista with a lot of hardware, even with software generated by the manufacturer of the hardware that supposedly is Vista compatible. Hopefully the patch for Vista due out, I am told, within the next month, will help cure this problem."
3,EL TESTAMENTO,"LA TRAMA ESTA BUENA, AUNQUE EN ALGUNOS CAPITULOS ENTRA TANTO EN DETALLES QUE ABURRE UN POCO, EL FINAL ESTA MUY BUENO TAMBIEN."
3,Interesante pero no genial,"Este libro cuenta la historia de un extravagante multimillonario que al morir deja una herencia repartida inesperadamente, dados los conocimientos que tiene de su propia familia. Es un libro interesante, pero definitivamente se hace un poco tedioso en algunos capitulos."
5,Who is responsible?,"This could be an amazing real story, he knows his family and how they think of him, so that's why he want to take revenge in his testament, may be this is because the way he educate them and in that case who's the responsible for their acts?"
4,As advertised,This antenna did the job as promised. Many hours of Sat. Radio on the deck by the pool and it still works like a charm.
4,awwsome,Just what I needed..... Easy to purchase and use. Funny that it costs more to ship than the cost of the item.
2,"handy reference, lousy tape","The book is an excellent reference, and came in handy more than once when I found myself at a small czech pub, trying to deal with waiters who don't speak English, and menus entirely in Czech. However, I would have liked to see more words and detail, especially in the food section. Once I thought I was ordering a typical czech fried pork steak--it turned out to be liver!The tapes were a joke for the most part. But I was able to get some use out of them as a supplement to the ""Colloquial Czech"" course by James Naughton I was taking at the same time, and as a very handy sleeping aid. The relaxation exercises will knock you out every time."
2,Berlitz Phrase book,"It is similiar to other Berlitz phrase books but the phonetics were hard to follow because Czech sounds so different from English.We didn't use it - we managed to find enough english speaking Czechs (waiters, etc)"
3,One of the better direct to dvd horror films,"This movie was really surprisingly good.considering its a direct to dvd movie and an indie slasher the director shows that if he had more money to work with we'd have another icon of horror.the story itself is really good and creepy(i dont wanna spoil it),the monster and his backstory are original,and his face without the plaster cast(seen in the begining of the film)is trully a greusome sight to behold.i think horror fans will be really surprised by the quality of this film.not much gore or blood but its understandable considering the budget this movie probably had.hopfully they make a sequal,with a bigger budget.but go see this film,rent it if you dont wanna buy it but trust me horror and slasher fans will NOT be disapointed."
3,All time classic,A true classic reference book from one of the real masters in the field. Personally I find the small print a bit difficult to read but the amount of information packed into the pages is amazing. Would have been good if there were more details on aquarium set up.
2,Overproduced,"The quality talent of Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Richard Pryor and the legendary Lena Horne cannot save this souless overblown motion picture soundtrack of the Tony Award winning musical. Buy the joyous original cast album (featuring dynamic perfomances by Stephanie Mills, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Taisha Thomas and Ted Ross) instead because it amply proves that less is indeed much more."
5,Marvelous!,"This collection is absolutely great! I never realized how much content was edited out of the versions aired on the Cooking Channel. These episodes are longer, more hilarious, and thoroughly entertaining. I highly recommend it."
4,I HAVE A GREAT IDEA AND IT WORKS,"Go to any store that sells CD and DVD accessories and get MAXELL ""SLIMS"".It costs $2.00 plus tax for five cases. You get assorted colors pick your favorite. Now here's the painful part, You'll have to cut the case (thus removing the hinged section) as round as possible.Put your dvd in the plastic(top part optional) then put that in the tin and your disc is protected.Two dollars isn't a lot of money. But I wish F.H.E. had the consideration to do this since they saved a ton of money on giving us NO EXTRAS.not even subtitles.Also the tin steering wheel doesn't have the letters.One more volume to go to complete the series. A simple cardboard slipcase to hold five discs, four for the series, and one for the bonus features would be very proper.Anyway you get 13 great episodes.There are 52 in all."
5,Speed Racer,I purchased this video for my grandsons. They enjoyed watching these episodes a lot. The movie was in great shape and was received before expected. I would buy again from this seller.
4,Entertaining,"My 6 year old son loves speed racer, but the movie version is not his speed! He enjoys these classic videos and has several in the series. More appropriate for a little boy who enjoys the speed racer toys. My 8 yr old girl also enjoys them!"
2,buy at your own risk,"ive had this radio since 2003 and it has been good to me the first year. after that, its been all down hill. the other guy was right about alot of the defects exept i never had a problem with the fan...lol. my biggest complaint was that after a while, it wouldnt play certain cd's. now, even brand new cd's wont play in this deck. the only thing that is good about this deck is the sound quality, MINUS, the loud setting going out when you skip to the next song. just like the guy said you turn down the volume it comes back. all in all, you get what you pay for. it was my first in-dash dvd thats why im giving it 2 stars insted of one. just save the money and get a more expensive clarion, pioneer, or somthing of that caliber."
2,misleading name,"I thought this would smell alot diferent -- and better -- than what this product actually smells like. Cocoa bliss? Anybody would expect based on that name for it to smell somewhat like cocoa: chocolate-like. It doesn't. It smells (weakly) like white peach, and the ""cocoa"" is a reference to the scentless cocoa butter moisturizer the spray has.This is not a terrible product or a terrible scent, but it's not something I would have knowingly purchased either had I known what it smelled like."
2,"Waiting for an Alibi, Tommy","First off...Tommy Vance is a ""hack"" documentarian. The historical footage is sparse, most live material being taken from one or two shows. Some of the live material is recreated using a psuedo-psyche posterising effect. Very cheesy! The real crime: Most of the interviews are with subordinate characters. NO interviews with Scott, either Brian, Gary, Snowy, etc, etc. Were they all unavailable? The VH-1 ""Behind the Music"" from a few years ago was much better. One saving grace is the interview material with Eric Bell."
5,A literary review of the Central Valley,"Through poetry and prose, a fair amount of it sprinkled with Spanish, editor Yogi presents the natural history of the Valley along with absentee landlord farmers who dammed, diked and irrigated it, or got the government to do it for them... and the various underclasses of different races and ethnic groups imported to the Valley to do the grunt work of farming it.But this is much more than farm and nature history. The sociological distinctions of the different inhabitants are a central part of this book. See the kalidescope of California."
5,Fascinating insight into children's health and health care,This book provides a wonderful overview of each body systems and then tells the story of children with different health concerns. The explanations of how different organs function are easy to understand and provide context to the stories that follow.One of the things I like best is that Dr. Sanghavi does not make himself into a hero or know-it-all. He expresses a genuine interest in and acknowledgement of the individuality of each child.My only complaint is that it seems a little unfair that Dr. Sanghavi can be so gifted as both a physician AND a writer!
3,Ummm... That's a good ballads selection,"This CD has a good selection of ballads, but after bought it I think there's better ballads to included in a CD."
3,way oversized!!!,"Normally I wear a XXL glove, but with this, i would probably be ok with a medium, or maybe a large. Ordered an XL, and I have fat fingers, yet the leather keeps popping off of my ring finger, and is loose on the middle & pointer fingers. If you are skinny, this will probably be worse! I'd recommend either order at least 2 sizes small, or keep looking.As far as the quality of this glove is concerned, it seems to be perfectly average. Nothing special or noteworthy, but also no huge negatives. The way the leather is sewn together on the fingers takes a little getting used to, but that's what practice is for!"
3,"Looks great, but doesn't work as well as regular finger tabs do.","Bought this one along with a different finger tab for my girl's bow because a 20lbs draw weight was too harsh on her fingers. As cool as it looks, the leather tips are just too stiff and slippery to grab the string without constant fear of it accidentally slipping off in mid-draw unless you either monkey-grip the string or are VERY careful to keep the pads of your fingers flat against the string.As my girl pointed out, adding razorblades to the fingertips would make for a killer Freddy Krueger glove on halloween, though!"
2,Negative Undercurrent,"Besides this book, I purchased at the same time The Insiders' Guide to Baltimore, which is $2.00 more and 150 pages longer. I give this City Smart guide 2 stars, compared to a 5 star rating on the Insiders' Guide. The reason for the wide difference in rating the two books: This book, City Smart, is trying to be hip, flippant, and tounge-in-cheek. Instead, it comes off as very negative. I purchased the two books at the same time, read this one first, and when I was done I really wasn't sure I wanted to visit Baltimore. And that would be a mistake because Baltimore is indeed Charm City, and the other book really brings that out. It has a much more upbeat, positive, optimistic, good-natured style; as well as more depth and details in the extra 150 pages. The Insiders' Guide was true to the Baltimore I discovered, this City Smart guide was off-putting and off the mark."
5,It's a good product,"I bought it about a month ago, and have no any problem with it. Actually I like it. The sound is clear and less noise. it free my hands during the talking especially for those long chats.One suggestion is if it can add a switch on microphone to mute, it will be even better.Another concern is duration. Since I'm a new user, not sure the life time"
1,Turned staticy after a few uses,"I bought this for taking conference calls at home and after only a few uses, there is background static noise that the other party can hear. Totally disappointing."
5,great audio quality and very comfortable,"I received it this afternoon and cannot wait to use it for my conf call in the evening. The voice quality is so good that I felt people spoke next to me. Also other attendees said they heard me much much clear than before. Although it was a 1+ hour conf call, my ear felt no irritation after call. Not sure how this works with other brand phones, but I highly recommend this headset to everyone who needs to free up both hands when using Panasonic phone. It is not expansive, good audio quality and comfortable."
4,Light and comfortable,"Light and comfortable headset, works great, sometimes the microphone gets too close to my mouth but it's ok I just try to bend it away."
4,So handy for hands-free connunication,"I use this with my portable, and just love it. It makes keeping in contact, even when I'm busy away from my desk, so easy, clear, and comfortable -- both for me, and for my clients.I'm very glad I bought it."
3,Okay,"Not particularly comfortable, but sound is decent. A little bulky if you're used to cell phone headsets. According to those I've spoken to while using this, I sound a little ""distant"" but not as much as with previous headsets."
2,Lasted 3 months,Worked perfectly for 3 months but now has a humming sound that makes the headphones completely useless. Tried to return but am apparently outside of the return window.
3,headset,Careful... This only works with 2.5mm jack.. Before buying this product please make sure that your device has 2.5 mm jack. Usually computers and laptops have 3.5 mm jack.
2,Breaks always at the same place,"I've been through at least 3 of these. Though the reviews are right that the sound is good and it is quite comfortable, it's not clear why Panasonic does not fix the simple flaw--except if it's to get us buying more. The head band and the ear piece are held together with a flimsy piece of plastic that breaks with the slightest tension. Mine, like other reviewers', is currently glued together.I am looking for a different model, as the price no longer justifies the product."
1,Horrible!,"I wear headsets with each call - I like to be hands free! I have one for my home office and one for my living area. My office headset finally quit and I had to buy another. Unfortunately, I was not able to locate my original brand headset, so I bought this one.This headset is the worst I have ever used! I have a small head where even small caps are too big and this headset was extremely tight and not adjustable to the head. My ear hurt in minutes. The worst part of this headset is the crackling noise! When the cord is moved, it crackles and makes a conversation inaudible. Even when trying to be extremely still, the headset crackles. The crackle is not on my phone as my one original headset still works beautifully.I will not be using this again and am extremely disappointed. The only good news with this was it was not expensive. :("
2,Poor sound quality,"I own the KX-TCA92 with volume control & like it. The ear piece broke away from the headest, so I bought this KX-TCA60 since the reviews were good & I have volume control on my phone. It is not a good head set. People on the other end kept saying to talk louder & that my voice sounded muffled. Even removing the mic cover and talking diectly into the holes didn't help. Swapping out the TCA92 during the same phone call without adjusting anything else improved sound quality & volume."
3,It's hip to be square,"Just like you would expect. Comfortable, adjustable, bulky, unsightly... I like it. I often start to sing Madonna songs with it on. It is all it promises to be."
3,HUMMING is driving me crazy,"We have had this product for 3 years and it has performed well. However, in the last few months the product is causing a very loud humming in the ear piece. Callers have also mentioned that they can hear the loud humming."
3,good product,good product that work great for the function and features that I enjoy. sad to say the phone that came with it did not work out too well.
3,"Too tight, but does the trick","This headset was a steal -- reduced rate, even -- so I can't really complain about any downsides. Still, anyone reading this should be aware that it is way too tight and unadjustable (and I have a child-size head!). Otherwise, the sound quality is just fine, both speaking and listening. No problems so far, and I've had it about a month. I should note that I am using it with a nonportable speakerphone."
2,Can not stand it and got it replaced after 8 months,"I purchased this headset together with the corded phone that I have ordered. On the package, it indicates it is for cordless phone use. It works fine with my cordless phone. And when I have received the corded phone, it works for that as well. What a relife!However, it dose need a 2.5mm to 3.5mm audio adaptor in order to use on my laptop. It works fine. But I probably would have ordered a model that has two ear pieces instead.Update after using it for few months: One of reviewer was right. Somehow, I can listen to people perfectly fine but people can hardly hear me, even after I have adjusted the volume on my phone. Finally, I have replaced it with an over the ear hands-free headset from local RadioShack.[updated after 8 months] I can hear people OK but people have problem hearing me."
5,Keepers,"Good basic headset. Fit snugly into the phone without any wiggling which causes squealing. Good price, too! No mute button or volume control, but you probably have that on your phone. Just have a little clip on the cord. Good sound, so assuming they don't wear out super fast, I would buy these again."
2,Good while it lasted,"I liked this a lot, but the headband snapped after just a short time. I didn't use it daily, only when I was on a long call. I'd guess maybe it was used an average of 1-2 times/week and lasted for approximately 6-8 months. Cheap enough, and callers could hear me just fine, but it just didn't last."
5,love it,"This headset is super comfortable. Way more comfortable than the kind where you have to stick a portion in your ear. I love that you can use the headset with either the right ear or the left ear. You can keep the microphone right in front of your mouth, or you can move it up a bit if you want to take a drink of something and the person can hear you just as well (I tested it.) I've had it for about a month and use it daily. There is a helpful clip that you can use to clip the cord to your shirt, so you don't get it snagged on something as you're moving about."
4,Good Investment,"The Panasonic headset is comfortable, easy to use and has excellent sound. While not expensive, so far this headset is the best one I have owned and I would buy another without hesitation."
3,finally found a cordless to use this with,I bought this headset partly based on positive feedback of others. It is a simple design which I like. It works well with my Nokia cell phone. It did not work with a Motorala cordless 5 ghz phone. Oddly enough it did not work with a Panasonic cordless phone either. Both microphone did not amplify nearly enough. I did hook it up to an Olympia 2.4 ghz cordless phone and it works great. Too bad the cordless phones aren't more standardized.
1,May not be compatible with 5.8Ghz cordless phones,"I purchased this headset based on the reviews and price. However, the headset did not work with my 5.8GHz, AT&T 5840 cordless handset. There was considerable static and I could not be heard well. I checked the product package and it stated that the headset is compatible with 900MHz and 2.4GHz analog/digital phones. There was no specific compatibility information on Amazon.com so I had no reason not to think it would work with my 5.8GHz phone. Many reviewers have said that the KX-TCA86 is not as good but for me that is not the case. I purchased this headset at Best Buy after checking the package and seeing that it was compatible with 5.8GHz phones. I can be heard perfectly (better than from the handset I am told) and I can hear perfectly. So if you have a 5.8GHz phone I would stay away from this headset and get the KX-TCA86 instead."
1,Not suggested if using a converter plug,"Most of these headsets have a standard headset jack. To plug it into the iPhone, you need a converter. I am not sure if the converter caused issues or the headset was bad on its own, but I would NOT recommend this headset if you plan to use a converter plug. During calls, there is a base drum sound in the ear of the receiver on the side of the person being called by the headset phone. This noise is NOT apparent to the caller (who is using the headset)."
1,You get what you pay for....,"I bought this because it was low cost and some other reviews said it has clear sound. I can hear with it just fine, but I've had to stop using it because people on the other end ALWAYS complain of an echo, whether I use this with a landline or a cell phone. Maybe it works better if you use it with a PC, but I am having to buy another headset as this one is unusable for my normal daily business calls."
2,Cheap,Its cheap and it does the job but its not very durable and isn't comfortable. I've been using it for 3-4 months now and its starting to have static when your move the jack.
3,"Very good sound quality, flimsy construction","The sound quality is excellent, both in the earpiece and from the microphone. The headband construction is very flimsy, however, as can be expected from something so inexpensive. The plastic tab that holds the adjustable piece breaks very easily, and you may wind up having to finesse the earpiece into a stable position. It's still completely usable, just a little awkward."
2,Worked and then it didn't work,The headset seemed to work okay for a couple of days and then the sound worked only part of the time. I returned it and would not want another.
5,KX-TCA60,Head sets make it very easy to use the phone hands free and have very clear sound. It does not pick up background noise that may bother the party you re talking to. very nice.
4,Good product,"I use this headset with my blackberry when I am working. It is pretty good. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because a couple have people have told me that ""it sounds like I am on speaker phone or far away"" when I am talking to them. It's not too bad but it's enough to notice. For the low cost, it is definitely a worthwile purchase."
4,A great headset - Must Have,I initially bought this headset thinking it would work with my iPhone 5 and Macbook Pro. It does not work with either of those. But it does work wonderfully with my Panasonic cordless phone. Its comfortable and the sound quality is great. I also love that the cord is long so you can place the phone down and move around pretty easily. And the fact that its less than $10 is even better. I just wish it worked with my iPhone and Macbook Pro.
4,Very good vaule (performance for the money),"The microphone could have a louder volume, but it works just fine. Excellent value for the cost."
4,Great headset for price,"I have used this headset daily (maybe an hour or two a day) for about 10 months and it has been great. People can hear me, I can hear them -- excellent qualities in a headset :-) It is not super comfortable or super adjustable, but it's really just fine. I love having my hands free. I use it with a cordless phone and just carry the phone around with me if I need to move around the house. If I need both hands, I will slip the handset into my pocket if I have one, or ""make"" a pocket out of whatever shirt I have on both folding it up and securing it with two clothespins! don't laugh! My 14 year old thought it up, and it works really well.Single big downside, this headset is cheaply constructed and the headpiece snapped (non repairable) after 10 months. I just ordered another one, but feeling slightly guilty for using something I know is not durable and is not recyclable."
2,Not too great,"I can hear the speaker at the other end well enough, but apparently my voice sounds like it's under water, or else there is a constant hum in the background. Ultimately not very useful, but not worth the price of sending back."
4,Works fine for casual use,"I purchased this headset specifically for a training I was participating in via conference call from home. It was to span 12 hours over a weekend and I knew I needed a headset of some kind. I chose this headset from Amazon based on the decent reviews and low price. I knew it was not something I would use daily. This headset provided clear audio and the microphone seemed to work well. It is not as comfortable as one could be, but I did not expect it to be the best. I would recommend this headset for casual use, but I would probably spend a little more for all-around quality if it was something I would use daily for hours on end."
1,HJH3,"Disappointing. The earphone works fine but the microphone mutes my voice. I used it once, the person that I was talking with could barely hear me. Into the trash it goes."
1,Broke after 1 week,"I wouldn't purchase this product because after one week of using, the callers couldn't hear me, I could only hear them. I had to by another headset."
1,doesn't work with iPhone,"Do not order this to use with your iPhone. Despite suggestive advertising, it is not compatible."
3,Headset,"I have not have not been able to use it,that is the only reason I gave this product this rating."
2,not satisfied,I now have the model that is the next price up from panasonic and am very pleased. This model was not good. It is flimsy and I accidentally pushed it too hard and it cracked. I also did not like the fact that there was not volume control and the caller sounded extremely loud. Other than that its an ok piece. I do not recommend it and think you would be pleased as I am with the next higher model from panasonic.I hope this helps someone.
2,Not very good,"Just okay for the price. I have had some complaints from people saying they could not hear me. Very cheap, mostly plastic. Would have give it another star if it fold like my old one for storage. Will use until I can find something better."
2,"Okay, until it breaks","I've ordered/used multiple of these headsets in the past. They work well and are comfortable enough, while they last. Each one that I've had has eventually broken, due to a poor design/materials used on the head band. The plastic is very thin and easily snaps (particularly at the adjustable area), causing the thing to break and become useless eventually. It might work for 3 months, 6 months or a year, but if you use it often, it will surely break on you."
2,quality low,Have bought many Panasonic products in past but New Panasonic is focussing on low price rather than high qualityBought four headphones and after few months wire connections to head set breaking and initial indication is crackling noiseWill not buy Panasonic products until they go back to high qualityWill pay more for high quality and will chose other brands
2,Cheap microphone makes this on a poor value,"Bought three of these for the low price and the Panasonic name.But people whom I call ALL tell me that the sound of my voice - via the headset's microphone - is awful. So I'm upgrading to a $20 headset to see if that's any better.If you use a phone and headset professionally, this one's not for you."
3,Not as good as Plantronics Headset M210C,"I had a Plantronics Headset M210C which was dead after more than 1 year, then I got this one. I would say that Plantronics M210C is much more comfortable and clear than this one. The only good thing of KX-TCA60 is it is cheaper than Plantronics M210C. I would recommend Plantronics."
1,Narrow Tin Can Sound,"Do not buy this headset. The sound is tinny --incrediably so. I figured, ok, no problem, I'll get use to that. But when I made my first call and had to have the person repeat their name 4 times because I couldn't understand what they were saying, I knew this thing was going back. Alas....."
2,Hit and Miss,"The product came timely. I just find sometimes that people say it is creating a horrible hiss, and I have to terminate the call. Other times they say it is clearer than when I don't use it! Who knows! More often I find it not working properly."
4,Great for the money,"This headphone delivery good quality voice (receiving and sending) and is comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It is not particulary compact, but this has proven not to be a problem."
2,This headset is a huge disappointment,"I bought this hands-free Panasonic handset to use with a new Panasonic phone so I can keep my hands free to type editorial changes my clients want to make. Problem is that I can't hear them very well, even with the volume set to max on the phone itself. As far as I'm concerned, this headset is totally useless."
5,Just what we needed,"My husband has a medical issue with one of his hands making it unavailable to hold the phone at his business. He was using speakerphone so he could take notes while on calls with customers but that just doesn't work well with conversation. So we picked this item up and it works great. Comfortable for lengthy periods, great sound on both ends, for a very reasonable price. A great buy for us!"
2,In a well...,Usually Amazon reviews are a good indicator of a product's quality. Not this time. Most everyone tells me I sound like I'm in a well. Would not recommend this headset even at this low price.
1,Don't waste your money.,"First headset worked well for 8 weeks then a loud buzzing noise. Ordered a second one because it was inexpensive and I thought maybe it was a fluke that it went bad so quick. 2nd one came out of box and it did not work. Also, no way to contact seller which would have made the return process easier."
3,sound decrease,"A reasonable product does what its supposed to but find the volume decreases, very faintly. Am I doing something wrong?"
2,Poor voice clarity,"Used this headset with my mobile phone for conference calls...in two separate calls, the persons on the other end had difficulty hearing me. I wound up just unplugging the headset and holding the phone to my head for 4+ hours. I would not recommend this if being used with a cell phone. Also, note the jack size...it's 1.5mm, not the standard 2.5mm found on most cell phones."
3,Mixed feelings,"The connector into my phone isn't tight like others I've owned. Some people say they hear a crackle, and when I remove the headset and talk straight into my phone, they say I sound fine. This seems to be a random problem, and I think that it's the pin that connects into my phone. The cord is heavy-duty, thicker than others I've owned. The head piece that goes over my head is rather tight, a little bit uncomfortable, and my head is small to medium sized. I haven't owned it long, so don't know what it's life span will be."
4,Handy replacement for not holding on to a phone,Makes it easier to have a conversation without having to hold the phone. Only issue is that it is setup to be used on one side rather that either side.
4,"Broke after two years, perfect besides","All told, for the money I got a lot of use out of this thing and it just broke on me a few days ago, after 2 years (headset kind of came apart, still usable, but barely). Still, for the money it made conference calls--I do a lot for my jobs--so much easier and nicer. Same with long talks to relatives, friends, etc. I liked it enough where I just bought another one."
3,Head set,"When first use it, it work great but after a few times plugging it to my phone and unplugging it the connecton began to get loose and static was interfering as my friends told me as I was talking to them. So now I don't use it. Great buy for the price. If you just want something simple,then this is the one!"
4,KX-TCA60 Headset - Great Headset,"I work virtual I.T. and use this headset 8 hours a day, with a Nokia Cell phone. I have had it for 6 months now with no problems. It is very comfortable, the sound is great. At $8.95, how can you beat it.I wish it had a mute button, but other than that, no complaints."
2,Panasonic,The Panasonic KX-TCA60 is not as easy to hear or be heard when connected to my home phone as compared to the Plantronics headset that I currently use.The Plantronics headset does not work great with my home phone but it is better than the KX-TCA60.
5,Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset,Right now it is in testing mode will call center. Possible will be ordering more.
4,"Works great. As expected, built cheap.","It's under $10 and works great! With that said, anything that cheap in price is also cheap in build. I put a little weight on it accidentally and it snapped. Just treat it carefully."
2,Headband way to large,The headband is way to large and my wife and I must wear it at an angle to make is usable.
2,great till it stopped working,this thing worked great for about two months then all of a sudden it stopped working. trying to send it back under warranty
4,Good for ocasional use- gone through 3 in 3 years,"Out of the headsets I've used for the Panasonic phones, this is definitely the most comfortable I've tried. It has a clear sound, and a fairly good micrphone.On the cons side is the durability: I've purchased 3 in 2 years specially because the cord can easily break.All in all: a good product for ocassional use, not a great one for the demans of a work environment, but witht he price it has, its pretty good."
3,Works,Work fine until they get broken. Would look for a better made set if I ever want another set. Don't need them now.
2,Disappointed,"I bought these to use with my cordless phone and I'm disappointed by their performance. I can usually hear the other person fine but I am constantly being told that they can't hear me. When I take the headset off and use the same phone however, they can hear me just fine. I wouldn't buy these again."
2,not what I expected,"I've been through 3 headsets recently since purchasing my new phone. Can't discern whether it's the new phone (which works perfectly without a headset) or the product, but be aware it may be the headset. Callers couldn't hear hardly anything I said."
3,Pleased with the purchase,The Panasonic Hands-free headphone works fine and is good value for the price. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one if needed.
3,Good for sound quality but the cable is not long enough,"I use this for Rosetta Stone because my computer does not have an integrated microphone. These are fine but the cable is just barely too short. It is a major annoyance knowing that I can't move my head. My PC tower isn't even that far away and it's on the ground like an average person would have their setup. The only issue is that the headphone jack is in the back of the PC. a 1.5 foot difference, but it would be nice for these headphone companies to make their cables too long rather than too short. Panasonic is one of the best but this particular model has that one major flaw.-Ken FlemmingAuthor, How to Get a Job in Video Games"
4,"Works very well, and as described","A basic but worthy purchase. Works well with the Panasonic base units, and does its job wonderfully. Comes with a clip and 5 ft of cord length. Definitely worth the price - will buy again."
3,Get used to replacing it often,"This headset is inexpensive and works well, but the plastic frame tends to break after several months unless you handle it very carefully. Still, for the price and sound-quality I would recommend it.Update: I bought one of these headsets in September and by November the plastic frame was broken. To reiterate: these headsets break very easily."
1,Piece of crap,"I realize this was cheap, and you clearly get what you pay for. The earpiece volume was way too loud, almost deafening, with no way to adjust it, yet the microphone part did not work well enough. The only way for someone to hear me speak was for the microphone to literally be resting on my lips. If you think you are getting a good deal on this thing, you are not."
4,Pretty good headset,This is a pretty good headset for the cost. I'm a panasonic fan so I thought I would give it a try to go with my new panasonic phone. I work from home on the phones a lot and this one is prety much at par with my much more expensive plantronics model. The sound is clear and the volume adjustable and the boom is accurate. Me likey. I would buy again. That is all.
4,Can't beat it for the price,"With the recent news stories about cell phones causing cancer I decided that if they're not 100% certain, maybe I should be safe rather than sorry. So, I bought two of these (one for my mom, one for me). I was thrilled to find that it works on my cell phone as well as my cordless home phone. Beyond any worries over cancer, this device makes it much more comfortable and convenient to be on the phone. For under ten bucks, this is a great find."
4,corded headset,A good light product. Versatile. Clear. Down fall: The head set does not adjust to an exact comfort for me (almost a little big).
5,Love It,"Just arrived yesterday and attached to my cordless phone, talking on the phone while on Facebook is great; LOL. It is of good quality, sound is fantastic and very comfortable. BTW, came in original Panasonic packaging"
3,headphone,this is ok for the price although the person on the other end of theline says they do not hear me as loud when I use this .
3,OK for the price,"I have to use a headphone every day to speak with people via cell phone. This headset is comfortable however there are a few glitches. I have an evo HTC and when it rings, most times i have to pull the headset out of the phone and plug it back in before the person can hear me. I also get complaints that the sound quality isn't as good as it could be. It picks up a lot of outside sound."
2,head set,The volume does not adjust high enough to use with my new phones and I have very good hearing. Considering buying a better product.
3,not the best,Clarity in others hearing you was not the best on this headset. I had complaints from people I called!
3,"Great sound, flimsy head band","Bought a ton of these for my office crew. Sound quality is great, but the headbands keep breaking. So we bought more since the price was right."
2,Did Not Work,"I could hear the people who called me, but they couldn't hear me. Also, it was not very comfortableI returned it."
3,OK except for the oil,"Product is OK .My purpose was to check the relief on my acoustic guitars.This kit came with too much lubricant so for my purpose,that factor was a detriment.For a car mechanic it would be suitable."
5,A small book used for generations,This book is a real gem. It has been used by many generations of Christian Scientists. I personally know many people (including family members) who have had extreme personal situations turned around completly by pondering and applying the truths in this amazing little book.Highly recommended.
4,Straight Up Rock and Roll,"When I bought this album, I didn't realize that it was also another release that Russ did with ""the Barnett Dogs"". It becomes obvious that they are on here when you listen to it. Personally it sounds like Russ and the guys had too little artistic, and maybe also productive input on this one, mainly because the tracks have a sketchy sound and it is not as smooth as the other fine releases.Having said that, it is still a fine album... songs like ""Breakdown"" which scored a hit for Russ, as wll as ""Where Do We Go From Here"", and ""here Come's The Hurt"" stand out as very good quality songs that serve as the standardbearers here.My advise? get this album while you can, with the fickle public and the state of the economy, here is something that is enduring. Who knows when it will go out of print again, so don't take the chance!"
3,VERY EARLY 12 inch BLUE NOTE,"This was one of the first long playing LPs that Blue Note records recorded in 1956. Hank's All Stars consist of Milt Jackson, Horace Silver, Doug Watkins,and Art Blakey. This offering should be for people who know what they are getting into. If they are hoping for an improvement in the tone of Bag's vibes from the old LP they may be disappointed. The tunes are pleasent and groovy enough, but some of the solo orders defy logic.----For younger hard boppers Hank's best seems to be ROLL CALL with Freddie Hubbard, DIPPIN' with Lee Morgan, and the quartet session ANOTHER WORKOUT. Also A CADDY FOR DADDY with Lee. Curtis Fuller on trombone is added for 3 of the 5 tracks. All are from the 1960's."
4,Coolmax HD-211-U2 USB 2.0 2.5-Inch External HD Enclosure,"Expedited shipping, arrived on time, easy to install, worked like a charm.Would recommend it.Thanks a lot.OM."
4,Good Visability and excellent Dust Shoot,"I have found the DW 621 easy to use and quick to set debth of plunge. It is easy to see what you are doing and the dust shoot really helps. The Plung spring is a little week and the trigger takes some getting use to, other wise it represnts good value and it should enjoy the durability of my other Dewealt tools."
2,good until switch wears out,"Works great until the switch wears out. The electronic speed control on my unit wore out with very low hours on it. I have a couple other routers that have done 10-50 times more work, and are still going strong. My friendly neighborhood DeWalt repair center fixed it for me. I went to pick it up... $175 for the repair!!! Keep the piece of sh**. $175 to fix a $190 router?!? I did some research, and found out that I'm not the only one with this problem. The electronic circuitry on these units are notorious for failing. I'd suggest a Porter Cable if you want a 2 hp router."
3,Rare music,I got this for my dad as he loved this mans music and got to meet him when he came to Detroit at Dummy Georges in the 1980's. One or two classics from those mellow albums sound a bit wobbly as I guess the tapes they used were not in the greatest shape but unless you can find those LP's and have them transfered this is all thats available.Other than that it sounds pretty good.
4,Bill Doggett and his combo,"I grew up listening to Bill Doggett on 45rpm records from my parents record collection. I was glad to locate this on cd, because it brought back memories of my childhood and my father who has since pass on."
3,A Romance novel dressed up in S-F clothing,"I bought this wanting to read some good science fiction. What I got was, basically, A Romance novel dressed up in Science-Fiction clothing. Its ""Gossip Girl"" meets ""Scooby Doo"" in outer space, with Australian sugar coating.Its an okay read, I suppose. Technically, it has space travel, somewhat sort-of military-ish trappings, robots, and ""ancient alien artifacts"" - but thats really just the painted backdrop. The real guts of the book is the ""forbidden love story,"" the soap opera cast of characters, and the ""Scooby Doo"" mystery.Everything felt so very mundane - there was so very little real S-F in it.Like I said: its an ""Okay"" read. Just don't buy it expecting a ""fast-paced Science Fiction"" story - buy it if you want a ""quirky, Romance novel in space."""
3,Entertaining Sci-Fi with a little romance thrown in,"I think this book would predominantly be appreciated by women Sci-Fi/Fantasy fans, because of the romance angle. The heroine was believable, and I enjoyed the twist of having her be in charge and the ""hero"" be in a subordinate position to her. The Australian/aboriginal folklore was interesting but a little confusing to me as an American reader. The mystery was played out well but a tad bit predictable. OveralI enjoyed it for the romance and the world building."
5,Military Sci Fi At It's Best,"All in all, this book is listed as being in the genre of Military Sci Fi but it also has a mystery at it's heart that unfolds with a beautiful grace. From the writer's standpoint and her writing style, the reader can tell that the author definitely has a flair for writing. The book was so well written that it invited me to keep turning page after page wanting to know what was going to happen next. This book is the start of a series and I am sure I will enjoy each and every book in the series."
1,"Christian trappings, without Christian morals","As a generic book, this would be a fairly well-written piece. Unfortunately, as a work of ""Christian fiction"", i was greatly disappointed with it.The book starts out with a very bad moral choice, and ends with a bad moral choice.Some books can do that, but yet make it clear the choice is wrong. However, this author seems to go out of her way to say the bad choices, were actually the RIGHT choices.That makes it an anti-Christian work to my view. That makes it even worse than a general immoral book, because it presents itself as Christian.Very unhappy with it."
2,think twice,dont believe the guys who wrote well about this product i bet they were hired to write good about it.public
1,Not even worth $12.99,I tried to sleep on these sheets after the first washing. Felt like I slept on sandpaper. Washed again. Felt like I was sleeping on washed sandpaper...that was fraying. These are going back. They don't feel like 300 thread or even Egyptian cotton. These are going back.
4,Purple sheets,I am very pleased with the size and overall quality of the sheets BUT when I washed them in COLD WATER the first time they came out looking tie dyed. They faded in some spots very badly. Still for the money I am very pleased.
1,Bad Sheets,These sheets are not worth your money. The sheets I received had a red stripe down the middle. They also feel like paper.
1,300 - thread-count Egyptian Cotton King Sheet set,The tags on the sheets said to wash before using. I did this and when I put them on the bed the bottom is more like a full or queen size. The top sheet is also rather small. I cannot use this product.
1,Doesn't seem like 300,"I wish I had read the reviews before ordering. I sent these back without using, because the cotton didn't seem like 300-thread count at all. I guess you get what you pay for. Also, be aware: the color of ""rattan"" is a golden brown, kind of like a natural suede color. On my computer, it looked more brown-brown."
1,barf-o-rama,"This book would be given an F if it was turned in as a paper in any college English class. It is poorly organized, repetitive, double-spaced, slow, choppy and devoid of anything that can be referred to as interesting or informative.Did this guy not have a ""spell check"" on his computer? I found one typo minimum on every single page of the book. I'm not even sure if he spelled his own name right.The price for this book is a laugh... but only if you actually spend it. I read a copy at the library and I'm a bit irritated that my tax dollars were spent to buy this coma-inducing bore."
1,A tree died for this?,"I wish that the recently posted reviews giving this book one star had been posted before I bought my copy. I can't do much more than reiterate what has already been said... repitition, typos, and way too pricey for the tiny morsels therein.I struggled through this rambling essay as it was hard to keep focused on finishing it... it rambles, repeats... you get the picture. If I had only paid six bucks for this book, I probably would be more forgiving in the rating, but after getting the shaft by the author/publisher, I figured I'd return the favor."
4,Insight and Informative,"This book took a very candid look at what basic training offers. The information given is very insightful, and is a must read prior to entering boot camp. I would recommend this book to anyone even considering joing the military. The tips and hints provided by the author are essential to a person's success."
3,Not as great as i was expecting,"unfortunately, i am the one person in one hundred that had a bad reaction to these. They made me feel awful & made my depression worse. Although I must admit I only tried them for one night, so maybe those side effects would have gone away after a couple days, but i really don't have the patience to feel even more awful than I already do for another couple days. I'm bummed because all the other reviews were so good & gave me hope."
5,Little Miracle Herb,I have not felt so uplifted in years. I just call it G-D's gift to man's well being.
1,Obsolete,"This software is old, Magellan not longer supports updates so, that is a problem for charts on this region where the waterways change constantly due to shoaling and shifting sand.Is a nice chart that cannot be trusted for navigation,so its use is just very limited,looks nice on the portable gps unit, cannot be transferred to a laptop for larger image because the transfer/install software needed, again, is not longer available.You may find a better use for this amount of money."
1,Cannot get handle parts,"Tea kettle is nice, but you cannot order handle parts. My husband was told by OXO Customer Service that we could not purchase the handle (replaces with one screw) or broken part but could ship the entire kettle for repair. Our shipping costs make it more than its value. So our love affair with OXO products is over. Kettle handle apparently does not 'handle' high heat use. I was in love, now I'm 'in search' again."
4,tea kettle,We love our new kettle. it is stylish and has a great grip.The water heats up very fast and thus is energy efficient.Great product
1,Save your money,"If I could return this game, I would. The gameplay is non-sensical and the graphics are pretty stale by the current standards. Just buy the movie."
3,Ok Game if You Liked The Movie,"The game is designed very well with a beautiful layout of Nakatomi plaza. But the game has many limitations. First, all you can do is shoot the bad guys. No other physical contact is possible. Second, you have to follow the movie to move on to the next scene. And third, The ending is horrible! After all the work you out into it, all you getis a little cinematic at the end. Then the game goes back to the Main Screen. I feel it was a poor attempt to make a game out of a great movie. It can be fun, but I found it more frustrating than anything else."
3,Brohters in Valor:A Story of Resistance,"It was a preaty good book for a childrens fiction book. three boys during Hitlers rule decided that they did'nt like his ideas. so they went behind his back and wrote ""handbills"" about his tactical actions, and were arested."
3,Prophetic Book That Foretold the Coming War,"A surprise attack on a US installation in the Pacific by the Japanese? The US conducting a campaign of ""island-hopping"" to fight the enemy? The Japanese using suicide aircraft to defend themselves? This sounds like a history of WWII but it isn't from WWII but rather a novel written years before. What the author has done is basically use military logic to write a book that details a clash between the US and Japan. Some parts of the book are right on the mark with what would later happen for real in World War II. However, other parts miss wide such as the author having the US use gas as a weapon.As novels go, this book really isn't that exciting. It's main interest is to the historian, both professional and amateur, who is interested in what was foreseen by some people in the 1920's."
4,not bad,"Obviously written before the author (and his training) really understood the signifigance aircraft carriers would have in the war between these two countries (1941 -1945), so a lot of his suppositions are not born out by fact.However, the three biggest objections I had to the volume was 1) the fact of his use of very very long paragraphs to get his point across (some paragraphs would go for two or three PAGES at a minimum); 2) the fact that the volume was/is touted as having predicted the attack on Pearl Harbor (at least a decade before it actually happened) but does not mention an attack there at all in the narrative, and 3) how Japan is protrayed as treating prisoners of war in the novel versus how they actuslly treated them in fact.Is it worth reading- - - yes. Just don't do it to see how history was revealed, but only as it might have been."
4,Reverse order?!,I really liked both stories...but then I am a devoted reader of Linda Howard. They only reason I will not give this a 5 star rating is the fact that the editor put the stories out of order. Read Lady of the West FIRST. Since there is a character that first appears here and then again later in time in Angel Creek.Both stories are quick and totally engrossing reads. Once you start it is hard to put them down.Enjoy!
2,BORING!,"This is an album with an awesome single and 12 fillers. I love the song ""Diary of Jane"", but the rest of the cd is boring. The majority of the cd all has the same tempo, the same dark sound, and there is no excitement in any of the songs. It's not that the songs are competely horrible, they just sound like a typical local band instead of headliners. This cd is NOT heavier than their other ones like everyone says. I think people who rave about ""Phobia"" love Breaking Benjamin and love the new single and are in love with this cd because it's something new by them. In about two more days this cd will never touch my cd player again, and I think the same thing will happen for other people very soon."
3,Fear Phobia...,"As a big fan of BB's first two albums, I found this one to be a little dissapointing. All of the songs sort of blend together in an un-exciting way. There are about 3 songs that I really enjoy on the album, and that is only because they had to grow on me after repetitive play. I think perhaps they have matured in the wrong direction, or not at all."
2,enough to give you a phobia of music,"This album is more or less mediocre and too radio-oriented lyrically and instrumentally. The only song that stuck in my head was THe Diary of Jane, and the softer version of it at the end is good too. There were a few other songs with good chord progressions that I don't remember the names of, but overall I hated the lyrics and the guitar progressions were simply boring. Don't buy this album, or the other Breaking Benjamin CDs. They're not any good."
5,"""Phobia"" is excellent!","""Phobia"" is excellent! Another excellent CD from Breaking Benjamin.Track Listing1. Intro2. The Diary of Jane3. Breath4. You5. Evil Angel6. Until the End7. Dance with the Devil8. Topless9. Here We Are10. Unknown Soldier11. Had Enough12. You Fight Me13. Outro"
4,A bunch of fun for fans,"This game is suprisingly fun, especially for fans of the Predator and Alien movies -- all of the sounds, weapons, and visuals are true to both movies. Multiplayer is good, but not great."
5,"Two thumbs, er claws up!","Alien vs Predator 2 creates an unbelievable environment which emulates that of two of the best Sci-Fi movies, Alien and Predator. The attention to detail and the flickering lights in the dark settings really draw you in and give you an exceptional feeling of being there (especially in a dimly lit room). From what I've been able to determine from some of the game sites is this game will draw you in further with its intermingled story much like Half-Life, Half-Life: Opposing Force and Half-Life: Blue Shift did only this game has all three storys in a single install. You'll get to play the part of the Marine, Alien and Predator in a story that will certainly cross paths. The demo only allows you to play the part of the Marine, and he's neatly equipped with a knife, handgun, machine gun (a shotgun only once you find it) and a nifty hacker device. This game looks to be all its cracked up to be and a little more. I'll give this one two thumbs up and that's based on the demo. Wow."
4,Living room session,"Before anything else is said, it is important to understand that this is a ""living room session,"" recorded around a single microphone. It's something more than an off-the-cuff jam session, but definitely something less than a proper studio album. This is a pro in that you get a nice ""live"" kind of vibe, but a hugely frustrating con in the places where it's painfully obvious that they are not properly miked.The music itself is beautiful. Simple as that.This would be an amazing bootleg (and actually that's pretty much what it sounds like), but for a commercial release it shouldn't be too much to ask to hear everyone clearly."
5,"Best, most easily understandable book he ever wrote.","This was topic for my 2nd oral exam at U of Chicago. Me and a couple of other fellows took turns lecturing on it to each other in preparation for same, to work out a few wrinkles of minor skips in proof which we found.He's a great expositor, and I think this one is his crowning achievement for regular guys like me."
5,Essential for any geometer,"Milnor's writing is, as always, exceptionally clear and concise. Foundational material for any geometry student. Every mathematician should own this. Every geometer should study it."
4,The greatest of Brit singers,Matt Monro left us to young at age 54 with liver cancer. His voice and style is excellent and Sinatra calls him a singer's singer and one of the best. You can't go wrong on a Matt Monro CD. Buy it!
1,6 months later and still a defective TV,"My TV had a big ""spot"" in the middle of the screen, right out of the box. After calling Sharp, they said I could get a refund or a repair and the repair would take 3-4 weeks. After 8 weeks and many phone calls, I said just give me the refund. After 6 months, Sharp finally picked up the TV and said it would take another 4-6 weeks for the refund to be mailed to me!Sharp has the horrible customer service which borders on tortuous or even criminal!"
4,I love my TV,"The picture quality is amazing! There are two down sides to this TV; 1. only 5 inputs of which 2 are for digital HDMI. That pretty much only leaves you with 3...I like to connect my Tivo, DVD, VCR, digital camera and video camera so if you do the math, thats 5 components with only 3 available slots. If there are lights on facing the TV, the glare is terrible."
1,"An unreadable, poorly focused study","Washington's Partisan War is an unreadable, poorly focused study of the militia in the northern states during the Revolution. The author violates a cardinal rule of writing-he does not know quite what to leave OUT. Instead Washington's Partisan War tells of almost every militia muster, movement, skirmish, disbanding, etc. until one is totally lost in a (poorly written) forest of minute details. Context is significantly lacking here, and Kwansy fails to adequately tie in all of his facts to make useful conclusions. While Washington's Partisan War may be useful to some studying specific aspects of the middle states duringthe conflict, this book should be avoided by the general reader for the reasons above, as well as its terrible prose."
3,not so great,I had hoped to use this with the longer handle but find it way too small to work well in that capacity. It might work well with the small handle but the looped end is fairly narrow so not practical for medium to large jobs.
4,"Infomative, but...","I got these on video from the library. Watching it was like you were an apprentice to Merv. Merv is obviously a pro and informative but the quality of the filming was very poor and was really quite boring...a family project perhaps? For the price, the video's/DVD's should be a LOT more professional! However, I am getting ready to reupholster another couch and I have forgotten some of the information I need. If I could find them at a good price, I would buy them!"
1,Hated it.,"The only thing I could do with this is bend nails, drive nails in crooked and cuss at it. I looked at videos and saw people using palm nailers, and they were happy as clams. I, on the other hand, hated it."
2,Wine holder,The holder is okay. But there are no dimensions given in the description. I wanted something that would hold bigger wine bottles and the picture looked like it would. But it doesn't.
4,Another masterpiece!,Antony Campbell provides another excellent book on spirituality!! He is not easy to read without some advanced preparation in Religious Studies; but his books are always written beautifully and provide a great deal to reflect on and absorb.The vendor's service was good - book was in good shape and mail service was prompt.
5,True Divorce Stories,"Before reading this book, I had no clue what divorce really was. I knew the textbook facts, but never the personal perspective of divorce. This book looks like a mundane textbook for a college course, but it's actually a dramatic, fast paced novel. It is the type of book that, once you start reading, you can't put it down. After reading several stories, you realize the complexity of divorces and how tramatic it can be. It helps you to sympathize with those who are divorced or are children of divorced families. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic of divorce or anyone looking for a good book to read in their spare time."
1,Can't review it,The CD jewelcase gripped the CD so tightly that I broke it in two trying to extract it. (expletive deleted).
4,creepy-crawly...,"remember listening to the CD when working some moonlighting shifts in Fayetteville NC at the hospital.havent' listened to this CD is sometime....the 'juxtopos'ition of the cd and fayetteville only makes my giggle...how to describe this album?...dark funky...some like bizzaro splice of sneakerpimps and morcheeba with a sense of humor...the music is creepy and borders on the unsettling at times....and of course i like your tight sweater.....and your new boobs...and your strange trout pout.....this music reminds of the vexing time the late 90's were....albeit, i find 2011 quite vexing as well....but i find myself listening to Orbital..."
2,More misses than hits,"I heard about 4 songs from Moloko through napster, loved what i heard. I eagerly bought the album, ""Do you like my tight sweater?"" couldn't wait to open it up and throw it into my cd player. First track was good, the rest kept getting gradually worse. Great coaster though! The songs I loved were on the second album which is the import. But please, if you like dance music, something that moves ya, even to chill with, don't bother with this one."
3,Not as good as the Sickness,Get the sickness before u get this one. there is not enough songs on this to make it worth the money
2,For fans only,"As a western lover I was quite disappointed by the film itself.It's very poorly directed and the editing is terrible. It's only interest lies in the cast, but then again, they've all done much better stuff."
4,Great Look At The Last Years of Frank and Jesse James,"The James Gang has emerged as one of the most notorious outlaw gangs in American History. For years, Frank and Jesse James stayed one step ahead of the law, and were never caught.Country music superstars Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson are the title characters. Both were pioneers in the country music outlaw movement and play their roles with not only charm but a lot of heart as well. I must say that I've always been fans of their music, and this film is one of the best adaptions of the James tale.We all know how the story ends, and this film takes us about six years before the death of Jesse James and a little while thereafter. Does Frank James get his revenge on the coward that murdered his brother? Just watch and see! Highly Recommended."
2,the tex ritter tound up review dvd,"Have just finished these dvds, found themto be just watchable, lots of little worms floating around the screen , some very dark, some very light,have to stick to a more up to date western series next time .w lester"
3,Good family film,I bought the film for my grandchildern and they enjoyed it. I haven't personally seen it.
1,Kodak Digital Print Paper is Incompatible with Epson Ink,"I have tried Kodak print paper on two different Epson printers - my older Photo Stylus (forgot the model) and my brand new R320. On both of these, the ink appeared to form into little blobs, rendering a TERRIBLE picture. I have had great luck with Fuji and Epson papers. Kodak's claim of compatibility with all printers is BUNK!"
3,Could of been better,"What happens when you put two middle class families, one black and one white, in the same house and in each others skin color? Apparently not a whole lot, nothing really happens in this documentary and utimately no message is conveyed by the end of it all."
2,Not Very Dynamic,"If your idea of CREATING or being DYNAMIC is sitting back and letting a non-conscious part of yourself do all the work, then this might be the CD for you. I had the impression from the title, subtitle, and cost that there'd be information, choice, cognitive intelligence, etc. involved. Not so. Ms. Day's hypnotic voice (beautiful as it is) is combined with Jeffrey Thompson's music to provide, perhaps, a 20-30 minutes of guidance. The author speaks a bit, and then says she'll remain quiet for the rest of a track. The second CD is strictly music...but I already own that CD, as do many people who've been purchasing healing type music over the past few years. This partly recycled product was not worth the $25-$30 cost. I don't think this is a fair deal -- which is particularly disappointing given the subject matter. Guess my intuition wasn't working well when I chose it. Sigh."
1,A Dog that barks all the way home/,This disc is a dog! It barks all the way home!I guess it's safer to stick to the Frank Capra videos.Our Mr. Sun/Strange Case of the Cosmic RaysandHemo the Magnificent / Unchained Goddess. These 4 films are excellent!
3,Paid to much,"Why is a small paperback book so expensive, and not the pattern I wanted. So I guess I am stuck with them"
3,The Basics,Its rather short in length. It covers the basics and seems to be designed for people comtemplating quitting smoking or people who have recently join some kind of smoking cessation program.
3,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH LATE 2005 POWERMAC,i got this for my late 2005 powermac and was disappointed to find that it didn't fit so i had to return it. but honestly the optical port on any mac can blow this thing out of the water.
5,Porter-Cable C5101 15 Amp 1-1/2 Horsepower 20 Gall...,Excellent compressor for the handyman's garage. All the pressure and volume you need. Great bargain for the price.
4,An objective but sympathetic look at Lee.,"I thought this was a personal biography of Robert E. Lee. I think some of the previous reviewers were looking for a military biography. But book talks more about Lee as a man instead of Lee as a military commander. On that, I found the book to be rather refreshing in outlook as the author intregated Lee's personal life into his military performances.The author appears to be pretty sympathetic toward Lee, as a man with many problems at home before, during and after the Civil War. He writes with clarity and with empathy which helped the reader understand what sort of a man Lee was. While an analyical look, I found the book readable, enlightening and well presented."
4,Tighten up now,"Completely overhyped, but still, a great woozey floor filler of a record (for the most part)."
1,I wanted to like this,"It's a shame that the much anticipated release by !!! does not deliver the goods promised by last year's single which is song #8 on this recording. While the production is nice enough, the music is lacking in the creativity department, not to mention the inane lyrics. Very difficult to tell the songs apart. The music rarely journeys outside of the cliched box it resides in."
3,Heart of the dove,I found the book very interesting but was bored in some spots and I liked her vampire series much better.
4,FANTASTIC SERIES,"I'm a serious LA fan. Love Midnight Breed Series… love, love, love it. When I found out two series of hers were being re released I jumped at the VERY CHEAP $3.99 Kindle price and bought all 7, I think. 3 in the Dragon Chalice Series and 3 in the other series that starts with White Lion's Lady. FANTASTIC… ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. I won't go through the whole story as I just can't take that kind of time but I will say you won't be disappointed.Dragon Chalice is a bit fantasy but for the paranormal romance reader you will not miss a bigger paranormal storyline AT ALL. Ms. Adrian writes great characters , great men, great struggle, perfect villians ( had to change from ""great"" lol ) and good femaile heroines. The second Dragon Chalice is my fav but they are all really really good and worth far far more than $3.99 … hurry and take advantage of this crazy price for an awesome series. EXCELLENT."
3,Review of Pioneer DVR-231-S DVD Recorder,The Pioneer DVR arrived in good used condition and everything works. The manual was included. I have used it to record from the TV and it works very well for that function. I wanted a recorder that would copy a DVD which I had produced. I cannot figure how to do that. I don't think it is possible on this DVD recorder.
5,The beautifully crafted debut by ANGGUN !,"This single contains 3 tracks from Snow on the Sahara ( Swatch's european TV advertising campaign) album version, Trouser Enthusiast Kanggaroo juice mix and French version of the song. one listen and you will be hooked!"
4,This Book Leaves You Wanting More.,"Beyond There Be Demons is one of those wonderfully written books that leaves you wanting more. At the same time, it's a gem of a thriller that you won't want to put down, and a wonderful study of the workings of the most concealed parts of the human mind. Jean Hontz has proven herself to be a talented writer who has a wonderful sense of what the reader wants to know, and when is the right time to provide this information. The characters are complex and ring true, and the plot has enough twists and turns to keep you from guessing the ending in advance. Like many really good books, this one leaves the reader with something to think about after the final page is turned. Demons, whatever form they may take, can never be escaped until their victims find the courage and strength to stop, turn, and face them."
1,Poor Packaging,"The guitar is pretty nice looking although I didnt play it due to it being broken in shipping, it had a broken switch, chips in the finish and all the strings had been dislodged from bouncing around in the box. (returned for refund)"
5,How reading can support inquiry-oriented mathematics,"Reading Counts: Expanding The Role Of Reading In Mathematics Classrooms comprehensively considers how reading can support inquiry-oriented mathematics instruction in the classroom. Raffaella Borasi and Marjorie Siegel drew upon findings of a collaborative action research project to offer three perspectives on reading, each of which highlights a different way that reading can enhance the learning of mathematics. Detailed narratives of classroom experiences aptly illustrate each of these three perspectives, showing the range of texts, strategies, and reading practices teachers can utilize to enrich their student's understanding of mathematical concepts. Reading Counts is a highly recommended addition to Teacher Education reference libraries and invaluable text for classroom teachers of mathematics at all grade levels."
5,Beautiful message for young and old,"This beautifully illustrated book wisely introduces children to the concept of how God is in all things and all people. Old turtle's powerful message can be used by people of any faith, and I think the story appeals to people of all ages. I was so touched by it, I bought a copy for myself."
1,Sad game,This game lacked graphics and everything and anything else a good game has....it was so unreal and cheesy. I don't recommend this game at all.
4,Alright,"When I had received this decor, it was kinda small so instead, I put an airstone in it and used it as a mini-bubbler for my fish. :D"
4,Good for back trouble,"This Pilates workout is intended for those who need an extra-gentle Pilates session to strengthen abs and rehab the back. I found it to be an excellent, gentle and safe introduction to Pilates. (Always check with a practitioner first though). I also recommend Allan Menezes Pilates for back pain."
4,For the non-expert this can be a little overwhelming,"This book is well researched and well written. However, if you have just a passing interest in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, or have just begun your reading on the subject, this is not for you. In an effort to solve the mystery of 28 troopers who apparently died in Deep Ravine, but whose bodies are said to have never been found, Michno provides innumerable eye-witness accounts both white and Indian. In the beginning I tried to follow all of them, especially since I had just been to the battlefield, but I soon found it far too cumbersome. Mr. Michno has put alot of work into this, and he deserves recognition for it, however I would recommend this book only for people who already have a very detailed knowlege of the subject. END"
3,Big Question???,"When describing the movement of Custer's battalion, the author states that Custer lead the right wing up to Calhoun Hill and did not go with the left wing down Medicine Tail Coulee to the river. How did he come to this view???"
2,Be Warned-This is NOT like Roller Coaster Tycoon,My twin 7 year old boys love Roller Coaster Tycoon. I was thrilled to see Moon Tycoon - it looked great! We just put it on last night and it was a big disappointment. Its very dark and hard to see what you've built. Its complicated for little kids (and their dad). We lost interest quickly. Its rated E so I thought it was geared to the younger set. It is not.
3,Could be better,"There are a lot of things to enjoy in this game, such as the great 3D graphics which make you feel that you are really on the moon. My biggest gripe is that it is too simple. Once you've played it once or twice it gets boring. There are only a few types of buildings, and your only option is to keep building the same ones over and over again. Adding additional, more advanced buildings would help the game immensely. I would also like to see the colony doing more changing itself, dependent on the kinds of choices the gamer makes. Overall, it is a fun game, but only for a little while. Except in terms of graphics, it really can't compete with games like Roller Coaster Tycoon and Railroad Tycoon."
2,Not a Great Disney Toy,"Budding Disney artists might like this item for a few minutes. The lady talking to the children while drawing drones on and on. She's too fast for little (5 year old) princesses... My daughter lost interest after playing with this item the first time. And, she loves to draw on her own..."
1,Does Not Work,"I installed this game on both of my computers. Both of them are new and far exceed the minimum requirements to run the game. The game will not run on either machine. I can install the program but the game will not start at all. Very disappointing for my 5 year old who was so excited and has been waiting forever to play this game. I sealed the box back up and returned it to WalMart, even though I didn't buy it there. I got store credit which was fine with me."
1,This was not original HP 96/97 ink as it would not work on my PC. I loved the price and the vendor. The vendor was wonderful,The products did not work well in my HP 6940 inkjet printer; it would not print or would double over the image and you could not read it. I returned. The vendor was excellent in providing me a return label and refund. It was a good experience and I wish the ink would have worked because the price was great. Sorry I was unable to use.
3,Too soon to tell,"A middle aged intelligent woman knows better than to think there really is a miracle in a bottle. I am still sticking with the protocols on this product and am hoping. Lets just say I can't say anything bad; feels good, no residuals, no odor. Are my wrinkles gone yet? Too soon to tell.:)"
1,Horrible!,"I wanted to like this product but it burns my skin and makes it peel so much that I can't even go out of the house looking like that. Also, it accentuates the lines around the eyes and actually made me look much older and wrinkly. How can anyone like this. I am going to have to throw it out. What a total waste of money!"
3,"Great graphics, average plot, idiotic dialogue","The graphics are superb, and for a while the game is intense and fun. It quickly becomes repetitive, however, as the enemy casually throws one soldier after another at you from a bottomless supply of thick-skulled morons. Sierra hires fine computer programmers, but must also allow them to write the dialogue rather than hire anyone with an ear for the language. The dialogue is straight from a comic book, and not a very clever comic book. The supposedly flirty conversations between Cate Archer and her bloated partner are particularly stale and stiff. Yes, this is a game, not a movie, but still, the dialogue didn't have to be so imbecilic."
3,How Not to Babysit Your Brother,"It a good chapter book for kids to read and a fun book for them especially for those that have younger siblings. My granddaughter did get the giggles as we were reading it at some of the things the brothers were doing and I knew she was thinking of her and her baby brother. The pictures were funny and helped with the story. But overall, it did not hold her interest as some of her other more favorite books do nor do I think she will want to reread it as much as some of the others."
1,Missing The Point,"As this album shows, Chris Joss is a big devotee of the soul-jazz groove. Unfortunatly, he beats it over the head here, leaving little or no room for the subtle touches and minor flaws that make this type of music so groovy to listen to on your record machine late at night."
2,"Depressing, boring, and disappointing","As a lifelong Frost fan I looked forward to this release and bought it without hearing any of it , but this is a big disappointment.Depressing as hell, I dont know how anyone could listen to this without wanting to commit suicide. I tried to get through the whole album but had to turn it off 3/4 of the way through it.Monotheist has NONE of the uptempo sound of the Frost of old, its all very slow and deliberate, ie: BORING!!!This is too much ART and not enough METAL."
3,Buy the Billy Bands...,"This is a great full body workout and you can do it without the bands, but you will feel lost and kinda stupid doing it without them. I'm ordering mine now."
3,not a cardio workout,"First off, this video is a waste of time if you don't have the Billy bands. It's a strength training workout with some cardio built in and you'll need the bands to get anything from it. If you are looking for an intense cardio workout look elsewhere. I expected 'fat blasting' to mean advanced cardio and was disappointed. I hate standing still and doing bicep curls and tricep extensions when I could be sweating. You will get a good upper body workout, but it didn't make me sore like the Ultimate bootcamp did (essentially the same video with different moves)."
4,This is a fine book-- you guys are missing the point.,"I strongly disagree with the negative reviews above. I thought ""Even the Wicked"" is one of the best Scudders, and Block is taking the character into a new phase of his life. Courageously, Block has let Scudder age; now we see him, in his late 50's, having come to terms with many of the midlife issues he faced in ""A Long Line of Dead Men."" He's a more balanced, more thoughtful man than he was in the earlier books. Beyond that, Block has come up with a truly interesting, original motive for one of the two central murders. I'm looking forward to the next Scudder; as far as I'm concerned, the line points up."
1,This is Lawrence Block?,"I've read great reviews of this books and this is the first one I picked up. I was greatly disappointed. I was right on every aspect of this ""mystery"" dozens of pages before the ""answer"" was revealed. I look for a lot more from a good book. Perhaps I'll read another Block one day but I feel I've been burned and there are so many other good authors to try. I think it will be quite awhile before I'm back."
2,This book made me deeply sighed again....,"Since the A LONG LINE OF ...,the wonderful creation line was suddenly broken, this one further proved that Block has changed like Lawrance Sanders started teasing readers with his ridiculous and light-wt McNally series, he's just falling in love with his teasing Burglar series. Like Robert Parker's Spenser series, Block should have long quitted after he wrote THE DEVIL KNOWS..., A WALK AMONG..., A TICKET TO..., and A DANCE...plus the earlier ones, these were the best creations by Block, we, the readers, should send flowers to Block to thank him for a wonderful and satisfying reading experience but should also remind him not to ruin our good taste any more, he's already used up his M.S.G."
3,Two mysteries for the price of one :)),"Scudder continues to deliver the goods, but at times seems to be only a shadow of the man he used to be. Still, this is a good read and actually concentrates on two (non-related! ) mysteries. The final page is heart-breaking, sincere and even this coldhearted reviewer felt a leeeetle bit of sting in his eyes! This contrasts nicely with earlier Scudder novels, which usually ended on a blunt, bleak note and goes to demonstrates the meaningfullness of the hard-boiled PI's new life. Good stuff!"
4,"Great Remixes, but one flaw...","I bought this after lengthy consideration, and I'm a bit disappointed. Why? The remixes are very good; in my opinion, they really are an improvement from the original, one of only a very FEW that I consider somewhat mediocre by the boys. So, why? Well, I bought it with the notion that these were all FULL Length, not edits. Well, the first and the last remixes are just that; edits, both cut more than 3 minutes from their originals. Even worse, those two are the BEST remixes on the CD. The second one is good, too.So, in spite of how great they are, I slag this off due to the edits. And I'm still a bit confused on how to classify a ""remix"" CD single that's a mere 20 minutes (EXACTLY) in total length."
5,Beautiful,This may be my favorite of all Edward Gorey's books. It's sad and beautiful; what might have been... I'm so glad it's back in print.
4,Like having sheer curtains,"Achieved privacy and sunscreens, only the edges tend to curl, even though I sewed the outer edge over to prevent any chance of fraying."
4,Damaged,"They are probably the best Australian metal band at the moment. There music is fast, heavy and really f$%#*@g cool. Some of their earlier stuff is just as good but this album is awesome."
5,wonderful cook book,"Gave this to my new daughter-in-law as a gift and she loves it. She and my son have used it to cook together and though I haven't seen it, she says the book has taught her so many things she wanted to learn. This is a great purchase for new brides AND just new cooks."
1,Bait and Switch,"I ordered 3 videos called ""The Las Vegas Abductions"" and I was sent ""Aliens invade Las Vegas"". A few weeks earlier I ordered 6 on ""The Las Vegas Abductions"" and the same thing happened. They advertise ""The Las Vegas Abductions"" and they bait and switch to another semiliar video. The movies are very similiar but they are a little different and the titles are different. Also, the vidoe container with a picture and descreption of the movie was different. I was very dissatisfied."
4,Jazz Montage,"Although not normally a fan of compilations, I picked up this CD for 4.99 used, because I loved the title. The cover features photos of the albums from which the songs were selected; These covers in themselves are indeed Works of Art. What you will be listening to here is very high-quality jazz; from real artists, not money-makers. One Night in Houston is be-boppity/smooth; shows H-town's upside. Come to Find and If you Don't Want Me are bluesy renditions that complement the jazz flavors nicely. Mirror Puzzle is a tour-de-force for Akagi, sublime in texture: sounds like mirrors. I intend to purchase Works of Art both 1 and 2, in hopes of even more enjoyment."
5,You Sure Can't Take His Blues,"Simple blues music, with simple lyrics. Doesn't sound like a good recipe for a ""five star"" rated album, right?The edge comes from MacLeod's passionate performance, which makes the tunes and the lyrics stick hard inside you head. This album puts MacLeod in the very short list of ""the Blues Masters"".Exceptional recording quality gives this CD an additional edge when played through high quality hi-fi."
1,poor recording quality,What a disappointment that the record quality is so poor. The instruments drown out the singers. Their voices are recorded with slight echos and are far too faint to enjoy the strength of tenors.
3,"Well researched, yet personalized and readable.","This is a well written and carefully researched account of the history of USS Rowan, from the early 1940's (before the U.S.declaration of war)through her sinking by Nazi submarines off the coast of Italy. The story is told chiefly by Lewis Seeley, who was Ship's Cook First Class at the time of the sinking, but reveals familiarity with a broad spectrum of the activities that make up everyday life aboard a fighting destroyer. Anyone having an interest in Navy matters would enjoy the tale, but I found it especially revealing because I later served with Lewis Seeley aboard another destroyer, just after the war ended. Then Chief Commissary Steward Seeley was every bit as conscientious and thorough in performing beyond his assigned duties aboard that ship as was revealed in the Rowan story. Yet he kept that story to himself the whole time I knew him. I'm glad that he now has revealed it and I salute him for all he has accomplished"
5,This book touches so many lives...,"You've read the glowing reviews that other readers have posted here, and they capture so much of my own experience with this engaging, well-told story. This book brought a needed closure to so many people who were directly affected by the events it depicts so well. But its timeless story also ripples through so many other lives, and likely will for many years to come. In my own case, my father began his career at sea as a cadet in the US Merchant Marine during that war, but he always had very little he would say about his experiences of those turbulent days. My heartfelt thanks to Ms. Buell for giving me such a poignant glimpse into my father's times..."
4,The demos were better...,"This was a really really really great band. The shows were unpredictable and high energy. A lot of talent floated in and out of this circle, infusing it with industrial/synth/punk elements.Be sure to check out Idiot Stare also. And visit the bands website. BodyBag productions. You can get the demos there which really were better, more raw than the cd released."
5,I'd forgotten how good this was!,"Despite the fact that they sold out to a major label DRI were a beltingingly good HC/Thrash/Punk band. This record was never off my turntable way back then, and the fact that bands like Despise You have covered material from this era (Couch Slouch) show that DRI's early music is still good enough to mix it with the cutting edge of extreme music. If you don't want to give your money to DRI or the big corporations then seek out a freind who has this record so you can go round to their house and listen to to this esential thang! DIY not DRI!"
5,You Just Don't Know,"This album... well, you know.Something most of are forgetting (or just don't know)... Sammy does most of the hardcore vocals.I was fortunate enough to see Acid Bath live in Shreveport, La. (One of their very last shows... I consider myself blessed)."
4,"great book, terrible binding","I'm using this book for a quilt making class that I'm taking. My classmates and I all really enjoy the book, but by the second day of class, every single one of our books was falling apart, pages coming right out of the bindings.If you're serious about using this book, consider taking it to Kinko's and getting it spiral bound. Otherwise, you'll be missing half of the pages within hours of opening the book for the first time."
5,Absolutely Phenomenal!!!,"What else can you say about the best heavy metal band on the planet? To have Megadeth's original album digitally re-mastered with original song demos included as bonus tracks is a dream come true. Megadeth has done such a great job restoring the original recordings to digital standards that this album sounds as if it was just recorded! I would recommend this album to any Megadeth fan or anybody that would like to witness first hand the birth of Thrash Metal the way it was meant to be heard. This recording features the original Megadeth lineup of Dave Mustaine, David Ellefson, Chris Poland, and Gar Samuelson. Rest in peace Gar. You are part of a legacy that will never be forgotten."
1,You are all brainwashed!,"(...) The sound quality still sounds horrible, I don't know what the big deal is.Megadeth has always been a sorry excuse for thrash metal, but their debut is absolutely, hilariously, horrible. If you want good, quality, non-panzy metal, stick with old Metallica, Hypocrisy, Black Sabbtah, Ozzy Osbourne, Pantera, Slayer, etc."
1,WHAT THE????,"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? If I read it right it said HISTORY OF THRASH METAL!!! HOW DID NOTHING ELSE MATTERS GET IN THERE?REALLY BAD IDEA FOLKS, REALLY."
3,"Good Album, but not as good as the previous Enigma releases","Overall, this was a good album. Songs like ""Boum Boum"", ""Look of Today"", ""The Piano"", and ""Following the Sun"" made me want to get it. But compared to MCMXC A.D., The Cross of Changes, Lei Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!, and The Screen Behind the Mirror, it just doesn't work as well. Still O.K. though."
1,Not the worst cd I've heard,This is not a CD that follows the flow set by the first 4 CDs. This is the only Enigma CD that I don't like. I'll play 1-4 straight through and skip this last CD.
1,"""Why?...""","This latest album from Enigma is dissapointing in every way. None of these tracks contains the enchanting gregorian chorus that we used to hear in other albums and which, in my opinion, gives the spiritual richness to Cretu's compositions. In addition, we can't find any song like ""Silence Must Be Heard"" , ""I Love You, I'll Kill You"" or ""Why?"" which makes us discover the dephts with their beautiful melodies and moving rhytms... What's left is a superficiel music that doesn't satisfy our expectations from Enigma..."
2,VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF MY CD COLLECTION,"Good heavens. What the hell is Michael Cretu doing with Enigma? During the intro we got the usual horn piece and then the song kicks in and everything sounds pretty good but then the album quickly goes downhill after that. Yes, that quickly the album disintegrates. The vocals are so awful you can't understand what anybody is saying. There are no more signature enigma sounds such as the pan flutes and monks singing in the background. Now, it's just a bunch of weird computerized noises. What happened to sandra? And get the monks back in the studio!"
1,Absolute disappointment - BEWARE!,"I am a huge fan of Enigma and have all four of their previous albums, which are absolutely excellent. This is why I was so disappointed with this one. It is random and directionless and much of it sounds like individual band members tuning up. The entire album is pervaded by a supremely annoying, harsh, distorted electronic sound that grates on the ears. It seems to me that in this music Michael Cretu has become a modern-day German full of Angst and self pity that no one could care less about. Boredom and annoyance are the two lasting impressions of this album."
2,Dull CD,"I enjoy listening to Enigma, especially the earlier works. But this CD isn't worth spending .99 cents for a song. I was checking out the songs on iTunes prior to just buying a CD and it wasn't worth spending any money on it. I'm glad that there is a service that let's you preview all the tracks before getting stuck with an album that will be used as a frisbee. I think only people that worship Enigma will enjoy this CD, I'm sorry, but I couldn't."
3,almost lost enigma,"This album is different. I can't believe I spent 15 bucks on this cd. Well, it's nice to hear engima again but i think it's time to go on to a new search for new enigma music out there."
5,Excellent! No better than this new style!,"I haven't been one to really appreciate the words of others whenthey praise music because usually it's such a matter of personaltaste but in this case I have to make a special exception. Thisis kick ass music that is just not able to be passed up! Itscreams for you to listen to it more. Even more so it is justthis feeling of having no reason to listen but listening anyway,that enables us to feel what he is saying. This feeling requiresno effort from the listener, just a few listens to get the gistof what Michel Cretu was trying to express. He does away withthe sampling of the past CD's, this time settling for abeautiful arrangement of guitars and strange sounds you'llwonder about."
1,"As Advertised, but Useless","Software was exactly what they said it was - an ""older version."" So old it wouldn't work on a Mac running OSX. Oh well. It was cheap enough to be worth the experiment..."
1,Write a review a year after your purchase,"Here I am, a little over a year after my purchase, and the CD changer won't read a CD! It started months ago...every once in a while I'd get a ""No Disk"" error. Now it's rare that it will read a CD at all! I used a can of spray air to clear any dust that may have accumulated on the sensor....to no avail. I would never buy RCA again. Just as I won't ever buy Durabrand again. These products don't even last a year. Not worth it!!"
4,"Good ladies, very good...","Id just like to say that this is a kick ass album(excluding a couple of dodge songs, namingly the ones with no lyrics!!!) an its well worth a try for anyone into Midtown. Although the tracks arn't exactly hugly different to one another, I still found ""Forget What You Know"" to have enough strength an origionality to make it to my cd player over an over again. Enjoy, guys!"
2,Forget what YOU know-This is NOT Midtown at their best....,"I bought this album expecting to like it because I like Midtown. I was highly disappointed in it. First off, it sounds NOTHING like Midtown, but in a bad way. The sound varies so greatly between the songs, I almost begin to believe that I'm listening to a compilation album. It's almost like they couldn't decide how the band should sound, so they just threw some stuff together to make songs. Secondly, the lyrics are pretty lame. Take just a minute to listen and you'll know what I'm talking about.Midtown have changed, and for the worse. For fans of their previous albums (Living Well..., ...Lose the Girl, etc.) I don't recommend this album at all."
1,I always knew they were scene chasers,"Man, i was really amped for this album - but its just not very good at all. I really dig the single, ""give it up,"" but the rest of the record is so phony and lame. None of it is honest at all, the lyrics sounds so incredibly forced like they realized a more 'dramatic' sound was getting popular and they needed to write 13 songs based around the same 5 vocabulary words in mismatched and completely non-sensical orders. Its all just so incredibly fake, and if you ever get the chance to see them live you can literally see the falsity; its like a frat boy fashion show. It just sounds like Gabe sat in his room and played his favorite Creed records over and over until he popped 13 songs dramatic enough to entrench him in some 'salvation.' Oy, anyway, don't waste your money. If you feel the need to spend some cash look into the new modest mouse record or the joey cape/tony sly acoustic split - both fantastic records. Okeedokee, laters."
2,The only thing worse than a band selling out...,"is a band selling out to a MAJOR LABEL and STILL being called the ""lesser known"" of their genre. Fed up with being unknown, Midtown decided they would backstab and abandon the Drive thru label, and in doing so quickly got a deal with sony. The result was a below average (at best), generic rock album, with not so catchy songs and nothing to make it stand out among the crowd (aside from shock-value song titles like ""god is dead""). another year or two with DTR would have probably gotten them the fame they so wanted, but instead, they opted for an easy escape and lost on all counts i.e. this is hardly the kind of ""success"" a major label like Sony records expects...Don't count on a sophmore sony record from these guys, cuz just like zebrahead, they'll be shown the door faster than you can say ""SELLOUTS!!!!!!!!!""...."
1,The Man In This Book Is Kind Of Schmucky!,"I love Christmas romance books but I was disappointed with this one, it was just another dull romance book filled with misinterpretations and misunderstandings and just another romance book where the arrogant hero treats the heroine very shabbily. I like a hero who is macho but macho doesn't have to mean that he has to be rude and arrogant! Jon was too grouchy for my taste and I always wonder why it seems that a lot of women who read romance books find grouchy guys so appealing and I wish I could give this book a lower rating then 1."
4,It works!,I used the product to kill moss on my roof. It doesn't change the color of the shingles (as would chlorine bleach) and it doesn't harm plants below (in modest doses). It appears to have worked well. It needed to be applied in strong conentrations (1/2+ cup per gallon).
3,its ok,i like using this on my cloth diapers. I could not get stains out in regular clothes like I thought I would be able to. Maybe i'm doing it wrong? I dont know but its nice to have on hand rather than regular bleach.
5,better than bleach,"This stuff works so well on my laundry, that I started using it for cleaning stubborn stains around the house (in the carpet shampooer, washing away mildew in the shower, cleaning dog doodie area in the back yard, etc) but even if you only use it for laundry, you'll be SO glad you tried it. It works WAY BETTER than bleach ever did, without the harsh wear and tear on your clothes. I've removed stains that I thought would NEVER come clean by making a paste and putting that paste directly the stain for a few hours before washing.... this method removed both coffee and lipstick stains that had already been washed AND DRIED into the fabric! It's unbelievable that it works so well, and nobody seems to know about it. But one thing is for sure... I'll never use anything other than this bleach!"
4,Facing Hard Facts,"I'll be brief. This book is an outstanding work, reflecting genuine scholarship and wide ranging research. I found it painful to read. Why? The experience is somewhat like seeing O. J. Simpson credibly accused of murdering his ex-wife. One of the idols of one's youth is shattered before your disbelieving eyes. But the authors make a convincing case.Astronomy and cosmology receive very light treatment. I suppose if you are not aware of the roles of Tycho, Kepler and Copernicus in revolutionizing astronomy, this is not the place to start.I think anyone interested in the history of astronomy needs to read this book, but only after one is aware of the larger history of cosmology.Why only four stars? There is a certain lack of coherence that might have been remedied with better editorial review. In addition conciseness seems to spill over into misstatement in places."
2,It's a great display gun and that's about it .,"When I first bought this gun I thought it was cool shooting it in the backyard, but when I went against a friend he beat me using a mini [...]."
4,excellent,"Embryo is a little bit different than most German progressive bands from the 1970s, grouped as Kruatrock.For about forty years, this band, led by Chritian Boucher, have made a tight art funk--subtle in its sophistication and lacking the more fleshed sounds of Can, Kraan, or Gomorrha.At times this music sounds just a bit brittle, but on Bad Heads and Bad Cats, the sound is bolder, rounded by a female singer and lush trantions from track to track.Charile Mariano, who worked with Mingus in the early 1960s, did sax work for these funky Auslanders, a testement to the talent and class of Embryo.Reccomended."
1,"Not Jazz, but junk...","I don't listen to a lot of pop music, and I mistakenly thought that Diana Krall's new husband would also be a jazz musician. Well, obviously, he isn't. I'm not even sure what kind of musician he is, or if he even is one. This is just a terrible cd. His voice is horrible, which is bad, because he is a singer of some kind.Opposites attract, indeed!"
3,Not as cozy as it looks..,I ordered this for my unborn son when it was on sale expecting a supersoft blanket with medium thickness. It arrived and turned out to be a pretty thin material that was not nearly as soft or cozy as it appears in the picture. It does have instructions and a couple of snaps for swaddling but you could do that with any recieving blanket or otherwise.
3,not sure it's a good idea,"This dictionary, as its title implies, has the Korean words alphabetized as they would be under the Roman alphabet. I bought this dictionary, but I quickly outgrew in favor of a hangul dictionary. I hope that you will, too. If you quickly outgrow this dictionary, you will have wasted your money.If you DON'T quickly outgrow this dictionary, you will get in a bad habit.Perhaps it would be better for a student of the Korean language to set good habits from the start."
1,Hot Sticky Mess,"This is too sticky as a massage oil and the consistency and flavor are not appealing for oral. It is sticky while using and when you are finished, taking some thorough washing off to get rid of the sticky mess."
5,Dirty Rotten Imbeciles first CD,"Hyperfast pissed off hardcore punk with loads of rabid guitar shredding. The big bonus it has a sense of humour unike the relentless, finger wagging Sociology lecturer type harangues of Pennywise, Ignite etc. Why doesn't just one band play like this today?"
2,An early prototype,"Rage are one of those bands that seem to produce one of two reactions, either great loyalty or total apathy. My personal take is that both views are understandable.With this album - one of their earlier efforts - the latter is my viewpoint. The songs belt along and are quite well played. The vox are an acquired taste but certainly no worse than many other bands have, and they are at least mixed above the music, some of the early thrash bands not being able to afford decent production values and falling into a vocal no mans land.With this album Rage started to gain some momentum, the guitar playing is biting, the intent clear - these guys want to level the room. The snag is that the songs tend to wash over the listener without really grabbing hold.Of this bands early output - I'd have to recommend prospective buys skip this disc and instead buy Secrets in a Weird World instead as the songs on that disc have more connectivity with the audience and a slightly more human feel."
3,Ok for a little girls game...,"Ok for a little girls game, but it's nothing that spectacular! Depending on the age of the child, it can be a little difficult at times. But, overall ok!"
3,The female equivalent to the traditional macho gumshoe,"The plot is quite fascinating, bringing together strands from history, contemporary politics and a love for the streets of Paris. But Aimee Leduc is too good to be true: a brilliant sleuth, with wide connections in French politics, physically tough, beautiful, resourceful, imaginative and a talented computer hacker. Not quite believable."
3,A B-List Jeeves,"The late Mr. Sanders owes a great deal to P.G. Wodehouse whose Jeeves stories are the style source for Archie McNally, Palm Beach playboy and scion in a stuffy law office. Sanders enjoys the same deft wordplay and skewed insights that make Jeeves and Bertie such a pleasure to follow. This novel has a colorful set of characters ranging from louche to larcenous and a nimble plot. It even has a Pelicans (read: Drones) Club where, as expected, the staff is brighter than the membership. A fast read and diverting."
2,You've already known the scam & victim before started,"The problem of McNally's series is that when you read along, the scam, the conmen, the murder and the victim are all so clearly put on Sanders' buffet table, you just walk along to taste them with the flavours you're already too familiar. The 19th century's character, McNally, is just a guy who can't stop all the bad things happening but to predict even manipulate them to happen in accordance with what he(or you, the reader) already so readily ascertained. This is the worst kind of mystery written for brain dead people. If a story you've already known WHO, WHAT, WHEN, HOW, THEN...SEE? I'VE ALREDY TOLD YOU IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOONER OR LATER LIKE THIS. Then, it's just a toilet literature for those who got nothing to do with their lives."
3,"Good, but not great","I have read all of the McNally books and did not think ""Gamble"" was as good as the others. Somewhat predictable, actually. Sanders' other efforts had more suspense and moved along quicker. In ""Gamble"" the plot and culprits were clear very early in the narrative and in my opinion, left little to the imagination. ""Gamble"" left me wanting more, while the others were more satisfying. Still, there is much to like about Archy. Even with all his swimming, he must weight 300 pounds!"
3,The Opening Round - Houston Person,"First tune is great!!! The rest of the tunes are so, so. Joey De Francesco made the rest of the CD listenable."
4,Replacing an old fav,"I listen to this album for any number of 'quiet times'--rain or shine, alone or with others, busy or not. It's just a nice backdrop. Mellow is the operative word here with a nice variety of lead instruments and not too much of any one thing. I'm a big fan of the ""Jazz for the..."" series and this one is my 2nd favorite."
3,Gorgeous designs but...,"This project book includes 3 main chapters:Samplers and scenes (very nice ones),home projects (throw,cushions,linen,...)and baby projects (badges,blanket,rug,...). The designs range from very basic to more detailed work and are really nice. The reason why I'm not giving this book 5 stars is that the pattern charts (which are an integral part of such a book) of the more complicated big designs are very small,difficult to read and follow and very eye-straining. The charts being in black and white doesn't help."
4,Works well.,"Its pretty simple, but sturdy and effective. You can even continue to use the sliding ""hold"" switch."
4,Far but not far enough...,"Far Frontier is all new stories from 2000, short stories about what is just beyond the barriers of our knowledge. What is just out of reach, just around the corner? Aliens? A new planet? A new way of life? New lands, ideas and technologies await us if we are willing to dare. Such authors as Jane Lindskold, Alan Dean Foster and Robert J. Swayer will pull you in with their skill, imagination and hope for the future. But many of the stories don't really hook you as they could. This is a bus or plane book. Get it used or new."
5,smooth and alive gentle Jazz,"very easy listening from a talented and lovely lady and her trio. Will play at San Mateo College ""Jazz on the Hill"". Nice rendition of Pete Seegar's KUM-BAY-AH in melodic light Jazz."
1,Do not waster your money,I just received mine today from another vendor and it is going back tomorrow.Chisels will not align properly. The tiny hex head screw that hold the tightenign knob on thescrew is stripped. It's junk.
4,a good mystery read,"This was an interesting book by Nancy Taylor Rosenberg. It was a good read and i enjoyed the characters and the plot.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
1,This stuff is garbage!!,"I just tried this beef jerky. The expiration date was 3/09, but this stuff is the worst jerky I ever tried (there was no way I could actually eat this). It was so dry that it was beyond description. The taste was very, very smokey. So smokey that it seemed that a gush of liquid smoke filled my mouth when my teeth finally started to soften this hardwned leather a little. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
4,Push-Pull Weeder AKA a deluxe Hula-Ho,If you are looking for a better built Hula-Ho then you have found it. If you need a narrow version of the Hula-Ho or this Push-Pull Weeder you may want to check out the Telsco Weeder.Gardening is a hobby for me and weeding has always been the less desired part of it; so treating myself to a few nice weeders and tools make the hobby more fun for me.
4,Useful,The 2nd Ed is still very useful even though it is 5 editions old. All the photos are very detailed & it has definitely helped me do well in Anatomy & Physiology II.
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Rather disappointing dragging out of the affair, after a promising start. In amidst warring planets, a woman is attempting some diplomacy. As such, she gets dragged into an alien culture, its social mores, problems, treatment of the genders and all those other issues.The main character, Paula, has to be strong to survive."
4,Amazingly helpful,I have been using my wedge for a month now (currently 5.5 months) and can definitely tell the difference. The best part is the back support. I still use a regular pillow between my knees. The only drawback is if you change positions you have to re-adjust the wedges. I also use them as a foot support (stack one on top of the other) while watching TV etc. I highly recommend this product.
3,Disregard the 1-star review if you aren't a dub novice,"3.5 Stars.Much like the second reviewer said, this is NOT a rip-off cd, it's a real LP from the 70's. There is some good dub on here for those who have dove into dub a little deeper than some. Good heavy thumping bass, good mix of horns, keys, guitar and vocals. And as far as the sound quality goes, sure there's some hiss of the actual vinyl (which some really like), though it's not noticeably present the whole album or to degrees that detract from the music at all, especially if you've heard some of King Tubby's Declaration of Dub or even some of the Prophesy of Dub or a number of rare dub releases. If you've listened to some really rough sounding dub (usually more rare releases) then this won't sound that bad at all.Now that being said, sure there is much more ""essential"" dub out there if you're new or even fairly new to the genre, but for those who's collections are deepening/expanding this is a fine addition."
4,Very Helpful!!,Lots of details for the beginner OR for the experienced user trying to learn a few new tricks!!
3,A playboy indeed.,"The McNally series is turning out to be something less than I expected. It is proving a let-down after having waded through the four deadly sin novels by the same author. Maybe the series will improve with age. If you still want to read, get the books in paperback. Otherwise borrow them from the local library.One of the major merits of this series is that it is written from the perspective of the playboy himself rather than the perspective of a third person. And it also has the advantage of providing a different viewpoint on the pompus rich."
4,Great for hot climates,"This T-shirt is as ""normal"" as you will find for nursing clothing. I love that it doesn't have two layers. Other tops with double layers are just too hot for the Texas climate. The zippers are a little odd, but not very noticable. I wish it was available in more colors."
1,"Great, as long as you don't put anything in it.","I bought this cart to take to art shows to keep my things organized, but am being forced to abandon it after just 3 shows. It works great as long as you don't put anything in the drawers. If you add any weight at all, the plastic bows and the drawers keep falling out of the slots. One drawer has nothing but one roll of duct tape, a pocket knife and a bag with 10 or so clothes pins. Another has nothing but a small calculator, a few receipt books and a few pens. This is more than these drawers can handle. If you plan to store anything more than a bag of feathers, don't waste your money."
4,"Kiske, not Helloween",Fans of Helloween should not expect to hear Michael Kiske doing his Geoff Tate impersonation on his own projects. Kiske has a great voice and it is refreshing to hear him using in his own style. I feel this is one of his stronger efforts away from Helloween.
5,Sanders would have loved it . A great book.,"Just finished reading this newest offering in the Sanders series. Yes, it is true that it's not written by the Lawrence Sanders who captivated us throughout the McNally books, but it is an equivalent (and better in many respects). Mr. Lardo captures Sanders' voice and wit superbly.As others have written here, I too find it peculiar that Putnam Publishing has chosen to keep Mr. Lardo's identity a secret. He also authored (under his own name) The Hampton Affair (also published by Putnam), which I found to be a great read. The book is set in the swanky Hamptons of Long Island's ""East End"" (ala Palm Beach) where money, sex and murder prove to be fertile subject matter. I highly recommend both books. Just my thoughts!"
2,Not written by L. Sanders - misses the mark by a mile,"This book, written 2 & 1/2 years after L. Sanders death has a number of major flaws. If you know Archy, and his world, you would know that his father would not have had an affair with Lady Cynthia, that L. Sanders would not have used a historical event like the sinking of the Titanic as part of the plot and that Archy would not be thinking of marriage after 24 hours of meeting a woman.There are a few smiles along the way, but the characters in this McNally step child are not the characters I enjoyed in the previous installments."
2,READER BEWARE!,"After reading the first chapter, I looked very closely at the copyright page, and lo and behold! It was NOT written by Sanders, but by a different author under Sanders name. Thought so. Fans of Archy and his Palm Beach life will see the difference right away. Towards the end of the book, the style changes again- almost as if Sanders himself wrote the last half. Weird."
2,lawrence sanders is dead?,ok i knew something was wrong. i had never loved the archy mcnally series before because i believe that the deadly sin novels were lawrence sanders' best work but i had ENJOYED them well enough. this one just didn't work and now i know why. he didn't even write it! i knew the murderer and motive well before the middle of the book and ended up reading the end to confirm it. and voila. if you're new to sanders read the first second etc.. deadly sin novels. p.s. i agree with the movie casting mentioned in one of the reviews except for betty white as mama mcnally. i'm not sure who should do it but i don't see her as being right.
3,A story of deceit and greed.,"As the founder of Discreet Inquuiries, Archy McNally has a new case. Archy is on the case of John Fairhurst III, one of the richest men on the beach. He is also secretly on the case of Geoffrey Williams, who has been murdered by his wife, Melva. Archy has two motives. One, to find the person blackmailing Fairhurst. The second, is to become closer to Veronica, Melva's daughter, who Archy must take care of for Melva. This story is one of deceit and greed. It runs on like a soap opera. Yes, it is somewhat boring at times, but I suggest that you read McNally's Dilemma by Lawrence Sanders."
3,"Not the best, but good.","Archie McNally, once again, finds himself in the thick of things in Palm Beach. A beautiful woman, a murder, and a whole lot of money are the usual fair. The twists in this book are not as twisty as other McNally stories, and this one is unusually predictable. Even so, it is a fun trip into a world few of us know intimately."
3,So So McNally story,"It was only by reading the fine print that I learned that this novel was Not by Lawrence Sanders. For me Archy McNally will always remain the creation of Mr. Sanders, but I wanted to read another story about one of my favorite characters. The attempt by Vincent Lardo gave an interesting slant to McNally, but his style of writing wasn't the same as Mr. Sanders. For the first time, it was clear how the story would evolve, and that's another indication that Lawrence Sanders did not write this book. In my opinion, Mr. Sanders name should not be on the cover, for it's a total disservice to the legacy of this great writer."
1,Missed It By That Much,"Vincent Lardo tried, but he couldn't do it. Archie's wit and sartorial splendor, his father's dry personality, the atmosphere at the Pelican Club were sorta there, but everything was out of focus. I have enjoyed Lawrence Sanders for years, from the Deadly Sin and Commandment books through the McNally series, but I believe I have bought my last one."
5,Joyva Marbled Halvah,It was so wonderful. We are not able to buy this in the stores here in AR. I grew up in ND and you can buy it in the grocery stores. This is great stuff. It melts in your mouth and makes a great dessert. My husband who had never eaten this product before has love it from the minute I handed him a piece. Was so glad to see it on Amazon.com
3,It's OK,"Arrived on time and in good condition. As another reviewer had talked about how cheesy the metal connector was between the ocarina and leather lanyard, I took that off right away and unbraided the the leather, cut it in half and connected that directly to the ocarina and it's working out fine.It takes some getting used to as the holes are huge and I have small hands. It sounds all right, but is very airy on the high notes; going to take a lot of practice to use. Also no fingering chart is included and if you ask about one, they try to sell you Mel Bay's Fun with the Ocarina (which I have, but it is for a C ocarina, not G--still looking for a G chart). Also the holes are reversed on the bottom of this one from the way they are on my C)For the price, I guess it's okay, but I'm going to be checking into Focalink ocarinas for a soprano G as they are much smaller and easier for someone with small hands."
