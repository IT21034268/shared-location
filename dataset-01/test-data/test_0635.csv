3,I Like it a Little Too Much,For some reason this movie always got to me...it has little to do with the first two Excorcist Movies...but it is unique nonetheless. Stellar performance by George C. Scott--if you don't want to see this film at least see it if you're a fan of his work. You will enjoy the unique story and wonder a little more the next time you visit the nursing home.
2,Would not buy this one again.,"My daughter is studying for the asvab test, so we bought her several books and this CD Rom. Was very disappointed with it. The words it has in the language and and comprehension section is NOT even close to what is actually on the ASVAB test. The other books we bought have been great, but I would not recommend this CD Rom at all! It was a total waste of money and time."
1,Perfect Posture: The Basis of Power,"At 36 pages it is a real stretch of the imagination to consider this a ""book"". Considering how often the author references his other book (The Colgan Power Program) this book reads more like a sales brochure designed to get you to buy the power program.As near as I can tell this ""book"" is part of a certification program that the author offers and is only supplemental reading for the course. Maybe in the context of the certification program this ""book"" makes sense, but as a stand-alone book it does not.Lastly, even though I only paid $3 for this book I still feel like I was ripped off. There are much better resources related to posture, I'd recommend just about anything over this book."
3,First Name: Carmen,"Godard shows the confidence of his filmmaking by being completely indifferent. The plotline and characters are so befuddled that you can't imagine anyone else having the guts to make it. The lack of energy is sometimes irratating, but you can't look away; it's like an understated Joycean dream sequence."
4,There's a new boy in town - yay!!!,"While many people still dwell over the fact that Hal Jordan is no longer with us as the GREEN LANTERN (going nuts and killing all other GL's around then adopting a GOD-like attitude will do that to you), it seems that an equal amount if not more have accepted and ended up loving KYLE RAYNER as the newly appointed GL. This story will take you back to the early days of KYLE, coming to grips with his new destiny. See what made him the hero he is today - recommended reading!!"
5,great chilli kit,I RECEIVED A PACKET OF CHILI KIT FROM A FRIEND.ALL YOU NEED IS THE MEAT AND TOMATO SAUCE.THANK
1,"Great idea, but poor design","The TempAssure feature sounded great, but is the downfall of an otherwise good product.The lid employs a probe to measure the air temperature inside the carafe and display it on a gauge. The valve that opens and closes to dispense coffee moves up and down on that probe, and that's the problem. When you pour coffee, you move the o-ring seal down the probe and it stays there. You have now created a path for coffee or water to get into the TempAssure lid and grow any number of things.If I never knocked it over or never washed the lid, it would be perfect.The food safety aspects prompted me to throw it out rather than give it to charity."
2,Ugh,"So it's not a bad book, but all the ""dialog"" that is tossed around and written as fact, combined with the drawings done by some five year old that are sprinkled throughout the book, combined with all the padding with cliche' ""pirate"" phrases makes me feel like I'm back in elementary school... The book may have also been edited by someone in elementary school. After they watched Pirates of the Carribean.It's fine. It's light. But if you're looking for any kind of scholarly or serious work on Blackbeard this is NOT that book."
3,Wii steering wheel,"Kinda cool, but i am having trouble with oversteer. Maybe it takes time and practice. I like the conceptdltipton"
5,Mis-titled but nonetheless wonderful,"Well there is nothing Doo-wop or rock N roll about this group.Earth Angel is a cover of the Penguins hit, and Sh-boom is a cover of the Chords hit. But I am not saying either are bad. Some covers are better than the originals. You be the judge. Now for the tunes on this CD. Some good stuff here.Their sound is like the ""Joe College"" of pop music. The harmonies are crisp and tight. They sound similar to the Hi-Lo's. They came out under the banner of rock N roll in the fifties, but they were a little too sweet sounding to be considered rock artists. ""Crazy 'bout ya Baby"" can be considered a novelty tune and not a real rock song. Also listen to ""Chop-chop Boom"" for any reference to the rock music of that era (Elvis, Chuck Berry, Fats) and it misses big time. Their sound is wonderful but it is neither Doo-wop or rock N roll. Maybe swing (like the Four Aces???) but more like pure pop music. Nice tunes here, not too much filler, and enjoyable listen."
4,Nice digitizer board,"Old digitizer board that has served us well over the years. Good brand and a nice board. If you can pick it up used, go for it!"
2,"Just the Facts, M'am","I just finished reading this book and I, too, was very disappointed with the ending. OK, so the author didn't want to wait until after the trial to finish the book. How about an update or afterward? It's not unheard of. Ann Rule had an afterward with 2 updates for The Stranger Beside Me, each time believing it was the last chapter in the Ted Bundy story, until if finally was with Bundy's execution.Back to this story. It was terribly written. This book was just the facts and nothing but the facts. Yes the story is horrifying, but I feel there was so much left unsaid, and the story could have been told so much better.All in all I'd have to say, don't waste your money on this one."
4,UNFINISHED BUSINESS,"THE BOOK WAS VERY GOOD, BUT THE AUTHOR SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR TRIAL RESULTS. I CANNOT FIND ANYWHERE THAT TELLS IF THIS WOMAN WAS FOUND GUILTY, AND IF SO, WHAT HER PUNISHMENT WAS."
1,not so good,"i just read this book and i have to say i was not impressed, i think the writer should have told more about the abuse that went on in the home and also should have waited till the trial was over so what happened?????"
4,easy to understand,This book has been a great help for me to understand the basic's of my digital camera and how the different settings work and how changing the setting can produce pictures with different feelings. I would recommend this book to all those new to digital photography.
4,The Davissons,"The book was packaged well to preserve it through postal services. I have just started to work with it but I am in hopes that it will answer a few nagging questions regarding the family ties in the 1700-1800s that are not answered by censuses, etc. The family history is very hazy at one point and I am in hopes that this book may answer the brick wall I have run into. I wish that I could get my hands on the Arthur H. Davison book that is out of print."
5,Excellent headphones,I ordered these to be delivered just as my father was being released from a nursing home..His hearing is poor and television is his only entertainment. He loves these headphones. They are easy for him to operate and they work very well.
1,What's authentic about this figure???,"This is described as an authentic military figure in the product description. How many wars did Bush fight in exactly? If I dressed up in a military uniform maybe they can make a figure of me. Apparently playing dress-up is all that is required for this particular company to render your likeness onto an ""authentic"" military figure. They should do one of that dude from the Village People while they are at it."
2,Her Worst,"I'm her biggest fan, i praise her voice to everybody that would listen. I have all her cd's and i thought she could do no wrong, that's why i bought this on sight instead of sound. i figured i did'nt have to hear it because it was rachelle ferrell!!! boy was i wrong and disappointed to the point i've had this for years and only listened to it once. i still love her and i think she has the greatest voice ever. TO REALLY APPRECIATE HER VOICE YOU MUST GO SEE HER LIVE OR AT LEAST BUY HER CD- LIVE IN MONTRIEUX!!! i've seen her live every time she was here and her voice is unique and awesome!"
5,Absolutely Great CD,"I purchased this CD when it was first released, but I lost it. Her voice is amazing. Her brother is singing a duet with her on this CD, amazing."
2,Not Very Good,Tried using this to seal hole in my pond but it was a complete failure. I followed the directions but the leak continued and was forced to buy a whole new liner.
1,MAY CONTAIN PEANUTS,"I know Amazon has its disclaimer that the information it provides may differ from the information on the actual packaging of the item. So I probably should be upset with Genisoy about this issue. When I got the package, I was severely disappointed to find ""MAY CONTAIN PEANUTS"" under the ingredient list. If you suffer from a peanut allergy and are searching for a peanut alternative, steer far far away from this product!!!"
2,less than advertised,"The book is well notated with a break down of each each song in phrases. Provides detailed tips of how to play the song. Unfortunately there are 12 songs on the CD, but only six are notated in the book. The CD doesn't seem to have the rythm-only tracks. This is for more advanced players."
1,"Beach Boys apologists, please.","These albums are the sad nadir of what was once a great band. They should have stopped in 1971 after Sunflower and Surf's Up. You know it, too. Imagine Dennis Wilson as a solo artist fully realized.Sad."
4,GREAT BUT ONLY THROUGH ONE ALBUM,"MIU is one of the worst Beach Boys albums going I think, but because I love the second album on the CD, LA (Light Album), I have actually thought of this worth buying. LA (Light Album) is the last great Beach Boys albums due in large part to the fact that it is the last Beach Boys album to include the great harmonies that have made them so famous. Included on this album is the great 'Good Timin'' and 'Lady Lynda' one of the best songs on the album. If you are put off by what critics are saying of the ten minute disco version of 'Here Comes The Night' then don't be. It's still an alright song especially since one of Dennis Wilsons greatest songs ever: 'Baby Blue.' It's great because the album also ends with a great rocker: 'Shortin' Bread'. Go on, go and buy it and give it a listen. You will be amazed by the LA (Light Album). Hey you might even go beyond me and like the MIU Album. This album definatly deserves a nine."
2,Inane chatter,"I feel like I've just been chattered at by an angsty teenager, there's no real insight into the hardships, the dual lives or any actual looks behind the facade. The author does not examine the reasons for her failing at the first job, nor does she acknowledge her failings outside of ""I should have been more assertive"" The language does flow in a good way though, which is the main reason fo my second star."
4,A good insight into the machinations of a celebrity family,I enjoyed this book. It is an easy read which offers an insightful view of the celebrity lifestyles that appear so carefree and glamorous.
3,cheesy but a decent read,i think this book is more for the teens and twenties reader but still i am over fifty and enjoyed it. a good diversion. hansen is a good writer and she is fair with some nasty hollywood types.
5,Really engaging,"Fabulous book. It will keep you awake reading it until the end. Well written, funny, engaging.I'd definitely recommend it."
3,This is for the specific collector,"One should get this CD if they are very interested in the crossover between jazz and hip-hop. This CD takes you into several tracks that have been used by hip-hop artists of the nineties. The sound is pretty good, but the beats are for those for a taste for hip-hop."
5,"GREAT WORK BY REV. MORGAN, AS USUAL...","Robert Morgan has done it again, and these meditations that reflect on hymns are well-written. Robert Morgan is a blessed speaker, pastor, and writer, and has been for many years. I highly recommend this book for Christians and for lovers of classic hymns."
1,Previewing it saved me from wasting my money,"I previewed this book to see if it looked like it would live up to the hype, and I found this little ""gem"": ""If you must skin a cat, do it quickly"". What is wrong with so many of my fellow engineers that they think animal mutilation and suffering is somehow entertaining? Have they spent so much time among machines that they view life as another set of machines? Whatever the reason, I have neither the time nor the patience to put up with it, either at work or in my choice of reading material (and I've seen way too much of this and much, much worse among my coworkers). At least previewing the book saved me the $20 I would have lost by throwing the thing in the recycle bin."
3,How do we know who is telling the truth?,"I have read The Man Who Listens To Horses and I thought it was an excellent book. I had no reason to doubt anything Mr. Roberts said. Now, after surfing the net and seeing all these ""anti-monty"" sites I am questioning it. Both sides attempt to offer proof that they are the ones telling the truth. How does the reader know whats right and what isn't? What we need is an unbiased scrutiny of the so-called ""proof"" from both sides of the issue. If Monty is telling the truth, he should be credited for it. If he is not, then his book should be taken off the shelves and horse owners should be aware of his false and dangerous methods. Why waste our time arguing instead of getting someone to validate one side or the other?"
1,No warranty stamp on certificate,There was no stamp on the certificate. The glass on my watch broke and now i have to pay to get it fixed.
4,Snow shovel,"At a time in mid-winter when there seemed to be no end to snowfall and ice accumulation the only place I could get a snow shovel was through Amazon. People were looking for new shovels because the ones we had were breaking. The stores couldn't keep up with demand. All they would say is ""maybe we'll get some in next shipment, but no guarantees."" We finally gave up looking and waiting. We checked Amazon and thank goodness they were there! We wound up picking up 2 so we could get one for our daughter and son-in-law also. Every time I finally look at Amazon when I've been looking around for something, I find it there and think ""why don't I just look at Amazon first?"" I hopefully will do that from now on."
4,Good value,"So the shovel is my go-to shovel to spot clean snow and especially good at scrapping to the pavement to clear the walks. It's a bit short I think for my height, but then again I am 6' 2"". It fits perfect for my wife though. Very lightweight, almost so that I thought it would be too cheap to use, but its just the light weight material used despite a steel core in the handle. Very lightweight for throwing snow. Received it with shipping included. Where I live, I could not find a decent shovel. If your going to clean a large surface area, you probably need a wide shovel as well as this one for spot cleaning and when you need something very easy to handle. I would think this shovel would be good for seniors too even without the fancy curved handle."
4,Fun book with a good twist.,"While I wouldn't call this book a edge of your seat, stay up all night to finish page turner, I really enjoyed this book. The characters are all very believable and some even likable (always a must when reading a book where the criminals are the protagonists.) It held a few good surprises. Well worth the reading; I would probably even read it a second time."
4,"Oly-Ann, not Ole-n","Though in general, I enjoyed the writing and the story, one flaw annoyed me throughout. The town central to the plot is pronounced oly-ann, not oly-n. I once lived on Olean (oly-ann) Road, somewhat north of Olean (Oly-ann), in western New York state. A bit of research would have revealed the correct pronunciation."
4,"Good, but different","I knew I would miss Richard Anderson, but Ben Browder is growing on me. Beau Bridges makes a great Commanding General, good casting.Claudia Black as Vala has really helped to make the show interesting and funny, I really love her character!"
5,Looks great,"Haven't had a chance to watch the DVDs, but the look perfect and should be fine! Came really quick!"
4,Wanted the thick pack,"Star Gate is amazing, Amazon delivered the product on time. I thought I had purchased the thick pack so it would match the seasons 1-8 I already own. The picture of the box set on the web site isn't very clear.Over all I was satisfied with my purchase."
5,awesome,The episode Camelot is the best in the season. The battle at the end plus the awesome cliffhanger leave us impatient for the next season.
5,stargate sg-1 Season 9 Boxed Set (Thinkpak),"Season 9 featuring the original SG-1 team and the addition of Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder) in it's continuing fight against the Ori.Awesome special effects, commentaries and behind the scene videos for the Sg-1 fan!"
4,The rest of the story.,"Still miss Richard Dean Anderson, but the characters are true to the story and great in their own rights. Had to have all the series. Who know's when a series as great as Star Trek and Stargate will come along again!"
4,Not as strong as I hoped.,"After reading the reviews, I thought the shovel would be more substantial. I gave this shovel to my son (2 1/2 years old) for X-Mas, as he always wants to help me shovel snow. For him, the shovel will be perfect (thus my rating of 4 stars). If an adult tried to move a shovel load of heavy wet snow this shovel, I believe it would break at the connection joint with the blade."
5,A definite must!!,"After my son wrote all over the carpet, TV, fireplace, VCR, door, window, coffee table, entertainment center, and walls with a sharpie marker, I called my sister in a panic. She grabbed this book and told me the suggestions for cleaning ink stains. I got the marker off the carpet and entertainment center completely and greatly reduced the stain on the rest. I am ordering this book TODAY. It is a must have in our house with 2 toddlers and another on the way!!!"
3,An Okay Book,"This is an okay guide for how to clean ""practically anything,"" but it's outdated. And, there are other books which are more detailed. Plus, there's the internet."
3,Not the best not the worst,"Well, maybe i've got a defective copy but... My CD starts half way through a WORD Big Joe Turner is singing half way through the first verse of Stormy Weather. Quite Strange. In a way that sums it up for the rest of the albumWhile this album has it's strong points, most notably Sonny Stitt, there is quite a bit of floundering as well. The drummer is obviously thinking about slipping in slick stuff, and more often than not it gets in the way of the groove. Big Joe's voice is only on on about 1/2 the tracks - and on those he's killing - but on the rest it's a big hoarse.I wouldn't say ""don't buy this"" but I would suggest not getting it as an introductory album to a new blues/jazz listener."
4,October Road - my thoughts,"I think the style of music on this album is actually a little different than all the rest of James Taylor's music. A couple of the songs actually sound like country music. The last song, Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas sounds great, though I think an explanation of this song should have been included in the booklet. Apparently it is for the friends & families of 9/11, knowing that makes the song a welcome addition to this album. I have every James Taylor album, and this is a must have."
3,Nice CD but not great.,"Like most of those taking the time to read this, I am a huge JT fan and have every one of his albums. I'm such a fan I have the tendency to lie and say this album is awesome but its not. Its just nice. Just hearing JT's voice is like hearing from an old friend (especially since he has become famous with his shyness and disinterest in having us hear about him through the spoken word), but none of these songs moved me in a way that Fire and Rain or Secret of Life or Like Everyone She Knows (or so many others) did. It's a nice CD. I'll listen to it for a week and then probably go back to his earlier CD's that moved me more. I would never wish him ill, but if he weren't so darn content with his life maybe his songs would be more full of the emotional color that attracted many of us to him in the first place."
3,Great Potential But Overproduced,"What a pity. James Taylor crafts 11 beautiful pensive tracks only to have them swallowed up in a sugary glittery mess of reverb, excessive layers of backing vocals, gurgling water, and literal bells and whistles.Instead of a straight up dry martini we get a frozen daiquiri with little umbrellas sprouting out. JT was blessed with a gorgeous voice and there is no need to dilute it so heavily in a cesspool of backing vocals. If this CD were stripped down to the basics Id steadfastly award it 5 stars. Standouts are: September Grass, October Road, On the 4th Of July, and My Traveling Star. Listen to Neil Youngs ÒSilver & GoldÓ CD and try to imagine that sort of pure, down and dirty yet very compelling sound on this CD and youll understand what Im talking about."
4,One of his best,"Hourglass seemed to get more favorable reviews than this one, but I prefer this much more than Hourglass.I'm not knocking Hourglass, but I think this is a much stronger album overall. In fact, I think this is his best album since That's Why I'm Here."
5,Good Cap.,Seals tight and looks great on my new 351W engine. It is just what I needed for my Eidelbrock covers. Great price too.
4,movie,Like this particular movie series and wanted to add this one to my collection. Movie was a good price to pay.
1,Who are you people kidding?,"The reviewers of these two albums take themselves way to seriously. There is only one word to describe these albums""embarassing"". If the Beach Boys had issued any one of these songs as a demo to Capitol instead of Surfin I am certain that we would have never been given the chance to hear from them again. I'd give both of them a half a star if I were able. ."
3,Not my favorite,Loves the late Gil Scott-Heron I just found this a tough read. I didn't find the characters compelling. I'm glad he wrote better songs. Miss you Gil.
5,A quirky classic of television comedy,"Wow, I'm a bit too young to remember the Addams Family in its original run on network television, but I love the Charles Addams cartoons, and have always liked John Astin, so I bought this dvd set. It is just wonderful. Nice clean prints of the episodes. Great writing, and a wonderful ensemble cast. And there really is a subtle message in these shows about being true to yourself and being kind. The more savage-appeal of the movies is absent here-these characters are quirky, but well-meaning, and I heartily recommend this set. The commentary with Steve Cox, Lisa Loring, Ken Weatherwax and Felix Silla is also terrific and fun and gives a bit of behind-the-scenes flavor that is very welcome."
1,addams family volume 1 dissatisfied,i was under the impression that was the entire 1st season and it certainly was not. this product was described incorrectly and dishonestly.
4,A good book on French Polishing,"This is a good book if you are interested in learning how to french polish. The author seems to have a great deal of experience in dying and french polishing and covers both in this book. Also, there is some information on pore filling. Other topics such as varnish, oils, and lacquers are not covered well. So, if you are looking for a good french polish method that works, this is it, if you are looking for information on a different finish, look elsewhere."
2,Poor Design,"This belt is poorly designed and falls apart when trying to cinch it tight. The buckle does not secure the belt and pops off too easy. I love the contoured design, but I have had better belts."
4,good but not great stuff.,"keepin the summer alive is a great track! the cd is less so. But it's got some good songs on it and some just average ones. When you are a big band and you put out average stuff you get those negative reviews from people who won't give this one a chance. It's a three star record , but the next one is four star for sure. THe beach boys is a solid one and a better effort. Not a bad song on here either it's just got a more polished songwriting feel generally."
5,Green Laser Pointer,I bought the green laser pointer for my husband. He loves using it for presentations at work. The green laser is a nice change from the usual red lasers.
1,Stunningly bad.,"My son brought this home from the school library today. I enjoy reading with him and almost without exception children's books have one or more redeeming qualities: humor, information, a plot. This book is missing all of these and is, IMHO, devoid of any merit whatsoever.Adding insult to injury, this book is part of a series featuring the word ""science"" in the title. Hmm...a science book about ghosts--guess I found some humor after all.Avoid."
3,A bit small.,"We bought this for a holiday gift for my partners nephew. It seemed pretty neat from the description. I must have misunderstood something because this is actually quite small. I thought for the price that it would be a tad bigger. So, I was disappointed. I'm not sure if he liked it or not, I never did get any feedback - so my rating is purely for overall appearance and experience of delivery."
5,Such a great book...,"This is really a fabulous book, I have never read anything like it. It is suspenseful and thrilling, but not in that cheesy classic thriller way so many books are. There are lots of twists and turns, and it is fast-paced. The best part about this book is that it deals with deeper and more intellectual themes that most suspense novels never cover. What a great read, I HIGHLY recommend it!"
4,The cat who went to heaven,"If you read only one of the three books on Norton the Scottish Fold, this should be it. Not only are the writing style and design of the book better than the other two, it's the most emotional and thoughtful as well. The two previous books tell of Norton's adventures as a series of events, and in this third, Gethers continues that tradition. But he also adds something of a meditation on death and on caring for others. There are moments where it seems to get sentimental, but the feelings are so genuine that you can't help but be moved."
2,Not Big Enough! Sharp Edges When Broken,"I bought this glass in hope that it would help me with my image at parties. lately it isn't very popular to carry around and drink sriaght out of The Bag, from a box wine. However, when I got my Giant wine glass it was not that giant and would not even hold a whole box or bag of wine? I thought I would give it a try anyway. Half way through the party I was getting tipsy, I was so use to drinking from the bag that I tried to ""Slap The Bag"" and ended up with a hand full of glass and an emergency room visit. Suggetion, make it twice as big out of plastic."
1,"Plastic crap, it won't last","I bought this to chip ice and after the first day the hard plastic started chipping off in chunks and finally (within 1 storm time-period) was completely whittled down to just the pole. This won't last, invest in an a full-metal ice breaker."
5,Second book you should buy,"This is the second book that anyone interested in learning Astronomy should buy, right after buying and reading NightWatch. Everything is well written, easy to understand and nicely arranged. I can't say enough about how valuable this book is for everyone from beginners to experienced users."
5,Great Reference,THe Backyard Astronomer's Guide is an amazing publication. It is packed full of useful material that is specifically aimed at all amateur astronomers from beginner to expert. If you are looking for a great reference to check your facts or if you are just starting out this is for you - everything is explained in laymans terms and the book is laid out with great illustrations. If you are looking for advanced astrophysics and technical data don't get this book. This book is like the roots that you grow a large tree of knowledge on with regards to astronomy and stands well as a great basis for every amateur astronomer.Highly recommended!
2,More down to earth recipes wanted,I was very disappointed with the recipes in this book. I look more for standard fare and this book does not have much of that. If you like the unusual then this book is for you.
4,A good collectors item,"Stages is a compulation of pictures that were taken of Britney in the height of her career. The over sized magazine pages and pictures are a great addition for collectors who desire Britney Spears memorabilia. Included in the illustration is a DVD pertaining to her time in Mexico, where she had to cut her concerts, due to poor weather. If most remember Mexico was upset with Britney for cutting her concerts. After seeing this, it's plain to see why she cut the concerts early. Over all a great collectors item. 4****"
5,Great,"One of my grandson's favorite characters, as it is mine. Although he's only four years old, I don't feel that it was too violent for him."
4,hulk,"it was fine i guess. i got my movie when it said i would get it, so no problems here i suppose."
3,Good,"I got my Hulk dose, but heck the first one was better for me. Most people are split about the two movies but this movie just did'nt hold the same excitement as the first one did. I think the actors were better in the first one even though Edward was'nt to bad.Overall still a descent movie."
2,Lame.... Thought it would be much better.,"Love Norton and Tyler, although this movie didn't give them much to work. I am surprised this averaged 4 stars."
4,movies in at night,"good flick, enjoyed watching it with husband. I think he likely enjoyed it more than I, but sometimes watching him is the most fun!"
4,Incredible action,"We enjoyed this movie. Great action scenes. I love Edward Norton as an actor, however I must say I enjoy Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk better."
2,Didn't have three disc,I love the movie but it did not have three disc as I thought. The movie is in very good shape
4,"More entertaining than Ang Lee's version, but not as deep or stylish","I'm one of the few people who liked Ang Lee's ""Hulk."" I thought it was a great blend of character and action, up there with ""X2."" Yeah, it had some slow spots and the CGI was inconsistent, but the Shakespearean storyline and the artistic visual style set it apart from other superhero films. The new ""Incredible Hulk"" is more by-the-numbers in terms of style and character depth, but it's definitely better in terms of action and effects. The first one tried to be serious; this one just tries to be fun. In my view, both have succeeded in what they set out to do.Bottom line: If you were disappointed by Lee's version, you'll probably like this one. I happened to like Lee's version and found this one more entertaining, if not as unique or intelligent.Richard Yee, author of Deliveries: A Collection"
2,very disappointed - ang lee's is superior,"really looked forward to this flick but mostly every thing about this is bad. horribly casted, horrible acting, story unimaginative , musical score completely forgettable, horrible directed and edited . this is worth a rental for the fight sequences but fans of ang lee's Hulk will be sorely disappointed."
5,Hulk,"This version smokes the first one in every way. Special effects are off the chart, everything looks real."
3,"Entertaining, but Avengers showed what Hulk might be","Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" tried for more, but with a poor casting choice for the Hulk. This Hulk is fun, but like Lee's, the 3D animation is not what it should have been. More to the point, this Hulk is just more formulaic. Edward Norton is an excellent actor, but he just doesn't have the presence. And if you've seen Mark Ruffalo in Avengers, you've seen what can be brought to the role. Tim Roth is good, but under-used. The 3D effects for his beast are weaker, I think, than those for the Hulk. The last 20 minutes of the film with the showdown between the Hulk and Roth's beast are the weakest part of the film. Again the 3D effects are surprisingly poor. For example, the helicopter in which Liv Tyler and William Hurt get tossed around looks like something we'd get in a SciFi (SyFy) channel homemade movie.All in all, diverting enough for two hours, but not much more than that."
4,Excellent Comic Book Movie,This version of the Incredible Hulk is a good comic book movie. If you are a fan of Marvel comics you will enjoy this film. The action scenes treat as if they were lifted from a comic book ... as does all of the character tie-ins (Marvel is infamous for this little trick). I've collected comics for years and really look forward to these movies. The first Hulk directed by Ang Lee was a little disappointing ... but this one is a lot of fun! Put it in your collection you won't be disappointed.
3,"A better Hulk, not the best comic redo",It was certainly worth seeing and mich better then the previous hulk movie but average as far as superhero movies go.
2,Slow to get started. Even slower to finish.,"The first two thirds of the movie are more like an unimaginative action flick than a superhero movie. A lot of these scenes are devoted to establishing the back story, which they somehow manage to do poorly. Tim Roth is top-notch for a lot of roles, but his casting as a menacing antisuperhero in this movie must be some sad joke on both him and the audience. The final battle will appeal to both non-discriminating special effects fans and those who religiously TiVo WWE Smackdown.The heavy use of the color green adds an occasionally welcome dollop of camp, however.,Wil"
2,Disappointing,"Just watched this last night with my daughter. We bought it as one of the prequels to ""Avengers"", but now wonder why. The background of the plot is barely glossed over in flashes during the opening credits, leaving one with only a vague idea of the preceeding story. The whole script is two-dimensional and the characters are actually just caricatures. ""The General"" is a bad joke and Liv Tyler's character is little more than a Care Bear - ""It's all right"", ""No, don't, please"" repeated endlessly.Thank God they got Joss Whedon to do the newer movies!If all you're interested in is CGI special effects, might as well get a lobotomy and watch ""Transformers"" movies."
2,3 Disc set is really 2 discs BEWARE,The 3 disc set only comes with 2 discsDisc 1 Feature FilmDisc 2 ExtrasYou also get a piece of paper with a code to download a digital copy of the movie. So despite what the listings says you will only get 2 discs
3,"INCREDIBLE BEGINNING AND MIDDLE, NOT SO INCREDIBLE ENDING!","You know the synopsis, so let's get to the bottom line:Worth watching once; Extras are worth the viewing; and packaging is professional.Family friendly, but plenty of violence and shooting...The beginning and middle are well directed and the story is top-notch... though the film loses splendor toward the second half. CGI is iffy during some scenes toward the end also. Is it worth owning? Sure, if you pre-ordered it."
2,Damaged bonus disc,All of my previous experiences with Amazon have been great. I ordered this disc in like new condition so I figured I would have no problems viewing the disc. The movie plays great but the bonus disc is damaged. You can view some of the content but the alternate opening and the thirty minute doc is unwatchable. I tried two different players and I get the same results. I can't always watch my dvds in a timely manner but I figured incorrectly that like new condition meant that I would have no problems. Will not order from this seller again. Thank you
5,The Incredible Hulk - instant video,"Excellent movie at a great price! It was instantly available with high-quality streaming. Very entertaining and excellent, special effects with a cameo appearance by Lou Ferrigno (the original Hulk from the TV Series).It set the platform for Marvel's Avengers movie."
4,Look For Cap In The Alternate Opening!,"Great BD! In the Alternate Opening, keep an eye on the bottom left corner when everything starts breaking up after the gun shot. You'll see Captain America come flying toward you in the ice. (If you hit Pause and then Slow Step, you'll see the shield pretty clearly.) Also, the U Control setting is a pretty cool feature, especially Scene Explorer - it takes Storyboards and animation effects to a whole new level."
3,Pretty okay,"I think I liked it. But I can't remember. Maybe that says it all. I remember not hating it. So basically if you're bored and looking to pass the time, I can at least say you'll be entertained."
1,worst yet,"Why try to improve what already was excellent? The 2003 Bana Hulk was EXCELLENT, this (Norton Hulk)version was like a discredit of that movie. I hope it doesn't prevent an Hulk 2 of the 2003 Hulk! that one ended with a possible sequel(hopefully). This Norton Hulk trash may cause pause."
2,4 stars?? NO WAY,"This movie PALES in comparison to the Ang Lee version. Hulk does NOT look very good, and the fight scenes are so, so. Get the FIRST one to see good visual effects. The original is the superior movie BY FAR."
4,The Hulk is Back With a Vengeance!!!,"I remember seeing this on Friday the 13th, and buying it while we were traveling to get my dad signed up for his retirement! This version of The Incredible Hulk is a lot better than the 2003 version. It has more elements to the classic t.v. series! The Hulk looks awesome! The fight that the Hulk has with Abomination is pretty sweet! The 2003 version was a lot more military oriented and had a soap opera element between father and son, but this one is just right. It even has a cameo from Tony Stark! I highly recommend THE INCREDIBLE HULK!!!"
4,Where Was The Third Disc?,"DVD's worked great and it came right on time. However there was one thing I noticed, the third disc from the set was not there. I had no intention of using it, so it isn't a big deal at all, but I don't remember reading in that the third disc wouldn't be included. Other than that, no problems!"
3,Tries to bear a heavy duty message with overacting galore,"The message of standing up for women's rights and fighting the objectification of women was the one saving grace of this film. The characters could not have tried any harder to overact, and it was barely watchable. Or perhaps I've outgrown this age bracket of Lesbian drama. My partner and I watch some of the ""standouts"" occasionally, but this one will not be a benchmark for me.The movie does offer some interesting psychological twists such as the relationship between the older woman who founded an organization, and the young, blonde (and extremely overacted), girl. The ""roughing up"" of the network was funny, and the highlight of the film, but overall, this film was a ""miss"" for me."
2,ITTY BITTY TITTU COMMITTEE,I DIDN'T LIKE THIS MOVIE. I THINK I HAVE WATCHED TO MUCH LWORD THAT HAD A STORY LINE. I THINK THIS WAS MADE FOR REALLY YOUND TEENAGE GIRLS.
3,Itty Bitty,"Ok, the title is why I rented it through Netflix, BUT, also the fact that the ever hot Daniela Sea is in it! This youthful and angst filled movie is good, reflecting the anger and confusion of young lesbians and transgendered trying to find their way in a very straight world. The movie was good enough to keep my attention throughout. It had a punk edge to it as well as a sarcastic humor."
3,Danner boots are always a gamble.,"I have always liked Danner boots my last pair were the most comfortable boots I had ever worn the Men's Recon though are ""to long"" the ""toe is to pointed"" and there is ""zero arch support"" the little plastic insert they send along is an insult, unfortunately they are awkward and uncomfortable."
5,very delicious,"This is the best instant hot chocolate ever. It is hard to find in the stores, so I love it that Amazon sells it. Enjoy"
5,Outstanding,The people in these movies are awsome actors and actresses. I have come to want to be them and get so caught up in their lives I can't wait for the next. You must see this and enjoy what you have.
4,"Excellent review, but too much","I used the Princeton Review Physics before taking the SAT II in December. The book covered literally everything I had learned in physics, down to the smallest detail. However, it also contained added sections that were not on the test, nor are they ever on the test, according to my physics teacher. The sections on vector multiplication are not needed until you take the AP Physics exam, nor are a number of other sections. However, it is better to have too much than not enough. The one thing that annoyed me most, however, was the practice tests. These were infinitely more difficult than the real thing. There was no score conversion, but I figured my score to be somewhere in the high 600s, and on the actual test, I got an 800. So, if you don't do well on the tests in this book, don't be discouraged, and if you do well, you should easily be able to get 750+."
5,iSound,"I think that its awesome because the colors that it lights up in are cool {there red and blue}and also when you put your fingers on the plastic ball it looks like fire in red at the surface of the plastic ball. To let you know it only goes off on certain beats. It plugs in to a wall just to let you know. It works with an Ipod, or Iphone, it works with an MP3 it works with a laptop and computer and more. Theres alot more things about it but those are the most important and coolist features to me. I Hope that you get and like it, if you do only get it if you like to listen to music. You'll love it!!!!!"
1,Not a good product,"My son won the iSound Plasma in a contest. The sound is fine, but the plasma globe has problems. It was a promising feature, but the bulb now remain dark. If you tap it, it breifly works. I tried to contact the company. The website tries to down load a dangerous files. Telephone support is useless. Great concept, but don't buy it."
2,Poorly made,"I got this for Christmas, and it's a mixed review for me. I'm actually pleased with the sound, as I wanted this for my office at work. Just wanted something I could plug my nano in and so replace the boombox I had here. So for what is required of it, I have no problems with the sound, as I never really crank it up. However, the 'visual' component was a major disappointment. Within a week the 'bulb' at the top no longer functioned. I gather there is a short of some type, as if I push down on the glass ball on top I'll get a visual light effect for 2 seconds. Otherwise, nothing. Since part of the appeal of this was to have the light effects WITH the speakers, I'd have to advise caution in buying this. You can probably get speakers just as good cheaper elsewhere, and my experience says you are rolling the dice if you are buying this for the light effects as well."
3,A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Cameron Dokey has written excellent romantic novels. Although, this hasn't been one of her best novels. The beginning of the story was good although it lacks in the end. The story could have been excellent if she had worked more on the conflict and the characters involving in the novel. I would have liked if Cameron had to portrayed the antagonist more realistic in the novel. Yet, I think this novel is similar to the other novel she did called THE TALISMAN."
4,A Good Study Guide,"T. M. Moore's new book on Ecclesiastes is a very attractive study guide. Its strengths are that it is a concise study that is formatted to a 13-week series replete with study questions for each chapter. The author has not only provided his own translation but includes his own interpretive paraphrase ajacent to the text. Its weaknesses are that due to format for study (with full footnoting included) it can be sheer tedium to read through the book in one sitting. In addition, perhaps an unintended oversight is found in the introduction where he claims the phrase ""under the heavens"" occurs only at 1:13 and 3:1. It also appears in 2:3. One last weakness is that, in order to set forth his own interpretive view of Ecclesiastes, his interpretive paraphrase is often too free with the original Hebrew text. However, I still recommend it at the introductory level as a resource for personal or group study."
5,Great pair of boots at a great price.,Great fitting boot. I have worn caterpillar boots now for over eleven years and these are by far the most comfortable pair that I have got.Even though they are the 8 style they where not to bad in bedding in.Shipping was prompt and the tracking number (along with google earth) help me estimate day of arrival. Will buy these boots again when the time comes.
2,Why does this book exist?,"I really can't see the purpose of this book for either buyers or sellers. McBroom gives very little information about the cameras themselves, certainly not enough for anyone to make a decision about whether to buy a particular camera -- in many cases he gives only a price. Moreover, he restricts himself to only relatively common and recent cameras for which more accurate pricing information is readily available from eBay."
4,Nice,I bought this for my wii for my ex to play. It took him a while to get use to it because he's not use to playing with a remote and a nun chuck but after he got the hang of it he liked it.
5,All 2 Boys LOVE to Play These Types of Games,Boys have multiple versions for different formats. This is as much fun as the others and they are very pleased.
5,rival swords ultimate game,this is truly a great game for the wii. Better then gamecube version due to i can play with my son being it was toned down a little.
4,Another Good One From Susan Carroll,"I really, really enjoyed this trilogy and couldn't wait for each book to be released. It can't be over! To many unanswered questions and loose ends. Please say it isn't so....."
5,We're evaluating NetWeaver and this helped,Very useful in seeing who is getting results using NetWeaver and the recommendations were good.
2,watch for the shipping cost,The item was ok but ordered late one night and didn't realize the shipping cost was so much. Good price on item put shipping is a killer.
1,Sad,It was sad to give this to my daughter for Hanukkah and find that it does not pick up the heartbeat.I have to return it.
5,Ultimate animal lover's collection of mystery and suspense!,"Penned by a diverse group of outstanding writers including classic masters and rising stars, these irresistible animal capers from the pages of ""Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine"" will delight anyone who loves animals and loves a good mystery! Examples include a hex on a kitten spells catastrophe, a detective's discovery of illegal dogfighting gets him roughed up, a stuffed penquin takes sides in a marital dispute, a puzzling poisoning frames a snake in the grass, a man must choose between his mutt and his mate, a lighthearted tale of a purloined kangaroo, an elephant is suspected of truncating the talent. . . and many more stories!"
5,Rich and speedy,"I first bought these for backpacking on Cascade and Olympic mountain trails, but found I use them as often in the home! This is a rich, flavorful soup that's as easy to make as boiling water. I tend to buy them in bulk because I give as many to friends as I use for myself. I've used other Alessi products with equal satisfaction."
4,bean soup,"product was easy to make and tastsed great!the reason for only 4 stars instead of 5,was it only makes 2 bowls of soup!other soups tried made a lot more and just as good taste."
4,Almost Perfect,"The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because it does not have as many movies as ""Maltin's Movie and Video Guide."" I buy ""Maltin's Move and Video Guide"" on odd numbered years and ""Video and DVD Guide"" by Martin and Porter on even numbered years. Maltin has the best, most comprehensive movie reviews and Martin and Porter have the best cast index. Between the two you can find everything you could possibly want!"
1,SIMPLY IRRITATING,"After reading the reviews on Amazon.com I bought this book. I quickly saw that I should have taken more note of the negative reviews here. So I'm writing this to add to their number so others won't waste their money (and isn't that what simple living is about?). The other negative reviewers really say it all for me, so I advise any perspective readers of this book to read their comments before buying this book. There is much better material out there, such as the books written by Janet Luhrs (also called SIMPLE LIVING) and Vicky Robin (YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE)."
2,Subpar,"I tried to like this CD, but I just can't. Although his heart is in the right place... Unfortunately the quality of the album is not there. I couldn't find one song that I fully liked. There were parts of a song that I liked, but unfortunately either the beats were too old-sounding or the hook was totally off. Perhaps he will evolve into a better artist. I can see potential...."
5,Good Daily Reader,"I purchased this reader for someone just starting out with a 12 step program. I couldn't get this person to attend daily nor weekly meetings BUT, I could get them to read this daily reader. After just a few weeks of committing to this reader, they have now found the courage to start attending meetings. I can speak rather highly of most if not all of the Hazelden publications!Another great book is ""The Language Of Letting Go"" by Melody Beattie. This too is a wonderful daily reader that, can help with those times when life just seems too heavy. I've lived under the tree of therapy professionals now for 23 years so, trust me when I tell you, you can't go wrong with either of these books."
2,As The Title Says - Simple,"This book is designed for those in the beginning or renewal stages of recovery. I was in the renewal stage but found the quotes a little simple. They are all quite short which may be good for beginniners, or people who like such kinds of quotes.Each month represents one step in the 12 steps of recovery, and the quotes for each month do include parts of the steps and prayers, along with AA slogans. Each day has a quote, followed by a writing as per usual. It has a nice touch of adding not only a prayer for the day but also an action for the day too."
4,Easily readable,Good flow to the story. Characters rang true and JP Beaumont is a flawed sympathetic character. Wasn't sure until the end who did it.
5,excellent cans,"This review is for the Sony MDR-EX71SL's. These headphones are great. Outstanding bass response;better than many over-the-ear type cans i've used. The cord is short but you must use the supplied extension cable. Also, the headphones must be put in from the back so when you take them out of your ears they hang down from your neck; cool idea Sony! The earpads (small,med,and large) do impact the sound greatly. So you have to make sure you have the right size in your ear. If you own an iPOD like myself, get the white Sony MDR-EX71SL's. Sony got it right with these cans!"
5,I love these earbuds,"I use these to listen to Flamenco music and television. I find them to have terrific sound quality. I have no overwhelming bass problem as one other customer described. I have never been one to turn the volume up extremely loud, so my hearing is good. I compared the sound on these to three others, including a pair of expensive Sennheisers, and found these not to be lacking."
5,Private Music,"I bought these (actually similar Sony ones but more expensive) to replace the iPod ones. 1) these fit better. 2) the sound goes into my head and nowhere else hence not bothering anybody. 3) I don't have to hear anybody else's which really drives me up the wall.The sound is great and will be only as good as your recording. I would like to see a storage case though, I keep mine in a pouch.So if you see my head bobbing, it's me, my iPod and these fine earbuds. I don't go anywhere without them. High recommended and an excellent buy on Amazon."
4,No problems,"Sensitivity is adjustable via a dial on the side of the sensor.With high sensitivity, these things will go off if you slam a door too close to them.With low sensitivity, they will still go off if you bang hard on the window... which isexactly what you want (someone breaking the window will definitely be hitting it harderthan that).I bought 4 of them to try with my SC-1000 and they are great.The sticky pads actually stick to windows. I thought they were going to be as bad as the""temporary stickers"" that come with the door sensors, but they are much better. We've had80 deg F to 30 deg F here in Minnesota, and the stickies still work. Be nice to see if theylast through the really cold winter.You don't have to use the stickies. You can just lean your sensor up against the windowand it works just as well... but that only works for certain kinds of sliding windows, orwindows you never open."
4,Vibration Sensor,"It absolutely serves the purpose I purchased it for. The sensitivity level can be adjusted to extremly sensitive like a single knock or putting a key in the door (that sensitive). It is very good for the purposes for which it is intended to work with the Skylink alarm. I highly recommend it if you are in needed of monitoring a place which requires sensing vibration/movement. (Doors, Drawers, Glass, etc)"
5,Must have book for Women with ADD and people in their lives,This is an extremely well put together book. It explains the many aspects of women living with ADD. Not only does it cover ADD but it also gives information on other conditions that women with ADD to also have. It covers many areas of women's lives in which ADD can affect. It offers great explanations and suggestions for women with ADD to better their lives.
5,Must Read,"This book will be a validating reading experience for any woman who has AD/HD, not to mention those in her family who want to understand her better. The author breaks down the symptoms, perceptions and realities of AD/HD so that the reader can get a clearer picture of what AD/HD is for women and what can be done in order to improve their lives. There are many references included in the book so continued research and reading is made easy. Do not pass this book by - you'll miss out on some VERY important information that will change your life for the better."
2,A classic title I now regret buying,"A talented and well respected woodworker like Jim Tolpin, I expected something very special but was disappointed. This is a very ordinary book. The one thing I was amazed was not in a book of this type in the lay out section is a detailed discription of reference marks. How to mark face and edge as the reference everything is laid out from; not there. How to mark draws, carcases so they aremade and assemberled correctly. Again not there.Then the errors that are present such as the plan for the trammel beam on p69 where the tapered sliding lock is shown to taper from5/16"" to 5/16"" over a 3/4"" length. Ther drawing shows a taper but the numbers do not reflect that.There is no place in my small bookcase for a waste of space book like this."
2,Truck driving games,"Convoy is a fun game when hauling goods all across America. The gas stations are cool, the weighstations are cool,as are the Hotels and the border check stations. The only problem is the game runs slow and choppy if the drivers in your computer are old or some of the driver updates are missing. Be sure to update your video card drivers before running this game."
2,Last of the collection,"I would rate this one last on the collection. While the graphics are great, bridges, lit tunnels, and such, game play isn't fun and the dog truck makes starting out excruciating.Get the 18 WOS American Long Haul instead!"
3,Trading Tips,"The book is for fairly advanced traders that are ready to do futures, commodity and currency trading. Perhaps the main theme can be summarized as have a trading plan, measure it and use it religiously if it works vs. going by your gut. It has some trading set up examples. Most seem reasonable, but many example charts have multiple discrepancies in them and are hard to follow or contradict the text. I tried to email the company to explain the discrepancoes but got a generic email back saying that would be a good topic for their discussion forum. Of course joining the forum has a fee. Go figure."
1,Techniques mentioned in this book are not backtested,"As a systematic trader, I don't judge the book by how most people have been reviewing it, I judge by how the ideas mentioned in the book have been proving themselves in real market. It is in this sense that I found the book very shallow, skin-deep. Yes, the author talked about a dozen of trading setups in this book, but none is backtested in a systematic manner. And I have to say, after backtesting, ( it does not take much time as all the setups are simple enough, less than 10 lines of codes) these setups show little edge and consistency."
2,Too many incongruences,I have just bought this book. Went to Chapter 8 and study it deeply. I challenge anyone to understand the strategy explained as there are many incongruence between what explained and the example charts. How can a trading book be confusing?Do not trust my opinion? I challenge anyone to find chapter eight congruent. I challenge anyone.Suggestion: do not buy this book.
2,buy the Audio. visuals are distracting-rehearsal idea is confusing,"i love opera... and the singing in this opera is exquisite... the rehearsal setting at union square-nyc is very distracting. the music and singing is perfecto... if i had only purchased the audio i would be in love. the visuals, that is the stageing being a rehearsal, reminded me of the movie 8 and 1/2..... that is a movie within a movie within a movie, and it completely distracted me from Bellini's beautiful opera. As with this performance, there are very few who sung the role as a mezzo (which was bellini's intention). I wish that Bartoli (mezzo) and Florez's interpretation would be available in something besides audio. i would pay big time for Bartoli and Florez's presentation"
1,I bought the Marware Protection Pack to Prevent it From Getting Dirty,"This is one of the most frustrating things that has happened to me. So I bought my MacBook a week ago and to go a long with it I bought the Marware Protection Pack.The purpose I bought the cover for was to protect my notebook, however the hand rest cover has RUINED my notebook.There is a sticky residue that is left behind when I peeled back the hand rest today. It is all over the hand rest portion of my laptop.Keep in mind that it has been a week.I am irritated and upset that Marware has sold me such a negligible product."
3,Okay.not,. Not definate enough for a beginner. Instructions inadequate. It will take a lot of practice to learn how to make it sound like a hawk. And I know hawks
1,Ink comes off when wet,"I purchased and received these stickers a week ago. Today I cleaned my windows and the ink came right off. This shouldn't happen if it were a good quality product. Please, don't waist your money."
3,Only works on WINDOWS not doors,"One thing that dissapointment me is that none of these stickers will go on a door. The sticky side is on the face of the sticker, so you can only use them in windows. I wanted some I could stick to a door. Don't buy these if you want to stick them on anything other than a window. Having said that, they work great on a window."
4,Good detail for modelers,"In the usual 96-page format, with excellent 3D maps showing different moments of the battle, and plenty of black and white period photos as well as color drawings of the soldiers and equipment, this book gives a nice overview of the first Ypres battle. If you want detail, check the four pages long ""Order of Battle""!You could also get Osprey's ""THE OLD CONTEMPTIBLES"" for more information on the BEF."
2,Yea right,"You charge that much for one episode? I dont think so. I have found it on DVD for $10, and not just one episode, a whole season. Your price is wrong, I dont think your cusomers realize that your taking them for all theyve got. Its wrong."
1,Who's in charge at RCA?,"How can a presumed greatest hits (essential collection) end up with two of Harry's biggest and most famoussongs being included as LIVE versions? What has happen with bona fide song selections? The studio versionsare what everyone heard in the 1950's and remember best (by ear). Apparently, RCA's CD producers for olderartists have no idea what they are doing. I guess it'll get even worse as we get older and the producers get younger. A good ""essential collection"" can only be GOOD if it passes the ""by ear"" test. If you were not aroundin the 50s listening to the originals you have no idea which track to put on the CDs. RCA has entered this stage.And if Harry really did select these songs he should KNOW better!!! I would not have this in my collection is RCA gave it to me gratis.Aloha"
1,Fantastic Product! But Don't Buy it Here!!,I love this minisisc. It holds an incredible amount of songs--the equivolent of an I-pod mini-- and the ease of use of my minidisc recorder is great. BUT DON'T BUY IT HERE! Just by having it in my order it jacked up the shipping charge by $9.00 while everything else in my order would have been shipped free. And you can get them at your neighborhood Radio Shack for the same price as here. I got a HI-MD recorder instead of an I-Pod and I'm glad I did. Just don't buy the disks from Amazon.
2,Good looking but very cheap construction,It looks just like the movie car but the plastic is cheap and some part were broke in the box. Others broke off with minimal play. Also the paint comes off very easily and some parts had a scuffed up look to them (again just out of the box) This could have been constructed much better. Also the figures do not fit in the car very well.
1,B95 Canon Fax Inferior Product,"Much surprised with the B95. Bought 1, did not work out of box. Returned for replacement and sent one fax from replacement and it stopped working altogether. Returned for second full refund. All this i within first 30 days. I own Canon MP600 printer-copier-scanner and it is wonderful. I need a fax and am a little worried about any of them at this point."
2,Reviews,"I still havn't recieved it yet, and it said it will come by january 22nd. Hopefully i will recieve it in the next few days."
4,Solid read,"I thought this book was well written & interesting... hard to put down. Not perfect, but worth the money & I'll be keeping it in the library for another read in a few years."
4,Nothing new.....,"If you've been a fan from day one, then you already know the story. He didn't realy go into detail about what I wanted to know (his workout and being able to build himself back up from being shot). The CDs, especially Get Rich's bonus DVD tells this story better. But, I still read it very fast, so I would call this an easy read."
5,Lotus Maual,My husband purchsed an older Lotus Elan and this manual was perfect to guide him and answer his questions.
1,Waste of good plastic,I gt this in case we had a power outage. We had one from an ice storm. No matter how long I cranked the battery would play no longer than 5 seconds. A complete waste.
2,Alert,"I was very disappointed in this radio. The primary reason for purchasing a weather alert radio is to be alerted when the radio is turned off. This radio does not alert you when it is in the off position. I probably won't have the radio turned on in the late night, early morning hours. This is when I would need to be alerted to severe weather."
1,Disappointing,"This thing is horrible. It doesn't hold a charge. I can crank on it for 5 minutes, and it won't even last a minute or two. When plugged in and charged, the internal battery doesn't last very long either. The features would be nice, if it would do what it is designed to do. The whole point is to be able to power by dynamo though to sustain power during an outage. If you want to keep it plugged in, it works fine, but you might as well buy a $10 radio. It will work in those conditions. Maybe i just got a defective model, but still a waste of money for me."
2,Not that great.,Purchased this just to have a radio in the kitchen and I'm not to happy with this purchase. The radio is nice but the sound is that of a small cheap radio. I think this is overprice and not worth buying. Waste of money. I will keep it but it sorta sucks.
5,Good value for the money,The radio came when it was supposed to -- works like they said it would just what you expect from Amazon!
3,"Good value, instructions lacking","Biggest complaint I have is that the manual is very poorly written. Doesn't clearly tell about utilizing the alert feature options and why the lcd screen sometimes turns red. Am figuring it out, but a better manual (even checked on-line) would help."
1,Worthless,"This is the secound radio I have recieved.The first one went bad in a month.Now I return the bad one to Amazon and they send me another.When I get it I fully charge it up test it out and put it away,which by the way you have to charge with the unit on,and when turned off it will run down again in two days when not even being used.But I put it away untill bad weather season and tryed to charge it again but it will not charge with ac adapter the charge light dont come on.You can crank charge and it will work for a feww seconds.It is still under warranty untill June 2012,but I dont know if Amazon will replace it or give me a refund it was warranted for a year.Midland used to be considered a step up above the competition but on this product they took a lot of steps down."
4,Won't Disappoint,"The Midland ER102 Emergency Radio has AM, FM, all the Weather Bands, a flashlight, a lighted tuning display and an alarm that would raise the dead, for both bad weather and freezing road conditions.It runs on rechargeable batteries (included), AAA batteries (not included), AC (adapter included) and a hand crank (which recharges the rechargeable battery pack). It does everything reasonably well, and emergency warning very well. Two minutes of hand-crank recharging gives you 30+ minutes of radio use.If it had solar recharging cells, it would be as close to perfect as anything in its class. Definitely worth the price."
3,Midland ER102,"I like the fact that it's got digital band selection. However, the reception on certain stations is not as good as my previous radio. For the stations that come in loud and clear, it's a great buy."
2,Almost Good,The reason I say almost good is that the picture quality is very good...But the music sounds like the producers recorded it from the Wheather Channel.I think Madacy could of done a better job.This video was not worth the money....
2,Collapses into a shambles,"I really like it when a book clicks in - when the a-ha moment happens and you get it. Realization happens and you feel fully connected to the book. All the author's misdirections lead inexorably to this place, and no further explanation is needed or desired.I DON'T like it when an author spends about 120 pages explaining the ending of his/her story, which is what's going on here. For 300 pages I really enjoyed Past Caring - good characters, mystery, good writing. But the drawn-out ending was ramshackle and arbitrary, with people's motivations puzzling and nonstationary. Martin goes after that girl? Come on."
5,Bionomics Part 2,"What we Learned in the Rainforest is a brilliant presentation of both the theory and practice of sustainable development. Its the best portrait yet of the power that comes from harnessing the energy of complex systems to grow profits and preserve our environment. Bill Shireman once again demonstrates his ability to rise above the dead end debate between jobs and environmental protection and with his co-author proves there is a third, better way. For those who loved Bionomics in the 90s, this book will provide new ammunition and ideas to carry the cause forward in the new millennium."
5,Great primer on sustainable business principles,"Bill Shireman and Tachi Kiuchi's book is an accessible, well written treatise on the economic and social power of applying natural principles to business. Unlike other books on industrial ecology, which can be heady and boring, Shireman and Kiuchi have broken down the natural cycles of the Rainforest into easily understandable principles and then provide brief case studies illustrating the application of those principles in a business setting. The book is a great primer on corporate sustainability."
4,Cute shoe,An adorable shoe that fits well. A little uncomfortable at first but to be expected with new shoes.
3,"Good news,Bad news., Again...",Yes...same person. Different addy. :pFirst the good news-it lists all 108 plus recruitable characters and how to get them. Lists of items plus secret items.Different unit attacks a map of the HQ and all of the secrets. And the bad news--if you like RPG's for the storyline don't read this book! It's one BIG spoiler... And I hate when a book does that.Oh....and I like the thick paper the book uses.
5,My husband loves this knife,These knives are great for cutting bagels for breakfast. My husband loved it so much that he has to have two so one will always be available.
1,Disappointing,"Having previously read ""Fundamental Financial Accounting Concepts"" by the same people, this book was a disappointment. It came off as incredibly dry, and was not all that clear in its presentation of the concepts. The ""Fundamental Financial Accounting"" volume is great, but I'd recommend another author for the managerial book."
1,Disappointed.,"I had hoped to learn more about kaleidoscopes. It has great pictures. I just started collecting kaleidoscopes about three years ago. Even a novice, who loves to do research, finds this book lacking. I see that many don't believe it is missing some great artists and scopes, so I recommend great starting points: 1. the author's previous books, 2. [another website]. I do recommend that you look at Boswell's book and if you can get it, Gary Newlin's books. They don't seem to be ""putting in plugs"" for specific groups and artists, but just want to share information. This book does have some very good pictures and some good comments, but you know who the author loves and not who really should be included."
1,Disapointed,"The book is severly lacking in the technical detail I was seeking. Had I known this, I would not have made the purchase."
2,Weak book,"This book has little in it. The first large section covers very basic information, including nail sizes. If you need beginer information, that's fine, but there are better books for that than this one.Most of the projects in this book are simple, and illustrated with cheesy computer drawn images. If you want to build cabinets or built-ins there are much better books than this."
4,a good read,I did enjoy this book. I read it on a car trip and it actually kept me awake (car rides put me to sleep no matter what I am doing usually). I felt so bad for Stacy and I too have had babysitting clients who try to make me do house chores on top of watching the kids. You could really feel her stress in this and I loved to hate the women who she was working for. Definetly a good read if you're a fan of Stacy!
2,Tastes like field grass,"My husband and I are longtime Oolong tea drinkers, as a matter of fact, Oolong tea is his favorite choice of hot tea. For some reason, we cannot find Oolong tea at any of our grocery stores anymore. We finally came across the Twinings brand, but our excitement soon faded with our first cup. This tea has a distinct field grassy flavor and not in a pleasant way either. If I could just find any of our old brands, I would really be excited. We used to purchase Bigelow and Meijer brands but have been unable to find either one for some time now. I think we will try our local Chinese restaurant to see if they sell this tea by the box."
4,Great Sci-Fi Libertarian Socialism,"Scottish writer Ken MacLeod has emerged as a key voice in the modern libertarian socialist movement. This book, the first installment in the Fall Revolution series, is a superb political thriller totally saturated with an amazing array of characters from the progressive-left - with a few rads thrown in for good measure."
4,Romano's Revenge,"I liked this book for the most part. It was a good sequel to Matt's story in THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE. Anyways, the book is about Joe and his new cook, who can't really cook, Lucinda, who he constantly refers to as Lucy (to her utter annoyance). Joe's Nonna set them up in a big scheme that you will understand if you read the book. Joe thinks Lucy is a lesbian, and Lucinda thinks Joe is gay, but neither is gay or lesbian. They are very attracted to each other. They had a really odd meeting, her jumping out of a cake at a bachelor party for one of Joe's friends, and the story just progressed to weirder as the book went on. Now, her female characters are a lot alike, they all say they don't want the male character to kiss them and whatnot, but they always succumb to temptation, so in that way, this book is very similar to all her others. But nonetheless, if you like a quick read, and you enjoy her stories, you will probably like this book."
1,"Great Title, Disapointing Book",There is nothing new here for the real enthusiast. It also fails as a coffee table book for the casual Porsche fan. The title and the author make this a very misleading book.
5,Tough to beat.,"I've had this set for 6 months now, and am extremely happy with it. They are far superior to the less expensive Henckels and Wüsthof sets. I wouldn't go as far a saying they are the same quality as the top of the line Henckels and Wüsthof sets, but they are very close and cost a LOT less. No problems with rust or discoloration (the maids even ran the chef's and paring knives through the dishwasher by mistake). The stamped steak knives are not the best,(I have the forged steak knives as well)but they work good for everyday tasks. All in all, you can't go wrong with this set."
1,Parents don't buy this book!,"This book has cute pictures which may interest children, but its text is inaccurate and incomplete. If you use these methods on any breed other than a small toy breed you may end up with problems in the long run. Instead read ""Puppy Preschool"" by John Ross and Barbara McKinney."
1,Won't waste money - nonsense.,"What a waste of money. Don't bother buying this book, in fact I will be avoiding anything written by this author (We have another one of his - an older one and the thinking has not changed in this one one bit). IMO, There are way superior books for kids, parents and families on how to get started with training that are more dog and people friendly and will acheive the same results."
1,MXZ Saw- Horrible Product,I saw the ad for this product on TV and thought it would be a great item. This is truly a piece of junk. I have never written one of these reviews before but I felt I must warn potential buyers about this product. It does not cut glass. It was barely able to cut through cardboard. I tried to cut a pine tree branch and the whole blade bent. Stay away from this product.
1,Deceptive Advertisment,"If this thing would ever saw through metal or ceramic it would take forever! Might work well for drywall, but doesn't cut anything hard."
3,"product is not freshdoes not show date of expiration and it has a funny taste, i love this product but i am not satisfiedn with","product is not fresh, does not show date of expiration and it has a funny test. i love this product as you know since i have ordered once or twice before, i hope my next order of this product is fresh and eatable."
4,Great book for understanding the differences between boys and girls with ADD/ADHD,"This is a very good book for assisting parents in understanding the different ways ADD/ADHD presents in girls than in boys. I found it very useful in understanding some of my daughter's behaviours. This book describes, in a very helpful way, some of the ways a girl adjusts to ADD/ADHD as she grows and the different responses she may have to dealing with her ADD/ADHD."
4,She loved it,My wife's aurthritis doctor recomended the ulu knife and she fell in love with it. I love it because I can spit a frozen roll of hamburger with it. She loves it because it dosn't hurt her wrist to use and she can dice food very fine and quickly. So we sent one to our Moms for mothers day this year and they both loved it.
2,"I know this is a seminal book, but it's so hard to finish it","I picked up this book because it is a seminal book in the cannon of black queer literature and I thought I should educate myself. just couldn't finish this book because the writing style drove me nuts. I hate most chick lit due to the writing style and obsession about clothes, and the writing style is kinda like that (complete with description of outfits). I keep plugging away every so often because of what the book represents, but it is so hard.The sad thing is that underneath the the crap I hate (the writing style, the outfit and hair descriptions) is a very interesting and worthwhile examination of male love and the construction of gay male identity and black masculinity in general.There is a reason these books are considered groundbreaking, but I just dislike the writing style so intensely."
5,This guy is a idiot,Did you really tought that he was Rakim as in Rakim & Eric B fame? Damn you are dumb I mean did you really think that the God Rakim was spitting Reggaeton? I mean was your post a joke because if it is I will apoligize to you but if it ain't you sir are a buffon. And unlike you I will now review the product by saying that this is a good live cd & dvd combo that will be enjoyed by any real fans of Rakim & Ken-Y There was that hard to do guy? and please nobody pay attention to this fool and he's review Shenanigans.
5,machine oil is wonderful,Product arrived quickly and it works just fine. That's all I have to say!What else is there to say. Period.
1,NOT what I was looking,EXCELLENT GOOD PRODUCT BETTER THAN EXPECTED THANKS Do explain why you liked or disliked this product Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.
4,Pretty book with a lot of pictures,"As a person learning woodworking, the title of this book made it look like a project saver to me. The day the book arrived I was worrying about how to attach wheels into the bottom of horsey legs because it would mean screwing into end-grain, a very weak join. Lo! a project in the book suggested dowelling across the grain to hold screws inserted into the end. There were several other project-savers in the book, and more may show themselves to be so as I progress. Nice touch: the hands in the photos illustrating the suggestions are of a woman--encouraging."
1,"Small, flimsy, cheap, and fell apart with less than 200 lbs weight on it.","Love the idea, dislike the craftsmanship. The table is ideal for a book and a beverage, but it's no bigger than that and uncomfortable to sit on. My 180-lb husband stood on it to hang some tarps at our campsite and it snapped in two (mind you the weight limit is listed as 250 lbs). Used maybe 3 times before it broke. Not worth your time or money. Will try to return to Amazon - wish me luck!"
1,Subterfuge,Your ad does not disclose the fact that this is not a movie.Rather it is a PBS documentary of poor quality and hidden agenda.Too bad PBS does not want to compete with the real world by disclosingwhat it is peddling.
1,SOE shows NO respect for its Established Community,"SWG has lost all connection with its current customer base, thanks to SOE's absolute disregard for customer assurance. The most recent Combat Upgrade has turned a buggy but enjoyable online immersive experience into an unplayable cartoonish joke. This occured while the player based consistently expressed their earnest disapproval."
2,"OK Product, Lousy Customer Service","The game as it stands is enjoyable for the first few weeks, even months...until you get deeper into it. Consequetly, it even won some awards, obviously by people who didn't have the time to play it for an extended period.There are many major aspects that are simply not working, such as certain ""professions"", the basic combat system, so-called ""Galactic Civil War"" (imperials vs. rebels), Jedi system, etc.The real problem, however, is the lack of development resources to fix the problems, and the tendency of the management to mislead their customers as to when they will be able to devote enough resources to the base game. All (_all_) the developers seem to be working on the extension (Jump to Lightspeed) that will be sold as an expansion packet.Given their track record, I personally cannot recommend either the base game, or the expansion in their current state. Unless you want to waste it, go spend you money elsewhere."
1,The continual beta,"When SWG first came out 22 mos ago was one of the most immensinging onlines you could play.There was PvP action as well as PvE and a number of active careers that would keep the flavor of the game new for ages to come.about a yr after the first appeareance of the first jedi on server SOE devs decided to change the whole format of the game and introduce a EQ style of play that really falls short of their flag ship game.The PvP falls short as well as the PvE immersion, with SOE solely relying on the Star Wars name to sale this product.As a long time vet of this game I would say the 7.95 price on this game is too high."
1,An Empire Divided is an Apt Sub-title,"Unfortunately, the division is between the cash paying customers, and the Sony / Lucas arts Bean Counters. I have been playing, and I cancelled my account as of last night, due to absolutely no customer service.There are many bugs and problems with this game, which is based on Star Wars only in licensing the names and sounds. Perhaps, if they actually finished beta, and released something that was 75 or 85% functional, it would be worth a glance at, but as it is, you are paying for no service, a great deal of boredom, a broken economy, broken gameplay, and very little to do with actual Star Wars.Two thumbs down"
2,Buyer BEWARE!!!! The game doesn't work yet!!!,"As of the first evening of the game being open to the public, the servers are all crashing constantly. I have been trying for 8 hours to play the game but I haven't even been able to create a character!!! It took 4 hours before the game would even allow me to enter my credit card information.Sony and LucasArts knew this was going to be popular but obviously didn't shell out the money needed to buy enough servers. If this is what they want your first impression to be, will they even care when there are technical problems later???"
4,"be warned, its new","this game still has its share of bugs, this is true, but it is also incredibly fun. if you go into this game to become the most powerful person, or to have the best loot, play eq, if you want to have a good time, do stuff besides constantly killing, interacting and roleplaying in a great universe, then give it a go, yes it does lag pretty badly at times, and the requirements are pretty steep, but overall, i find it a great experience, and a welcome breath of fresh air from the camp/loot/uber fest that was EQ. tailor made for the casual gamer to have fun with some friends, and to aggravate the powergamer. no l33t's need apply"
1,went from best MMO to worst over night,"this is not a flame - but honestly, the CU has ruined SWG for me. both of my 1year+ accounts have been cancelled. It all boils down to this- if i had wanted to play an EQ2 or WoW type game, I WOULDVE BOUGHT ONE. instead, i bought SWG and absolutely loved it, until this. i have put up with alot of changes over the past year, as has the rest of the community, but this is unbearable. BOTTOM LINE-- save your money, its NOT a star wars game... anymore."
1,What was once fun... is now dead.,"Do not buy this game. Sony Online Entertainment does not care about the people that pay money. All they care about is themselves. Customer Service is horrible, and none of the developers listen to the games problems. Spend your money some where else. But, don't take my testimonial as fact. Go to http://www.swgpetition.com/ to read about the online petition and see how many people dislike what they have done to OUR game."
1,I Have a VERY Bad Feeling About This....,"I wish this game was good, I've owned it for a long time, this is the first 1 I've given a game. Some people say this game is great, and, I don't really want to be rude, but they were either high or freshly released from the looney bin, or it could have been the first MMO they played, I have to be honest, I liked this game when I first played it, it was the first MMO I played, but after playing GOOD games like WoW or CoH or Ragnarok (yes Ragnarok is better) I was disgusted at the game, it should not have been made. I have to admit that it could have been more, but it isn't what it should have been, buy WoW or CoH... or Ragnarok, just DON'T play this game..."
3,Why all the 5 stars?,"I am very skeptical of all the high marks for this game when it isn't even released yet. I'm in the beta currently, and I can tell you, its no where NEAR ready for lift off. If they launch it on the date advertised here then we are going to see a very shakey launch. The beta is very impressive though, everything is interactive, but that also creates a situation where a bazillion developers have to put detail to all the interactive stuff -- ugh. The commerce system is non-existant at this point, everything costs like 5 credits, so we're not even balancing that yet. I think SW is going to be a great MMO, but to rate it so high right now is ridiculous, it needs to be launched before given such high marks. -- Wookies Rule!"
1,Got worse and is now literally unplayable,"I've tried and tried to like this game, but it had an unbelievable amount of tech issues and bugs from the beginning. Servers down every day, constant crashes, many bugs that just make your gameplay unbearable and a waste of time. Patches only come out every week or so, and the main focus never seems to be on fixing anything, just adding more bugged stuff. After much frustration and not playing for over a month, I now can't even play the game because there are so many patches and bug fixes to download, the game freezes up during download before the game can even load. I'm paying monthly for a game that I can't even play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,G00d Game,Honestly i only played the game for about 2or 3 hours at my friends house. But within that short time also watching my bro play it is a VERY impressive game. You could custamize your character soo much it was scary. I have heard of some bugs in the game but i havent ran into any so far. There are a few updates coming out such as mounts. You capture creatures and ride them. Player cities (make your own city with others and get voted to be the mayor) and things like speed bikes and stuff like that. Overall I was impressed by the graphics on the game and enjoyed it. The many classes and proffesions you could get was amazing. I think its a a good game and put it on your to buy list.
4,"Not a bad start, but will rule in a years time!","Like any brand new MMOLG, STG is plauged with small glithes, bugs and broke things. No worries. The team is fast as lightning when it comes to fixing these and will soon begin to add more content. For right now, it is a shakedown cruise for both us, the players and the designers. It looks really good and is very stable with no lag. If you were a old vet of EQ, you'll pick this up pretty quick. Gone are the old levels and added are skills that get improved. The Graphics are breathtaking and it is Star Wars!"
4,A good game,I've had fun playing this game. I have a nice bit of luck in the mining trade and have joined a band as a master dancer.
2,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME!,"If you want the same old Everquest gameplay with Star Wars characters and places buy this game. If you want a truly evolutionary MMORPG with features like creating your own town, being a politician, owning your own store, creating your own guild or playing as a dragon wait for Horizons instead. I just feel that before everyone goes out and buys this game which will probably be the most expensive MMORPG coming out ...they should really look to see what else is out there. The only thing besides setting that makes MMORPGs different from each other is features and while SWG has the most features compared to any other MMORPG SOE has released Horizons is the one that has the most truly worthwhile, unique features more than Everquest 2, more than World of Warcraft, more than Star Wars Galaxies (Do your own research if you don't believe me). These games are just going to sell because of their names and I'm tired of that happening!"
2,A fun game pre-CU,"Before the combat upgrade, this was a FANTASTIC game!! I have been happily addicted for 1 year and 10 months. Now with the new system in place, I can make no more progress. I am extremely disappointed with the changes and hope they change it back. Until then, I will be playing other games."
1,The Combat Upgrade is a total mess,They have completely changed the game after playing it for a year and a half.. We are basically BETA testing a new game for them
1,*sigh* Why? SOE Why?,"When i started playing the game 10 Months ago I was addicted. I played into the early hours of the morning. I swore i would never Uninstall it.. But in light of Recent events i fear i may have to. The Combat upgrade was supposed to be something wonderful. But it turns out that they've Cloned EQ2. Now you have Less armor to choose from and less abilities. I was a couple of weeks away from hitting Jedi then i logged in to find i had to remove half of my skills leaving me in a world of ***Expletives***I tried looking at it as a ""new game"" i really did.. given it a fair shot but truely my force powers are dwindlingOnce upon a time This game was a Legend, A Giant amongst Men unfortunatly even this giant was eventually slain.If your wanting a new MMORPG to play, Id suggest World Of Warcraft"
1,Where is the Star Wars ???,"This game had the potential to be the best game ever. Sadly, it will never reach that potential. If anything the game has gotten much worse. It no longer feels like Star Wars. The graphics took an even greater departure from Star Wars & are very cartoonish & have no place in a Star Wars game. Add to that the fact that the game is purely designed to be a continuous grind with no real content to be had & it makes for a completely lousy gaming experience. It's a chat room with semi-Starwars graphics... & nothing more. Save yourself the $15 bucks a month & use ICQ for free."
1,Waste of money and time,"Game is totally ruined as of 15 November 05, save your money for WOW, EQ, or if you want SW go for Battlefront."
1,BEWARE and read the fine print!,"If you want this game be sure to check the system requirements carefully. Just because you have a new, top of the line computer doesn't mean it will work. To run it needs a very specific piece of video card hardware that isn't common. Read the fine print - who would make a game incompatible with so many average computers?!?!? If you have one of those game specific computers get it, but if you have a typical home computer don't bother - be prepared to spend several days with tech support - this is why PC games are dying out - console games are so much easier, open and play is 5 seconds. Not so with this game."
1,"Game Over, man.","I concur with the previous posts. 2 months ago I would have said SWG is an MMORPG that is fun despite low content and trivial quests. It was because it was a game where you could play as a single player and still have fun, and group if you wanted to so you could tackle the big stuff. You could also be effective at the PvE aspect of the game and have skill points left over to be a crafter or an Entertainer if you chose to. All that is now gone, to buy this game now is to waste your money paying for this bug ridden game. Don't buy it, your money would be better spent on WOW."
1,Game Ruined by CU,"I played this game on and off for 2 years ...slowly getting my Jedi and Lightsaber. It has all been ruined by the Combat Upgrade. This game is now 2 years old and is full of bugs, problems and still NO content...Skip this game and just go to Wow or wait for MEO or some other online game."
1,"Nice try, but too many empty promises.","I had high hopes for this game. I finally had broadband in my area, and what better way to test it than with online gaming, right? The game in its current state can be summed up in one word:Boring.Run (or jog) for minutes at a time, look for needles in haystacks, kill vermin, and hope nobody kills you. That's about it. Sound adventurous? No space travel. No piloting of any craft. You might get to ride a dewback, if you're lucky.I wish I could find someone to give my copy. To get my money's worth I've given it a dual-purpose: Door stop and paper weight.LucasArts and SOE really missed the mark with this one."
1,Not worth the time or money,"1) not true 3-D: dont look for any underwater adventures or jetpack battles or let alone jumping over a 6 inch ledge...one word phony.2) No space ships until the expansion is released: Launching Starwars without space is like baking pancakes without a pan, pointless3) Player generated content: um this means that there wont be diddly to do ( minimal real loot or motivation for playing) unless you live and die by PVP4) Computer generated worlds: hardly anything is hand crafted. it will be very boring and lacking of variety...see 1 world and you've seen them all.basically you pay ...for a platform that might be ok 8-10 months later..at which point they will make you pay for an expansion. not me, i'll be playing World of Warcaft by then."
1,If I were you I'd stay far away!,"It's not worth the price of the box nor the 15 bucks a month. I spent 2 months playing and then they decided to nerf my character to heck and back. And they're preparing to nerf other professions as well, this is another beta test which people should not have to pay for. I am very disappointed. I was having fun but it's no fun when they release a game that they claim is finished only to have it drastically change in one sweep of the nerf-bat. Anyway you have been warned. Those that like it see the potential. I do too, but it's not there yet, therefore not worth the money to invest. Give them a year or 2 and maybe it'll be up to snuff then and the nerf-bats will be put away."
2,"Fun at first, or for the EXREMELY casual player","This game, first off has many....many flaws, flaws that are still in game 15+ months after release. This game is like i said for the extemely causual player. If your want a game with a higher goal, something to achieve, intense futuristic combat, then SWG is not for you. This game's combat system was horribly broken, instead of all classes being somewhat ballanced, with every new patch comes a new UBAR class or combination of classes (dont even get me started on this) that owns (beats) every other class.In short, this game is for you only if your the worlds biggest star wars fan or have no time to play a real MMO."
1,Only buy this product if you are a glutten for punishment,"I've played, enjoyed, and loved this game since fall of 2003, but Sony Online Entertainment has stripped this game of everything that once made it unique, and has just changed this game into an EverQuest clone. On top of that, their handling of upset customers has been the worst example of public relations I have ever seen. From anybody. The only way I would ever recomend this game to anybody, is if I knew they were feeling down about not being treated poorly enough.I will never do business with Sony Online Entertainment again."
1,Combat Upgrade?,Thank you SOE for saving me 30 dollars a month and 60 dollars on the upcoming expansions. If you hadn't ruined the game I would still be pumping money into the corporate beast.
1,DON'T GET THIS GAME,"A few months ago I just got SWG JLS along with the ""Official Game Guide"" from Prima and Its now useless because of the so-called CU or combat upgrade. I want a total refund from Sony for the Guide $19.99 the SWG $29.99 JTS $19.99 and my 60 day pre-paid Game Card 29.99. THIS is not the game I payed for.It's the only game I know were Healers are not allowed to heal.I souldn't have to pay to be a beta tester this game is so buggy"
1,Star Wars Galaxies Destroyed by Combat Downgrade,"Sony completely destroyed the game by NOT fixing pre-existing problems and RADICALLY redesigning the game. Now the problems are two fold, the old lag and hard ware problems still exist and servers are crashing, losing data and everything we liked about the game is now completely GONE. XP is twice as hard to get, Jedi and Teras Kasi Masters are completely NURFED and guilds can't even hunt in groups larger than 8. It's heartbreaking to someone like me who has played since day one and was looking forward to playing another two years."
1,stay away from Star wars galaxies.,"I would not suggest this game to anyone. Go buy world of warcraft if you want to play a mmorpg, because star wars galaxies has become World of Warcraft, except with bugs and imbalances that make the game unplayable. i have played swg for 2 years now, done about everything there is to do, have a finished jedi character, and i cancled my account yesterday in disgust. I have never felt so ignored and unappreciated as a customer as i have the last month with Sony online entertainment.Bottom line: If you are looking for a broken game with horrid customer service and developer communication, Swg is for you."
4,Most Enjoyable Game I've Ever Played,"This is an entirely new approach to gaming that is years ahead anything else out there. For one, you are immersed inside a storyline that we are all familiar with, Star Wars. So with just that, you're left feeling that this could have happened, even if in the fictious world, it still makes you feel that you are apart of something famous and much bigger than yourself. That aside, the game offers a rich variety of activities, whatever interests you in real life. As if this was not enough, it puts you into contact with tons of other people who are in the same game, making it seem even more real. Its the SIMS meets the Star Wars Movies, definitely worth a try."
1,Combat Upgrade is the death of this game,"What was once a thriving game has become nothing but empty servers. That in itself, speaks louder than words"
1,swg use to be fun,"I played for almost two years, the Combat Upgrade destroyed the game, dont buy this game, it will make you sad. play kotor or kotor2 if you want to play jedi, play republic trooper for fighting, play medal of honor pacific assault if you like action. dont buy another expensive coaster"
1,"It was good, now its crap","SWG used to be one of the best most diverse MMO out there. Beware to all that are thinking about buying this game, it is very very different from what you will read in the manual. The game is now like many other leveling games, except with no content. I used to love this game and was completely addicted to it, and now i honestly say i am sick of it and it makes me want to throw up.I strongly recommend against this game, and rather suggest GuildWars."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.,"I have played this game since it launched almost 3 years ago and I have never played an MMO as great as this... that changed on April 28 2005 when SONY decided to implement a new ""combat upgrade"" for SWG.. since then most professions are useless and combat is a dumbed down version of its former self. Unless SONY reverses this ""upgrade"" DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME!!!"
1,Combat Upgrade... NOT!!!,"SOE's attempt to upgrade the combat system was in fact a total rewrite of 1/2 of the game. Made the game unplayable and extremely buggy. DO NOT BUY this game, or any expansions."
1,ruined game - DO NOT BUY,"the game was excellent before the recent Combat Upgrade, which turned out to be another half finished Sony Online Entertainment product. It has cause myself, and many many others to leave the game. This game NO LONGER has a Star Wars feel. WARNING< DO NO BUY THIS GAME."
2,Ultimately Goes No Where for Most Players,"I am a big fan of online RPG's, and have played Everquest, Asheron's Call, Final Fantasy XI and others. None have disappointed so thoroughly as Galaxies. There are 3 major problems:1) You will quickly run out of new things to do. The few quests that exist are buggy. Everything else is work, not adventure.2) You will need to be a freak with no job and no life to become a Jedi. Becoming a Jedi is the only interesting thing to do.3) The fact that this game exists means that a good Star Wars online RPG will not exist for years to come -- there is no good social RPG outlet for fans of the series.This game has many features that are brilliant; unfortunately one of these is not gameplay. Buy Everquest, or wait for Everquest 2, or play FF XI. Do not buy this game, you will regret your investment."
1,Even before the 'Combat Upgrade' it sucked.,"Even discounting all the people who are upset about the 'Combat Upgrade' this sucked before the upgrade. You could stick a Darth Helmit on a toster and sell it to these people and these people bought this game. If you want a Star Wars themed chat room this is your software. As for a game World of Warcraft is a better MMO RPG. And although the Combat Upgrade is acutally an improvement it won't fix the base problems: Poor content, Poor support, Poor plainning, Poor game play, Poor customer relations."
2,"If you buy this now, you will pay to beta test it for SOE","No matter which side of the argument you fall on (Love the CU or Hate it) Tha fact remains it is totally bug filled and the game is STILL unbalanced. SOE has the nerve to tell peple ""we are working on fixes and prioritzing them."" Mean while many classes (called proffesion in SWG)are unplayable and people are paying to play a broken game. Poor business tactics. I can't do that anymore so three accounts (2 day ones and 1 a year old)canceled. If you really feel the need to play a Star Wars game play KOTOR or Revenge of the Sith...games that were beta tested before they were released."
1,The Dark Side has ruined this game,"This was a great game until a few days ago when they forced this Combat Downgrade upon the game, basically dooming it to extinction. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!"
1,Don't waste your money. REALLY!,"This game and the recent work done on it by SOE, is the single reason I will never buy another SOE product. This was once a good game, you could log on and play without spending hours looking for a group unlike Everquest or other online games, but... not anymore. On top of having a huge unfinished patch force upon the live servers, (bringing some of them down for over 24 hours) it was a patch that created huge protest and mass people saying it was not wanted. Let alone wanted in its unfinished full of bugs state. But SOE and their team did not listen. People were banned for protesting and saying they wanted to keep they old game, forum post were deleted for the same reason. To end this review, I must repeat, do not buy this game."
3,gotta love those rocks!,"sweet story about a boy and his female cousin...and rocks out in the desert. eddie herrick usually has no use for girls,especially the stuck up ones. one summer he is annoyed because his female cousin,priscilla,is invited to stay with them while her parents are away. eddie vows to stear clear of priscilla but,when edddie's mom has to go away too,priscilla is invited to accompany eddie to a camp for ""rock hounds""-people who search for and collect rocks and minerals. at camp hancock,priscilla goes through as series of small ""adventures"" and slowly over time,eddie comes to like his cousin and discover that girls aren't so bad after all!"
3,Review for Game Theory book.,"The book is not that good for learning, notation very confused and the examples are not very good. It is an excellent reference because it has all the main results, but not a good book for a beginner."
3,"So, so",It is a well packaged product and is what is says it is. We found the taste to be much less than expected.
2,Sodium high,"A.Z.T.T.T.W.B.S. is, or would be, an excellent base for building a nice pot of healthy soup but for the MSG and unneccessarily high sodium content. A reduced salt version would merit more stars."
5,Johnny English a delightful surprise,"I have seen Bean: The Movie in theaters years ago and wanted to get a copy for my kids who have discovered Rowan Atkinson--with my help of course. Since this set included a second feature I had yet to see, I decided ""Why not?"" because Rowan has never let me down before. I found Johnny English to be a better satire about spies/police than the Steve Martin Pink Panther movie, which I still like. So fun to watch Rowan in a ""cool guy"" mode, even with the devastating mistakes the character makes."
2,Framing Woes,"As a Hitchcock aficionado, I bought this DVD purely for ""Juno and the Paycock."" (The early masterpiece, ""Blackmail,"" has long been available.) While the film is of interest to Hitchcock fans, beware this edition: sloppy framing cuts off the actors' heads in nearly half the shots. It won't prevent you from seeing what's good (and what's not so good) about the film, but you'll wish Whirlwind Media had been more careful in putting this package together."
1,Most expensive paper weight i own,"Great book if you are a scientist, but for the average mushroom hunter it is way too complicated to use. Information is scattered thoughout the book so you are forever flipping pages Ex.Once you get to a name, you have to go to the index w/that name to find out where the picture it's at. Don't it make sense to have that info next to the mushroom name and description.Don't waste your money, join a mushroom club!"
1,wrong wire set! not sure if Amazon's fault or seller's.,"So, I searched Amazon for ""1998 Subaru Impreza 2.2"" and ""plug wires."" This set was at the top of the list. The price was reasonable so I ordered them. I pulled the wires out of the box and I knew immediately they were the wrong ones. I suppose it was my fault for not double checking my selection. But I don't understand how using the search box for ""1998 Subaru Impreza 2.2 plug wires"" returns a set of plug wires for a Jeep Cherokee or whatever V8 engine monstrosity the set of wire I received was for. It was nice that I was able to return them, but I had to pay a ""restocking"" fee. Whatever. Lesson learned."
2,"Should be ""by U-be-down""","This game has very bad performance, don't be fooled by hype. The lag in-game is horrible (unless you play during the off-peak morning hours) even on a cable/dsl line. The servers and down 20% of the time and the login server is always hit or miss. The game would be interesting to play - but it's unfortunate that their game servers are plagued instability and latency - you never get to play. I would recommend getting DAOC, and for Mac users - just bite the big one and wait for World of Warcraft."
2,Better ones out there,HiI did the free trial for a couple of days..the interface is a nightmare..pretty bad graphics for a newer mmorpg.....tedious game play...I'll pass on this and go back to DOAC.
5,True RPG,"Shadowbane is the first game I've seen in a long time that incorporates true RPG capability. With the ability to customize gameplay by building cities, forming guilds and creating all out seiges against other cities, Shadowbane has the capability to become a monster game. However, it it not without it's faults. Many of the bugs and lag have been fixed in recent months. What players my not like is the lack of quests like in Everquest and the point-and-click movement system. Overall I feel Shadowbane is a must for online gamers who want a true RPG."
3,Delays everywhere you go,"I beta tested this game, and up to the last week before they shut down for the public release, there would be delays when moving even short distances in game. This all had to do with graphics loading and positioning other players. I am an avid player of EverQuest and EQ has ""zones"" where there are 30 second delays when moving between territories. Shadowbane eliminates zones at the cost of adding smaller delays nearly everywhere you move. These delays get worse as the number of people on your server or your immediate vicinity grow.I had a cable modem and very fast graphics card, as well as a 1.5 Ghz CPU with 512MB of memory. All these things couldn't make ShadowBane run any faster, its graphics delays tolerable... if you can handle waiting for them to better streamline its performance, go ahead and try it. If you'd rather not be one of the ""paying beta testers"" after its initial release, wait and check the boards to see how the loading delays and lag issues are coming along."
3,General Review,"Ive noticed in reading the reviews that this game rates either 5 stars or 1. The truth of the matter is that this game is very similar to every other mmpog and I find its neither really great nor very disappointing. The game offers some good stuff, like fast lvl progression with disciplines to offer for later game enjoyment (bounty hunting for instance) and some bad stuff such as serious lag issues. But once again you have an mmpog where all you can do is combat, pretty much the same as any mmpog out there. Currently I find the game enjoyable, a way to be able to pass time with my friends without them being over my house eating up all my grub. Will I stay once star wars galaxies or world of warcraft comes out? probably not. But I will get a couple of months enjoyment out of the game and thats all I really ask for my money."
2,big after level 20 gank fest,"if fan of daoc and played on mordred and andred primarly pvp server and love the mass ganking then you are the right type to play shadowbaneit is one massive guild verses guild gank festwhile the leveling 1- 20 is very reasonble it becomes a vastly different game when off newbe island. Ready to be killed lots and even have your own group loot your corpse. Dying in the higher levels gets very expensive due to con always having to be restoredthis is a mouse only based game and the camera views are not ""fixed yet so first person view is not aviable at this timeSo if tired of same ole same ole eq or daoc this is not the game to pick wait for some other up and coming titlesunless of course u like the total pvp and not much pve"
2,not the best,"Besides the fact that it costs money to play, I experienced several problems. First, the grueling requirements it needs to run limits many gamers to games that require less. I have a computer that met all the requirements and then some, plus I have broadband internet, and I still experienced choppy play and was booted out of the game several times. The game itself is a good idea and is fun when it works, but it isn't worth buying if you don't have time to wait around for the game to work."
2,Little use for this pan,"I was immediately disappointed when I opened the box. This pan doesn't come with a lid and most sauces splatter after they've heated. It's pretty small and not much use for anything other than sauce. Maybe a gourmet chef knows of other uses, but I'm just a parent who cooks when I need to.The metal itself is nice quality. The issues are the size and no accompanying lid."
4,Hardboiled Detective Taking A Hit,"PI DET. Matt Cordell is a bum after the state pulled his license for using the butt end of a 45 on a man. An old friend, Johnny Bridges. asks him to look into money missing from his tailoring shop. When they arrive Johnny's partner is lying on the floot and Johnny's initals are scribbled on the wall.Master teller of tales Ed McBain cut to the chase in a spare style. This reprint under a new title, THE GUTTER AND THE GRAVE, illustrates why Mr. McBain will remain at the head of the class in this caper.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
3,"Remember the movies, and buy our stuff!","I really enjoyed reading the book, but it was more out of nostalgia than being captivated by the author. There are times when a scene from ESB is re-created and the book takes you to another point of view not seen in the movie. It's neat to finally see that other side and fill in the missing pieces between ESB and ROTJ. HOWEVER, a reader should remember at the time the book was published it was leading a huge marketing charge to sell books, toys, comics, and video games. That's why generic characters like Dash are around (gee, does he live for a sequal?), and why Vader could possibly be challenged by some tall, ugly green guy who smells really nice."
3,B-O-R-I-N-G!,"I didn't hate this book or anything, but it just didn't rise tomy expectations. There are many other Star Wars novels that were much,much better. The book just-was boring. I found that I was reading it only to finish it, and was not enjoying it. I noticed that near the end, I simply lost interest in it. It wouldn't be a mistake to read it, but don't begin with high expectations. The new character, Dash Rendar, wasn't likeable or convincing-I found myself rather releived when his ship was blown to pieces.A much better SW novel is The Courtship of Princess Leia"
5,Great book! Make time to read this from beginning to end!,"The book was excellent. The tension, and rivalry between Darth Vader and Xzior was good. The authour has a great writing ability as well. The only thing lacking in this book was that XZior was killed to quickly and there was no real showdown between Darth and Xzior"
1,on a scale of 1-10 I will give it a 10,"thos is the only star wars story I have not at all,son I will get a chance"
2,"Characterization, people...","Okay, let's start with some facts. By the time of the Empire Strikes Back, Luke Skywalker was a full Commander. That is roughly analagous to Colonel in the modern armed forces. He was a seasoned soldier with four years of war under his belt. Somehow, I don't think that he would be acting as boyish as he does in this book, especially after the last of his innocence was pretty much stripped away by Vader's claim on Bespin. The characterization of Vader himself is pretty much right on, which is why this book got two stars, but the treatment of Luke Skywalker is simply disgusting."
3,Pretty average,"This book basically kept you entertained most of the time, but very often, I found myself thinking, ""That character wouldn't say that."" Then there's Dash Rendar, one of the cheesiest names in the history of Star Wars, and a personality to match, what happened here? There couldn't be one Star Wars story without a Han Solo, but since he was frozen in carbonite, Steve Perry just took his character, dumbed him down a shade, gave him red hair and a beard, and then killed him off at the end. Good thing he did that, we can't have two Hans running around later. I would have liked at least one SW story without that rebel without a cause attitude. Oh well, Prince Xizor was totally awesome. If you are a Star Wars fan, I suppose you should read it."
2,Recommended for die-hards but not for newbies.,"I bought and read this book soley because it belonged to the Star Wars universe. After all the hype when it came out, I was highly dissappointed. I believe that Steve Perry has a lot of potential as an author but he is no Timothy Zahn. I did not feel that he was as familiar with the characters as he should have been. I would still recomend this to die-hard Star Wars fans: it ties the first two movies together. But I would not recomend it to a first-time Star Wars reader: there are alot of obscure references and they might be put off by Perry's bland writting style"
5,An excellent read,"This is actually my favorite Star Wars book. Perry does an excellent job with his characterizations of classic trilogy characters (especially Vader), and he is a very visual writer. Kudos to Perry for taking on the challenge of writing a novel set in the ESB-ROTJ time lapse, and succeeding in tying up loose ends after ESB. Awesome stuff, and much appreciated by this Star Wars fan.And a fellow Oregonian! ;-)"
5,Finally a Star Wars audio book that holds up,"The audio book edition was awesome, the guy did different voices for everyone, and did an awesome reading that was just the right pace. Plenty of sound fx and music - it was all there. Fun pitch-perfect story, this went by too fast and was great! The comic, game etc all focus on different angles of the same story, so they don't get old either. If you need some visuals, the Hildbrant brothers did like 200 painted cards which fit perfectly and there is a book for like $5 that shows them in chronological order. The comic and game both take different angles so they don't get old either and I would highly recomend the behind the scenes book where they use the term ""movie-without a movie"" because this truley wasa massive undertaking worthy of the fans time, and multi-media/toy tie-ins."
4,Just Part of the Puzzle,"I've read many reviewers complain that this story is plagued with plot gaps and holes... and that's definitely true. This story was written to go along with the mass marketing project of the same name. To get the full story of ""Shadows"", you have to read the comic book and, in part, play the Nintendo 64 video game. When the three are in combination the story flows much more smoothly and the entire experience is more enjoyable. Without the other two the book can definitely get... annoying."
1,A Major Disappointment,"While the overall story idea was interesting, the execution was terrible. The writing was poor, the characters did not behave in a manner that fits with their personalities as displayed in the original films, and did I mention that the writing was laughable. If you are looking for a well written novel set in the Star Wars universe with an involving story I would suggest either the Thrawn Trilogy or the Hand of Thrawn Duology both by Tim Zahn"
4,More like 4 and 1/2 but one thing ruined it,"First I have to get this off my chest what is with all the hype? Perry did a good job here but the book does not deserve:gamesposterssound tracks and comic books.The villian Prince Xzar last of a battered poeple sometimes can be a bit overbearing and in the end I think he was disposed of 2 easily. I mean if this guy is the head of a vast underground empire wouldn't you think he had better armerment then he did?The good part is that the book provides a nice leeway between the events of ESB and ROTJ.I don't know about you but I always found it hard to fasom that our heros hung out for the better part of year while waiting for their favorite smuggler to get out the block of Carbonite. As I always say, thats just my opinion I could be wrong."
4,Pretty good,"This was my first venture into Star Wars books, and being a longtime fan of the movies I decided to read some of the books.The plot was decent, and I enjoyed reading what happened in between Empire and Jedi(and it answered some questions about things in Jedi).Well, I dont think I can say anything positive that hasnt been said before about this book, so I'll explain why I gave it 4 starts instead of 5.There are parts in the book that borrow lines from the movies, and its hard to picture Xizor there with the Emperor. Vader also seems weak in parts of this book, and like he's Xivors puppet(which ruined my vision of Vader as being powerful and only bowing to the Emperors will).After reading this book, I will most certainly continue to read Star Wars books."
4,Ensnaring Story,"An excellent connection between ESB and ROTJ. It follows all of our favorite SW movie characters, and Dash Rendar is wonderfully fleshed out. It is a convincing plot that explains in exquisite detail exactly how Luke, Leia, Lando, & Chewie figure out where Han is, where *Luke's new lightsaber comes from*, and how they plan to set Han free. A good, action-oreinted book."
5,Highly Recommend this Product,This product really works on my babies dry skin and eczema. It is greasy but it has no smell and absorbs pretty fast. I highly recommend this product.
5,"Review on Antitrust, The Case for Repeal",This book is informative and enlightening. It was a good help in writing a paper for my economics class. I recommend it as good reading for any business student.
3,"An interesting alternative to classical, jazz, and pop music","This eight-movement work featuring mostly percussion instruments is not the kind of music you'll come back to as often as a Beethoven symphony, a Coltrane album, or even a classic 60s Bob Dylan record, but this stuff should not be compared to any of those types of music.""A Journey Through Time"" features such instruments as synthesizer, flute, and various percussive instruments. The artists take you through the beginning of time, through the end of the world and finish with ""A New Beginning."" Some of the conventions used to reflect periods like ""The Industrial Revolution"" are banal and their interpretation of ""The 20th Century"" seems completely off-the-mark to this listener. However, if one concentrates on the sonorities of these arrangements and ignores the idea of what should specific epochs sound like he will find this CD an interesting - and at times compelling - alternative to most types of music."
3,great stuff for the worst case of adult add ever!,"Update- maybe i got too excited about this product, didnt really work in the end- think it was just psychological-this stuff works:bottom line. I have suffered from inattentive ADD all my life, forgetting names, places, parking, having reading difficulties and this year i buckled down and decided to do EVERYTHING in my power to correct this. I have taken fish oil, ginkgo,did lumosity, took b vitamins, just ordered attentive kid, got a prescription to ritalin and strattera, have tried to get in some exercise, meditation, n-back games... all i know is something is working! because for once i can actually think less foggy. It not perfect, i'm still a ditz but to a lesser degree and less often. I have definitely noticed a difference with this stuff.. just feel more confident.. more together... like my brain went .. 'ahhh, that feels better, thanks'. So I would definitely give it a try. It can't hurt... but it can make a world of difference. goood stuff!"
5,Pure Bluegrass all in the Family,The Marty Warburton Band has a grasp on Bluegrass combining old and new sounds. Great vocal demonstration by Marty and April and kickin' harmonies...25+ years in the making. Jay and Kelly also demonstrate evident talent throughout. Bluegrass can truly keep exisiting if family bands like the Marty Warburton Band keep producing great albums!
3,NOT WORTH IT!!!!!,"Fun addictive, cool+awesome graphics...that doesnt make up for IT CRASHING ON YOU. You get disconnected, takes a while to login, your realm fills quickly so you wait in a queu, loading characters long, and they have alot of updates, cant play while they fix bugs {cuasing more bugs}"
1,Horrible Waste of ALOT of money!!!!,"This game has been a fun game to start out with.But all of a sudden, I just discovered, they BLOCK you out of the game regularly! After forking over alot of cash just to have the CDs and one month of play time, Blizzard decides it need to strip you of your ability to play their game.Tuesday mornings, for several hours now, is a total block-out. It sickens me that there is no way for me to get my money back for such a horrible piece of software. PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS GAME!WoW is a popular online-RPG, and it is one of many, so please purchase something that will atleast allow you to play it! If you buy this game and get blocked out, you were warned! Your money and dedication to Blizzard means nothing to them, all they care about is updating content for the level 60+ players.I give this game a F- for its total lack of fun"
1,not a great game for all the fees,You can't play this game offlineBattle mode is too user-friendly. All you need to do is one-right-click the monster if you are playing the worrior.Monsters are not spawn fast enoughnot a team-game gameNice graphic
5,A good game,"Everyone, if you liked WarCraft 3 then get this. It is just as good with new stuff, new scenes, and way better graphics. I suggest you get this. It stinks i doesnt come out for awhile though!"
5,Beta player,"Having played the Beta, I have to say Blizzard has done a bang up job. I have played several other MMORPG's and with the exception of one their release product didn't compare to WoW in Beta. I have had this game on preorder for some time now, and I just have to say it's a must buy.The gameplay is smooth, graphics are excellent, and it caters to both power and casual gamers.Looting isn't an issue as the loot options for a group make it easy. Also, everyone in the group gets any quest loot that drops. So no need to fight over who needs it more. You all get it.the classes and races are very well developed with profession and talents filling them out very nicely.All in all, and excellent game. Blizzard continues to live up to it's history."
3,BEWARE: POOR CUSTOMER AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT,"This is a very good game. On game play I rate this game 5 out of 5. Overall this game gets a lower score due to horrific technical support and the fact that I cant even play the game now. I spent $50 on the game and am currently paying $15 per month to play, however, I cant even play it now due to all of the bugs and crashes from the last patch. In addition, the patch distribution method includes peer to peer file sharing. This took approximately 12 hours to download. These patches occur at least 2 times a month or even more.Technical support is practically nonexistent. You wont get a response in a reasonable amount of time if you post on their website. And forget about calling unless you want to listen to hold music for hours on end. If you want a game that includes hours of messing around with your computer's security system and hours of downloading game patches this is the game for you."
1,Internet subscription,When I purchased the game I was not aware that it could not beplayed except using a $15 per month internet subscription. I thought you would have the option of playing it without the monthly fee. The game itself may be and problably is a five star game.
1,Confusing,Did not realize that you were to link to the enternet before playing. The game was sent back.
5,WoW,"if you like the game you probably already have it, if you don't like the game you probably aren't readng this"
5,Fantastic MMORPG,Ive played many MMORPG starting with Everquest but this game has without a doubt blown them all away in my opinion. Not only are the quest fun but dieing in the game itself is made a treat as you spawn as a ghost and can even do quest then. You can do both solo and play in groups with no problem all the way to the max level. The environments and character all are very colorful and enjoyable. For every part that Verant with Everquest has gotten wrong Blizzard has gotten right with World of Warcraft.
4,"Average MMO, but still fun.","I played this game for a few months. It was ok, but it's a pretty average MMO. It didn't do anything different and I wasn't satisfied with its art. It was sort of cool, but I don't get why everyone is acting like stuff like WoW has never been done before. WoW is nice in the way that people can pick it up, play it, and learn the basics within the first few hours. However, it just seemed pretty average to me. While it is a nice MMO and is, in my opinion, much better than Everquest 2, it just is..repetative. I found it boring and quite frankly pointless. I found Guild Wars to be much better."
3,Many questions,"Ok, I will admit that I am 100% new to this game. I have been playing Warcraft for awhile, but the World internet game is new to me. I will admit this game seems interesting to me as I have only been playing for 2 days...but...one thing I do not like is the battle system. Am I doing something wrong or is it it just---you hit----the monster hits back----you hit---etc---until one of you dies?? Is there a strategy that I'm missing here? Can you avoid being hit? I just run up to something and get into a punch for punch battle with them until they drop dead. If that's the way it goes, it seems stupid. All these good reviews make me think I'm missing some element of fighting. The graphics are cool and the game seems to have potential but there has to be more to the battle system. Any advice??"
5,Best MMORPG To Date,"Well 8 million players world wide this is the greatest MMORPG. Amazing Graphics, great game play, fun, changeling. I think Blizzard offers a free 10 trial, so what are you waiting for. Give this game a try."
2,"World of Bad Support,","Before getting this game, be sure to check out the Support forums. WoW (World of warcraft) is suffering from things like...Peoples accounts expiring with no way to get a CC or game card updated.High graphics glitches... make game unplayableHigh rate of computer lock ups/freezing and Blue screening.Blizzards support staff, ask the users to update drivers.There latest patch has caused a large amount of players to be unable to play at all!!So make sure that your computer won't have these issues. Even though systems with 2gig of ram and the best video cards have issues, maybe yours won't!I recommended waiting for Blizzard to finish the stress test, they call ""GOLD"". Instead get any other MMORPG...none are having the issues this one has.If you do buy it and can't play, please note that for the last 5 days Blizzards support line has been ringing fast busy... hehe."
1,disappointing,"We were not able to get the game to start. It took forever to download, we gave up and sent the game back. Very disappointing"
5,Entertainment Perfection Achieved,"I've been playing this game for about a year now. I've heard that it can addictive so I do not allow myself to play for more than two hours at a time, or more than once per day. Anyway I'll just say it is so well polished. Everything works wonderfully, you can play with your friends or new people with ease. It is very easy to learn, and with all of the skills, talents, wealth, and abilities that you can learn your character will always be fun.The in game world events are fun to watch and participate in. I highly recommend it. And the 15 bucks a month is a mega value for entertainment. Especially when you consider the price of a movie ticket."
1,Terrible customer service,"The level of customer service in this game is beyond horrible. I personally know a few people, and have been a victim of, virtual property being lost during weekly maintenance. It took them a week to contact me back, and another few days to shoot me down and say they can't verify the items lost.And, at level 60, items/equipment is all that matters; with every week having a fear of something important being deleted leaves no room with this game.Though, its pretty fun up until 60 when the armor you get then becomes important, then gets deleted by Blizzard."
3,Phenomenal Game but Horrible Customer Service,"World of Warcraft is easily the most fun game I have ever played. It if fast-paced, there is a huge world to explore, and the fun of interacting with other ""real"" players (vs. computer players) adds a level of realism that's just not possible with an offline game. The game gets five stars for fun.Unfortunately, customer service for the game has to get a 1. Patches to the game (which are fairly frequent) can take upwards of five hours even with a cable modem or DSL, customer petitions in-game for things like being stuck in the scenery are answered rarely if at all, and postings to the technical support board are often ignored or users are told to simply uninstall and then reinstall the game--a process which takes hours.I'm hoping these issues will get better in time, but as much as I love the game, it's not fun having to spend 3-5 hours tweaking your computer/reinstalling after every few hours of play."
1,motnhly fee????,"To be honest I didn't purchased the game although I am a Blizzard and Warcraft fan (I played even the first Warcraft!) But this 15$ fee!!! It doesn't make any sense, after you pay like 50$ to the game. If they don't change this they will kill World of Warcraft. I was planning to buy this game but after I saw the Guild Wars (Free online play) I purchased that and I am happy with my decision. 15$ monthly fee? How long they will keep this fee after a year or so will they find anyone to pay this fee? And if they decide to remove the fee what will the players say who paid the fee till then? They are just helping the makers of the games like Guild Wars."
4,"Fun but takes a lot of time, aka your life.",Its a fun game to play with some friends but dont get too hardcore into it because it will take over your life.
4,Sweet!,"This is a really great Trance Track. I really liked it. I beleive there are 5 versions on this Cd. Including a Dub and Trance Version.Nadia's vocals are sweet and relaxing. There are thumping beats that sound really great and well arranged with Nadia. I do recommend this single for fans of Electronica, Trance, House, Hard House, Techno.So if you want to dance and listen to something new and catchy, this is for you.I hope my review was helpful."
2,History Lite,"I admit I enjoyed the book as light reading. And maybe that's all it's supposed to be after all. But the history in this historical fiction was so loose as to be a distraction to me throughout the book. William Wallace, a famous Texas Ranger, didn't even show up in Texas until late 1835 or 1836, much less get washed up on the beaches of Mexico. But it does deliver a feel of the times that carries you through. Try The Borderland, Gates of the Alamo, or Promised Land for more ""historical"" fiction that also delivers a great story."
2,A Zorro Imitation - And Not A Good One!,"The author attempts to depicted a giant of a man with red hair who is a demon knife fighter and all-around good guy in the period when Texas was finding its freedom from Mexico. He cannot bed the lady he loves because she is married to some old geezer. Are you still awake? Maybe if your readers are all males about sixteen years old you can get away with this twaddle. But once they reach any age and have read a few really good books, this sort of thing is laughable. The Red Ripper, INDEED! Why not The Chartruse Carver? Why not The Scarlet Skewer? Why I read this book to the end is a mystery that will haunt me. Also - the ending was monumentally unsatisfying."
4,Good work knife,"While I got this knife as a gif and I don't know if it was bought at Amazon, nonetheless, I thought that a review would be helpful to potential buyers. The knife is well made and well balanced, holds its edge well, and does not stain easily. I recommend it for smaller cooking jobs where a chef's 6 or 8 inch knife would be an overkill. I also own other Calphalon's knives such as 8 inch cooking knife and like them a lot."
3,"Good quality, cheap price, just not interesting enough to an infant","Good quality, cheap price, just not interesting enough to an infant. My 11 month old used it a couple times, and now uses it only when we coax him for some time-this has now become one of many decorations in his play area."
3,little sci-fi,"I liked this book a lot but some parts I didn't even understand. The book was a little different from what I read but despite that it still was a good book. I loved the ending of it and I hope to read Ambergate and put a review in about that, but before you read Ambergate read Murkmere because if you read Ambergate first I'm guessing things will be really complicated to understand. Anyway back to Murkmere I think that the whole belief that birds are sacred was a little stupid but who know's what people believed back then. Anyway I liked the book and hope you read it and enjoy it"
1,Couldn't get much worse.,"Oh dear. I figured this was one of those '70s movies that has a thin plot and poor acting. Unfortunately, I was VERY correct. The ""plot"" consists of showing quite a few naked women. Sure, there's nothing inherently wrong with that. I would just like to be at least mildly entertained by some sort of interesting dialogue. ""Revenge Of The Cheerleaders"" is definitely a flick only for die hard fans of the mindless '70s T&A genre. P.S.- Hasselhoff is nothing more than an extra with a nude scene in this film. He is not one of the main characters."
5,Instructions from a professional builder,"This book gets to the point with the basics showing how to do a job in detail with clear, concise instructions and drawings showing details that ensures professional performance. A must for a builder or tradesman engaged in the construction trades. I wouldn't start a job without it and I've been in the construction business for a good man years."
2,A good read if you like reading textbooks.,"If you are looking for inspiring, learning experience detailing the business of being a contractor/builder, skip this title and keep looking. I found this book to be a very slow, textbook-styled task of a read."
3,Maybe it's more fun with Gameboy,"Having played in 1-player mode against the CP, I was expecting a great 2-player game. We don't have Gameboy so we don't have transfer paks. I was surprised we were locked out of every battle mode that allows you to choose Pokemon to battle with. In 2-player mode (no Gameboy) the computer picks your lineup for you.Caveat emptor: they want you to buy more gear.Otherwise this is a good game."
1,Game didn't work,"This game wont play, the boys I bought it for were totally bummed :( I am not happy with this experience."
1,Boring.,"This game is boring because it's all the same. If you get a different pokemon, it doesnt matter. you do the same thing over and over. You attack and beat and attack and beat. It's too easy too. I thought Pokemon Snap was MUCH better! That game was one of my favorites. This game just has no point. Fighting is the only thing you do. I mean the gameboy pokemon was better than this one! You get to go on an adventure and find things and get items! That was fun. This is fighting ONLY. Boring! If you want a good pokemon game get any of them for gameboy including Yellow, Blue, Red, Gold, Silver. Or even better, get pokemon snap!"
3,pokemon stadium=fun?,"When I first bought Pokemon Stadium, I would play it almost everyday. I never got tired of the kids games. The battles are kind of boring though. graphics take too much time, and on the game boy, there is more variety in the battle."
2,Disappointing Game,"Well in my opinion, the game started out the best thing I played all year even though I had Sega Dreamcast. Then about 25 to 30 minutes after playing the game, I found it quite boring. All they ever did was just stand around like zombies while I hold the controller with one hand picking which of the four moves they had and use it on the opponent. While the announcer with his annoying voice talk his head of about what I just did. Don't get me wrong, the game was not that bad I gave it a little credit because the graphics was out standing. They could have made the game better like they did on game boy by making us go on a journey to become the best pokemon master, but nooo! they made us stand around all day and wait for somebody to do a stupid attack. By the way, the graphics are ""OUTSTANDING""!"
4,Great Game,This is a great game. If you like pokemon get this game. They have a lot new all over. The only bad part is that sometimes it gets boring and frustrating. A cool thing is that it comes with a free transfer pak. If you have a game boy to play on the n64 it's even more fun.
3,Smiles,"My 3yr old son loves this game. He askes me to say whats on the screen and then he just goes to town! I could spend hours watching him be happy, but he only gets 30min tv time. Its fun for him, and he likes the mini games the most."
2,A big thumbs down,"The only reason this got two stars were the mini games which aren't near the quality of Mario Party games or pretty much anything else. What this game is is the annoying random battles from RPGs without the fun magic systems, plotlines, or general gameplay. Transfer pak adds nothing to the replay value and will be worthless on the n64, avoid."
3,Pokemon hits the N64,"Pokemon Stadium is, to me, a sever disappointment. With the release of Pokemon Stadium 2 (it's much better, I have it) it has been totally outdated. However, it is only available in Japanese. If you don't want an import game, then this is for you. It is, once again a turn-based game. What gives this game its stars are it graphics, which are out of this world."
2,I threw half away,It's a shame that Garmin won't allow you to buy the individual components in case something gets lost.I had to buy the whole mount just because I needed the rod connecting the base to the Nuvi 'holder' for the portable friction mount.
1,Temporary adhesive does not stick,"The temporary adhesive that comes with this unit is MUCH too weak to hold the Nuvi 660. The mount starts giving way almost immediately. I can't understand how Garmin can sell this for the Nuvi 660.I want to be able to move the mount between vehicles, so I can't use the permanent adhesive. I am returning the mount."
4,Pan Base For CCTV Camera,"This remote control Pan Base is a nice addition to a CCTV camera. The mechanism is smooth and has a good speed, not to slow and not to fast. It would have been nice to have presets so you could set it for 160 degree scan when you didn't want a complete 360. Also the instructions suggest not to use in the rain. But for the price I am satisfied."
2,"""A"" for effort and little else","While the text introduction of aikido is commendable, I thought that the quality of the photographs of this book was poor. Major shortcomings were graininess and lack of flow from frame to frame. Furthermore the angle of photography was poorly mapped out. Another major problem (in my opinion) was the insistence that both uke and shite wear hakama, which resulted in poor comprehension as to foot positioning. I have heard that Mr. Sosa is a very capable aikido teacher; in this sense it is a shame that the book does not do him justice"
3,"Does the job, tip very useful, canning season will tell.","This knife will probably last forever, but the sharpness was a disappointment and I felt the serrations were too widely spaced. When coring, cutting, seeding, skinning bushels of tomatoes, the knife is important.However, it is strong enough for cutting bagels. I like the tip for coring tomatoes and apples, de-seeding and peeling the tomatoes, and for de-ribbing peppers."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I bought the -MAC version of this adapter one day at CompUSA because I needed to connect my Newton to my iMac. The first thing that I found out about it is the drivers are *very* buggy. The adapter also had to be plugged in when I booted up the iMac or the drivers wouldn't see the adapter. Same if I unplugged and replugged the adapter while the machine was running. So much for USB hot-pluggability!Also, Belkin couldn't even be bothered to release Mac OS X drivers for this adapter. Though, considering the state of the OS 9 drivers, I don't exactly know if I'd want them.All in all, you'd be better off with one of the USB-Serial adapters from Keyspan. (USB-PDA or High Speed) I'm going to pick one up as soon as my budget allows."
1,A truly horrible pan,"I bought this pan after hearing my friends rave about Calphalon pots and pans. This pan performed so poorly that it will be the first and last time I will ever be suckered into buying anything Calphalon. After three uses I ended up throwing it away - a total waste of money.So what makes it so bad? First of all, it is a nightmare to clean. I've never had a nonstick pan be this much of chore for clean-up.And after it's third use, it pretty much buckled, causing me to throw it away.I'm sticking with the tried and true All-Clad from now on. Don't waste your money on this roaster."
4,Worth The Money,"I just received the YBB 2 disc set. I just finished the light and easy. I would recomend it for a beginner because the moves are pretty easy, but you're gonna have to do it more than once to get the hang of it. The instructors are very postitive and as long as you don't mind the ""new age"" approach, you'll probably like it too. Not everyone in the video is a size two either, which is nice."
2,Less than wonderful,"This video was less than wonderful. It had too much chatting,and not enough exercises. Then the exercises it did havewere the ordinary run of the mill kind.Definately not worth the money I paid for it"
2,Too big to be 1 size fits all,"This product does not fit a womens head securely, it rises up to block vision, even if pulled down numerous times, it keeps rising up preventing a clear picture."
2,Too dense.,I used this book for my MBA and found it to be lengthy and dense. One would be lost if he has no basic accounting knowledge. I spent more time looking up other books in the book shop for my revision.
3,"Lingerie modeling, yes. Acting, no.","Let's cut to the chase. The only nice thing about this movie is that the so-called actresses are dressed in one of the cutest collections of slinky babydoll nighties of any film ever made. The lingerie is comparable with Coppola's forgettable ""bellboy"" movie from the early '60s.The acting is simply awful. There are several cameos by long-cancelled TV stars (Car 54's Ross, Sugarfoot's Hutchins, etc). It's a miracle that anyone's career could recover from such a bomb. It makes you really appreciate Debra Winger's drive as an actress.Don't let the ""57"" date fool you. The only thing that seems particularly '50s about the movie is the music. The nighties are more mid to late '60s styles. There's also a scene where a movie marquee displays an ""R"" rating for a movie -- a rating that didn't exist till the end of the '60s."
5,It's cute and fun! Makes a good center piece,This is the ideal gift for a music (percussion) fanatic. Pair it with the Santana Mini-bongo and they are home run. Attract the attention of every one due to its detailed finish.They sound good too.
4,Inspiring,"The Japanese Bath introduces the art of the Japanese bath through photo after beautiful photo. If you are inspired to actually install such a bath, you will need to consult additional resources. The book is useful for its inspiring photos, introduction to the ""way of the bath,"" and a limited list of resources. Good inspiration!"
3,Sources problem,"Beautiful pictures and instructional text. However, one wonders why the authors included some of the ""Resources"" they did. Some of these have no website or catalogue. Example: Soko Hardware in San Francisco. So, if you don't live in the Bay Area, including them was almost useless. I would have liked to have seen more sources with which one can view and buy items."
3,"not really a ""tank""",This is a one-piece suit although the description and by the looks of it one can not really tell. It fits well if you have a long torso.
4,Helpful,A helpful book describing the various denominations and sects in the American religious landscape. This book has helped me out a great deal.
5,The Best,What can I say? These are the best IF you like sardines. Most people dont! I love these little things with some saltines!! Any they are pretty good for you.
4,"Great puzzles, terrible packaging","These are great puzzles and my son loves them, but the packaging is terrible. The pieces for each puzzle come in a non-reusable plastic bag, with all 4 bags tossed in the box. That means that every time he wants to do one of the puzzles, he has to sort out the pieces first. They did think to put a pattern on the back, but just putting a divider in the box would have sufficed. Supply 4 of your own ziplock bags and it's a great toy."
5,Melissa and Doug Going Places Floor Puzzle,This puzzle is fun - will provide hours of activity for children. Well made - highly recommend . . .
5,Perfect Toddler Puzzle,I gave this puzzle (which is actually 4 separate puzzles) to my son for his 3rd birthday. He immediately spent the next hour playing with it and wasn't even interested in opening anything else. The pieces are very sturdy and easy for him to stick together. The back of the pieces are coded with shapes so that kids can sort them into the 4 separate puzzles. The pieces are large and the colors are vibrant.
2,When good musicians get lazy...,"They apparently came up with a lead sheet that just said ""everybody noodles at once, and then spent 13 tracks trying to get it right. Cohesion is pretty nonexistent, were these guys all in the same room at the time? It's pretty hard to tell. Even as cacophony, it's pretty mediocre. If they'd thrown in a tightly collaborative section here and there for contrast, it would have been impressive, but they would have had to actually work a little bit."
1,shitty product,this is the worst product i ever bought it not worth the 20.00 i got a conferfited bryce harper autograph cards DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP
1,Home Visions misleading sale,"I bought an item from homevisions which I thought was a great sale. It turned out the this was only one part of a set to which there was never a link to buy the other pieces of the desk. Very frustrating and ridiculous. I feel this company, in the way they advertise through Amazon is confusing and misleading. I will not buy from them again."
5,best kettle I've found,I like this kettle a lot. I like that the handle moves down and out of the way so you can put your teapot on the kettle. If you brew your tea that's the best kettle for you. The wistle is soft when the water boils.
4,Interesting book,Good dog behaviour explanations. This book feels more like a textbook than other dog books.
5,"Yes, a book worth reading","Very interesting, and well written. The information was useful, and has helped me with understanding my rescue dog.Reading this book has helped me to work WITH my dog, and not against. Love it."
3,More Scientific than Practical,Very informative and well researched but not a lot of practical advice or tips. The book is better suited for students writing a paper than owners wanting to understand their pet's behavior.
2,Reader in Denver,Was disappointed that it contained nothing specifically on helping a dog adjust to a baby.
2,Ugh,"Unless you're really (and I mean REALLY) into dance music (hard core, not Jennifer Lopez), then you'd probably do well to forgo this recording. Parts of it (""Pop Muzik"" and this version of ""Numb"") are absolutely torturous. There is an interesting, if uninspired cover of ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"". ""Last Night on Earth"" is just boring. I give it two stars because I guess it's okay as far as dance music goes, and U2 gets points for trying something new (not many points, but points nonetheless). However, I would suggest spending your on another U2 cd, such as ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"", ""Achtung Baby"" or ""October."""
4,this semi-discography from born against is a must-have!,"Compiling tracks from the band's history, ""...Shit and Failure"" is a great way to get into this great hardcore band's material. Highlights include covers of X's ""riding with mary"" and the jefferson's theme ""movin' on up"", fast speed punk (""resist control"", ""the good father"") and slower grinds (""I am an idiot""). Featuring most of their 7"" and compilation cuts, this hyper-political band will make you slam and think at the same time. highly recommended. also check out their other releases, ""battle hymns for the race war"" and ""nine patriotic hymns for children"", not featured on this release."
2,The slim is way too narrow for my cat!,"Maybe your cat will like using this scratcher, but it isn't at all interesting to my kitty. It's too narrow for him to want to scratch and he ignores it... which kinda defeats the purpose."
3,Review,"Although the camera is nice and small and easy to take pictures with (with the pictures actually turning out nice), if you are new to digital cameras or are not very good with computers, I would not reccomend this camera because the software is extremely hard to use and confusing"
5,Nice,The filter fits perfectly and does the job. Fuel is filtered properly. The price was fine. I will purchase again when needed.
3,Read the track listing!!,"Be careful!! There are about 3 different versions of this title on the market place, with different tracks! Make sure you check the track listing to see if the one you are considering has the tracks you want.I of course did not, so was dissapointed and had to order another!!"
3,Disappointing for Trinity fans but OK in its own right,"One of three films (that I'm aware of) in the Flatfoot series (with many alternate titles like Flatfoot, The Knock-Out Cop, Trinity Tracking for Trouble, etc.) which star Bud Spencer in a properly tough role with some laughs thrown in. The chuckles and fight scenes may be enough to please Spencer fans, but many fans will miss the light touch of long-time co-star Terence Hill, who does not appear in any of these films. Those not already familiar with Bud Spencer may be unimpressed by this film, and those who are familiar with his more lighthearted films should note the PG-13 level of this film's violence and drug-related themes. For classic Spencer comedies, check out ""They Call Me Trinity,"" ""Crime Busters,"" ""Odds and Evens,"" and ""Go For It."""
4,Wonderful product,"Having tried nearly all of the products out there for self tanner (I'm as pale as Casper folks), this product is by far the best. I wasn't turned into an Oompa Loompa after my application! I had a soft glow that covered my freckles and made my skin tone seem even. I would highly recommend this product to anyone although the cost is a little high; it's definitely worth it."
5,BirdieMaster: simply the best putting trainer,"I own 4 of these. This is the best and most simple putting aid I've ever seen. The rounded design means that a putt that is a little off center will be diverted. The slope of the sides trains for the right force to put the proper pace on a putt. The depth of the cup trains for the right touch; keeping the putt in the cup requires correct control of pace. Changing the rings in the cup trains you to focus on the center using a progressively smaller target. My sons and I used two of these on the carpet for years to putt back and forth. Simple competitions made it fun. Our bulldog Winston loved the competition too. His enjoyment was to chase down a ball, scoop it up, and run away and munch on it. No electricity necessary.The inventor of this lived in Silver Spring, Md. This device should be put back into production because it is simply the best."
5,Purpose Served,It's really cute and totally feel comfortable slipping my laptop in a regular bag rather than paying billions for a stylish computer bag.I love it!
2,I need a break.,"My first thought: this book must have been written by a schizophrenic. Or perhaps someone who really REALLY likes to hear herself talk. I get that this isn't a cookbook -- it's more of a teach-you-how-to-cook but. But it's very loosely organized and completely confusing. At one point she refers to her egg white-filled freezer as akin to a sperm bank (?). Um, yea, now I can't ever look at egg whites the same. But thanks."
4,Inspirational Cooking,"Like many others I bought this book because I'm a fan of Nigella's tv shows. I loved her personality and they way you can tell she really enjoys the food she's making. ""How to Eat"" seemed like a good place to start, and from the get go I was inspired. I wanted to bake a pie, I wanted to roast a chicken, things I'd never done or really thought about doing. She's very encouraging and honest about what can happen in the kitchen. Sometimes the recipe is going to turn out wrong or less than stellar, but I got the sense that she encourages repetition as a way to get comfortable. Can I really learn ""How to Eat"" if I pack it all in just because my first chicken isn't perfectly moist or my second pie crust falls apart? This book helped me tame my fears and made me want to create a personal kitchen history."
5,"Thanks, Nigella.","I bought ""How to Eat"" along with ""Express"" and between the two, I've already made several recipes. Now, I can't cook, but I've been cooking up a storm since Nigella took up residence in my home. The narrative portion of ""How to Eat"" is beautiful prose. I'll even grab the book when I want a good read. Her writing is so descriptive, yet approachable, it inspires even self-proclaimed non-cooks like me to venture into the kitchen. Let that be a testament to Ms. Lawson's gift."
4,A fine story,"This book sneaks up on you. It starts out a bit slowly and has many parallels to The Prodigy but in the last third it picks up the pace big time. The premise is, a woman terrorized by an unknown assailant is forced to move with her family from the East coast out West, but only to find that their new house may be haunted. A police officer and others try their best to help but in the end it will be up to the woman to protect herself and her family. Recommended."
3,Cemetery of Angels,Book had so many mistakes that I sometimes lost track of the story. It didn't seem to make any sense.
4,Bravo!,"I loved this book. It was even better than I thought it would be. I kept turning the pages, so eager to find out what happened next.It captured and caught my full attention. I wish a few more things had been explained though.Like who killed Billy and why?And how could Billy come back for good in his physical body{at least I assume thats what he did , judging from the very end}, when he had been dead for over 60 years?Those 2 parts still have me wondering , because they were never explained at all.The book was suspensful and gripping and had my heart pounding from the middle of the book on. Its one of the best fictional ghost stories I have ever read."
3,I actually learned something from this book.,I bought this book in 04 in the midst of wedding planning. Very simple and a beautiful book. Not too much text but enough to be helpful. She actually goes into details on several good topics one of which was how to prioritize. For example she wanted real flowers so she spent a lot on them but saved by getting cheaper food. I found this helpful. Eventhough I spend way less on my wedding I found things like this through out the book that were helpful even if you weren't having a million dollar wedding. Just good stuff to know to help plan a wonderful wedding no matter how much you spend.
3,Shredded news paper! LOL!,"The books looks kind of dusty, but it looks readable. I think the description should have been worn and old. I appreciate the attempt at keeping the book safe with shredded newspapers."
5,Excellent and pwerful,This book is excellent and has been a bedside companion for years. Its so easy to fall into the pattern of self hatred around body and food. This book helped me see my self and my body from a new perspective and release the self and body hatred that caused the weight in the first place.
1,Company sucks,"Never, ever buy from this company. Received a defective holster and when I submitted a claim they took a week before they even responded and then it was only to ask for a picture, a picture really how stupid! From the most basic cost/benefit approach they blew this one big time. Based on cost, efforts and now the ulitmate cost of losing a customer from bad goodwill they created you tell me how intelligent was their request Should have simply sent call tag (they were welcome to inspect upon retunr) or even told me to trash item and replace it. Buy at your own risk but I will never support companies who conduct business this way."
4,"A brutal, dark look inside the mind of a man on the fringes.","Baum has written the nineties version of Jim Thomson's Killer Inside Me. Unsparing, direct and without condescending to his main character, he captures a mind reeling from boredom and outsider status. A brave book."
3,It's okay,"The product is good, but once the larger part on the outside gets bitten off, the smaller piece stays in the Kong. The hole is too small for my medium-size dog to work it, so she loses interest and the treat ends up staying in the Kong for a long time."
5,Excellent suggestions,"I wish I had this book when my child was born. I have put these suggestions into practice in my home now (he is 9 years old) and the difference is amazing! I highly recommend this book for everyone, especially those with learning disabled children."
1,There are better options out there...,"I was interested in the idea of this book. However, there are far better books out there to help you know what to do to create an enriching environment for your child. The author includes far too many opinions that are not supported by research. I would recommend ""What's going on in there"" by Elliot instead."
5,Amazing,"I Saw them yesterday at the MD Renn Fest, and they blew me away, hearing The Victor made me immediately buy this CD from them. The cover of Kashmir at the end of this CD is amazing as well. Their technique and timeless sound is special."
3,Not the best of the lot,"I read this book pretty well for the Java exam but after the exam found that it did not meet the objectives of the exam fully. Of course, I passed the exam but I would suggest that this book should be just ONE of the many things that you should read for the exam. There are lot of mock exams on the web which reflect the REAL test better. Also, the website javacert.com has a big discussion forum and links to other sites related to Java Certification. Felt let down by the fact that the test engine included in the book happened to be the same questions from the exercises. The authors should definitely have put more effort in building a better test engine."
4,Excellent Book for Certification Preparation,Its an excellent book to prepare for the certification exam . The book covers all the topics for the exam and gives much more information than you need for the exam. After going through it I felt more comfortable with the Java basics and confident to take the exam. I cleared the exam on 30th of september.
5,Wonderful Book for New Programmers,"This is a wonderful book for new programmers. Everything is ""spelled"" out for you and easily understood. We need more books like it!"
5,A Wonderful Adventure!,"What a wonderful adventure! The Duke's Handmaid is a fantastic journey to another land; a place of escape that will pull you in from the very first page. Good versus Evil. Betrayal versus Loyalty. Love versus Selfishness. And through the intriguing descriptions, action and compelling plot, the themes of the story become strong ""parables"" of ethics and morality. This is a great book to read & a great book to give as a gift. I highly recommend it!"
5,"Great album, big mistake...","The mistake is this record has nothing to do with Cheikh Raymond.The artists, ALLA (one of the best Oud player) and Youval MICENMACHER (great and sensitive percussionist), deliver a very sharp and efficient example of a rare north african type of music. It can be listen as a ""relaxing"" music - try it with a good cognac around midnight - or as a sincere ""étude"" of one of the origin of arabo-andalous music."
2,a dissappointment,"One of those books trying to get sold by hanging a catchy name on it, really doesn't have anything to do with Rt 66, just a collection of unrelated, not very well told stories"
4,Excellent WWII story.,Mostly a survival story about hiding out in the jungle to avoid the Japanese onslaught. As well as the rescue by submarine of a few survivors.
4,Twisting and turning like a real river,"""The River"" By Cheryl Kaye Tardif is an interesting book. The story keeps you moving and wondering what will happen next. The characters are interesting, albeit a bit strange sometimes. This book is mostly well written and moves from scene to scene fluently. It seems in some places that the dialogue is almost b movie bad, an example being when the professor shouts out to the main character ""before he destroys humanity!"" still, even the cheesiness of that dialog added something to the book, a brief moment of silliness that made me shake my head and laugh. Over all this book is worth a read. It seems there may be room for a sequel as the ending is rather clipped."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. I thought it would be an action/adventure suspense type story, but it turned out to be more of a romance than anything else. I was particularly disappointed in the lack of authenticity with regard to the canoeing that took place. After three reference to the 'oars' of a canoe I gave up. I find it hard to understand the high ratings given this book by other readers."
5,Beautiful duets from two swing-era masters,"Sweets Edison and Oscar Peterson have a recording history that dates back to the early 50's when they were both mainstays of the Norman Granz stable - Jazz at the Philharmonic. But most of that history is rooted in small swing ensembles that included Peterson's trio and any of several of Edison's cohorts from Lester Young to Ben Webster. This recording has them in an altogether different setting playing off one and other's strengths in a series of standard duets. While both are past peak performance-wise by this mid-70's recording date, there's no real evidence of a lack of power or virtuosity and the solos on each cut are inventive and technically interesting. The material is well-chosen, mostly standard ballads but both Edison and Peterson's background in blues-laden swing comes through loud and clear. Highly recommended."
5,A lovely tea,A very refreshing tea hot or cold.I would not eat black currents off the bush but really like the tea
3,It is not real Acai,"I am dissapointed!! When I bought this product I thought I was buying the real Acai Tea. But when I read ingredients it occured that Acai is the only one of the ingredients from a lot of others. So I blamed myself because I had to read those ingredients before I bought this Tea. I was fooled because the tea is named as ""Acai Tea"" so I thought it really was Acai. I reccomend everybody to read ingredients carefully before buying the product."
3,Ginger with a little lemon,Decent tea. I think the ginger overpowers a little. Average to slightly above average herbal tea.
5,Amazing tea!!,"I will be honest and say that when a friend suggested I try this tea as I began getting sick last winter, I told her no way because I do not like licorice flavor. She still made me a cup and I was stunned. This is the best tea EVER! I stopped drinking coffee during the winter and drank this tea all day long. The students in my class noticed my new love of this tea and bought me a package as a gift. The flavor is fabulous and I really like the fact that I do not need to add any sweetener at all. The aftertaste is so interesting. I have never had anything like it.I prepared this as a cold tea this summer, but it just didn't taste the same. I will stick with it as a hot tea only. Did I mention that I love it?"
2,not as good as Yogi Tea's Lemon Ginger tea,"I am used to Yogi Tea's Lemon Ginger Tea, and for a change I wanted to try Stash's.Unfortunately, I will go back to Yogi Tea's Lemon Ginger which tastes much nicer."
5,Avid Reader,My sister in law is an avid reader of mystery books. She had been looking for it forever. The book came in excellent condition and she could not wait to read it.
1,I Love Lucy Costume,Costume was very inferior to what I expected. Flimsy fabric. Could not use. No instructions for return of product and company very slow to respond to email requesting instructions.
5,Best ever!,I am a huge fan of this butter crock. There is nothing worse than trying to spread cold butter on toast. We are a huge toast eating family and so we use it every day. It keeps the butter at the perfect temperature and it doesn't spoil even after quite a long time. I even dropped on my tile floor once and it didn't break.
3,Not the end of the butter battle,"I had bought this product hoping to settle the butter rage that surfaces every time someone has to try to spread hard butter on something. Alas it has not been our salvation. The butter falls out into the water every time I try to use it. I really don't see what I could do wrong, I measured the water, packed the butter tightly, tried different temps to no avail. During the times it has stayed in the bell it is wonderful, but I spent too much time fishing the butter out of the water and it is now relegated to a shelf in kitchen limbo."
5,Gold Butter Crock,"I have wanted a butter bell (crock) for a long time, but just never went out and bought one. So, I was excited when my new L Tremain Crock, golden yellow arrived. My butter was soft and waiting for me to wash the crock ... it took the entire stick of butter. I just love it - and it is nice knowing I will have fresh, soft, spreadable butter anytime. One thing is that it is more golden than I expected, but that is probably due to my monitor not the description here on Amazon. It was packed well and arrived quickly! I would recommend this to friends. In fact, I will probably be buying some to give as gifts."
1,Don't buy this puzzle!!!! At least not for educational value.,"You have got to be kidding me right? They are selling this product as educational??? I am from Michigan and once again Michigan is not represented correctly. I don't know what the yellow blob is suppose to be, but it is part of Michigan. It is called the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and this map only has the lower peninsula blocked off as Michigan. Please don't buy this puzzle."
1,Disappointed,Purchased 5 puzzles for two grandsons this past Christmas. 5 out of 5 were made in CHINA. Even USA Map 51! Very sad and will do no more business with Doug and Melissa.
1,"USA, but made in China","I was under the mistaken impression that Melissa & Doug products were made in the US, and I especially expected this to be true for a USA puzzle, complete with flag. Not so, it's made in China, and it turns out essentially everything by Melissa & Doug is made in China (though you'd need a magnifying glass to find that on their packaging.) Disappointing. This company will have my support no longer."
4,"I know better,cos I am a Kuwaiti /British lived in there","I am a kuwaiti one of the elite if you want to call me,and I know for sure that this guy is a Kuwaiti from Iranian blood lines thats why he does not look like an arab because Iranians are not arabs ,look in your encyclopedia before opening your gobs!He is a Kuwaiti a very well known one I may add,and I think it is his choice at this day and age whether he wants to practice Islam or paganism it is not for us to judge him.however I disagree with Kuwaitis getting offended when he left Islam so what?who cares?I don't!and the Kuwaiti goverment are the best one in all the arab countries just look at the women they hold the highest positions in the middle east when their neighbouring counterparts are still locked in a Kitchen bare foot and pregnant."
2,A mixed bag,"There are 32 ""articles"" written by sex professionals. The book can be summed up by the insistence on saying that customers should bathe, shave, and tip well. On the customer's side, the best advice is to be clear about what you desire. And if you are into dominatrixes, be sure to remember that no sex is involved.There you are. $9.99, please. And a good tip."
3,Offbeat Drama,"I don't do critical reviews, let it be said the actors in those sets and settings earned their keep doing that movie."
3,Looks interesting,I bought this because I thought the storyline sounded good. But the animation is just a little too busy for my taste.
3,"Great, but gets really disturbingly gross in the middle","It lost two stars for getting unnecessarily disgusting/disturbing in the middle for no reason. Not even just gory, but really disturbing."
1,Most Over-rated Comic Writer To Date.,"Trite, pointlessly inane stories written for folks too hip to read any other artist in the medium. Go read some Alan Moore or Mark Waid."
4,Humble Beginnings,"After enjoying Neil Gaiman's weblog for a few months, I decided to give the Sandman series another shot. The first time round, I found it to be ill-suited for the comics medium, lending itself more to a novel setting.This first graphic novel seems unaware of its future, and seems rather ordinary. Particularly amusing is Gaiman's attempt to integrate into the DC universe, including visits to John Constantine and JLA's Mister Miracle. This is funny because of how I had always considered Sandman's greatest strength to be how far away it seemed from all of DC's other comics, the exploration of a previously unseen world.The story itself is sharp, well thought out and still very modern. I had remembered the writing being top heavy, but for these first issues, I see no sign of it. I found the art to be muddy, but tolerable.An excellent read, blissfully ignorant of its coming success."
4,I didn't know comics could be like this,"I never was a comics fan, in fact the word comics to me used to mean cheap Superhero stuff. Used to, because obviously I had to change my mind after reading this first issue of the Sandman series. A friend loaned it to me, and said that I had to read it, since it would demolish my narrow-minded perspective on comics. And she was right. It's so smart, and sometimes deeply ironic. The intelligence of the writing had me literally pausing at some points to savour Gaiman's wit -- I was fascinated by the Sandman's perspective on hell.So it's supposed to be a graphic novel, and it wouldn't be fair not to acknowledge the graphics also, but it was really a lot of Gaiman's writing that struck me.Read one, read the rest of the series. In fact I've just finished ""A Game of You"". I'd have to say some of the issues are weaker than the rest, but are still of a particular thought-provoking standard."
4,The beginning of a saga.,"A friend of mine had his Sandman collection, so I could start from number 1, then 2,3,4,5,6,7,8, then 10 (It was not complete) then 9 (When we discover that miracles in internet do happen ;-) especially if amazon is in charge)This was the beginning. Everything is not perfect, everything is not what you would expect, if you have read the rest of the saga. Although, there are a couple of moments (24 hours and the hell contest) that make this comic book a worthy addition to your own Sandman collection."
1,Incorrect!,"Product is incorrectly labeled. The 1x port is also a RCA female, not a 3.5mm mono female adapter. Do not purchase this item unless you want a 1x RCA female to 2x RCA female."
3,It does the job. But I only get audio from one speaker.,"I have a DELL U2410, but no TV--as I don't have the space in my apartment for one. Due to that issue, for playing my gaming consoles, I ended up using component cables to connect my ps2 and for the left and right audio, plug into this RCA female to 3.5 female Adapter. It does work well, without me needing to turn on my computer for audio to plug my audio into an RCA female to a 3.5 male Adapter--I can just filter the sound directly to my pc speakers...However, I seem to only get audio from one speaker. Normally, I'd be severely annoyed by this, but as I have good speakers, it's tolerable."
3,only one channel has sound,Based on some other reviews saying they can get two channels and the cheap price I gave a shot and ordered 2 of this. Only 1 arrived in the package and sound only comes out of one channel. I guess the seller is either mixing mono with stereo in their shipping or this product has a very high quality control issue.Spent some more money and ordered this6in. Stereo Splitter (3.5mm) Audio Adapter. Worked flawlessly. Now I can enjoy sounds on both channels from my cable tv and xbox 360.
2,(Mine) only outputs through one speaker.,"I'm only getting one channel/speaker working. Tried different computer speakers and headphones and same results. Kind of bummed, but glad only a couple bucks were lost. Contemplating purchasing another or just taking the one I have and finding it locally where I can have a floor salesmen show me that my second attempt at buying this won't be wasted. I'd like to note that both inputs do work(stereo) as I can tell through the single speaker. It's just the fact that the stereo signal only comes through one speaker and not both when outputted through the 3.5mm. Even if ""mono"" is stated, the output signal should still come through both speakers. ""mono"" and ""single channel"" are not the same thing. My guess is I got a faulty adapter, as it seems so many are happy with their purchase without mention of only one speaker working."
2,"Potential unrealized, expected more","Roddy Doyle can be very very funny, but this book didn't impress me the way Paddy Clarke HA HA HA did. It seems just silly stuff about dog poo. I was really looking forward to see if Doyle could translate his laugh-out-loud humor in his adult books into a children's book. I hope everyone loves this book, and is laughing a lot, but it didn't reach me. There are however a few funny things, many of them to be found in the Glossary on the last three pages. Keep writing Roddy,however, I'm still your fan, and mind the poo."
2,Don't bother with this book,"Roddy Doyle should keep to his adult books and quit the children's book realm. The Giggler Treatment is an irritating, mindless, dog poo-centered collection of pages. As a reviewer of children's books and a child psychologist, I found really nothing that would recommend this book to parents. I'm sorry if I'm spoiling the 5-star ratings other readers are awarding Mr Doyle, but my recommendation is ""don't bother."" There are tons of other funnier, smarter, more enjoyable books for children out there. Let the Gigglers giggle and go on to read some other good stuff. The two-star rating is for actually putting in the effort to bring this volume to print. Literary value is zero."
5,Great kid's book,"I love Roddy Doyle's books for adults so I bought this for my son. He absolutely loved it, so when I had an afternoon free I read it myself. I could see why he found it so funny. It is totally mad and very childish, but in a good way. It is also the perfect book to encourage boys to read, if they need the extra push."
3,Heart's desire.,"Back Cover description: Clare usually ran a mile from powerful, sensual men like Guido Bartaldi. Only, she'd agreed to live under Guido's roof as companion to his wayward ward, the young woman clearly destined to become Guido's wife....Horrified at Guido's marriage plans, Clare soon decided to leave-and found herself all butcaptive in Guido's palatial villa. Then she realized it was she who'd been chosen as Bartaldi's bride.Good sexual tension, plot moves along and all ends well. I only gave it 3 stars because one: Guido keeps on about marrying his ward while romancing Clare, two: Clare's character seemed to collapse about half way through the story and three: the ward annoyed me."
1,Don't bother,"This book isn't well researched and overly relies on several characters for the facts and anecdotes. In the footnotes of the book it confesses quite clearly, ""the reader should not assume that any individual participant in a conversation is the source of the statement, or even among the sources."" It is hard to believe Eichenwald's accusations against Jim Darr (who was never charged with anything) and others, when the facts show they were not found guilty of anything."
2,Burns!,I don't have sensitive skin by any means (regularly do salon or at home peels and micros) and this product was burning to the face. It didn't do anything to reduce my oilyness or shrink my pores. I used it in conjunction with the glycare cleansing gel and I definitely won't be buying either products again.
3,new entry--same workouts,"Denise puts all her butt workouts on one DVD. It's good if you want to add a few minutes to your other workouts, but you've seen all of these before."
4,Sizzlers Extended 8,I love sizzlers as much as when I was a kid..the jump in the middle is the only thing I would change..if it were a criss-cross like the original seventies version it would race better..
1,Total Disappointment,"This was the number one toy requested by my granddaughter. Ordered it through Amazon and it shipped from ToysRUs. Package arrived without a packing slip, looked like it was returned item. The main unit was defective out of the box and both cartridges were also defective. Tried returning it to a local TRU store, but they refused to handle the return. Followed Amazon return process to the letter (except they want a copy of the packing slip which was not in the original shipment). Made a copy of all of our purchase documents and sent the product back. Local store told us that product is no longer available and basically can not be fixed. 60-days later still nothing back from ToysRUs and no refund. My granddaughter keeps asking when she will get to play with her 'Star-Station'. What a waste of time, effort and money only to end up with a disappointed pre-schooler. Thanks a lot, Fisher-Price and ToysRUs."
3,THIS STUFF IS SUPPOSED TO BE SAFE??,"O.K., so this is supposed to be safe for your animal, but it says don't spray it on paint. Well, I didn't know that till AFTER I sprayed it on paint to get rid of ants in my house and it ate the paint. I bought this because it is supposed to be safe to use and I was afraid to use a regular pesticide because of my little dog. Well, it IS a pesticide and I can't imagine spraying that on or near my doggie.I gave it 3 stars because I ended up using it outside to spray around my patio area, but I still waited a day before I let the dog out."
1,Just awful,"My three-year-old cat did not respond well to this product. I lightly sprayed him as directed. He had a bad reaction. He wailed for hours, hid in odd places in the house as if he was fearful, didn't eat nor drink for a day, his legs trimbled and jerked. I had to call the emergency number on the bottle for assistance. I was told by the vet to wash the substance off. Fleas still present after 24 hours. I hand picked fleas off him and sprayed them. I had to saturate the fleas before they died. Substance not as powerful as I thought. Let me not mention the terrible smell of the product."
2,Great look. But...,The look and quality of the knobs is great but the design grabs my fingers and traps them between the knob and the door. I ended up replacing them after a month.
2,WPK Waterbed Patch Kit,"I was rather disappointed w/ the product. Instead of using a glue, the product has a self-adhesive backing that failed to stick properly."
2,Redesigned/rebadged product,"This is, mechanically, the CO2 diffuser/reactor Hydor use to sell (but has since discontinued). AS an aerator, the other review probably is accurate - works for up to a 10, maybe 20 gallon tank for oxygenating.The same issue that was so very common with the same device as a CO2 reactor carries over to this product - the tiny sponge (blue on this model, was black/dark grey on the old reactor) gets plugged up fairly quickly with debris and gunk, so has to be cleaned out fairly regularly or it loses its effectiveness.This is an alternative that works - just know that some maintenance is necessary.And to the previous reviewer - the reason you can't/shouldn't completely burry this in the gravel - it will ""eat"" small bits of gravel and jam or even ruin the impeller. It is designed to be buried all the way to the bottom of the upper housing, so only area where the bubbles come out is exposed."
5,AWESOME CD!,"Anyone that is missing this CD better hurry up and buy it! It is the greatest CD that she has released. And I do rate it 5 stars LOL just like her song, Khams Njoum(5 stars) - NO COINCIDENCE! WE LOVE NAJWA!~*~*<3Nisrine<3*~*~"
1,Michael Bolton Sucks,I recently bought this cd because I am a huge fan of Frank Sinatra and I thought I was in for a treat when I hear so many people rave about Bolton's work. I was disgustingly mistaken. Bolton's voice has all the charm of a date rapist. Poor Frank Sinatra I'm sure the hell he's rotting in is not nearly as bad as listening to this CD. God bless Frank. However I hope Michael Bolton gets cancer on his vocal chords and cannot pollute this world with anymore horrible music. Don't buy this CD
1,bad choice,"He lost his strong voice in week songs, seems his choice get worse the more he gets older. Do not like this cd. Besides it is very expensive in Wal Mart. I could have saved 6 dollars if I got it from amazon. The bottom line it is not worth even $1."
3,Better than his pop -- hope for his career's future,"I need to preface this by saying I never really cared for Michael Bolton. I thought his pop songs were drenched in overwrought false emotion, and he over-sang them (I used to call him 'the beggar'). I even saw him live (the tix were free, though, I really was there for his opening act, Wynonna). All that to say, I'm impressed with this album -- he shows some restraint, and actually *does* swing when called for, and otherwise seems to be in touch with the song's lyrics. Though, he does fall into his prior over-emoting on the last track, ""New York, New York"" -- but, that's a song that's meant to be over-the-top. I don't think I'll ever be a fan, but I reserve judgement for the next phase of his career (which, based on this release, I have hope...)."
1,Nice try,I was quite disappointed in this CD. Michael is no Sinatra and didn't do the tunes justice. The duet with Nicolette wasn't such a good idea either.
1,Excommunicated,"Randall was kicked out of his church. he left his wife and family to shack up with a woman about half his age. He is now raising money under false pretenses as the ""Terry Family Trust"". Beware of this wolf in sheeps clothing. REPENT RANDY!"
3,Works if you don't use the sugar it comes with...,"On our 2nd attempt at it with nothing happening I called the manufacturer. A man in customer services advised me that the sugar packet it comes with is probably the problem and I should use regular granulated sugar. He then proposed something I thought was crazy, but he promised would work. Place a life saver, jolly rancher or other hard candy in the machine after it warmed up and you would get floss very quickly. I dumped the sugar it came with and took a grape charms lollipop off the stick, placed it in the hot machine and got instant floss. The floss was not as soft as regular sugar floss, but it was delicious and my daughter loved it. I have also tried it with plain sugar and plain sugar with a pinch of Kool aid and it worked very well. Clean up is easy, but the biggest complaint is that the floss flies everywhere. We couldn't get it on the stick fast enough and it started flying around the kitchen."
2,Short term fun,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. We had so much fun making fluffy and delicious cones of candy for the rest of the family but soon ran out of floss. I then bought this 4 pound bottle of floss but when I tried it out, the machine broke! Now I'm stuck with a 4 pound bottle of cotton candy floss with no machine to turn it into cotton candy! It's good for a few months, but it will break after awhile."
2,"Did not hold my child""s attention","I was not pleased with this product. It took entirely to long to start making cotton candy. The idea was for my child to make the cotton candy with my supervision, but I got left trying to get a cone full while my child found something else to keep her attention."
4,AN ABSOLUTE HIT AT THE BIRTHDAY PARTY,"I purchased this for my daughter's third birthday party. She had a carnival theme. Visually this item is perfect. When everyone realized it was an actual cotton candy machine the lined formed. It worked for our crowd of about 20 people. You definitely have to follow the directions and make sure is it COMPLETELY heated up. Otherwise, you will get frustrated. Once the machine is at temperature, you can make cotton candy like mad. The only negative is the decorative handle. Ours had an annoying rattle the whole time the machine ran. My husband removed it and it was perfect. Definitely would recommend."
4,Kids love Cotton Candy,"This unit works great. It's very slow but in the end, you can actually spend time having fun with your children creating a treat they will love. Well worth every penny."
3,cotton candy maker,there were suppose to be 2 bags of sugar and there was only one too expensive for what it is suppose to doeasy to clean thoughfound it 2 days after i ordered it at amazon for 10.00 cheaperIf it wasn't christmas i would have sent it back
3,"Great toy, not to be confused with a real appliance","Excellence toy for children under adult supervision and a novelty for teenagers and adults. The machine delivers the product: cotton candy, but only in kid-sized portions. Tastes the same as carnival cotton candy but takes 5 to 10 minuets to get a decent sized cone."
1,Doesn't even last a day!,"I received this machine as a gift. It hardly worked my first time!I tried it again a few days later and all I had was a ring of burnt sugar.I sent it back and received a new one. It worked really well the first daybut then sugar went flying everywhere! I won't even sell this product!I will let this machine sit under my cabinet, coating in dust. I have other Nostalgia products and I'm happy with them. But this is a dud!"
2,not very satisfied,My daughter was all excited but we couldn't make any cotton candy first time we are planning to try again the starting is so frustating it takes forever then it starts to form the candy but not very much .Don't buy it.
1,Don't do it,"Don't waist your money, what a rip off. Takes a long time to heat up, then you don't get enough cotten candy to fill a tube. Don't waist your money."
2,Cheap toy,"I was dissapointed with this machine. I bought it because of the decent reviews it got but now wish I hadn't bought it. IT TAKES FOREVER............ and I mean forever to make cotton candy and the mess is unbelievable. The amount of cotton candy it makes is dismal as well. In addtion to that it is horendously noisy and will vibrate it's way right off your table.If you want a cotton candy maker, spend the extra money and buy a commercial one. That's what I'm going to do now."
1,DID NOT WORK PERIOD!,"Well, followed the instructions, poured the floss in and waited and waited and waited and you guessed it, I GOT AN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, Junk comes to mind. I do not know why, maybe it doesn't get hot enough, but nothing comes out at all. I do not How in the world do so many of you get this thing to work???? Unless the reviews are not real or something???????????????????"
5,Young Children With Special Needs,Chock full of information and easy-to-read format. The vignette's are well chosen and are great examples in action.
3,OK I Guess,"I was a little disappointed in this one. The second is way better by far. Not that all the songs suck there is a handful of good ones The Collin Kids ""Whistle Bait"" and ""Bo Bo Skadaddle"" other than that I wouldn't recommend this to somebody who is wanting to hear the Rockabilly sound (Try ""Ain't I'm a Dog"" for that)."
4,It's Growing On Me,"I was initially disappointed in this purchase. It didn't have the energy or punch I was lookingfor. I was looking for something that might have duplicated the soundtrack to the movie""Roadracers"" starring David Arquette and Salma Hayek. (It was a Showtime movie from the mid 90's.Unfortunately, there is no soundtrack available on CD.) Anyways, it may not be the music so muchas the recording technology of the day. However, after listening to it a number of times it isstarting to grow on me. Besides, it's just really fun Rock N' Roll. I do think however that Iwill look for some more contemporary Rockabilly artists to see if I can't find that extra bit ofpunch I was looking for originally."
1,Not my cup of tea,Would have been nice to have samples to listen to in advance. Would not have purchased this one. Will toss away.
3,African family vacation.,"On one of several trips to Africa Mr Berry Brooks a renowned big game hunter from Memphis, TN. is accompanied by his wife Virginia (Author) and their young teenage daughter also named Virginia. This book is a narrative of their travels fom Memphis to Africa and their stops on the way. It also includes comments of their hunting and daily camp life while on Safari. All three take different game on their lengthly quest to the dark continent. Interesting reading taken from a time when African Safaris lacked many modern conveniences."
3,"Outdated, too simplistic for today's standards","Scrapbooking has come a long way in the last few years, and this book is proof! The samples are too simplistic, the directions are not specific enough, and the lack of ideas for personal creativity is not there. The reader can copy what is given in the book, and is not encouraged how to move on to create a work of art from the given product. Today's embellishments have also come a long way, and not can be seen in the book. A beginner can use the book as a starting point, but after they learn the beginning techniques they must buy a more current book!"
1,horrible,"this book was a shoddy shot at making a quick buck if I ever saw one.the trader interviews were mediocre with nothing of any value, and there were no track records of any kind. The only one I'd ever heard of was Leo Melamed and he was famous for getting the CME on its feet, not for being a trader. Monotonous, inane quotes like ""a trader is paid to stick his hand in the fire.""anyone who gave this book good reviews is smoking crack. i wouldn't pay fifteen cents for this book at a garage sale. I've gotten more trading insights from archie comics."
3,Only Ok.,"These writers probably make a good living writing text books, this book reads like one. How exciting."
4,Old School Book,This book helped to start and solidify a professional gambling craze.It's a must read and a must have for your collection.
3,DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS!,"This book presents the dangers of children's overactive imaginations and their natural desire to play detective. One new man in the apartment building, two strange letters from an ""Agent"" and three snoopy kids plotting to prevent multiple murders--maybe even their own! The tendency of Caroline's girlfriend to speak in imaginary newspaper headlines is cute. It's a silly plot resulting from misconceptions and jumping to conclusions based on circumstantial evidence--all of which causes social concerns and embarrassmet for Caroline's family. The book also suggests that museums are valuable to society. Clever puns and witty dialgoue make this a quick, fun read! This literary recipe represents Lowry Lite!"
4,Looking for a Little Mystery?,"I had to read this book for an assignment in my children's literature class at West Virginia State College. I found this book to be an easy read and easy to follow the story line. I read this book in one day, not because I had to but because I wanted to. I would recommend this book to someone who likes a little mystery in their lives."
2,Museum of the Missing,I thought the topic was very interesting but the book skimped over the deatils - either it was trying to cover too broad a topic or each missing object was not covered in enough depth...there are fascinating stories behind these thefts and I got no sense of who had stolen the art works or why they had taken such 'criminal' risks.
1,awful ending,"This book has an awful ending. Gunderson-Traylor uses her literary license to go too far away from the biblical account, creating an absurd imaginary ending which is not supported in anyway by Scripture and discredits any research she MIGHT have completed in the narration of the rest of the story. I tore the book in half and threw it away - something I've never done before!"
4,good companion to Home Chese Making,"I found that this book was great in conjunction with Home Cheese Making - I found that to be a little more specific than my style, and this was a little more relaxed. I don't think this book is good as a primary resource, but paired with another book or sources on the internet, it's great!It's true that there were some typos, but I was prepared for them after reading other reviews here."
1,You get what you pay for :(,"So I bought this because it was really cheap. Like I said above, you get what you pay for. I used it once, and it started rusting on me....The instructions say you have to sand it and repaint it every time you use it. Not cool! Total waste of my money. If you want a nice fire pit for bonfires you would have to spend at least $100."
4,Dizzy & Arturo,"By the time Dizzy recorded this album, his trumpet chops clearly weren't what they once were, not that he sounds bad here - 'cause he doesn't. Sandoval, on the other hand, is such a Gillespie disciple that this album is like listening to the elder-statesman Dizzy of the 80's playing with the young-buck Dizzy of the original be-bop era. Amazing chemistry - when they play in unison (track 3 for instance), it reminds me of a Herb Alpert record (Aplert's trademark sound, of course, was created by double-tracking his own horn). Another surprise: although not credited for it on the sleeve, Dizzy also blows some funky jew's harp on three or four cuts. (I remember Dizzy's cameo on the Cosby Show, in the 80's. He portrayed the school music teacher of one of the Huxtable daughters, and in that episode treated us viewers to an excellent jew's harp solo. Up until that time, I never new that Diz was an avid jews-harpist!)"
2,Cather Biography,"The Author of this book Hermione Lee is a remarkable biographer and her books on Virginia Woolf and Edith Wharton are fabulous...This book is terrific in its content, but the print is so small it is hard to read even with magnifier glasses so I had to find another copy from another source....!!!!Very annoying & why is there not a hardcopy available ???????Cather/Woolf/Wharton Buff"
3,Does it a HDD support MP3 player?,"Hope it's true,DOes it 2.5"" HDD Mp3 player, Mp4 player?My way:haiitimes@vip.sina.comUS HK IND. CO"
2,"Decent, but I wouldn't buy it again.","I find this really isn't necessary. I could connect the iPod directly to my computer via the USB port and it operated the same way, except it was lying down on the desk instead of standing up in the dock. If it weren't so expensive I'd give it more stars.Another issue I had with the iPod -- and I recognize this is MY fault, not Apple's -- if you are one of those people who, like myself, become overjoyed by the arrival of a new product and immediately tear into it without stopping to read the directions, BEWARE! I was unaware it comes with two different dock covers for the 20gig and the 40gig iPod, and inevitably in my excitement I connected the wrong cover. It is not designed to unattach! If my handy Boy Scout fiance hadn't been around to detatch it for me (with difficulty), I'd still have the wrong cover connected and I probably wouldn't even be using it. Of course, that's my fault entirely for being overeager. Just be warned! :o)"
3,What do you expect from a fake book?,"A transcription of Bird's solos. Be fair you are not going to learn jazz by playing the lead lines of a Herbie Hancock song from a fake book. This collection does its job, it gives you a start on learning the melody of many modern jazz standards. From there you must learn how to swing on your own."
4,Easy and Portable,"This fake book really is very nice. It's small, which means it fits in backpacks, instrument cases, or whatever, and it is very easy to read when being used. It also has a pretty nice selection of music. Of course, it's not going to have everything everyone wants, but what fakebook does?"
2,Make sure to look at the cover.,"I ordered this book thinking I was getting the Bb edition, but it is really the C-edition. And because it is not stated under the return policy as ""wrong item shipped"" I will be charged for the shipping to return it. Make sure to look at the cover page of any book before buying it because it will not always tell you in the information section of the item."
2,Only 3 months,"These are very cute shoes, and we've been happy with them until this morning I noticed that there is a hole in the toe. My daughter often insists on her cowgirl boots, sparkle shoes, brown boots, ...needless to say, these aren't her every day shoes, so I was surprised to see the failure so soon. I'm holding my opinion on the KSwiss response to my problem. I called this morning and they said that I could send them back, they would inspect them, and if they thought it was a manufacturing defect, then they would send a new pair. They said the process would take about 3 weeks. I suppose I'm most dissapointed because I thought I was paying for a quality shoe."
2,Book is ok but could have been a lot better,"I like the idea behind this book - the working relationship of McCartney and Lennon would be interesting if it was done well. The many errors in the book and the author's very obvious hatred of McCartney and adoration of Lennon tend to destroy any attempt at objectivity. An example - page 115 - John & Yoko ""made love""; page 126 - Paul & Linda ""shack up"". Things John said are the truth - thing Paul said are lies or attempts to make himself look good. I also find the author's put-downs of Beatles merchandising pretty funny - he seems to have quite a bit of Beatles merchandise (books) himself. It's a shame. This could have been a good book."
5,A Must Have for Parents,"This book should be be considered ""must read"" materials for parents with children attending school. The first 3 parts of the book addresses the terror attack itself and what the terrorists hoped to achieve. The last part talks about teaching your child to survive. In these days and times, children are ""locked down"" in a school when something happens. If I were a terrorists or just a VT or Columbine nutcase I would thank you for teaching your child to sit and wait for me. Please read this book and help keep your children alive. Even if you only read part 4 of the book, it will be worth it."
2,MILADY'S STANDARD HAIR COLORING MANUEL AND ACTIVITIES BOOK: A LEVEL SYSTEM APPROACH,"Not what I thought it would be. The book emphasizes the activities more than the instruction. There are some good things in the book overall as far as types of haircoloring procedures. Overall, I wish I had not ordered the book and kept my $35.99"
5,A great jazz/funk album from a Jazz giant,"Personally, I love the funky side of the bop greats. People like Grant Green, Jimmy Smith, J.J. Johnson could make you cry with a beautiful heart-wrenching standard, but they could also make you dance with some of their funky originals. Cannonball falls into this category - he is no doubt, one of the greatest bop saxophonists, and if you love modern funky bands like Soulive, Karl Denson, or The New Mastersounds, then you're going to love this album."
3,Inside Straight -- I'll Fold,"""Inside Straight"" is a far cry from the classic jazz Cannonball made with the Miles Davis Sextet, or as a leader on ""Somethin' Else,"" ""Know What I Mean?"" and ""In San Francisco."" This album is more funk than jazz, and when it does attempt the latter it is a foray into the then new electric variety pioneered by his former boss. Unfortunately, Adderley's efforts here come up far short of Miles' ""Bitches Brew"" and early 70s works. The funk songs, the title track and ""Snakin' The Grass"" are also mediocre, sounding like a poor man's cross between ""Headhunters"" and early Kool & the Gang. DJs looking for good samples will love this -- the title track even has a pre-Fat Boys human-beatbox part (!) -- but jazz fans should stick with the late 50s/early 60s material."
2,Avoid,"First off amazon says this movie is from 1992 but it's actually a recent movie.To tell you the truth I cant even tell you the plot because it was to nonsensical for me to follow. Now considering this is a Kung Fu movie the plot doesn't really matter if the fight scenes are awesome but unfortunately they are below average and few and far between. It's not so much that the scenes are poorly choreagraghed as the over directing, IE zooming in and out and going fast the slow then fast again. But what was really annoying was the animated blood that would splatter across the screen during fight scenes. So overall avoid this and get one of the other 100s of Kung Fu movies that are far more entertaining."
2,Not a good movie,"This movie was not very good. There were a few fight scenes but they were not really that good. The characters were not well developed and story was very weak. The best fight scene involved a character that was only seen twice but he was clearly the best fighter in the movie. I am used to watching the old school Kung Fu movies so I did not expect a ""Gone With the Wind"" type story line but this one was terrible. When the movie ended, it was unexpected because nothing had been resolved. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Garbage,"I expected a little...more. This is no more than a mere manual. Only a few pages. Very disappointed. I think I purchased it very cheaply, so I suppose I got what I paid for. I have purchased all Omaha high-low books I can find for a few years and this was, by far, the most pathetic."
5,Easily the best exposure book ever published,"This beautifully illustrated book has the best ""how to"" for surgery of the spine of any Atlas. The authors have obviously ""been there"" quite a bit, and illustrate all the trips and traps one might encounter. The anterior approach section is hard, if not impossible to beat."
3,Advice from a pro,The book is filled with advice from a seasoned global salesman. It is not academic and not a science treaty. It is filled with pieces of wisdom scattered around the whole book. It is fun and makes you think. Take it with you in the airplane!
1,Are you sure that Michael Moore didn't direct this film?,"I suppose that, with a title like ""Zombies of Mass Destruction,"" I should have expected a film filled with liberal propaganda, but this was just ridiculous. Basically, the preacher was portrayed as a nut, the conservative mayor was vilified, the ""patriotic"" family are idiots . . . you get the picture. These people are never given any redeeming qualities at all. If Michael Moore were to stop pretending to make ""documentaries"" and try his hand at non-pretend fiction, then this would probably be something that he would do."
2,We deserve better.,"Lotsa errors, omissions and inaccuracies. There's about as much chance of finding some of the Misfits singles for the prices listed in this guide as there is for the Boulder police to ever solve the Jon Bennet Ramsey murder."
2,Seems to be WEAK,"I don't understand where they get the figure 345 ft-lbs from. It seems very weak. I had bought mine to undo a crankshaft bolt (200 ft-lbs), but it failed.So I kept the thing to take off car lug nuts, but it truly struggles with them, and they're only torqued to 80 lbs-ft. I'm talking about lbs-ft and ft-lbs here... is that the problem? Maybe something torqued to 80 lbs-ft is the equivalent of 345 ft-lbs??? I don't think so!"
2,this thing is weak!,it is definitely NOT 350 torque as Dewalt clamins!!! i tried taking off the bolts off my wheels and this thing can't even get it loose. i returned it.
2,Disappointed,"opened box ~ looked great used about wk and stitching became unraveled from the outside seam - were the materials met, looking close inside,stitching all loops ,not attached - just gotten worstHave item now - no box - no tags and used?? if i send it back now, wont get a full refund? DISAPPOINTED!!!Got these same slippers for my husband last year - and lasted - otherwise they are really nice slippers"
2,lining came out immediately,"I bought these as a Christmas present and was really upset when the lining came out in chunks the very first time my boyfriend wore them.though the slippers look nice, and at first felt nice, since the lining is now gone they are not comfortable or warm anymore.this was our second and last pair of Tamarac slippers."
5,Comfortable and Warm!,Great slippers! Fuzzy interior keeps your feet warm and a durable rubber bottom protects on those quick runs down the driveway to get the paper.I really like my pair.
4,Terrific!,"I got these for my fiance to replace a poorer choice I had made as a Xmas present. While he's only had them for a month (so I can't comment on long term durability) he absolutely loves them! He often forgets to take them off for short trips to the grocery store, etc, and he keeps mentioning how supportive and comfortable they are. He has pretty bad back problems so it is really something that he finds them so comfortable. Good purchase!"
3,They'd Be Comfortable If They Fit,"I ordered these when they were a Lightning Deal. Was in the market for some new slippers and after reading most of the positive reviews, I decided to try them out. Two days later they arrived and I couldn't wait to try them on. I wear a size 10 always. Never a 9.5 and never a 10.5. These slippers were way too small. I called to place a return and was hoping to exchange them for a larger size to try. For whatever reason, the good folks at Amazon never made the offer. They were nice enough to pick up the tab for the return postage. I guess I'll never know how they really feel."
4,Not bad,"These slippers are just fine. good for everywhere, not just in the house. Keeps my feet warm and very soft inside. As for these Vegans getting upset about the use of leather....WA-WA. Just wish they made them out of Polar bear fur, now that's warmth :)"
2,Hair pulling band...,I really like the looks of this watch and it had a good weight. I like my watch bands to be loose enough that they can slide a bit. Unfortunately this band is designed with small sharp hair pulling connections. After only a few hours of wear there was noticeably less hair and it pulled as many as it cut making the whole experience disappointing. Since I live overseas I didn't return it but gave it to a friend with less hair on his arm. I would not recommend this watch to anyone with hair on their arms.
5,Laguna Max Flo 600 Pump,We needed a small pump to circulate water in our pond. Works great and is a excellent price.
4,Han Solo,This set of books deals with the story of Han Solo before Star Wars: A New Hope. It is a must have for any Han Solo fan.
3,Someone didn't do their research,"The same flaws I found in the previous book still apply to this one: chapters too long, story too boring(although it was better than the 1st one.)If A.C. didn't know enough about Boba Fett, she should've left him out. We know he didn't make up his own name. Also, Han feared Fett. We know this from the movies alone but A.C. didn't give us any explanation or reason why besides Fett was a fearsome bounty hunter. We knew that already. From Han's reaction in the movies, I figured Fett had done something personal to him.The only bright spots in the book were the interaction with the Hutts. I scanned the final book & I'm skipping it. It didn't look good either(The ending made no sense)."
4,it was a preview of early han solo,Hutt Gambitt adds more background to Han Solo then I never knew about. No wonder Boba Fett had a score to settle with Solo! It seems that much of the background of the characters and the situations like Lando and that big sabacc game all come into place here. It was fun to read even though I know how most of teh situations turn out. the one thing that I noticed in every star Wars novel is that they dwell on always repeating what we already know!
5,Great History of Han Solo,"In Cripin's second volume of the Han Solo Trilogy, it has Solo, recently booted from the Imperial Navy, teaming up with Chewbacca for a life of smuggling. Like the first volume of this series, Crispin has got Solo's personality and traits nailed perfectly. It's nice to have skilled writer working in the Star Wars universe.Lots of action in this one, including the battle between the smugglers and the Imperial forces. Also a lot of intrigue and political moves by the criminal Hutts that run most illegal operations in the Outer Rim worlds. Nice to see Jabba when he was young.Overall, a great Star Wars novel, and I look forward to reading the third in the series."
3,"Good, Honest story","A little rough around the edges, but it means well. The main character goes through peaks and valleys of life before he lands a friendship with a fellow female employee. Once this occurs, the story becomes interesting. From there he must fight his back stabbing friends, manipulative employees, and ghosts from his past. As this happens, the authour's wity dialogue and honest approach makes it seem like this could happen to anybody.There are plenty of characters for readers to relate to, and in the end they come together. Good thing is, the book makes sense. Any questions that were left hanging one hundred pages in, are answered by the close. I was impressed, but not thoroughly. It certainly needs some narrative work and editing touch-ups, but once that clears, you have a good-hearted story.Recommend it for anybody in their early twenties, or wanting to reflect on their early adulthood."
2,Too much work compared to other products on the market,"I too dont understand how people give this junk such a high review. Yes, it does shine well, it lasts fine, and it is very slick once on. The beading? It beads like crazy. The problem is that trying to buff this stuff off is like if you tried to buff a globb of crisco off of your car. You can do it, but it takes way to long. Granted some of the trouble is because my car is black. It doesnt ever dry. Some people will tell you they got it to dry, but only partially. Unless you buff it for HOURS, it leaves obvious streaks."
1,Bad results,"This wax does produce a good shine, as long as you stand close to the car. If you move away several feet, the car looks like it has a thin film of oil on the surface. No amount of buffing helps. I tried it on two cars with the same results. I won't be using this again."
1,Worst Polish I've Ever Used,I think I must have got a bad batch because this polish is highly rated. It never dried to a haze for me. The first time i used it I thought I hadn't shaken the bottle enough. The second time I shook the bottle - seven days later it still hasn't dried enough to buff off. I'm not sure if its the product or whether Amazon are selling an inferior conterfeit.
5,Very good wax.,"At step higher then Meguiar's Gold wax that I have been using for years. Looks better, lasts longer, good stuff overall."
3,Slightly Wicked,This was the last book of the Slightly series and it was not in very good condition. I was disappointed and hated that one of the pages was even missing. I did receive it in a timely manner. :(
3,Not first rate Balogh,"Mary Balogh is one of the best Regency authors out there and I've enjoyed most of her books but this isn't up to her usual high standards. The story is predictable. The hero and heroine are ""slightly"" drawn (excuse the pun!)and there's scant romantic tension or sensuality (compared to the best Balogh.)I agree with those reviewers who feel the hero is shallow and, yes, the heroine does seem to be right out of central casting. These aren't usual flaws in Balogh's work so the book was disappointing to me. However, even second rate Balogh is better than most of the Regency authors writing today so I'll still give the book 3 stars. But I'll be anxiously awaiting her next work!"
1,Um.....HELLO???,"Really? 47 videos?? But, yet, what?? No room for one of her best?? 'Bad Girl'...It was a cinematic feast from David Fincher and it couldn't be included??? I can 'almost' understand not including Dress You Up as it was a live video from a full concert, but to not include Bad Girl after making sure that 47 others made the cut is just idiotic...Who put this list together? A survey???"
3,Under my expectations.,"I'm a fan of Madonna and expected a better quality of the videos in this colection, the audio is great though, there's also some important vids missing.The best thing is the product arrived before I expected."
1,"hands up !, this is a robery","well, I read some of the bad reviews from the europeans since this article was released earlier in that continent, but I never tought they were that right, this is a trap just to get our money, I got the chance to compare this set with a pirate copy and there is no difference at all between the two of them, exact same video (mis)quality, exact same forced 5.1 stereo sound, I've made this comparisson with a blu-ray player connected to a SONY bravia 1080p via HDMI cable. I'm writting from Costa Rica and this is not the right way to fight piracy in Latin America, what a shame !"
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"From the ""instructor"" to the background ""dancers"" to the music- this DVD is an unprofessional effort."
5,Perfect Fit,Construction seems top notch. It was a direct fit replacement for the OEM in my Dodge Durango. Installation was a breeze. Vehicle was giving a code for the downstream O2 sensor and this corrected the problem.
3,"minimal case, but effective","I'd hoped this case was a translucent smoky color, but it is pretty much opaque. You cannot read the printed letters or numbers on the keys at all. There is a subtle crease between keys so you can (barely) tell where they are. Eventually I got used to it. The case fits well on my Motorola L6 phone, and offers good protection. I also use a transparent screen cover.Note that the L6 has only one side volume button- if your phone has two volume buttons, you may have the L7 which looks similar, but is not the same. This case would fit overall on the L7 phone, but the buttons would not match the cutouts. I found this out, because the first case I got (elsewhere) advertised as ""L6/L7"" turned out to be designed particularly for the L7 model."
5,Great Product,"The Cellex-C Sea Silk Oil-Free Moisturizer has been one of the few facial skin care products I've been able to use with my rosacea. It's light and gentle on the skin. I've been using it, with fewer breakouts. A great product!"
5,A common hope,"This book by Brian Daley is a wonderful resource for those who want to ascertain whether the hope by which Christians live in the present is the same hope as that by which Christians after New Testament times lived and for which many died. The book is a goldmine of information and insight; it is beautifully written and helpfully structured. The notes are a splendid tool for further research, as is the excellent bibliography. Daley concludes that there is an 'eschatological consensus', though it is expressed in very varied forms. This is the work of a first-rate scholar and an elegant writer."
4,Charlie Vernon is Loud,"The title of the review says it all. Now, I know I'm not telling you anything about the rest of the recording. Tough. I laugh at your misfortune. Just know this: If you do not know what ""loud bass trombone playing"" is before you hear this recording, you will after it. It's almost legendary. It could kill you. Oh yeah, the other 70 odd players in the orchestra are good too."
4,A Good Book with a Few Flaws.,"A very informative book with many facts on US railroads during WWII. The only thing I didn't like about this book is that most of the pictures used in the book were not from the WWII era. Photography of railroads during WWII was not allowed, which made pictures of trains during that time scarce, but there are still many quality photographs taken during that era that could have been used. The captions describing the photos were vague and inaccurate and became distracting. This book would have been good without the pictures at all."
2,Did not like smell,"I don't want to give this product too low of a review, because it did clean my pets fur well and was not irritating to his skin or eyes. We did not like however the baby powder smell (which seems to be the scent for most puppy shampoo)... but the smell did not last once his fur dried. For the next two days our puppy smelled like a wet dog. This part was disappointing to us"
4,Review of Tall Ships Book,"The book is full of wonderful photos and detailed descriptions of each of the ships in the book. The paperpack makes a nice companion guide for any OpSail 2000 enthusiast. It is portable, yet nice enough to keep on the coffee table."
4,"Not the best, not the worst","I've been listening to this new CD of theirs for a little while now, and it's allright. It wasn't what I thought it'd be, but after listening to it a few times, some of the songs became catchier. My favorites are Pain, Drugs or Me, Polaris, and Night Drive. I have their last CD, Bleed American, and the songs were really catchy and more upbeat. This CD is definitely mellow, but not altogether displeasing. I'd recommend it if you don't have high expectations of what this CD should sound like. It is actually quite good."
4,"Different, in a good way.","This album contrasts everything that I have seen from Jimmy Eat World thus far. They no longer repeat the same lyrics over and over again, but they've also lost the amazing instrumental highs and lows that they are loved for. I for one have never been a big fan of their faster, more poppy songs, and I think that the only songs that stand out in this album are the slower, more heartfelt ones (""Kill"", ""Polaris"", ""23""), just as my favorite in ""Bleed American"" was ""My Sunset"" and my favorites in ""Clarity"" included ""Table For Glasses"", ""Ten"", and ""Just Watch the Fireworks"".This group has definitely changed. But from the numerous new releases that have hit the stores recently by popular bands, I can see that maturity and change seems to be the new wave. I dont entirely approve of it, but Jimmy Eat World is by far the best band this year to go through the ""maturity"" thing and come out still sounding good."
5,Better Than Most,"Anyone who gives this cd under a 5 star rating is out of their rocker. This cd is very good and well written. (1)Futures is a great song to open up the cd. (4) Kill well its just great. (10) Night Drive is one of my favorite songs on the whole cd, starting out kinda mellow but pickin up pace as the song progresses. Another job well done Jimmy."
3,"Not exactly experimental, but satisfying","After hearing J.E.W.'s 1998 release, Clarity, I doubted that the band could make as coherent a statement since then. Unfortunately, they have yet to put forth as experiemental an effort. Coincidentally, that album was the ""uncommercial"" straw that broke the camel's back, getting them out of their contract with Capitol.The new one opens with a bang - the election-year track ""Futures"" - but aside from the title track and ""Work,"" very few sounds resound with as much punch or jolt as the band's work on Clarity or Static Prevails. The production is more mainstream than ever, but a group with such a wide mainstream following could have used this album to push their fans in a different direction, a la Radiohead or Coldplay. Instead, we're getting totally compentent emo-by-numbers, which is what it is: 3-star makeout music. I'm still hopeful for the next one."
3,Sturdy but not durable,"I have had this stand for about a year, and had the same issue with the flaps on the music table not folding easily. Over the last two weeks, plastic pieces have been falling off the hinges and today one of the flaps came off all the way. Great look for the price but wish it didn't break!"
1,Not a valid Seller,I contacted enzymedica about purchasing from this company and I was advised not to. I was told that enzymedica does not sell to this company and not to purchase from them since they are not purchasing the products direct fom enzumedica who knows were they are coming from. Just an FYI for anyone interested in purchasing from this company.
4,"Plays just like the original, but sometimes crashed","If you have a nice gamepad, this plays just like the arcade. It's easy to hit the combos and there's lots of settings to play with.The only problem I have is that is occasionally crashed on my PC. However, it's usually only does it when I exit it. Not sure what the problem is, but I love the game enough to live with it."
5,"Works perfectly, minimal hassle installing it.","I've been monitoring it's performance for more than a month. The radiator works perfectly. I have an older engine, and the previous radiator I've installed had some unnecessary issues (from installation to about a month after installing).I've had very little hassles installing this radiator. And once the engine was operational, the radiator showed it's true colors by performing exactly as advertised."
5,Replaces the missing minerals from my RO unit,I have used it a few times a month when doing 50% water changes using R O water in order to make sure the correct minerals are present in the tanks
5,A great success,"My daughter received My Size Barbie for her 3rd birthday. She absolutely loves her. She talks to her and loves to make her dance. She has a wonderful imagination. The only thing that I do not like is the tube top falls off really easy. So, I have to remind my daughter to make sure Barbie's top stays up. Other then that Barbie was a major success."
3,Both Good and Bad,"There were times in teh book that I really wanted the girl to get a back bone and smack the guy for being to rude, but that's simmiler in a lot of books.The story wasn't exactly unique, but it was a really fun read. If you are looking for a book that will take your breath away, you might want to look else were. But if you want something fun and light hearted, this is a good book."
3,Precious and Predictable,"I used to love these books, but the latest one is disappointing.Okay, maybe I'm bitter because I spent 3 hours filling in the survey and only got a fragment of a sentence in the book. In combining numerous quotations of one or two words with slick puns - ""Naan-partisan"" for lovers of Ajanta, an Indian restaurant in Berkeley, for example - the Zagats have created tight, clever, but ultimately not very useful capsules. These sound bites come off as precious, and fail to convey the best dishes, let alone the ""soul"" of the place.If I were a frequent traveler looking for ""safe"" places that prove popular with the herd, I'd download Zagat into my Palm. But if I wanted to know the real scoop, the best and the most suited to my tastes...."
2,Not too helpful,"At first I thought this would be a helpful book, but if you have questions about specific tasks you would like to perform, it is useless. I would not buy this book again."
3,Too Technical,"A very detailed book on the Planet Venus, however, it reads like an algebra text book. You can read a chapter and still not know what you read. I was dissapointed that all the photographs were in black and white. If you work for NASA, this is the book for you, otherwise I would recomend somthing a little less technical"
3,A Solid Effort!,"There aren't too many executives out there who would want to give up valuable time reading a book about getting in touch with the universal energy flow. But if you're willing to navigate the chakra points of Intuition, you just might pick up some hands-on exercises that can help you relax, manage stress and think creatively. These are hard skills that are fast becoming critical requirements in the new, dynamic economy, and in order to develop them, you might have to look in some new places for help. That's not to say that many professionals won't be left rolling their eyes at some of the more alternative of the many alternative notions advanced in this book. Nevertheless, we [...] recommend Intuition to harried executives looking for some advice on keeping it together in a demanding and fast-changing world."
2,Where's the Thin White Duke?,"I bought this CD because I had heard the Thin White Duke remix and thought it was awesome. Sadly, this is not the TWD remix. I guess Mirwais did this mix, and quite frankly, it sucks. Yes, I might be a little disappointed because I was expecting something else, but Mirwais doesn't venture too far from the Stone's original. Sometimes the sample looping seems a little sloppy on the ends, and the noise gets in the way of Craig Wedren's better vocal work. The second track, Involution, is a decent but forgettable downtempo track."
2,doesn't glow in the dark,I received the dice and I turned off the lights. One piece was glowing a little bit and the other one was completely dim.
2,Not erotic!,"I came home all excited to try them with my boyfriend , we turned the lights off so they could ""glow"" . . they glowed very little and the words were unreadable. We decided to turn the lights on so we could be able to read them and realized the words were already peeling off. They are not engraved!! Highly disappointed."
3,Wtf,The cd is in perfect shape but for some reason it only plays the soundtrack instead of playing the actual game. I don't get it.
4,"Great PostBop Exotica, An Early Showcase For Wynton Marsalis","Chico Freeman really had it all together in 1981, using his post-Coltrane sensibilities with a taste of North African exotica. He also has this kid playing trumpet who is just a monster...Bobby Hutcherson on vibes and Cecil McBee on bass are exceptional. Check out the cut ""Crossing The Sudan"" for a mix of African atmospherics and spooky work on bass clarinet by Freeman."
4,Saint-Saens: REQUIEM a pleasant surpirse,"This was a previously unknown work to me but it turned out to be a very preasant surprise. The quality of the recording is very good with well balanced music/vocal sections. The vocals were crisp and clear while the music supported the vocal line. A welcome addition to my collection of sacred music & rrequiems.The service from Amazon was, as usual, quick and easy."
2,"well researched, but skip it","while wilson's psychological insights into the minds of murderers intrigued me, many of his stretches into the human psyche fall flat (like most of 'Rise of Sex Crime' chapter). his tone of voice--especially concerning Jack the Ripper-- screams self-absorption. basic editing errors also detract from the reading. this book, however, was well-researched and the first couple of chapters are gems."
3,Not Easy To Use,"My Son was so excited to receive this toy, but the whole draw to the product was using the 'Cards' like the Rangers do. He has trouble getting them in and out if the plastic storage slots, and they were bent the 1st day. If the cards were made built into the plastic & were removeable from the gun it would be more durable. Also, he has trouble firing the projectiles. If it worked by pulling the trigger it would be a lot easier than the 'pull back' method it is designed with."
5,Garage Door Remote Replacement,"When your remote quits, this product replaces it at minimal cost. It is easy to install and works as advertised. Very pleased with this purchase."
1,Junk Junk Junk,"Seemed easy enough, installed it in less than 10 minutes. It only works when you are right on top of the antenna (1 inch away) and even then, it only works about 1 out of 10 tries. I tried changing the frequency about 10 times, each time with the same junkie results. You get what you pay for!"
4,Super easy and does the job!,"I bought this to replace a broken remote that couldn't be replaced any longer due to the age of the garage door opener. Installing it was extremely simple; took maybe 15-20 minutes. I wired the receiver directly to the garage door opener since there was an electrical outlet nearby for the garage door opener itself. I just wired it to the same terminals as the wired button switch that was on the wall. The range is fine. Using the remote will open the garage door as you're turning into the driveway, around 50-60 feet away. Not bad at all. I've only had it for a short time so we'll have to wait and see how long it lasts. But, so far so good! An easier, more standard battery replacement would have gotten it five stars."
2,Unreliable,"We used this to control the garage door. Either the receiver is not responsive or the remote itself is too weak. Either way, I often had resort to getting out of the car and walking right up to the garage door for the remote to work.It probably works 85% of the time. I think a remote control should be closer to 100%."
3,LITTLE NICE TRY!,"When you read the story about this movie,you must think as horror-fan,its a thing between ""SAW"" &""HOSTEL"".Luckily you're wrong!Its seemed so in the first part and twisted to a nice surprise.Thanks to actors like Steven Webber & Kelly Hu this movie wasn't totally bad!Its just a little horror-movie,not a great one.Think about it when you wanna buy it."
4,Tense with a Twist..,"I wasn't expecting too much with this movie but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered Farmhouse from Amazon during a horror movie drought. All I knew about the movie was that Kelly Hu was in it. That peaked my interest because she is smoking..Anyway, the movie involves the usual stranded bickering motorists who take refuge with a hospitable if somewhat strange couple in a remote farmhouse. The story takes some tense and graphically violent turns throughout the next hour or so but veers away from its SAW and HOSTEL underpannings and ends with an unexpected and supernatural climax. All in all a nice little horror movie and a welcome addition to my collection of the macabre."
3,Some people really can rationalize anything...,"The makers of this film want you to think this is a deep movie aboout Judgment or a retelling of Dante's Inferno. It's really an excuse to use a cheese grater on someone's knee.Of all the horror movies I have ever seen, and there have been quite a few, I've never seen a bigger coward than the husband in this movie. I actually felt like I was watching 3 different films. The first part could have been interesting, but then it got bad and then at the end it got really bad to the point of being laughable, although it does tie up some loose ends and help this whole mess make more sense.All of the actors surprisingly (given the crappy material), give great performances, especially the one who plays Scarlett. She's amazing."
3,needs more velcro,First I will say I really like these. The design is great and an old standard and the price is good. The issue is the metal button on the chin strap. Not the best design. Pops off mid activity and then the whole point of the headgear is lost....Does not happen all the time but enough to make you frustrated...
2,Has a short life!,"I only paid $10 for this software...and if I had paid more, I would not be happy. My daughter is a horse-lover and pretty good on the computer. She is 6 and played this for about two hours total and has discovered everything there is to do and I don't think she'll play with it again. You can change the flowers and banners on the arena and the horses, ride them in a show, and that's about it. Also, it does not seem to save your previous rides, so you have to start all over again each time you start the program. I would not recommend this software, except for a very young person."
3,My Puppy Book by Sondra Boynton,This book didn't work when I gave it for a Christmas gift. It doesn't bark like it is supposed to. The book itself is adorable.
5,great purchase,"I was very pleased when I received these. They are high quality, bigger then I expected and looks great! For the price, this is a great value."
1,Challenging yet Worthless,"OK, so most of you will disagree with me and consequently rate my review as ""not helpful"". I love Eastern spirituality, from ""Autobiography of a Yogi"" to Ouspensky, Castenada, Ram Dass, Gangaji, Richard Moss, Paul Lowe....the list can go on and on. But this book - oy! The neologisms were lame, the phlilosophy arcanely insane, the points pointless, the meaning meaningless, the imagery opaque, and the challenge - staying awake, and I don't mean metaphorically, I mean snorically. As Robin might say, ""Wholey Hogwash, Batman""."
5,very pleased,My order was received before the estimated arrival time and I saved money because there were no shipping fees! Love Amazon for that!Thanks!
1,not good,These earphones didn't even last 6 months... very disappointed. I want them to use while I run and now only one ear works which is really annoying. Junk. I guess I'm gonna have to break down and buy directly from apple. At least I will have a warranty and someone to complain to.
3,Didn't Last as long as hoped,"I bought this ring 2 years ago. When I bought it I loved it! The gems still sparkle and it is still a very pretty ring despite the scratches the surface has developed. Unfortunately, a gem has fallen out and I have had to clean it twice because muck gets stuck on the inside where the gems are sitting. I am currently on the market for a new one but I will definitely keep this one near."
2,SO DISAPPOINTED,"In the picture shown here the ring looks big and clear with shiny diamonds, but in reality it looks like a fashion ring someone would by for $5.I ordered a size 6, which is small obviously. But the CZ, they were so small and u can bearly see them, and they dont sparkle like the picture shows.The metal is shiny, i like it. Some people say it looks cheap but that is their opinion.The delivery and packaging was excellent.It came in this cute red box and arrived in 1 week."
5,above expectations,"we got this ring for my wedding dec 9th since time and money was important. I figured it would turn my hand or look dull, but not at all. Its almost a new yr and it still looks great with my platinum engagement ring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Sucks,This thing sucks. Stupid thing just says something about the dongle not being plugged in in AFTER I installed what was on the disk and plugging it in.
5,Tim Hansel,"When you get as far down as Tim Hansel was, after his injury, there is only one thing to do. Keep the faith and keep dancin."
5,Great Book for those in Pain,"I read this book many years ago, and since that time have purchased it for friends who are in pain/chronic pain. They always love it. One comment I have consistently gotten,is that Tim Hansel understands/endures pain himself, so they know he relates to what they are going through. I gave this book to a friend recently, and it really encouraged her."
2,PLAYAHATAR,THEY COULD HAVE CAME WITH SOME CLUB BANGERS. THIS ALBUM IS GOOD SON IT JUST WAS A UNDERGROUND ALBUM AND SO MANY ARE OUT HERE THESE DAYZ U DONT KNOW WHO GONE MAKE IT. HEY YO SON FORGET THESE CATS AND PICK UP MY MAN JOE BUDDEN ALBUM THA NEW TALENT OUT OF THE EAST AND HE GONE SHOW THA SOUTH OR WHOEVER HOW ITS DONE. IM LOOKING FOR THA JUMP OFFS SO HOLLA AT ME WHENEVER
2,Disappointing,"Although the interviews presented on this book are interesting, I found the comments of the writer detracted from the book immensely. The author, without fail, will always take it upon himself to state how awful things would soon become under Stalin. It seems as if the author is deathly afraid of being viewed as a Stalinist, and as a result must take every opportunity to state otherwise. Ironically, the actual words of the interviewees provided a more realistic, and far more interesting window into the times. If the book consisted mostly of interviews, rather than the words of the author, intent on discrediting the Soviet state whenever possible, I feel it would be an incredibly interesting book. However this is not the case. The author is clearly not an academic, historian, or even anyone very familiar with the time. This leads the majority of his commentary to be oversimplified, and in some cases even incorrect. In short, an excellent idea was sullied by a poor execution"
3,Celestron Binoculars,They are fine. Dont work like I want. When you focus in on a distant item it only prints what you see in the distance it dont bring it up close and print the fine detail.
3,Great for Tennessee Fans,"I bought this for my daughter age 12 for the natural born Tennesse fan she is. Her father is the Georgia fan and the upbeat tempo and dance versions of the Tennesse state anthem is great for ""Driving them Georgia Fans CRAZY"" !!!!"
2,Showed Promise but Fizzled Quickly,"I'll give this an A for effort. It starts out as a compelling suspense but after forty minutes of going in a circle about ""the question"" it soon turns lame. The only thing that hooks you is finding out what's gonna happen in the end but it's not because the writing is great, just for curiosity's sake.The premise of the film was nothing unique and has been done better in other movies. The film was draggy in spots and the ending was disappointing. With such a buildup I expected a great climax.Unfortunately the ending just left me more confused and assured me I should've given up on the film after half an hour.Skip it. It's nothing new or interesting."
5,Pleased!!!,I was so very pleased to find Stash Vanilla Decaf Chai as I always search store shelves and can't find it again. Now I have enough for the year probably....but will enjoy every cup and may even share some!
2,Doesn't Taste Live Vanilla,"I cannot detect any vanilla flavor at all in this tea, instead it tastes like cloves."
5,Great tasting Tea,"This is a great tasting Tea that is unfortunately no longer on the store shelves in my area.It tastes sort of like a creamy hot cocoa. So it's a great replacement if, like me you're lactose intolerant. It also comes in regular I believe for those who need their caffeine fix :)Also of note is that each tea bag is individually sealed in a foil package so the last bag is as fresh as the first. I've seen a lot of tea companies switch to loose bags and they get old quickly after you open the box. These are always fresh."
3,Taste Okay,"I ordered way too many boxes of this tea. I ordered several boxes before trying this tea, I had to give some of them away. It is not as good as I thought it was. The key is to put more milk and a sweetener in it to improve the taste. It taste okay, but not good enough for me to order this product a second time."
4,Solo Workouts,"While fascinating to Evans fans and jazz piano devotees, this album would probably not be the best place to start when building your Bill Evans collection. That said, it is quite an intriguing outing, and one of only two solo albums Evans officially released in his career. Here we find him getting deeply engaged in cascading layers of harmony and rhythm as he fully explores the potential of each tune here. The most vigorous workout is given to, of all songs, ""People""... about 15 minutes of variation and modulation, building in complexity and then subsiding to tender balladry. ""Tour-de-force"" may be the best way to describe it, it also happens to be remarkably beautiful in a very original way."
5,Great addition to the series,"This book is a great addition to the Bedwyn Series, each book is very different and does not have the same plot as some series can lean toward. A great read!!"
2,Slightly A Soapbox,"Like another reviewer, I found her editorials misplaced. If the author wishes to opine, she should do so in a letter to the editor.I read romance novels for a bit of escapism. For reality (and cogent opinion), I'll stick to US News& World Report and the Washington Post."
5,For collectors only,"'Karma Police', track 6 of OK Computer, is an exceptionally well-crafted song. Combine that and two other great songs, including 'A Reminder' (one of the best B-side tunes available from Radiohead), and you have yourself a worthy collectible item.Take notice that I have used the phrase, 'worthy collectible item' instead of 'worthy purchase'. I say this to suggest that it is only worth buying if you are a dedicated Radiohead fan, looking to build a collection. However, a more 'worthy purchase' would be the ""No Surprises/Running Away From Demons EP"", as it includes the same two B-sides, plus three additional ones and one other OK Computer single."
4,Expensive But Useful,"I bought this as a textbook for a community college course in digital photography. It is a fairly well-written, beautifully illustrated introduction to the main concepts and techniques of digital imaging. It could be useful for either a beginner or intermediate digital shooter. Of course, photographic hardware changes so fast that the book is quickly outdated, but that's not too important. It is still a useful book that opens the door to various techniques and procedures, encouraging the reader to continue experimenting and learning. The book's main drawback is its ""textbook"" price, which will deter some people from acquiring it. Despite the gorgeous illustrations and usefulness of the instruction, it still seems overpriced to me."
3,Seemed very thin...to me. Nothing to attach with...,"Well, the material in the filter seems thicker here than there...overall, inconsistent and didn't look thick enough to trap dustin places... that concerned me. There were no velcro tapesincluded to attach these filters to the vents - good thing I boughtthis as a replacement for my old filters, I just used the velcroalready there from the old filters... but you've been warned - didnot come with attachment velcro tape stuff. This does help, butdoes not cure my dustmite allergy - however - any help is welcomed!"
5,Now and Then,"I was totaly involved in this book. The chapters as they changed from Now to Then were very interesting to say the least. The ""young love"" that Christopher lived through struck me at my very heart. The ending is a strange twist that as I read it I actually did hope for! The many feelings that Christopher experiences we as young gay males have all felt at some time. This was a book that I could not put down!"
3,Missing heavy-duty kit box but FAST shipping,This item was suppose to contain a heavy-duty kit box but instead came with a soft bag. I was going to buy one for about $40 less but I wanted the box which I didn't end up receiving anyway. Other then that the product looks fine I just need to get my husband to use it to make sure it is in working order. SUPER FAST Shipping. I ordered it late at night on 11/29/11 and received it on 12/1/11.
1,Book is now out of date !,"While when I first purchased the book it brought me many positive results, but stars move alot and now the book is very out of date, Dont waste your money wait for his next edition."
4,"Good, but...","Having read three other Heinlein novels, I found this one to be good, but quite dated, as has been mentioned below. (It was originally published in 1951.) Some of the dialogue is silly and unbelievable, and some of the references are obscure. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this fun, quick read that is very creepy in parts! (Probably more of a 3.5 stars though, but I'll round up because of my respect for the author!) It's also clear to see that modern sci-fi novels have Heinlein to thank for some of its content and direction. I recommend Tunnel in the Sky, The Door Into Summer and Double Star."
4,A GOOD SCI-FI READ,"I thought book was a good blend of classic sci-fi with action and even humorous characters. Many good plot twists and turns written in Heinlein's unique style. Even today, I get shivers thinking about them. Weak ending in my view, however, makes this a 4 star to me rather than a 5 star. Anyone who likes Sci-Fi must read this."
1,"Glitches beg,",Do not buy this if you are playing from a newer computer or laptop. it doesn't correspond with them. sO JUST WATCH OUT
3,Not as fun as previous titles,"I don't know if it's just me, but this game didn't seem as coherent as the previous titles, all of which I enjoyed thoroughly. I had much more trouble keeping track of the story and what I was supposed to be doing with this one. Plus, it was very buggy. When I played at Senior Detective level, my roommate never showed up after her fitting and I couldn't finish the game. It was not nearly as fun as I hoped it would be. I hope the next one is better."
3,Not as fun as most of the ND games,"My daughter and I love and anticipate all the Nancy Drew games, and this is by far our least favorite. The puzzles are really ridiculous or really easy. Nothing really seems to flow very well, it's all very choppy and separate from one another. We did enjoy the France backdrop though!"
2,Boooooorrrring!!!!,"I love the Nancy Drew games, but Danger by Design stinks! I hope this isn't a sign that the series is going downhill. After finishing Danger by Design (and being thoroughly bored by the tedious, annoying, pointless puzzles that have nothing to do with Paris and little to do with fashion) I replayed Secret of the Old Clock. Even though Clock wasn't my all-time favorite, it was soooooo much better than Danger by Design. Let's hope the next installment gets back on track!"
4,It's not THAT bad...,"Everyone doesn't like this game for some reason(someone even called it ""a lame French game""), but I disagree. The graphics are spectacular,the music is fitting,and it the plot is suspenseful. I suggest that you buy it, because it's worth the money!Plus,the ending is kinda funny.This game is not that bad,so buy it and see for yourself!"
3,no real difference is gas mileage or performance,"I have owned several k&n products on various cars and trucks. I was hoping for at least a slight increase in performance or mileage with this filter for my is300, it wasnt the case in this particular application. Save yourself the extra $40 if you buy it and thats what your looking for, on the bright side it is a lifetime filter so it will be the last one I buy for this car."
3,Woody Allen experiments,"Not his best writing. He has written much better plays, such as Don't Drink the Water, but his real forte is in screen writing."
3,Amongst lesser popular live recordings,"It basically goes without saying that any reasonably recorded live set from 'Trane is worth seeking out for the jazz-obsessed, but despite an extended P.C. (primarily through typically unengaging side-soloing) there is nothing from The Paris Concert fans wouldn't find in other, greater live recordings of which this artist has plenty. In fact, the brief disc feels surprisingly bare-bones, with no real incentive from the man himself to distinguish this admittedly great performance amongst numerous admittedly superb ones."
5,The Best Book that I have ever read . . .,I was intially a bit uneasy with AP English at first until I picked up this wonder book. Ever since I have been scoring 8-9's on all of my practice essays in class and I have been scoring consistently over 75% in the multiple choice section. You must by this book and I guarantee you that if you work with the book you will get at least a 4 on the real thing. With this book I look forward to a five in May.
5,Derby Hat,"Ordered hat and hat was as described, however hat was too big. Called customer service , wonderful people, they sent a smaller size and it arrived in three days. Amazing service ."
3,Decent,Book arrived sooner than USPS claimed. Reeked of smoke though. Had to air the book out for a few days due to the smell.
4,A Great Starter Book,"This book is so much superior to the 64-page starter books out there. It's full of information.I wish there was more ""step-by-step"" information. So far, I've found the best how-to information on the web."
5,Great tasting tea!,"I love all kinds of tea, especially Earl Grey, but for the basic, everyday tea, for hot tea and iced tea, I preferred Lipton. This PG Tips tea has changed my preference, and it has become my new favorite. I like the crisp, clean taste and I really like the fact that they don't put paper tags and string on the tea bags. I have used it for hot and iced tea, and it works beautifully. I also like the reach in box of loose tea bags; so easy to grab. I bought the box of 80, and I know I will order it again."
3,Bad track switchers,"While this is a very basic layout, you would assume a high level of quality from Lionel. Unfortunately, the track switches are very cheaply made out of plastic and only lasted two days w/ my kids... They are made of plastic and are quite fragile."
1,Boring !!,Not a very modern approach. Most of the ideas in this book would be appropriate for the 70's and 80's but not for today. The techniques used are all things any colorist should know coming out of beauty school.
2,Close to becoming irrelevant,"Unless you are using 35 mm film and flying a biplane for your aerial photography needs, don't buy the book. Go to the library instead. It's too expensive to take the space on my shelf."
5,It goes everywhere with me.,"Combine this with my Moleskine Calender and I've got the ultimate ""Get It Done"" combination. It's a great pencil that won't destroy your clothes or inflict you with puncture wounds. Yes the eraser leaves a bit to be desired, but what mechanical pencil eraser doesn't?Highly recommended and this is an excellent price."
3,Tastes like hot chocolate not like the candy,"Let me just start off by saying when I bought this I didn't know what I was expecting. I LOVE cadburys the candy bars and I drink chocolate milk but I had no idea if this would be anything like the candy bar.I drink nesquick chocolate milk on a daily basis with the powder, in comparison the Cadburys Chocolate powder really tastes like hot chocolate WHICH if you are in the mood for it'd be perfect with some marshmellows but it is nothing like the candy bar.I hope that helps :-)"
5,Best Hot Chocolate Ever,"As an anti-coffee person, I like to think of myself as a tea and hot chocolate connoisseur;) While living in England for 3 years (about 10 years ago) I discovered Cadbury's Drinking Chocolate and have never looked back. I brought home a case of it when we moved back to the states. I've ordered it online ever since. When I give it as a gift, it gets rave reviews and people beg me where to buy it. Make sure to make it with milk, not water like some of the American hot chocolate. It's also great with a touch of Bailey's. Enjoy!"
3,Made in China,The latest batch of these blades are now made in China. There is a defiant quality difference from when they used to be made in Germany.
2,Just Okay,These are definetly not worth the money. Buy a regular pair of wipers that cost half the price. THey worked great for the first two weeks then they started leaving streaks.
3,OK program,"These exercises are set up for the most frail. They can be done with canes and/or walkers as well as seated. Excellent instruction for those trying to regain basic strength and balance for walking and basic gait training. Good suggestions for balanced routine daily movements. They point out they are giving you a range of exercises to choose from. To be most effective, you need to choose the ones you need and spend a longer time on them. Good catalog of exercises."
5,Love it,"I have locked myself out of the truck several times and this receiver safe has saved me several times, worth it!"
5,Love it,Only took a couple of minutes to install. Fit my SUV hitch without problem. Holds my car key and fob (won't fit much more than that). Now I can paddleboard without worrying about losing my key in the ocean. Love it! Worth the money!!
4,Great Construction,"I purchased this safe after seeing it on DIY. After receiving it, I was quite impressed with it's solid and weatherproof construction. The only thing I'm not overly happy with is the fit of the cover. Although it hasn't fallen off (yet) it is a very loose fit that seems like only a matter of time before it falls off."
3,"great product, bad customer service","I ordered a hitch safe for my son after I'd used one for years and really liked the peace of mind it gave me knowing the spare key would be there when it was most needed. Not only for those back woods trips, but we've used it many times when one of us had the key headed off to work(me) and someone else (my wife) needed to move the truck. The reason I gave it three stars is because my son's truck is a toyota and reqires longer pins to use the safe. No one seemed to know a thing about this problem. Amazon refered me to their vendor who charged me an additional $10.00 to send out the correct size pins. After digging deeper on line I've seen that this problem wasn't unique at all. I hope this helps you, it cost me $10.00 to find out."
2,leap year,"The movie was not that great at all, It was nothing like I thought it would be like, the sex scene was very weak, something you can seeon cinemax at late night, the movies that I would recommend is 9 Song, and Sex stories, now these were great movies, it was moreto the point."
3,decent garage band,"This band was one of the main events at CBGB after the likes of Blondie, the Ramones and more commercially successful acts had moved on to bigger things, and the Dead Boys were rising as the main attraction at CBGB. They were a good live band, but a mediocre production hampered the quality of the album. Compared to the live performances this album was a little disappointing, but if you're a garage band junkie I'd recommend it."
1,Beware Kindle Owners..Big Problem with Format Here!,"Thank Goodness Amazon Customer Service is first-rate. I just easily got a credit for this book & the book TWICE DEAD in the same series. Both were removed from my Kindle & my archives.I purchased both books after reading the first book of the series on my Kindle and finding it a ""fun"" read. These two, however, formatted without any quotation marks, were no fun at all. I recommend you try a sample first to see if the formatting problem has been addressed before you purchase any of the books in this series."
3,Not a sure fix,"I purchased this book after reading the reviews and receiving a recommendation from my pediatrician. It is a nice story; however, it doesn't work for all children. My daughter will tell me that she doesn't want the sleep fairy to visit. When she wakes up in the night and we remind her that she has to be in her bed and asleep if she wants the sleep fairy to visit she tells us that the sleep fairy scares her. In addition, she has told us stories such as the sleep fairy hit her, the sleep fairy is mean, etc. We have also had trouble with her repeatedly checking under her pillow to see if the sleep fairy has come resulting in us leaving the sleep fairy gifts under mommy's pillow. Personally I would have to say that we have had as much success with this as we have had just reading Cinderella or Snow White to her."
1,Disappointing considering the Actors,"We kept waiting for something to happen in this movie and for it to become interesting. Although it took an effort to continue watching it, we didn't want to waste the $3.99 rental fee. So we kept waiting, and waiting. And Waiting. When the movie was over and we watched the credits roll, we realized it was never going to get interesting.After consideration, I still wonder what was the point, and why would anyone agree to fund a movie with this storyline. There are so many more worthy stories!"
4,"Non-linear, boring","(I have NOT seen this movie yet, but I can only speculate on the rating.) If there's no point to the story, then that's probably intentional. There no point to mentioning something that's 'boring!;' keep in mind there's if something's not obvious to someone's attention, then that something's not perceived well."
1,"""Left For Bed""","The marketing guys got me again with the box art. Drew me right in. Hot chicks in a bloody western with a touch of the occult? I'm there. Plus the director won the award for the Best Director at the Estepona Horror and Fantasy Film Festival. Where is Estepona anyway? I have know a guy named Estepona, maybe the festival was in his family room. Oh! I forgot the movie, well I struggled to make it through, but in the end I turned it off and went to bed. A totally incoherent plot, a director whose never heard of storyboarding, and cinematographer in love with his cool digital toys, freeze frames to the point where I thought the DVD locked up, herky jerky camera work, not much in the way of gore. Take ""Manos Hands of Fate"" and try to spruce it up with the visual elements of ""Natural Born Killers"" and place it in the $3 bin at Big Lots and you have a formula for excess."
3,Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture,The seller neglected to inform me that the book was an ex-library book with stamps throughout and a plastic cover taped down. The book was advertised as used - very good condition. As a collector this is very dissappointing.
5,"Amazing, amazing, amazing","I bought this book because I saw Levy on The Colbert Report and thought she was funny, smart and that her book sounded cool. I was NOT DISAPPOINTED. FCP is so thought-provoking and interesting...I am giving the book as gifts to everyone this holiday season, because I think it is a MUST-READ for men and women and because it's just damn good. Though I can see why other readers felt her view of today's raunch culture was depressing, I felt that her book was inspiring....inspiring me to stop being so complacent about issues within our culture and try to actually do something. I can't wait for Levy to write her next book."
3,Hmm.. ok,I ordered this and My First Learning Library (Box Set) for 22 month. The book looks and feel good but my son didn't show as much interest in this one as he did with My First Learning Library (Box Set). I also don't like the cut out pages in between. It is annoying and complicated for kids.
4,Fun books,"Easy way to teach your kids the colors, shapes, 1st words and numbers 1-10. Just wish the color book had orange in it."
2,Bad art,"I didn't like any of the art in the books. I didn't like how the pages are divided in half. The object is to find bottom page that matches the top page. It may be a good idea in theory, but pretty bad in real life. I just wanted some books to read to my 4-month-old. I just wanted a numbers book that went from 1 to 10 in order. The books are more like flash cards except instead of having a back and front, they have a top and bottom section. If you want flash cards, buy flash cards. If you want some books, buy something else."
3,The Royal Rumble 1999 was ok but not great.,The Royal Rumbel No chance in hell is olny good for the i ouit match up the ROYAL RUMBEL it slef was not that good it was ok but no where as good as other ROYAL RUMBELS i have not yet saw The ROYAL RUMBEL 1998 but i here its the best one yet so i would pick up the 1998 ROYAL RUMBEL and rent 1999 ROYAL RUMBEL for the i ouit match only.
4,"No Chance, No Chance in Hell!!","It was another successful PPV by the WWF. But if i were you, I would rent it instead of buying it because i just got through watching it. Save you cash for ST. Valentines Day Massacure."
3,One-match show,"Don't get me wrong. The 1999 Royal Rumble wasn't too bad. But despite the amazingly brutal and all-too real beating handed out to Mick Foley by The Rock in their I Quit match, the fact that the entire show was based around the actual Rumble itself annoyed me a bit, especially since after the initial excitement of Steve Austin finally getting his paws on Vince McMahon died down, the Rumble was actually a fairly tedious one, overflowing with mid-carders who we all knew had no hope of winning it anyway. However, it is worth buying for the I Quit match alone."
4,Quick and easy overview to owning an offshore bank !,"I found this book to be a fast-reading, informative overview to owning an offshore international bank. Its 12 chapters cover topics ranging from how these banks work, privacy issues, risks and tax-benefits, to asset protection, case histories and how and where to begin. I'm interested in finance, but do not currently have my own offshore bank. There's plenty of useful information in this volume, but reading it is just the beginning. Anyone venturing into this area of banking should certainly personally obtain the assistance of an ""expert"" in the field. If you're considering such a venture, reading this book is an appropriate start."
4,Obscure Cars from Cars,"My Wife is an Isetta fan, I took her to a micro car show and she fell in love with this silly car. In the end credits of Cars, they show a series of Pixar films remade using cars. Mike was cast as an Isetta, perfect, Sully the Monster truck is obvious and funny.For those who know"
3,Too Dense,"I'm an activist for social justice, and a fan of progressive whole cost economists like Herman Daly, David Ellerman, and Michel Aglietta. I found this work so dense and dry that it was extremely slow going and difficult to absorb. It is a macroeconomic work.It lacks any highly detailed discussions to convey greater clarity and supply a fuller perspective, something I look for in history since I am trying to connect it to microeconomics and the larger sociopolitical context and ultimately environmental and justice issues."
3,"Strange, but Fascinating","It's not quite Hong Kong bullet-ballet. It's not quite traditional revenge flick. It certainly wasn't what the description lead me to expect. Ok, so you know an ex-assassin returns to the business to avenge the deaths of his daughter's family. But he's no super-assassin. He needs help. And not just because it's one of him against who knows how many others. There's some neat spins to the genre here that make this different.It's highly stylized (especially a gunfight in a dump that's filmed with the pomp of a set-piece historical battle), very moody, and the way it weaves its themes together make this a sorta-kind anti-action film. Also, very bloody."
1,Waste of my time,"Started of strong, but fizzled into dumb movie. It was a waste of my time. Couldn't sit through to finish the movie."
2,No strategy and terrible tactics,I was willing to ignore my disbelief at the beginning when the hit men let the chef/father live before he hired them. I found the film enjoyable enough until late in the film when it combined the unconvincing Memento riff and the ludicrously suicidal shoot out in the dump. They had chosen to flee when they were outnumbered in a tenement where they actually had cover and multiple opportunities to ambush and withdraw but later the three of them take on dozens in the dump shoot out instead of retreating for another day on better ground. And they don't simply stand their ground in the open; they advance so they can be encircled. Ludicrous!
1,Horrible horrible horrible,"This book is terrible. I was leafing through it and looked at the caponata recipe--which includes ketchup. The author justifies this because ketchup has tomato, salt, and sugar in it. Whoa. Then, I tried making the bread (for some unknown reason). No salt. Egregious omission. And the ingredient list for the bread is incomplete--it doesn't include the water for the addition of the flour to the sponge. I only paid $16 for this book and it will cost me a lot more than that in time lost to return it, but I am going to.The flip side is that the author appears to have a lot of experience with Sicilian cuisine, and maybe she was trying to write a very accesible book (which would explain the ketchup); but I wish she would have done a book using authentic recipes rather than this one."
2,"Evident Bias, Lacks Substantiation","While Mr. Margolis' book provides interesting background on the conflicts in Central Asia, it is difficult to identify the demarcation between fact and fiction. The book has not a single footnote to identify sources or substantiate his claims. This makes it difficult to accept Mr. Margolis' more inflammatory allegations as anything more than gossip designed to validate his point of view. Combined with his evident bias, I would caution readers to approach this book with a fair degree of skepticism."
3,Interesting but problematic,"This book is well written and not a difficult read given the complex topic. The main suffering point is that Margolis is not a research Historian and the book is not written from the point of view of journalist. Margolis makes many good points, especially in concerns to potential future problems, but he really fails to deliver the kind of un-biased factual evidence to back some of his points. Margolis does know the area, people, and events but this is not enough for a book that is presenting History.If you are looking for current-event information or even a primer on this region, then this book isn't a bad read. I did enjoy the book, but felt it could have been better researched and developed."
1,A Disappointment,"I am disappointed to say that this book puts forward a far from accurate portrayal of the recent happennings in the Indian sub-continent. The author seems mired in his own personal views, than in facts. Anyone with slight knowledge or the inclination to do some research, would be able to see through the facade. There are better avenues of information available to those interested, than this publication."
1,Fact or Fiction,"I must agree with some of the other opinions. How much clout does the opinion of a person who is so 'in love' with one side have in a bi-lateral issue? The author's disregard to include any rebuttals or views from the other side makes this just as realistic as a Tom Clancy novel. Those who like to read fiction will find this book interesting, with a travel diary included for free. Others will can find more appropriate avenues of factual information, both in text and on the Internet. Try to get this book when it goes on sale for $1.99."
4,I boughtit to connect a TV to the phone line,It works well in one room connected to a TV and not in another room. Not sure why. This can save you $5/month per dish receiver when they work.
5,The imfamous Stiv Bators!,"We Have Come For Your Children is a full speed follow up to Young Loud And Snotty!These two discs should be sold together,for any person into the PUNK scene.The Dead Boys where at the head of the game, with Stiv Bators vocals and the greatband to back him up. I recommend If you can get a DVD of the Dead Boys, get it.You will not regret it, only if you could have scene them LIVE.Stiv Bators wasone great entertainer,with him cutting himself on stage. His career didn't endwith the demise of the Dead Boys. He had a great SOLO career also!"
1,Unable to get it to work - concerned about virus in driver,"Ordered this product to interface my Garmin etrex Vista GPS to my PC. The GPS cable has a serial connector. My PC does not. Loaded the cable driver sw per instructions. Configured the GPS per Garmin instructions. Tried all COM ports and could never get it to work. Tried using the Garmin Web Updater with the cable and got a Windows XP blue screen that did a core dump and stopped the PC. Had to turn off its power to reboot. When rebooting, I got a message saying there was a start-up program in system root trying to launch. Made me worry about a virus - but maybe I'm paranoid. I've uninstalled the sw and PC seems to be ok. I contacted Sabrent support but they've not provided any useful info. I'd return the converter to Amazon for credit, but the return shipping costs almost as much as the converter so I'm simply trashing it. Glad some other customers have had good luck using it - but I can't recommend it."
5,Works on Mac and Linux,"Works on Macbook Pro with ZTerm v1.1beta7 as tty.usbserial and Ubuntu Linux 8.10 Minicom 2.3 as ttyUSB0, both without loading the driver CD. So far I have just tried using it on Cisco router consoles."
3,Horlick's,It is a very mild flavored drink and a bit on the costly side. I do not think I would reorder it.
4,"Very nice, sturdy but small","Just got this from Target today as well as the side table. Beautiful pieces. I really love the look of the distressed chocolate wood. However, the coffee table is really small. If you're buying this on line, pay attention to the dimensions."
3,interesting mixture,i was excited to try this scrub however when i received it the mixture was all the oil at top and the grains at bottom. needless to say i have to shake it each time and i feel like there is too much oil in it. it does leave my skin soft and does scrub but is quite hard to get out properly from the jar. the consistency of the product inside needs to be updated.
5,LOVE THIS DRAMA!!!,This is one of My Favoriate Korean Drama's by Far!!!! :D This show is tottaly addicting and will have you laugh and cry with the cast!! The acting is superb and loveable! There is laughter and crying and all other emotions put in just at the right times! I HIHGLEY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY DRAMA WATCHER!! IF YOU WATCH K-DRAMA'S THEN THIS IS THE SHOW FOR YOU!!! *^_^*
5,Enjoyed watching this online; the DVD set is excellent,"Many of the Korean DVD sets I've purchased have suffered from wonky or incomplete subtitles, but this set is subtitled well.The story is sideways, and it may require a couple viewings to pick up on all the clues, but it's funny, sad, profound, and ends well. As for genre, it fits into the ""magical realism"" category, in which the fantastic exists comfortably alongside the real, and directly influences the story. Men and women alike will enjoy this series."
1,Absolutely pathetic,"This is unquestionably the worst production/presentation I have ever seen. It's content is 2 hours of visual bovine excrement. It's so bad that it's insulting. It's so bad that it makes every presentation by History Channel questionable. If anyone reading this knows anyone in upper or executive management please, PLEASE contact them immediately and implore that they remove this from their catalog and have it quietly destroyed. Or, to write off a total loss perhaps the discs can be sold in bulk quantity to shooting ranges as targets. Let's hope History Channel will collectively get their finger out of their nose and prevent TV viewers from embarrassment this bad ever again."
2,Meh.,"This is definitely an imperfect product. Weak magnetism with overly enthusiastic velcro means installation mistakes are likely. I wish there was a slicker solution to this problem! I rent an old duplex with forced air and the ducts are clearly filthy. Adding filters to the vents has helped, but I wish the solution was a little more elegant. DIY is not a bad way to go."
2,slow,Vaguely I remember a programme on film production that included a couple of surprisingly simple dictates in production.-films are approximately the same lentgh because that is only how long we will give our time to it. Then its time for Part 2 or we complain even if it was good.- it only has so long to get to the point. or its point.This is a window almost to a number of minutes.Its as though since the theme of this film is the nature of insidiousness - its ok to make the axis of getting to the point insidious too. Hence I kept fast forwarding to the action bits that only happened towards the end.It was a shame because when the protagonist did peer over the edge into his dark side it was chilling and realistic. But too late.
2,Was Great While it Worked,"I've been using this printer for about a year and a half. I didn't use it often, but it was handy when I did. HOWEVER after not using it for a month I tried using it this weekend and the paper feed motor had died."
2,"HP 3845 ""Paper Jam Master""","I've had this printer for about 2 years. It's fine unless you're printing on photo paper.I've been sitting here all morning trying to print several pages of photo paper and 9 out of every 10 pages that I try to print on, gets jammed.Then, you've gotta unplug the power to clear the print job from the queue.And after that, you've gotta remove the plastic piece in the BACK of the printer, to remove the paper.It's driving me CRAZY and if I owned a sledgehammer, I'd turn this printer into dust!Don't buy it, get something that at LEAST has the jammed paper remover on the front."
5,An excellent beginners book,Very easy to understand for the average application user like myself. Chapter outlines are clear and concise for the beginner. I recommend this for the average user of office applications but has never used Visio 2002 - like myself.
2,The best way to learn harmonic,This books talks alabout how to learn how to play the harmonica. It starts from the begining. Has a indepth conversation on style tecknequic and how to hold it. The choice of songs to practise the newly learned skills was suberb.
1,Very Disappointed,I'm a very skilled golf semi-pro who normally uses Titleist Pro V1x balls. I decided to switch to these for a round and the results were horrible. These balls traveled about 10 yards shorter off my driver with terrible feel. The spin on these balls is inferior as well.I would strongly not recommend purchasing these balls for tournament play.
1,Buyer Beware!!,"Patterns and projects? Give me a break! I think next year I'll write a book on how to build a rocking horse. If I use the format presented here, all I need to do is suggest that you buy some wood. I'll provide the measures and of you go. Good luck.Don't buy this book. Frankly these toys simply don't work as well as suggested. Perhaps the author was so caught up in getting the measurements right, that he forgot to give any instructions that would have made cutting all those articulating pieces worth the effort. Your money would be better spent on ""Fun to Make Wooden Toys and Games"" by Jeff and Jennie Loader. This book is filled with useful and excellent illustrations. What a gem."
1,Missing Red Snappers,"I was on a snorkeling live-aboard trip to Surin and Similan islands in Thailand. The ship had this book in both German and English.One evening we purchased a red snapper from local fishermen. The fish was then cooked and served for dinner. Next day I tried to find red snapper in either editions of the book and could not. Neither could anybody on board. We did find Mangrove snapper, but it was not red.Unless we ate the last red snapper in the Indian ocean (which I doubt), such omission is inexcusable."
4,Excellent gude for divers,"Comprehensive, well illustrated and enhanced by interesting anectdotes on the main dive areas in the region. Specific descriptions have good detail on appearence, distribution and habitat as well as distinguishing similar looking species where apropriate. The geographic detail with each picture is a nice idea."
1,This is a lousy excuse for a book!,"First of all this book is NOT geared toward the computer repair business as the Title on Amazon leads you to believe.Secondly, the author is VERY NEGATIVE. He seems to be trying to discourage as many people as possible from starting a computer business. Every page is another story how things can (and probably will) go wrong. I can understand warning people not to get too optimistic, but this guy goes over the line!Buy this book only if you want to get depressed and lose your excitement about starting a new business."
5,"Yes, yes, yes!","A very SOLID book with lots to say, Mosher has created a wonderful novel about a moment in time in a small town in Vermont. It exposes small town thinking and it's affects on a young teenage boy and his life from that point on. Lots of action, suspense, warm and crusty Vermont characters, baseball and apple pie for everyone. But the book has an important edge beneath the veneer of small town life. This could be about any town anywhere in America. It exposes the underside of people- the dark side- of prejudice and clannishness. An important book. One you won't forget easily."
3,New England Novel,"I gave this book three stars because I found it was a dramatic tail taking place in a small upstate Vermont town. However the first half of the book seemed to drag and was spent on unnecessary character development. This is definetly a good book, just do your self a favor and start reading it from the middle."
5,Great for the hard of hearing,"I got this for my brother-in-law who is a nursing home resident. He is very hard of hearing and it works just great. The light, indicating an incoming call, is an added benefit for him. I have tried other phones for him, but this is the best by far. A very quality item."
3,2 points of view,"If you are looking for advice, I would not recommend this book. If you are looking for satire, then go for this book!"
1,Title misleading,"This book's title is misleading. It is more the author's philosophy of life, over the course of life, than a guide to picking up or handling women. It fails at both tasks however. Plus it's not funny (at least that would have somewhat mitigated the time wasted reading the book)."
1,probably the worst book i have ever read.,"do not buy this, is was not funny or informative. I personally found it to be completely trivial, and the sense of humour mildly funny at the best of times. good luck to you if you thing you will achieve anything for yourself by reading this book - other than a violent beating from a lynch mob of feminazis, and a severe shortage of friends."
2,"This book is for fun, not really a guide of any sort...","Yeah, pretty much what I said. I bought this because the title was funny and being that I don't really take other people's feelings all that seriously in my dating trysts and such I figured I'd buy it. The writers pretty much just sat down and had fun writing a humorous account of the dating world the way they saw it. They base it primarily off of timelines of males, what they should be doing at those particular periods in their life and how to ""handle chicks"" during those intervals.As I said it's a fun read but don't buy this book if your dating life sucks or you're not that good with women. It won't help you. It's just something to pass time on a plane, on a vacation, or in the bathroom. Nothing more."
2,not what I expected...,I thought this book would be funnier but its pretty dumb I think they were serious about most of the stuff in here... not even comparable to maddox and tucker max's book.
1,book,not a really good book. wasnt very helpful. was basically a generallization. really wasnt filled with helpful content. ive found better information from david deAngelos online books and such.
2,"These books are fun, but useless","I've been distressed to read that most of the reviewers of this book want to be a pick up artist (PUA). They take this stuff seriously!My advice if you can't meet women, take a shower, join a gym, and get your teeth cleaned."
2,Faces of death,"I grew up watching faces of death and was very excited to see they had made a 30th anniversary edition, blu-ray at that. Once I started watching it I was disappointed. If you are interested in buying this atleast save alittle but of money and get the dvd version instead of blu-ray."
1,Get a life......... and stop being so creepy,"Listen up dude (I can't imagine anybody but a guy purchasing this)...when I first heard of this totally fake movie, I was a stupid and impressionable 18 year old and rented this for a dollar at my local video store. As I watched it, I said to myself, ""How am I staring at this stupidity for entertainment purposes, don't I have anything else better to do?!"" Now, you are contemplating buying this and having it your collection forever?! Would you want, like your boss, family or, a date, knwoing that you are into this?"
3,This is Carlisle Street renamed.,I neither loved or hated this book. It was entertaining. Not one I would keep on my shelf but I got into it and read it in a couple days. I would check out others by this author. That is what I thought I was doing when I purchased this book. I had already read it a week before under it's original title Carlisle Street. I was disappointed that not only had the title changed but also had some of the character names. Does anyone know why the name change. I don't see anywhere where this is stated or mentioned. It is confusing. Not a highly memorable story for my taste but It is worth the read.
3,A walk through the Rockies and the desert finding love,"Although I LOVE Desert Solitaire and most of Abbey's writings, (hated the Monkey Wrench Gang though), I finished this book in a few hours and was left desiring someone to communicate with me about it. Confused and frustrated at the premature ending, I remain uncertain how to review it.At times, I found his writing over descriptive and redundant and the romance a bit unbelievable, but I continued on hoping for the characters to develop and for the writings to say something. The unsettled feelings I remain with cause me to rate Black Sun only 3 1/2."
4,Abbey at his Abbey-ist,"I was pretty much fully aware of what I was getting into with this book and as many other reviews have pointed out this is a book with a middle-aged or older man's sexual fantasies about a younger girl. It probably reveals more about how men think then men really should be revealing but it is certainly Edward Abbey in every way shape and form.Abbey's descriptions of fire lookout and the work there are outstanding and I loved it. The whole romance narrative (and I'm somewhat reluctant to use that word) would have ruined the book if it were not for the ending. The ending is pure, Edward Abbey magic but I intend to reveal no more. It is worth the read.(BTW: Good backpack book. Light, paperback, and fits the surroundings)"
3,"Not exactly ""fine furniture""","This is definitely *not* a piece of ""fine furniture."" The ""hand carved"" vertical rods are basically just dowls with slight irregularities. The finish is very spotty with lots of blemishes. Some of the joints have gaps in them. A big piece of the finish came off when I peeled off the factory sticker.That said, it works for me because I want a piece that looks like it's been around for a while (i.e. it looks a bit ""distressed"") and it is generally attractive and sturdy.For the money, I expected much better craftsmanship, but because I wanted something that looked a bit ""antique"" I'm satisfied with what I got. My biggest concern is that I can't say how well the finish will hold up over time, since it seems to come off so easily."
4,excellent product -- fast delivery,"I have used this product for over 20 years when hay fever time approaches. My drug store no longer carries it, so I ordered here. Received in just a few days. I'm happy and so is my nose!"
4,"A ""must have"" Christmas book!","I enjoyed this book, especially since I was born in 1942. Those of us who are oldsters grew up in a fun time. It was also interesting for me since I currently ""play"" with old Lionel trains, as well as my large View Master collection. We have 2 Christmas trees each year, and it takes me 8 hours to decorate the 9' one. My only nit-pick with the book is that flocked trees were a '50s thing, and aluminum was the '60s...not the other way around."
5,Great Chairs,These chairs are very nice and exactly the color I wanted. The legs are adjustable on the bottom to level the chairs. Definitely worth the $.
5,Love at first sight,"One of the best books I've read in years. I fell in love with the main character (and the author). Full of raw emotion, moving descriptions and lots of action, the book is definitely hard to put down."
3,Family History collection,"This book was purchased for my Family History book collection. It was not necessarily an easy, enjoyable read!! I was not very impressed with it."
1,BLand,"This book put me to sleep at every single corner. There was nothing interesting about it, I will never EVER read anything from Mary P. Ryan again."
4,crunchless abs,"Excellent anatomically for building functional strength. Cueing is decent. I would not suggest this for beginners, you need some knowledge and workout experience in order to do this properly."
4,Great...if it's your cup of tea.,"I think this CD was great, but you have to be into dark trance. Thats pretty much what the cd is. The whole cd is listenable, a few tracks are annoying like Track 3 on CD1 and few more. Plus the intro to both of the CD's are a little lame. But let me just say that Ricky Fobis - No Regular is sooo gooood. OMG its one of the best dark trance tunes I've heard ever. Also Lamda - Hold on Tight is great. It's worth a hear if you have the money to pay for this import."
1,Bean container critical to operation easily damaged,"The Capresso 565 Infinity Conical Burr Grinder is an excellent product in all ways but one: The bean container on top critical to the machine's operation is easily damaged.Along the bottom of the container is a ridge that inserts into the base of the grinder. The rotation of that basket sets the coarseness of the grind. When putting the machine away after one of its first uses, the bean container took about a three-foot tumble onto the counter-top and chipped a little more than an inch off of the ridge. Because of this, the grinder will operate only on the Fine and Coarse settings. (It seems likely that more of that ridge will break off eventually, perhaps in the grinder itself, rendering it useless.)Worst of all, even though Capresso includes an insert warning against breaking the ridge -- which is an admission that the product is poorly-designed -- they refuse to replace the container."
3,Disappointed,"I was very excited to be replacing my old Krups burr grinder as I never could get a fine enough grind for espresso. Based on the reviews of this machine I was hopeful. Sorry to say that I am finding that even at the finest setting, I do not get a powder. Nothing even close to espresso let alone Turkish.Otherwise it seems like a well made grinder. For drip or French Press coffee it does the job quietly, cleanly and consistently. Just not going to help me with my espresso issue."
4,Very Good Coffee Grinder,"The Capresso Burr Grinder replaced a Mr. Coffee Burr Grinder, so that unit is the basis for my comparisons.Pros: The Capresso is much quieter and produces much less statis electricity than the Mr. Coffee unit. It also grinds to a 100% uniform consistency. Its bean resevoir is larger, so that refilling is needed less often.Cons: The amount of coffee ground is determined by a simple, mechanical timer switch. The motor starts the instant that you start to set the timer and there are no detents to assist you in setting the timer exactly where you set it the last time. As a result, I end up grinding, then measuring to get precisely the same amount of coffee in the brewer.On the whole, I am happy with the unit and would recommend it."
4,Get the job done,"Cleaning and charge is not that messy like what some people said. The grinding doesn't seem that even, as I still get sediment when using coarse setting for french press."
5,Good for Turkish Coffee,I bought this item from Amazon Warehouse deals. It was refurbished but condition was perfect that no one can tell its refurbished. I tried the machine this morning to make my Turkish coffee. Grind is fine enough to make Turkish coffee and also it was consistent. The machine has very negligible noise level. I have not tried coarser settings but I believe if it can grind fine enough for Turkish coffee other settings should do a good job also. For this price range (I bought for $58 refurbished) it was a steal but if you wanna buy new one with $89 price tag it is still good.I first bought Cousinart Burr grinder but I am returning it because grind was not fine enough. I replaced with this machine and now I am enjoying my lovely Turkish coffee.
4,Capresso 565 Infinity Burr Grinder,"This is an excellent burr grinder for the price- something that onemight call a ""best buy."" Compared to my former household spinningblade grinders, it produces a far more uniform grind, yielding neitherexcessive chunks nor excessive fines for the settings I've tried overthe three weeks I have owned it. As opposed to some reviews that Iread, I find it simple to operate and easy to clean. With the beans Ihave used so far, more dry than oily, the gears have not gummed up. Itmay not be the choice for the coffee purist or connoisseur, but forthe average coffee drinker like myself, it has proved an excellentchoice."
4,Burr Grinder by Capresso,"The Infinity Burr Grinder by Capresso works well andoffers a myriad of grinds from extra fine to verycoarse. I have been using it for one month and findthe coffee for both an electric espresso machineand an electric drip machine equally flavorful.It is a good value.Barbara Wasser, co-authorDivine Kosher Cuisine"
5,outstanding grinder for the price,"There have been quite a few reviews on this grinder, so I don't feel the need to go into *too* much detail, but a few things about it caught my attention:- The finest grinding setting is FINE. Like dust fine. I use mine for espresso, and I keep it five clicks from the finest setting. Much finer than that, and it will clog my portafilter. This has made a *huge* difference in the taste of the espresso.- The plastic hopper has little to no static, which struck me as unusual. I can pour the grinds right out of the hopper, and none are stuck to the side. I'm not sure if this was by design or some lucky, lucky coincidence, but it's great.- It's relatively quiet. We can have a conversation while it's grinding, and it doesn't wake up the baby in the morning (which is HUGE).- Watch it if you use really oily beans - it will eventually clog. If you don't mind cleaning it (which is ridiculously easy), then no worries.Bottom line: if you're thinking about getting it, get it."
5,Works Well,"I have had this grinder for about a week and so far I am very pleased with it. This is my first burr grinder, before that I had the usual blade grinder, and I am happy to report that I much prefer this way of grinding. The coffee grind is obviously much more consistent, and the precise control of grind size makes it much easier to grind for my various coffee makers (drip and french press).It is quite easy to clean and I have not found static to be a problem, so long as you give the side of the machine a few pats after running it (as the instructions say.) The only annoyance with mine is that the grind collector tends to want to move out as the machine runs, just a little bit. However, all of the grinds still find there way into the chamber and there is no mess as a result.I am still trying to figure out exactly the right setting for the timer to not grind too much or too little, but once I figure all of that out I'm going to be even more happy with this purchase."
5,Happy with my new Capresso burr grinder,"I read all the reviews before deciding to purchase the Capresso 560.01 Infinity burr grinder, which replaced our old, cheap blade grinder. I was concerned about the clean-up comments, but have found that to be a very minor and easy part of the process. I'm very happy with the Capresso after about 1-2 months of great coffee."
4,Get a good cup of coffee,"If you want a good cup of coffee you need a conical burr grinder, there is simply no way around it. This unit is clean and straight forward no extra features or funky shapes to get in the way. Easy to clean. Sure beats the spinning blade grinder. The only problem is the container that catches the grounds tends to shake its way out slightly, so put my bag of beans in front to prevent this, it does get irratating. I have also seen this same unit in stainless steal, but at twice the price I went for the black one instead. All in all its pretty good, not the junk you might find at your local target or walmart stores."
2,Not appropriate for French Press,"Overall, this is a good machine. However, I purchased it specifically for grinding coffee for a French Press, and this grinder's coarsest setting is a medium grind, which is too fine. The over-extraction that results makes a bitter cup of coffee. Although the machine does produce a relatively good and consistent grind, it is more suitable for making coffee in a drip machine than with a French Press. For my purposes, there is little to no difference between the quality of the coffee produced with the Capresso than with a cheap blade grinder."
4,Great grinder,"I bought this as an espresso grinder and I am using my 15 year old Krups for drip coffee. I will soon be buying another of the Capresso units for the drip as well.Grinds a very fine ""dust"" for the espresso. Does a fine job with coarser grinding too.The only downside is that you have to turn the timer to the same spot each day. My dad's older capresso had a timer setting and then you pushed the button to start it. This helps to get a consistent amount each time."
1,Save Yourself and Do Not Buy.,"I can't tell you how frustrating this product is. For months I have struggled with its most ridiculous, senseless manufacture...only to replace it and eat the cost after countless mornings of irritation. Do not buy this stupid grinder."
5,capresso infinity burr grinder,I do not think I need to waste any more time I gave it five 5 starsPlease do not send me any more of these requests for a verbal response I find it troubling and tedious.I am happy to give a star rating .
1,Believe the 1 star reviews!,"Some reviewers reported this machine clogging up.We've had the machine less than a week and it clogged up and stopped grinding coffee.It is going back as quickly as possible. We have an old inexpensive Braun that's worked great for years, but needed a second one and were hoping this would be decent. We aren't that particular about the grind, but not grinding at all is stunning."
4,Good grinder for the price,"This is definitely a ""cut above"" blade grinders. It's quiet and produces reasonably consistent grounds. It seems well made; I don't worry about anything breaking or wearing out quickly. The biggest flaw is how much ground coffee gets trapped in the mechanism. It will steal a good-sized scoop of grounds from the first batch after cleaning. If you don't clean it regularly, lots of old grounds are lurking in there to mix with the new. I gave it four stars because better grinders cost so much more. If you want to step up from hacking your beans with a blade but aren't prepared to make a major investment, this could be a good choice."
1,bean container does not seat properly,Never got a chance to use this product as the bean container does not fit properly into the machine. I lined up the dots as the instructions showed and cracked the very thin plastic flange of the container. This grinder is very poorly engineered and I will return it as I have alrready purchased a Cuisinart.
3,Works Good But Feels Cheap,This coffee grinder for some reason always leaves a mess on the counter after a grind which I guess its a design flaw and when it comes time to clean it you always have old grounds on the inside. One time I forgot to clean it for a week b/c I thought my wife did and by the time I looked inside it was enough old coffee to make about a 4 cup pot. It grinds just fine yet I cant taste a difference in this $90 version compared to my $20 blade grinder which could be more due to the coffee I drink. As long as you keep it clean it works really good with nice grind settings and so far I have had no problems but it feels kinda cheap and not well thought out for $90.
2,Died,"My grinder is 6 months old and finally died. It is the second one I received since I returned the first one. It was always hard to get back into the holder in order to start grinding, and it finally won't click on now. Oak very disgusted with the price of this item and the quality. I just received a new bodum and it is way quieter!!! This was also very loud, waking the entire house up."
2,Not fine enough,"I bought a second burr grinder for decaf (doctor's orders). Decadent I know. I have a Baratza G 285 Maestro Conical Burr Grinder that works great although after a few years the tiny ears on the bean holder broke off and now it is permanently set to one grind. but I digress.The Capresso grinder cannot grind fine enough for espresso! The courseness of the grind creates a shot without the great crema head that one should expect from a perfect shot. It also has too many rules regarding fine grind. Since it is used I don't know if I can send it back, but I would like to.I would recommend the Baratza for $20 more over the Capresso."
4,Amazon pricing deception,"2/20/07 I just checked the Capresso website and they list the 560 at $90, the 565 at $140. Amazon has inflated their MSRP's to the point that I will now research every item I purchase from them."
3,"OK. Somewhat messy, short life","The item was purchased in October 2007. It did a good job of grinding coffee, until it died about a week agoUntil that time, the only downside was that the receptacle for the ground coffee would ease out while grinding and ground coffee that would come out and also get between it and the machine. This residual ground coffee had to be cleaned out in order for the receptacle to be put back in for grinding."
4,"Almost perfect burr grinder, great value","I bought the black grinder for my home use. Great burr grinder with a wide range of grind settings, large hopper, easy-to-use operation. Makes a very consistent grind. Easy to assemble and clean. I don't notice the static in the drawer that others have commented on but have only used it in the more humid months. My few, very minor complaints:1. In the hopper, there is a rubber ring above the burrs where a single bean seems to get stuck on almost a daily basis requiring a little shake of the machine. Not a big deal, but still...2. The timer dial is a bit of a trial-and-error. I never know how much to turn the knob. Sometimes I need to crank again, sometimes it grinds for more than is needed. I wish there were an auto shut-off. Again, not a big deal.Overall, a very good value and any cons are immediately outweighs by the overall function. I would definitely recommend for the average home coffee drinker."
1,Not impressed- died after 2 years with light use,"I just got off the phone after speaking with Capresso's customer service representative. I have owned this machine (565) for 2 years, without a lot of heavy use. It just died on me. Timer works, but no grinding action. I cleaned the grinding gears, but it was of use. Now, it's a doorstop. My response from Capresso's customer service is that it will cost either 80.00 to repair OR 80.00 to replace. Not much of a bargain. I was hoping to get a couple more years out of an appliance that cost me 139.99. The cheap Proctor Silex blade grinder that I owned for 10 years was still working when I gave it away on Freecycle. Now, I wish I held onto it."
2,Wanted to love it bt couldn't -constantly needs cleaning!,"Chose this one because of reviews. The grinder was good but cleaning this unit is soooo time consuming...And if you do not clean it daily, you will have old stale grounds getting into your next batch of ground coffee. You have to take it all apart remove the grinder part and there is lots of coffee grinds stuck in there. The brush that comes with it to clean is just silly, does nothing. Tapping it as per instructions does a very limited job. So many grounds are stuck inside the machine that you waste a lot of coffee each time you grind. Also the bowl that holds the coffee beans was hard to align after several times of removal...which meant it was going to break or chip in short time. Just sooooo much effort!"
4,Very Effective Grinder,I find this economically priced grinder very effective for grinding coffee beans. I have a blade grinder and have not used it since receiving this unit. I like that I can vary the grind from very fine to very coarse. This allows me to select different methods of preparing a cup of coffee ... it accomodates my moods.
2,Not Pleased,"I gave this grinder two stars because the grinding part does work OK. Getting the coffee grind cup out of the machine is the problem. It just can't be done without the grinds going all over the counter. I've had to put it in the sink when I remove the cup. Look for another grinder, there's bound to be a better one.I purchased this one in early Nov 2007 and have used it alot and the mess has always been a problem!P.S. This is the only review that I have EVER wrote, so you can see that I feel strongly about this grinder."
5,Best conical grinder for the money,"Quiet, powerful, and well made. Did my homework and it payed off. If you're looking for a grinder, this is the one to get. Enough said."
1,Avoid if possible!!,"We have had this grinder less than one month. It does not grind on the ""Fine"" setting at all, and has to be dismantled and cleaned between each use or the grinder will clog. The grinder, when working, is also very slow."
1,Rusted before using,"I wrote a review before about how the burr grinder piece rusted after I rinsed it off to remove the chemical smell from the plastic. After some back-and-forth, including being told ""it's not possible for the burr grinder to rust, it's stainless steel"" they agreed to replace it for free.The replacement rusted after one rinse and dry.I haven't even USED the machine yet. I'm returning it. Thank goodness I bought through Amazon and not from Capresso directly, because I'm sure I'd get a lot of grief from the manufacturer. If they are using stainless steel, it's a poor quality."
4,Cleaning My Capresso Burr Grinder,Makes your coffee taste better. Does a good job grinding to a specific value you select by simply rotating the top bean bin to a clearly marked position on the front. The only real issue I have with this unit is clean-up. They do send a small brush that helps. I bought a larger brush just for coffee grinders at BB&B for $3 and it helps also but to get the unit clean so you don't worry about cross contaminating different coffee's cleaning is a problem. Yes I am too particular about this issue but I want the best tasting coffee in the world first thing in the morning. I went so far as to buy a small vacuum with small attachments like you see for computer keyboards and things. That does the job but it is a lot of work for just a simple cup of coffee isn't it!
4,"Great product, great price!","This grinder is my first grinder so my experience is limited, however I am very pleased thus far. It's easy to use, beans are uniformly ground, and it's easy to clean. I would highly recommend!"
2,Too coarse,"I bought this grinder based on the number of positive reviews, but have not been happy. I have a home espresso machine that is also produced by Capresso, the Model 302. The espresso maker requires a very fine grind to get good flavor from the beans. If the grind is too coarse, the steam runs through the grounds too quickly and the result is watery, more of an Americano than an espresso. Although this particular grinder has settings for a ""Very Fine"" grind and the instructions indicate it can grind beans for a Turkish coffee, the best I can get out of it is a medium grind that is barely serviceable for drip coffee. I've taken it apart and cleaned it and have looked for other adjustments to no avail. My old spinning blade grinder produced a finer grind than this machine is capable of, and cost 1/10 as much. I am frustrated and disappointed."
5,awesome and quiet,"I have owned three mid-level, expense, grinders and this one is the best. Better than kitchen aid and Breville burr grinders."
2,Another complait about static MESS,"As grinder it works fine, but as soon as you pull out you see the grinded beans fly all over you kitchen counter. I don't understand how they could design with such plastic. Otherwise I like the grinder, but with such annoyance, I gave 2 star.Has anyone found the ways to reduce the static?"
3,Just not for espresso....,"Bought this grinder last summer based on all the good reviews. This is probably a perfectly adequate grinder for everything from coarse, French press through fine grind for drip. However, it simply doesn't grind fine enough for good espresso.It seems to ""flake"" the coffee instead of grinding it to the fine powder necessary to pull a good shot (I'm using a La Pavoni lever machine). Even at the finest setting, the granules are too large, and rather than getting the mouse tails that mark a well-pulled shot, you'll get coffee that overextracts and doesn't produce good crema.I thought this would be an inexpensive to the old, industrial-strength La Pavoni conical burr grinder that finally gave up its ghost last summer. But it wasn't. I'm not strong enough to compensate for the coarse texture with a Superman-level tamp.Nothing wrong with the grinder. Does a fine job, easy to clean, relatively quiet. Just, as I said, ""not for espresso."""
4,Great grinder!,"There is no comparison between this and a blade grinder. WOW! what a difference. This grinds evenly every time. I love the variety of settings it has, sixteen in all.I use the fine grind for Turkish coffee, the medium for a drip maker, and the smallest course grind for my perculator.It works great on all the settings. Takes a little more to clean it after the very fine grinds or if you use a really dark, oily roast but I'm sure any grinder would. Overall I'm very satisfied.I've been using this grinder for several months now and I still love it. It does a great job."
1,"Capresso 580 burr grinder, avoid at all costs!","I have a Capresso 580 burr grinder, a smaller version of the 565. In a year and a half, the motor has burned out twice, and is obviously a poor design, so avoid at all costs. The company stands behind their warranty, but with a catch: the consumer is still left with significant postage/shipping costs to return the defective grinder. After the first motor burned out, I began cleaning the replacement daily, but to no avail, as it also burned out 7 months later. If the company were truly being honest, they would return the purchase price of all 580s, as they simply do not work for the task intended."
4,"Nice Machine, competitive pricing","I've had this unit about a month now, and I must say I wish I would have used a burr grinder from the begining, instead of the common blade grinder. What I like the most about this unit is it grinds at a slow speed, and has a full range of grind settings, from coarse, to very fine, which would satisfy just about anyones tastes. The grind is even and consistent, no fine powder to create any bitterness. Cleaning takes a bit more time with this machine, but to me its worth it, simply because the difference in the pot of coffee is amazing!"
2,"Very messy, clogs if you use fine setting","The pros: grinds well on medium and higher setting, quiet.The cons: lots of static electricity in cup, very messy, clogs if you use fine setting.I would not buy this again."
4,works great; takes some getting used to,This coffee grinder works great. It takes about 4 uses to get used to it. The clear top got coffee beans dumped on it more that once; opaque might be better. I grind 1 pound of coffee on the most course grind to use in a coffee Toddy cold water maker. I was worried that the grind wouldn't be course enough but using the most current directions on making the coffee from ToddyCafe.com the grinder provides the perfect ingredient.
3,"Burr grinder ""sticks""","I have bought two of these grinders and had problems with both. It grinds well, but ground coffee often sticks in the center burr and discharge chute, and the grinder must be dismantled to clean it out. The coffee catcher fits loosely. I used a rubber band to secure it. Some ground coffee falls out when the catcher is removed. The lid of the bean hopper also fits loosely.However, the worst problem is that both units burned out after a short period of use (less than a year). The motor is not repairable (I tried).I am giving up on this model and trying a Kitchen Aid Proline instead."
4,I love this stuff....,I've been using this product for over a year now...and I love it...I have naturally curly hair that i get relaxed every three months to loosen the curls...and this is the only leave in that I have found that not only smells great (I get lots of compliments)...but makes my curls look great and have bounce to it...I use the leave in as well as the Tui Oil...great products...great product line...highly reccomended...
2,A startup book for those at the very beginning,"The Silicon Valley Way reads like a self-help workbook for those who have little to no idea where to start in technology entrepreneurship. It's not for the seasoned, or even lightly seasoned, entrepreneur. This isn't necessarily a cut against the book, but I feel like I'm owed 45 secrets, not a worksheet on whether or not I should sell over the internet."
3,pebble bison,"I got the japenese Rock Bison and it was so so the eg gear is a no clutch base so it realeases right after you take of the winder,so w/ that out of the way lets go.attack ring-3.5/5,good defence ok attack mediocore balence.weight disk-5/5,normal 10 balence.blade base-1/5,the secureing clip flys off when hit,worst part of it.3/5.ok blade not great,but not bad."
4,Psychic Love Ball,"This is a Christmas gift and hasn't been received yet, but we have an old one and it is a lot of fun. Came quickly as promised. Satified!"
5,THIS BLADE IS THE BEST,"After I finished putting together Wolborg 4 first thing I did was LET IT RIP! With the engine gear wound up this blade rocks! Even without the engine gear wound up this blade rocks! So if you don't have it yet, GET IT!!"
2,Beware,This is advertised and billed as card stock but it is only cover stock. The paper is nice for what it is - just not what I needed.
5,Happy mommy = happy kid at lunchtime,"We are super happy with this thermos. I bought one at first, but plan to buy a second today, so both of my kids can enjoy a warm - if not hot - lunch. With their sensitive palates, warm is good enough. I like the ease of washing, though would like it even better if it were dishwasher safe. Soup, Spaghetti-os, and more have been happily served to my two kids thanks to this perfectly-sized thermos."
2,NOT GREAT,"I bought two of these having read the 'positive' reviews. Unfortunately, my kids don't rate these as their 'hot' food for lunch at school is luke warm by the time they have it at 12.30pm! It's packed at 7.30am and, yes, I've heated the Thermos with boiling water beforehand too. Would I buy these again - NO. Very stylish though but hopeless."
3,Ok - not great,"I bought this 16 oz bottle along with a thermos. This bottle does not leak, but does not seem to keep the food as hot as the thermos does the liquids I put in it. I prime the bottle with boiling water in the morning and put food right off the stove in it. Four hours later the food is fairly warm, but not hot. In comparison, I prime the thermos with hot tap water and that works fine (tried this with the bottle and results were poor, hence the boiling water). Maybe I got a bum one, but I would not recommend this bottle for anyone looking to keep the food actually hot.PS. Love the thermos - same manufacturer - so go figure."
2,Not what I expected,"I have both the Thermos Nissan 16 oz and the 10 oz jars for a couple of days and so far they have been disappointing.Even with pre-heating, the food (oatmeal) is a ""cold"" luke warm after only 6 hours, too cool in my opinion to keep some foods safe to eat.Perhaps it's better suited to soup and I will be trying that next week but I would not trust it with anything meat based."
4,hard to open lid,"I had the tiger lunch jar set and this is actually better. the instruction says it keeps food hot for 5 hrs. there is a bigger one that says it keeps food hot for 7 hr, but that size too big for me. My food is still not piping hot but the temp is still hot enough for me. only thing was I found it hard to open the lid at first. It took me almost 10 mins to try before I was finally able to open it. also my lunch jar doesn't have the orange spot on the lid."
2,"Lovely unit, wish it held heat better","I've used a variety of stainless steel mugs and thermos in the past. I ordered these because my kids wanted something sleek to carry lunch for school. Following the directions to preheat the units with boiling water for 10 min. prior to filling with heated food, boiling hot soup put in the thermos at seven a.m. was tepid at 12:30 p.m. just five and a half hours later. Other stainless steel thermos(es?)/thermi I've used held things much hotter. Design wise these are lovely. Perhaps the thermos I received were flukes."
1,Another tragic attack from a liberal Bishop,"Richard Holloway attacks fundamental theology with a series of personal attacks that are unfounded. Many Christians with fundamental beliefs do question their beliefs and think them through and discuss them, and to say that our views of sexuality are from the Gnostic Church defies the writings of many New Testament scholars who say otherwise. It is sad and tragic about the state of the Church today that yet another Bishop can come out with such a piece of work. Thankfully these are in the minority but are very vocal."
3,"Not great, but not horrible either. 3 1/2 stars.","With this box set we see the start of a long string of filler episodes in Naruto.Personally I have mixed feelings about these episodes. While none of the filler arcs have much depth and aren't nearly as engrossing as the main story, they can still be fun to watch. In fact, some of them are fairly interesting. We get to see a more obscure character like Mizuki get fleshed out a bit more, and, canonical or not, it actually gives him a motive for his actions in the first episode.In conclusion if you want some extra Naruto and don't mind filler, then you won't be wasting your money on this set. However, if you want to see the story actually progress, save up and wait for Shippuden to come out."
5,Excellent tool!,These strips are easy to use. I even give them to my friends and family so that they can monitor their own PH levels. They last a long time.
2,Just So-So,"This was a fine idea that didn't pan out so well. The stories are all pulled from some part of Jules Verne's works, but for the most part are themselves boring, the exception being the ones about Captain Nemo. Spend your hard-earned money on something more worthy."
2,Interesting ideas but too loosely written,"While I found his concepts very interesting and many of his stories beautiful in and of thesmelves, Nabhan fails to bring his book into a cohesive argument. He vaguely alludes to his concepts of the importance of biodiversity to cultures, and how a diversity of cultures promotes biodiversity, I felt as if I were drowning in nostalgia as he told this and that tale without making their significance clear and... significant.There were interesting thoughts and stories, but as an entire book, it disappointed me."
1,Worked great for about 2 minutes,"There is not much to these, the one I received worked as advertised for about 2 minutes then died."
1,Item did not work,"Received item. Did not hook it up for several weeks, but when I did it did not work. Bought from Smart Digital - sent them the order number - never heard back. Don't know if it is just bad luck or bad product since I never got a replacement."
1,DOESNT WORK. THIS THING SUCKS!,"I bought this to catch my optical out from my TV to send it to my stereo receiver that is not optical and it doesn't work. I have tried it on the PS3 with other audio equipment and all types of different setups and this thing will not get an audio signal to ANY audio device!It's crap, don't buy it.I've had it for over a yr and a half and have not come across one component that this will work with, I have tried all sorts of different setups and different cables and nothing, not even a low volume signal, just nothing!Save your money and save up for something better, this is not worth the plastic it is made out of!!!!Worst Amazon purchase ever!!!And for everyone who doesn't listen and then comes back here and sees this review again after having problems with it.....""I told you so..."""
4,Digital Fiber Optical (Toslink) to Digital Coaxial (S/PDIF) Converter,"This Device ease to use, excellence sound .Just a few notes for those that might be thinking of getting it this Digital Fiber Optical (Toslink) to Digital Coaxial (S/PDIF) Converter"
1,Works great for as long as it works,"I purchased this product, connected it and it worked for about a week with static before it failed completely. Purchased another one from a different vendor in different packaging to replace the failed unit, and the new unit has worked flawlessly ever since. It is a good product, once you have a working unit."
5,Works Perfectly!,I needed this to use to convert the optical to digital coax from my Xbox 360 - works perfectly! Games are always better digital and LOUD!
3,The Genius misses the mark...,"I have to calls em like I sees em...This, I think is the low point in Bryans solo career. While there are few moments (Sign of the Times..) I have no idea what is goin on here..Pick up ""These Foolish Things"" to see the Master at work. I think Mr. Ferry might agree."
3,so-so,This big item does not cool a big room very well. Reminder: the BTU is only 8500 so it is recommended that you buy this item for a large bedroom or a small living room; otherwise your room will take forever to cool down.Half of the plastic grill that directs air vertically were delivered broken but it is such a big item to repack and return so I decided just to keep it to eleviate the burden. I'm not sure if it was poorly packed or it was poorly delivered.....probably a bit of both.
2,KW85,"I bought this last month and just like other people, the box came damaged and taped together. It is a very load and very, very big unit. The new safety plug trips all the time (even though the circuit is clean and the unit is the only device on it). I would not recommend this product."
2,A Stinker,"I saw this movie a while ago, and all I can remember is how much I didn't like it. From what I could understand, there was a boy, who pretty much did nothing. Then every once in a while, he'd flash back to early childhood, and he'd be standing in the middle of a circle of children who were chanting ""hi ho the derrio, the cheese stands alone..."" Rent it if you think there's more to the movie than I've found, but I wouldn't reccomend it."
4,No more aimless and hungry wandering...,I am new to New York city and have been discovering good (and bad) places to eat in a hit or miss fashion. I was given this book as a gift and it has become more useful than the Vindigo guide I have been using on my Palm Pilot.
4,cool music!,"I'm used to Indian ragas and gamelan music - the 'mysterious music of the Orient' - being used as settings for the Beatles and Yes. But when the lyrics have nothing to do with walruses and psychedelic colors, but instead speak of God, yearning, and the inevitability of decay, the effect is stunning AND deepening. While Glass' musicianship is fine and his voice pleasantly unaffected, it's the juxtaposition with these religious texts (masterfully rendered into thoughtful English on the album cover) that makes these tracks less performances than commentaries of deep profundity. I would not recommend this music to everybody at every occasion, but for someone ready to hear music that will transport them, 'Knower of Secrets' is uniquely positioned to do so, especially among the limited styles that are currently labelled 'Jewish music'."
4,Modern Mood of Old,Matching old and modern rythm with ancient language is used to produce a meditative mood for occasional listening. Well worth contemplating its message
1,Useless,"Bought at Walmart for $22. My intended use was for baseboard cleaning and cobwebs, plus my husband said he wanted the smaller shop vac for years. The suction is very powerful but the cord and hose attachment are so short they render the product useless. Taking it back..."
5,GNARKILL is funny as HELL,When I saw Haggard and I saw Gnarkill playing on stage it was funny as hell.Gnarkill is one of my Top 5 fav. bands!(They need a website)
3,TYPICAL ALARM CLOCK,"WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS I THOUGHT THAT THE ALARM WOULD HAVE SPONGEBOB'S VOICE WAKING YOU UP - BUT IT'S ONLY YOUR TYPICAL BUZZARD. PLUS I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ""NIGHT LIGHT"" - I THOUGHT YOU COULD SET THE LIGHT TO STAY ON TO BE USED AS A CHILD'S ACTUAL NIGHT LIGHT - BUT ALL THE FEATURE IS - YOU CAN PRESS DOWN ON THE CLOCK AND IT WILL ILLUMINATE THE TIME, AS SOON AS YOU LIFT YOUR HAND THE LIGHT GOES OUT."
5,Very Helpful!,"A great help for the Biology class I'm in! Not sure what else there is to say about a Biology Book, but I needed 11 more words..."
1,Broke upon opening for the first time,"The design is nice, but the tracks fro the metak joints are super flimsy. It came out of the track the first time opening. My son, 11, used it twice and the metal finally became so fatigued it broke.This this is cheap and worthless.DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!"
1,Disappointing Costume,"Costume was too thin, the cape was too tight with only a 1/2 inch velcro strip binding it together on the neck. Also, the cape was too small in relation to the costume. My grandnephew did not like it very much, but wore it just to be superman for a while."
4,okay quality for a single season,"We got this costume because our son will not wear hats or face masks. It goes over clothes very well, so good if you are in a cold climate. Colors are exactly as pictured."
2,not worth it!!,product arrived..material is VERY thin and had holes in it!! I will never buy a halloween costume online again!! I had to put a ton of clothing underneath! Thumbs down!
3,Decent but one complaint.,"My three year old loves it, but I was either sent the wrong size or they need to change the listing. I selected 2-4 years (the options available were 6-12 mos and 2-4 y), and on the package I got it says 1-2 years, which wasn't even an option to order. It fits him ok everywhere except the legs (about an inch too short), so I won't return. One other minor thing is it could use another piece of velcro in the middle of the cape, it sags in the middle and that would fix it. I think I'll prob just tape it for the big night. Not a bad costume for the price, I just wish it was actually his size. But it will work for Halloween this year! He's running around and excited so all is good."
5,My 100-word book review,"Fans of Frank Schätzing's novel The Swarm might be interested to know that the 2004 bestseller had a 1953 precursor in John Wyndham's The Kraken Wakes, another novel featuring humanity under threat from mysterious forces operating beneath the sea. Ignore the middle-class twittering of the two main characters and, instead, enjoy Wyndham's relentless build-up of tension, punctuated by some truly chilling moments, as inhuman entities escalate their attacks. The Kraken Wakes is a personal favourite of mine, from way back, and has much that is relevant today, including such topics as international inertia in the face of abrupt climate change."
5,TRULY REVOLUTIONARY,"THROW ALL YOUR ""DIET"" BOOKS OUT THE WINDOW! THIS BOOK WILL TRULY OPEN YOUR EYE'S AND YOU WILL ""FINALLY"" DISCOVER THE TRUTH ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD BE EATING, WEIGHT LOSS AND, EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, HELP TO PUT AN END TO THE HORRENDOUS TORTURE OF INNOCENT ANIMALS. ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMEND ""THE CHINA STUDY"" BY T. COLEN CAMPBELL PHD. YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED."
5,Should be required reading,10 years after the first publication and it is still the best read on the subject out there. Well researched with notes on all facts and easy and entertaining to read (although difficult emotionally at times).
2,Meh,"I placed my order for one 56-oz bag of M&M's only to receive 18 bags of 3.27-oz peanut M&M's. Although that means I received 58.86-oz overall, this product listing is inaccurate."
3,Misleading Product Description,"I purchased this item thinking the product that would be delivered would be what was described. The product was NOT the 56oz. bag that was described or pictured. The box contained multiple, smaller bagged M&M's. It turns out, I preferred the smaller bagged goodies. It would have been nice though, if there was better oversight."
2,Expired date,Mars is a great company but they should not allow anyone to ship out of date products--this product expired in 2011 and it is May 2012
3,quick read,"Decent, but do what I did--read it in the store. While light-hearted and often amusing, do not go to this text if you are looking for resourceful marketing ideas and strategies. As other reviewers have noted, the analyisis is sparse. The case studies are on point, that I will admit; however, a how and why is the backbone of any rigorous work that wants to be taken seriously. Unfortunately, this text positions itself in quite another vein."
2,dont waste your time,"This book really is tripe, from the perspective of actually learning anything about guerrilla marketing other then a series of extremely brief case studies.The examples were good, and brought to light a few interesting ideas, but at the end of the day the author simply presented these one after the other, alongside a series of pictures of chairman mao photoshopped in.The issue was none of these examples were followed through in anyway, and there was zero analysis.While the author clearly made an attempt to make this book light hearted and amusing, it really didn't work, and ultimately provided very little useful information and made light of the attrocities commited by this dictator.I simply cannot reccomend it to anyone."
1,Awful----Don't buy!,"As other reviewers have pointed out, these things start to ""shed"" paint very fast all over everything, INCLUDING YOUR FOOD!!!!!!!!I had to throw out a steak last night because I couldn't get the little pieces of red paint off it.The paint is very sticky and has to be scrubbed hard to remove from counter tops.Do yourself a favor and avoid these products.In my opinion, they ought to be taken off the market."
2,Peeling designs,"These work well as silicone cutting boards, they're thicker than the normal flexible cutting boards which is nice, though they don't fold over as much when you try to use them to funnel the food into a bowl/pan.My biggest complaint is that I have only used them about a dozen times now and the color designs that are ""painted"" on the back of the boards are starting to rub off. If they are left leaning against or hanging on a wall the wall get colored streaks from the colored designs rubbing off. It also rubs off on the other boards making you have to make sure it isn't on the cutting surface of the board before you use them."
5,Headband,Item arrived as stated as was as advertised. They are great for cycling or just out in the cold.
4,"Warm, but small","The headband that they sent is really warm, but it feels too small. I don't know if it stretches over time so one size fits all. If it does, it will be a very good head band for me. If it doesn't, I'll have to give it to my daughter."
3,Duplicate,This headband is exactly the same as the cheaper Port Authority Fleece Headband from the same distributor - order the cheaper one - they are the same.They are nice headbands though I just ordered another color and Shipping is not out of this world at $1
1,Don't bother to buy it!,"I got this as a Christmas gift & was pleased in the beginning. Then the door wouldn't open using the remote or the front panel buttons. Customer service is a bad joke; they don't answer their 800 number. It took 2 hours of being on hold to find out there is no local service available,you have to send it in for repair. If you read other customer reviews, this unit is notorious for the door not opening. Liteon is aware of the poor design yet they choose to not correct the problem. Avoid it at all costs. They managed to lose my unit & I have been unable to trace it."
1,Stopped Working,"You'll see another review where someone says the DVD laser simply stops working around 7 months if you keep the unit on. I didn't know this when I bought it. I kept it on, and sure enough, 7 months later it stopped working.Based on the reviews about the nighmare of dealing with their support and/or replacement equipment, I'm just going to cut my losses. Time to look for a well known name brand and purchase an extended warranty.Lesson learned. Don't buy this unit."
1,LITEON STOPPED SUPORTING THIS PRODUCT,"Just learned, in the hard way, that Liteon stopped supporting this model. I sent my unit out for repair, for the second time in six months, and was informed that Liteon will replace my unit with a newer model. Unfortunately the ""newer model"" does not support PAL or multi region formats. Liteon refuses to even try to repair my unit. Very rude customer service.Stay away from this manufacturer."
2,Burning DVD+R's,"I didnt use the product for about a month after I received it, then when I started to use it , every thing worked fine EXCEPT, WHEN I would try and burn DVD+R disc's 3 out of 5 would not finalize and I would have to start ALL OVER again. I've RUINED about 30 NEW BLANK DVD+R disc's. I've called LITEON Tech Support and the are in the process of sending me an UPDATE for the LVW-Liteon5005 DVD/Recorder, bot that was about 3 weeks ago. Since then I've called them back and found out that they sent the recorder to the WRONG address( DID NOT SPELL MARGARET DRIVE CORRECTLY)SO they are in the process of sending me the Software update NOW.IF that doesn't correct the problem, Lireon Support said they would REPLACE the LVW-5005 DVD/RECORDER with the NEWER and Latest version,(LVW-5115 GHC+),I'M STILL WAITING FOR THE SOFTWARE UPDATE, AS OF 01/09/2007 @ 8.06AM-EST!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Thank you very much, Nelson R. Seely, 135 Margaret Drive, Hampton, Virginia, 23669-1809."
2,Picture Quality Lacking,"Bought in April, 2005...This recorder works just as it should, I have recorded several movies and T.V. programs without a hitch. Very easy to use controls.BUT...the resulting picture quality is not great. I hooked up directly from satellite to make sure it was the recorder and it was. It puts these rust colored splotches on any dark backgrounds.Actors with dark hair appear to have rust colored streaks in their hair. It's not bad enough that it is obvious to the casual viewer, but it is always there and i would have to say, i would choose another brand if i could."
1,records dvd's and cd's well........not exactly,well i saw this thing online and since i needed an AUDIO cd recorder for dj gigs and it said it recorded dvd's AND cd's soSTUPID me i bought it and it DOES NOT record audio cd's at all but simply can record video onto audio cd's all in all i would say its one of the stupidest things i have ever done in my life although to be clear it was noones fault but my own not the retailer none the less i now have a perfectly new piece of equipment which is USELESS to me wanna buy it ? drop me a line still in box as new thanks ............knightrider
1,Amazon is WRONG: This unit doesn't have a COMPONENT INPUT!,"I bought this unit because I believed that it had component inputs. It does not. NOTE: This is AMAZON's fault, not Lite-on's!!!When I received the unit, I tried to make it work, but it was defective out of the box. Upon loading a dvd, it makes a grinding noise as it tries to spin up the disc. Usually it never spins it up well enough to actually play the dvd."
1,Disks won't eject after several years,I purchased this unit several years ago and has worked well until recently. I was unable to eject a DVD from the unit. After taking it all apart and taking the top off the DVD player I found that around the spindle there is a pad that has become sticky and every time a DVD is put in the recorder it jams and makes it unable to eject the disk. I have never had a problem with a CD or DVD unit like this. Obviously a bad design.
4,Good,"The book is a good one, however as a beginner i would not recommed it, it lacks details that a beginer will need. Its better suited for someone with more experience."
4,Pleasant chill-out album,"Although I've heard of Morcheeba for a while, I only recently picked up their debut album on what was more or less a whim. As a combination of subdued electronic music and Skye Edwards' deep, soothing voice, Who Can You Trust? works very well. It's not head banging car music, but it's perfect for listening to while sitting at your computer late at night. The songs themselves have just the right mixture of optimism and melancholia. I must admit that the album as a whole is slightly uneven, though. There's a handful of instrumental tracks strewn thoughout that don't make much of an impression on me, and the first half of the album (tracks 1-7) is much stronger than the last. The best song on the album is probably Never an Easy Way, but there are several others that are nearly as good. I'd certainly recommend Who Can You Trust? if you have any sort of interest in this type of music."
3,"Good craftsmanship, still some way to go though","The trouble with Morcheeba is that their sound is not consistent; there are lots of style variations in the album. You get reggae, rock guitar, mellow trip-hop, and other styles as well, all infused with electronic ambiance. The one real link between all the tracks is (vocalist) Skye Edward's voice. But the lyrics don't count for much and, so, despite her best efforts, the album is not much enhanced.There are some good tracks, four in my case; I programed my CD player to play only those. But even so, the sum is less than the individual parts. Why? Because after appeasing my musical senses with its craftsmanship, Morcheeba's music does not add any intelligent thought. For a debut album it is a good effort but may well be forgotten as far as your CD collection is concerned."
3,should have been done later,"i bought ""Big Calm"" before this album and was blown away. morcheeba has mastered the trip-pop sound on that album. my expectations for this album were fairly high considering the fact that i heard that it was more straight forward trip-hop. i've listened to this album several times and while it does have strong songwriting, i don't think morcheeba are good enough of a band to go this experimental on their first album. the comparisons musically and structurally on this compared to ""Big Calm"" are so obvious that in some instances i felt the order of release should have been reversed. there aren't enough singles and catchiness in this one to catch the attention of the listener, especially for a first time out band. i do appreciate the adventurous nature of it, but it just came out a bit to early."
5,Morcheeba: A great band to help deal with modern day living,"I bought ""Who can you trust?"" back in 1997 and ""Big Calm"" last year, and I can't wait to get my hands on more of their brilliant eclectic trippy jazz. Skye has the most soothing voice in the world, which, if possible, could be played out loud for all to hear as if from a hi-fi from heaven, would surely bring about world peace, love and happiness. Morcheeba is the most maxxing and relaxing band around and should be every doctor's prescribed cure to road rage! I dare not even ponder what my life would be without their music which is the core of my saneness!!! Absolutely brilliant, great stuff, go and get it !!:)"
4,A good budget LCD monitor,"The L4AX measures exactly 14.1 inches diagonally, about .2 inches more than a 15"" CRT monitor, so it works best as a replacement for a 15"" CRT. Resolution is standard XGA at 1024x768. I'm never a fan of higher resolution than that so I can live with XGA happily.Mildly stylish, the Kogi seems well built with a sturdy stand. The brightness can't compare with the best from NEC or Sharp, but is adequate in an office or home. Viewing angle is less than more expensive monitors. I don't share my monitor with others so I don't see this as a problem.In real-world usage the monitor performs admirably. The controls are intuitive, and the no-frills design makes it a good value. (Yes, I was attracted to it due to Amazon's good pricing and a generous rebate.)"
2,You can't have something for nuthin' or...,"If it looks to good to be true it probably is. I went with the more positive reviews of this product, but after a disappointing set-up where the monitor flickered on and off and no where to turn to for tech help I put in back in the box and returned it to Amazon.com. It's priced to move no doubt and I thought I could live with a no frills monitor but learn from my experience and put down another hundred bucks and own a monitor you can have more faith in.After droppping the Kogi off at the UPS, I went to Cnet and found the editor's recommendation of the Samsung-SyncMaster 15"" TFT-LCD Flat-Panel Monitor-152N. It's a great monitor, there's plenty of tech support and software (although I haven't needed to use it yet) and a 3-year warranty. As long as you're going to make the investment for a monitor, pay a little extra and get one you can have some confidence in.It was a tough lesson for me to learn but a priceless one."
5,Great buyt for price - Use for checking vehicle battery and continutity in travel trailer,Use it for diagnosing problems of wiring in travel trailer and to check health of truck/auto battery as well as the travel trailer battery.
3,Just What I Need,"I bought a ton of 3W candelabra based flourescent bulbs on eBay. Although there are streetlights nearby, my front porch is still a little dark and this makes a reasonable night light without being gaudy or obtrusive. As for the bulb installation, I'm used to tight spaces in computers, plumbing & electrial."
1,Stunning disaster,"In my mind this is an attempt to be Ian Curtis for a day, an obsessed JD fan (and there are, were, and probably always will be obsessed fans) finally having his childhood dream come true, kind of strange, kind of sad. Why do I say this? These songs are instrumentally so close to the originals so therefore are either a weak, poor copy or a failed attempt at interpretation. Many people have attempted (some more successful than others) to cover JD songs, and most have interpreted the songs by forming them into their own idea, this is not the case here by a long shot. Compared to the versions offered by SWANS, Codeine, Galaxy 500 or Roy Montgomery, this CD is nothing more than an embarrassment. Why listen to this when you can hear the real thing???"
1,You've lost the plot dude......,I used to be a good friend of Russ Pay - I hope he reads this review. Sort your (...) life out mate. You used to be a great musician and an inspiration to all that played with you. This is just a pile of toss. All I can say is that the money must have been good - or that George is feeding you too many narcotics. Sorry mate - it's (horrible) - however you probably already know that...
1,"Ewww, why don't they just give Bjorn Again their own CD to?","Why? Why bother? Who is Russ Pay and who cares? He did the whole album. Just one guy. I don't think he's ever done anything else. Like, if you had a ""Tribute to Elvis"" CD, you'd expect it to be various other artists interpreting his music in an original way - not just one Elvis impersonator for the whole thing!It seems pretty obvious that the only reason he did this CD was so he's dopey name would show up in all future JD discographies. Listen to the samples here... this moron ruins all of these great songs by slightly reworking them so they sound like straight modern-rock-radio mediocre clutter. For such an original band it seems like the most inane tribute you could give. It's Joy Division: pub rock style."
4,Very good book,My son loves the story and it is even OK for adults to read over and over and over. Also a good intro reader for my son.
2,Cobweb Queen not great,"While my son and I loved the Pirate Ghost tale, we were disapointed when we got this one. The story is fairly openended, leaving you with an empty feeling but what bugged me most was the male bashing and slant that way. Otto's niece Olivia comes to visit and starts right in on him with insults like ""You're a detective?"" She always wins the arguements, she saves the day and the story is generally slanted toward making her look good and the boys bad. There were also lots of ""stupid"" and ""dumb"" references toward other characters in the book- the world has too many harsh words as it is. Not needed in a kid's bedtime story."
1,Not worth it,"I consider myself an intermidate web designer who likes to hand code pages.I took a chance purchasing this cd-rom and paid the price. The information was shallow and uninformative. It provided no insight into HTML elements, only simple examples. Experienced users would find it useless. Novices will find it confusing. Save you money and time, get a real reference."
4,bahama,I love the shirt. It is cool in this hot and humid climate. The one fault I have discovered is the breast pockets are too large and are always billowed out. Other than this the shirt is great.
1,enviaron una franela US Polo Assn de dama,"enviaron ropa equivocada, mi correo es ciroguadagno@hotmail.com, les agradezco me envien la camisa Columbia por la cual ya pague lo antes posible, me siento estafado, sean responsables."
4,A little too big,"The shirt is really nice and the fabric great, but the size is bigger than usual, so if you're gonna buy one, I would say that you should buy a size smaller that you usually use."
3,The Cologne Had No Smell,I had purchased Kouros Sport several times in the past. I like its smell. This time there was no smell. It's like all of the right ingrediants are there but they left out what makes it smell so good. What I purchased does not have any smell to it.
4,Fabulous Drag,"This is a fabulous book. It has some of the prettiest queens I have even seen. They have style and attitude, and everything the best queens are made of. Highly recommended"
4,Fulfills its purpose,"I'm still working through this one, but if you are a VB developer who needs to both get up to speed on OO concepts and understand migration issues, get this book. Just enough code to explain the concepts, so if you are looking for example code buy a different book. If you want to understand the changes, reasons for the changes and just learn to be a better developer and architect of solutions, this is well worth your time."
2,Oh-No!!! Another bad book from Dan,"This is the second Dan Appleman book that I have reviewed (the other being ""Developing Com/Activex Components With Visual Basic 6""). In both books, Dan starts to tell you about something and then he goes off on some tangent and starts talking about something else. Maybe he will get back to the original subject. This is like debugging spaghetti code, only this is Dan's writing style. It is very hard to follow and very frustrating. Not all of Dan's books are like this. I did not buy this book and when a friend asked me to review it, I was a little leary. Dan's book about API is very good. I was hoping for better from Dan. Too much talk. Remember Dan, Keep It Simple!!!"
4,Prince O3,"I was ahppy with my purchase, although the price difference to a cheaper racquet didn't help me on my game. I was able to control better a previous cheaper prince racquet."
1,Horrible - You will just waste your money,"The Bad: Extremely difficult to get the top plastic bean holder on properly. Even more difficult after cleaning. And speaking of cleaning - that is quite a messy process. It retains a significant amount of ground coffee under the upper grinder. No easy way to get that out. Either attempt to push down the slot or tip the grinder on it's side and brush out. I used a can of compressed air to help get it clean and that was an interesting mess. Bottom line is if you do not clean it the left over coffee will negatively impact your fresh ground coffee. And once you clean it good luck getting the plastic bean holder back on. For me, a HUGE WASTE of money and unfortunately the original box is gone. Hate it when I do something stupid like this.The Good: Assuming you can get the top on it grinds as advertised. But a poor design!"
3,Not impressed,"After reading the reviews my expectations were very high. After using it for a couple weeks, I probably should have spent more for a better grinder. I like the coffee ground very fine, which the capresso does, however at the finer grind it clogs under the rotating burr mechanism. This makes coffee making somewhat a chore. It would be really nice to just put the beans in and hit the switch. Maybe the next grinder will do that."
2,"Disappointed with the reproductions, also","I, like the previous reviewer, saw the exhibit recently and was enamored with Sargent's work! Imagine my dissapointment after getting the book home and not seeing the ""same"" paintings as I had on the exhibit hall wall. Sargent's use of light is phenomenal and his life sized paintings and murals lose so much in the reproductions. Skip the book and go see the exhibit. It will be one that sticks with you for a long time to come, as it will with me."
5,WWE King Of THe Ring 1993!,"This is Mudd. I will be reviewing 1993-1998 under this PPV so keep reading.PPV Name-King of the Ring 1993Date-6/3/93Buyrate-1.1Attendance-6,500City-Dayton, OhioArena-Nutter CenterYokozuna defeated Hulk Hogan to win the World TitleShawn Michaels defeated Crush to keep the IC TitleThe Smoking Gunns and Steiner Brothers defeated Headshinkers and Money Inc.Papa Shango defeated Owen Hart{First Round:}Bret Hart defeated Razor RamonMr. Perfect defeated Mr. Hughes by DQBam Bam Bigelow defeated Jim DugganLex Luger and Tatanka fought to a 15 minute time limit draw{Second Round:}Bret Hart defeated Mr. PerfectBam Bam Bigelow got a bye{Finals:}Bret Hart defeated Bam Bam Bigelow to become King of the Ring 1993"
2,Hell in a Cell,"The 1 star for this match is Austin vs. Kane. The rest of this PPV is (...). Worst King of the Ring a ""King"" talking to a manican head. 300 pound human falls 15 feet twice gets a star too. Don't buy this unless you have all other WWF, WCW, ECW, FMW, ect. PPV's"
3,WELL............,"It was a good ppv, but i saw smebody write it was one of the top 3 ppv's ever? somebody who obviously know nothing about wrestling know's absolutly nothing about it. outside of the great cage match, and the average mainevent................ not worth buying at all and wm 14 was much better."
4,King Of The Ring 1998 review,"The only thing memberable about this PPV is the HITC match between Mankind & The Undertaker which was a bloody,hardcore,hard-hitting,ruthless match of the night. The rest while not bad matches are pretty forgettable at best. I give this show a 7 out of 10."
2,Mushy sardines look better than they are.,"I just ate a can of these for breakfast. They look great, but the best I can describe the aroma of the can is ""musty"". Thanks to modern canning technology, my senses can scream ""don't eat this!"" and I can eat it anyway with no ill effects.When I tried these sardines, it seemed to me that the tomato sauce and seasoning was protecting me from a really bad experience of just eating the mushy, musty fish. But I needed more protection, so I microwaved them for 15 seconds (helps any sardine) and put a lot of sea salt on them, and I got the whole can down.I only give one star reviews to sardines when I can't finish the can, so these get two stars. And that said, there may be people out there who have different tasts and actually like these, and they are typicall priced lower than many other brands.So, please give these a try by buying one can at a store before you commit to buying in bulk."
3,OK for a change,"I eat them mashed on buttered toast with fresh black pepper. These are medium/large fish, 4 per tin with skin and backbones, not very tightly packed. The flesh on these guys was a bit grey and very tender, bordering on mushy. Maybe because these are fattier cold-water Canadian fish? The loose packing left room for lots tomato sauce. I would've preferred another medium fish instead of the extra sauce. The basil comes as black flecks in the sauce. You can't really complain about random chunks of stuff in a tin of sardines, but the black basil flakes made me pause and think for a second. Salting is mild with the tomato and basil flavor really coming through, dominating the taste of the fish. Overall, these were good for a change from plain or tomato-only fish, but not something I'd want to commit to in bulk."
1,MP3 FM Transmitter,"Item not as pictured... unless they sent me the wrong item. Invoice clearly states Car FM transmitter USB charger adaptor for IPOD/PDA/MP3, but item DOES NOT work with IPOD, as it does not come with the right IPOD connector as pictured. I'm returning it for credit."
5,Harsh title--but it's solid advice,"This book was recommended to me by a marriage counselor. I have yet to read its equal when it comes to understanding what is involved in cultivating a loving, mutually beneficial committed relationship. I went thru a divorce after 25 yrs. ofmarriage and wish I had had access to this book before I met my husband. So many pitfalls could have been avoided. Eyes wide open; see things for what they are--not what you hope they will be--put some distance between the two of you so you can gain perspective--take plenty of time to get to really know eachother....don't rush!"
2,Great Book good condition,"This is a good book, It took forever to receive it but it did come in the condition that the seller said it would."
4,a fascinating journey,"What a wonderful book! The exchange of letters is nothing less than fascinating. By reading these letters not only does one get a sense of the racial and economic divisions between the writers, but a glimpse is gained into what would be a peculiar exchange of correspondence even now: a seventy-something woman of well-intentioned but often misguided motives and a teenaged girl perplexed with all the rampant emotions and self-absorbtions of her age.I cannot stress how inportant I feel it is to read the introduction by Shula Marks AFTER reading the letter exchange. Anyone who has even a fundamental knowledge of South Africa during this time would do better not to read the intro first. It's better to get caught up in the flow of the letters and let their story unfold unadulterated. There is an almost voyeuristic aspect to them as they come to their conclusion. I highly recommend this book--and not only to those with an interest in South Africa or Womens' History."
5,pivotal,"When I suffered from debilitating depression after the birth of my 2nd daughter, I searched everywhere for something to grasp onto. Anything to grasp onto. Somehow I found this book. All of a sudden, here was someone like me - someone else who wanted to drive off a bridge. I felt like I had finally made a connection and I wasn't alone in this anymore.I can honestly say that this book was pivotal in my (LONG) recovery. It is what ultimately encouraged me to push through, connect with others and reclaim motherhood. Marrit's accounts of early motherhood are real, moving, poignant, and honest. I highly recommend this book to any new mother - if you aren't suffering from PPD yourself, you might be able to understand and reach out to someone who is."
2,doesn't last long,"After 4 years, it no longer plays dvd's. one day i watched a dvd, the next day, i get a ""no disc"" error no matter which slide i put it in, and haven't been able to get it to work since then."
1,DO NOT BUY FOR GUINEA PIGS,THIS IS NOT FOR GUINEA PIGS. it hurts them and it will be hurt for a long time so it is important u do not but this for guinea pigs. its great for other pets but NOT FOR GUINEA PIGGIES
1,NOT FOR GUINEA PIGS!,"Agreed- Amazon should not be marketing this for Guineas. I don't care what the packaging says, it is being marketed to the wrong owners who may not know any better."
1,Not for Guinea Pigs,"I wanted to add to the negative reviews because this product is marketed for guinea pigs and can do serious damage to their spines. Do not use this for guinea pigs.Just as a side note, if you have a guinea pig, probably 90% of what you were told in the pet store is inaccurate. Guinea pigs are exotic pets and need different care than other rodents. Google cubes and coroplast, or cavy cages your cavy, at home for better info on how to make sure your piggies get the exercise they need. In response to a previous review, yes, guinea pigs are on the list of recommended pets on the product box (bottom left in above photo)."
1,Horribly misleading name!,"This ""guinea pig run"" should never have a guinea pig in it. They will hurt themselves and be terrified. As to the product description alleging you can use it as a guinea pig ""pet carrier,"" I can only assume that the people writing the description think people are idiots. Your pig will be scared and could hurt themselves in that little ball. Get a real carrier and never try to ""give your pig a chance to exercise freely"" in these balls. Really the name and description should just be changed to rat or chinchilla holder."
1,Use With Caution (for chinchillas),"I do not recommend this product for chinchillas. The main reason being is that within the ball, the temperature and humidity rise very quickly, causing deadly conditions for your chinchilla. Chinchillas also tend to urinate while inside the ball, which increases the humidity even more. The chinchilla can easily have a heat stroke and die within minutes of playing in this ball. If anyone were to use this toy for their chinchilla, I hope that playtime would be monitored and limited to a VERY short time, especially if weather conditions are already hot and/or humid. For the sake of your pet chinchilla, USE WITH CAUTION."
1,no need to use for a guinea pig,"In addition to potentially causing physical, permanent harm to your guinea pig, I see no reason for this kind of product unless you easily confuse guinea pigs with hamsters.Guinea pigs are much larger and will enjoy their playtime more if they can roam freely.If you are wanting to buy this kind of product, you are obviously more concerned with entertaining yourself rather than being a responsible guinea pig owner."
1,Manufacturer needs to re-label this product,"As many others have already said in their reviews of this product on Amazon.com and elsewhere, the Giant Run-About Exercise Ball is inappropriate for guinea pigs. Despite concerns by guinea pig owners, though, Super Pet continues to market the product on their website as follows: ""13 inch diameter is ideal for pet rats, guinea pigs, chinchillas or other small animals. It makes a great roly-poly toy for ferrets and a neat pet carrier for guinea pigs.""Pet owners may wish to contact the manufacturer and ask that the 'Giant Exercise Ball' be re-labeled to exclude guinea pigs from the product description and advertising: customerservice@superpet.net"
1,worst investment i ever made,I bought this wall about 2-weeks ago I paid $45.00. It nerve would hold the air in the wall part and the store would not take it back . Dose anyone know the manufactor of this sorry excuse for a toy it said on the box rates # one . yeah rightIt was just a ploy to get you to buy it.
1,Durability is non-existant,"Inflated this product using the pump supplied by the manufacturer. Within 3 days, a seam developed a 6 inch tear. Four of the climbimg handles also developed torn seams. The product is rated for 4 children. My 35 pound 4 year old was the only user. I recommend finding another product. This one is definitely not worth $100."
3,1984,"Another fine mid 80s P-MODEL album, not as techno as their later releases but interesting as usual."
3,Not what you think,"this book is not what i expected, but the more you look at it the better it gets.I love Korine's work in films and am in the process of getting A Crackup at the Race Riots, but this book seems more like a series of ink blots leaving you to make what you want of the pictures in front of you. Overall it's an alright book but it's not up to par with Korine's films."
1,Pass on this one..,"I liked Crackup and his films, but this book is not that good. The photos are just crappy and the layout of the book is as well. I don't know what they were going for, but they missed the mark. I was disappointed."
4,I guess you had to be there...,"I got this book for myself and for a co-worker. I thought it was hilarious; however, when I gave it to my co-worker, she was taken back. Personally, I think it's a cute 'addition' to your baby's memorabilia. If you buy it as a gift for someone, make sure they will appreciate the humor in it or you might get a blank stare."
5,"FINALLY, A GREAT BABY BOOK FOR PARENTS!!!","The INAPPROPRIATE BABY BOOK is clever, funny, and filled with wonderful illustrations.Ms. Stinson has created a baby book that's made especially for parents -- and for their kids to appreciate as they get older. You'll want to write down all of your baby's ""gross and embarrassing memories"", like 'Your first poop happened on this day:' (fill in the page), or 'The first person you spit up on was:' (fill in the page). And your kids, when they're old enough, will love you for it.A great gift idea and keepsake. Brilliant!"
5,Funny,I gave this book to my brother and sister in law for Christmas and as they read it everyone was laughing. I can't wait to fill it in.
1,Not worth it!,Waste of money. This book is thinner than most childrens picture books. Very cheap and really not that funny.
1,Pure garbage from a vindictive man.,"As would be expected, a man writing about women when he knows nothing about the subject. And a lot of uneducated men believe him. I can't believe that men can be stupid enough to read this garbage. I'm ashamed to call myself male."
3,Chef's choice,"Lightweight and easy to store. I leave it on the workbench. It is fine for smaller kitchen knives/pocket knives. A larger, heavier product is preferable for larger knives. It is worth its price and is made in the USA."
3,"Not great for blues, ok for folk tunes","If you want to grab your harp and blast a few blues riffs with the guys on guitar, this is not the book for you. This is a slim volume, meant to go in your pocket along camping trips or get-togethers if you don't play by ear. It has folk tunes everyone knows, like Tom Dooley and other straight-harp favorites.There is a nod to blues playing by explaining the 12-bar blues, but really, this is a small straight harp cheat-book."
2,Not bad for the money,The songs in this book are mostly in 1st position-so if you are looking for great blues lick-this is probably the wrong place to look. However this isn't a bad compilation of popular songs aranged for the harmonica
3,I LOVE Hillsong...but,"This one is a little weak. I have several other CDs from Hillsong that I have played countless times. It sounds like Blessed, but it lacks the sincerity and intesity of Blessed. It's worth buying, but I'd buy the other CDs first.To the drummer: Lighten up on playing the crash like a ride. It sounds great in moderation, but it's too much on this CD.Fellow Drummer"
4,Excellent material for new Skippers!,This book will help the rookie sailor to know the ways around the ship from knots to sails and from Bow to Stern. It will become a usefull companion for references on maneouvres and on-ship safety measures.Very recommended.
4,do not purchase this toy,"This would be a terrific toy for a variety of ages of children if it were durable. We bought one for our two young children who weigh approximately 35 pounds each. We kept it inside, on the carpet, and the kids took their shoes off to climb on it. It lasted about 10 days before getting a hole. We patched the hole and then about 4 or 5 more holes developed. It is very difficult to find the leaks and after about 3 weeks we had to throw it away - what a waste. I was very frustrated at having spent the money on it - many other reviewers, I notice, are having the same trouble."
5,Fluid,"A real fluid CD to listen to. Juno Reactor is a after midnight kind of band with music that helps you go into yourself. Whether your dancing with a group of people or comtemplating the thoughts in your mind at home, Juno Reactor will help loosen up your mind and take you to an electronic realm.Peace."
4,Text and photos,"If you are interested in Trinidadian birds this is a good purchase. The plates are not very good (the author wanted new plates for the new edition) but the text, with descriptions and distributions is very helpful.I read this, and looked at the pictures in Hilty's ""Birds of Venezuela"""
2,Guide to Birds of T/T by R. Ffrench,"I took this book to T/T on a bird watching trip and found it mildly useful. I am not a professional birder, so take that into account. The colors in the plates are not very true in many cases and the separation of plates from descriptive info is not helpful. Compared to such books as The Sibley Field Guide to Birds of Eastern North America it is a not very useful. Apparently not much else is available."
3,"Comfy, but the sound is mediocre; broke after 3.5 months","Pros:- Comfortable- Long cable- Comes with a 1/4"" adapter- Doesn't look bad- Build quality seems pretty good for the price- Sound doesn't leak at sensible volumesCons:- Sound is mediocre (lows are almost completely missing)I think that the single con outweighs the pros. If the sound was improved a bit, these would be killer headphones for the price. I'll keep them and use them to listen to music at work, but next time I will be purchasing something else.EDIT: After three and a half months, they no longer function. I am getting no sound out of either side. The cord has not been tampered with, as it was plugged into my work computer and has never been rolled over by a chair."
3,"Sorta clunky, Sorta murky","These headphones are ok, nothing amazing, but what do you expect for the price. The lower mid-range doesn't have any depth or clarity. The only way I can describe it is, it's as if these frequencies are being transmitted through a thin piece of cardboard. It doesn't sound good. Not terrible, but not good.Another thing : they're pretty clunky. Not super heavy or horribly uncomfortable, but pretty big and awkward. They're good for when you're in the mood to be a bug person with a huge bug head on a thin bug neck.These aren't the most awful headphones around, but I'll bet there are plenty of better choices even in this price range."
1,Would be nice if they check whether it works at least,"we received sealed package in a normal conditions without damage, it looks normal but works only one side, if you have problem with one ear than it's a good product,"
5,great sound,this headphone is great.....real good sound and the comfort is great.....fits real good on my big head and fits just as good on my kids head....the whole family loves these
1,It won't cover the whole ear.,It won't cover the whole ear. It is good for kids with small ears. It hurts my ears after one hour. The sound is OK.
5,exceptionally good for its price!,"so, I bought these as a replacement for my broken ipod earphones... they are really good for the price... after listening for a while the sound quality gets better. The only concern I have is that it's quite large and they literally look like earmuffs in the winter... but I can live with that"
2,THE TRIUMPH OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ( 1935 ),"I FAIL TO SEE THE BUSINESS SENSE BEHIND NOT RESTORING ALL OF THE ARTHUR WORTNER SHERLOCK HOLMES MOVIES , THERE ARE SO MANY SHERLOCKIANS LIKE ME OUT THERE THAT WOULD BUY ANY OF THE OLD SHERLOCK HOLMES MOVIES THAT YOU WOULD RESTORE BY ARTHUR WORTNER AND ANY OTHER ACTORS WHO PLAYED THE GREAT MAN , THERE IS A HUGE MARKET OUT THERE FOR THESE MOVIES IF YOU WOULD ONLY RESTORE THEM IN PICTURE AND SOUND , i WATCHED AN OLD BUSTER KEATON SILENT SHERLOCK HOLMES MOVIE ON NETFLIX THE OTHER DAY , IT WAS SHOT IN 1925 , AND THE PICTURE WAS SHARP AND CRYSTAL CLEAR , AS IF IT HAD JUST BEEN SHOT! , AND YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU CAN'T RESTORE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MOVIES SHOT IN THE 1930'S , ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS WE WANT THEM RESTORED , THE MARKET IS THERE , WHERE ARE THE SUPPLIERS ? wILLIAM CROCE"
4,A Walk Down Memory Lane (Hope Street),"I was born on Hope Street and lived in Springdale for most of mylife. Al Michaud brings back many wonderful memories of growingup. ""A Twig Grows in Springdale"" is a good read for anyone whogrew up in a small town or wished that they did.You get the feeling that we were richer then, with or withoutCon Lund's dimes.Thanks for the memories! Al.Marilyn Seaman Ritchie"
1,Borarama,"Good graphics boring game.There is only 1 way to describe this game ""BORING"" my advice stay as far away as possible from it."
5,Mirra 2,"This game is far better than the previous version, in my opinion. One of my favorite features is the way you can modify tricks... instead of stringing a backflip with an x-up, you can do a backflip x-up. The possibilitiies are endless. I also think this game is better than Tony Hawk 2 and Mat Hoffman. Tons of fun."
2,Greasy but dry and hard.,"I expected something like a healthy version of potato chips or packaged garlic bread, or flavored corn chips where you don't need dipping. I was wrong. It's too thick and ended up being hard rather than crunchy. Greasy and lacking flavor. I tried one bag alone and one with avacado, disappointed both times. Two stars for the natural ingredients."
3,One of the rare guides about this fascinating country,"I found this book about Albania in a french book-store. The book contains a lot of information about Albanian history, art and architecture which fills half of the book. The other half of the book is the tourism part with descriptions of Albanian towns, churches and ruins. There are a lot of beautiful photographs in this book. This book only describes Albania in a historical and architectural way. Unfortunately you will not find a lot of information about current social circumstances, economy, transportation possibilities, hotels, restaurants, customs and all the other things about practical life. There is just one page covering this, but it is outdated information."
5,Du-Ha is great!,This is a great product to add style and extra storage in a pickup. Worth the money. Easy to install.
5,Great Buy.,This purchase was a bargin and will be used by me for years to come. It appears to be brand new.
4,Lasagna Gardening,This opened my eyes of gardening.Be green and you will benefit from all the waste that is thrown away. MY NEW GREEN THUMB
5,Lasagna Gardening,Ordered this book as a gift because the receiver truly enjoyed reading our copy. Excellent.
1,Negative stars for this piece of junk!!!,"About 6 months after buying the S450, I started getting paper jams from hell. I called Customer Service and they replaced it with a refurbished model. 4 months later the same problem has surfaced. It wastes ink like crazy and the so called economical ink tanks cost a fortune since I was reprinting pages because of the very frequent paper jams. I never had this problem with my HP Deskjet which I owned for 4-5 years!!!"
4,must have for the PPL student,"This is an excellent textbook to have accompany you through studies for the private pilot certificate.Everything is well explained and backed up with very good pictures and diagrams.It isn't cheap, but then again neither is flying. However I can guarantee that if you purchase this then you'll understand that you made a good decision soon after opening it."
2,"OK, not worth the money","I bought this as I was starting my private, but I never even referred to it as I was studying for the written, and it gathers dust on my bookshelf today. I refer now to my FAA pilot's handbook and FAA instrument flying handbook instead.It's like many of the Jepp products: they cost a lot, and there are equivalent--or better--resources available for much lower cost, often for free."
2,Extremely complicated for a beginner!,"In preparation to remodel our master bathroom, I thought it would be fun and interesting to find a software package that was simple but effecient. I was expecting this program to possibly ask for a few measurements and then piece my project together for me. Sadly, I was very wrong.It offers above and beyond what I need. The software itself seems fabulous if you know how to use it right away, but unless you have experience with this type of program, or you are highly motivated to delve into the 200 plus page manual that comes with it, my suggestion would be to look for something a lot less technical.Honestly, I'm just finishing up my fourth hour on it and I still haven't gotten anywhere.... except to Amazon.com, looking for a different program."
3,did not fit,"The fence is well made and appears to be a quality product.Unfortunately, it did NOT fit my older model table saw although the rep at Delta indicated it would.To make the support rails fit, I would need to drill several holes in the angle iron.Decided not to do this, void warranty, and returned the fence.Make sure it will fit your model saw!"
2,Okay,"The book is too jumbled with tech jargon. While it has some relevance and pretty good info that could and should be used by most senior execs of big corporations, it repeats itself too much and is too laden with tech talk that not all people can understand. However, if you know tech already, this is a good book.I'd recommend reading the intro and the conclusion and skip the middle."
3,Not As I Expected,"I know..I know...many FF Fans will curse me for this. But I was quite disappointed with FFX. The plot was beautiful and the graphics was awesome. But I miss my duelling cards...which disappeared from FFX and didn't like Blitzball at all, in fact, I only played it once...so that i can move further into the game. The sphere Grid was a a blast. I loved it.This is the first time i could beat the final boss without any problems nor with the help of the guide book...which, by the way, I ordered a month ago but not shipped yet.Why i didn't like it as much...?well, its just a bit too easy.Oh..and the equipments are a bit disappointing as well.. i love having many equipments. Guess what ? In this game..you use minimal equipments which kills all the fun. P.S: Tidus is such a crybaby!!!"
1,Lcpl Blacks opinion,Personally I was dissatisfied with the purchase of this game.There is a severe lack of a solid storyline.And there was great deficiency in character connection. I am a Marine and we act nothing like Dennis Riley. The graphics were acceptable but as I previously stated their are good games and their are great games and a solid storyline and character connection separate good games and great games.There could have been a better selection of weapons as well.If you are looking for action that wont put you to sleep like pointless alien killing games will then spend your money elsewhere.Try Socom or Hitman 2. they kick more a-- than extermination does.
4,Resident Evil wannabe!,"This game is pretty good when you get into it a ways, but in the end, you are gonna end up going back to the good old Resident Evil games. The setting isn't as spooky as an abandoned police station and the little mutant bug things aren't as freaky as zombies, but this games is a nice change from RE. The graphics are good, as is the sound, and the story is a little more convincing than the REs or Silent Hill. I have beaten this game, and the ending is only so-so and by the way, there is no replay value. The only plus is that you can start a new game with a bunch of weapons and meds, that's it! And all of the cut-scenes are mediocre, with the characters' lips still moving long after they are done talking, and the annoying subtitles are like 4 sentences behind. ..."
1,OMG what was I THINKING!,"I will start by saying this game shamelessly milks the R.E. and Dino Crisis fans financially, first, the script and dialogue is horrible, the graphics engine is even worse, to me this was graphics from a PS-One database, you would literally have to be drunk not to notice this, and finally, the concept of having to go back and forth and backtrack for things will eventually give you a migrane, anything from R.E. anthology wasn't this bad, I hate to slam this game but I have to be honest of my opinion of it, I'm just greatful I rented it first, and I feel sorry for those that have...."
2,"So much potential, so little effort.","This game could have been huge, except the lack of real effort is obvious. The sound leaves much to be desired. I don't mean the voices don't match up with the movements of the characters either. The background sounds are off too, you'll hear something happen first, then a few seconds later you'll see it happen. The controls are next to worthless. How many times has a jump been foiled when either the game didn't respond to the jump button, or when a failure to set the camera angle to a favorable position set me flying off into oblivion.The game also suffers from poor planning; what to do next isn't always obvious to the player. You'll be prompted to head to a certain area or do a task, but before you can you must find a piece of equipment to get there. The game fails to bring that information to the player's attention, and therefore the player is left to wander about, until he or she happens upon the neccesary equipment."
2,You get what you pay for.,You get what you pay for these things are very flimsy and are constantly coming unbuckled. If you want some cheap suspenders that are going to constantly come unbuckled these are for you!
4,Well organized book outlining key aspects of a MLM company,"The book covers all the aspects of organizing a successful network marketing company. Especially valuable, was the recommendation to get an experienced ""rain-maker"" to head up the sales side of the business. I have two criticisms of the book. First, the book seems to target the needs of a MLM company transitioning from a start-up to a mid-sized company. I would have liked to have seen more information on how a start-up could manage to provide the services a more established MLM company offers without hiring a boatload of people. Second, several of the books chapters contained articles that I had already downloaded off the web."
5,Book--- Green Thursday,"The book is somewhat dark, but so was the life of the blacks depicted in the story. It gives a good feel for the day to day lives of poor black southerners in the South Carolina lowcountry, including their culture and their language."
2,So-So,"OK. I love 98 degrees. But false info is a major no-no. The facts didn't come from the guys and that's fine if you just want to know a little about the band. Avid 98 fans like myself will only purchase this book for the pictures, for it's too frustrating to read."
2,Another book to read about 98 degrees!,"This is another book about this great band 98 degrees! This book is ok, some the of the facts are wrong and you can tell by reading some of the items she talks about. First the song, Do you wanna dance is sung in the first verse by Drew not Jeff. If she went to one of their concerts she would know!! This book is ok if you want to know somethings about 98 degrees, but 98 degrees will be having their own book out in September of this year! As a fan of 98 degrees I read everything, but 98 degrees says that we shouldn't read everything people print and to wait for the real thing!!"
5,Awesome Talent!,"This collection of poetry and prose is entertaining and enlightening. To delve into the mind of a man on aspects such as Love and God is refreshing. Selected favorites such as Sunrise, which shows that the simplicity of words can be enough and Petals Against My Skin that make vulnerability appealing is reason enough to add this to your collection. Women everywhere need to See Through Eyes and get this book. Better yet...men...make the jesture and get your woman a copy!"
1,Find something better,"While this book helped to review the topics for the AP Physics examination, the explanations were non-existant. The practice tests were very similar to the real questions on the test, however, in the answer key, the explanations made no sense, not telling you which equations to use, or why. I would recommend the Princeton Review Physics study guide over this one any day. There are a lot better review guides available than this one, I could have done better on the exam having only used the textbook."
1,please remove my name,"Since I contributed to the first edition, the book has been edited to the point of incorrectness. Case in point: It now says incorrectly that aiplane lift can be explained using Bernoulli's principle."
3,FTCE Elementary Education K-6 Test Prep Review,"As it turns out, not much of what I studied with this book appeared on the exam. It was very disheartening, for I studied day and nights for weeks with this book. The idea of the book was great, especially with the CD, but it needs to be updated!! I didn't pass the exam, so that should tell you it isn't worth the money until they update their data."
1,Was NO help.,"I read and studied this book until I knew all info contained inside. I took both tests provided in book and scored A's on them. Took the FTCE this past weekend and not one subject area or test question was the same, totally waste of money and time. I understand that the tests are new and the information may have changed either way the current book is no good!!! Don't waste your money. An education major sat next to me and say to go to the library and check out textbooks because the so called study guides aren't made by the people who make the tests. I also understand there is a textbook that has a white cover that is good, I am still searching because in 60 days I plan to retake the test because I already feel I failed, very disappointed in book and cost!!!"
2,Hope I can help others,I bought this book knowing that it probably wasn't going to help much. I knew that none of the review books were really going to help. The test is based on your overall rounded knowledge of everything. I used many resources and this was just one of them. There is no quick fix for this test. I wish there was. I used this book to add to the information I already had. Good luck to you all taking the test. It's rough! Study everything that you can.
1,This book was not helpful at all,"I feel this book was a waste of my money and time. The Subject area test here in Florida it is not consistant with any of the million guides that are flowing around. I did not pass the test and I can't find one that can come close to the test.Anyhow, this book did not help me AT ALL so do not bother buying it. It will be a waste of time."
2,Are you smarter than a 5th grader?,"This book was helpful in the fact that it covered all of the competencies on the FTCE, but there was ALOT of content from the book never mentioned on the exam. The questions on the practice test were very complex and not at all like the format of actual exam questions. LOTS of typographical errors. I studied this book for 5 weeks and it honestly was not as much help as I would have liked. But...for someone like me who has been out of school for several years it was a good refresher for basics. I did pass.:)"
2,Dead after 4 days...,"Overall a good piece, superb sound quality... however, stopped working on my way to school, no idea why and can't boot it anymore... Maybe just my bad luck, but I did enjoy it for the 4 days..."
1,Waste of Money,I bought this for my mother for Mother's Day. Shipping was fast but bracelet was cheap with plastic like clasp!! PLASTIC! I was embarassed to say the least. I don't think pictures match real products. Hopefully we will be able to get our money back.
1,Disappointed,"My almost 3 y.o. dd loves Dora. I thought this toy would be great for her so I got it for her. I am very disappointed. The biggest problem is that she wants to wear it as a backpack and it is NOT a backpack. I had to tie straps to it so that she can wear it. The toys inside are cheaply made. She does play with the plastic map once in a while, but that is it. Everything else is ignored. I wish I had saved my money on this one."

5,matching necklace,my sister had got my mother the necklace a few years ago. now she has the matching set and loves it
2,swat sniper wantabe,its a nice looking gun but thats all. It dont shoot right and the battery dies fast. I charged it for 4 hrs the next day i went to shoot it and the battery was dead. all and all if you want a gun that looks good thats what this gun is good for.
1,I'm not an expert but...,Stern's Scottish accent is one of the worst I've ever heard. Perhaps his approach is sound but I don't want to sound like him and that destroys my motivation. Better to get some old Scottish radio broadcasts and copy a real accent.
2,"great performance,annoying video.","First of all the bands performance is excellent, Traffic has never sounded better.The major complain't I have is 1st of all, my copy is MONO,not stereo like it's suppose to be. The stereo only comes in on Gimme some lovin' I'm surprised no one else has mentioned it.Secondly,like other reviewers I'd like to see the band performing this great material not the useless images of buildings, trucks, people playing hockey or whatever,members of the band watching some auction tv show.Too much editing,too much artistic nonsense for me."
4,High speed 7 port hub,"I purchased a laptop with not really enough USB ports so went looking for a hub. I tried the CyberPower High-Speed 7 Port USB Hub. Never figured I would ever need that many ports. Incidently I am using more than half of the ports all the time. (when you have them you use them). I like that it is powered makes a great charger for my phone, also runs my laptop cooler(i7). Compact, ready to go out of the box, neat light and simple. Needs a little more base with it being so handy to use it has a tendancy to get loaded up. Excellent buy and works as advertised!"
1,Garbage,I bought one of these and it died within 2 months. Worked fine and then just quit. Don't waste your money.
2,Spotty,Works intermittently. Sometimes my devices just disappear from my cpu. I use this with a Mac.
4,Beware --incuded power adapter is NOT 220-240V compatible,"Bought this hub for primarily overseas use. Typically what I find overseas is junk, and like other reviewers, I have tried just about everything out there and ended up returning them one and all.Several of the reviews said an overseas capable power adapter (100-240V) came with the unit. That is evidently no longer the case as the unit I received (June 2010) arrived with an adapter rated at 100-120V (input) and 5V 3.6A (output). Apparently Cyberpower no longer supplies higher voltage capable power adapters with this unit. To get full simultaneous use from all the ports from a 220-240V source, you would either need to get an appropriate universal power adapter which can operate from 220-240 or a step-down transformer.From their website, Cyberpower does not appear to offer a model of this hub with a 100-240V adapter."
5,Great product! Works great with all my USB devices,"So far it's been working great with my all my USb devices including external hard drives, flash drives, ipod, phones, microphones, etc."
4,Multi-USB,"I like all the plugs, but it does not stand up. Cord management is a nightmare when everything is plugged in...but part of that is just me needing to find a better place than on my desk to keep the thing."
4,"Could be cheaper, but...","I already have 3 of their larger sized USB Hubs. What I needed was a AC powered port. PC's sometimes under power ports, when it comes to medical equipment, that is a very bad thing (X-rays, cameras). The cable length (I think it was 36 inches) was just long enough to go from table top down to the computer. The other advantage besides power is a hub lets you beat to death the hub usb connection without damaging the the motherboard based USB connection. I am happy with the 2 units I purchased. They are up and running in a dental office. I would prefer to pay less, but I wanted something I could trust."
1,Will you still give it 5 stars when it shorts out all your devices?,"I got this product and a wireless keyboard. Plugin new wireless keyboard to usb device. wireless keyboard doesnt work. Plug old keyboard into device. Old keyboard doesn't work. Buy new wireless keyboard. Plug it directly in to computer. Works great. Plug it into usb hub. Doesn't work. Plugin back in to computer. Doesn't work now. All the sudden phone that is plugged in to the usb hub goes from 100% charge to 0%. External hard drives don't work now either. 3 keyboards, phone, 2 hard drives. Dead. Because of this stupid device shorting them out. What do I do about that?"
1,Junk,"This unit broke the first time I plugged it in. The mini-USB port, which is used as the Root (the port that leads back to the PC), partially snapped off internally right off the bat. It would connect then disconnect repeatedly, before I realized what had happened. I'd call it cheap junk if it breaks that easy."
4,Lost Mansions on the Gold Coast,A one-of-a-kind collection of short stories of mostly lost mansions of the Gold Coast region of Long Island. It is always with great sadness when one learns of the lost great estates and mansion houses which we can now never see. One wonders why the children and grandchildren of the wealthy so often were not able to keep the homes of their ancestors from the wrecker's ball. This small book actually can help to save the remaining homes as it is a guide to what remains and contains information (addresses and telephone numbers) on how to visit these treasures. I found this item to be a helpful addition to my architectural book library. (LarryLufkin@comcast.net)
3,Decent coaches jacket,"This is a decent jacket. The body is tight, so order a size larger. The pockets are pretty horizontal so items won't fall out. The lining is white polyester body and white nylon sleeves. Overall decent but not great."
5,Corrosion in the Petrochemical Industry,It is an excellent book for engineers involved in the design of plant and equipment in the petrochemical industry. It covers almost all of the various chemicals generally encountered and provides sound recommendations for material selection. I have used this book for the last five years. I am buying it again as I have recently changed jobs
3,"Good, but not the best","I really like the THOU SHALT LAUGH Series as a whole, but this one was the least entertaining of the ones I have seen. It seems like they are in a steady decline. Hope the 4th one is better."
1,"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!!","I agree with all the other reviews which say that this DVD is inappropriate and crude and contains a lot of sexual references. Shame on you Thor Ramsey for writing a review of your own DVD and defending this TRASH! The back cover of the DVD says ""get together with your family, friends, and ministry groups..."" There is NO WAY I would share this with my family, friends, and especially ministry groups. The only thing I would keep from this DVD is the CASE!I liked Thor Ramsey from Thou Shalt Laugh. He was very funny without being crude. But after reading his defense of this DVD, I will NEVER buy another DVD with him on it. There are plenty of other Christian comedians who can make you laugh without resorting to innuendos and sexual references. Try Robert G. Lee or Brad Stine, or Apostles of Comedy."
2,overpriced and disappointing,"Caring about coffee, we decided to follow the reviews and the recommendation from the Wall Street Journal. The coffeemaker never worked consistently, a fairly temperamental piece of equipment, the coffee never tasted all that great, and we ended up replacing it, after a year, with a cheaper automatic maker. If the coffee maker is going to be twice as expensive, at the least it should be as good as coffee makers that are half the price."
1,This is pure fluff,Just one glance inside this book at the local super store makes it clear that the book contains no interesting facts. Whatever the author possesses he writes wimpy reviews about. Underground metal fans give this a wide breadth Popoff please write about Kansas and The Eagles which you know about
1,The writing equivalent of self-gratification,"I am saddened to see that this 'book' is the print equivalent of kiss dolls, over-priced shirts or metal (actually in the case of poseur writer popoff: hard music) bandana: Another twist in the history of taking money from the fool. It is clear, and not totally hidden, that the writer has published his own book; however the contents are more wrong than the effort. Why buy a book that a reads like dated magazine (without the timelessness of photos)? Why have the nerve to think anyone cares how you rate the music of a 1991 album?? because as clear with the writing, the author is pompous to the extreme. But 'extreme' is not where this writer is. COnfused? Don't be as he is clearly big on journey and other such rubbish. Not a metal fan, but pigeonholed in that scene as no other would take him and his desire to show off propels him to right without any substance. I put right back on the shelf"
1,SECOND HAND IMPRESSION,"Allow me to quickly admit to never having see or heard Mr. Popoff's book. However, having read the users' comments below, and being familiar with the gentleman's magazine reviews to some extent I believe I have something to add to these reviews. In his magazine reviews, Mr. popoff insists on clinging to music which he clearly has little depth and understanding in. His bravado is most explicit when he attempts to critique music of the heavier variety. It is here that he is simply out of his depth.His ignorance clearly shows, and as such he is best advised to stick with 'lighter' reviews. it is perhaps as a result of this, that one often finds confusing reviews, riddled with fancy language - the form hides the (lack of) content. I truly doubt his reviews lead to a single sale anywhere. That is unless, confusion and indifference leads to sales."
1,hard music vs metal,"A reviewer opined that should you like hard music, then you should buy this. I can not agree more. However, if you prefer heavy metal, you should stay the hell away. Popoff really knows a little about the commercial bands of that sub genre and obviously very little about the personality and true feeling of heavy metal. Did he borrow $ from daddy to print this??"
4,Obsessively Thorough,"I've had this book for five or six years and it's been a valuable resource for researching heavy music. The book covers bands of all the genres whether it be hair/grunge/industrial/speed/traditional, what have you. He turned me on to great albums from Love/Hate(Wasted in America), Riot(Fire Down Under), Corrosion of Conformity(Deliverance), Trouble(Plastic Green Head), and Michael Schenker(Built to Destroy). His writing style does loose me sometimes. However, I'm basically blown away by the depth of this book. There's just so many freakin reviews. How in the hell did this guy listen to all of these records? I like his appreciation of Queen and Thin Lizzy- two of the greatest rock bands ever. If you're serious about your hard rock music, check this book out."
1,Boy is this book a downer,"Wrong information, uninformed jabs, cacophonous language akin to chaos.- yikes!!!Who published this????"
2,BIG let down!!!!,"This game over all was a big big let down. This game was more like a movie than a video game. I found myself trying to beat it as fast as I could so that I could sell it. The game wasnt even that long, I beat it on hard under 13 hours. I would have to say rent it, beat it, (in about 3-5 days) and then thank god you didnt waste $.. plus like I did, and go out a get a sports game with replay value, cause this one sure isnt wrote playing a second time."
4,"Good game, but its more like a movie.","This game is great. Just like the last. But someone needs to let Konami know that its a video game, not an interactive movie. But I deffinately recommend this game to anyone who likes MSG1 for the PS1. Just skip all the looong movies. Hate to do it, but I can't stand to sit there forever waiting. Enjoy!"
2,A HUGE letdown!,"If (...) you loved MGS1, you WILL be disappointed unless all you care about is upgraded graphics. Now, (...) plot twists that get confusing, or even worse, boring (...) and then ridiculous (...) Then there's the boss fights...or rather the lack of them. (...) This game is a BIG disappointing mess and I went into it with a very open mind. Let me close this by making this point: MGS1 = wolf howling for atmosphere. MGS2 = seagulls flapping (...) for atmosphere. Enough said. Spend (...) less and buy MGS1."
5,Best. Stealth. Ever.,"Who cares if you don't get enough Solid Snake time? Who cares that you must play as Raiden, a first class honkey. Who cares that the story line is more twisted than Micheal Jackson? Not me. All you Tom Clancy Splinter Cell fanboys out there: SHUT UP! This is the definitive stealth game. This Hideo Kojima masterpiece is loaded with an enthralling story, charismatic characters, addicting and supremely fun gameplay, and great graphics. Oh, the graphics. These are not Splinter Cell's amazing graphics per say, but these graphics have a cool, subtle, pseudo-anime type feel. Listen, if you want to plod around in a place you can't pronounce, acting like an old lamer saving the world from an even older lamer, by all means, buy Splinter Cell. But if your in for a badass(and a honkey, who is still cooler than Sam Fisher)saving the world from nuclear destruction buy this game NOW!"
3,What's the hype all about?,"This is the first game I bought when I got my PS2. I heard so many great things about it, I had to get it. But now I'm wondering: what's the big fuss? The game is good, and can be fun to play. I just felt my interest in it wain after playing it for a while. For most RPG gamers out there, I can see the hype. There's not too much out there other than the Final Fantasy series. And in that respect, it is a pretty good RPG. But I'm not completely impressed."
1,Overhyped [...],A not bad game that is totally and complete ruined by the insane amount of movie clips attempting to 'emerge' you in the games incredably lame plot. If I wanted to see a bad movie with a ridiculously stupid plot and bad acting I'll rent a Steven Seagal movie. This disk does not even give you the satisfaction of breaking after you slam it into the edge of your coffee table.
1,Crap,"Dude, this is a movie, not a game. Beating it takes not even an hour, but watching all the ""cut-scenes"" takes about 6, probably even a lot more. The end cimena is an hour long. Your supposed to play the end and watch a short movie, not a whole movie. One part in the ""game"" you watch a 20 min cinema, walk down a two foot long hallway (which takes about 3 seconds to do) and then watch ANOTHER cinema. Half the time I walked away and did other things while the cinema was playing. Also, I never died once. Most games things get a bit tough and I die once or twice. In this it's sad how easy it is. Basically, don't buy this unless you want a movie. If your looking for intense gameplay, buy an [another game]"
5,The long-anticipated game is finally here!,"Today I got the long awaited game, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and let me tell you this... It is by far the best game that has ever made. It has a great storyline, with great depth in each plots. The graphics are excellent, the voice acting is well cast, and the sound effects is unbelievable good. This game will probably last me and maybe all of MGS2 owners a very long time to beat. MGS2 was very well worth the wait. Everybody who owns a PS2 should get this awesome game."
5,"shhh I'm Waiden, I'm hunting Wussins.","One of the greatest game in the history of the video-game universe. the wepons are the best and the graphics are insane. everythingis great about this game exept...RAIDEN!!!!He is obsesed with this girl who is helping him on a mission, he needs to cut his hair. (and probaly die it a different color.) But Solid Snake is the best!"
1,what a travesty,"my main gripe about this game is that you only get to play as solid snake for the first third of the game. for the rest of the game you play as the character raiden, who is horrribly annoying. the plot is too complex for its own good. essentially, this game is a total remake of metal gear solid 1. it has every essential element of 1. that is even one of the main plots: that anyone (raiden) can become a solid snake-like fighter if exposed to all the same conditions as solid snake was. this is just an excuse not to have anything original in the game. you only fight two bosses and they are not as cool as the ones in 1, and the ninja is not even the ninja. it is some russian chick dressed up to look like a ninja to mimic what occurs in the first game. overall, this game [...]. go play the first one. that one is the masterpiece."
5,THE BEST GAME,I am a expert gamer critic and i can say by far this is the best game in my whole carrer that i have played.It has an excelent story line and keeps u wanting to play more and more.It took me about 18 hours to beat it.I just couldnt put the controler down.Whoever made this game is a genious it was just so well made.About 3 quarters into the game there is a message that pops up when u get a call and it makes it look like a ghost or somthin has gotten into your ps2 it is so freaky that i turned it off about 2 times when ever i played it.I relized that it was programed into the game to put a lil fun into it.This is a great game.The best one i played in my life.
2,Disappointed,"Well i have to say that playing another ""japanese character with blonde hair"" really (...).I partly bought this game because i wanted to play the extremely cool Solid Snake. Instead you play this (...) character.The graphics and game play though was 100x better than the original metal gear solid.... for the first 3/4 of the game. You can tell as you get to the end of the game that they rushed the production of the game. By the end of the game, you're basically just walking on a straight path and killing people on the side. They tried to make a twist to the story but i think Hideyoshi went overboard on this one.THE LAST 1/4 OF THE GAME IS BASICALLY A GUY WALKING AROUND NEW YORK CITY WITH A HANDICAM. I would honestly say that the first MGS was 10x better in terms of game play than this one. But if your just into the graphics this one kicks (...), but i would wait for the price to go down to 20 bucks. Sorry!"
3,To much watching not enough playing.,They really should have made more effort at the game play than the cinematics. I don't know about anyone else but when I buy a game I would like to play it not watch it.
2,What was Hideo Kojima thinking all this time...?,"Greetings to all the MGS fans out there.Words cannot express how much i've waiting and wanting to play this game, i even bought my PS2 because of the Metal Gear series. The graphics, plot, and music were great, but there was something missing in the game (most of it at least) and that is... YOU DON'T GET TO USE SOLID SNAKE!!! i mean WHAT THA' HELL WERE YOU THINKING HIDEO, that we wanted to play with that girly boy you gave us name Jack, i mean what's that all about.That alone is a HUUUUUUUGE dissapoinment, i mean c'mon, Metal Gear without Solid Snake, you might as well call it ""Little girly boy at war""... God i am so (...) angry!!!Besides all that, the game is easy (...) and way too short!To all the fans who bought the game, think twice before buying the next MGS game, and to the ones that have not yet purchase the game, well... i guess it's pretty much in my review."
4,"I played it, so listen","The graphics ,the new abilities,the storyline where you wish you could tell the world that Sergei Gurlokovich(im not sure if this is correct}was mentitioned in Metal Gear Solid(and also many more connections wich some may remember from MGS 1) ,and the new equipepment are great. But it lacks three things. The game was not as long as MGS 1. ( If you didin't finish don't read this one ) It would much better if you had the Sword (I think it was a Katana) earlier.Like in the beggining of the game.Even though it was supposed to be ( you'll understand this if you finished it) , it is too much like MGS1 . So the story Is A very little bit .........umm ...how should I put this..... Bad."
4,It Rocks !! But Metal gear solid still my favorite,"I am a metal gear fan from the first release a long time ago, i have played this game and completed it in about 11 hrs and couple of minutes not the average length i would expect. The graphics is perfect in relation to fight scenes and FMVs. Not that i dont like change but i know that snake may need help to destroy all those metal gears but there was no need for him to be overthrown by this simulation kid. To be honest in the entire game play i was always looking for the kid to wake up and snake to take over. But thanks to the developers i enjoyed every whining bit. If you are are a gamer that has gotten attached to snake keep an open mind and enjoy every moment you spend playing with him in the game.still cant get enough."
3,Best ever???? I doubt it!!!!,"OK, I like these types of games, but I feel that Metal Gear Solid, and Hitman II were 2 games that didn't live up to all the hype.However, I have to be fair:This release of Metal Gear Solid II is a pretty cool game, way better than the previous MGS game, and it offers the player some really cool moves, and cool gameplay...No doubt...but, I would have like to have spent MORE TIME PLAYING the actual game, than watching all the LONG, drawn-out movies throughout the game! It gets old, really fast! Every 3-5 minutes you're watching yet, ANOTHER video clip or movie....JEESH!!!While not my favorite military-type PS2 game, it's a decent game, fairly cool to play, but doesn't really deserve a 5-Star rating, in my view."
3,A Movie For PS2,"This game is essentially a movie. I played this game for 7 hrs during which time I controled the character for probably about 20 minutes. The rest of the time is occupied with endless cut scenes and dialog. I have tried to get into the plot but there are just too many characters and entirely to much talking. To be fair, the game is very well done in regard to graphics and sound and playabilty but I personaly don't buy a game to watch it, I want to play it."
5,Good Game,This is a good action game.In this game you will gonna play wih two heroes Jack and Solid Snake.But i think that there is one thing which you will not like and that is that there are too much videos and less gameplay but overall this is the best game in ps2
4,Great with Snake....but who the hell is Raiden?,"I got the game for christmas and was so excited about it 'cause I also own MGS1.The story was so simple with snake. I thought you were going to play with him for the whole game because he is on the case. But here comes Raiden. It was funny becuase Raiden ended up being the main character, and if you look at the case, he is nowhere to be found (I think) My first thoughts were.....Is he a girl?Whats with a blond wavy haird man...ALso at the end of the game, it almost feels like your being lectured by a mental patient: all that stuff about sperate truths and reallity versus thoughts and emotions. All that crap made me feel like a hypocrite just by listening to it. Plus, there is an ""ok"" amount of replay value (just stelth, bandana and the wigs for raiden. Theres a blue one that almost makes it seem like your playing with Jeff Harddy from the WWF).It took me 16 hours to beat the game. But only 1/4 of those hours I got to play with snake."
4,"great, but no-no for kiddies","Its a great game, although its not as free roaming like 007. Its got an extremely absorbing plot with bizarre characters. One thing I dont like is a part when you're literally wading in rivers of blood and gore. Also some bad language. Those of you who own the first game breathe a sigh of relief. In this one you can actually get behind your gun. Its so realistic you can shoot birds in the sky. Minus one star for bad stuff"
3,Boring!,"Way too many cutscenes and babble, not nearly enough game play. It's ultimately very boring."
5,Metal Gear Solid 2 Substences,Before you get the good stuff like play raiden on the tank or play snake on the plant and get all the other stuff you have to have The Metal Gear Solid 2 document saved onto your memory card to unlock all that good stuff the game is great but if there gonna make a remake of the game they should have yhe game remake in it and not locked but before you Buy Metal Gear Solid 2 substences please Buy The Dockument of metal gear Solid 2 it will unlock all the good stuff like i said at the top this is not a review just a little warning before you people buy it so you dont get upset thinking that you just bought the orginal game agian thank you and enjoy the game once you get the dockument of metal gear solid 2
4,"All Around Great Game, Takes WAY to Little Time to Finish","You all know the graphics and cinematics for this game are incredible, so I won't tell you about them. They are everything to be expected and nothing less. The attention to detail is incredible! But I warn you, I conquered the game in very little time. If you work at it you'll get it in under a day. (It took me 4 hours and 34 minutes, and I never even played the original) All around it kicks butt, but I'd wait for the price to drop to pick it up, because its replayability is limited."
3,is that it?,"this game has good graphics, too bad half the game is spent listening to people feed you this dumb story. i would have liked the game alot more if it were longer with less talking. bottom line i suggest renting it, one weekend of play and you will beat it."
5,"Wow,What a Winner!","I thought I was buying this CD for one song, Step Dancing, but lo and behold every track is a stunner. The Winnowing moves one through the emotional scale from joy to sorrow with amazing skill. I laughed, I cried, I danced, and I know this will be a favorite forever!"
3,Not Hilary,"I seen the movie and loved it. I seen this doll at limitedtoo and toys r us. This doll looks NOTHING like Hilary duff I am a big Hilary fan but this doll does not look a thing like her. Its still a fun toy just not hilary. Its nice for a normal doll but I wouldnt go and put Hilary Duff on the box because it looks nothing like her as I said before, Now that I notice, none of the Hilary dolls look like hilary, at all. Thats just my opinion I still love the doll though. Overall, its a good barbie doll just not Hil."
2,Where's the usual high standard,"Although I usually read Michael Williams DragonLance novels I bought this book as it seemed the only intresting one in the quite understocked shop.Knowing Michael Williams for his poetry in the dragonlance novels and his own novels in the series such as weasels luck I was expecting even a partially decent novel, and although the prologue was good the book rapidly fell downhill, becoming confusing with a boring plot, unoriginal characters and some actual gaping holes in the plot as far as I can see, such as basing the novel in a fantasy land and then refering to places in the real world. The book was a struggle to finish reading and must be one of the only books I can remember not having enjoyed. After reading such poor material I almost feel I could do better myself and am warning you if you enjoy michael williams work stay away from this book as it will only be a dissapointment."
2,Eclectic Cafe is OK (not a must),"Fair collection of music/artists, however I was disappointed to discover than none of the versions are exclusive to this release. For example: Echo & The Bunnymen's ""Stormy Weather"" & Aimee Mann's ""Video"" are both the standard LP versions. ""Mind Of The Wonder"" by Blank & Jones is sub-titled the ""Acoustic Version"", but I am not familiar with that band or their releases. Don't be fooled by the CD title ""Eclectic Cafe"", which made me (mistakenly) think these were recorded live at some club."
2,Good Cast in Forgettable Maynard Western,"Ken Maynard and Tarzan have seen better days in this no-budget Grand National outing. Apart from the traditional Maynard stunt work, ""Six-Shootin' Sheriff"" (1938) is a plodding affair. Nevertheless, any ""B"" Western featuring Walter Long, Dick Alexander (who slugs it out with Ken in a hokey barroom brawl), Earl Dwire, Glenn Strange and Richard Cramer can't be all bad."
5,Best ever,"Bring 82 I need all the support I can get in the tub shower. I bought a new bath mat and used it three times, before it slippedand I almost went down. That's when I started to search on Amazon for something that I could feel safe using. Every one over 65should use this mat. I would save a lot of falls and hospital stays."
2,Not for a Stout appetite,"Let me get this straight.The purpose of a pilot episode is to introduce, as background material, the various characters and locations to the viewer.When bringing this series to DVD the pilot is included in the second season set.Why?Well, it does not matter.If you're an avid Rex Stout enthusiast this attempt at dramatization will leave you hungry.Maury Chaykin as Wolfe is fine casting but the poor scripting has turned the intense Nero into an eccentric grouch.Timothy Hutton, who is also Director and Executive Producer, is way offline trying to act Archie.Fritz and Cramer? Same thing. Out of character.Saving grace. The venerable Saul Rubinek who nails Lon Cohen to the veritable ""T"".If you want real Rex see the 1979 film with the late Thayer David.A ""right on"" version."
1,"WHEN ARCHIE SHOT THE GUN OUT OF THE GUY'S HAND IN THE PILOT EPISODE,","that was it for me. (...) I read most of the reviews and not once did I see anyone write that this was a campy show. But campy it is. I normally like Tim Hutton but his portrayal of Archie just appears plain silly to me. The swaggering walk? The silly grins? The knowing smiles? The pilot kind of reminded me of the Dick Tracy movie with Warren Beatty. Campy and comic-bookish. I was already pretty bored with the whole thing but when Archie shot the gun out of the guy's hand and asked ""Did that hurt? Good!"" That was pretty much it for me. If you enjoyed Batman and Lost in Space on TV when you were a kid and never grew up then you'll probably think this show is okay. (...)"
4,Not What I Expected,"This DVD was a gift for my father for Christmas. It was good, but I was hoping for something more drum focused, but it had some really good performances. The CD was a nice touch as well."
3,awesome,"When I opened this box, I had no idea what I would get. First off, let me tell you that within the first couple of packs, expect to start seeing a lot of doubles. This pack is focused around three different types of monsters, Dragon, Warrior, and Spellcaster. Some of the better cards in the series are, injection fairy lily, drop off, airknight parshath, and yata garasu. Well, good luck and I hope that this review was helpful to you."
3,Make over,"I just recently purchased this cotton duck sofa slip cover. Feb, 2009. I put it on my sofa today, thiking it was not going to fit. but, to my surprise it did fit well. I have a sofa with a much deeper set back seat then a regualr sofa. I was so happy that I was able to find a slip cover to fit this odd size sofa. I would have preferred a more dense fabric, as this slip cover is on the thin fabric side. It did need a lot of pressing to make it look better. But for the cost, it is a workable item, and does fit, and looks nice."
5,Very informative for someone thinking about self-publishing,I have been thinking about self-publishing a non-fiction book. It has been a learning experience researching everything that goes into self-publishing a book. Morris Rosenthal's book is very helpful in detailing a lot of the ins and outs of the publishing and self-publishing industry as well as a business model using print-on-demand printing.I strongly suggest anyone considering self-publishing read this book. I found that there was more I needed to learn but this book helped me get a better foundation of basic information.
2,no specific info,"this book has no specific info, it is written with broad brush strokes and doesnt have the nitty-gritty details that readers crave, that would hand-hold them through the confusing array of choices in POD publishing. (...)"
2,Title is a misnomer,"I originally wanted to learn a lot more about POD and copyrights. The author does talk about it, but the amount is so little compared to what I eventually found on the internet. I was hoping for a little more insight into the matter. If you are more interested in trying to get it published through a big company, or wanting an agent, or trying to canvas companies, then this is it. To much, though, was spent in this area with respect to the title and the write-up."
2,Not very comfortable,I bought this seat to replace the standard small seat that came with my Schwinn exercise bike which is about 15 years old. I had been using a much wider padded more comfortableseat that I bought about 5 years ago. When I had the seat correctly adjusted at the bike shop (I was slipping down onto the thin end of the seat) it proved too wide at the thighs and I was getting aches in my legs so I put the original seat back and it rode much better with no pain but was hard and uncomfortable on my rear..The seat I purchased does have the gel on the back but the seat itself is like riding a toothpick. This is a good reason to look at the product in person before buying it.It wouldn't be cost effective for me to send it back though.. Maybe on a bike that is to be ridden outdoors it would be better but I doubt it..
3,Schwinn comfort get seat review,Just got this tonight. I tried it but it's not that soft. I was trying to avoid getting a nice expensive seat and use this since this was 22 dollars only. For 22 dollars it's not that bad.
3,Good value for price,It is a good value for the price. Sound quality is okay. The earpiece is rather large and a bit cumbersome. It is uncomfortable after wearing any length of time.
2,Sound is muffled,I bought this item based on other reviews but I am not impressed. The piece that fits in my ear has somewhat sharp edges and cut my ear the first time I used it (I saw dried blood in my ear canal after removing it - not sure if I was pressing the headset in to my ear to get a better fit.)Also the microphone is fairly muffled compared to my older Motorola bluetooth headset. My callers sound clear to me but tell me that I sound muffled. I tried it on 2 different phones (LG and Motorola) and my callers reported the same muffled sound from my microphone.I wouldn't recommend this item.
3,Motorola H800-B Universal Slider Headset,"I received the headset very quickly, however, within a week of having the item I was already having problems with it. I had to send it back to the vendor to have it replaced because it sounded as if the speaker had been blown.I have not had any problems with the headset, as far as the speaker goes, since I received the new one. I do have a few challenges with the volume at times."
3,Spellcheck!,"While I have no doubt that Cindy went through this horrible experience, I just gotta say, SPELLCHECK or PROOFREAD. I don't know what annoyed me the most; being chapterless or the constant grammatical errors. Holy Moley! I just wanted to take a red pen and circle everyone of them.The only thing that got me rolling my eyes was; Why did Cindy keep going back!? and Why wasn't the poor dog given away? Or better yet taken to a shelter? Cindy's mom must have been a saint, because if it was my mom she would have said a big ""hell no"" to the moving in/out constantly!!And I would've liked an update as to her current condition, and if she's ever contacted the present owners of the house. The book left a lot open. If it was me I would have researched that house to know-end. City Hall also has owner information. Plus, I think I would have had to start digging once that pshycic told me I had bodies under my house!Just my two cents! :)"
2,better if re-written,"I've tried to read this book twice now, but cannot manage to get through it. The problem is not the story, but the books lack of proper punctuation and form."
3,The Wall,This book could have been a lot better.The story seemed to just run together it was hard to keep reading at times.I really felt sorry for the dog that was left tied up at the house and sometimes was forgotten about. at least Cindy went by a few times to feed and water the dog.I am glad Cindy and her family got out of the house.The story is not a bad one just keep in mind there are no chapters in this book it just keeps going. It is a small book but it seemed to take me a while to finish it because it is easy to put down and pick up later.
1,Lost Goods,"I'm sure I would be enjoying this product - if I had ever received it. So far, attempts to have this situation addressed have been met with a pretty steady stream of ""But it was shipped"". Shipped maybe, received never. This is the second time items ordered through Amazon partners have gone astray, and both times I ended up laying out money for items I did not receive. Any hope you can help me with this one??? I have just recently returned to using Amazon after my previous poor experience, and will certainly think much more carefully in the future about purchases through this website that I might make as special orders through local merchants such as Hastings, Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, etc."
2,Not Very Reliable/Doesn't age well,"Bought this one new a couple of years ago.First few CD's burned were [not very good] as it errorred out towards the end of the burn cycle.Getting diffrent blank discs helped for a while.Worked so-so for a few years until now.Lately the lights started blinking all the time, making weird noises, tray doesn't open/shut all the way and totally not working. A little premature considering how much I used it..."
2,doesn't age well,"i bought mine (...)with a pcmcia interface for xmas '99 when it was a new product.the drive has had problems with windows 98 drivers and connecting to various laptops since i've had it and now (12/01) fails to show in my device manager or on ""my computer"" despite showing up in the system tray correctly under its pc-card icon and despite downloading the latest drivers from freecom.com, the site of their firmware provider.philips phone support has been friendly but not terribly useful, and once the product's out of its one year warranty, they won't service it at all. the adaptec software is also harder to use than it should be and has its own problems recognizing when the drive's plugged in.my advice -- i'd probably stay away from this one...."
1,Bad Product,Did not work on my Windows ME PC. The drive wasn't detected by the included software. Do not buy. Waste of money and time.
4,not for distance,"Used them for the first time for hunting season and they were very clear and fit the use I purchased them for. We went for range a test with putting them in different cars and going down the road. Basically they were good for about two and a half miles before the static took over.I think the Midland company tests these units at the top of some mountain with nothing between the other person ""26 miles"" away. I would love to know how they come up with the rating ""26 Miles""?"
1,bracelet not anklet,purchased for a friend not long enough for an anklet . she wears it as a bracelet and she is petite
3,Review,This is an amateur look of ways to massage your woman. I didn't really learn anything from it but it may be great for others
4,25 oct 2010,I had previously oodered a couples massage video but I thought this video was a different video. To my disappointment this video had a different cover but the same vidio. Also the video I ordered months ago had two disk. One described how to massage a woman and the other described how to massage a man. This video only described how to massage a woman. I gave the disk to a friend. The video quality was very good and the massage given was on the gentel side of massages. I have only viewed the massage for woman.
3,Get's the job done,"Okay for the price, wish could have better quality mount but can't comaplain for the price.very easy to hang. there are better in the market but little pricy."
2,Aromatherapy Necklace,"Bloody small, not even CLOSE To the Image you'll see. MIGHT Hold ONE application; more a show piece than any thing useful. SO NOT Worth the charges.Essendulum Aromatherapy Necklace - Straight"
2,Difficult to use,"This is a difficult product to use. It is laid out like a book on the computer. If I wanted a book, I would have bought a book. It could be much easier to find the recipe's I want to use."
5,Mom of Two,My two year old loves Jay Jay the Jet Plane and all his friends. Tuffy added to our collection and she loves him.
1,Great for making coasters!,"As a coaster maker I give this unit 5 stars......heck 6 stars, but as a CD burner I'd give it zero stars if I could. Even on a fast machine with plenty of memory you get numerous buffer underruns and you get them almost everytime. I've tried all the best burner software from Roxio to Nero and have tried it in 3 computers and only 1 of the 3 computers did it even work half of the time.All in all a very shotty unit and not what I'd expect from the company that invented the CD-Rom!As Uncle Jed would say........""pitful....jest pitiful"""
1,Bad Choice,This CD burner worked for about 4 burns and then just died. It won't even read a CD. I think the laser is messed up. I'm going to take it back. Don't buy this one folks or do and see if you have a better experience than I did.
1,Displeasure with Phillips,"I am very displeased with the Philips CD-RW. The installation was very simple. However, I burned 12 CD's the first night and I've gotten errors ever since. I contacted Technical Assistance and they informed that the burner DOES NOT support 80 minutes CD's, contrary to the Philips information. I returned the burner."
1,Don't buy this item -- Big Problems,"This product is poorly made and has multiple manufacturing problems, which could have been avoided: The idea is to use a GPS transmitter to locate your lost dog. Here is why I returned mine:1. GPS transmitter is NOT waterproof. The grey plastic case has a 2 inch long gap that would easily allow water to get inside it and destroy the electronics. Even overnight condensation could damage the unit.2. GPS transmitter easily falls out of the cheap black plastic case that attaches to your dogs' collar. You could find the transmitter (assuming no exposure to moisture), but not your beloved dog, who could be long gone.3. Antenna was shipped quite loose.Company was unresponsive when I notified them of these problems. I even offered remedies/inexpensive fixes they could have used, which they did not.Wait until another company comes up with a quality GPS locator for your dog, then buy it."
1,This product is worthless,"Don't pay $350 for device that doesn't work. GPS location at my house keeps changing addresses, none of which are my actual address. So even if it were to actually text me that my dog is out of the fence (Which he is currently according to the command center) I would never really know where he is. Bad product literature. You have to sign up for 2-3 year service cellular service plan that only gives you a certain number of ""out of fence"" alerts per month(3 on my plan and then additional charges for each alert) has yet to text me that my dog is out of the fence even though the web site clearly states he is out of fence. Batteries only last a few hours when fully charged. No piece of mind when out of town, or if he gets out and you were to actually know it, you would have very short amount of time to locate a dog that may be within a few blocks in any direction of the address it claims to be."
2,good paper,"This is a bit misleading, it is a far cry from being even 50% ""COMPLETE"" I have been in gun smithing and reloading for over 30 years. But it is printed on good paper, and will help in a pinch to start a good camp fire."
5,Good Vitamins,"These are good vitamins. I judge a vitamin by the 2 things: whether or not I feel good when i'm taking them and what they do to my pee.I think these vitamins give me good energy. My pee comes out neon. I'm sticking with them...enough said.Edit: I should mention that I'm comparing these against kroger One-a-day (seem worthless to me), GNC mega-man (good but overpriced) and animal-paks (maybe the best, if you don't mind taking 15 horse pills every morning, and also expensive.)"
4,Not what I ordered,"When ordering these, the description & picture was the Alive with ""No Iron Added"".... I received the ones w/iron. I do take the Alive without iron regularly. I am not really happy that I didn't get what I was supposed to be ordering. Didn't take time to send back, but will cancel future orders. Also, I had put on a 60 day delivery & they have already charged me for another order at 30 days."
4,pretty good!,"fits 17"" laptop easily.lots of easy to access compartments - organization is good, but not quite as roomy as my old bag with just one big space.rolls well. curved handle reduces load on hands, but do occasionally hit heel since bag is closer to feet.best laptop bag I've used."
1,This was a great product before they changed it,Kensington obviously took a bad lesson from the American automotive industry. This rolling bag was perfect. Now the quality is garbage and the materials used boggle the mind. I have owned three of these and had to return this recent purchase as the product is no longer usable. Now I am stuck trying to find a decent rolling bag.
5,Great Bag!,"We purchased this bag for a family vacation as we had two lap tops we wanted to bring with us. They both fit great, and it also held several other carry on items - there was room galore. The bag held up well, and it was very easy to steer even when I was laden down with other roller bags. Fantastic - glad we bought it!"
4,Bulky but gets the job done!,This is a very wide case and takes some getting used to while rolling behind you. The small compartment in the back was an unexpected but nice surprise to store some travel items. The shoulder strap isn't as comfortable as other computer cases I have owned but works fine.
5,A Winner,Just a note on this wheeled carry-all computer bag. It is well orginized with easy access to all areas. This bag rolls easily and is stable dispite the single post handle. Similar bags were much more expensive than what I paid on Amaxon.
1,Buyer Beware!!!!,"This was SUCH a great bag!!!!! I had my bag for about six years until I broke the zippers off(Very heavy use. Kensington switched vendors and this is not the bag you see in the pictures. It does not have the nice hard plastic on the zippers - it's just the metal now. Also, less zippered pockets in the bag. Don't get me wrong, for people who never had the old bag it's not a huge loss. It's still a nice bag, but just much cheaper. Kensington really needs to update their picture because it's not the same bag. HEY KENSINGTON!!!! IT'S BAIT AND SWITCH YOU PIG!!!!"
2,Junk !!,"Watch out ! Check the manufacturing date at the bottom of the robot. I got August 2008 ! This is too old and the battery won't hold charge, that's why I read several complains.I bought it yesterday and found out one motor is broken (yellow cable). Should I return this to store ? Forget it, I got a good price for this toy and I'm going to hack it. I have disassembled it, removing everything and I will transform this into a better robot with:1. Better antenna2. New battery (will be 8 AA 2200mAh, the factory is 1800 mAh NiMh)3. Intercept signaling (I2C or just the LED to control camera tilting, etc)4. New motorFor anyone who doesn't have tinkering skill, stay away from this toy !"
1,No customer service / BEWARE CHARGING STATION RECALL,"Assembly may be a little challenging for some kids, but overall not bad just take an extra look at each picture. (Illustrated instructions only).Operating the robot in local mode basic and intermediate is easy but requires occasional reset. Also automatic docking stopped working.We still have not been able to set up the robot in advanced mode (remote control). This was the main reason for buying the toy to keep an eye on the pets. Complaint of issues to customer support several times though e-mail without receiving any feedback for now 4 weeks. Same issue with charging station recall no new replacement or contact. BEWARE OF CHARGING STATION RECALL SEE [...]Bottom line its only a toy not a surveillance camera (terrible low light even with build in lamp)."
3,Stay with Joel's books rather than DVD's!,"Accurate and informative information but stale in presentation. Perhaps updates on current Middle East activities? Books are awesome, DVD just so so!"
4,"Healthy, filling, and delicious","I bought these off-site, in the multi-flavor pack. By far the vanilla was my favorite. It tastes creamy, with a true-vanilla flavor. Kudos for a healthy bar that actually fills. The NuGo has substance, and will quench the cookie-monster that lurks inside all of us. Besides sheer weight, it's good to see a bar with real ingredients--real food, rather than the multi-syllabic, chemically questionable stuff that often seems to make up the bulk of this kind of product. All this at a great price.My one detraction is that the bars mimic a glorified rice krispy. I know, I know--they're not candy bars. I'm even okay with the crunchy sweetness. However, I could see growing tired of the sameness of the texture over time.Bottom line: I solid four-stars for a great tasting, filling, nutrition bar, offered at a reasonable price. It will be hard to beat this one, though some may want a second kind, just for variety."
4,Beautiful Scottish Fiddle Playing,"Alisdair Fraser's playing is notable for its dynamic shading, purity of pitch, and overall tender and gentle sound. He has a refined technique that sounds almost classical at times. Fraser is at his best on the slow laments and airs. On this CD the fiddle is set against an imaginative variety of accompanying instruments, harp and flute being prominent. If you know the playing of Bonnie Rideout, I would say her playing reminds me more of morning mists and the smell of moss and lakes, whereas Fraser appeals to me just because of a good violin sound. Highly recommended."
2,"Interesting idea, but just a useless gadget","Bought this a while ago, thinking it would be great to have a dustpan that sucks up the little bit of stuff that never gets swept into the pan. However, the angle you have to hold the dustpan is too steep to be useful, so it's really not a great product."
4,A good Beginning,It was a great 12 episodes that everyone should own or have seen. Although things didn't get as good until the second season its still worth watching. These episodes are great with smart writing and great acting I definitly reccomend it!
4,Didn't let me down.,The second season didn't let me down! The product came in on time and in excellent condition.
5,At long last...,"I didn't think that anything could top season #1. But hold on to your Cosmopolitans; Season #2 is even better.For those of you not familiar with Sex and the City, the premise is this: 4 attractive single women friends experience life, love and -- yes -- sex in Manhattan. The men who pass though their lives will seem strangely familiar to many of you (us!) unmarried gals watching: the lovable gay pal, the sexy personal trainer, the fellow who's just a tad too attached to his [dirty movies] and -- of course -- the maddeningly attractive but emotionally remote Mr. Big.With all the nutty escapades that Charlotte, Samantha, Miranda and Carrie experience, their enduring friendship remains the one constant throughout every episode. They guffaw, cry, commiserate and analyse their way through each major (and minor) ordeal... TOGETHER.Go on. You know you want it."
3,Not able to hear the characters over background noise,The audio portion of the characters is sometimes not able to be heard over background noises and is sometimes annoying.
4,Telegraph Transmit,"Radio Rescue shows how even young people can help others. Lynne Barasch writes about her father as a 10-year-old boy, who in 1923 falls in love with the newly created telegraph machine and spends two years becoming a telegraph operator. This boy became an experienced operator and in 1926 was able to relay a message which lead to the rescue of a family in Key Largo, Florida.This is an historical non-fiction picture book with full-page color cartoons written in first person from the perspective of the author's father. The book also includes a time line of the invention of the telegraph, a list of the advantages of the telegraph, and a chart of Morse code.Radio Rescue is suggested for 5-8 year olds but 8-11 year olds would understand the concept better. Robert J. Marx, the author's father, wrote [this book is a] ""mostly true and faithful recording of my very younger days""...[and he is] ""...stil completely [sic] fluent in Morse code as I learned it at age 10..."""
2,Not a clock neither a camara,"I buy this camara to see the room of my childs to check the nany and at the same time to wake up my little girl to go to preschool. The thing is that the camara have a bad reception in the second floor when you are in the first, the lens of the camara is pretty obvious and the clock go ahead 11 minutes every day so you have to be correcting it all the nights.its no good for both of their functions."
3,Any port in a storm,Camera works great. Clock doesn't work at all. The camera is my focus so I'm happy. Suitable but go ahead and spend another $50 on an upgraded product.
1,You Want Cheap?,"This is a product of little quality. I heard handheld transistor radios in the 60's with better sound quality than this. The analog tuning knob is fairly sensitive. Mine doesn't get very wet, because I have it hanging behind me, away from the water flow. I must admit, though, based on what I've learned from the other reviewers, I am tempted to hold mine under a running shower, where I understand it will cease operating at once and then I'll have an excuse to go find something better."
5,Outstanding Collection,"This CD has it all if your looking for a great Lynyrd Skynyrd compilation. It exceeds the excellent Blue and Gold compilation with additianal less known hits, but great songs in thier own right."
3,Bateria para mi camara,En general la bateria que recibi estaba nueva y funciono bien en mi camara el unico problema es que el vendedor la ofrece como una bateria de 1200mah cuando realmente es de 760mah (muchas menos horas de duracion).
1,We don't all fit this mold.,"As a recently reunited adoptee experiencing a broad range of emotions, I looked to this book to help aid in the healing process. I just did not like the writing style. In this book, Lifton describes the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of a few as being universal. I was looking for validation of my feelings rather than more reasons to become angry and resentful - which is what happened with this book. The final straw for me was reading Lifton's words, ""...adoption is abortion after birth."" I quickly discovered this book was going to do nothing for me except make me angry and resentful toward others for my ""place in life"" rather than helping me work through my feelings about MYSELF.If you are looking to get a grip on, and understand, your feelings, you should check out the book ""Being Adopted: The Lifelong Search for Self."" This book doesn't put ideas in your head, but instead helps you work through the ones you already have, in an easy to read, comforting manner."
4,Must have for a long day,"This product does work, look up an instructional video on how to use the sheets. BUYER BEWARE, these are well known to cause acne, so if you're looking for an acne fix, then look somewhere else. Sorry =( I don't have very oily skin, but near the end of the day it gets oily, and drives me nuts. As a boy, I cant just use makeup to solve my skin flaws. These are great and with a small pack fit in my pocket. I use them at work near the end of the day. The sheets feel thin and absorb almost all of the oil, and stops my face from being so shiny. If you do have oily skin, and need to use three to four a day, its not good for your skin, they do have chemicals that cause acne. Combine these with tissue paper, like Kleenex or the kind you put in gifts, and it should help drastically.Overall very useful, and good for summer when your skin gets oily at the end of the beach day. I don't use them regularly, and don't recommend that anyone does."
5,I LOOOVVVEEEE THIS!!!,"This oil-absorbing sheets is really good my face gets really oily especially my nose. And whenever I apply make-up and a couple of minutes go by my face looks so greasy like there was no make-up to begin with, so when I tried this product I instantly feel in love with it, it absorbed all the oil on my face and never smudged my make-up I'm just sorry that I didn't buy 2 packs lol."
1,Assyrians in Chicago,"If ever there was a book that was not worth the money it cost ""Assyrians in Chicago"" is that book! The style is so hopeless. Warning: do not read this book while operating heavy machinery! You may hurt yourself! This books is so borring, that it may make you depressed. Save yourself the money and donate it to some poor Assyrian, in stead of buying this worthless collection of meaningless papers. God help you Mr. Vasli Shoumanov. You really should consider finding another job, besides being an author. How about being a fake Assyrian?"
2,Glad to they took a chance on it but unacceptable packaging,"I just received my set so I am compelled to write my review. I do appreciate their having taken a chance on making a profit on this show as I know it is a risk. However, like I commented on the other review that gave it more stars, you open the box and the insert falls out. They give you no place to store the insert with the list of content. Anybody who buys this show is a collector. And no collector is going to enjoy that about his collection. I wonder if Jay Ward's widow approved this packaging? Hopefully, season 5 is released with packaging acceptable to those who love this show."
5,Soo good,These guys were my favorite as a child and am so happy to have it. I highly recommend it if you love Rocky and Bullwinkle.
3,Okay,Really a new college grad going on a potentially dangerous hunt for her husband and dragging her daughter with her?
2,Plastic,"The face is metal & look really good, but the back ""tube"" is plastic! You would just kick it off to break it. Looking for metal part to replace the plastic."
3,yeah,"this is really a very good book, but i didnt think that it suited me very well. this is a stupendous book if you know absolutely nothing about design, but otherwise dont bother. it covers so many subjects that it cant help but just scratch the surface."
4,Good diaper bag for travel,"I bought this for our first plane and cruise trip with my 21 month old son. Quality of the bag is great especially the zipper. I can use only one hand to zip it and it doesn't twist. Very smooth. Very roomy. I put some snacks on the top packet, diapers on the outer pocket. The main storage pocket is very roomy. I put an ipad, portable DVD player, and some toys in there. It stands well when you put it on the table. And the straps feel comfortable. But I wouldn't use it when not traveling because I am used to purse style diaper bag. But it's great for husband and traveling."
5,Exelant Diaper Bag,These backpack diaper bags are great. Lots of compartments and the quick access to wipes is a God send. Would like to see an optional divider for the spacious main compartment. Clothing on the bottom has a tendency to get forgotten about untill we open it up all the way to restock. All in all a great bag for all occations.
2,Great design; poor quality,We love the design of this bag-- if only it was constructed better! The zippers on the side pockets were the first to go -- after only a few weeks. A year later we are looking for a replacement. For $90 one expects much better!
