1,HORRIBLE,"This is cheap,cheap,cheap. The plastic hinge piece broke off the second time I used it, and the company customer service was terrible. Don""t buy this product!"
2,hinged microwave egg cooker,"I bought this product, or one that looks just like it, at the local grocery store to replace my favored Tristar Eggwave cooker. Long story short, I don't think it's a good product. The cooker is a two-piece hinged top and bottom, and it often would pop open in the microwave, making a mess. I have to keep on using it because it's the only thing I have. Eventually the hinge broke and now it's two separate pieces, which although can still be fastened, are guaranteed to pop open.Just now I poached some eggs in it, and when I went to scrape one of the eggs out of the cup, the egg exploded, making a mess all around the microwave and my face. So the egg doesn't even have to be in the microwave for it to explode using the cooker. Now I'm looking for a good replacement online, and came across this list of items at Amazon.Avoid this product."
1,Porter-Cable Yes! Amazon Reconditioned Products No!,Am returning this item as it was received without any owner's manual or other documentation and was covered with sawdust. If this saw was reconditioned then I don't know what reconditioned means. The blade actually had sawdust caked behind the teeth. I would assume that reconditioning at least means blowing the saw off with compressed air before packing for shipment... That way I'll get the owner's manual and warranty info too.
3,Started flaking after first use,"I purchased this plate to use on my electric stove in conjunction with a Tagine (Moroccan clay cooking pot). I used it once with the Tagine and it worked fine as far as diffusing the heat so that my pot heated evenly. However, I noticed after the first use that the black coating started flaking immediately. I'm not sure if this is supposed to do this or not but it doesn't seem like it should be doing this first time out.I've used it once since then and it still seems to be working. It's pretty ugly now though so I put it in the cabinet instead of leaving it on the stove. I've purchased other Nordic Ware made items and never had this problem."
1,"Warps with normal use, color comes off","I bought this to create a flat cooking surface on my electric stove. It worked really well initially, but after 1 month of careful & normal use it started to warp. Now it is completely warped and has a visible ""hump"" in the middle - no flat cooking surface anymore! Also, the black color comes off easily with a Scotchbrite kitchen sponge (or even a damp cloth) and also scratches when you move pots on it.I've returned it to amazon and will get a replacement to see if there was something wrong with this batch of burner plates; another review here states the same problem, though, so I assume they'll warp again."
5,"6"" Burner Plates",Excellent item for keeping foods simmering on electric stove; it fits right over the burner.
5,Lifesavers,"These wint-o-green flavored lifesavers have provided enjoyment for over 10,000 girls at the Girl Scout camp on my night hikes."
5,Towable Harness,Couldn't be happier with this product. It is just the thing to have if you have a boat with an outboard motor. Keeps the tow rope in line and is strong enough for children as well as full grown adults. Highly recommend the Kiwk Tek Harness Self Centering Pully.
4,Keeps towable centered on the back of the boat,Keeps towable centered on the back of the boat. You need this to safely tow riders. Only 4 stars because it is showing some rust. However I use it in salt water and have not always rinse it afterwards. So I would say it is more my fault than the products fault.Dont tow without a self centering pulley if you are going to use a boat with an outboard and the rear cleats!! Angree with other raters that the spring clips should be bigger. Easy fix though.
2,Works as advertised for a little while.,I bought this item so that we could pull our tube and kneeboard. The package came quick and the product worked as advertised. A system of this type is definitely needed if you do not have a tower on your boat.Now for the negative. The clips that connect to your boat are made of carbon steel. After 1 month of use (every weekend) they have completely rusted out and or now useless. Because the clips are connected to the rope from the factory I have to buy a new one. I will not be replacing it with the same product. I'm going to try and find one with stainless steel connections.
3,"Great price, okay quality","I've now used the harness about a dozen times after having it for a little over a month and it seems to work well. My primary complaint is that one of the hooks completely rusted on the exterior after the first or second use. Still works, but looks like it is ten year old now..."
5,All-in-one fact book for aspiring Londoners,"I was happy to find this book because it answered all the questions I had about going to London and spending about six months there. It goes beyond the tourist layer of London (which is pretty thick) and gets you into the city as it exists for Londoners. Even after several months here I still refer to it often and it has helped me to really enjoy the city, away from the madding crowds."
4,Greta value,"Great Speakers for the money, I installed them in the back of a 1979 Triumph spitfire convertible and they work and sound fantastic, very easy installation"
5,passed the C ASCP,Passed the C ASCP with a 646 score in Sept 2011 using this book! A must have! Easy to follow format and BOC like questions
5,Who's having more fun?,"I just bought this bucket of fun today and it has already entertained an 11yr old, a 7yr old, a 5yr old and my daughter who is 2. She's having a blast. There is so much you can do. And while I'm writing this review I'm not sure who's having more fun my husband or my daughter.Play doh has been around forever, I remember playing with it as a child and the smell just brings me right back to those times. It is great for the imagination. I look forward to see what Ella will create.This toy is a definite must buy. And there aren't any batteries!!!"
5,Filled with Yiffy Goodness,"Shay Ranay made me gyggle as if someone was scrytchyng me sylly! Sylly hyoomans may not appreciate her transformation from Ranay to Crystal Star, but this is some seriously hot stuff, and well done too. This book takes furfyctyon to a new level!As someone who can't really leave the house that often anymore (without help gyggle!) to make it to the multiple cons with my fellow furs, I really rely on furfyctyon for spyooge tyme. Crystal Star does not fail to deliver, let me tell you! Although the lack of underaged and seriously cyute male characters is distressing (Hoping the sequel will include that, how about it S. R. Thames??), what is there was worth the 6 weeks it took to read this medium sized book.All in all, I still give it 5 stars and a paws up!!!"
1,Overpriced gimmick,"This item even at a price a few dollars from 'list', is just twaddle. Yes you put it over your reheated take outs. It's just a single piece of plastic with a hole on top. If you buy a cake, something similar is often included free. And local, NYC, chinese take-outs offer similar lids gratis. A dozen things around will offer the same modest help in the micro. Also it retains the *smell*, yes, even after a sudsy soak. Save your $7+. My first negative review. I don't offer my opinions lightly.dan"
2,Not very pleased,"I bought this item, and very shortly( a month or 2) after using it, it started to crack. The cracks got worse with more use. I liked the size and design of the plate cover, but was disappointed with the quality and how fast it started to crack. Others said they used theirs for 2 years or more - maybe I got a defective one.Kathy"
4,Anti-splatter tool that seems to work,"In a moment of total weakness, I ordered this after having to clean out my microwave oven because of a tomato splatter. I've used this cover a few times, and it does seem to work. One thing though, you get a certain amount of condensation on the inside of the unit as things are cooking (no big deal, it's just water). I haven't had any big splatters yet, but the small one just wiped off the plastic afterward (in the sink instead of having to clean up the mess in the micro). It's big enough to put a full size dinner plate on top of, and it works for most average size freezer special commercial dinners. So far I have been happy with the purchase although it seems to be a bit expensive for a piece of plastic. Are you ready for the miracle? The thing is actually made in the USA!"
5,food cover,"I absolutly love this item, it works great and make the food not to dry out when you warm it in the microwave."
2,"what type of plastic is it? Is it 3,6,7 (with phthalates)?","Hi- I have an old microwave cover. I always put food into glass dishes to microwave them, to avoid plastic leaching into the food at high temps, but didn't think about the microwave cover, where the steam condenses and drips back into the food.Now today I read a NYT column with the lines ""...many Americans still use plastic containers to microwave food, in ways that make toxicologists blanch..."" The whole article is at [...]It also says that the 3,6,7 plastics are the ones with phthalates.So I think it's important to know what type of plastic the cover is, or even if there are glass microwave covers out there.Does anyone know this, or how to find out? I'd like to reduce plastics for hot-food use as much as possible. Thanks!"
5,No more need for wax paper,"The only suggestion to improve this product would be the diameter being a little larger. There are some plates that it does not quite cover. Otherwise, it is perfect and quick as a means of containing any possible splatter in the microwave."
5,No more messy microwave splatters!,"Great thing to have. I no longer need to cover items with paper towels, or plastic that often contacts the food I'm heating!My sister had one of these and I loved it at her house so I went looking for one."
3,Lifetime Use Expectancy,"I purchased this product exactly two years ago. It performed as I had hoped. It fit my microwave carousel perfectly. It has not been abused nor mishandled or subjected to heat other than that in the microwave. However, within the last month or two, cracks began to appear in the plastic, vertically up to the crown. I don't know if this is the normal life span, but I am disappointed in the two year useage I experienced. I will order a replacement since I was really satisfied with the original. Maybe the second one will last longer!!!"
2,Nice until it starts cracking!,"It's a nice plastic cover and keep the microwave clean. But it's not very durable. I like it enough to buy it for the second time, but it cracked within a month this time. NO MORE!"
3,Too big,I had a old one that I went back to using. This one is too big for the unit.It also cost too much.It is just a waste of my money.
4,Works as advertised,Microwave Plate Cover works as advertised and it goes in the dishwasher. Reasonably priced versus similar products. Saves money on disposables
1,"POOR QUALITY, THEY CHANGED IT!","We bought these covers at Walmart and needed to replace them and Walmart stopped carrying them, so I searched on the internet and bought 3 on Amazon.com. After 2 uses the bottom edges burnt away! They changed the plastic they use to some inferior plastic that melts! So, I'm stuck with these, and I am using the old one that doesn't melt. Do not buy this unless they go back to making them the way they used to, with good, sturdy plastic."
5,mICROWAVE pLATE COVER,"THIS IS A GREAT ITEM TO KEEP FOOD FROM MAKING A MESS INSIDE YOUR MICROWAVE, HOWEVER IF YOU LEAVE IT ON THE STOVE AND TURN THE BURNER ON IT WILL MELT lol. SO THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I HAVE PURCHASED! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
2,nice but short-lived,"Not long after purchase, cracks started to appear...more and more...eventually broke completely apart. Loved it while it lasted (less than a year)."
5,interesting book--disappointed with recent developments,"I found the (audio)book captivating. However, about 2/3 of the way through the book it started to seem like a PR piece for Thompson and I began to wonder if any of the investers ever got their money back. After doing a little research, I found that Thompson has dropped off the map and the investors are suing him as he has not paid out anything--and it has been 21 years since the treasure was recovered. Some think the entire treasure has been spent. The book may have been premature in its praise for this ""genius"" Thompson."
2,poor-average,"Very detailed, but a very unsatisfying ending. Greg Kinder spends 486 pages detailing the sinking and recovery of the gold, then wraps it up with a 15 page epilog which doesn't tell what the principle characters are doing now, what is happening to the gold, or the outcome of some of the lawsuits mentioned in the book. Also, if you are looking for photos of some of the spectacular things Kinder descripes, forget it. A book this detailed should have had pages of photos, but all that are given are a few postage stamp sized ones on the back jacket cover."
3,Ship of Gold Review,"The story is interesting, but the first half of the book seemed to flow better than the second half. The second half was disjointed, seemed to be written at a different time or by someone different. The ending was abrupt, inconclusive and uninteresting."
5,"Facinating tale of history, human drama and perserverance","This book reads like two dramas. The first part is the story of the ships sinking and you feel like you are reading well written historical fiction. The exciting part and the part that keeps you facinated is the fact the story is true, verified thru hundreds of accounts and interviews with survivors. The book then skips ahead more than 100 years and tells the tale of a group of people who ""invented"" the technology to recover the ship and its gold and the years of trials and tribulations they went through to reach for thier dream. I havent read a book this gripping in quite a while."
3,Lots of foreplay with little payoff,"Gary Kinder strikes gold with his retelling of the sinking of the Central America. This narrative sets the hook but the rest of the book leaves the bait tasting stale. Sure, there's plenty of interesting tidbits, but Tommy Thompson must be one secretive guy - does anyone notice that his personal recollections are few and far between? Where are the photos? Mr. Kinder provides the reader with plenty of detail on the information he must have been privy to, but evidently this did not include a peek at the excitement of an actual treasure. He, like many members of Thompson's ""team,"" apparently found the door closed when he tried to follow the rainbow to it's end. Reading this book was like climbing Mt. Everest - only to find it foggy at the top."
5,Satisfying to both A traveler and history buff,"Love Gary Kinder's writing! This book is haunting, tremendously interesting and a page turner. I highly recommend it to anyone who has a love of history, exploration and the sea."
5,"Fascinating, fast-paced..an author in command of his subject","A fascinating read. It is really two stories. First, it tells the historical tragedy of the sinking of the Central America and over 500 of her passengers along with 21 tons (yes, tons) of California gold. The most compelling story, though, is of a brilliant young landlubber who dreams of deep-sea salvage. If you're a history buff, or if you enjoy contemporary real-life adventure stories (like The Perfect Storm or Into Thin Air, for example) you will enjoy this book greatly. I've never read anything by Gary Kinder before, but I will keep an eye out for his next book, whatever it is!"
5,"Gripping, Historically unforgetable!","After reading this book, I'm convinced that Gary Kinder is the Steven Spielberg of non-fiction literature. I can't wait for the screenplay! Kinder captures the reader instantaneously and doesn't let go until you can no longer keep your eyes open, or run out of reading material, which ever happens first. Mr. Kinder, please don't make us wait another ten years for your next book! Congratulations on writing the best book I have ever read."
2,Unlikeable characters and comic book action,"My favorite genres are mysteries and historical fiction and so I looked forward to immersing myself at Blenheim Palace with Winston Churchill's family just after the start of the last century. What I got was a story where nearly every character, including the author/protagonist and his wife, were thoroughly unlikeable, and people were chasing each other and wrestling on top the rooftop and stuff. Do you know how some books you want to never end? Well, this was the exact opposite of that -- I couldn't wait to get it over. There was a bit of an intriguing mystery around some old letters, but the Nancy Drew-ish chasing through hallways and up and down stairs action and nasty people turned me off. My favorite line: "".. Mrs. Belmont agreed, as she bit into a French eclair with relish."" There are better ways to spend a ""weekend"" than spending time with these unlikeable characters and improbable events."
1,Doesn't work for dog who poop!,I used this on my lawn where people walk their dogs and let them poop and I am so tired of picking up other people's dog poop so I have tried everything including this product and it did nothing. Dogs pooped right on top of it. Not sure if it works with any other animals
2,"So far, disappointed.","I bought the drive with many expectations, based on some other reviews, but I am not very happy so far.First of all, it doesn't bring instructions. It brings a dual USB cable, but I don't know which connector two use. Sor far, it seems that both connectors are necessary all the time, when the hard drive works. If I want to buy an external power source, no specifications are provided other that the 5V DC printed on the case.Second, I have Windows XP, and it seemed to recognize it at once, the first time I connected it, but I am disappointed seeing that it doesn't work all the time. Honestly, I don't know if this is a problem with the operative system, the connector, the energy provided bt the PC USB ports, or simply that the drive is not working properly.I managed to test the hard drive with the Wire Fire cable, and it worked well, but the problem is that most PC's don't bring this type of ports."
3,this waffle iron has a nonstick coating!,"I specifically bought this iron because the discription did not mention a nonstick coating. I was willing to endure the inconvenience of a non-electric model merely because I wanted to avoid those toxic chemicals. Alas, when it arrived, it had a nonstick coating. Back in the box it goes. I will buy the lodge cast iron pan instead."
3,Not as advertised,"We have used a similar Nordic Ware Belgian Waffler for years and have loved it. When the non-stick surface finally began to fail after MANY years of frequent use, I searched for a replacement. I was delighted to find an exact match offered by Amazon, so I ordered two. Sadly, when the order arrived, the wafflers were not as shown in the photos. The waffler we've used for so long included two very useful temperature gauges. The waffle maker on the Amazon item page was clearly portrayed with the gauges, but the wafflers I received did not have them. When my 87 year old father makes breakfast, he depends on those gauges to indicate when the waffler is hot enough to make the light crispy waffles that we all love. If you don't care about the temperature gauges, don't hesitate to order this waffler."
5,Love it,So easy to use. It's quick and makes great waffles. I wanted a waffle iron but since I don't use it much I wanted something that I can easily store. This is perfect. I just made pumpkin waffles..... So good and easy.
4,Industrial strength modern jazz,I'm sure that USA readers of this review won't mind me saying that American jazz fans are fairly conservative-which is reflected by so many of the jazz musicians who score recording contracts. But this wonderful CD by Dave Holland and his group show that you can make exciting melodious modern jazz without simply repeating the past. Enough lecturing! This is just great music. Rythmically innovative and tuneful to boot with solos that burn. What else do you want. BUY IT! I'd give it 5 stars but i need one left over in case Dave's next album is better.
5,Star Wars The New Droid Army,"This is just a great game. You are Anakin Skywalker, and the time is just after the movie Attack of the Clones. You are on a mission to find out about a new type of Battle Droid being manufactered by Count Dooku. Pros: Lightsaber battles at the end of each level. many different enemies. Deflect laser fire back at opponent. Go to differt planets. Choose between Padawan, Knight, or Master levels. Learn new force abilities like Jump, Push, Speed, Meditate, and Hide. Use different lightsaber moves. Really good graphics. Mini-movies every once in a while. The game even starts with the dissapearing gold letters going into the backround like in the movies. Cons: Some parts you just walk around alot. You need passwords to save. You can finish it in only a few days if you're good enough. Summary: Overall this game is awesome and I reccomend it to anyone who has a Gameboy Advance."
3,"OK, yet a little too easy.","This game is good, don't get me wrong but I think it's a little to easy, even on Jedi Knight.(the hardest level setting) You are Anakin Skywalker who must defeat Count Dooku and other Dark Jedi and if you know what to do it seems like it's Luke Skywalker against a regular human in a lightsaber match.(EASY) Although this game has good gameplay and fairly good graphics for a Gameboy Advance game.When I say a little too easy I mean really easy. This game is so easy you can pretty much walk through each level without getting hit, I definetly think that this game is not hard because many people were complaining that Star Wars Bounty Hunter was to hard. Although this game is pretty good I gave it 3 stars because it was to easy. If you are a good gamer I really wouldn't bother with this game unless you really really want to."
3,Innovative,"A nice little book of braiding and twisting styles. Most are easy to learn, and the illustrations are pretty good. I had a problem seeing the completed hairstyle because the photos were black and white. There are quite a few Afro-American styles that looked nice and seemed easy to accomplish. The book is a paperback and a little on the small side, probably 4x6 inches. Simple, and easy instructions."
4,Great Romantic Comedy !,"I just finished reading this book last night. It is a really great romantic comedy. I agree that it does have a modern day feel to it, and it should be made to be a movie. One can really tell what's going to happen at the end, so the ending is no surprise. Be prepared to look up some words, but if you have the Kindle, you can pretty much do that, immediately. I really enjoyed reading this book."
2,Don't read this novel if you expect an actual conclusion,"With the enticing cover artwork and an intriguing storyline, this novel had the beginnings of a good read. Somewhere along the way the story veared away from the plot, abandoned a central character and ended in a puffery. The love story feels forced and the opportunity to engage in some very interesting challenges are totally missed. The plot of a man who acquires the gift of restoring life dissipates into a paranoid anti-government rant.I was disappointed as the book cover quotes that the author has written nineteen ""acclaimed"" novels. I expected more than what I received in reading this book.Most disappointing is that the reader never receives an answer to the main question - how did this happen and what does it mean? It almost seemed like the author tired of the story and just closed shop after 300 pages with a pasted together conclusion. A good potential story ended in unachieved dramatic results. Not the good read this reader expected."
1,Very unlikely plot mixed with silly Gov't paranoia,The Resurrectionist has an interesting premise but ultimately the author's penchant to indulge in outrageous government conspiracy paranoia makes the whole story silly.
2,Scholarly but incoherent.,"Amazon.com has the confusing habit of combining all the reviews of different translations of works. Note well that this review applies only to Francis Woodman Cleaves' translation. The book has millions of footnotes, but the translator, regrettably, attempted to render it into King James English, and it didn't come out well at all; it's nearly unreadable. I have no trouble at all with the KJV or Shakespeare, but this translation makes my eyes glaze over."
4,"A little disappointed, but still quality work","If you have seen Uberzone live then you know that he is purely sensational. And if you know Uberzone, you know that all his previous singles have been dope. I guess that's why I was a little disappointed. This album is very good, but I expected it to be classic material, which it is not. If you are considering buying this album, and you are not familiar with Uberzone, you should understand that he specializes in ultra crisp, clean, science fiction like breaks. He is probably a bit of a science fiction nut or something....I don't know for sure but that's how his music sounds. But Uberzone always represents super quality production. He has skills for sure. The quality of the tracks is up to the brim......quality noises, sounds, samples, composure. See, I believe that when he created this album he created it EXACTLY the way he wanted it to sound. You just have to step off in his mind to appreciate where he is coming from............."
4,One of his best,I can see where Stan got a lot of his material for the Holotropic Mind. Among being fairly repetitive of his other works it does have a good description of the wide range of Transpersonal type experiences as well as a pretty good description of his Holotropic Breathwork. Also describes Stan's BPM stages as does the Holotropic Mind.
4,Another warped set,"One of my two trays also arrived warped, as described by Bags and Sassy Electra previously. In my case, the weight of the correct try empty is not enough to flex the empty tray, but as soon as there's some food in it, or the top of the dehydrator is in place, the whole stack nestles down correctly. Don't know if this is a quality control problem or just that the plastic sets up a little differently each time. I'm happy with my set, in spite of this minor issue."
1,*** Just DON'T do it!!! ***,"If you are anthing like me, you like to buy refurbished products. I have bought many refurbished items, never had a serious issue with any of them. I think the folks that have not had an issue with this item are an execption. I thought I wouldn't have an issue. I ordered two at the same time. The first was broken right out of the box. The second seemed fine until I plugged it into charge. The instructions state you need to plug it into charge for 7 hours for a full charge. I had it plugged in for 24 hours & the red light never stopped blinking. That means that the battery was fully discharged. I never even got to try either one. They are both going back. I gave this item 1 star because I couldn't give it zero. I know it's tempting @ this price, resist. This has been more trouble than it's worth."
2,"There's a reason these are returned ... I mean, reconditioned","I ordered 3 products -- two to use, one to keep for parts. Unfortunately, not one of them is in good working order.One of the roombas we've knick-named ""Bubba"" -- it does not move between changes in floor surface (e.g., from a hardwood to a area rug). When we put it on the area rug, it will not move off it. This roomba worked 50 minutes before needing a charge.The other two roombas have no battery life. Each was charged initially for 24 hours. One worked 25 minutes before dying, the other worked 20 minutes. Battery life is supposed to be ""up to 120 minutes"" ... but one-sixth?I've concluded that there's a reason people return these. Now you know my reasons."
4,iRobot Roomba 4199 Vacuuming Robot,"Just the greatest little vacuum ever, does what it is suppose to do and my little Min Pin never gets tired of chaseing it around the house."
4,its good,"I usually prefer to just hand sweep the carpet. Im a relatively tidy person and dont see much need in a large upright vaccum. However, Ive heard alot about this amazing product and decided to try it. Not only was a thrilled with its preformance but i think it gives my dog a bit of a free work out as he enjoys chasing the Roomba. It has amazing sucking power for such a little thing. Also the bright color is easy to spot and hard to loose!"
1,battery died after 10 usages,battery died after 10 usages and the warranty already expired.won't buy such remanufactured roomba any more. the battery is a complete trash.
2,"This vacuum really ""Sucks"" (pun intended)","It's a novel idea to have a robot clean your house but it's more work than it's worth. First you have to ""Robot Proof"" the area to be vacuumed especially if you have a floor plan that is very open and doesn't have very defined boundaries. Then, it takes FOREVER to clean the same area I could do in 2 minutes with my upright vacuum! Then after it runs out of battery power and/or finishes the job you need to take it apart and clean it out exposing yourselft to all the junk you just vacuumed up! A nice idea but not very practical."
3,"poor support, maybe partly my fault","owned this for about a year. Worked reasonably well, as others have said, takes awhile to charge and needs prequent cleaning to remove hair, etc. Considering how much time I spent cleaning the unit(brush/hair, hair out of bearings, etc.), it would almost have been easier to run my regular vacuum instead. Unit stopped functioning, RMAd it back, company said would replace, and all I recieved back was a charger. Unfortunately, it was a few months before I could confer with them, and in the interim I lost my RMA/tracking number, and although they had my name address/serial number, they were unwilling/unable to do anything else for me. Dilemma now is whether to buy someone else's product or a new one of these(as they are now much cheaper) and since I still have a good invisible wall, battery, and charger. Strongly considering that(seen it at home depot here for $99)despite not being very happy with things, as I still do have these accessoires."
2,Makita 4-1/2 lacks power and speed,"This product is lite and easy to handle. But I am very disappointed in the lack of speed and power. I know it is a little battery powered saw, but I expected more from the saw and from a Makita product. Also, there's no built in chain oiler. If it would be a $50 to $100 product it would be fine. This is a big purchase for me at over $250. Not worth the money!!"
2,Not that good...,"I was intrigued by the notion of a lesbian writing from the perspective of a gay man. This served as my impetus for reading the book. All I can say is that Abha simply did not pull it off. The situations struck me as implausible, the story trite and contrived and the whole theme and premise was just boring - I mean seriously, the sex lives of Wall street types? In all fairness Abha did set upon a very difficult task in writing this, but the best she accomplished was a light, puffy book. If America were ready for gay themes I'd say look for this as a movie of the week. However, if your interest is good literature, give it a pass."
2,good try,"a really interesting and unique story that has a lot of potential but unfortunately falls a bit flat because the reader is never completely attached with any of the characters, let alone the main character. and, without this the reader can never fully appreciate the character's motivations (if there are any). you end up feeling like these people are self-indulgent messes with no depth. it's disappointing, because the story is unique and bold, and has a lot of potential. it's still worth a read because there isn't much like this out there."
3,What can be believed??,"I enjoyed reading this book, even though the content is difficult to comprehend with all of the horrors of Auschwitz/Birkenau and Bergen-Belsen. According to several orchestra members, a good portion of Fania's ""memoirs"" is inaccurate, which I think is a shame. This was brought to light in the book Alma Rose: From Vienna to Auschwitz. I would recommend reading both Playing for Time and Alma Rose: From Vienna to Auschwitz to get a better picture of what life was like for the orchestra. I was also very disappointed to read Fania's degrading names she used for the Polish prisoners, which sadly shows her racist views."
2,"From a country far,far away...","This toy is obviously from a place that doesn't speak English. Its voice recognition software is terrible. It interacts more with my big-screen monitor than with people.Reasonable quality hardware, clever idea, poor execution."
4,Star Wars R2-D2 Interactive Astromech Droid,the Star Wars R2-D2 Interactive Astromech Droid was a big hit that brought back a lot of great fun old memories.
4,Dino lunch bag,"Very large oversized bag, unique design, no thermos / water bottle - just the bag. Will hold lunch and snack with room to spare. Has long (adjustable / detachable) strap, hand carry or over the shoulder."
4,Good Deal,"I bought this for my son, but he insisted on this platinum controller, because so many of the other controllers fail easily or prematurely. He seems to be very happy and he has had no problems."
2,so little room...,so little room...for the price...I bought it online to beat the hustle and bustle of school shopping. Right after school started I found tons more for less and more space. It's the car pack now...
2,WARNING: Not creme-de-la-creme Paris chillout.,"I first became addicted to chillout music when I heard Cafe del Mar 8 playing at a record store in NYC. Since then, I've become an avid collector and somewhat of an afficianado.I bought ""Paris Lounge"" based on its very positive reviews. But compared to Cafe del Mar, Hotel Costes, and the magnificent Buddha Bar series, this collection does not make the grade. There are some good samplings here, but all in all, it is uneven, badly mixed, and often way too weird to be even listenable, let alone enjoyable."
2,Esperaba más,"Me decepcionó un poco. La premisa es interesante pero la trama y los personajes no lo son tanto. Por momentos me pareció aburrida y sosa. En ningún momento llegas a interesarte por los protagonistas. Me parece inferior a otras novelas de thriller histórico como las de Dan Brown, Javier Sierra o Matilde Asensi. Calificación: 2/5"
5,Great all around ointment,"This product if great for many ailments; (i.e.) fever blisters, nasal congestion, lung congestion. I have also found it works great to temporarialy alleviate arthritis pain. Just rub it on the joint and see if it works for you as well as it does for me."
3,It is not what you see,"The picture that you are showing is different from the product that you are selling. The neo-synephrine night time relief spray was not what you sent me, you sent some neo-synephrine for havy congestion."
5,Short is Sweet,"For those of us who ""trained up"" on Yalom, this book is an entirely pleasant and very useful refresher, regardless of your primary therapeutic orientation. I now enjoy using his brief missives with my own trainees, as he is the best at succiently illustrating the use of the relationship within sessions. Plus, it's always comforting to read his accounts of being irritated with, and irritating, his clients when I've gotten into a sticky place with any of mine. Normalizing, humanizing, refreshing."
3,Good,"Yalom is helpful but at times settles into the grandfatherly role too easily, failing to interrogate his own beliefs as thoroughly as he should. Bad therapists could take some of his good ideas and use them to unhelpful purposes because the vagueness of the writing at times borders on sentimentality. A more rigorous approach would have avoided this and allowed Yalom's common sense a deeper coherence."
2,Review For Ignition Only,"Whether with the Babies, Bad English or solo, Waite pretty much made the same indistinguishable corporate pabulum. This particular album sounds so eighties it seems almost to be a joke, but it was most definitely real includes the radio anthem 'Change', if you don't remember it, fear not, you ain't missin nuthin."
2,Book offered nothing new,"Unfortunately, this book wasted my time. I learned nothing that I didn't already know. I had read good reviews and was completely let down. Perhaps it was the annoyance of the reader's voice. I won't even pass this one along to my friends."
2,Not Helpful,"A worthless book for the most part. It's written to administrators, not the average user, so there is no help on actually using the software.And if it's written to administrators, all it covers is the obvious that can easily be found in the documentation or discerned by the average IT pro.So I'm not sure who this book is for."
1,Good Music Poor Quality CD,I returned this CD many of the recordings were of poor quality and others skipped.
1,Not for everyone,"Just wanted to let people know that this product is not for everyone. As a longtime allergy sufferer and, therefore, a longtime corticosteriod (Flonase) user I tried Nasalcrom when I was changing health plans and could not get my regular prescription. Not only did Nasalcrom make my allergy symptoms worse, it gave me a very irritating full body rash. This is a fairly rare but documented possible side effect. I am happy for all the people out there that Nasalcrom helps but I wanted to inform all that just because this is an OTC product does not mean it is completely safe and foolproof. It can and does affect some people negatively. Back on Flonase now and I am happy and allergy symptom free."
2,recomendations too expensive,"while this is a helpful guide as discribing what to do, where to go, it is not helpful in where to stay.The review of the previous edition slammed it for the same reason, I thought that the would be revised.The lodging recomendations are for more expensive places then frommmers is known for."
4,Kiwiland is the best,"I have not traveled to New Zealand for almost 5 years, so I was looking for a book to update me on where to go and what to do. Also, I plan to drive for the first time in that country. Frommers really gives me lots of things to do and see. Thanks, Frommers! P.S.I love your books no matter where I travel!"
1,My goodness,"This book was terrible, unless you are a child or a fantsy freak. Who cares about these moles with personalities that are as bland as any you'll find these days? How someone can praise this book is beyond me. It is one of only three books that I decided wasn't worth my time to finish reading, and that was after I had struggled to get through the first three or four hundred pages. The boredom just got too much."
5,Aliens,Mr. Thompson makes a lot of great points in this book. Very structured and well thought out theories. I thought personally that it is an incredible book.
1,pokyman,"Annie Duke is the best femail poker player today, so I thougt I might get some nice ideas from this DVD about Online poker and maybe I could learn something new. I was very disapointed about it, it is very basic, and all this DVD is about seem to be advertisment for the poker site Ultimate Bet, did I learn something useful? No.so what did I learn?1.I learned how to download the Ultimate Bet software.2.I learned how I should do to deposit money to Ultimate Bet.3.I learned that there is s&g;'s and tournaments on Ultimate Bet.3.I learned that I should be a tight player online,nothing about how to play and what to play, and thats about it.this is a scam DVD, don't buy it."
1,dehydrator screens,"They sent the wrong ones, which I now have to pay the return shipping on. Not happy!"
1,Give up this book for SAP certification,"Perhaps I paid too much expectation on this book. I thought it will give you a lot of simulated questions to simulate SAP certificate exam, but it turns out only to give you a brief explaination about SAP NOT for CERTIFICATION. I am very disappointed for this book. Besides, the answer for each question is far from the reality. That is to say, in the SAP certificate exam, NO ONE IS GOING TO WRITE 3 OR 4 LINES OF ENGLISH SENTENCES TO ANSWER EVEN A SIMPLE QUESTION. FOR WHAT? As most of people who are interested in SAP certificate exam know that SAP certificate exam have most questions in multiple choices. The SAP certificate exam is to test people's professional knowledge NOT to test the level of English writting."
1,Don't ever think on buying this book,"The cover of the book says: ""Comprehensive test preparation for FI...etc."" The FI module is covered in the book in only 10 pages while SAP needs 4 huge binders for that. Is absolutely impossible to replace the binders in 10 bad written pages. The questions are totally different those there are in the exam. The author doesn't know anything about SAP. Do not waste your money. Is a totally lousy book."
1,Stating the obvious,This book describes SAP R/3 modules one can get certified for. Nothing you cannot get from the SAP website and nothing that will add to your test preparation. I am so sad for the trees that had to fall for this 4 lbs. tome to come to be.
5,Certification Gold,After reviewing many different certification resources--I was very pleased to see the enormous detail and information provided in Miller's book.There is a real wealth of information that forms the literal cornerstone of the SAP Certification process.It is truly an essential SAP resource.
3,I found the NasalCrom very easy to use. ...,"I found the NasalCrom very easy to use. It works well for me and my traditional hay fever and grass allergies. It kept my itching, sore throat, and runny-eyes symptoms away. I'd use this for my mild to moderate allergy symptoms."
3,Exo-Terra Fogger,"This unit works fine, but you have to keep the water level sensor clear of oxidation. I use a pencil point (minus the graphite) to scrub the small rectangle of mineral build-up. The well water we have is rich in copper, so I get a green-blue oxidation every 2-3 weeks. Vinegar sounds like a good idea, I'll try that next week. The cord holds up well to hermit crabs' claws climbing up it. I am buying a second one to start a tropical terrarium with. I use mine on a day/night aka wave-maker timer that has programmable 15 minute intervals. I use 15 minutes on, 30 minutes off."
1,Horrible,Do not buy this peice of crap.... The fogger doesnt put much fog out after a few weeks... i tried the recommended soaking in viniger to clean it and it doesnt work... It also heats the water up pretty warm and will heat your tank and increase algea activity. I hated this thing and stopped using it after a month. what a waist of money.
2,Does not last long,"I bought one of these to put in my snakes tank on a timer. It worked well for a couple weeks, then stopped working completely. I cleaned the little disc and soaked the unit in a vinegar/water solution, but it still didn't work. I ended up throwing it away and wasting my money, not sure what the problem was.If you can get this to work and stay working, snakes seem to love it. Mine liked to sit near it when it was on and drink the water droplets that collected around her mouth."
5,"sphaghetti sauce, hamburger...","For pasta you need:1) dry ground meat (very lean hamburger or ground turkey is healthier but probably less tasty).2)tomatoe sauce (Ragu, or healthier homemade).Any except greasy sauces like alfredo or with meatballs will not dry well.3) dry pasta: It's already done for you, the pastas found in the supermarket.I just follow youtube videos using these fruit roll sheets.----------------------hamburger:""Dehydrating with Tinny and Sue""[...]""Dehydrating part two!! with Sue and Tinny""[...]----------------------Ragu sauce:""deydrating Spaghetti sauce""[...]------------------------------------What could be easier?"
5,Great pen for a newbie (like me),"I didn't use a fountain pen in more than 20 years. After reading posts on the fountain pen network I decided to buy the Lamy Safari, and I am very happy that I did it.The nib doesn't scratch at all, it didn't take me long to get used to it.If I have to make a complaint, I suppose it would be for the width of the nib. I am used to very fine pens, and the extra fine that was on the pen is not that fine, actually. However, I love it, I have used it in the past two months and writing is a pleasure again!"
3,"Great content, horrible packaging","For some reason the creators of this documentary thought it would be a good idea to package the DVD in 100% post-consumer recycled material. As a result, it looks and feels of extremely poor quality, and the packaging will not withstand the slightest bit of wear and tear.If they wanted to improve my opinion of post-consumer goods they colossally failed.The quality of the actual content of the DVD is excellent, however.When I buy a DVD, I expect to be able to store it with my other DVDs, but in this case, I'm going to need to throw the original packaging away and find an actual plastic case so that it can go on the shelf without being squished."
5,Excellent,All I can say is that it was all that I expected; an excellent presentation box and great material.
5,Excellent product!!,Excellent product!! The serie and the packaging are perfect!I'm very happy with my purchase. I live in Argentina and i can't buy this product in my country.
1,Rome Season 1 & 2,"The series is 5 star but the DVD was defective as per comments on it's return - spontaneously reverted to English subtitles (overly LARGE and distracting subtitles at that). Has interfered with our enjoyment of the series as it was a birthday gift. Return policy fair, but has been delayed due to need for back order.Dianne Davis"
4,Awesome with a Great Story,"Rome was a great series to watch. The story, settings, feel of it was just amazing. My only knock on it would be the 2nd season. After watching the first season, I was so excited to see the second. While watching the second, I felt as though the season was rushed (I guess because they knew it was the last season and had to get all of that into 1). Other than that, the series is amazing."
5,A classic,"I watched the series on HBO several years ago and really was surprised at the quality of the acting and direction of each episode. The acting is superb and the story line is engaging. There is more drama in this particular series compared to let's say, Spartacus blood and sand. Both are good series however. I think the series portrays the themes of the times and really captures the politics of the day. Glad I live in modern times than at the time of the series. Worth every penny."
1,Two Seasons Rip Off,"I must agree with the first viewer. What in the world are you thinking? I have been a staunch Amazon customer for years, but I am appalled that you would think anyone would pay $49.99 for Season One and $49.99 for Season Two OR $179.99 for BOTH. Are the discs gold plated? What train of thought went behind this? Please say that it was an obvious error and that you meant to say $79.99 for both Seasons."
2,Tin Foil Hat Book,"In 1953 Holt, Rienhart and Winston published this title as part of their hardbound science fiction line geared towards young readers. Lester del Rey writing as Kenneth Wright was the author. I recall reading several of these Holt science-fiction juveniles in the 1950's and they inspired my lifelong interest in astronomy and space exploration. I wish I could recommend this title to new readers but what were once novel speculations of possible future events and discoveries reads today like so much hocus-pocus and outright nonsense. The passage of 50 years has not treated this book kindly. One saving grace is a subplot concerning the ageless question of either war or peace with the Aliens From Outer Space. For the dedicated fan of speculative fiction this is a classic example of 1950's science fiction with the emphasis on fiction."
3,"Calculus and Its Applications, Eighth Edition","Probably I did not read the description of this book carefully, that is why not what I expected. Anyway, the transaction was very pleasant!!!"
4,Very good for a beginner taking calculus,"Its examples and explanations are very good. It contains the essentials of Calculus and good applications in many fields, e.g. biology, economics, etc."
5,Calculus and Its Applications,"Great very fast response, valued customer's demand, no fuss, hope to expect similar service in future Thanks. you are Five star."
5,Searched for Years,"I first read this poem when I worked for Barnes & Noble in 1989 and it was out of print. Tried as I might I couldn't get a copy. Today it just popped in my head and unlike then, I now have the internet at my fingertips and I am going to puchase this and will keep it forever. I am a black woman is the most powerful words I've ever read and it has never left me now 23 years later. I do feel renewed. This couldn't have come back into my life at a better time."
5,Terrific resource for teachers!,"This is a terrific resource for teachers. As a 4th grade teacher, I use this book as a framework to locate picture books to share with my class that deal with people who have disabilities. Great reference tool!"
1,still haven't received my refund,I am still waiting for my refund it has been 2 months since I sent it back
5,Makes delicious family treats!,"I recently purchased a Nesco Food dehydrator and got these fruit roll-up sheet too. They are wonderful to dry fruits for delicious fruit roll ups. We had some apples and cranberries frozen from our recent harvest and this combination made a really good snack, my whole family loves them. We also tried plums which turned out very tasty and tart which is also a nice change. These sheets will quickly pay for themselves as we are using them frequently! The directions say you should spray the sheet before putting your fruit on to dry, well I did spray two and forgot to spray two, and all came off of the tray quickly and easily."
3,beware - there are different sizes,"The item is fine, but doesn't fit my Nesco dehydrator! Can't tell from the writeup which machines this is for. Buyer beware. I have the ""Nesco FD-75PR 700-Watt Food Dehydrator"" and it's smaller diameter than these trays."
4,A product that does what it advertises,"This is my first experience with dehydrators but I wanted to make Deer Jerky so bad that I bought this one after looking a lot thorugh the different models. This is a basic, no frills model but it seemed to do the job very nicely. I do not know what the more expensice models give you but I doubt if much more. The meat was dehydrated in 5-7 hours and it came out perfect.Negatives: The fan is loud and could be heard from other rooms. A nice feature to have would have been a built in timer instead of having to buy an external one."
3,just don't fit,"The clean a screen does not fit my FD-50 properly. I have other screens that work well, but these are just a little too big. They wrinkle when placed into my trays. I cannot find another product at a price I can afford, so I will either leave them wrinkled, or trim them to size later."
2,Not what I thought,I thought that the screens would be close enough weave to not let applesauce slip through. It just made a big mess. They were nice however for the smaller pieces of carrots and radishes that I dry.
4,Awesome read!,"This book just starts off on the ""right foot""..it keeps your attention from the beginning to the end."
1,Be Careful,"Was not as described. Looked to be a completely different charger. The picture depicted several cell phone end attachments and it only came with 1 - the WRONG one. We only paid .50 so, we're not that put off. Just sad to see deceiving ads on Amazon.com"
2,Think twice,"Don't buy this clock radio unless you have seen it in a darkened room and are okay with it. My wife and I have owned digital alarm clocks since the early 1970's and neither of us have had a clock that is so amazingly luminescent, but practically unreadable as this one. Our bedroom is now lit up as if we left the TV set and Christmas tree lights on and yet we can't read the numerals without approaching the clock to within a few inches. Yes, the sound quality is excellent. The buttons, however, are incredibly small with no differentiation in size or texture for preset stations, power, tuning, time adjustment or anything else (a real problem in the dark, especially since the time display causes shadows across everything else). Also, there isn't any way to program different workweek and weekend settings (there are simple Alarm 1 and Alarm 2 buttons, but nothing more sophisticated). This clock radio is a terrible waste of money."
4,Great product,I have owned the Cambridge SoundWorks 730 for a few months now and I love it. The subwoofer delivers a nice deep bass; the overall sound quality is great for a box this small; the design is gorgeous; the buttons are laid out really well; every button turns on the system which is a nice convenient feature; the compact size fits perfectly in my kitchen; the credit card sized remote can perform every function on the box.
4,The game that will save your relationship,"My girlfriend loves it. It's probably what keeps her from leaving me because I'm stuck to my PS2 during ""QT"" moments. Guys, get this game and sit the little lady down and she won't hate that little box under the TV so much anymore."
2,Disappointing purchase,"I was not impressed with the product at all. I bought it to flow H2O through the small fountain in my tree frog set up. The pump worked a day or two and then just burned out. I even made sure it was clean of cricket debris. I don't know if it is just this particular pump or the product as a whole, but I am looking for a different brand."
2,Doesn't fit!,"This is advertised for a playYard, but it is WAY too big. Simply doesn't fit - certainly not snugly as it needs to. Had to return it."
3,Incorrect Measurements,"The dimensions listed in the description are incorrect and unhelpful. Reading the reviews that this cover fits the Graco Pack n'Play, I went to an external website and found more information that listed the dimensions as 27"" x 37."" Maybe this will help others who are interested in purchasing this item."
4,Group Work Review,Good book with some general specifics that would be useful in running group(s). The many social workers who compiled this collection brought relevant factors and pieces of history to the different populations they wrote about.
4,The easiest way to make beef jerky!,"I bought the Nesco American Harvest Beef Jerky Kit because my family found it daunting to make it the conventional way with steak, marinade and all the mess. My two teenage sons, who always look for the easiest way to do anything, found this to be the most convenient (and tastiest) way to make great beef jerky that is a big hit with all of their friends. You can make different sizes and even add your own condiments to add a little extra zest. Just be sure to keep an eye on your dehydrator every few hours or some jerky may come out drier."
5,Tasty,I bought this kit and like everyone else I was very skeptical about making beef jerky from ground beef but it ended up tasting really good and everyone that tasted it liked it. I suggest that if you want to make some jerky using strips of meat I highly recommend using the cure and spices and mixing it with the strips of meat. It comes out great and I absolutely love it. This jerky gun has it's good points but overall it makes tasty treats. Try and see for yourself that it isn't that bad after all.
2,a couple good songs,"first off i mean no offence to the taste of the other reviewers who gave it such good ratings you obviously have a different taste than me in the music arena, but i bought the cd and feel i'm entittled to an opinion. if you have heard or seen the video for ""open your eyes"" don't buy the cd if that's what you expect it all to be like. i made that mistake and paid dearly for it($15.99). however i will admit ""lord of the boards"" is a great song."
5,For Gamecube? Really?,"When I first saw the Ghost Recon game for Gamecube on Amazon, I was excited, but also skeptical. I realize that writing a ""review"" for a game that I know nothing about at the moment is stupid, I can't help but hope that it does come out. Gamespot, IGN, and EGM all contradict the release of this game for the Cube; but Epinions, EB games, and of course, Amazon all show that the release of this game is indeed quite realistic. I can't wait to play the game of the year on my console for even more fun gameplay. It would certainly be heartbreaking if the game failed to come out. *fingers crossed*"
4,Great series,I just loved the series when it aired on HBO and am glad to get all of the episodes in one box set.BUT...they could have done more as far as special features...but overall a great buy!
5,So good but I hate it ended,"The series is so good it makes me want to tweet/facebook Todd and beg him to finish the series on dvd. Some episodes did upset me because Spawn just pouted and acted like an emo kid and i amazed that spawn was allowed to sulk/be emo for so long when the devil/clown did nothing about it but it is a terrific series. I paid $10 for it and got it in 2 days, watching season 2/3 as of this review. I am sad I know I am reaching the few remaining episodes."
5,Bring the band back,Just giving you props for a great CD. Too bad you guys are not together. Dave great seeing you in DC at AU again. Hope to see ya band play again.
1,Cliche,Awful regurgitation of whats wrong with this scene. very VERY trite lyrics. i wouldnt buy this cd...only positive: the singer has a fairly good voice. music isn't anything to write home about.sounds like a new found glory demo from when jordan was 12.
4,"Do not judge by genre, lest it be merely a follower.","I normally don't bother to do anything past rating albums, but another review that rated this lowly because it was missing elements of drum n' bass missed the point. Ben Neill has never been drum and bass, though it influences his work. Ben Neill is an experimentalist, in the sense of exploring his own path. All I have to say is, if you're looking for groundbreaking jazz-fusion/electronic music, Ben Neill is where it's at. This is his most accessible album, primed to bring his style closer to the dancefloor. If you're looking for textbook dnb that won't disturb your comfort zone, head to the Dieselboy section."
4,"It's not bad, mature with a blending of styles and textures.","I was quite impressed upon first listen, and I think the more I listen, the more I like it. There is so much tight blending of sounds that there is always something new to be heard. One criticism though is that many of the songs sound very alike, except for different rythmns and titles. But I'd still recommend listening to it, he's definately not an amature!"
3,???? 'n' bass,"I bought this cd expecting to find something unusual in it. But it is the same old story containing the same elements, except some high moments like ""dark gift"", ""shirt waste"" and ""goldbug"". But the album really misses the ""drum"" part of its genre."
3,Underrated,"This is the most complete collection of the hits of a greatly underrated singer/songwriter/producer of the 1970s and 1980s. We remember these songs; we also need to remember the man who recorded them (and who passed on earlier this year). -- janderso, Olean, NY"
5,"""A sprited Romance""","Michael Caine and Maggie Smith create the charm, and ironies, in this tale of two couples. As so often, light entertainment reminds us of realities we may have forgotten, making us happy to respect of our own, and others', adventures in romance."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,"I was losing a pound a week without any supplements, so my exercise and diet were not the problem. I took this for a week and had no results whatsover... added the 3rd pill in and GAINED 4 lbs in 5 days!! Needless to say, back to the store it went for the unconditional refund. Only problem with that is, they charge you 25% to take it back! FREAKING RIP OFF!! BUY THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK, IT DID NOTHING FOR ME BUT COST ME MONEY!"
4,The best combo I've tried for FAST weight loss results...............,"This is the most effective weight loss success I've everr had in such a short ammount of time.Great for ""Brides to be""!"
1,Besure to read all reviews,"A friend had me look at this and as I was scrolling through the reviews. If you are thinking of buying this product...don't. Go take a look at the review from July 16, 06 by Kitty V. and the review on July 26th, 06 by Tammy R. They write the same exact thing, the only difference is the names, state and date. Well one does give a 4 and the other a 5 rating. Can you say scaaammmm! LOL Try this at your own risk...I would trust the poorer ratings over the good ones on this one for sure."
1,There's 20 bucks I'll never get back...,"I sat in amazement during the first 20 minutes of this at how bad it was, then watched the final hour hoping for a miracle that never came. Made by pseudo-intellectuals completely full of themselves, the film begins on an awkward ""after Tom left Asylum Records"" note rather than tracing his full career, and goes out of its' way again and again to point out Tom's spouse Kathleen Brennan's influence on his work to what purpose I cannot fathom."
2,Brook Benton sound,"I was very disappointed by this CD. I expected this cd to be rich with sound but it was not. I understand that this album was turned into a CD, but somewhere along the way, the clarity of sound was lost. this cd sound muffled."
2,Ripoff!!!,"Not worth the money, its only fifteen minutes lond and is not a very indpeth look into the subject matter."
4,Excellent Customer Service,"I do not care for this particular model, and prefer Delta brand better, but we had a Moen that went bad in our kitchen. I simply contacted them via their website, sent them a picture because I had no receipt, and they sent a complete new faucet. I was very satisfied with Moen keeping to their promise: ""Moen - Buy it for looks. Buy it for life."""
5,This is it!,"I've got a Honda CB125S. If I'm going to service it, this is my only option.It is a good service manual. No problems with it so far. Well written and clear-- at least to someone who's been into service manuals in the past."
3,"Honda 100-350Cc Ohc Singles, 1969-1982 (M315)",Good overview for basic rebuild. Trouble shooting when the rebuild does not work as planned could be improved upon. Some of the pictures do not clearly show the details of areas worked on.
5,This Band...,"...reminds me of the Rolling Stones. Understand they are not copying the stones, they are just good with the style."
3,"Great DVD, Great Music, Poor Mastering","I'll confine myself to sound quality, since it is rarely mentioned in reviews. Around 2004, Garcia-Fons changed from having fantastic, dynamic mastering to loud dynamically compressed mastering. The result is that Entremundo (2004) and Arcoluz (2005) have very little punch, and a rather monotonous volume level. The dynamics in the music have been gutted. The sound of the instruments has also been degraded by the process of compression, limiting, etc. I would recommend not getting these two disks (except for the dvd); and instead getting Alborea (1995), Legendes (1996), and/or Fuera (1999). Those disks are of top notch quality and will provide you with maximum listening pleasure.PS: if you want to know more about loudness & dynamic compression go to wikipedia and look up ""loudness war"". It's a shame that it has infected acoustic music like Garcia-Fons'. C'est la vie."
3,Beautiful to the eye; harsh to the ear,"This is a DVD release of an item that Kultur has had in their VHS catalog. There are reviews of the VHS version, here on this website, which cover the excellent visuals, acting and setting. So I will only add that the sound has not been improved enough to be satisfactory. The Gergiev DVD is still the best way for general enjoyment of the opera. There is a video version under Haitink, which I think is a better performance than the Gergiev, but unfortunately it has not had a commercial release."
3,Missing axed,"ABC has cancelled ""Missing"" as of May 11th. The last episode ends on a cliff-hanger, so I can't recommend it - at least those who also hate cliff-hangers."
2,Don't know why it was canceled but know it should have been:,"The entire essence of this show - which had potential - was essentially hide the McGuffin, lie about the MCGuffin and run the supposedly brilliant agent just keep running around, worrying about the past and never getting the MOST important things. And,it kept the audience expecting exactly that happy. Ane did it on a bid budget. Wheee.(Were it not for the wasted cast, I would likely have not been as annoyed (many I could care less (well, actually could not care any less) about because they are apparently there to fill open time slots with the same set of characters doing the same boring things. Maybe if I didn't remember the television of the 50s/60s/.................................."
2,no thanks,"I was a HUGE metal fan back in the 80's....but i never understood the appeal of this band. Their songs are mediocre at best....lyrically speaking. I realize they had a loyal fan base for a while....and they sold alot of albums for the year or two they were popular....but i could spend the next hour rattling off band after band from that era that were MUCH better!Hell...there were second and third tier bands that didn't get HALF the attention that these guys got.....who were alot better in my opinion! (i.e. HELLOWEEN, OMEN, ANGEL WITCH, CROSSFIRE)"
3,These are ok,"These are not made as well as cable ties I have acquired in the past, but they'll do. I will not order this brand again, unless I have no choice, but I think they are ok. I had one pop its hold for some reason - meaning i had tied it tight and I was rotating it around and something popped. I thought it had just outright broken, but the cable was still intact - just the ""tie"" part evidently had something break in it because it would no longer lock on the cable running through it. This only happened once, but it was one of the first 3 ties I used, and I have only used 6-7 of them so far."
5,Simply the best!,"I found this product at random at a pharmacy and was never able to find it again.Amazon.com came handy :-) The delivery was super fast and the product is just the best!When Winter times come, my nose gets very dry and this aloe vera nasal gel keeps it moisturized."
5,PERFECT!,"This product is perfect in the way it works and in how it is priced! I have a chronic syndrome that involves daily treatment. Some products actually burn the tissue. BUT, Ayr Saline Nasal Gel with Aloe not only soothes the tissue but keeps it soft, as well. Now that I can purchase it in a pack of 4 makes it even better. I became a member of Subscribe and Save amd am able to buy the 4 pack at a much cheaper price AND it is automatically sent to me at regular intervals ... no more last minute trips to the drugstore!! Gotta love that!!"
5,I love it!,"I have a very sensitive nose and sensitive skin. My respiratory therapist recommended this product to me. My nose was getting sore from my Bipap machine. This is the answer to my prayers! It works wonderfully. There is a medicinal scent when you first put it on, but it quickly goes away. This has saved my nose!!!!!"
2,It BURNS-- made my dry nose WORSE.,"This product burns like rubbing alcohol when used inside of the nostril. (it says on the box it can be used in this way.) I enjoy using a neti pot for my dry painful nose... so I though this would be a good way to help my nose retain moisture. Forget about it! As soon as I applied it I at first felt relief ... but then slowly it started to burn.. next thing I knew I had a horrible burning nose, headache and pain between my eyes. I used the neti pot a 2nd time to wash it out... and thankfully that worked.Never again."
3,This game goes down low!,"You are the Defender, saving the human race from weird Manti aleins.... Yeah, that saying could really get people into buying this game, trust me and play the regular one on the internet instead.The graphics aren't too good, there is animated blood in there too but it stinks. There isn't any music in the levels unless you call silence music. The sound is sort of irritating because there isn't any music to accompany it. The only reason I gave it a three and not a one is because I had a little fun, but the fun dies out when you realize there are only 6 stages in the advanced version.This game is short and I recommend it to hardcore arcade playersfrom ages 9-50. Others would hate it like my sister...."
3,Only give it a three because of a big screw up........,"I have been waiting all summer to get season five of Silk Stalkings and it finally arrived today, from Amazon.I began reading the episode summaries on the dvd cases and realized that they sounded familiar to me.....well, the reason being, the summaries on the back are for season four not season five (they are exactly the same as the one's on my season four dvd cases)so, whoever designed the packaging really SCREWED UP BIG TIME!!!!!However, it doesn't take away from the final season with Rita and Chris and how sad it is to see them leave the show.Hopefully Anchor Bay will fix this mistake on the sets, I sent them an email this morning."
2,Small tops.........,For these to be queen size........they were VERY small at the top with no stretch in the material. I couldn't wear them.
2,Sadly out of Date!!!!,"This book provides you with 120 different decks, and gets your creative juices flowing. However, I started Magic three years ago, but I still don't have even a quarter of the cards that are in these decks! This is way, way out of date, and made with cards that you can't get anymore, unless you already have them. So if you started Magic after 1998,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Full Scale Knowledge Management,"This is a premier book on knowledge management--a definite must read. Although it's a bit pricey and not in main stream distribution, please note that Tom Davenport is the co-editor. The book provides an inside perspective on how Siemens, a 400,000 person global company has scaled KM to be both part of their business practices and their business model. Since they operate in over 190 countries, it's easy to see why the communities of practice concept would be so appealing to them. Given the limited amount of available literature related to communities of practice, the how-to chapter about communities in this book by itself makes the book a must read. As you read about the KM work at Siemens you can get a good sense of how KM will eventually reside permanently in the main stream of management practice. I have collected quite a bit of the KM literature and would place this in a top ten read list."
1,Don't waste your money or your time,"When I saw this item I got so excited, and when I saw the average review out of 24 was 4 stars, I didn't even blink. But when I got this book today, I was extremely disappointed. The book is about 4"" x 6"" and has 84 pages of mostly white space. The type is so big you could practically read it from 40 feet away.... and, if you're a huge Trekkie like me, you'll be sorely disappointed to learn it's not anywhere near the complete list of 285 rules.... but random selections of maybe 50 of them. It's a waste of a good tree. Thankfully, Amazon's customer service is top-notch and they are more than willing to pay for the return and issue a refund."
4,Funny and Quick,"Great book. Took it to be a quick, funny expansion to include all the rules and it does just that. This book is absolutely made just so one can laugh about the ridiculous rules that are obviously unethical. The price is also right as this book is more like a quick qift. It was the perfect gift for a Father's Day. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the content of the book; it's good, it's funny, but not five star great"
1,Cheap Nokia charger - you get what you pay for...,"Got this charger for 99 cents and I shouldn't be surprised. When I plug it in the phone eventually shuts off and I have to pull the battery out and put it back in to turn the phone on again. Plus, it didn't even charge the battery like it was supposed to. The only plus was the price... =("
3,Not really the Best Of...,"Motorhead is possibly my favorite rock band. But this collection was not chosen well. The band's early years are covered well, but the still-in-print No Remorse is a much better collection of the early years. This collection skimps on the last 12 years worth of Motorhead, with only one selection each (and never the best) from fan favorite albums like 1916, Sacrifice and Snake Bite Love. Space is also wasted on a track by Girlschool (covering a Motorhead song) and a song by leader Lemmy's previous band, Hawkwind. (They were great but the track doesn't fit this collection.)If you want a sampling of Motorhead, No Remorse covers the first 8 years well. To get a sample of the later years, the best choice might be the live album, Everything Louder than Everything Else."
3,Not my favorite compilation from a metal group,"Just before I bought this I found an special version of Overkill with some bonus tracks. I expected this disc as a complement for that amazing special edition of my favorite Motorhead disc, but it was disaponting. From my point of view, it doesn't have some of the great songs like ""Don't let dady kiss me"" and more. Besides this includes Motorhead's version played for other groups, wasn't a Motorhead compilation? Not a good compilation of this cutting edge metal group."
1,Panty Hose,The Round the Clock panty hose did not seem to be of the same quality that I have purchased in the past from department stores. The panty seams pulled almost at once. I will not buy this product again.
4,DA GAME,I Have played some of this game It is Graphically beautiful and It has a decent story line I Played the import so it was in Japanese but I kinda got what was going on so Dont go soley by what I say But I reccommend This.FOR MORE INFO CHECK OUT MY SITE AT ANGELFIRE.COM/GAMES2/FinalFantasyVII/Index.html Thanks
1,Poop-Squad hits the pot,"A dirty poo feast for poo eaters. Don't waste your money on this sh*t, buy tp instead if you want to handle some poo. Poop blasting fun if your into diggin on poo."
5,Classic Metal,"This is classic metal music. The guys from Panzer have put together a great follow up to the last album, Thane to the Throne. The guitar work and vocals are great and the music is in classic metal fashion.If you like metal pick up this album and Thane to Throne and you won't be disapointed."
5,Wish More Guys Were This Creative,"Steve has ideas to make EVERY situation you might find yourself in romantic... A fast, fun read!"
5,best straightening gel ever,"I have used this straightener for 12 years. Althouth difficult to find, it is worth the search. I am so excited to find it through Amazon. I have wild frizzy hair and I use this product with biosilk's silk therapy for smooth hair without greasiness or heaviness."
2,Swimming pool nasal spray,"This nasal spray feels harsh on this inside of my nostrils. On top of that, I have the swimming pool smell in my nostrils for hours after its use. Does get my nostrils clean though."
2,Disappointing,"Usually I love Rough Guide products but this time I was sorely disappointed. I bought this phrasebook in a store in Oaxaca, Mexico where it was needed because few people speak any English. I speak some Spanish but needed some help. Every time I went to the mini-dictionary for help, it wasn't forthcoming. When my kid needed the Spanish word for pancake syrup, this book was useless, both in the dictionary and in the food guide. (btw it's maple, mop-lay). Every other word I also tried to look up, common words, were missing as well. The menu guide was especially annoying because it was ONLY in Spanish with English translations, instead of both ways. And it didn't cover the entire country's cuisine, only certain regions, there was no Oaxacan cuisine in there at all. If I'd had time, I would have returned it and bought another. I was sorely missing the pocket dictionary I used to have that seemed to have every word in Spanish I ever needed!"
4,sweet book,love this old school book and it is a great way to get an overall knowledge of ones bike. On the other hand it could not help me with my first two problems. Still a great read for someone who wants to get a deeper understanding of bike maintenance.
1,Disappointing,"I am always on the look out for a vanilla body oil and was very excited to find this, I figured for the price it had to be awesome. It isn't. The scent is very faint and my legs were flaking right after applying. I will not be purchasing this again."
4,Real History,"I learned of this while on an African-American Historical tour in NH. I didn't know that they had real history there. I immediately purchased this film and watched it. Even though this story took place many decades ago, the story is still real today. Folks are passing to ""mask"" who they really are. I plan to share it during our weekly movie matinee during Black History Month. I recommend this if you like history and black and white films."
1,My Opinion = Two Thumbs Down!,I purchased this game to add to the racing fun of the GT3 bundle with my PS2. I was sorely dissapointed with F1 from the graphics to the game play. First I thought it was just GT3 overshadowing the game but after time I realized that in my opinion the game is not worth keeping. Sold it on Ebay for cheap.
4,Couldn't put it down.,"The longer I read it, the more I just didn't want to stop. I never understood why S.T. loved this shrew of a woman. but the writing is fantastic and has made me a new fan of Ms. Kinsale's books. Next!"
3,Its ok,"Its a good story and the characters are interesting. I just though it moved a bit slow, especially at the beginning. Once it got going things picked up but there was a lot going on as well and at times it could be hard to follow. It was fun though seeing some interesting characters from history pass though. And I was fairly happy with the ending, although at times I couldnt explain how it got there. I will read another of her books though and see how it goes."
4,complete role reversal,"She is cynical and tormented and strong. He is romantic and gentle and loyal. The swap of the typical run of the mill romance characterisations make this a compelling read. As usual, Ms Kinsale delivers something not only special, but unique. Can't wait for Allegreto's story!"
1,sound like rock,This is the wackest CD they ever put out.you might like if you ain't Black.They did'nt get tight until Kingpin skinny pimp came cause he change they style that devil rap was WACK!!
5,Amazing,"This CD should not be just limited to southern rap audiences. In all seriousness, this is one of the best albums I've heard to date. I've been a rap fan for close to 10 years now, and this is by far one of the best albums ever. Put this on your collection shelf next to Pac, Biggie, and Big L. This would've gone down as a classic with more publicity.All the songs are amazing in origionality and lyrical talent. The beats are incredible. They were definately before their time. Go buy the album NOW! Don't wait...as a matter of fact stop downloading the songs on Kazaa and go pick the album up at the store. trust me spending the 15 bucks is WELL worth it."
5,No question,This defined Memphis Rap in the mid 90's and for Three 6 Mafia helped launch them on a national campaign that has yet to slow down. This is a must have for any collection ranging from the occasional listener to hardcore fan.This is one CD I can not imagine my life without.
5,Da first album is Da BEST!,"this album is dope, if you like three six mafia you will like dis stuff. lord infamous aka screcrow is the best rapper of all time from three six mafia. so i recomend geting this album, it is da shiznit. Holla at yo boyBEZZIEgo to www.freewebs.com/h2omurderazit is my rap groups web site, michigan 4 LIFE!"
5,Great book,"This is my favorite Photoshop book. I had the previous version and I updated when I got Photoshop CS2. Very clearly writen, a beginner or experienced user of Photoshop can benefit from this book. I really recommend it."
4,heatgear longsleeve compression,It's a good shirt. Did exactly what i needed it to do on a cold night. I am satisfied with the results.
2,Sizes not accurate,"I purchased a men's size medium. When I received it, the item was too small. It looked more sized for a tiny woman or child. I could not wear this product."
2,Works well but bad quality,"I practice Muay Thai about 4 times a week and purchased one of these for its wicking effect. The shirt works as advertised -- it pulls away moisture and can help to keep you comfortable and dry during practice. However, the overall quality of the shirt and its material is poor -- after just wearing it one time, i noticed that the material catches rather easily on other things, like velcro, fingernails, or just as part of normal wear and tear. After just a few weeks the shirt is pretty beat up. I plan on purchasing something similar by a different manufacturer - like Everlast, Title MMA or Pirahna Gear."
1,You call that a peep???!,My sister sent these to me for my birthday because I love peeps. Unfortunately the peeps I received were all shriveled up - very un-peep-like :(. Definitely not what she paid for to say the least. For that kind of $ they should be perfect!Have tried contacting company and have received no response so far. Just left a message again today - we'll see what happens... You're better off to wait until easter and stock up
1,NBA Live 2001...!,"Just as the title states. A perfect NBA game needs certain things. Everything must be on a professional court, unlike NBA Street. Throw in about 7 game modes. (Try single game, season, franchise, 1-on-1, 3-point shootout, practice, and create-a-player.) If you guys ever get a chance to watch TV, turn to basketball. Watch the enemy AI. What the crowd is looking for is awesome gameplay and realistic graphics. Some people even like animations. (arguing with the referee, post-game celebrations, ect.) Put in a variety of options, so the user can perfect the game him/herself. How about some secret players and street courts. I've played other EA Sports games, and I know what their capable of!"
2,Where is the tatoos and old championship teams,"I have been playing this boring game for so long and I haven't seen one tatoo or one old championship team yet! I hope the next year version will be way better than this one, because this is just plain ridiculous. I rather play Live2001 for regular playstation than to play this one."
5,NBA,"who cares where the coaches are? And yes they do argue to refs..... NBA live is probably the best basketball game there is! GRAPHICS are amazing, and gameplay is realistic. NBA STEETZ and the 3 on 3 mode, who cares? this one has every all star player since the 50's. Oh and another thing when SHAQ is shooting freethrows, he MOSTLY misses just like NBA live on TV. oh and another thing. NBA STREET doesn't support MULTITAP. ONLY HAS 2PLAYERS. THIS one can have 8players"
2,Very Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this title. The AI in this game is terrible. When you are winning and keep trying to get a reboud at the end of the game, you can never get it and they keep running behind the three point line and shooting 3s. This game did not maximize PS2s intelligence, graphics or gameplay. Sound is decent but I hope EA comes up with something to match if not top NBA Street"
1,A Huge Disappointment,"EA Sports really had a chance to knock our socks off with NBA Live 2001, but they gave us a real stinker. First off, the control is pretty bad, as you never feel that you have control of the players. The graphics are really pathetic, as the courts look really aliased and *cough* PSone like. The player models move with such rough animation that its hard to watch. The camera angles are also bad. Pass on this game ... hopefully EA can get it right next year."
3,why remove options?,"The game play itself is good, but why remove options that were even around in NBA 95??No custom teams. This was by far the best option of NBA live games, you could name your team, choose your players, even name where you played, now they mysteriously omitted it? What's the point of that? Also why remove franchise mode and the draft to start as season? Needless to say I was very .... Also the create a player mode? Why can you only make people who look like they have down syndrome? Game play is good, but you will feel cheated when you buy it."
4,This game is cool!!!!!!!,I think this game is awesome! It has good gragraphics and the players have tatoos and they have instant replays and pretty cool music. They have All Star teams all the way back to the 50`s. They have all the newest players and even show the players coming out of the locker rooms. IF you dont buy this game you are missing out on alot of fun.
3,PSX 2001 with better graphics and less options. Average,"This is the biggest release to sport less options than it's PSX counterpart. No franchise, No create-your-own teams, ""bad"" response from buttons, and no difference in play from PSX. It does have better graphics, better create-player options (even if it is missing the glasses and headbands i used to love), and smooth frame-rates. Definately wait for 2002, unless you really need a basketball game. I am always disappointed when I have to say Sega has a better sports game than EA Sports."
3,Could be better,"Don't get me wrong, this game is pretty good. However, there are some flaws. The dunking in particular. Who dunks the ball without ever touching the rim? It's like they just thrown it in, and that's it. If I have an open lane to dunk, I want some rim hanging action. Give me a technical foul if you want, but I'm hanging on the rim. Also, the jumpshot is a bit wrong. These guys are 6'5"" or so, and they take a jump shot like Rosie O'Donnel. They barely get their feet off the floor when shooting. Nice game for graphics, but the action could be a little more realistic."
1,Real Talk,"no one listen to this cos87 character.bone are some biten fake rappers that need to get outta here.oh my bad...stay outta here.3 6 has been around since the late 80s and there style is all original. bone was still playin run dmc records when the triple six mafia came out and a lot of the songs they made that this mainstream cos87 dude never even heard of that you can tell bone bit off of. i bet this dude never even heard of lil glock who was with 3 6 in their mixtape days. stupid layzie bone sounds jus like him.but anyway...this album aint even that great anyway,i was jus angered by this dudes comment."
3,Clay Poker Chips,I was a little disappointed - the case for this produce arrived cracked. I would like to have it replaced.
5,an insightful view of destructive relationships,"The author provides a foundational understanding of the psychodynamics and cyclic nature of abusive relationships. Celani explains how adult relations are unconscious repetitions of early childhood 'object relations'. He also compares his theories to those of other researchers and addresses practical methods for helping the victims. He is apparently passionate about the subject, making the book lively and approachable for lay persons as well as for psychotherapists."
3,Eyes of the Heart,"I bought this book for an Anthropology class. It was well worth the read, and I will tell you that I am not big on reading. I could not put it down. My instructor was a friend of the author, and she came to class, and told us her story. You get a good sense of people of Haiti, and how one person can make difference. Needless to say this book made an impression on me."
4,Willie Clayton R&B CD review,"The CD is very good. Clayton's style could be classified as R&B, however it could fall into the Blues catagory by some blues fans. I am a hard core blues fan but others in my circle are not. His style of music is entertaining to both R&B and Hard Core Blues fans."
5,Vespertine,Another great album by Bjork and one of my favorite of hers. All the songs were inspired by Winter which is easy to tell from the light airy sounds on the albums. The album is beautiful through the album art and the songs heard on it. I have no complaints to say about this album.
2,voices and backgroud music don't mix,"What strikes me most about Vespertine is something that has also been prevalent on her previous albums: her voice and the background music simply are not well-balanced. Her voice is just too loud in the mix. It's a serious production error that makes listening to her music quite hard for me. I have no clue why her music is produced this way. Maybe she thinks that her frail voice sounds better when placed up front all the time, but actually it doesn't. Especially on this ablum it would have been so much better if the mix would have been more balanced, since she often hardly sings any real melody. The songs sound pretty boring this way."
4,Bjork - Either you do or you don't,"Vespertine/BjorkEveryone talks about Bjork. She is a cult figure and to thise person who love Bjork then this is a great cd. I like Bjork too but have to say that I was horrified by her performance on the Grammy Awards still this cd is different.Hidden Place is my fav on the cd. It has a positive message and good feeling.Undo - Is interesting too.In general the cd is filled with good tracks. This has been a good summer for musical sincerity - Bjork, India Aire, Rodney Jones - Soul Manifesto, Jill Scott, Craig David. All of these artist are putting the ""real"" into reality. Ad Bjork to the list of must haves."
4,Not your everyday ATB...,"Being a fan of the two ATB albums (Two Worlds and Mixed Melodies), I was surprised to hear that a real ATB session was lot deeper and more progresive than the light upbeat grooves I hvae known them for. While it was not exactly what I was looking for, I was split about 60/40 on the songs from Disc 1 (ATB). My chief complaint was that several segements were held out too long before transitioning into a new beat.Disc 2, with George Acosta, is fabulous. I hadn't heard of him prior to TNA Vol 2, but considering that the original Trance Nation America DJ's I hadn't heard of either, I figured it was bound to be good. And good it is. Acosta's beats are right in line with the kind of fast moving trance I like to hear. Transitions are on the ball, musicial selections are right on, and the feel is great."
4,"ATB shines, Acosta falls short","CD 1: 5 starsCD 2: 3 starsATB did a flawless job of selecting and putting these tracks together. The shear energy and thumping beats of ATB's set is enough to keep you up till the wee hours of the morning. The tracks build great momentum from one song to the next and it is a solid mix. I have to say though, towards the end, I sensed a loss of steam compared to the ramped up beginning.George Acosta's CD felt like sand paper to me. It was way too rough and out of control. The beats are too intense and after a while it gets annoying. Not one of his best mixes.Still ATB's mix is worth the reason to get this set. If you like George Acosta's mix, that's cool too :-)"
4,Miller captures the essence of Belize,"Belize has been a part of my life since 1981, since Chaa Creek was a hut, since Rosita Arvigo was chopping bush with Panti, since Pine Ridge was a live firing range. I am so glad that Carlos Miller wrote this book. I relived so many times and places while reading it. He is very accurate about it's history, which is quite an accomplishment given the chameleon nature of the place. The Belizian people are larger than life. Everyday is a surprise. Everyday is lived fully. I invite you to live in this book for awhile, you will love his characters. Please write a sequel!"
4,The Films are Fantastic!!!,"The Films (recently Tinkers Punishment) are one of the best bands I have heard in a while. These guys are extremely talented and I have been a huge fan since the first time I heard them. Although their CD's are awesome, especially Zero Summer, their live performances are absolutely bad ass! These guys don't miss a beat, they are sharp with their instruments and I can really see them making it huge."
2,"Brings out the potential of DVD, not of games","I went out and rented this after reading reviews saying that it has great visuals, and i agree. It makes full use of its DVD-format. The cutscenes are great, the gameplay, however, isn't. If you've done one level you've done them all. Each one is the same thing, get your army, beat up this guy, and your done. You get very few choices concerning what kind of troops, and it got very repetitive after the first level. I think it could really have been a great game if they hadn't spent so much time on the graphics. Overall, not a very good game, I found the cutscenes to be better than the game itself. I really reccomend not buying this game, I'd wait until they come out with more DVD format games."
1,Unplayable,"When I started playing this game the first thing that hit me was the terrific battle scenes that were displayed in the well done opening credits and the very similar feel that the game had to romance of the three kingdoms. Unfortunately after game play began all my hopes for the game deteriorated into a free-for-all of unrealistic combat between armies that I had little to no control over. I had hopped to be able to have some amount of control over the game but instead I found myself watching volley after volley of animated musket fire and screaming at the computer to let me do something. Somehow I managed to beat my way through most of the game despite having no concept of the controls.This game is not worth any amount of money, if you wish to play it find a friend and play his copy, renting is simply too much money."
5,One of the BEST GAMES EVER,"Incredible game! Awesome graphics and great strategy. It does give people the wrong impression in the beginning, with the fairly-boring but nessicary tutorial. But once you get to the battles, be prepared to be blown away!"
5,Excellent documentary,"This is an excellent documentary in which Gabriel García Márquez discusses the relationship between literature and film. There are excerpts from a number of films for which he wrote the scripts as well as shots of the area in Colombia that provides the settings for many of his novels and short stories. Probably because of a rather graphic scene from the film ""Eréndira"", the documentary has an ""R"" rating."
5,Devotions For Dating Couples,"My wife-to-be and I could not wait to consume the incredible insight from this devotional book. We especially loved the blend of deep spiritual thought with the ""bottom shelf"" practical application. This book is a must read for all dating couples, who are serious about finding THE ONE. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!"
2,Stick to the facts!,"This book is very interesting and contains a lot of helpful hints to combat acne. However, it also contains suggestions for women and teenagers as young as fifteen to go on sythentic hormones for hormonally triggered acne. Synthetic hormones play havoc on a woman's body, let alone on a young teenagers. They even go as far as saying that teenagers(as young as fifteen)can ""welcome the opportunity to prevent pregnancy while helping treat their acne."" I think that Drs. Rodan and Fields need to stick to acne care and keep their opinions of teenage birth control out of it."
1,Curse Death & Spirit is dead dull,"I felt very depressed after watching this having departed $15 of my money for these very boring short stories. I do not even recommend renting it.""The Cursed Doll"" is about this doll that has Satomi's dead sister. Nothing scary, not even mildly, and a poor story line. The doll ends up biting Satomi's neck like some kind of vampire, and she ends up saying she feels her sister is looking over her lovingly. I yawned three times.Story 2, ""The Spirit of the Dead"" is mildly entertaining, but the ending is soo disappointing. and I thought downright stupid. No yawns, but it really disappointed me.Story 3, ""The Haunted In,"" totally boring. Not even a single fright session. I yawned about 4 times.It's very hard to find good genuine horror...it's definitely not here."
3,"goosebump-worthy, but too creepy for little kiddos","My two 15-year-olds really like the creepy weirdness of this story, but as a first grade teacher and mom of a little guy who's prone to nightmares, I would caution adults to carefully consider their audience (and pre-read the book!) before sharing with very young/easily frightened kids."
1,Gave me nightmares for years,"I suppose if I were to rate this on a scary level it'd be 5 stars, but I agree with others that this should not be a children's book, and that's what level I'm rating this on. This is a terrible book for young children. I was 5 when it was read to me in kindergarten and it gave me such terrible nightmares that I'd have to sleep with my parents half the time. Unless you want that interruption, do not read your kids this book or permit it to be read to them. The librarian at school warned us to leave if we thought we'd be scared, but how was I supposed to know? Terrifying pictures and an eerie, ominous catchphrase make this the stuff of nightmares."
1,Big waste of money,"Don't buy this game unless you have a lot of money to waste. This game offers terrible graphics, terrible gameplay and macro management. How fun is it to see a small roller coaster in action? The macro management is also terrible in this game. If you want a fun game for the kids that even adults will like then I suggest Aqua Aqua. Aqua Aqua has superior graphics and it is a lot funner than this game. Theme Par Roller Coaster has to be the worst game out for the Sony 2. Don't waste your money on this game. I suggest WDL World Destruction League, Aqua Aqua or Madden 2001. All three of these games are worth the money."
3,Rollercoaster Tycoon is more fun...,"...but you can't play it on a PS2.TPRC has several good points, including excellent graphics (have you tried camcorder mode?) and interesting little subgames, that work to differentiate it from other simulations. It is pretty cool to be able to ride your roller coasters and other creations (with analog feedback!) once created, too.There are a few letdowns, however. The gold star system of getting points to advance parks is irritating, simply because you can't play the game the way you want - you have to follow along with how the game thinks things should be done. Rollercouaster Tycoon is much more customizable when it comes to the rides, as well. TPRC is a bit dissapointing with the limited number of features and rides you can research and ultimately build.Overall, I give this game a 3 out of 5 -- fun, but it needs work."
1,bad,"really boring and slow. nothing like the pictures. I played it once for about a half hour, and i was thoroughly pulling my hair out in boredom"
5,Interesting,"One of the first games I got for Playstation 2, I've been having a lot of fun with it. It hits right home for me, a person who really likes to create and build things. I haven't gotten bored of it yet. The graphics are pretty good, and this game offers a lot of variety and a lot of room to expand. Reccommended to all who like to build!"
5,Great lavender scent,"Love this product. When we use it with the Homedics air purifier our whole house smells great - and with 2 dogs, that says something!"
5,Smells great,"I love these things. They smell so good and make the air feel and smell great. Just make sure you follow the directions and only put 2 cap fulls into your machine, if you put too much it can be suffocating. So, just make sure you get it right. Also, the directions say it lasts like 6 hours per 2 cap fulls, but mine lasts much longer than that."
2,Vanilla smells like camphor,"My first try was with the vanilla -- and, as I poured it in, I smelled camphor! Yuck! I cannot bear the odor of camphor or patchoulli. It makes me gag. So, I hoped I was wrong and that the smell would go away. It didn't. The camphor odor was strong and the vanilla fragrance was there somewhere. I was having a sensitivity/allergy reaction, so I had to dump the water out and start all over again.In the meantime, I am using a non Homedics scent and hoping that won't hurt the unit. Tomorrow, I'll try the orange or the lime. And if THEY have that camphor smell, I'm SOL.So, if camphor is a clean and uplifting smell for you, go for it. If not, stay away from vanilla.Update:I kept it in my classroom. Then, when I went to fill it, the plastic was all cracked through, and the water leaked all over. This is not my idea of a good product. This product (Homedics Brethe) was a waste of money."
3,some funny stuff but not her best,"got this for my mom who LOVED it but when i watched it, i found her laughing at herself more than i was. it has some funny stuff but not as much as i had hoped."
4,Laughing with The Girls,Truly had a wonderful time with my women friends. We got together toshare quality time as friends on my birthday and enjoyed watching thisDVD.............it was great! Everyone loved it and we had a wonderfulsocial get together.
1,Living Landscapes; all of them,"I think I may have enjoyed all of the living landscapes DVD's. They were in HD DVD mode and I could not find a player that would play them. I was told they no longer make them (players or this format), blue-ray beat them out I guess. They did not play on blue-ray, my regular DVD player or my computer. If they ever become available in these formats (not HD DVD) I would want to see them."
3,my review,"Unfortunately it's not what I ordered. I ordered as you can see from above,the Regular Strength Spray. Instead, you shipped me the Extra Strength. It's fine,and I'm using it, but it's not what I ordered."
1,"Ordered Clear with White Lid, got Blue with Blue Lid","I placed an order for the clear pitcher with a white lid. The reason I ordered the see-through picture so the level of product can be gauged without opening the lid. I was sent a solid blue pitcher which is opaque. This is not the product I ordered. It is very upsetting when a company cannot fulfill an order properly, especially an order as simple as this. I will not order through this seller again. Perhaps you may have better luck."
2,Did not recieve what you advertised and what I ordered.,Just as you are showing here a pitcher with a white top is just what you advertised. You sent me a pitcher with a red top. i didi not want a pitcher with a red top. I wanted a pitcher with a white top.

5,This was a very good book.,"I was only 13 when I read this book, but I loved it after I got done with it. Read it. It is sometimes boring, but in all, it is a very good book."
1,My husbands choice,"My husband ordered this watch for me and I love it. He wanted a waterproof watch so we could swim together.I looked at lots of watches and most of them were bulky and not feminine. We also bought it for a good price .The brand Seiko was another reason we picked this watch. We were also pleased that it was shipped so quicklyI received it and it was very nice , but when my wife puts on a long sleeve coat or anything long sleeve it opens the catch on the band !!! Very unhappy with it. I am going to a jeweler to see if he can fix it. The band catch has 2 sides that have to be squeezed and it opens. But if one side is hit it opens the band.Gerard"
2,"Cute boot, fits funny","The first time I've ever bought boots online w/o trying them on...big mistake :) They look nice, but just didn't fit my feet. Better luck next time."
2,Sub-standard for Proctor & Gamble,"What I received was not what was pictured. The 12 inhalers were not packaged as shown, but were loose in a cardboard box. The box was closed, but not sealed. The individual inhalers were also not sealed in any way. Can't recall the last time I purchased anything that was taken internally -- that didn't have a tamper-proof seal! The design of the product was different as well. They had a very cheesey key-chain attached to the top. The little chains are very poor quality, as are the ""O"" rings securing them to the product cap. The rings appeared to have been squished closed with pliers, leaving them in the shape of a ""Jesus fish,"" with two sharp ends protruding.Not the quality that I'm used to from Proctor & Gamble, and isn't what was advertised. According to the box, this product was made in India. I'll buy my pharmaceuticals from the local drug store in the future."
3,O.K. book but the sequel is better!,"I love to sit down to a good christian novel and learn more about how God can work in people's lives. I especially appriciate learning new things about our Creator through a well thought out story. This story is well thought out and it's twists and turns were enough to keep me reading. Yet, I found the writing to be a bit too melodramatic in some instances. I also found that the faith of the characters were underdeveloped. You experienced them turing to God but little of where there faith began and scriptural back up to their claims. I almost stopped reading the book, yet it did have just enough of a plot to keep me interested. I also continued to read in anticipation of better writing from the author of the sequel. I was not disappointed in the sequel! Overall, the two books are worth your time."
4,Stylish and comfortable,"Comfortable shoe, but the straps are a little short. I had to make an extension. Looks great with jeans."
2,On the Morn of Mayfest Paperback book,"I appreciate being able to get the book, but once received I was disappointed that I was overcharged for it. It was a paperback reprinted from a hardcover - and still had the hardcover price printed on the cover alongside the barcode. The book should have been no more that $7 in my opinion. Delivery was prompt and service was fine."
5,ok,this is sweet little cup holder put it in my loncoln towncar for better cup holder must get this. it
5,Loved It!,"Being a fan of Pat Parelli already, I absolutely loved this book! It is very well written for the most part. It is a little bit educational, but mostly it is entertaining. It almost reads like a novel. I think that any ""horsey"" person would enjoy this book, but I highly recommend it to all Parelli fans. Pat, former gang member, huh?! There's lots of fascinating and entertaining tidbits just like that in the book."
3,"The Truth About Jasper, Texas","I have waited for a book to be written about the real Jasper, Texas for years. This book encompasses every single thing that Jasper is about and then some. Jasper will never change until this type of book comes to the forefront. I thank this author for writing this and interviewing the many many black people who face this kind of predjudice everyday of their lives.Having been raised in Jasper and the daughter of a criminal lawyer from that city, I know too well what these people face and I have fought this predjudice on their behalf all of my life.Let me add one thing, James Byrd, Jr. was absolutely loved by his family, There are things in this book that are untrue about his relationship with his family."
4,Good Author,"Typical of good writers such as Michael Crichton and Tony Hillerman, Mr. Frayne uses common events and situations to weave a story with both entertaining and educational qualities. The story line is really good and many of us are also very interested in Arab culture due to current world events. This book gives me some additional insight from a man who has experienced twelve years in Saudi Arabia."
1,Not a convincing book,"Very simplistic, faith promoting account of a not-so-skeptical skeptic's journey into Mormonism. This is a book that will make Mormons feel good, but offers very little in the way of answers to the tough questions that plague the Mormon Church."
3,Fell short,"While i did like this book, it left me with a feeling that something was missing from the storyline. It was not as good as her previous books."
3,Not the best,This dvd wasent what i thought it would be it's just him talking about the diffrent photes hes taken over the years.I thought it would be him on location showing us how he got these pics
4,Perfect for Beginners,Hate to say but D&D is about as much fun as AD&D. In other words for those that don't know what I'm talking about: D&D=Dungeons & Dragons (very basic) AD&D=Advanced Dugeons & Dragons (very complecated)
3,Good book but definitely not for everyone...,"Lots of color photos which is great. GREAT! how-to color photo sequence for making the head, body, etc. Very cute ideas for clothes. But I dislike those tiny color photographs of near non-existent patterns which are also without adequate instructions. This author's aim when it comes to clothing patterns is that you learn to make your own patterns. Like most of the other reviewers, I don't like the photocopying, then re-photocopying at different percentages that the author suggests. I also am glad for the so-called ""pattern"" (color copies of limbs and torso) of a jointed ""baby"" body. ""Making Waldorf Dolls"" (a much better book) has a jointed ""doll"" body but I wanted a ""baby"" body too. Even though the title does not mention Waldorf Dolls or Sock Dolls, that is what this book is about. I happen to love sock dolls for their soft huggability."
4,Sweet and simple,"I wanted an introduction to the art of baby doll making.I got it when I bought a second hand copy of this book.I enjoy it,it is gentle,user freindly,and uncomplicated."
3,Not for beginner,"This book has some good pictures and I like the look of the authors work but it is not for a beginner. The patterns are literally 2"" tall and say enlarge as needed. Some of the stuff has no patterns - like the baby doll body with bent limbs. Some good ideas for an advanced seamstress but there are better books out there that cover this subject."
5,The best strategy turn-based of the year.,"If you need action,war,and thought this is the game for you if you have start to play the alpha centauri just only for 1 hour and you are still in front of your computer monitor then you are one of the many people that they don't suffer from the alpha centauri maniac or syndrom call it what ever you like.But do this buy it!"
2,You have no control,"The game has great potential, but so many things are automated that you CANNOT do what you want. It is very difficult seize control from the automation. Unfortunately, the automation is stupid and prevents you from carrying out interesting or reasonable strategies. The game needs to provide much more support for user strategies. I got so frustrated that I injured my elbow by banging it on my desk."
2,"""Okay"" sci-fi sim from Sid meier","Alpha Centauri fails at providing this game player with any kind of new excitement from Sid Meier. One can appreciate breaking away from the Civ 1/2 games, however the paradigm factions the game is based upon are just plain atypical and boring. In effect, military versus humanists, microsoft versus professors, etc... kinda like the UN playing ""Lost in Space."" Previous Sid Meier games were more tangible, the sci-fi in this was kinda corny. I've spent many a sleepless night playing the previous Meier games, but this one just seemed ""okay,"" not spectacular."
4,Missing a Key Ingredient,"Alpha Centauri, though not technically a sequel, extends and broadens the Civ series. The graphics are good and--this being a Sid Meier game--the gameplay is almost perfect. Centauri is a tremendously addictive game, with action, adventure, and a sci-fi backstory that will keep you in your chair until you lose the feeling in your legs.But it's missing an important element, one that made the Civilization series so successfull: The ability to change real-world history, to wonder 'what if?' The Alpha Centauri world is fake, fictional in the truest sense, and all the cool technologies and compelling writing in the world can't stop a player from noticing.Still, the game is well worth your money."
3,not that tight,"i expected this $hit to be tight as hell""breakin da law"" is alot bettathey got 1 song from breakin da law on here and thats tire shopget breakin da law its real rare and i got it if u wanna trade music hit ah ni99ah up at hearless_murderah_187@yahoo.com"
4,Hits a Bone Run!,"This book- the fifth in the John Becker series-once again does not disappoint. A very suspenseful thriller combined with incredible tension between the characters produces a thriller of nail-biting dimensions. By illustrating the strengths and weaknesses of the players involved in this drama, David Wiltse manages to breathe life and depth into what would be an engaging thriller by any standards.With a serial killer loose in his hometown, both Becker and his best friend Police Chief Thomas Terhune become caught up in their own personal anxities and almost let the killer slip away... I won't reveal any more of the plot line but if you enjoy David Wiltse's work this one will not disappoint you, and if you are a fan of Patricia Cornwell or James Patterson and are looking for something better-LOOK NO FURTHER!"
1,Stopped working within a month,"Not only is this device way more complicated and feature-laden than the average user will want or need, but mine stopped working immediately. I wanted a nice digital alternative to the old-style mechanical timers you can use to turn your lights on when you're out of town, and supposedly this was it, but the instructions were so bewildering that it took me an hour just to program it. Then, it stopped working. Avoid at all costs unless you like obtuse instructions and shoddy workmanship."
1,Complete garbage,"this book is completely abstract and full of jargon, pompuous and empty. Waste of money!"
2,YIKES!,"I don't get how ANYONE can wear this stuff! Thought I'd give it a try a couple months ago & haven't used it since. Sure it smells nice. Nice & STRONG. But you seriously need to cover your face while spraying it. Cause you will damn near choke to death. Plus, it didn't seem all that effective. NO thank you."
5,Great stuff,"Protect what's most important to you! It's great stuff that really works. I just finished up the MS 170 doing a century day one and following that up with an 85 miler the next day. This stuff got me through without nearly as much chaffing as a 20 mile ride without the stuff. Great product and worth the money. Trust me on this, it's going to save your a$$."
4,Works as expected,"Works as I expected. Product as described. Not as many color choices as there are with other switches, but ivory was what I was looking for anyway."
2,Ok type product,"Product is faily good. It talks about extended life. But I do not find it that way. Even if it has extende life, it is tough to notice as I am sure that life is not considerably more.It is bulky and make your PDA even thicker, makes PDA look ugly.Price wise I think it is OK."
4,quality that impresses,can't say enough about this portable little beauty. but i'll start with one confession: sadly the complaints about noise do bode true. but if this is not your only camera then let go of that worry. i've been using this camera in multiple settings for a couple weeks now. the 16x9 aspect ratio is really interesting and the wide angle lens is perfect for this size of a camera. the manual settings and programmed settings are distinctive and work very well. i also just love the extra time leica took to animate the colorful menu. a wise purchase if your looking to treat yourself.
2,not what i expected,"I'm a professional photographer used to work with a Canon Mark II and, when using film, a M4P. The D-Lux3 was a complete dissapointment. The noise is just huge in high ISO, the sharpen is too harsh and the camera lacks a normal viewfinder forcing you to look at the image through a screen. Not a camera worth of carrying the Leica logo on it."
3,so-so,"I like the camera's look and feel, but am disapointed with the picture quality reletive to the price of the camera. It may be that I still haven't figured out all of the manual options that set this camera apart, but the preset options (especially indoor pics) haven't wowed me yet."
2,okay but just up and buy the d-lux 4,"The camera is okay. I just sold it and bought a new d-lux 4, a much better camera than the d-lux 3."
5,Mac of Camera,"I purchased this camera D-Lux3 almost 4 years ago in 2008. My wife complained about the slower response time compared to Canon powershots. Yes a little bit slower than any other Point and Shoot cameras, however, because of that if the moment is right this camera takes fantastic pictures. Manual setting is very fun to do tricks. Probably Lumix version is smiler but that doesn't lower this camera's ratings. Quality of pictures taken by this camera is very consistent and good."
5,Simply Fabulous,"This album is simply fabulous! From start to finish, each song tells a story. Her voice is warm and very emotive. Recommended to anyone who enjoys music with substance."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing. Not awful or anything, and certainly worth the bargain price I paid for it from a close out dealer here, but it was no better than ok. Small ok, you notice no caps. It covers a lot, which is ok, or even good, and understandable when it can't go into too much detail any one place. It's worth watching for a modest price, I'll probably watch it again sometime, but it will probably be a while, but it's not memorable at all. Visually it's not all that good either, it looks to me like a poor transfer from VHS, the video quality is not very good."
3,Album aimed @ Kids !,"This is an Australian album project which was specially recorded for children. Full of fun, pretty little songs all with an environmental theme. ""16 Beaut songs about animals and our precious earth"" - Cilla Black"
4,Good for a kid,"Great gun for my 11 year old son. Very low power but gives him the ""machine gun"" experience in a safe way. He doesn't know he is missing anything. Seems to be pretty well built. Has the ""laser pointer"" and a flashlight so he has a ball with it. 5 STARS for a kid, 1 STAR for an adult. I just want you to know what you are looking at."
2,bad range but good beginner gun,i bought this airsoft gun about a year ago it still works as good as the day i bought it but if you are wanting a even half way decent gun stay away from this airsoft gun it has terrible range and is very low powered. Although it does make the perfect gun for first timers if you fire from the waist pointing the barrel up but i would not recommend buying this gun. its fps says 300 but i would say it is more like 220.
1,Pretty Pictures don't save the boring patterns,"Yes, there are some lovely pictures in this book but I was less than impressed with the projects and patterns found inside. It probably wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't so expensive - if you can find a used copy for cheap buy it. But what really botered me was how unoriginal the projects were. The garter stitch pillow case was the worse, the stockingnette stitch plants and the rag rug were all close runners up. Everything in this book I have seen free patterns for on the net and with only 18 projects I would recommend something else - anything else. This book did not impress me at all, no matter how pretty the pictures were."
4,Great fountain pen for under $30,I like this one a lot. The fact that it is made of clear plastic makes it a conversation starter. But what really counts is the fact that it writes well and does not leak.
4,Good Pen,"The Lamy Vista demonstrator fountain pen has a great body and good looks. It's just as transparent now as when I purchased it. It came with Lamy blue, but I've also tried their black and turquoise. Lamy turquoise ink happens to be my favorite so far. I would have preferred an EF nib; the F nib writes a little too wide for my taste and caused the ink to smudge some during normal use. (I prefer very thin lines; I like the Hi-Tec-C 0.4mm.)All in all, this fountain pen is definitely worth purchasing, but if you like thin lines, get the EF nib if you can."
2,Disappointing in most ways!,"It is an inexpensive, cheaply made fountain pen and it works. There appears to be a crack in the body where it joins the nib assembly. When the nib assembly is dipped for refilling from the ink bottle, the entire internal assembly flooded with ink and the refillable converter not a drop! I needed to fiddle with the entire assembly to get the converter to work properly. The Lamy converter is very plasticky! The Fine nib is not! The pen writes wetly with premium Namiki Iroshizuku inks and more like a ""Medium"" nib. Overall, I cannot recommend this for anyone wanting a good fountain pen. If I lost this one on safari, there would be no regrets."
4,Favorite artists - bland audio,"I love these two. This was a great concert from yesteryear. Bad news, the audio has to be cranked up & never meets the standard of a concert."
5,Nostalgia,I bought this for my Mum who is 94. She absolutely loved it and I did too. It's just what we wanted to see - the old Xmas shows with Andy and his brothers and the Osmonds when they were very young - so cute! Brought back many wonderful memories of christmas. Defintely worth buying if you grew up with these shows.
3,Good But Not Great,"I've been a fan of Limp Bizkit since 1996 when they were playing in small clubs and I think they're awesome. Their first album was Excellent, The second 4 stars, Chocolate Starfish 3 stars because of the fact that it dosen't even really sound like LB anymore. I guess I just don't like the way they went from Hardcore Rock-Rap to mostly Rap with less rock. This is a good album though, just if you really want the Limp Bizkit expirence go out and get their first album 3 Dollar Bill yall$!"
1,"If I could give it no stars, I would","I didn't like any of the Wen products including this Texture balm. it did nothing for my hair except make it greasy...and no, I didn't use too much of it. I only used a little on my palms.It just sucked."
3,"Meh, an ok pomade; there's better out there.","It's hard finding a good pomade for African American hair, and while this balm will mostly keep your hair in one place, it gums up and is hard to remove later. Because it gums up, throughout the day, it would look like I had little white balls in my hair. I hate that! Then, I would have to use even more of the Wen Conditioning Cleanser to get it out. Frustrating!I used it after I used the cleansing conditioner and oil, but I would rather use my grandma's tried and true pomade than the balm."
3,It's okay,"It was highly recommended by my hair dresser friend. She said it does wonders for Asian hair. I had high hopes, but it is okay. it doesn't give my hair enough texture. I like Short Sexy Hair hair wax and that's what I'm sticking with."
2,Not worth the price,"This book is very thin on content and provides only a shallow overview of NT service programming. It tries to cover far too much territory in too few pages.The author's C++ ""framework"" class for NT services makes some extremely naive assumptions, particulary with regard to processing SCM control messages. (See John Bell's article in the August 1998 C/C++ User's Journal for a much better C++ service framework.)This book is not a good place to learn about service programming from scratch; and if you already know the basics, this book has nothing new to tell you."
2,Fast and quick response,Only liked one song on here that he had played on All my Children. Didn't like the rest but that isn't the sellers fault. They shipped right away and was a good price and would buy from them again.
2,What is this?,"I thought that this album was rediculous, I didn't think that it was even serious when I began listening to it. It has somewhat of an island feel to it, which was completely unexpected. I think that it is poorly put together and not at all what I thought it would be."
5,Lovely Book,This book is lovely. The images are wonderful and the text is concise and meaningful. It is a real pleasure to look at the book. I look forward to buying new titles as they become available.
3,The Price References on the Pianos Are Questionable.,"Most information in the book is good information. However, the price references on the pianos in the book are questionable. The prices given in the book on many pianos are much much higher than reasonable prices. You could find much much better prices when you shop carefully from dealers. I think the dealers will like the book because they can make much much more money if people go with the reference prices in the book."
1,Great Religious Music Collection,3 VHS tapes containing music videos with 60 great religious songs.Songs for the whole family. Best religious music collection I have ever seen or heard.
3,CAN-I-BUS PLEASE GET RID OF WYCLEF!!!!!!!!!!,This is to CAN-I-BUS himself.Hey man i am a big fan of your lyrical skills.I think as a lyricist you are in the top five.But i wanted to let you know that WYCLEF .... you big time with those beats and if i was you i'd kick his BUTT.I highly anticipated your album i was not dissipointed lyrically but beat wise i was expecting alot more. On everything i've heard you on you were blaze.especially that underground freestyle .... with dmx and noreaga.You'll blow up when you get some dangerous beats.Just a word of advice talk to DJ CLUE or TRACKMASTERS.Dj Clue hooked you up on that fantastic four joint.With phat beats the sun won't have jack on how hot you'll be.
4,Da Canibus LP is tight,"It's ill, ya know. It could've been so much better by releasing more than 14 tracks(that's pretty low to me) and 3 of em suck(like Hype-nitis) Sinnaz On A Rampage 4- life son"
2,i didnt get to listen to it at this site,this internet site really is not very helpful when it comes to buying music. If you cant listen to the music how are you going to know if you want to buy it or not.
2,This album is a big dissipointment,Canibus is a big bust thought to be the one of the best albums of all times and it was won of the worst. Wyclef came out bad with the production and canibus reused lots of lyrics better luck next time.
3,"Much anticipated, but it falls short of expectations","From the artist who's traded verses (and shots) with the Lost Boyz and L.L. among others, we get the first full album flavor from proven battler, Canibus. As a fan of his through his guest spots, i expected so much more in terms of originality and total album composition. Its not a horrible CD and i'll still be around listening for more, but at first glance its not the greatest either. The eye-catching tracks are Get Retarded, Niggonometry, the laid back Whats Going On?,Also features the previously released, 2nd Round K.O. and How We Roll.The title says Can-I-Bus?... you can, but please, please, bus harder next time.By the way... make it 3 1/2."
4,Fine music!,"Eilis Kennedy is a fine Irish performer with a clear, gentle voice. You'll want to listen to the whole album again and again; it doesn't get old. The pieces in Gaelic are particularly appealing."
5,"These work great, without the disgusting cherry flavor.","I love these because this cough suppressant is the only ingredient I need - no decongestants, etc. - when I have the cough that typically lingers after a cold. If I pop two of these before bed, I can sleep through the night, and I don't have to gag on the cherry flavored liquid."
5,Beautiful knife - georgeous,"Much copied, never equaled, this is the seminal knife that spawned a thousand copies. Excellent balance, strong, light, easy to use, feels like the quintessential hand held knife. Good for field dressing, delivering final grace to a wounded animal, or as a belt held utility knife - this knife excels.This is an original, and is still the best. If you carefully examine the clones, you will see gaps in the frame and bolster.Beware the edge when purchased - it will shave your arm hairs down to the quick in one speedy pass."
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"This video just didn't do it for me. The music was great and it started ok, but towards the end it just ran out of air. it's too bad because the dancing and choreography was great."
1,! unlistenable,I remember buying a record by DNA when it first came out...and I was really surprised later when arto lindsay and the ambitious lovers were able to turn this mess into great music. This is very unprofessional
1,Doesn't come close to Milepost,"After using the Milepost extensively in Alaska, I looked for something similar for Montana. However, Explore! is not close to Milepost's detailed information. If the Milepost were available for every state, that's what I'd pick. Next time I go out west, I'll find something besides Explore!"
3,More power supply problems,"Unlike the other respondents, I found the initial tech support prompt and thorough. I also have a power supply failure just out of warranty (nov 2003 purchase). Dell don't want to know about the possibility of a defective batch and blamed recent storm activity in my area. I'm still waiting on their quote but will be looking to alternative suppliers. A pity, really. I've been a loyal Dell customer and have happily recommended DELL to my friends for years...that may change now (depending on the quote , which didn't arrive in the promised timeframe, and the promptness of their service)."
1,Everything works nice if it will stay on...,"I have three of these phones, one with the answering system. Everything about them is perfect until the battery dies. A product is only as good as its weakest link. If the battery would last for longer than 10 minutes I might not complain about it but well... maybe you will have better luck."
2,Low tech 6.0 ??,"No issues with battery life. Have left phone out of cradles for several days. Bluetooth works well too. My reason for a low rating? We live at the end of a long power line run. Power flickers two or three times a week...with batteries in each handset I am at a loss to explain the the date and time needs to be re-set, sometimes even when other clocks, like the oven, which does not have a battery, does not....if your rarely out of electricity- no problem...or buy a VTech and then find out how often your power level dips!"
4,"Rare, and for hard-core Pantera fans only !!!","This album sounds like a mix between ""a rough blueprint for Cowboys From Hell"" and any of Rob Halford's albums with Judas Priest. I'm not knockin' the album,I enjoy it,but, I also think it's definitely for hard-core fans, and any one who loves ""80's era"" metal.If you've heard this, you know exactly what I mean. Invest in this album if you can, it's definitely worth giving a few spins. Phil sounds younger, and hits some notes on this that you won't hear on any Pantera record. The music is cliche ""80's metal""Worth owning......? Yes !A true gem, that any metal-head (especially those who worship at the throne of Pantera) will love!!!-Chris"
5,swinging away in the balmy breezes,I use it everyday...it is holding up great and it is comfy and sturdy. A great product and highly recommended.
5,Don't be concerned with boot-up time.,"First let me address the slow starting. This HD DVD player is not like your usual standard definition player. It actually is like a computer, with RAM and a hard drive. My suggestion is turn on your player, get everything else ready to go and, no problems. We are only talking about 30 seconds or so. It is no big deal. Enjoy! I am."
2,Very Discouraged with the HD-A2,"I bought the HD DVD-A2 yesterday. Came home, hooked it up with HDMI to DVI on my Sony rear projection television. I started paying the HD DVD of Miami Vice, which looked great! I wanted to see what a regular DVD would look like, so I put in Office Space and the player said thie disc is not DVD format. Arggh. I tried another DVD, Slinglade, and the same message appeared. I downloaded the lastest firmware upgrade from Toshiba (2.3) burned it to a CD-R and plopped it in the HD DVD drive. Same message - this disc is not DVD format!! Very discouraged and will probably return this player and buy a Blu-Ray."
4,works for me,"Takes a little time warming up, but otherwise perfectly good unit. I haven't explored all the options, but put a dvd in and push the button and it works fine."
2,"decent, but HD DVD will be a wasted investment soon enough",take a look at studio support before you decide to go HD DVD or Blu-ray. Warner Brothers will be going exclusive to Blu-ray soon enough so it would be wise to hold on buying any HD DVD equipment. its a slow death from here on out...
5,SPECTACULAR player!,This is a great player for the price and will give you an excellent hd picture and great sound as well. Highly recommended!
2,we all deserve $50 gift cards on these obsolete loser HD players...Amazon needs to step up like Best Buy already has!,"the title says it all!$50 gift card necessary for customer goodwill...format war was settled well before many of us consumers purchased these players yet these manufacturers and retailers like Amazon, Best Buy,Circuit City and the like took advantage of the consumer.Foster and Martin know nothing!"
1,Lacking storage!!!,I have had the HD-A2 for a few months now and have found a fault. When more HD-DVD's come out with downloadable web content you will not have space to download it. I have Transformers and cannot download all of the stuff to my player and you have to delete it before trying to get something for another DVD. It seems that they should have added the ability to plug in an external drive so that you can download and watch all content for the discs you own instead of having to download and then delete after watching. maybe a future update will help.
1,Does not play full 1080P Resolution = dvd 1.5,Does not play full 1080P Resolution = dvd 1.5. You might want to wait till the 1080P players come down in price before buying an HD player.
1,Customer service sucks!,"I think my following comments to Toshiba customer service say it all...""Oh, so after just 4 months of ownership, your product craps out (the product that the Toshiba touts as the most reliable, fantastic and best HD-DVD player on the market). And, as a result of this $400.00 dollar, ""high end"" device being defective, I, the consumer, have to make a trip to buy a box that fits (with such a reliable device and brand name, why would I need to keep the original box?). Then I have to buy shipping tape, take the time to package it, make another trip to the post office, wait in line for 20 minutes, then pay $18.00 to ship it? The customer has to do all of this?Your piece of s@#t device FAILED!!! Why do I have to do all of the work!!Rest assured that this will be my last Toshiba product and my comments WILL hit every electronics website that has a ""customer review"" section.Great customer service, a##holes!!!!!Have a great day!""C. Henretty"
2,tosiba HD A2,"i bought this dvd player thinking that it would create good sound and picture but it was not upto my expectation. the picture look good on 16:9 ratio but i could not zoom it to see in full screen of my 50 plasma tv. i could only zoom when i change the resolution to 480i or 480p. so whats the point of having HD if you cant see full screen. now iam gonna have to buy a tv that lets zoom 720, and 1080p resolution. otherwise i might have to buy a projector. if hd dvd and hd tv are fully compatible then this dvd is awesome"
3,Slips off when I'm barefoot,"I had purchased this item because I thought it would be great for when I am doing yoga or walking in my house barefoot. I don't like wearing my shoes in the house. However, I find that when I use it this way I can barely get from one room to the next without it slipping off my foot. That aside, it does work well to ease my metatarsal pain when worn under my socks and in shoes."
3,Ok,"They are ok, kind if slippery on your feet. Also, keep in mind they are sort of thick and make your shoes tighter."
5,Jewelry Armoire,"I love this. Much larger than any armoires available in local stores. Felt lined drawers. Lots of cubbies in several of the drawers. Arrived much sooner than anticipated. Packaging was wonderful, layer upon layer of protection."
5,Super Sodoku made it easy to learn,"This book helped me learn basic Sodoku techniques, so I went from beginner to intermediate within 2 weeks. I recommend it for anyone who is looking for strategies. The book's puzzles do get more challenging. Having the easy puzzles at first lets you build confidence, and then you move on to the more difficult."
4,first timer,"I'm a 16 year old girl who has had sweat rings since the end of 8th grade. I mostly sweat perfusivily when I am nervous, which is a majority of the time since I'm extremely shy. But I also sweat just sitting on my couch. The rings can get really big sometimes and it's extremely embarassing. It is my second day trying Certain Dri: yesterday it didn't work, but tonight as I put it on I actually felt itching and burning, unlike yesterday. So I believe I did something wrong the first day. The itching is somewhat intense considering I have sensitive skin, but I feel like it just may work. I'm hoping so because I have no other alternitive."
5,AMAZINGGG,"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!! I have tried the clinical strength deodorants and just about anything to try and stop this excessive sweating. I just kept thinking, I'm a freaking girl, why am I sweating like a man?!?! And it was just embarrassing. I hated it. All year around I would wear a hoodie or a jacket, even in the hottest days of summer... It was terrible. I could never take it off because then you would see how sweaty I was. Then I found CertainDri. Seriously people, this changed my life! There is sweat no more! I can finally wear my favorite shirts without a hoodie or jacket over it! I LOVE IT!!! THANKS ALOT!!! =)"
3,72 hours? Not really...,"I got this in hopes of it stopping my excessive sweating, but the 72 hour thing is a lie. If I don't reapply this every night then I will sweat the next day and usually the following day even if I remember to put it on. Applying it every night ends up irritating my skin and I do not have very sensitive skin. I really wish this worked a little better but it does help a bit and anything is better than nothing."
2,didn't work for me,"certain dri did not work for me, although i am sure it does work for people who do not sweat the amount i used to... instead, i would recommend a topical cream with 1% glycopyrrolate. this is the only product that worked for me and it has really been amazing, since i was beginning to give up hope that anything would ever help me! i had to get a prescription from my skin doctor and it costs me $25 per container, but if it is a severe problem for you, it will completely be worth it! it might take a week or so to work, so do not give up right away... it works really well from then on! i finally can wear colored, tight shirts instead of just black!"
3,Does not work for everyone,"I have to say I'm very jealous of all the happy five-star reviews this product got. I was hopeful that my perspiration problems would be solved after buying this, but it hasn't done a whole lot to stop me from sweating. I followed the directions perfectly the first two days, and I still sweated (though not quite as much, granted). Then for the next two nights I loaded the stuff on (no, it didn't irritate my skin either), and it still didn't work. I must be a hopeless exception to the rule, but keep in mind if you're considering buying this that there's a chance it won't work for you."
2,Not that impressed,"Not sure if I got a bad bottle, but when I went to apply it the liquid went everywhere. It also was leaking in the box. Sitting at my desk now with sweaty pits and I am cold! I will say they aren't as sweaty as usual, but still more sweat than the average person sitting behind a desk should experience. So not sure if I got a ""bad one"" or if it's just not strong enough for me."
5,This stuff works.,"I had tried several different brands and home-remedies (including Germ-X, which worked for a while) for decreasing the amount of sweat I produced. I tried Certain-Dri based on the reviews, and have to say that I am completely satisfied with it. Other than a little dryness of the skin at times, the product works well. I put it on at night before bed, and I'm good to go for the next two days. And because of the small amount required, the product lasts a good while. (I also tried Maxim, which works just as well. For both, there is a little irritation or dryness, but is totally worth the reduction in sweat.)"
2,Didn't work as well for me as many of the reviews suggested,"I had high hopes after reading the other reviews. I have noticed maybe a slight decrease in sweating but not enough to justify continuing to use the produce, especially with the uncomfortable tingling."
5,Works extremely well,"If you're looking for a product that is both inexpensive and works well, this is it. It does exactly what it says it does.It's sort of a longer term solution. If you put it on at night it'll last for up to 72 hours, but for me usually wears off around the second day. Put it on every night, you'll never have a problem with sweating.This isn't scented, so if you're looking for scented stuff- you can use something else to put on in the mornings. This strictly only stops the sweating, and it's good at doing it."
1,Nothing...,"I put it at night, woke up, took a shower and after a few hours was all wet.It didn't work for me. Perhaps, I was applying it incorrectly or something. Tried it for 2 days and just dropped it.Before that I was using Drysol. Drysol is the thing! however, it's more expensive... but I guess you get what you pay for."
4,non-sweaty pits,I would totally recommend this product. I do not get embarassed anymore because I now have dry arm pits!
4,I'll give it 4.5 stars,"This product does work for me. I had a problem with sweaty underarms and I was not able to wear the cute fitting girly shirts. I was basically forced to wear loose shirts. I saw certain-dri advertise on TV and decided to try it. Well, the first couple of weeks, it did not work for me and I thought that I had wasted my money, so I stopped using it. About a month and a half later, I decided to start using it again since it had already been paid for. I noticed a change within 2 days! I was so happy that my problem was solved. I don't sweat excessively at all now, There is still moisture from time to time, but nothing major to worry about. It was so successful that I haven't used certain dri in about 3 or 4 months and I still don't excessively sweat. I do still use it from time to time. This product worked wonders for me and hopefully it will do the same for you also."
4,Best anti-perspirant ever used,"I am fifteen, and I have always had a problem with wetness under my arms. I would be freezing cold in class, and I would still see sweat. I tried every deodorant/anti-perspirant I could find. But, of course nothing worked. I was going to go to the doctor for my problem. Instead I did some research online and saw Certain-Dri.I bought it, and I read the directions. All you have to do is roll it on. I shaved before putting it on though. So, I had a major burning sensation for about thirty minutes. I'll never do that again.Well, anyway, today was the first day I had it on and it worked very well. I was a little wet, but you couldn't see any sweat stains. And, I'm hoping it will eventually go away for good.I gave it four stars because you can't shave or bathe before putting it on. It's a bit annyoing. It's worth it though."
5,This stuff really works!,I no longer have the great lakes residing in my shirts' armpit areas. So fresh and so clean.
3,"Good, but not great.","I sweat... a lot. This product serves me well on days when it is not too terribly hot and I am not too terribly active. Otherwise, it's nothing to write home about. It's better than regular antiperspirant, but still not as great as you might be hoping for."
2,It minimally worked,"I tried this and despite the burning feeling under my armpits, it worked for about a couple of weeks. However, now, about 2 weeks after using it, it is entirely ineffective. I am extremely disappointed that this deodorant no longer works. I followed the directions explicitly, but it isn't effective. Any suggestions on a better type of antiperspirant?"
2,Dissapointage,"Being a faithful follower of the DescendentsALL saga I was excited for this live stuff. Not too mention the songs were picked by the fans. The song choices, for the ALL cd anway is so-so. The sound quality for both is worse. It doesn't mean I will stop loving both bands but I reccomend Liveage, Hallraker and Trailblazer for the true live experience."
1,DONT BUYYY,Just bought this light bulb and it already burnt out after the first day! I am beyond upset about this because it didn't even last a whole day! Worst bulb ever!!!
3,"It's okay, but not for me.","I bought the 100W version of this lamp to try to increase the heat a in my tortoise's box a little bit. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to provide any more warmth. In fact, his basking area was cooler than it was with the 75W bulb I bought earlier. Anyway, it worked fine, but it only provided half the heat while using more electricity."
4,so far so good.,purchased these to replace and back up the reptisun self ballasted mercury vapor bulbs which didn't last very long. I've had it in for a few weeks and it's still running. I have had various UV basking bulbs in teh past burn out quickly. If you don't see an edit they are still going strong.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I should have listened to the product reviews. I was sitting at my bed and heard a loud pop, I ran to my turtles tank and noticed that the bulb had exploded while my turtles were basking under it! DO NOT BUY IT!!!"
1,never buy again,"Thinking I was going to get 12 bottles, I was surprised to recieve only 1 and the shipping for the 2 oz bottle was $5.95. Read all the fine print! Never will I buy from this seller again. Rather deceptive I think. $5.95 shipping should cover 12 bottles. Buy this anywhere cheaper considering you will get only 1 bottle shipped at the 12 bottle rate. I find it hard to believe Knife Shop didn't have more than 2 oz. of honing oil."
4,Awesome book,"Thsi book is an awesome book. Very helpful, though the beginning is a bit to easy. I also noticed that it starts off at page 7. i am holding it now.I open it, and it is the title page. ok, page 1.The next page has all the copyright info. page 2. The next page has the table of contents, page 3, right? No, it actually is page 7 for some reason. Flawed, but invaluable. id recommed uscf 1000-1500"
2,Didn't last,This light is on approximately 12 hours/day. It only lasted 1 month. That's about 360 hours. Exo Terra website says their light should last 3000 hours -- what can I say?
4,Great ESV edition,"There is a certainly a shortage of study Bibles in the ESV....this edition is better than okay but not wonderful, in my opinion. It's also very heavy compared to what I'm used to. However, I still highly recommend this one over the other (few) ESV study Bibles out there."
5,Brother HL-5240 laser desk top printer,"This was purchased to replace an older Brother Laser printer that had served its time well. The HL-5240 responded promptly to Win XP pro with no problem. The unit was very reasonable in price and was faster and quieter than the previous much older Brother laser printer. Good value for a single station office desk printer, or a home office general printer. Print is BW, but you can get very high resolution if necessary for certain print jobs, such as photos for documentation.For general use, the memory contained is ok, but you can purchase a chip to boost the memory, and it takes just 1 min to install in a side port."
3,prints good but not envelopes,"Except for always creased envelops, printer is just fine. I own three of the same make/model printers and Brother has not yet answered my email regarding envelopes."
2,Wish I had My Brother Hl-5140 Back!,"This printer makes a clicking noise when you fist start it up. Brother customer service says this is normal! What ever you do, do not fill the paper try too high, the machine will jam. By to high I mean lower than the trays capacity. I am very disappointed with this model. The old HL-5140 was the best laser printer I ever had. This model is border line junk. Plus the new software does not support my Apple Airport Extreme, like the HL-5140 did. Customer support says there are some glitches with OS 10.5.2., so I can't go wireless, a real bummer! Good luck if you purchase this printer. Another disappointment.Update-Do not try to run envelopes thru this printer! They are almost impossible to put in the feeder properly and end up creased when they come out. Worst printer I have ever owned!"
4,Another disposable printer,"I've had pretty good luck with Brother printers. Okay speed, good print quality, last awhile. Drum units are expensive though. Once it's time to replace your drum, almost cheaper to just toss the thing and buy a new one. Buy a new drum, or spend an extra $30 and get a new printer with a new drum, new toner cartridge etc...hmmmm, tough choice."
1,It does not work,"I purchased this to use when the lights went out. Plugged it in and the light comes on. But when the electricity when off, the light did not stay on, it did not work."
3,wOULD NOT BUY AGAIN,"Bought this item because I was looking for an inexpensive night light/emergency light.This product does fill this requirement,however:As noted by other reviewers,the night light is very dim.Also,I have tried to remove the lens cover to see how easy it would be to remove the bulb.Could not do that on any of these units.Sent an email to the manufacturer,and they said push on the lens and twist.I applied quite a bit of force on all three.Nothing.Also,it would have been a bit better had they included a light sensor in this unit,but I knew it was not included."
5,Adorable and educational,"Lane Smith's new book is exactly what I come to expect from his work. Clever, snappy text and amazing illustrations. What a great way to experience a museum and learn about great art. Fun!"
5,Great book!,Granddaughter loved this book as her teacher had read it to the class and she was excited to own her own copy.
2,Very disappointing...,"After reading the reviews and do a little research on Google, I expected the Wham-O-Superball to be pretty neat. It sounded like a special bouncy ball. I can't believe I paid $5.00 (including shipping) for a ball that doesn't even bounce as high as a 50-cent bouncy ball you can buy almost anywhere. I was thoroughly disappointed."
2,unrewarding,"A whole book of characters wandering around asking ""why is this happening and how do I make it stop"". And we the reader don't have any more insight than them. Makes for an unrewarding read, especially when you're finally given some scant information at the end for why it was happening."
5,Worth the money,"I purchased this book two quarters ago for a paper I wrote on histrionic personality disorder. After reading the cases linked to histrionic, I found myself reading the rest of the book. The cases are fascinating, and the information and classifications listed inside make sense and are easy to understand. While many people say that the DSMIV is just a list of characteristics that are wrong with people, I feel that the DSMIV allowing for such classification can lead to successful diagnosis and treatment, such as behavior modification therapy or cognitive analytical therapy. This book shows that there is so much behind why people do what they do. I was also thankful to be able to buy a copy at such a ridiculously low price.I recommend this book for any person writing a college-level paper or who is interested in reading actual cases involving psychological assessments. This book is a credible reference, and I thought it was a very interesting read."
3,It's good but not the best one I have read from her!,"I love this author. I love her humor and light hearted ways.This was a sort of cute story. I kind of got lost in the vortex's and crystals and stuff like that. It did not have very much humor in it. I also got lost alittle toward the end, about 3/4 into the story.Like I said I loved all her other books, I guess everyone is entitled to have a bad day!, Right?Hushpup"
3,The One That Got Away...,"First off, I profess my love for 2 of Heywood's previous novels, ""The Berkut"" and ""The Domino Conspiracy"" - they are fantastic thrillers that should be sought out by anyone who likes the genre. ""The Snowfly"" is a mild disappointment - the dialogue of some characters is unbelievably stilted and the plot is too convoluted - his other books were much tighter. The descriptions of fishing and the fisherman's mindset, however, are extremely well drawn out and there's enough globetrotting adventure to make this worthwhile. I hope that Heywood produces books more frequently in the future."
4,Great Quality,This set is wonderful and hardy. It holds up in the dishwasher and is elegant enough for dinner parties but tasteful enough for everyday use. I loved it so much I bought a second set.
1,Don't let HD deceive you,"They've smeared HD all over this DVD player/home theatre... yet it doesn't play HD DVDs. Great, thanks, I can play my non-HD DVDs on my huge HD screen via an HDMI cable.. what's the point?"
4,"Good sound, easy set up, inputs/outputs are weak","The sound is great, and the set up was easy. It's a well-featured system and the iPod dock is great. I was looking for wireless rears and the wireless sub woofer was a very nice bonus.I would say that it's a very 'consumer' product though, and that shows up in the i/o on the back...there's no HDMI in, and there's only one HDMI out. As such, it's not a great system for switching HD sources.I use it in my living room, with a 50"" Samsung DLP and a DirectTV HD Receiver...the picture/sound combo is good enough that we now use our dedicated front projection HD home theater a lot less.All in all, it was a good buy, and I'd buy it again for the same/similar application."
1,majeur problem with the sub-woofer,"I bought this system through buy.com first and received it at home defective: the sub-woofer doesn't switch on (zero light, not even the red one while waiting for shynch). So I returned to the system to Buy.com and decided to buy it from a more reliable website ==> Amazon.comUnfortunately the new system has the same problem.. and I made sure it is not my mistake while I set up it...So now, I will bring it to the reparation center. Otherwise, I would spend the shipping fees and loose it for the second time.Hope this story will help you.Emanuele"
1,Piece of Junk,This equipment does not work. The wireless portion does not work at all....never has...This is the second one that I have owned....the first one was great...never an issue.....this one is a POS....the seller refuses to stand behind his product.....DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. I NOTICED IT WAS OUT OF STOCK....THANK GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Pretty good heater.,I have a small room with a low ceiling in my old farm house. The room is about ten feet wide and twenty five feet long. There is no other heat source but this one. This heater is a perfect fit for this drafty room. It warms the room up very nicely. I am satisified with the product and would buy another if needed.
1,"Product is not as advertise, poor quality and over price.","I purchase this product from Air & Water, only use a few times within two month and the heater is already broken. According to Air & Water review, their products are from the best qualities but if you ask me, the quality on this product is worse than cheap quality product and it's over price. It doesn't last. This is the worse product I ever purchase and it was a gift. I request a return from Air & Water, and suprisingly they do not supply you with the return label. You have to pay for it plus the shipping charge of $6.95 on the replacement. Base on the shipping rate on Amazon, 3-5 days shipping only cost $1.99 but they charge you $6.95. I don't think I would be buying this product or buying from Air & Water anymore. They have false advertisement on their product."
4,good resource,"Good biblical backing for viewpoint. Helpful in this area, as there are many resources that are not worth buying or reading."
1,Internal light broken,Opened item to set up when turn on the internal light did not work. So very disappointed. Returned via Amazon but have never received the credit back. So guess I'm out the product and the $$ of the purchase. This is why I don't like to buy through sites like this. I should of known better
5,Contemplating Eden,"In a world where industry and technology have wiped away almost all traces of the way the land used to look, it is incredibly rare to find a person who can see straight through the agricultural history of the past century. In Robert Adams book, Los Angeles Springs, he documents the landscape of Los Angeles as we often know it. But with closer investigation it becomes clear that he is showing us something different, something older. Adam shows us the distruction of land, but more importantly he shows us a hint of what the land might have looked like before it was touched by man. In doing this he not only shows us the past, but also a hope for the future."
5,Great,"They are cute, sexy and very good quality, I like how they fit and they aren't made of in a cheap manner."
2,formula+bland=rock?,"man, i guess i'm alone here except for a few of the other reviewers in not wanting to buy yet ANOTHER album that merely bites the formula that america has chosen as apparently the only way to make music and attempts to follow it adeptly. yes, they do follow the formula well but is that really something to give them five stars for?!! any moron can do that......sugarcult should go back to their roots that they showed on their earlier releases and try to rock out a little more and write songs about more than one topic. last time i caught sugarcult live at the viper room i was incredibly dismayed to find that, if i closed my eyes and just listened to the new songs, i would have sworn that the goo goo dolls had just gotten on stage. my advice is to catch the band live and see just how much better of a live band they are and pray that they realize the folly of their actions in time for the next album."
3,THE BESTEST FILM EVERED MADE,I LOVE CAULIFLOWER IT LOVES ME. THIS IS THE BESTEST FILM I HTINK ID SEEN SINCE I WAS BORNED. I LOVE IT A LOT.I GIVE IT FIVE STARS BUT NOT ON HERE BECAUSE I WANT ROOM FOR BETTER FILMS MADE SINCE THEN.BYE.
5,The beauty in music,"See and hear Julia Fischer is delight in the beauty of music and the beauty of the violin, or is it the reverse?After all, the orchestra and the stage. Production well cared for and worthy of being admired just listening or watching too."
2,Hide from Bobby,"This isn't a good song, believe me. I keep trying to figure out what makes him think that this recording is worthy of distribution, even if it was just to his family. The only explanation I have is that the owner of the studio he frequents doesn't have any other customers. I'm convinced that the 'producer' also does the back up vocals (which are so insanely bad they're almost worth the $6.99 if you don't have to pay for shipping) and plays keyboards.Listen - don't buy this."
1,Haven't even read it..,"I haven't even read it, but the picture on the cover shows a RIDICULOUS way to perform an armbar. His legs are in a position that is not effective and this mistake is a no-no in Judo and BJJ."
5,Taking a Bite Out of Crime,"""Blood Ties"" is about a visually impaired female private investigator who teams up with a 500-year-old male vampire to solve supernatural cases. Throw in an ex-partner to spice things up. While Vicki is solving cases she's torn between her ex-partner, Mike, and the dangerous, sexy, and exciting vampire, Henry. It has everything vampire fans love- good story lines, supernatural elements, perfect casting, and lots of heat between the 3 main characters. ""Blood Ties"" is a victim of bad timing- if it had come out a few years later I'm sure it would still be on the air."
1,Blood ties did have great music!!!!,"What can i say about blood ties!! unlike forever knight and moonlight, They stayed in the occult. not worth buying!!! every show was and is about that now. No originality at all. that being said. Henry Fitzroy was the only reason i watched it anyway. I always fast forwarded to see him, he is one hot vampire.He oozed with sex appeal. why he wanted Vicki is beyond me, he could have anyone. The acting in the show was pretty bad. the only person who could act was henry and mike. I certaintly don't miss the show at all. It was way too dark. Why don't vampires show every focus on vampires instead of unneeded things? maybe that is why they are being cancelled. I do give five stars for the music. the music was amazing. they should have released a cd!!"
2,Get Smart: the complete series,"This is not the original series from 1963, it's got Don Adams and Barbara Feldon but they're married and old and have a son played by Andy Dick and he's working with agents 86 and 99 as a callow secret agent and obviously inherited Max's stupidity. In my opinion, I'd say it's weak at best. I'll stick with the original any day."
4,Standard GA training book,"This book has good illustrations of basic aeronautical concepts. Many companies make big bucks making new versions of this. This book is government issue, so the information is public domain. IE, printing costs are less due to no licensing fees.I would say that, compared to the Jeppesen Guided Discovery book, or many of the other similar ones, this book is probably about 85% of ease of absorption, but about 15% of the price.This book can be downloaded from the FAA in PDF. I highly recommend both the PDF and the print copies, but the PDF edition is free."
1,men's face product,"It arrived in okay time. The description wasn't clear that it's a mens product. I don't have any use for this product, being I'm a women. I still have not received a refund"
4,"Modern, but....","This book is a proper subset of Lang's later book ""Fundamentals of Differential Geometry (Graduate Texts in Mathematics, 191)""."
2,Oh this is SO wrong..,"- first of all despite being marked as ""in stock"" only part of order was in fact in stock. I.e 1 sheet. Other 6 arrived week later.- secondly it is not 12x12. It is in fact 11.5x11.5. Which really screwed my project up.- thirdly few of sheets were bulging. Not flat by any means."
3,"It's good, but not great.","Okay okay... This album is quite a letdown, to be honest. It's got some great bits to it... Each song is beautiful, but they don't go anywhere...The best track is easily Scarborough Fair or Malcom's Loop, but the problem is all the tracks on the CD sound exactly the same.Lost in Space has some great pianowork, as does Urban Fox.Twisted Standards and Cutting Branches are rich in rhythm but lack melody and both are too bright sounding.Irish in China and In Five are both average and the whole album was well put together, it just needed some variation.Salvage is a wonderful album, don't get me wrong, you should buy it if you're a fan of the sound pioneered by the Afro Celt Sound System, just pickup thier 1994 release first.. It's much better."
3,"The American Promise, Volumes 1 and 2","This book omits several important events in U. S. History up to 1865. But is sufficient for introductory classes in U. S. History. While it does a sufficient job as a survey source, it is not recommended for an in-depth study of any period in U. S. History. Further, Roark seems to emphasize some events that seem less important to U. S. History."
3,Fails in comparison to the book.,"Taken by itself, this isn't too bad as science fiction movies go. But it is far inferior to the book by Balmer and Wylie. (To be fair, of course, few films measure up to the books on which they're based). However, it also does not attain the status of true classic that belongs to other sci-fi films of the era such as ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""."
2,I confess -- I wanted to like this book ...,"... but De Noux didn't make it easy. Grammatical and punctuation errors abound, including numerous slips such as ""he"" instead of ""the,"" and ""I'll"" instead of ""I'm."" Frustrating! Also, De Noux is in need of a good (as in ruthless) editor. His ideas are great, and he has a good eye for color. However, he needs someone to occasionally rein him in when he gets too maudlin or bitter-sounding. Still, this collection of stories clearly shows his improvement as a writer over time, especially when he moves away from a first-person narrative. That being said, police officers, crime reporters and other crime junkies will likely still enjoy this book, as I did after forgiving the author his trespasses."
2,Facile and Simplistic,"I bought this book out of curiosity, having enjoyed seeing Joyce Meyer preach on television. Her down-to-earth approach to Christianity has obviously drawn a large audience.This book was a disappointment. I had the impression it was probably written in a week or less, once an outline was generated.Fighting the 'bulge' in middle age, I found Mrs. Meyer's approach to eating and overeating quite simplistic. We are still learning the root causes of obesity. We can all state, 'eat sensibly and exercise more'; that's nothing new. I can look in my Bible for all references to eating and gluttony; it wasn't a problem for society when the Bible was written. As much as I love my Bible, it isn't a guidebook for controlling overeating, and neither is Mrs. Meyer's book.This book would've worked better as a brochure at a fraction of this price. DON'T expect to see anything new or enlightening in this book, it ain't there."
2,How about a mounting strap?,"Every ceiling light and ceiling fan I've ever bought has included a mounting bracket (mounting strap in instructions) that attaches to the utility box. But not Thomas Lighting/1STOPlighting. What are you trying to save $.08 per fixture. So, I ""schlep"" to Home Depot for a universal bracket @ $2.37 and you lose a customer for life. Plus this review. Way to ""count your beans"" and turn a big profit. For an even bigger profit...don't include the expensive wire nuts."
1,Cheap quality and short lived,"The piece that actually grabs the film is, itself, a piece of film. Flimsy and broken easily - if your film roll hangs up it'll tear the little hooks. Complete was of money. In the end I bought a metal version."
1,Photography Lighting Book Review,Terrible format and poor editing. It looks like the author made some Xerox copies along withsome notes scribbled with a Sharpie marker. The entire book is in black and white. Photos look like they were taken with a disposable camera not a pro photographer's SLR. Very disappointed with this book. Not much usable information. Do not recommend this book.
1,No fit,The pen fits into the hole of Tungsten T but does not stay in. You have to keep it separated from the Palm. It is not the proper pen for this model. The original stays in and pops out when you press it's top.
4,Subtle Intrigue,"If your expecting riveting action, then don't see this movie. If you want to be kept in suspense and not know what you just watched, but loved the evolution of circumstance and characters, then watch this movie! This movie will be a classic one day. It's like opening the middle of a great book that the author never finished, but that doesn't matter because the author is such a great writer. Movie aficionados will appreciate the director's vision."
1,For men who stare at Clooney (staring back at us),"In this movie Clooney stares at you and you stare back at him for 90% of the time.In between scenes, to keep your attention, they show him having sex with Claire (Violante Placido), boobs exposed etc etc.And in the end he kills the big-bad guy who is trying to kill him and dies.Havent watched such a turd of a movie in a long time!"
1,soooooooooo boring,"I guess some people will think my review isn't fair, but this was so freakin' boring I couldn't finish it. With all the hype and great ""reviews"" on the box I was expecting something exciting and suspenseful or at least entertaining. Nope. Don't waste your money buying this. Rent it from the library or watch it online if you have some time to waste."
1,"Finally ,an Insomia cure!","I couldnt go to sleep,so i watched this movie,halfway thru it ,I fell asleep.next day,watched the segements i missed,and fell into sleep anew.this movie is one hell of a trash!i bet ,besides the talent fees of the actors,directors and the crew and cost equipment, the producer/s didnt spend more than 10K on the props.I wouldnt be surprised,if they filmed it less than a week.the producers duped thousands of moviegoers,whilst they laughing all the way to the bank! shame on you greedy people!"
1,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time,Has the look and feel of a foreign film and is just so extremely slow and boring I am amazed it even got published. I wouldn't even want to own it for free.
1,One of worst films Ive ever seen,"This is one of the worst films Ive ever seen1. photography was horrible; showing perhaps some of the uglier parts of Italy2. setting of movieWHERE IS EVERYONE ?towns and streets pretty much vacant, I thought maybe they've been lifted by aliensmost of time, he's walking around streets totally absent of people.not even a good premise for an assassin vs assassin film.Why did he have to stay in the crappy little town?Why was he wide open to be an easy target?only people in town are prostitutes and hit-girlsa priest and hit-menweirdcadence and rhythm of film equally horribleGag"
1,DON'T waste your money,"Worst movie I've seen in my 46 years of life. George is just using his name to sell tickets and DVD's. Slow, Plotless, Unimaginative, shame on you people for making us think this would be a good movie!"
1,ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz . . . . . . . .,"Very relaxing movie - no dialogue, no acting, no discernible plot. My wife and I lasted about 30 minutes into the movie and then left to watch our lawn grow. BTW - I gave it one star because no stars was not an option."
1,Enough to swear-off Clooney movies forever,"I've been a George Clooney fan for years and, as such, have come to accept that you don't quite know what you may get from one movie to the next. Some have been quite good; others pretty forgetable... This one, though, is more unforgiveable...Part of the problem is the trailer, which I found misleading. This is neither an action film nor a thriller - as the trailer infers - but more of a drama.The rest of the problem is the film is pretty uneven and ends rather inexplicably and abruptly. After enduring all the pensive moments and dragging pace of this film, it wraps things up in a matter of seconds.I saw the movie with a couple friends and we all looked at each other at the end and said the same thing - ""Is that it?!?"" And after processing what we'd just sat through, we came to the same conclusion: we're done with Clooney films. This one was too great a sucker punch and too much a waste of time.Sorry, George!"
2,Very cheap acting,I would have expected a better film with George Clooney. In all a fairley good flick. Bought it on demand.
5,Misjudged film,"One of the best films of 2010, but only a few people think so. Sure this film isn't for everyone. It's slow, deliberate, methodical, and detailed. It's fascinated with images more than action. It presents small character movements instead of large story arcs. And for what it's trying to achieve, it's perfectly shot, acted, and directed. And for those who love the pure cinema, it's the perfect kind of film."
4,Nicely done,"This is a great movie filmed in great locations. It was suspenseful throughout, not a typical spy thriller, but a simple yet nuance plot. Clooney was great. Very understated. The opening scene is a stunner, sets the stage for the rest of the film."
2,Eye Candy,"A summation of the story line is: ""Someone is after you,I don't know who,I don't know why.""Throw in some High School philosophy from a local priest and we have covered most of the dialog.Now we come to the eye candy:1. Italian countryside, some great scenic shots.2. George Clooney in his pajama bottoms exercising.3. Thekla Reuten in designer outfits.4. Violante Placido in no outfit.Repeat as required until we have filled 105 minutes.If you are a huge George Clooney fan, hold off and pick this up from the reminder rack at Wal-Mart."
3,This would have been a great movie in Italian,"The movie has no real storyline. And once one realizes what the storyline is, its over. Would have been great in Italian or French, but for a Clooney movie, pretty lame."
2,The American,Unclear and Confusing. Too many frames unrelated to the story line. So what ifa tatooed Clooney can do pullups.
1,Horrible boring movie,"I'm disgusted that I paid 14.99 for this crap, other reviewers gave it a high rating, I dont understand why! I'm not even going to get into the plot, read it on some happy reviewers page, not mine, I'm done with this movie...into the garbage it goes"
2,"Typical ""Africa is so different"" condescending book","The two stars are for the writing, which is, itself, quite good. But the topic, and the way it is presented is offensive. ""'Africans' are wierd and soooo different"" is the main message--I gave up halfway through because, as much as I was intrigued by the subject matter, the author's approach to his subject was so disrespectful, that I cringed to think that the author had actually lived in Ivory Coast himself, and ""represented America"" there."
5,Being there,This writer creates a picture of his enviornment that leaves you breathless. I read this in one sitting and hated to see the stories end. This writer has a way with words that puts you right there with him.
5,Dreamcast is better than PS2,I've played both systems and I honestly like and play dreamcast more than playstation 2. This system is awesome. Awesome graphics(in most games it is better than PS2.) It comes with 2 of the best games ever invented. It's not even so much more expensive than the system without any games. Don't waste your money on PS2. Just get Dreamcast and trust me you will be happy you did so. What are you doing reading? Go out and buy it! SEGA DREAMCAST NFL 2K NBA 2K
4,"Not a 2-pack, no cases","The description and user photo indicated this would be a two-pack of SD cards, and the photo showed they came with plastic cases. What I received was two individually wrapped SD cards, without cases. Slightly misleading, and I'll add a photo later that will show two separate cards, so people will know what they are getting.Shipping was quick and packing was good. These will be presents so I won't get to use the cards themselves to review."
1,MISLEADING!,Instead of a multi-pack with cases I received 2 individual SD cards without cases. Not very happy because they are going to be given to relatives for their digital photo frames and it seems so cheap to hand them an uncased card that could get damaged. I have to open the packages up and load them with pictures before Christmas so they won't be packaged or cased when I hand them over. :(
1,NOT BRAND NEW OR SEALED,"The picture showed that this is a brand new, sealed item - IT IS NOT!!!! It is NOT SEALED, so how do I know if it's used and been reformatted? Or if it's corrupt???? VERY MISLEADING!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,SanDisk 2 GB SD,It's difficult to find the older SD Flash cards these days for my 3 year old Kodak digital camera. Everything is the HDSD now. The price was great and the memory cards are PERFECT! Thanks you.
2,SanDisk 2 GB SD Flash Memory Card 2-pack,I received wrong memory type. It is SDHC not SD and so they don't work with my device. Sent email but did not get any response.
5,Hard to find,We have an older digital camera which will only handle a maximum of 2GB memory card. Glad to find this item available at a reasonable price.
3,Convenient way to carry,These seem to be a better way to carry data than a bulkier USB stick. They work fine on my Mac's.
4,See them live,"We saw them last night, playing for free in front of the Euclid Public Library. A great show. I expect it might be even better with a few beers. And we bought the CD. Have been listening to it all morning. Most interesting cover of Dead Skunk. Iko Iko is great as well. Not sure about the vocals on Hey Trudy. Fiddle player does the vocals on this song, and she does a good job, but nothing spectacular. Good value, good driving CD."
1,Cross-dresser impersonates Great Author,"As a devout fan of Orwell (Eric Blair), I think it bizarre, presumptuous, pompous, pretentious and simply ridiculous to hide behind a female pseudonym, such as Dawn Blair. This chutzpah could only be created by someone intent on milking a few bucks out of Orwell's British surname to promote a rather silly agenda. Perhaps you should consult Blair's estate before cashing in on the family name."
4,good movie,"grandson likes this movie, but it is not up the standards set by one and ten in the set. worth buying."
1,Teaches small children bad behavior!,"My almost-three-year-old had been watching these movies for weeksand I didn't figure out until recently that they have been teaching him bad behavior. First of all, one of the little dinosaurs screams constantly throughout these videos and this teaches little kids to scream just to make noise. The movies are also filled with smart-alec, bratty language that kids watching it will pick up on, like: ""See you, wouldn't want to be you"", and screaming, ""Its not fair!"" while stomping their feet. One of the movies has a scene where the kid dinosaurs are going to ""Show the grown ups that we aren't babies anymore"" by disobeying their parents and venturing into a dangerous swamp that they were told to stay out of.There are so many good children's movies out there that teach good values and behavior. This is not one of them, however, andas a parent I recommend not bringing it home."
4,"Mesmerizingly bad, but hilarious.","These four stars are there both for levels of hilarty. One, mind numbingly awful songs. Two, bad voice work. Three, the sappy cornyness. Four, a few good intese scenes. I guess I should expect this since I'm not a 6 year old who loves all animated films. This could be for people who love a good laugh. Think of it as a well animated PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE eithout the plot meets musicals about dinosaurs. For those who don't understand, I am talking about it's direct to video quality. Peace out!"
5,a master piece,"A great anime show, that is to some extend scary !. Never before i've seen a samurai show that leans toward horror theme. Great attention to story and characters development and visual arts.The bad news is the anime demonstrates only the first few chapters of the novel of which its based on.Very sad indeed . . ."
3,Goddess Kali,"I am an absolute beginner. The technique section is broken down and she talks too much and it was difficult to stand there listening to long winded breakdown of moves. In the warm-up section and practise I liked it but her voice over instructions weren't clear. (She goes from one extreme to the other by painstakingly talking through the breakdown, then in the practical warm-up and practise the voice over instructions are unclear and a bit vague). I haven't done the choreography yet as I'm not up to that level in my skill, so I won't comment on that. I thought her performances were arty and her costumes were unflattering - her style of performance was like her own style of contemporary dance rather than bellydance."
1,Prose to nod off to sleep to,"Dragons of Autumn Twilight markets itself as fantasy, but if the readers of this boring little novel want to feel any sense of wonder, I am afraid it will only come from wondering why you ever spent your hard-earned dollars on such a plotless, poorly written, miserable and dull old book. Dragons of Autumn Twilight fails at just about every level a book is capable of failing at.Don't even bother going to the library to read this silly tale - your time is just far too valuable. I will never be reading anything by Weis and Hickman again."
3,I haven't read any Dragonlance books and don't intend to.,"I am a fan of The Lord of the Rings. According to the reviews I have read, Dragonlance books are much worse. I gave this book 3 stars because that's what I would probably think of it if I read it."
3,For the plane and rain,"Although I can no longer remember their names, I thoroughly enjoyed the first few series written by these authors. Unfortunately this book is nothing special and I have no desire to get Volume 2. It contains the usual dungeons and dragons cast of characters. Yawn. Good to borrow for the plane ride or spending the day in your hotel room when your vacation is more rain than sun."
2,An Adequate Story with Average Writing,"I'm afraid I really have to agree with the reader from Dallas two messages below. There are a lot (an awful lot) of folks who hold this series in high merit, but I was barely able to finish this first book. The writing is so filled with cliches, stale dialog, and stereotypical characters that I couldn't bring myself to move on to the second book. The only saving grace was the overall plot itself was somewhat interesting.If you're just coming off of Tolkien or Jordan and are looking for further Fantasy (or if you are just used to high-quality writing), I wouldn't really recommend this series unless you can accept a novel written towards, what I would consider, an 11th-grade target audience."
2,"A good hook, shoddily concealed","I must admit that I'll read just about anything. I nearly stopped reading this book, and I'm still debating returning it to the used bookstore, along with the rest of the series.The plot is disjointed, which is explained in the after word.The authors modified the plot based on gaming sessions that they had during the project. Although the scenes derived from those sessions are memorable and humorous their integration causes the greatest holes in the story line.I occasionally felt that I was being slapped in the face with game mechanics. This is bad enough during a role-playing session, and I find it unacceptable in a novel.The ending in addition to the books role as a successful hook into the rest of the series is what spares this book a single star."
5,Magnificent,"I started the Chronicles series when i was in 7th grade. Since then I have read over 50 of the Dragonlance books. The main 8, however, are still the best, with no comparison. The Chronicles, Legends, Second Generation, and Summer Flame are a few of the best books in print!!!"
5,"If You can Read Only One Dragonlance Book, Make it this One!","To me, this is the Dragonlance book that started it all. This is where the, arguably, most important characters in the Dragonlance series really come into play, and start on their greatest adventure ever. Weis and Hickman do an excellent job of using rich, vivid wording to bring out all of Krynn's features. If you like this book, I can guarantee you'll like its sequels: Dragons of Winter Night and Dragons of Spring Dawning."
4,Quite a good introduction to an outstanding Trilogy,"Yes the characterization was slightly weak, and the introduction a little slow, but overall this is a great book eventhough its not the best one in the trilogy, Dragons of Winter Night is my favorite. Even though I have read and enjoyed classical literature by Huxley, Orwell, Fitzgerald and Shakespeare I still love this trilogy. I think it has nothing to do with the refinement of one's palette but rather taking things for what they are, not what they could represent. I think this trilogy tought me a lot about self sacrifice and so forth. I highly recommend this book and the trilogy. Put away your reservations about historical accuracy and other irrelevent things and pickup this great book."
2,Disappointing,"Like the other books following the original Dragonlance series and the ""War of the Twins"" books, this disappoints. Why do Weis and Hickman think a world without magic will interest fantasy fans? We get that in real life. The inglorious endings of beloved characters are extremely unsatisfying. One must wonder if the authors are simply tired of writing this series."
3,hmmm... not entirely what I expected.,"I was not very impressed by this book. It is fantasy, sure... but it is simply not original. The story is predictable and the characters are the same old stereotype, cut and paste characters you get in every other mainstream fantasy novel.I suppose I should have expected this since Dragonlance is a RPG-based story and therefore follows a certain recipe, but I was still disappointed. I mean, the world of Dragonlance has grown to an unbelievable size - surely there must be something great about it? Well there isn't, it is pretty average. Not bad, I didn't say that. The Dragonlance chronicles is still a worthy fantasy book to read, but I will not go beyond the first 3 books. Once you've read these, I believe you will have a clear concept of Krynn. If you liked what you saw, read some more of the other 90 or something Dragonlance books. If however you feel like me, call it a closed chapter and move on to greener grounds."
4,Love this espresso maker considering the cost and ease of use,"It works great, easy, quiet. My only complaint is you are locked in to buying a specific nespresso capsule and that is my only complaint."
5,best espresso,"this Nespresso machine is perfect; it is small, fits in any kitchen, the espresso is nice and strong (flavor; Ristretto). It saves us lots of money, no more visits to the Starbucks & Donkin Donuts. very happy with the machine and coffee flavors."
3,Johnny Is No Ryan,"The 3rd season of Friday the 13th continued the innovative curses and excellent production values of Seasons 1 and 2, but the show really missed John D. LeMay as the male lead.His replacement, Stephen Monarque, just isn't a very good actor. His voice is an annoying, high-pitched squeak. His character really doesn't fit into the action well or establish any chemistry with the other characters. The producers' attempts to create sexual sparks between him and the beautiful Robey result in scenes that are awkward, unreal, and distracting.The 3rd season's shows are still good, but Seasons 1 and 2 are better examples of this series operating on all cylinders."
3,Hmm,"Well, there isn't much to say. This DVD, and the last of the episodes of Vol. 5 doesn't quite do it for me. It's the robotech 1 generation conclusion, so why is it so half hearted. Robotech is great, no doubt about that, but after the war, these last few episodes just conclude a soap opera that has been going back and forth all episodes. So it has really gotten old.Robotech forever! But, there are better 80's anime's outhere, like Thundersub, Jace and the Wheel Warriors, Transformers, Saber Riders, Macron 1!..... Who don't these get propper DVD's?"
1,very disappointed,"I ordered ""Zippo wolf black ice"", but what I received are ""polished chrome wolf Zippo"". I also think Wolf would look better on black. The seller is Amazon. I'm very disappointed with Amazon this time."
4,frederick douglass,a real eye opener..Should be on the corriculum for grade 11 or 12. Amazing that I am just finding out how the slaves were treated and that the book is almost 200 years old.
2,"A Marked Deck, A House Of Cards","Piece by piece the Randle/Schmitt mound of ""evidence"" has been whittled away since the book was published, leaving a hulking heap of rumor, innuendo, misperception, distorted memory, and ""witness"" fabrication to play around with. I went back and read this book again to confirm that view after I had read COSMIC TEST TUBE. It has a chapter on Roswell that makes the strongest possible case for an extraterrestrial event, then the author turns around and demolishes the extraterrestrial argument using logic and the evidence for a secret Mogol balloon launch. Subsequent events have bolstered his analysis!"
3,Good Idea. Room for Improvement.,"These clips are handy for getting your poles out of the way when the are not needed; e.g. when you'd like to eat an energy snack; drink a beverage while still on-the-go, or consult a map, etc. They hold fast onto the poles, but can easily slip off your pack if you're not careful (it's no fun re-tracing your steps to look for a missing pole). This is where Leki could look for a better fastening system. Though I've lost one of a pair, I'm buying them again as I've gotten used to being able to hitch up my poles when and where I want."
1,Product Not as Described,"We were very disappointed in this item and returned it. It is described as being 13.2 x 10.0 x 7 inches when it actually measures 6 x 5.5 x 4.5 inches. It you are looking for a nice little item to put on a shelf - this is it. If you are looking for books for a child to handle and enjoy, these are too small."
4,Nice overview of Elvis' First Year,"This short but sweet documentary features interviews with Scotty Moore, and many others that were involved with Elvis's first year in the business. The great thing about this doc is, it covers a lot of ground that hasn't been covered before.For Elvis fans only."
1,I DON'T GET IT !,"I don't quite understand why everyone thinks this CD is sogood. The members of this band all came from bands that werefantastic. The music does however have a catch to it that draws your attention and make you want to listen to it anyway, but still, compared to At The Gates, this band is poor. I would compare it more to Rage Against the Machine. Bottom line is, you'll probably like this CD because everyone else seems to, but I really just don't get it."
1,Don't believe the other reviews--this book is awful!,"Based on the other Amazon reviews, I bought this book for my husband as a light-hearted present for his first Father's Day, since we're expecting our first child in a month. He has a great sense of humor, and I thought he would appreciate it. However, he found the book to be rude and mean-spirited, and after he read excerpts from the first two chapters to me, I have to agree.Here's an example: ""As an intelligent, devoted new parent (who also happens to be grossly undertalented) what, exactly, do you believe your new role should be? That is, without making a spectacle of yourself, how can you contribute? The answer is simple: STAY OUT OF THE PICTURE!""He kept reading, hoping to get some actual parenting advice and get to the punchline, but received neither. I'm so embarrassed that I actually gave this to him as a gift."
1,What a let down,I dont like this stuff at all. I dont feel fresh. I have tried other brand that actually works. I will be going back to that one. Very disappointed :-(
2,Un poco decepcionada,"A pesar de haber constituido el premio fémina, es un libro un poco denso. Solo en pocos momentos te sientes sumergida en la historia, la cual pierde poco a poco la emoción, llegando a tener un final bastante correntón. No obstante, está muy bien como el autor redacta las cartas y en dependencia del personaje mantiene un tipo de vocabulario y comportamiento el cual no varía hasta el final del libro dándolo cierta credibilidad.Si estás dispuesto a pasar algunos ratos vacíos por conocer la no fabulosa historia de una mujer entorno a dos hombres y sus hijos, la caja negra es sin duda una opción complaciente.Cynthia Alvarez Alonso"
1,You will be disappointed!,"This was definitely a waste of money. I purchased this for my grandson for Christmas. He was so excited because he had seen it on the internet and wanted it. It was disappointing that the music only lasted about 7 or 8 seconds - 1 phrase of the song. After just a few plays, it quit working. It had not even been taken out of the box. The batteries were changed the next day, but that didn't help much. It did work a few minutes, then quit again. My son finally just took it out of the box so my grandson could at least carry it around. I would not waste money buying another one unless it actually worked! We were all disappointed in the quality of this product."
5,A solution to the longstanding paradoxes of logic.,Angell offers solutions to many of the standard paradoxes of truth functional logic. This is a masterpiece.
2,Not a good cam at all.,"Not as I expected for a name like Leica's. the cam is expensive for nothing important. When you use the video recording, you can not change the zoom at all. The only advantage I noticed in this cam is the ability to take wide pictures. But still, this is not worth 600$. Besides, the cam is big. Compared to Canon cams, half the price for almost all the capabilities.My advice: Do not buy, get a Canon for 200$. In that case if you want to get another cam after 2 years, you wont feel bad for the money you paid."
5,This was a really good and interesting book,This book shows its readers the lives of two of the best pairs skaters ever. Isabelle and Lloyd talk about their lives before skating together and during the most trying times of their careers. There is also a look at what their lives are like off the ice. This book has a small tribute to Sergei Grinkov. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes figure skating or a good autobiography.
4,Nice Game,"If youlike the original Cubis game, this one is just as fun, but a little more challenging."
3,"Very cool, but...","I never thought the day would come when I would own Godflesh videos on DVD. Most of these were only available in PAL format from the UK and have never been seen overseas. I do have ""Crush My Soul"" on a Earache promotional tape previous to this. It's a great DVD, but, and I don't know if this is just my DVD, the video quality of ""Crush My Soul"" and ""Mothra"" are questionable. Electronic grain runs rampant through each video and I wonder if something happened in the re-mastering process. I compared my VHS tape version of ""Crush My Soul"" with the DVD version and it looks a lot cleaner. What's up with this? Anyone else have this problem? I've emailed Earache about it but no response so far."
1,Poor fit quality,"The item fit so-so at best the bottom of the main section is too short and only floats at the bottom. Since it has been installed the summer heat has warped it and now the top section has a gap in it. This is just a poor quality product. I have written the maker with no reply. Poor quality and a poor customer service. Don't buy it. Ihave bough Metra kits before and they have worked well in the past but this specific item, I will be replacing with another brand."
5,WOW,Great workout- I could do this everyday! It's over before you even realize it! It keeps you moving the whole time!
1,Disappointment,"Billy is always motivational and encouraging, BUT this workout was a HUGE disappointment. I have purchased several of Billy Blanks's products in the past, but I stopped buying them because I noticed that they were extremely repetitive with the moves. Each workout seemed exactly the same. After reading the back of the Cardio Inferno DVD, I decided to buy it. It claimed that, ""Billy has created the best cardio workout to ever hit the fitness world"" and that the DVD ""will test your cardiovascular willpower like never before."" I was expecting new moves and to work hard. I felt like I waited the entire workout for it to actually get going which it never seemed to do. I was very ready for a new challenge but this workout was considerably lacking. The DVD also claimed that it included ""a fun fueled 1 hour workout"" which is why I was very shocked when the cool down started at 40 minutes.. Like I said, this DVD was a huge disappoinment. I will def stick to P90X."
1,Very Disappointed,I am a huge fan of Billy Blanks! But i was very disappointed in this DVD! He talks way to much! I felt like I was standing more often then working out. I would not recommend this DVD!
3,too bac it is not higher quality,"the wiring is weak like most outlet splitters. if it was not for that it would be perfect for the radar detector, ipod, cell phone and GPS"
4,Works as expected,"Bought as a replacement for another brand device, this one works as well if not better. Keep a silver dime available if you need to remove it for some reason."
4,No more choking in the car:,"Since I bought this little gadget from Amazon, both my hands are free to drive. No need to pull at the seat belt to avoid choking. What a relief. I feel safer now because I am not distracted anymore by the constant nuisance of a seat belt against my neck. I recommend it wholeheartedly."
2,look for another seat belt adjuster,"This product is a lightweight plastic clip which is designed to hold the upper seat belt away from your neck by latching it to the lap belt. The plastic is not strong enough to do this, and the plastic bar which clips into the adjuster pops out. Look for another option."
3,Hmm.... A bit moody,"First, it's very fragile. First time I attempted to put it on, it has broke. then, when it works, it's a bit slidy - it doesn't always stay and moves along the seat belt. I mean, it is working ok, but moody. Also, I was in a car crash and it broke like a toothpick, even though the hit was not bad enough to deploy the airbags..."
1,Don't Buy,Don't waste your money on this. Neither one of the 2 clips in the package would stay fastened for even a short time. They constantly pop open with even a small amount of pressure on the seat belt.
3,Your mileage may vary,"The clip snaps together and is easy to install, making it possible to adjust the position of the shoulder strap so it does not rub against your neck and crosses your chest more comfortably. On the downside, the tension pulls the lap belt up and presses the hard plastic clip into my tummy. For me it just trades one discomfort for another, so I don't bother with it. For a few bucks, it's worth a try if you are experiencing discomfort from the shoulder strap."
4,Seat Belt Adjuster,"Having gone through breast cancer, this adjuster helps to take the pressure off of the shoulder whendriving. It is very useful to me."
4,Keeps belt from cutting across my neck.,"While I love the safety that the three point seat belt delivers, I was always bugged by the shoulder slipping across my neck, especially in the summer when I don't wear a coat or jacket. This seat belt strap adjuster stays out of the way when it's not used and allows me to adjust the harness so that it doesn't slip across my neck while wearing it. My one minor complaint it that the adjuster doesn't lay flat across my lap when I do use it."
1,They don't work.,"They slip and slide and won't stay in place. After putting them on per the instructions, I found that they wouldn't hold in place. Every time the seat belt was used, they would slide around, pop out, or had to be readjusted. Don't waste your money on these novelty items. Cheap plastic; worthless product."
1,poor quality,This product snapped and broke the first time used. It is very thin and did not hold the seat belt well at all. It is not recommended.
5,Wouldn't go without it now,"If you are short like me, you know about the seat belt cutting across you neck. It is so irritating and you are constantly pulling the belt away from your neck trying to get it to stay somewhere (anywhere) else. This little thing is not perfect but it is a major improvement. It makes it to where the belt can come up from the middle of your torso instead of the side or you can adjust the clip to wherever you like along the bottom belt."
2,Inconvenient Tool,"Sure the World Industries Hellbilly skatetool is robust, but with this robustness comes a price. The skatetool is heavy and you can definitely get more better and more functional skatetools for about the same price. I already gave this away to a friend after I got something lighter. Not to mention, if you keep this in your pocket and fall on it, it WILL hurt."
5,Great gift,"I bought this for a friend who is a Jiminy Cricket fan and when I got it, I had a different impression from the one I saw on the amazon page. The real one is very very beatiful.You will not be disappointed. My friend was more than happy with it."
1,Sham!,"Do not buy this item. It is erroneously advertized as having a thermometer also which it does not. I call that fraudulent or deceptive marketing. Substandard quality with ""rubber-like"" band. Was totally unimpressed with this item. I would rather spend more to buy a brand that you get what is offered."
4,song,i was looking for the song cut me into to pieces by jean beauvior & dee dee ramone i heard it on the movie rockin roll high school forever starr corey feldman and ever since i heard the song i been looking everywhere but i can't find it
3,Decent Gary Moore CD,"I personally liked ""Blues Alive"" and ""Best of the Blues"" better than this CD. Check out the soundbytes of the other CDs before buying this one."
5,As Good as Acting Gets,"Emma Thompson surpasses her previous work in my view. There is an almost palpable sense that no ""acting"" is taking place: the character simply exists in a reality without art. Of course this is a way of defining transcendent art.The direction is superb as well.What is deficient is the lack of special features on the DVD. This is inexcusable, especially the lack of any commentary from Ms. Thompson who co-wrote the screenplay along with Mike Nichols. Surely, interviews with one or both would not be prohibitively expensive. Shame on HBO.See this film. It is not maudlin, as the subject matter might lead one to expect. It is simply true."
1,Hype,Do not believe the hype on this film.It is not the great film it's made out to be.The only thing that saves this film is Emma Thompsons performance but it is not the performance of her career.This film did not win any awards at the Berlin film festival.This is just another run of the mill TV movie.
1,"Take everyone's advice guys, this book leaves you hanging.","I read most of the reviews for this book. I don't usually post reviews. But I just had to for this one because every time I read it, it leaves me wondering and asking more questions. It seems so superficial since it gives you a gist of what's going on (like stuff that's happening 5 years ago) and we are in 2006. I look for Park Hotel Tokyo. Not there. They opened in 2003, shouldn't they be in that guidebook? That revision was done later than that. So I took a trip to my local Borders store, and took a look at TimeOut Tokyo's guide book. That book was so much more informative, I really wished I could get a refund. Trust me, this book, sucks."
3,Nuetral about this,"Purchased this as a gift for a friend who had managed to break her old one. She thinks it is great, but I really can't comment as I have never used it personally, thus my neutral comment"
2,Not Pyrex / shatter-proof glass,"Not a good quality product: the glass beaker is not Pyrex or shatter-proof. The unit fell 4 inches onto a wooden countertop and shattered.It is a 1 cup unit -- not 3 cups as described (perhaps 3 demi-tasse cups, at best)."
4,MUSIC,"I WAS ALITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE RECORDING QUALITY OF THIS CD, AS SOME OF THE HYMNNS VERY HARD TO HEAR"
2,A bit dissapointing,"I think I gave this fewer stars than I would normally would've...only because I'm used to the quality work of ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" and ""Allosaurus"". These titles are not just visual splendors; they match every visual spectacle with a didatic counterpart...oh yeah...it helps to have Kenneth Branaugh as the narrator as well...not the boring Jonathan Goodman.Overall, entertaining, but if you must own something that is well created, well based in fact, and didactic, look to the BBC series ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" and ""Allosaurus""."
3,Mediocre.,"Animation wasn't that good. Also, John Goodman mispronounced several dinosaur names (Anatatatotitan instead of Anatotitan).In too many scenes, they made the earth shake. Discovery has improved their CGI in more recent years. Still, if you're not too picky, I guess it's reasonable."
2,Less than the Best,A less than stellar collection of tracks... very much lacking cohesion and continuity. I couldn't wait to take it out of my CD player. It is an unfortunate choice of music for such a noteworthy endeavor.
3,"Fun, but obviously a first novel","I grabbed this because I am a petsitter in need of note comparing! I am satisfied that she knows the real issues. (I especially agree with her about the dog park!)I was not impressed with the first chapter, but it's an easy read so I stuck it out. I don't relate to the New York personalities, but I suspect any reader would find some of her friends unbelievable (and what's with her father?!).But I thought her descriptions of the dogs were wonderful! I loved her final mission, which I won't reveal; it reflects a serious problem in the pet-owning world.I took off a whole point, though, just for the grammatical errors, which, considering her frequest mentions of being an editor, were quite inexcusable. (She gets the ""lay"" and ""lie"" verbs mixed up, and not just when quoting. Was there an editor or proofreader for this book?)"
5,Fun and interesting! Couldn't put the book down! :),"Im do Pet sitting/dog walking on the side and I saw this book I had to buy it. It was fun, romantic, and love the mystery element to the story too. I couldn't put the book down! I told my friends about it and I said, ""This book should be made into a MOvie!"" that's how good the story is.Any animal lover, New Yorker, lover of ROmantic comedies, should read this book."
3,"Cute, but not as I expected....","This was a cute book. I did enjoy the read.However, when it initially started, I did not like the character, she was not as I expected and totally over the top.After a bit, you get attached and want to see what happens next. The book ends about how it started, totally unrealistic and somewhat annoying.Overall, it was cute book and worth a read if you're into the 'chick lit'"
4,"Worth a look, if not a buy","Leslie Schnur creates a likeable and believable heroine in Nina, the Dog Walker of the title, but she unfortunately lets the dogs run wild by the end of the novel. Don't get me wrong: there's some nice writing, intriguing plot twists and engaging psychological complexity in this book. Just stop reading before Schnur takes some very bad advice and wraps up the plot in an artificial and wildly unbelievable conclusion. If only she'd kept it simple and let the story end as life often does--without a neat, prepackaged happy ending."
1,"bad writing, mundane characters","I am so disappointed that I bought this book in hardcover. It is painful to read. I'm 1/2 way through, which has taken me over a week, and I continue to read only because of the money spent. I need to just give it up..The writing is dreadful. Ms. Schnur thinks she's funny and witty, but she is dull and trite. How could an editor let this book out in this state?? The story line is weak and you make ZERO connection with the characters.Don't waste you money. I need a new book!!!"
4,Overpriced at Amazon,"I am not sure why this book is coming up as $90 to $200 on Amazon. It is a wonderful book, but go purchase it from the Hanen website for the price of $54 instead of paying up to 4 times that for a used copy from the Amazon vendors. Not sure what is going on here..."
2,Disappointed,"I have a job working with children with special needs, so I am always on the lookout for good children's books that can be used in the classroom to introduce peers to specific exceptionalities. In my opinion, this book is dated and not particularly well written or engaging. I bought the book used and didn't hang onto it very long before getting rid of it."
3,Range much less than a wireless router,"This wireless extender installed easily. I put the antenna in the attic where there are 4 bars on my phone, and ran the cable to a lower level where there was one, and I now have 4 bars there as well. The only problem is I only get 4 bars 7-10 feet of the unit. I thought I would have phone service throughout my house, but the signal will not carry through a wall. I have to be near the extender pretty much in line of sight to get the signal strong."
1,Avoid if want any mobility with you cell phone,"I put the antenna on the very top of my roof with it verticle ran the cable to my computer room and my phone got all 5 bars in the computer room pretty much right next to the unit. Go about 10 feet and the signal goes back down to 1 to 2 to roaming, this is line of sight of the base unit. The manual states that it will cover 2500sq ft, there is no way it would or could cover that much area let alone 10ft. The manual states that the base unit is only a .25watt and talking to a communication buisness that sells similar units that are more high end and are up to 3watts those won't even cover that much area. If you want any mobility to roam around the house and get good signal don't waste your money on this, if you are stationary with your phone or tether it to your desktop then this would work for you. One thing postitve I can say the customer service was right on the phone with me and very friendly."
1,Does not work.,I received this product and installed as directed. It does not work at all. I get agreen power light but that is all. I called wi-ex tech support and they were lessthan helpful. One tech wanted me to buy the dual frequency. I don't know why if thesingle frequency does not work. I checked with Verizon before ordering and verifiedI am running on 1900mhz. Wi-Ex also verified the same. I need a signal booster butI want to look for something other than ZBoost. The manual plainly states Wi-Exguarantees the product but tech support said I had to deal with the retailer. Thishas not been a pleasant experience.
2,Less than adequate,Quite pricey for providing only a little better reception. At times it doesn't help at all. Range is much less than advertised. Must stay within 8 feet of the unit to benefit from it.
3,Signal Booster,Do not be fooled by the words SIGNAL BOOSTER. This product transfers a cell signal from the outside of a building to the inside. Do not expect miraclesI installed it at home. The signal strength on the roof of my house was at 4 bars but I had no reception inside the house. Now I get 3 to 4 bars in the livingroom where the unit is placed.This is what I expected and I am quite happy with the result
1,Weak Signal Issues,"Think carefully about higher frequency extenders if you have a weak signal. I had a weak signal and my service provider broadcasts at 1900 Mhz and 800 Mhz in my area. I assumed that the YX-500-PCS would work OK because the provider broadcasts at 1900 Mhz. Not so. The 1900 Mhz signal was not getting to my house because higher frequency signals are not as robust as low frequency signals. I exchanged the YX-500-PCS for the YX-500-CEL that operates in the 800 Mhz range, and the ""CEL"" version did an excellent job of solving my problem."
2,Not what I thought.,"It is two separate stories. I thought the two ladies interacted, but they don't. I was going to have some girls over to watch it but am thinking twice.... Just not as good as I was hoping. Glad I got it for a bargain price instead of the usual price."
2,Could not enjoy the movie.,"I been waiting to see this movie for a while but it seems that I'll have to wait even longer. I downloaded the movie to my computer and I go to watch it, the image is zoomed in and I can only see about 2/3 of the film. I can't see what's at the bottom nor at the top. Clear picture but not the whole scene."
3,"GOOD PERFORMANCES, BUT THE RECIPE IS A LITTLE OFF!","While there is no argument over Meryl Streep giving a wonderful performance as the first lady of TV cooking,this film seemed to be missing a few key ingredients. I was actually more interested in Amy Adam's character in many places and the story seemed a little lightweight considering what Julia Child did for the industry. It's a pleasant film certainly worthy watching, but it just didn't have the right recipe to satisfy my hunger for the subject matter."
4,Inspired me to cook,"Inspired me to learn how to be a better cook. It's funny, although sometimes the script is kind of cheesy."
4,Fun and motivating,"Original and creative script, running the lives of the two Js in parallel throughout the movie. Besides the mouth watering scenes of food preparation, through Julia we get a glimpse of life in Paris in the 1940s, and of how far McCarthyism went into the private lives of Americans. Throught Julie we see how a young and poor American, with a good idea, can make it. Make it big, in a way that would not be possible in Europe. As a writer I could appreciate the need for Julie to set herself a deadline, without which nothing ever gets completed.It's a fun movie, and an invitation to pursue what you love and not be afraid to put all your energy into it, even if you don't know where it might lead. If your heart is in it, it will lead somewhere. At least in America."
3,Very good movie,the item itself is perfectly good. i just wished i could have chosen my method of shipping and gotten it sooner.
3,Just ok,"Um, I guess if you have never heard of Julia until this movie came out then you probably will not like this movie. I am 25 and I took my mom out to see this at the theaters because she loved Julias cooking show. I thought the movie was long and drawn out. I left with a pounding headache. My mother on the other hand enjoyed it. Maybe its the age difference...Not sure, but I did not like this movie at all!"
4,Wonderful Movie By Nora Efron,"Practically every movie Nora Ephron has done is wonderful. She seems to be able to capture a true feeling of reality. This film parallels the lives of two people in such a seamlessly cleaver way that it is a joy to watch. It is an homage to the brilliant and innovative Julia Child (a hero to all serious home cooks) through the eyes of a modern young woman. A charming and uplifting movie, One of my all-time favorites. If you like to cook, admire Julia Child, or just want a good story, you will like this movie."
5,Julia Child Changed My Life,"Julia Child changed the way I cook and eat, but--more important--she changed the way Americans generally cook and eat. This film provided a delightful way to get to know her personal side, and Meryl Street did a terrific job of bringing her to life on the big screen."
4,Cute movie,"Cute movie but actually much more serious than I was expecting. Left me not loving Julia Child, which surprised me. But it's still fun to see and think, ""I might actually be able to cook some of her recipes."""
3,Cute- But Not Enough,"While I did enjoy this film, I felt that Julia Child's story was slighted. Her memoir in the book, ""My Life in France"" is far more fascinating and substantive and should have been made into its own film. I think that Meryl Streep does an excellent job as Julia and Stanley Tucci is perfect as Paul Child.It felt like Julia Child was being used to ""prop up"" the weaker story of Julie Powell. While the story of Julie Powell and her blog is cute and enjoyable, after she completes all of Julia's 540+ recipes, her story has nothing much left to say. By contrast, Julia Child's message is timeless and will continue to delight and inspire. In a competition for screen time, we are allowed to only skim the surface of Julia Child in this film- and her story is the one we should care about."
4,"Merryl Streep is ""The Best""","I was very pleased with ""Julie & Julia"" DVD. Meryll Streep is a wonderful actres and I am never disappointed in her movies.I have fond memories of watching Julia Child on TV. Streep certainly captured Julia Child's mannerisms and ""verve"" with her cooking skills,and sometimes making mistakes, and laughing them off. I really enjoyed this movie and am a loyal customer of Amazon.Carroll L. Heath"
2,Not specatcular.,"I'd heard great things about ""Julie and Julia"", but was left disappointed. While the movie was fun and cute, that's all it was. There was little characterization, and the treatment of Julia Child's love with her husband seemed unrealistic (they never fight?) and lacking in any depth. Julie and Eric's relationship seemed petty, both in its love without any apparent foundation (and no reason ever given for their move to an apartment that Julie hates from the start), and their petty fights over very little. I never got attached to them as characters, or to Julie's blogging and cooking project. Overall, highly underwhelming, and I'll be trading out my copy."
2,Mostly Charming,"I was always happier when Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci were on the screen. They were wonderful playing Mr and Ms Julia Child, but the modern couple not so much fun. And one wishes for more depth in the Julia C characterization. But a solid movie."
1,Dreadful & depressing.,"Had this been a movie simply about Julia Child, it could have been great. Instead, more than half of the movie is given over to the tedious narcissist Julie Powell, and the results are predictably horrifying. I know there really are people like this, but I don't need to pay money to watch movies lionizing them. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
5,Learned about Julia Child & Julie Adams - biography,"I learned about Julia Childs and hava a great wonder for her -- felt Julie did a great thing going through her cookbook in a year. I feel as if Julia was/is in the room. It is an awsome movie, an inspiration for any one. Meryl Streep did a wonderful job as Julia Childs, I believe one of her best roles by far!!"
1,A lot of boredom and bigotry,"First, let me say this movie had all the potential for being great - great actresses and a unique story (or rather stories). However, it went on and on and then on some more. Where was the editing???? Speaking of editing, they could have left out the digs on Republicans (hello.....at least 45% of the nation!!) and the fake Texas accents would be funny if not done surely in poor taste. I guess it's ok to be a bigot if the targeted group is either Southern in nature or Republican. Julie Powell and the entire writing team of this movie, you should be ashamed!!!!Kristine Alford, Texas"
1,Amazon needs to include negative star ratings,"I thought this was the worst movie I have ever seen, until I remembered one I believe was called Popeye, or something to that effect, I once watched in disbelief on an overseas flight. Yes, as others have written, the politics were annoying, and the suggestive parts, exacerbated by the relentless commentary, involving two older, unattractive actors were exceeding off-putting and certainly unnecessary. However, the continual narrative by some woman describing everything we were watching was beyond maddening - it was like being subjected to two hours of obnoxious TV ads - ads I would instantly mute. It is a crying shame these people wasted a wonderful opportunity to depict such a fascinating career in an educational and entertaining manner."
3,WAY TO LONG.... And could of done without Julie,The movie was way to long. It took my three days to watch it and because I kept falling asleep.Streeps performance once again was fantastic same with Stanly. Seemed like a couple head over heels for each other. I saw how the stories feed of each other. Just Julie's story as so boring it depressed me.Julie's husband ( Chris Messina) He's a talented actor and I hope one day I see him in the lead for all the chick flicks he's in.
1,pathetic regression,"Screeching Weasel is one of America's great punk bands, but here Ben Weasel just embarasses himself. There are some good songs, but not many, and it's the puerile, moronic songs like Erection and I Just Wanna F*** that ruin this album. How can the same guy who wrote thoughtful, intelligent songs like A New Tomorrow and Celena commit this junk to record? It's not that I'm offended by vulgarity, but these songs just come off as the work of the same frat-boy mentality that Weasel has always transcended. Even when the material avoids this stupidity, it sounds tired and worn, like Ben is just going through the motions. Stick with classics like Anthem For a New Tomorrow or Emo, and avoid this at all costs. It is not representative of a band capable of much, much better."
2,Lacks Staying Power,"This probably deserves 2 and-a-half, maybe three stars. Maybe. The whole thing sounds to me like ""Well, we've(I've)got these songs, they're rehearsed, we have a label, let's record them"". That's about it, no real emotional attachment to or involvement with the material. I'm a long time Weasel fan too, but these songs just don't stay with me. Television City Dream is more memorable, and that's saying something. This one sounds a little fatter though, but that's cold comfort. I can't honestly say I wouldn't have put this record out though, there are no Ghandis or Albert Schweitzers in the music industry, Fugazi included, and everybody takes a dive now and again."
2,"Worst Screeching Weasel Yet, Ben Should BE ASHAMED","Oh man, my favorite punk band (besides the Ramones) has disappointed me yet again. Thanks Mr. Foster.Man, this album is not really not worth buying if you consider yourself a hardcore Weasel fan. It's just a shell of their previous albums.There is no feeling in the vocals or the beats, man it is a shame.(And Ben Weasel/Foster's solo album is not any better.)Everything after HOW TO MAKE ENEMIES, in my opinion, has just gotten worse and worse.But even though they broke up [yes, again (it's been like 4 or 5 times now)]. Their website says that they are working on a new album. Hopefully it will be better than this one."
2,just curious on something,Hi I just purchased this product- just received it today- i read on the ingredients- it listed high fructose corn syrup- but when i purchased it- it said made with cane sugar???????????? so which is it?
5,still playing with this 2 years later and we're not done yet,This doll car seat is super cute and the perfect size for most standard baby dolls. Two years later it is still holding up nicely and goes on many road trips with us.
5,great buy,i'm about to order a second set. works great for every day use and perfect for dinner parties. great in the dishwasher as well
5,Better than expected,"We purchased 5 cases of these glasses for our wedding. It was cheaper than renting. They are sturdy, practical, and appealing to the eye. They were multifunctional... used for wine, margaritas, cokes, iced tea, lemonade, and water. Perfect for our casual outdoor wedding!"
2,interesting idea but it doesnt work,"Herbst claims to be making a generalizable argument about the implications of political geography (which for him seems to consist solely of population density) on state building. That is, low population densities are problematic for state officials trying to broadcast their authority throughout the territory they supposedly control. Whether or not his theory holds for African states is debatable given the shoddy evidence presented. Even more questionable, though, is whether this theory has any value for understanding state building in the non-African world - lots of countries with low population densities (like canada or australia, for example) dont face nearly the same problems as African states do with regard to authority broadcasting and state formation. overall, this book is an interesting and perhaps innovative take on political development, but it ultimately fails to make a persuasive case for bringing political geography to center stage."
2,Not a true Blue Man Performance,"I just saw the Blue Man Group in Vegas last week and was blown away! This DVD just blows - perhaps that's a bit harsh.I bought the DVD knowing it would be somewhat different as shows vary from city to city, year to year. However, I had no idea that they would abandon what makes Blue Men so great. It's as if the producers of the DVD didn't have faith that the Blue Men could carry a DVD performance.I was stunned when I saw the band at center stage and heard vocals. Instead of a true Blue Man performance we got a rock concert by some seemingly anonymous group with the Blue Man bits sprinkled throughout. There was no singing at the Blue Man show in Vegas. Only a computer generated narrator to supplement the performance art.Short of it: this is not a true Blue Man Group performance. However, I hope they produce one someday so I can share it with friends."
2,Blue Man Group - The Complex Rock Tour Live is a much better concert.,"The ""Blue Man Group - The Complex Rock Tour Live"" on DVD is a much better concert than ""Blue Man Group: How to Be a Megastar Live!""a good example of this is the song I Feel Love in this DVD it is sung by Adrian Hartley and it doesn't even come close to the performance of Venus Hum/Annet Strean singing I feel Love in the ""Blue Man Group - The Complex Rock Tour Live""."
4,Fun...worth the money!,"We've seen the Blue Man Group shows in Vegas, both when the were at Luxor and now that they're at the Venetian. When we saw this Blu-Ray at Amazon for less than $12, we couldn't resist. It's fun to watch and definitely worth the money. Of course it can't beat seeing BMG live, but hey, it's a lot cheaper this way!"
5,Profound,"This is my first review on Amazon. I've had this CD for years, and have always been a ""Canon in D"" fan. This particular album has such a special place in my heart I wanted to share. It's rare that so much emotion is captured by any music, but there are several tracks on this CD that do. The Canon's Whisper instantly gripped me the first time I heard it, and it remains my favorite. It's not just my favorite on this album, but one of my 2 most favorite songs in any genre of all time. To be honest, this album is also associated with a very fond time in my life which may affect my opinion, though I truly believe I would love it just as much if I heard it today for the first time. I don't listen to classical too often, but this one has kept me coming back for years. I can't recommend it enough."
5,Exploration and Conquest: The Americas After Columbus,"Outstanding description of explorers to the new world after Columbus. Puts the voyages and their countries motives into perspective with clear and concise chrolological account. Highly recommended for the 4th grade explorers unit, and from the 3rd grade through the 7th grade. An excellent historical book and contains good color illustrations. I would recommend it to students from the 3rd grade through the 7th grade, and wish to include a recommendation for teachers, as well."
5,absolutely spectacular!,"I've always loved Hank Shermann for his work with King Diamond in Mercyful Fate as I love Andy La Roque, the guitarist in King Diamond's solo band, and I think they're two of the most underrated guitarists around. So, whenever they put out solo projects of their own, I jump on them. Virus 7 is even better than the Gutrix album, Hank's last solo project. I love this cd, I play it everyday, it's great to drive to at night as well. It's very well produced, and I believe these guys were just trying to pull of a fun, hard-driving metal album...Mission accomplished! I give it 5 stars and highly recommend it."
2,Short lived,"I typically buy ceramic heat elements, but do enjoy the night view of my tanks that these bulbs provide. After trying these bulbs again, however, I will unfortunately have to switch back to ceramic, as these last a fraction of the time that ceramics do, especially if you are a user that will use the lamp 24 hours a day.My recommendation is to use ceramic bulbs for any heat needs."
2,"If your pet depends on it, be sure to have a spare...","These lamps put out a nice amount of heat, however, I have encountered inconsistent bulb life with Exo Terra. I purchased two of these 100W bulbs to use in a chicken brooder. I'm glad I chose a redundant set-up instead of the usual (one 250W bulb) because after just one week, one of the bulbs failed. The second lamp allowed my chicks to survive until I could find a replacement (this lamp is still going after 6 weeks of being on 24/7, which is about 1000 hrs). I would not buy these lamps again."
2,"Very small, like kids glasses","Wow, really really small, I could not even think of wearing them, I gave them to my girlfriend, but probably should have given them to her grandkid."
3,Great glasses at a great price**,"I've only had them a couple of weeks so I don't know anything about how durable they are yet, but they fit great, cut the glare, and were at a great price.**Updated: 8/1/12 I had them for 7 months and they got a stress fracture in the frame. I'm going to try to contact the company b/c I've been very careful and easy on them."
1,KID SIZE....NOT MAN SIZE,"If you look for a normal size - pair of sunglasses - you have to buy ones which have a clear specification regarding the dimension (small,medium,large..etc). This Flying Fisherman is only a ""toy"" ... I gave it to my grandchildren which is only four year old (also for him are small???!!!)....Do not throw your money away."
5,Real Quality Fishing Glasses!,"I think that these glasses are incredible. I read alot of the reviews before I bought these glasses, and I didn't know whether or not it was going to be worth my money but after using these on a hot summer day on the pier I couldn't be happier. Usually I will spend a good 3-4 hours on the water and I would pay for it that night, with red inflamed eyes, finally I decided that I really needed protection. In fact I may have waited too long because my vision after a few months with no glasses and a lot of time on the water went from a perfect 20/20 to 20/25, meaning that what normal people can see at 25 ft I have to be 5 feet closer to whatever the thing is they're looking at. Anyways this is a great product and defiantly great for the price. Couldn't be happier. Real quality durable plastic as well."
5,No More Back Pain!,"I got my DVD set directly from Dr. Grogin and it worked wonders! I suffered from lower back pain for years, but no more. Exercises are easy to learn and simple to do."
5,There's Just Something about this Book!!!!,"I am now purchasing my third copy of this book because both of my sons, infant and toddler, absolutely adore it and have worn them out with time. There's just something about the illustrations and interactive tabs that keep them reaching for it again and again. My husband and I enjoy adlibbing through the ridiculously charming pictoral storyline. BOTH boys were impelled on their own to give Carl a kiss on the last page -- too precious. Good Dog, Carl!!!"
4,Man - 'The 1999 Party Tour' (Eagle/Point),"Cannot believe that I actually let this disc sit around the house for awhile before getting around to listening to it.First off,it's WAY better than that 'Greasy Trucker' 2-track EP.The band hails from Wales,UK.Not wanting to be out done by just any band from that era,guitarist/vocalist Deke Leonard and crew plays a sort of 'progressive psychedelia' that you simply just don't see anymore.This five-track winner was recorded in April 1974 in Chicago when they toured as support act for Hawkwind.I,personally know several people that still speak of that tour from time to time.Best tracks were easy to spot,like ""71 71 551""(which is said to have been Mike Nesmith's phone number at THAT time) and the superbly done 25-minute epic ""C'mon"".Anyone who owns a copy of this CD can be sure to get many enjoyable plays within years to come.Should appeal to fans of Wishbone Ash,Quicksilver Messenger Service and Caravan."
4,Hopefully it will work when needed,Haven't tried it yet since I purchased it for an emergency. But it seems good. I will let everyone know once I actually use it.
3,Good but...just in the dark,"I measured it at 500 feet in the dark. It is clearly visable. But headlights will wash it out as some point as a car approaches it. And if there are lights beyond your vehicle it may get lost. However, it is inexpensive and certainly better than leaving your emergency blinkers on if you are going to be away for long enough for them to drain your battery. I wouldn't buy just one per vehicle. I'd buy several. The magnetic feature is very handy. But the key is getting your vehicle off the road as far as possible so emergency lighting is not as important. If you can't I'd use emegegency flashers and get back to your vehicle ASAP. And forget about using this during the day. You can't see it from far enough away to avoid an accident."
4,Good Product,"I picked up this Heininger 1020 Flameless Flare to keep in my car's trunk in case of emergency. I was hoping to never have to use it. Unfortunately a few nights ago, I got into a bit of a fender bender. It was fairly dark out when it happened on a road with not great visibility. So I popped this little flare out, turned it on, and placed it on the ground behind my car.The flare seemed quite bright enough. And passing drivers obviously noticed it as I didn't get run over while standing by my car.Very good product. And reuseable."
3,"won't replace real flare, but might be handy","Thank goodness I haven't had an emergency to use this yet, but it's in my glove compartment just in case. I checked it out when I received the flare, and it seems pretty bright. I'm not sure how well this would work on a busy urban freeway, but I live in a very rural mountainous area with lots of one lane roads, so I think it could be very helpful if I break down."
3,"Better thanb nothing, not for daylight usage","I was expecting more from this product, but perhaps I was hoping for too much. The LED is bright for night or twilight usage, and has a solid or blinking setup, but this is not a day flare. Keep a traditional flare for daytime emergencies.I do like the light and especially the innovation, but I'll add it to my kit and not just rely on it alone."
2,Not really useful,The topics are discussed in a too generic way to let the reader take advantage of the book.
3,Not the first choice for those new to Adams,"An interesting take, but not as readable as others. Somehow the words don't ""flow"" as, say, with McCullough."
2,Not very helpful,Much of book contains common sense topics that most readers would know on their own. Other books have been much more helpful in the licensing arena than I found with this one. Writer has a great deal of references to his web site to steer readers for licensing help. However he does not mention he charges a hefty fee to conduct such reviews. Book did not contain much guidance in area of options for selling your idea as other books on that topic have offered.
2,NO GOOD WITHOUT EVERYONE TOGETHER,"YOU KNOW, I AM SURE THAT MR. DOHERTY HAD HIS HEART IN THE RIGHT PLACE WHEN HE DID THIS ALBUM, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WITHOUT THE ORIGINAL M&P PLAYERS, THEIR SONGS JUST ARE NOT THE SAME. THE M&P SONGS WERE WRITTEN/RECORDED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE GROUP'S FOUR UNIQUE VOICES, AND WITHOUT ALL OF THEM TOGETHER, IN MY OPINION, THE SONGS JUST FALL FLAT. MR. DOHERTY MAY BE TRYING TO KEEP THE SPIRIT OF THE M&P'S ALIVE, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, THIS CD PROVES THAT, WHILE HE STILL MAY BE ABLE TO SING THE SONGS, THERE IS JUST THAT CERTAIN *SOMETHING* THAT IS NO LONGER THERE."
4,awesome magnet,if u like futurama or robots or both this is a cool magnet for the fridge.. I really dig the stylish art they use for a lot of these
5,its a cable,"worth paying a little extra than the cheap ones at the local box store, will buy again. solid performer. used on various eqipment and does the job, hope to get more soon."
4,A must for Motorheadbangers,"I purchased this DVD at a national chain store in 2008 for nostalgic reasons. It didn't disappoint (except for the sound glitch during ""Killed by Death""; I returned it but the new DVD had the exact same glitch so it's likely in the entire pressing). The energy is great and the execution flawless. If you are a Motorhead fan, you will enjoy this!"
2,Disappointed,"I've been unable to assemble this table due to missing parts which should have been installed by manufacturer. After thorough inventory of all parts per the assembly instructions, all pieces were included; however, the threaded holes for cam-bolts were missing in Side Panel A. The threaded holes were installed in Side Panel B but there were no threaded holes to tighten the cam-bolts into Side Panel B. Assembly stopped early in Step 3."
1,HORRIBLE QUALITY,"This item is awful. It was missing 12 dowels, so I went to the local hardware store and bought those, rather than wait for the company to ship them. The bottom will not fully screw in. It wiggles from side to side. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. FIND SOMETHING BETTER."
3,"Mediocre table, great service.","The table is now serviceable, but I had to contact the seller for missing connecting dowels. I attempted to call the manufacturer using the 800 number on the assembly instructions but had my call answered by a machine instructing me to call another number which charged big bucks for calling it. What a scam!!! I then contacted the seller using the number for them listed on Amazon, advised them of the scam and requested the parts be sent. I don't know if they knew about the scam but I received the parts promptly. The table is okay but it's the usual particle board with a veneer. My rating: Table=okay Seller Service=very good"
1,Piece of Junk,"Please save your money and do not purchase this item. Instructions are impossible to comprehend, you have to visually problem solve the assembly. The method to firm the assembly pieces are flawed and result in a ""wobbly"" piece of furniture. In this case, you get what you pay for.Spend a few hundred dollars more and get a piece of furniture!"
2,Bad.....bad .......bad piece of furniture,I would have returned the table but had already tried to put together and placed delivery box in trash which is where the table actually belongs. The locking mechanisms that came with the table to not tighten properly due to poor workmanship of the brackets.The table has come apart mutiple times spilling things when cleaning around it.Would not recommend this piece to anyone.
5,Excellent!,"I'd like to have this cap sent to me every 8-mo's, but this delivery option is not offered, yet... ;-)"
3,Good and Bad,"I didn't know what to expect when I got this CD, but some of it isn't bad and some of it is. I loved Unchained, Dance the Night Away and Atomic Punk. I liked Light up the Sky except that it sounded like Yngwie Malmsteen was trying to sqeeze every lick known to man into one solo, but the overall sound was good. The rest of the tracks were pretty good for the most part except for Running with the Devil, So This is Love and Little Guitars. Jake E. Lee's guitar work and solo in particular aren't very good on Running with the Devil. The solo is nothing even slightly resembling the original. I also didn't care much for the guitar work and tone in So This is Love either, but everything else sounded okay. And lastly, Little Guitars sounds like it was recorded in a home studio for $200 in someone's basement, although the arrangement and musicianship were good. These are just my opinions though so check it out for yourself."
2,Little Guitars = Little Value For Your Money,"...I also bought this album because I like Van Halen and like a previously hadbought another tribute album that had been produced by Bruce Kulick, which wasREALLY good (Bat Head Soup - Ozzy Tribute if anyone is interested). ApparentlyBruce was asleep at the board when this was recorded. It's terrible! If you likeVan Halen, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM! It is an insult to good music."
4,"Interesting, if vague","I loved the imagery and strength here, but the symbolism is a bit off. Not recommended as a first deck, although useful for meditation/further study."
5,Excellent laptop backpack for those needing more space than your usual business traveler,"This backpack is fantastic for a traveling engineer. It is probably a little big for the average business person but is perfect for anyone technical who also needs an array of cables, connectors, chargers, plus a digital camera, PSP, noise-canceling headphones.. you name it. I love all the various pockets this pack has and how much padding surrounds your laptop. Makes it easy to, essentially, just throw your laptop back in while in a rush (airport, client site, etc.)."
5,"Nice, Big, Hopefully Well-Made Backpack For Your 17"" MBP","This thing holds an awful lot of stuff. The laptop slot BARELY holds the 17"" MacBook Pro. Shockingly, with Speck's polycarbonate case in place, the 17"" MBP still fits!"
5,a book to read,this book has so many emotions. i have read this book so many times but it does not bore me. this book will give you some light on a girls life after she has no one to look after her expect her fathers friend . this is book u should read.
5,My 17 year old son loves it!,I purchased this movie for my 17 year old boy who is really in to mountain biking. He loved it and has watched it many times over. Great buy. Thanks Amazon.
4,Broadway version,"Pocket Songs released this disc after Frank Wildhorn changed the musical after concept when it went to Broadway.This version is based on the Broadway run. Some of the music was not changed at all, but ""Where's the Girl"" is vastly more powerful on this version.Orchestration is good, some songs are duplicates from the concept album, but it's still worth the purchase."
1,This book is a knock-off,"When I skimmed through the book and found the authors had the wrong day, month, and year of Dean Martin's death, I knew it was return time."
4,My thoughts!,I thought this book was very appropriate. It shows how kids do not understand everything and need to learn more about the history of our country. Daniel Lofton was very informed. He had an intelligent reason for not standing to the Pledge of Allegiance. The very mature thing about Daniel Lofton was he never made anyone do what he did. He felt if they had a reason to sit than more power to them but he would never force someone to believe what he did. I wish I could have done this as a teenager in high school and even hope to be able to do that when i become an adult. I hope that i will be able to voice my opinion and not care what other people think of me. I enjoyed this book very much and recommend that kids arounf the age of 15 read this book and think about what Daniel is doing and try to change.
3,Allegiance is repetitive,"I found the book to be okay. The book gets into different political views on the Pledge of Allegiance. Allegiance shows freedom of speech and choice. The book helped me see different views through different people. Although, the book was good at showing different political views, I thought the book was very repetitive. You will find Daniel doing the about the same thing everyday. The only difference is its a different day. The book tended to make me yawn. You may like this book if you like to read books that are repetitive."
1,Oh boy....,"Can I rate this a negative number? I'm a huge Kansas fan, and Kerry Livgren solo fan, and have always believed he was the main force behind Kansas. After listening to this pile of crap, I believe it more than ever. Painfully stupid lyrics. Ridiculous use of keyboard effects while trying to sound like Trent Reznor from Nine-Inch-Nails. It's amazing that such a great keyboardist, and vocalist, can make such terrible use of his skills. He obviously can't write songs, because there's only about 2 real songs on this record. The rest are a waste of CD space. I had to start scanning the songs, because I was on the verge of puking. This will go on auction on Ebay starting at a penny, and it's not worth that in my opinion.If you want great solo Kansas stuff, stick with Kerry Livgren. Everything he's done is amazing."
4,Steve Walsh ROCKS!,"If you are a fan of the work Steve Walsh has done with Kansas, you'll like this CD. If your a fan of the work Steve Walsh did with Streets..You'll LOVE this CD.This new release from the lead voice of Kansas ROCKS from note one. This CD is a spectacular showcase for Steve Walsh's style of agressive hard hitting rock and roll ..with good lyrics. I know Steve is pushing 50 now but let me tell you he hasn't lost his Rock and Roll Soul. I really like 'Smackin the clowns"" and ""serious Wreckage'has a lot to say...so give it a listen. But start out with the volume a little low...because this cd may just blow you right out of the room."
2,I'm Sure Steve Walsh Could Do Better Than This,"I'm sitting here scatching my head as I listen to the total noise. Is Steve Walsh trying to imitate Metallica or AC/DC or whoever? At one point I thought he was Justin Timberlake wannabe. This is a total waste of time. If you like heavy metal, then this is for you. If you're expecting anything like his Schemer Dreamer or something along the lines of Kansas, forget it. You'll be very disappointed in this CD. This is one of the worst CDs I've ever bought and not something I'd download to my iPod. Don't waste your time or money on this. In my opinion, it's total garbage."
3,"figures are bad, but everything is also online!","This book was a quick read, rather short. About half of the book goes over actual programming concepts, and the other half goes over a long design example scenario. The book is written in a fun engaging way, but in my mind the book costs a little too much for such a short read.Coming in, I was an intermediate Labview user, and the book has opened my eyes to some better ways to program.For those of you complaining about the quality of the figures, visit the website at authors.phptr.com/watts. Note that there is a typo in the URL on the back cover!"
3,"great content, bad printing quality","The content is very helpfull for the design of professional application. The software design approach kills finally the idea that Labview is just a nice and funny toy ! This request a rigorus approach to the programming as in all the others languages and allow to produce efficient and reusable code.Unfortunately the printing quality is very bad, the figures are unreadable and you need the source code to understand something.It is really a pitty !"
1,"missing letter ""G""","This book is beautiful and inventive as everyone says, but ours is missing the letter ""g."" How does that happen? The facing pages have earthworms entertaining fireflies as they fandango, then on to hummingbirds hiding inside irises. Where's the g? If we got a bad book, how does that work? All of the other letters are there. It seems like there'd be another missing letter to balance things out. Nope. Just ""g."""
5,Great,This product came on time and was what I needed. It fit prefect and I am very happy with my choose.
1,Metra 99-2003 dash kit,"Bought for my 04 silverado Doesn't fit very well, instruction manual sucks and is no help. Don't know what car this fits in but it didnt fit my 04 silverado 1500"
2,VERY UNSATISFIED,"I received this product in unsat.condition. The box appeared to be ""bent and chewed up"". The flatware looked cheap and even discolored.It was all out in the box. This was ordered for a christmas gift. I did not give it, instead I went out and bought more."
1,Very Disappointed!!!,Do not purchase this item expecting much from it. The spoons in this set are practically flat and they look fake.
4,Door Opens Review,"Jeff Kashiwa has taken a step toward becoming a very good, young saxaphonist with his latest recording, ""Another Door Opens"". This CD is not wide ranging but demeonstrates Jeff's abilities and why he was thought so highly when with the Rippingtons. I strongly recommend those who enjoy the soprano saxaphone to purchase this CD."
5,great,product shipped fast and was a great product actually better than expected would recommend it to anyone was happy with what i got
5,Love this bouncer!!!,"Sturdy & Stylish. This bouncer does not have a vibration feature but is oversized and can fit a larger baby. Also, it is more of a rocker than a bouncer but does bounce slightly. It is easy to clean since the cover is removable and the fabric is very plush. Both the back and the footrest are adjustable to the point where you can either create a little rocking chair once the baby is older or lay flat for sleeping. I love the carrying handles. The toys on the toybar are removable and you can hang your own toys. Overall this is an awesome bouncer that is more sturdy than the average bouncer on the market."
4,Giant pills that smell nasty but have made the cold and flu season better for me,These definately have a nasty smell when you open the bottle and are giant (probably double the size of my multi-vit) but I have watched my son and fiance get sick multiple times this winter and they haven't passed it onto me like it usually happens. So I defintaley think it has boosted my immune power which is why I got them. Worth adding too your herbal regimen especially during cold and flu season
3,Was expecting more,good material but was expecting a different lay out in the book was very impressed with the Q and A throughout the whole book
1,"Initial excitement, then disappointment","Initially, I was very excited when I received this watch since it had the new NH35a hackable movement. My excitement quickly turned to disappointment when I tried to set the date, the crown pulled completely out of the watch. I own other automatic watches, I know not to exert unnecessary pull when extending the crown. Returned the watch and ordered a 9937OB with a swiss movement. Hopefully I will have better luck with the (slightly) more expensive watch. I will post a review on the 9937OB when I get it."
1,Broken after one year,"This is a great looking watch, but really cheap. I just used it on regular basis and the main brand pin was detached. Really a pitty. Warranty was over, so I just tryed to fix it in a local store. It didn't work. Really not well done.Go for a better quality. I do not recommend this one."
5,EXCELLENT FOR THE PRICE,"I recently bought this watch for well under $100 dollars. All I can say is for the money, this is an excellent watch. It also came with a 5 year warranty, which is nice just in case, but even if it didnt have a warranty, at this price who cares!It looks great on, and much more expensive than it actually is. The time keeping so far is excellent, ive had it for week and it is a minute fast.If you are new to automatic watches, buy this watch."
4,Hard to believe....,"I have had this one for a couple of months - looks better in person and keeps time fine. Frankly, it is hard to fathom this watch being less than $100....I have paid 5 times that for frankly a poorly built watch what started falling to pieces after a year...Not sure what is stopping you from buying one, but for the price, just get it..."
5,GREAT WATCH,YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE OF AN INVICTA AUTOMATIC DIVER WATCH THAT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE A ROLEX SUBMARINER. THIS WATCH IS WELL MADE AND HAS A LOT OF CLASS. THIS IS MY SECOND INVICTA AND I WOULD BUY ANOTHER IF SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO THIS ONE.
4,My favorite watch,"The watch stops ticking after about 6 - 8 hours after no movement. The bezel gets harder and harder to rotate every day. I once had to use pliers to turn the bezel back to the original position. But other than that, it's a great watch"
5,Top Quality Watch,"Opened the box and it looked so much better in person, I was debating between getting the coin edge 8926ob 42mm or the smaller 37mm 8926a because of my small 6.5 inch wrist, but i decided i would go with classy rolex style coin edge and i couldnt be happier, its the perfect size watch for a man and it screams class. The movement on this watch is great as well, it has the hacking second hand so it can be timed easily and its very accurate only a few seconds off a day, the bezle has a nice quality weight to it, and it feels solid between each click, all in all im extreamly happy with my purchase and have no real cons on it."
4,"Very happy. So far, so good...","Just got this a few days ago. Pleased to see it has the 24 jewel Seiko NH35A movement which is hackable. Beautiful watch, nice weight, sturdy. Used my little watch repair kit (also purchased on Amazon for 8 bucks) to remove some bracelet links myself (saved 15 bucks there!). I had done a lot of research before pulling the trigger on this one. I continue to look for blogs and post since I have read quite a few reports of ""lemons"" of this watch (Invicta QC issues?). But like I said, so far, so good. Also got the Diplomat single watch winder to keep it in while i'm not wearing it. So far, quite accurate. Love the look and especially the sweeping second hand. Happy with my purchase. Only reason for 4 stars vs. 5 stars is that I've only had it a week or so and for me it's still on a 30 day ""probation."" I recommend this watch. For $85, you can't beat it!"
3,Invicta Mens Pro Diver 8926C,"The first watch I received was faulty, it kept stopping, usually with the second hand on the 8.I contacted amazon to return it and get a replacement, I thought it would be worth one more go at 60. Amazon almost immediately sent me another watch(before I sent the bad one back), the new one has been good so far(2 weeks later).Very pleased with the watch for the price, and extremely pleased with the service from Amazon.The watch seems to be pretty much bang on for time accuracy, I was expecting it to gain or lose time like a lot of automatics but it seems to be OK at the moment.It is running 15 seconds fast but that's because it doesn't have a hacking feature to properly set the watch which is a shame but you can't beat it at the price."
2,Looks Great doesn't work well,"I have had an Invicta 8926 for a couple years now. The watch looks great, a nice heavy weight stainless divers watch. Mine however has been problematic, First off even when wearing it all day it would frequently stop working completely. I sent it back for warranty repairs (took two months) and upon return it would not keep time. It would loose about twenty minutes per day. Back to the factory and another couple months later I received a new watch. Guess what, it doesn't do much better. It looses about about 15 minutes a day and also stops working occasionally. I have bought a Seiko Automatic Divers watch to takes the Invictas place and it works great. If Invicta would make this watch actually work properly it would be a great watch."
3,Nice watch for the money,"Very attractive watch - surprises are the weight (quite heavy) and the ""automatic movement"" feature - you MUST wear it every day - and even then, it occasionally has stopped (taken it off at night to sleep)."
5,Superb Value,"This is my first automatic movement watch, and after a week I can say I could not be more pleased. I can not find a better watch under $200, especially with these looks. It has a heavy feel and a nice finish. Exceeded my expectations! A+"
5,What can I say I like it!,"This watch is a steal for 85 bucks!NH35 hack and handwind Seiko movement. Could be worn for a formal or informal occasion.If you are questioning a purchase because it is an Invicta don't, just buy it I am glad I did."
2,Crown and stem pulled out after two days,I was really looking forward to this watch too. The crown and stem pulled out after only two days. I did return it to Amazon and their return policy is flawless. I exchanged the 8926OB for a titanium Invicata model 0420. It came today and so far the crown and stem is intact. The 0420 is much lighter and quite a bit larger than the 8926OB.I'm pretty hard on watches and have read here that the 0420's band is scratch prone. That is not a deal killer for me as my 7 year old Bulova automatic is scratched and dinged.
4,Very Nice Watch,"I love this watch. I got it for my boyfriend about a year ago, and he absolutely loves it. It is a fancy watch, but is casual and nice enough for everyday wear. He collects watches so this is a great addition to his collection. The face is quite elegant and very shiny and in pristine condition. I highly recommend this watch."
1,Not recommended for Canon PowerShot S5 IS,"If there was a zero star, I would have rate this product minus zero. The impression given was that this product works well with the canon powershot series cameras. Lie! Lie! Lie!Poor performance with Canon PowerShot S5 IS! Hence, not recommended."
3,Left an odd residue,"I've always liked Rusk products but this one does very odd things to my fine hair. After rinsing and drying my hair it felt soapy in places. Thinking I just didn't rinse enough, I tried again, combing out my shoulder length hair in cool water for at least 5 minutes. It felt clean - until it dried! Then I still had the feeling of soapy hair. Maybe it's just an interaction with my hair (that's the reason for a 3 star rating and not a 1 star rating). If you try it I do hope you have better luck!"
2,Wasted Inheritance,"This is the memoir of two brothers who gamble away their inheritance at Gulf Coast casinos. Their descent into addiction is both unfortunate and pathetic. Their lives unraveld with the roll of a dice. Often repititious, sometimes sluggish, and certainly not the kind of flowing prose one would expect from two men now employed as college writing instructors."
3,A Satisfying Sequel,"As history shows, most sequels are often a rehash of the previous work, films - books - etc. But Ms. Warren had established so much history in the original book, The Front Runner, that this sequel works on many levels. I was only a little disappointed by a secondary plot involving a man from Harlan's past as boy who has a hideous back story to him. In some ways, it hurt my memory of the original novel a bit, and gave this book a ""Hollywood"" type story line that I didn't really appreciate. The story is wonderful, and its nice to revist these characters again. This is truly a book for the people who loved the original so much that you need to know what happens next."
1,Too many errors,"I realy hate this book. A lot of errors, no word about Linux. I will never bye any other ""Norton"" book. I also tried to get some answers from the author but the silence was the answer. There are so many good book around! Buy someone else."
3,Well plotted but slow,"Kellerman's books don't move with the speed and urgency of say a John Sandford ""Prey"" novel. These are slow, carefully plotted stories where the police theorize, interview and in general plod their way to a conclusion. Alex Delaware serves as a somewhat whitewashed version of a profiler. Milo Sturgis is a course, rough, genius of a cop. It's always interesting to see Kellerman reveal the motives bit by bit. He feeds the reader information in disjointed pieces and manages to throw in a few red herrings.One little thing about the author that annoys me is the way he describes his characters. Alex Delaware is, of course nearly perfect in appearance and manner. But Alex is supper critical of everyone else he encounters. He notices that Milo has food on his chin and spots on his ties. He focuses on sweat, drool and shinny bald spots, pimples and bad teeth. Odd that he doesn't become too graphic with the blood and gore but dwells on physical inperfection"
1,Really Bad,"My 2nd book by Kellerman and I can't remember the plot of the first, thankfully. This one does it for me. I thought it was terrible and don't understand how someone could get away with what the perp did for so many years. Wake up people.I agree with many others, the ending needed finishing. What happened? Where did everyone go?Skip this one in my opinion."
2,Boring,"I have always enjoyed Jonahan Kellerman's books. What made this one different--and tedious to read--is the absence of any characters that one could care about--they're all dreadful people whose fate would normally be in the back pages of the Sunday paper, and the protagonists are in a disengaged, wandering intellectual mode. I was really sorry I spent money to be so thoroughly bored. A difficult book to finish without falling asleep."
3,Decent thriller,"I am new to this author, I've read three so far, obviously out of sequence. I did go back and find the first one, I'd recommend that one first, although he does a good job of seamless back story, why not just start at the beginning?Anyway, if you like popular mystery authors, Patterson, Grafton, etc., you'll probably enjoy this author as well. He does a good job of developing characters, for the most part, and the action moves pretty well."
3,Kellerman in general,"I actually enjoy Jonathan Kellerman's novels and think I have read most of them. But some things irk me.Alex Delaware always seems preoccupied by detailed memories of past and present girlfriends. You don't need to be a psychologist to do that.Sometimes his soliliqies about psychology seem endless, page after page. Too wordy. And psychology is at best a vague science. His use of the word borderline makes more sense than most.The plots are good but usually include so many characters that you have to read the book two or three times to remember who's who. And he regurgitates his prior novel contents ad nauseam.I think he has improved over time, mostly because the cop Milo Sturgis takes more of a leading role.I think this review includes all his books, but still I like them, and I'll buy the next one too, so I guess I'm a fan.A word of warning. His wife's novels are dreadful."
3,Psychological thriller!,If you are looking for a good rainy day read this is it! Kellerman has been entertaining the masses with his Alex Delaware the psychologist/sleuth for many years. These stories do a nice job of showing the insight that psychological science has into the minds of criminals and their victims. They also maintain a high level of suspense. Kellermans writing is adequate to the job and his characters are lively and interesting.
1,More Terrorist poo-pooing,"The book is a completely waste of time and money. More arab propaganda claiming that killing people is all right, and the ""opression"" of palestinians with levi's on and mobile devices next to their ears. I think I will try to write one like this to explain my own opression with my bank, just in case I decide walking in and putting a gun in front of the desk. The most bizarre thing of all is that this ""solidarity movement"" claims that ""solidarity"" means killing jews, blowing themselves up in cafes and trading with weapons. More rubbish to amazon."
1,Good at first then completely sucks,"I bought this camera about 2 years ago, and at first it worked great; the pictures turned out excellent and the quality was perfect. Then once the battery that came with the camera went out I started just replacing it with regular AA batteries and they would be dead by the time I tried using the camera the second time. Then the pictures started to come out fuzzy and I started to get angry with the camera. I guess the old saying you get what you pay for totally goes with this camera. So I would not recomment this camera because it only lasts for a little bit and then it sucks."
1,Tried to like it,"Had it for 33 days. Wife wanted Nikon. Talked her into Kodak DX4900. It was simple, especially with the docking station. It was easy to transport - small and light.Problems:1) 2X zoom is not sufficient2) 3X digital zoom is unusable unless you mount on tripod or stationaly object. What's the use of having a camera if you cannot use the zoom.3) Rechargable batter would lose 1/2 it's life after several days of non-use.4) Cannot tell you how many times I tried to turn camera one and could not figure out why it was not operational.5) Last straw was when I lost 70 pictures with 256MB Flash card at 2MP level. Things were great until I turned camera off. When I turned it back on, it said ""need to format"". I had used the flash card for hundreds of pictures.I ended up taking camera back."
1,Not worth the money!,"I was very disappointed at the book overall. I bought the book based upon the raving user reviews, but found them to be totally untrue. It keeps on going back and forth between similar subjects. It's very repetitive and didn't give me what I was hoping to learn from reading this book.I honestly wouldn't recommend it to anyone, not even to beginners because it will probably confuse you more than enlighten you."
4,A can't miss purchase!,"One of the best live recordings I've heard in a long time. I attended some of the Farm Aid concerts where these songs were performed, and the CD really captures the energy and spirit of these events. A great CD for a great cause!"
3,Yes and no...,"The 23"" Wega, also from Sony, is a sharper and not much smaller set than the 26"" Bravia (sorry Sony). I have no use for the latter."
5,A big hit!,"This guest book was a gift and the receiver loved it. It has a cute cover and lots of pages for visitors to make comments after their visits. There are prompts to enable you to make appropriate remarks concerning amenities, restaurants, tourist attractions, the weather, etc."
1,Blaspheme,"Christians boycott this blasphemous fiction....All Honor and Glory to the Son of God, Jesus, Christ, Savior, Redeemer who lived committing no sin while he was in the flesh on this Earth. UPON HIS REVELATION ""EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW AND EVERY TONGUE CONFESS THAT JESUS IS THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY"""
4,JUST HAS A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART,Lauren German just has my soul in the palm of her hand when she's on the dance floor movin' to Ferry Corsten's Punk...
2,Caution - try the camera out in a shop,"I would highly recommend playing around with this camera in a shop before ordering online. ...but when I received it, I found a lot of defects that finally made me return the camera for a refund.It started with the weird design of the On/Off buttons. It was so tight that I broke my nail trying to turn it around. I tried some recording with zooms, and the time taken for the camera to focus sharp on a zoomed object was slow enough to blur the zoomed object. The camera is light, but the shape is weird with a pointing lens. When I switched to playback mode to review my recording, it took me 3 minutes for the 2 minute recording to rewind to the beginning of the tape..."
2,Depends On What You Do With It,"I got this camera about 6 months ago for my birthday and it seemed pretty cool at first. After a few weeks though it said that, ""Head cleaning,"" was requiered of it, so I bought a cleaning tape and used it whenever it said to, but the problem was that after 5 minutes of using it said to use it again. This is still happening with it, and unfortunatley makes the video appear choppy and with res. lines through it. Also I use it to film skate videos, and it isnt the best camera for that becuase it cannot support a normal fisheye lense that is a 37mm. Also it does not have the best video quality, and often eats the tape if its not charged all the way. Although it is certinatly a low end of the line camcordere, I expected more from it. I would go with something smaller, and perhaps (more expensive) for a good camcorder."
1,Avoid this product,"I've had one of these for about 18 months...after a year of ownership it started eating DV tapes. I've had three destroyed when rewinding...you get an error message and the next thing you know your tape is in ribbons. Fortunately, I found a place that will repair them but it is expensive ($30 per tape).I contacted JVC about the problem...they were aware that their camcorders have this kind of issue but because mine was outside the warranty period they declined to do anything for me.If you do buy this camcorder (or already have it) try getting a separate miniDV rewinder for around $20. I've only had the tapes get eaten while rewinding.If you're still in the market for a camcorder...don't buy this one!"
3,Garageband NOT unique to Apple.,"Just to counter what one person said about ""nothing comes close"" on the PC. Garageband is simply Apple's version of Sonic Foundry's ACID, now owned by Sony, and you can download [...]Garageband will even import Acidloops I'm told.Don't get me wrong, I think the iLife Suite is great and I use both PC's and Mac's in equal measure but I get frustrated when Mac owners talk about how great Garageband and Final Cut are and how it's too bad there's nothing on the PC like it. Well, Final Cut is constantly playing catchup to Vegas Video and Acid has been around for years.That all said, there still isn't a worthy competitor to iMovie on the PC and my iBook is my constant companion for quick and dirty video editing on the road.J\"
5,Study and Clean,"PRO:Very Well Made... I got this when my glass french press broke for the third time, and I like that it keeps the coffee warm... I don't that feature that much because the coffee is gone long before it is cold...Great addition to my Coffee making obsession...Only Unrelated CON:I can't see how much coffee is left but that isn't a con of the product but my personal preference because I am used to the glass style."
2,coffee passion,"This coffee press is very nice looking, and maybe what I call a cup 'hand thrown mugs"" are not considered one cup mugs, but this makes two really nice cups of press coffee 'not eight' cups as advertised. Still very stylish and no glass which I have broken twice with the glass ones. It will keep the two cups hot longer then glass."
1,Don't buy if you have OS X,"This program will run in OS X, but that's about it. We had all kinds of problems. Not able to save, can't print, won't insert graphics and on and on.It could have been a good program if they just converted it for OS X, but we're sending it back."
1,"I bought it for my mac, but I keep getting a message that says my Mac doesn't support this program.",This Print Shop program is not supported on my Mac. I'm going to have to purchase yet another one. VERY DISAPPOINTING.
3,Disappointing,I found this book very disappointing.It was hard to follow all the characters.Margaret Maron is a talented author. This book is not one of her best efforts.
2,Vain effort,"It is easy to assign quite a few positive literary judgements to Markovits' novel: the text is carefully constructed, the author is well-read, the images are well-chosen and so on. Still, he doesn't manage to captivate neither the reader nor his imagination. The points Markovits has to make are not trivial, but they aren't new either. As a consequence, the whole text appears to be a literary ""etude"" rather than a work of art.The characters are passed on from chapter to chapter - each a short story in itself. The spotlights from each form the ""whole picture"" in the end. But due to the novel's fine but rather artificial construction, the detail spent on character description is finally lost: all is artifice without live.Through Markovits' need for controlling his characters as well as his style, the whole text seems strangely out-of-date, as if he had written it along the rules set down in a creative-writing-guide from the fifties."
4,Way too overpriced by this provider!,"Talk about highway robbery, this supplier is wanting more than double of what I've paid for these Softballs. With the economy the way it currently is, I don't think that there will be many customers buying from this supplier!"
4,proven performer,"a lot of photojournalists have this, and its easy to see why: fast shutter speed and af, good ergonomics, many lens options, nikon quality. at 6 mp, d70 proves megapixels arent the be-all and end all, it's what you do with 'em. kit lens is sharp, too.but i'd still want to go with the newer and better d80 if you can afford it, maybe even the d40 if you can't. the d70 is a great camera which had its place in the sun, but is now obsolete. still, if you're upgrading from a P&S;, this will seem like a godsend. if you're lucky, you can scoop it up on closeout and save even more."
1,Overpriced at new,"Do not buy the NEW d70s for over $2000. Although a good camera, it is years old and newer, better Nikons are available for less."
4,First gangster rap from the first gangster rapper,"Schoolly D from Philadelphia is commonly credited with being the first gangster rapper. This CD is a Japanese released CD from Rykodisc (everything is in English however) that is a compilation of songs from his first 2 LPs.If you just want to see what Schoolly D is about, tryThe Best of Schoolly DorThe Jive Collection, Vol. 3which both have the same tracks as each other. Hunt this one down only if you are a hard core Schoolly D fan who wants as much early stuff as you can get."
2,it was ok,"Not really what I expected. It was a bit of a bored, but the drawing and the cover almost makes it worth it. ALMOST"
2,Good show,"I like the show, but please don't split the sason for sales.. Wait until you have complete season, then sell..."
5,Angry grotesque manifestations,"Not the typical haunted house story with lingering ghosts of past residents, the ghosts in Stehle's Door can relocate causing bad dreams, having grotesque manifestations, and worse. A chilling, compelling story of two adolescents who fight the unpredictable with risk and determination. The movement to another realm appealed to me as in The Sixth Sense and I liked the confiding between kids which was reminiscent of the book The Other."
5,laugh out loud,"Deg Lasdio has really hit a nerve, or should I say funny bone, with this hilarious sendup of all those people who drive us crazy at work, wherever that may happen to be. Everyone will recognize most of these types, and the short format of the descriptions make the book perfect for brief bursts of reading. It's hard to read surreptitiously, though, because howling with laughter occurs all too often. The acronyms, nicknames and the fun illustrations really added to my enjoyment of this charming and wickedly perceptive book."
4,"Great product, cat figured it out too fast.","Smart product, even smarter cat. For the first couple days we were so happy not to have to force pills down kitty's throat...then she figured out the pills are inside and stopped eating them. Worth a try tho!"
5,pill pockets,These work great for vitamins cats dont like. My cats love the taste of these pill pockets and dont notice vitamin inside to much.
1,Just Awful,"My cats wouldn't eat them even without pills in them. I have one cat who is fussy so this wasn't a surprise, but I have another cat who will eat anything on the floor, including non-food items, but would not touch these ""treats."""
2,My cat won't eat them,I had high hopes for this product. My cat has to take a pill twice a day and I thought I would give this stuff a try. He sniffs the pocket and walks away. I even tried getting him to eat the pockets without the pill inside. He just doesn't see it as food or a treat. Oh well.
2,most won't eat them,"I take in stray cats. I currently have 14. When one comes down with something possibly contagious, all go on antibiotics. The other week I picked up some antibiotics at the vet and then went and got these at the pet store ($8!!!). I was so happy that pilling this many cats was finally going to be so simple and easy for a change.Imagine my shock and annoyance when 10 of the 14 refused to eat them. The four that like them, love them, but the rest smell them and walk away."
3,The Fickleness of Felines,"I consider this a high quality product and two vets that I know highly recommend (and sell) these. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is that only 2 of my 5 cat children liked these as well as their regular treats. Also, I was using them as treats and not to give pills, as I find it much easier to give pills with the plastic pill ""popper"" utensil I got from the vet. You put the pill in one end, pull back on the handle at the other end, hold open the cat's mouth and ""inject"" the pill with no chance of being bitten and it's so quick and easy that it's a lot easier on them. Just a thought/alternative."
2,"Good idea, but not for finicky cats.","The concept is great (hence the extra star), but this is definitely a hit-or-miss product. Unfortunately, it was a miss for us. I tried giving my cat a piece of pill pocket (salmon) without medicine, and she wouldn't touch it. I am going to try grinding some of her favorite treats and rolling the pill pocket in it. If it works, I will update my review."
2,Caution,Do your research on the web before buying this product. Many cats and dogs have suffered severe health problems as a possible result of using this product. I have an older cat who requires medication and I gave this to him and he vomited profusely hours after I gave him two of these pill pockets. These do not work for every pet.
1,Joke,this book is a joke. The typical run-around answers Christians always seem to give when posed with a paradox in their faith
2,2.5 rating is most appropriate.,"I purchased this book sometime ago while I was taking financial accounting courses. I found that my required text book did not have adequate examples of how to solve various problems. I did not find this to be a good supplement or aide during the courses. Gleim offers a similar book as well as a five-part series question and answer books and test-prep software for every aspect of accounting; while its' offering is more expensive I think it is a better supplement overall. I would recommend Schaum to take a look at how current financial accounting textbooks are made and try to create book that will work more as a supplement to a person's primary text. Overall, this book just doesn't get the job done."
1,Five habits for Happiness,I listened to Five Habits for Happiness and was astounded to find that this self-help tape was more depressing than inspiring and uplifting.Each story told by the author/narrator is depressing and brings you down so that by the end of the segment anything that the author says about the Five Habits for happpiness is somewhat uplifting. You feel relief when he is done telling all of his stories.I don't find that to be self-help and/or encouraging at all.
4,Good CD,"This is a good CD with good rythm. Some ill beats straight out of the webster hall dance floors. If you've never been there and want to get a taste of what its like, then buy this CD. Its a perfect representation."
5,great read,"For the lover of the holiday or social history fan. Many interesting details found within. Well written, a keeper you'll want to re-read every other year or so."
3,"Wonderful performances, dingy denouement","This movie starts beautifully and the first 60-70 minutes actually work very well. Performances are marvelous, particularly Miller and Hawes, and you do get caught up in it.It seems to be picking up speed and then it becomes a ""Law and Order: SVU"" episode.All in all though, not a bad little movie."
4,Weirdo Video Collage,Some videos are better than others but overall I really liked it. My favorite was the one with the q-tips.
4,Good but dated.,"Its a very good -but dated- reference book to have at your disposal. Unfortunately if I ever find any discrepancy with Cambell's book and the ""Navweapons. Com"" internet site, I always defer to the latter.[...]I can certainly do without the editorializing in John Campbell's work.Now if the 'NAVWEAPONS' people every got around to turning their database into book format, I would be `all over that'."
4,Great watch -- has some long term durability issues,"For the price I paid this was a great watch. It does'nt have the latest features that came with it's replacement though.I liked that this watch had the kind of strap material it does -- no dirt/water worries, but after a lot of use (I'm not quite sure how long I've owned it) the small piece that holds the end of the strap down cracked and broke off, leaving the strap to stick out, and because of the material i couldn't easily fix it (with glue, for example)I ended up having to buy a new one, another Ironman Timex, but I don't like it quite as much as I liked this one."
1,Not for musicians!,"I just experienced my first WW exercise DVD. I HATED it. I have been a musician since I was 5 and this DVD drove me crazy. There is no coordination between the exercise motions and the rhythm of the rather laid-back music. I found myself, time after time, slowing my pace to the rhythm of the music. Other exercise DVDs can ""keep the beat."" I will go back to them until WW can get their act together!"
5,Not a good pet supply.,"These cakes are listed under ""Pet Supplies."" Let me be the first to tell you that these do not make good pet supplies. I gave one to my dog Pickle for going poopies outside and he didn't fare well. In fact, he died instantly. I know they are called Funny Bones, but seeing Pickle keel over in a pile of his own feces was not (entirely) funny, and these are not hard and marrow-filled like most bones. Perhaps these should be relisted under ""People Supplies"" or ""Dog Poison."" Other than Pickle's death, these are pretty tasty. I know because I regularly eat dog food. Five stars."
1,Never again.,"I had a slight cough, so I decided to eliminate it with Mucinex DM. Instead, within 1 hour, it eliminated my lunch. I had to sit on the john all day instead of studying for my final. Thanks, Mucinex."
4,great price,I use this a lot with my COPD and this was a better price than in store price I have paying.
4,Effective but hard to swallow,"The tablet is bigger than average. My husband had a hard time taking this medicine. It is effective in mucus relief, though it takes a little more effort to take in the tab. It also has a certain funky smell to it."
3,"Taken for mucous, not cough","Medication made me drowsy and sort of spacey. Almost sure that those who complained about jitters and not being able to sleep did not take Musinex DM; as someone observed, these people were probably taking Musinex D. I have one comment on extended-release(X) drugs--if you don't respond well to the drug, your stuck with it in your system for a long time. I would be very before wary of taking x-released drugs. In fact I avoid extended release drugs unless prescribed by doctor. Also, as a useful rule of thumb, be careful before taking over the counter, non-RX drugs. Do some research and ask your doctor. For example, many medications are put over the counter in less strength than RX of same drug--e.g. ibuprophen (active ingred. in Advil, MOtrin). RX strengh is 600 milligrams, prescribed by all doctors. Over the counter Ibuprophen is only 200 mg., so you must take 3 pills to get the amount you really should be taking."
4,introduction to knot theory,"This book asserts three subjects:-subfactor theory: It gives the possible values of the index, nevertheless it is too sketchy and one solely interested in this subject should read his inventiones papers.-knot theory: this is the best part of the books which explain without prerequisites and with great clarity the way to compute knot invariants.-a pot pourri about 'knot and statistical mechanics' generalization. This part is the worst since the book is now quite old and the idea are not clear.This book as the virtues of lectures (clarity, geometric ideas) and it's defaults (few computations, lack of rigor)"
5,Worth the price,"Wurth Glass CleanerSeems odd to spend this much money on glass cleaner, but if you know what it is like to have film on the inside of your windshield at night then give this a shot. Cleans w/o ammonia so you won't have to worry about damaging the car's interior or gagging on fumes. Does a thorough, really streak free job on all windows and head lights. One side benny is it works great on shower doors. It cuts through soap scum better than the scrubbing bubbles."
4,Put together your own railway (US:railroad),"The latest 2005 copy costs $1000.Buy the 1987 copy for $10 and use it for wallpaper!!!!Cut and paste your own railway.Full of maps and tables.Black and white, except perhaps for the cover.Being practical, the termendous difference in price between old and new versions of this uearbook, makes it sensible to start with an older cheaper copy and move only if the desired information is not available."
3,Avoid This Album,"I have been a huge Richard Cheese fan since I heard him a few years ago. I own all of his albums. They swing, baby.Here's the problem with SSotM: TBoRC -It is not really a best of album. It's a hodge-podge of tracks. Included are:*""Big Band Versions"" of songs from his first (poorly produced) album with additional instruments dubbed over it...not dubbed well, either.*A few sparse tracks from his middle 3 albums*A couple of new tracks that are good, but not as good as his middle 3 albums*A recycled cover from his list of ""spoof"" albums that don't really existIf you are a completist and a fan, then buy this album.If you are new to Dick, then I recommend the albums in this order:I'd Like a VirginTuxicityApertif for DestructionLounge Against the MachineSSotM: TBoRC"
5,More Fun Than a Barrel of monkees!,"Too much fun, although I don't think it was all his ""best"" songs. But c'mon, where can you go wrong with ""Closer"" (NIN), and ""Rape Me"" (Nirvana) in lounge style?"
3,can i get some cheese with my lounge music,this album has some really interesting versions of modern rock songs. but its not something that youre likely to listen to all the time. some songs are interesting and some just make you roll your eyes.
3,Good Little Laptop Desk,"I bought this to use with a couch, and it is just a bit too tall for that purpose, even pushed all the way down. It fits a 17"" laptop if you don't use a mouse. It's sturdy enough and I like that it's constructed to slide under a chair. If only my couch were elevated! It's light and easy to move around if you just want to get it out of the way.I wouldn't say it's terribly well made. I had trouble tightening the wheels with the cheapy wrench provided. Even using a real wrench, I had trouble-and not for lack of strength but something was off on the alignment, I think. A minor nitpick, and it did work out in the end.I think the price is good, but when you add the shipping it no longer seems like such a bargain. Plus, it is not a nice piece of furniture and that fake wood is fooling no one. But still, three stars for function and size."
3,Low Acid French Decaf,Pretty good. Does removal of the acid have to be at such cost? This coffee was expensive and somewhat disappointing. It lost it's robust edge you expect from french roast.
3,So-so,It gives a so-so effect to your pictures. You get what you are supposed to get but I thought that would look better.I prefer the result obtained with the plain filters.
4,Cleancut Commie Fun,"While not a world class musical, ""Hot Summer"" was certainly in the league of its contemporary American models. If you've seen the documentary about communist bloc musicals, ""East Side Story,"" you know that because of the communist system DEFA made very few musical comedies, so it's amazing that this film is as good and polished as it is. The director was talented and several of the actor/singers are very charismatic and likely would have done well in the West. In some ways the characters were more mature than their counterparts in Hollywood beach movies. For example, one character discusses the possibility of pregnancy.Still, this is a fun film. I hope Ice Storm International and First Run Features will bring out DEFA's ""Midnight Revue"" and ""No Cheating Darling;"" I think they'd do well."
2,Read John Barnes' other books instead!,"If I had not read any other John Barnes novels before this I might not have bothered and would have missed the brilliance of Mother of Storms, Orbital Resonance & Kaleidascope Century. This is a dull reworking of the 'Moon is a Harsh Mistress ' plot, with a bit of Charles Sheffield's 'Heritage' series thrown in at the end. Don't miss his other books - don't bother with this one."
4,Frommer's Alaska Cruises & Ports of Call 2002,"The book was shipped to me in very good condition and was here in 7 days. I find it very informative and am anxious to see Alaska. We have cruised before and Royal Caribbean is our cruise line of choice. I was interested in the book more for the suggestions for excursions, what the weather would be and what to pack. I would definitely order through amazon again."
2,Skid Shoe replacement,"Read description of this item carefully. Price is for ONE skid shoe, eventhough all snowblowers have TWO skid shoes that wear out at approximately the same time. This is not a replacement for all Toro snowblowers. The dimensions are correct, but the bolt slots are not. Very heavy duty but expensive for just one skid shoe. Would recomend that you take your skid shoes to a local retailer and match up not just the size but also the bolt pattern."
5,Not the Same Old Stuff,"Not the Same Old StuffMost of the books and white papers on CRM fall back on the same old ""culture and organization are the hardest part."" I think this is because it's easier for authors to write about other people than it is to write about how to implement a project as complex as CRM. This book provides an implementation roadmap, which was worth the price of admission."
5,Best dog toy EVER!,This thing has been driving my Puggle crazy for days. She can attack trying to get the inside ball for hours tiring herself out. Highly recommended for the driving doggie.
1,Sharp Edges,"There is a design flaw in this ball that shoppers should be aware of -- the edges of the round openings in the ball are very sharp. I watched my dog enthusiastically chase the ball around and bite at the openings trying to get the small inner ball out through the holes in the larger ball. When he stopped playing and ran back to me, I saw cuts on his mouth and muzzle; even one of his paws that he stuck through one of the holes, was cut. I then felt the edges of the openings in the outer ball and they were almost razor sharp. I took the ball away and we moved on to safer toys."
5,Love It,Our Dachshund has had this ball for over two years and he just now got the ball out of the inside. What an exciting moment! Well worth the money. I'm going to purchase some for gifts.
2,Chewers beware,Our 7month old Goldendoodle loved this ball...however within an hour I had to take it away as she was chewing the openings to get to the inner ball and could choke on the plastic she was ripping apart.
2,"Poor quality, Great Concept","For the price, I expected pet store quality. However, this toy is more of a Walmart/Dollar Store quality. The packaging isn't very impressive (almost like it was printed at home) and the outer ball is made of very hard plastic, almost like what you would expect from a television casing or something... My dog is a big chewer but I have to say I'm kind of nervous to give this to him in case he chips a tooth or something. The concept is really great which is why I'm keeping this but I think Jolly Pet can do better."
3,Mixed reaction,"I bought this CD for my wife based on the great review it got here on Amazon. We were disappointed.While there are many interpretations on this CD that I enjoyed, there are just as many that should have been left off. With some of them (e.g. track 6, It's Delovely) I had to refer back to the CD cover to read what it was that I was listening to. In other cases the quality of the recording is poor. And finally of course there is personal preference - some of the interpretations I just didn't like.I agree that there are many of the old masters performing on this CD. Some of them did however not have a good day when they recorded these songs.I was debating whether to give this CD 2 or 3 stars. It's more like a 2.5, so I give it a 3. I'll have to keep shopping for a Cole Porter collection that I like though."
2,Could have been much better!!,"I'm not a huge F1 fan but was curious about the use of multi-angle features on this disk. Was really expecting an ""in your face"" in-car driver perspective, with extended racing sequences....disappointed with final product. Very fragmented, difficult to follow, repetitive highlights, in-car clips too short too enjoy, pointless selectable race stats etc. Overall, they blew it! It could have been a great DVD if they had designed it to be a seamless experience for the fan! As it is, consider it a novelty disk, and of interest only to diehard F1 fans...If you want racing action checkout Super Speedway or Driven instead!"
4,i get a kick out of it.,"i just get a kick out of these things. total novelty, will never end up on my car. but i like it anyways"
1,Not sure about this,It may be a cutesy Darwin fish with sticky stuff on back but will it evolve? I'll wait to see if it lasts a few million years before I buy one.
1,"What good is an emblem, if you can't attatch it to your car?","This emblem looks decent. The problem is, it won't stick to anything. The adhesive strip on the back is very poor. I had tried to stick the emblem on the car, in the car, and finally to a piece of paper. Even when I placed the emblem on a piece of paper, the emblem fell off by itself. What is going on here? This is a very cheap product that I WOULD NOT recommend!"
3,Just the Facts please,"While the factual portions of this book are valuable, it could have been 50 pages long and consolidated the tables into one spreadsheet. An individual who is truly looking for the criteria the title describes does not need the whining of the ""guinea pigs"" as these authors describe themselves. The basic premises of portion control combined with eating the proper amounts of each group are the gist of the book."
2,This is a depressing work written by two diet policewomen.,"I don't doubt that the nutritional advice is sound. Almost anyone will be able to lose weight following their guidelines. But ""rev up your metabolism""?... you will be too depressed to be active. The Lakatos sisters take such a righteous, puritanical approach to what should and should not be eaten in what portions and when, that I found their advice a big turn off. I am a dieter and have lost 43 pounds in the last four and a half months, simply by counting my daily calories and eating balanced meals. If I had followed their plan, I would have given up after a few weeks."
4,It is a great read loaded with incredible descriptive language and fabulous content.,It was great and I would recommend it to someone else interested in the leadership of sir Winston Spencer Churchill.
3,lacking L-Glutathione,"Did not contain enough L-Glutathione. Only 50 mg. Perhaps, just not enough pep in their peptides."
5,EXCELLENT DVD!! A MUST FOR ALL AIC FANS!!,"If you're an Alice in Chains fan, please do youself a favor and buy this DVD. Not only are all their most popular hits included but the DVD has actual footage of the band members themselves. It is a treasure, as there is not much media to commemorate Layne Staley. I wish someone would do a life story or Biography."
5,SMART,"I installed Stopzilla and I immediately saw awesome results. This thing is kewl and I don't have to do anything when I install it...that's the best part. It just works, and it only kills the annoying ads. Before i bought this, I used to want to throw my computer out of the window!!!! Not any more.....great product!"
4,Great TV tuner\Graphics card combination.,"The ATI graphics work.I got the TV Tuner to work.However, I am still havingwith getting the compositesignal from my VCR to work.ATI should provide an easierway to connect this graphicscard to the VCR or DVD player."
1,A Poor Performer,"I had a previous Radeon AIW from 3 or 4 years ago. Performed well and had a great TV tuner. This card has a horrid tuner, picture quality and ability to change channels without issue. Also...it is not possible to disable the DVR function while viewing live TV.Overall, if you are looking for a good PC based TV card this isn't it. I didn't keep it long enough to see how it was with games but the difference in perfomance between my base Quadro card and the AIW 2006 is amazing. Movement is much more fluid with the Quadro.AND beware the software!!! Once you've installed it, good luck with removal. Had to use a freeware util to get it all out."
2,So-So Player,"We go thru portable DVDs at the rate of 1 per year. I bought this one specifically for use in the car. While the screen is a nice size, it has a number of defects. The case is insecure - the player falls out of it on sharp turns. There is no battery, the player only runs with a power source. And, the player has been inconsistent in use - it sometimes has to be turned off and on a couple of times to run. I'm much happier with the flat screen Audiovox with a velcro fastener and have already purchased a second one of those. I'm planning to give this player away."
1,Defective out of the Box,The player didn't work right out of the box. Returned for a credit and bought a Zenith at the local BestBuy.
4,Affair An Artist Had Forty Year Ago Produced A Daughter He Never Knew About,"English painter Sloane went to prison for faking art works. When released from prison near age 60 after serving several years he tried to restart his life. Years previously he had an affair with another artist Jane Graham who was now dying from cancer in Italy. He received an urgent letter from her and flew to see her. He met her lesbian lover Valentina and ultimately learned that he had fathered a daughter. He promised Jane that he would attempt to find her. He then flew to New York and the true adventures began. His daughter Connie had many problems. Drugs,liquor and a controlling,abusive murderering gangster boyfriend Vincent Delaney. Along the way he begins a romantic relationship with gallery owner Rachel Zander. He saves his daughter with the help of two New York City detectives Catherine Vargas and John Cherry. Interesting glimpses of the bohemian art world with some jazz music interludes. Good quick read."
1,Cheap,"Cheap, cheap, cheap. I had purchased a cherry luggage rack from the Bombay Company and was expecting the same quality in this order. Wrong! This rack was orange and did not resemble cherry at all. It was made in China, enough said. The box was mutilated but the rack was okay. However, I am embarassed to give it for a Christmas present. I cannot even return it because the box is ruined."
3,Good looking luggage rack but will it last?,"We ordered 2 of these for use at a summer house in Maine. We are basically happy with our purchase. The finish looks good and they seem pretty sturdy. They worked well for our house guests over Memorial Day weekend.However, when I looked at the underside of the wood support bar where the plastic webbing attaches I became a little nervous about its durability. Each web is stapled to the bar so close to the edge that I am concerned the wood might eventually split. The Chinese manufacturer was apparently so concerned to minimize the amount of webbing material used that they cut the webs as short as possible and the result is that the staples are within 1/4"" of the edge. I just hope they did some testing to verify the design. For now they work fine and we are going to keep them, but I do wish they had added another 1/2"" or so to the length of each web to put the staples further from the edge."
4,Easier than chess but just as fun,I got this game for Christmas for my 17 year old brother. The whole family was able to enjoy it. It's simple to learn the rules but it's a game of thought and strategy.
4,very nice,"my first westlake book, but surely not my last. very smooth entertainment and a nice step away from the more serious crime novels i tend to gravitate towards. i have to say though, there's a whole lotta commas in this book."
4,A Hairbrained Crime Novel,Donald Westgate is the master of crime novels. His amusing plots and crazy characters will make you laugh at the antics. You will not be able to set this one down. Look out for interesting twists and turns.
3,War Surplus?,"When I received this item the box was in such poor condition - not from the shipping - and it smelled so toxic it reminded me of war surplus - World War II surplus! Amazon is clearly not fullfilling it's responsibility to check-up on these third party suppliers it has posted on it's web site, this item looks as if it were purchased at a flea market and then sold through Amazon for a premium price. This has happened with my last several purchases from Amazon and I will cease to purchase here anymore if I can possibly find an item elsewhere. Which shouldn't be to difficult."
3,AN EARLY JACK KEROUAC,"HARRY KEMP, ASPIRING POET, HITS THE FREIGHTS AT A YOUNG AGE CIRCA 1910 AND STARTS GROWING UP. HIS EXPLOITS AND INSIGHTS ARE NOT ENTIRELY ORIGINAL, EXCEPT THAT IT'S INTERESTING THAT LITTLE (HUMANIST-WISE) WAS TERRIBLY DIFFERENT IN THOSE DAYS. VERY READABLE BOOK, HARRY HAD A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM, BUT NOT A STORY LIKELY TO REMAIN ETCHED IN YOUR MIND."
4,All you ever wanted to know about herbs for pets,Easy to read and look up problems. Recommended book from a friend--they knew what they were talking about. Good first book for learning about herbs and holistic properties.
1,Find another product.....,Plug and play? Plug and Pray! I have never had so much trouble with any other USB product.The drivers that came with the camera did not install it properly. Technical support instructed me to download and use the new driver. The new driver did not recognize the camera either. I was then told that the only way to get the camera to work was to REINSTALL WINDOWS 98. Out of sheer frustration and desperation I did so. The camera began to function but the sound quality was terrible. I replaced the mic with a cheapo from Radio Shack and sound improved drastically. I immediately boxed the camera up and returned it to the store from which I purchased it. I then purchased a 3COM home connect camera.I suggest you do the same.
4,This is really an awesome webcam,"I have heard people talked about the bad support and obsolete drivers about this camera. But for the image quality, this is the best one I have seen for webcams. This camera has a real CCD sensor other than cheap CMOS compared with other webcams. For the drivers, it could be downloaded from internet, working fine both with win2k and XP."
4,A Good Read,"This is a story of a spirited, meddling sprite and a lord that thinks that he must be above reproach. Anthony Elliot has single handedly save his family from ruin both financially and socially. The Elliot's are a disreputable family that has always been on the very edge of ruin.Anna Thraxton is a free spirit that has had to work to save her grandfather from debtors prison. She has become the premier governess in London. She handles only the worst children, turning then into angels.Anthony inherits his cousins five hellions and is determined to mold them into model citizens. He becomes desparate to find someone who can tame the children. He hires Anna hoping that she can make a difference.The minute that he touches her they each know that there is a powerful attraction between them. They both fight the attraction is varios ways but fate and love win the day. This is an enjoyable read that will leave you smiling."
1,STAY AWAY !!!!!,"WAS A SPECIAL GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER, AND AFTER 2 DAYS OF CHECKING LOTS OF WEBSITES, (OFFICIAL AND NON), IT JUST DID NOT WORK. IT WONT TURN ON. PERIOD. BOUGHT THE SANSA CLIP FOR MY WIFE, AWESOME. BUT THE SANSA EXPRESS, ACCORDING TO MY RECENT EXPERIENCE- BAD. STAY AWAY."
2,"Owned two, neither worked right","Its a good product in many ways, with a few huge exception: it doesn't read the music properly or at all, it freezes up a lot, and it has low durability. Try sansa clip plus...so far it has been working much better for me."
4,"good device, loses it's place often","This is a good MP3 player, if you want to audio books, it loses it's place often and you'll have to fast forward to find it again.. have had the 1 GB and the 2 GB of this model and they last pretty well... the 1GB is still kicking, just wanted bigger and thought a brand new one wouldn't lose it's place, sigh..."
3,Mind of its own,"I'm not looking for an MP3 player that has a mischievous bent. Roughly once a week, my player decides to empty out the playlist or the radio presets. All on its own. (Even when it has been in my pocket, playing away, with the lock on.) This is big on the hassle factor scale. There are plenty of MP3 players out there with a number of good features, and the Sansa Express is one of them. However, this random reset is not a feature that I like."
3,SanDisk 2 GB MP3 Player,"The menuing system is difficult to use. It certainly doesn't work as indicated in the instructions. Tech support had me reformat and then downloaded newer software, but that didn't solve the proble."
3,Good But Flawed,"This was an upgrade from a 256 MB Sansa.The sound is excellent and I love the small size and direct connection to my computer.However, the menu structure is inadequate for 2 GB, especially if you have a lot of individual songs. The only sorts are album, artist, and play list, and there are no subdirectories, even if you copy them in from Windows. Also, the fast forward works poorly for single files of over 30 minutes. Rather than a smooth scroll, it jumps randomly at increments of 6-8 minutes. This would be less annoying if the files did not occasionally reset to the beginning, seemingly at random."
1,"fragile, have not come to terms with the consumer","This is my third. Customer Service is thorny and not too helpful.Each exchange took several calls, 3 submissions and plenty of time before received.Sandisk is trying to expand their horizon of products to include more than flash memory, but has not incorporated the design team to go along with it. They fired their last CEO, and I think the current new product CEO is going as well.c'est a dire, They haven't come to terms with the consumer."
3,a fine player for me,"This is just fine for my needs. I didn't want anything too fancy or too complicated. Easy downloading, easy to use. I wish the buttons were a little bigger but overall it's perfect for my needs. I just wanted a player to listen to mp3's and that is what I got. I'm happy."
1,Only bought this because of Audible.,"I currently use a Sony Mp3 player, model # NWZ-S615F, and the only reason I ordered this little piece of junk was because my Sony isn't compatible with Audible. What a big mistake. First of all, it never fully charges. Doesn't matter how long it's plugged, it only charges about 2/3 of the way. Second, you can't turn it on/off without losing where you left off. I am constantly listening to audio books, and to have to fast-fwd through hours of content to see where I left off is ridiculous. I am not happy at all. I'm sticking with my Sony and screw Audible."
2,I should have read the reviews before purchase!,"I was please with this product for the first few months. Even if I had to charge the battery daily, it was a nice portable unit, and the size is outstanding.However, when I deleted songs off of it today, and replaced with new titles, I unplugged it from the computer, and the unit went blank. It will no longer turn on.Spend a bit more of your hard earned money, and get something that will last longer."
3,Cheap music storage and radio,"This MP3 player/radio plugs directly into a USB port on your computer. With better-than-provided head phones it does its job well. The controls, however, are touchy and tricky and not always responsive. I keep meaning to check with SanDisk to see if I got a defective unit.When I CAN make it work, I like it a lot."
3,Good but nothing special,"If you don't know much about the intelligence the U.S. had up to Pearl Harbor, and what was missed, this is as good a book as any.But it doesn't really break any new ground or find anything that is not covered elsewhere. And with our country making the same mistakes in the lead up to 9/11, at least we have a bit better understanding how people just don't connect the dots when they are not in a state of war mindset.That said, it is a well written book and of a good length."
2,The stand doesn't stand,The pins that lock this stand are so short that the least amount of moving will cause them to slip and the stand collapses. Fortunately I got this at a good price because I was sure disappointed in the performance of the stand. The chair itself is comfortable and easy to set up.
2,filter not the same in picture. doesn't fit well in fender.,"The picture shows an oval filter. I received a round filter. the filter is too big to fit through the hole in the fender so you have to attach the filter from under the car and inside the fenderwell. if you look inside your fenderwell before purchasing, you can see that there really isnt much room for anything right there.the seam where the fender attaches to the car rubs really hard on the filter after installation. i put several layers of heavy duty duct tape on the seam to protect my filter but i feel i will have to replace my filter down the road because of vibrations.If i were to do it again, i would buy a CAI that keeps the filter inside the hood area and has a heat shield.on a positive note. it is shiny and looks nice. It's just a pain to install and I fear how long the filter will last."
1,not what i wanted,not what i wanted was not made i guess i missed that on the items details so in stead of returning it's just sitting in my basement
5,A GENTLE GIANT,"I love the lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein, and that led me to this book. Now I love the lyricist. Fordin's biography is a joy, as Oscar surely was a joy, and, oh my gosh, how I would have adored having him as a friend! I was and am awed by his talent and his gentleness. The part of the book I love the most is the anecdote about how he wrote the lyrics to ""The Last Time I Saw Paris."" Can't tell you how many people I've told that story to--and how it moves me still. (Jerome Kern wrote the music to it and, according to The New York Times, it was the only time Kern ""strictly speaking...[would] deliberately write a song hit outside of a show or screen play."") I will be eternally grateful for all the shows that Oscar had a hand in writing and the pleasure they bring me to this day. So read the book, enjoy, and rejoice in getting to know this extraordinary man. Here is God's plenty."
5,Great Book,My local library where I live (Australia) has this book in the reserve collection. It is a great read. However why would you pay $100 for it. It retails for $18 from second hand dealers in Australia.
5,These threads are beautiful!,"What an assortment! They are so beautiful and with the storage case included they will stay dust free. 84 spools of thread in all those pretty colors. I will order again. Amazon prices are awesome, just check and compare and you see this assortment for much more. I wish they would do this in regular threads with 104 spools of polyester cotton."
1,"Good espresso, if it worked","Don't buy this machine. It makes pretty good espresso. But less than a year after I bought it, the milk frother stopped working. I sent it back to Briel and had it repaired. Fair enough. But a few months later, the machine stopped working altogether. No pressure build-up. No espresso."
4,Darwin's Four Great Books,I was pleased with this purchase. I found that the book was fairly priced and in great condition when it got to my house.
1,Dont Buy It-2 reasons,"1) I have owned three prior versions of this starting with the original MGI version, which is easier and allows you to do more. As another reviewer said, even version 4 is better...2) Strangely, it does not work well with other ROXIO software. Presently, on a NEW dell computer, I have to unistall Roxio videowave to use photosuite, and uninstall photosuite to use videowave. Techsupport, while helpful, were NOT able to resolve this, plus they take 3 days to reply to each email, making problem resolution a v.e.r.y. l.o.n.g. p.r.o.c.e.s.s! (you try one of their suggestions, then wait 3 DAYS for them to reply to any question..) Apparently, the shared Roxio CD Creator engine is the problem. We will never know, I gave up, and reinstalled MGI photosuite. Great features, works 100%, even has a lot of things they decided to drop from version 5."
5,Finally the whole story!,This is a must-read for anyone interested in knowing the complete story about the life and death of Bruce Lee. This book is about 25 years overdue! I extend my sincere gratitude to the author for having the guts and integrity to write this book.
1,What a piece of crap!,"Read several reviews about how great this movie which was supposed to be the best version.was. Even ordered the ""Gorehouse Greats"" edition Don't waste your time. Poorly acted and silly storyline"
2,One of the most boring of the Flashman series,Much time is spent for a plot that covers a very small period of time in history. A lot of re-hashing prior plots and more emphasis than necessary on Flashy's trashy exploits.
4,Very good (as all Flashman books are)but not the best,"Another great Flashman read, although certainly no where near as clever or funny as some of the early in the series. Some very interesting historical information as always, and Flashman is inserted into history rather well. But the scope/focus of the book is a little to narrow, and the main focus of the book really not all that interesting from a late 20th Century reader's perspective. Flashman's ideaology seems to come out rather more in this book, and its a bit of a worry from an experienced Flashman reader's point of view that he *has* one! :-) I'm looking forward to the book which details Flashy's exploits (or lack of them) in the US Civil War - I hope that will set the standad as a real Flashman classic."
4,appears to be a honest autobiography,"I bought this book at the airport out of desperation for something to read and was pleasantly suprised that I really liked it. I have read many autobiographies and feel that this is one of the rare ones that ""rings true"". It was a bit corny at times, but I liked the fact that Tanya ,at all times, took responsibility for her own actions. I'm about the same age as Tanya Tucker and although I am not a big country western fan, have followed her music through the years. I also felt that she went out of her way not to purposely slander anyone in an effort to set record straight. A great read. You go girl!!"
5,key fob for Ford,exactly as described. Arrived in about 1 week and in great shape. Still have not programmed it yet but have no reason to believe it won't work.
5,FINALLY - The Long awaited DVD,"Oh my God. I have 5 of Garfield's special on VHS. Now three are on DVD. This is a MUST have for any Garfield fan. I'm getting mine Tuesday as soon as the doors open. I can't believe it. I have been a Garfield fan since he came out. Thanks, Jim. You don't realize how happy you made us. This is amazing, I am so excited. Being age 33, I'm darn proud to be a Garfield fan. Keep them coming, Jim."
5,GOING TO BE THE BEST,"I HERD THAT GARFIELD IS COMING TO DVD AND IS GOING TO 3 OF GARFIELD'S SHOWS. I CAN'T WAIT BECAUSE I LOVE GARFIELD AND WILL PROBABLY BE FIRST IN LINE FOR THE MOVIE. I ALSO HAVE ALL OF THE GARFIELD BOOKS. THIS YEAR IS DEFINATLY THE YEAR OF GARFIELD. A DVD WITH 3 SHOWS, A MOVIE, AND HIS 40TH BOOK!"
4,Here comes Garfield.,"This is a classic film. Here are the shows and they're story.HERE COMES GARFIELD: Odie is kidnapped after annoying a neighbor, can Garfield save Odie???GARFIELD ON THE TOWN: On the way to the vet Garfield falls out of the car. Soon he finds his mother, his brother Roioll, and Sly. But can Garfield go home?GARFIELD GETS A LIFE: Jon needs to find the perfect match and Garfield helps. But, when he does find a match, Dreadful toughts are in Garfields head. Can he find happenies for everybody?I gave it 4 stars bechause the only trailer is lacking, but besides that, its a gem came true. (Based on DVD version.)"
5,Comfy and practical,Great item! Perfect fit for my 4-year old! Nice quality and she loves how pink everything is through the lens :)
2,"Well written, but I'm not sure why he bothered!","Hannah is an excellent writer. He slings words like a short-order cook slings hash. I liked his people, too; I believed in them, with the possible exception of the rather feckless cop.But the story didn't move me along, and when I put it down I was mostly disappointed that I'd spent however many hours (four? five?) reading it.I feel the same way about a lot of contemporary fiction. If you like Annie Proulx and writers like that, you may enjoy Barrah Hannah as well. Me, I think I'll stick to non-fiction from now on."
1,confused drivel from an egotistical mind,"Words that describe my impression of this work:A waste of my time.Too many characters. Brilliant sentences that become too self-conciously showy.Lack of attention to basic plot clarity.In short, this is not Southern fiction. This is Norman Mailer on a Southern vacation on steroids."
1,A sheer disappointment,"I have never reviewed a book for Amazon, but I had to say something about this one . . . I ordered the book only because of the reviews it was given on Amazon.com. Were they wrong! It's a book filled with so many characters, the reader cannot keep up; in fact, it seems as if the author only wanted to write character sketches, so he skipped the plot entirely. The narrator's tone is cynical and arrogant, not humorous and witty like the reviews promised. If I could give this book no stars, I would. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
5,Turn your brain on for this one.,"I generally read for fun. This indeed was fun but don't sit down to read lightly. Much of this is like reading poetry and I found myself reading many passages outloud to get the full emotion and feeling of the characters. Mr. Hannah is a writer in a different category to most, for in my opinion, he is truly an artist."
2,Misrepresented item,"This is a well made, reasonably priced, but, misrepresented skillet.If a skillet is advertised as a 12 inch skillet, it should have a 12 inch surface to cook on. This skillet actually measures 8 1/2 inches on the bottom. It is 12 inches at the top. I don't cook on the top, so, it was returned. If you are looking for a skillet that has an 8 1/2 inch bottom surface, this 12"" skillet is for you."
4,Addictive Thinking/Addictive Personality,"This,Addictive Thinking and the Addictive Personalityis an excellent book. It is one that I used in group counseling. The discussion in these groups are very open and honest. The people I work with ask questions, and they are interested in the material. This is a must read for counselors or want-to-be-counselor. It is also good for those who suffer from any addiction.Carter"
5,Elevated Feeder Purched at Amazon,This product is great. We have an older dog that has medical problems which makes it hard for him to bend down to feed so this product has improved his feeding time alot. Thanks for offering it.
3,cat dishes,"I maybe confused about what cats look like. I put in for raised cat dishes, does this look like a cat to anyone?OurPets SFL12BLK Healthy Pet Diner Elevated Feeder, Black, 12 Inches"
5,healthy feeder,"great feeder station, up off the floor and well made!!! Love it! exactly what I wanted and the price was right!!!"
3,okay,"I am not certain that this is quite four inches from the floor to where my shih tzu gets the food since the bowl sinks in. I am not crazy about the plastic, the bowls seem okay."
4,Great for the price and prime shipping,This product is just as advertised. It works well with our Boxer and she seems to really like eating and drinking from it. I would recommend this product.
1,Awful,"Under-researched, unedited, full of typos and errors. A right-wing physician returns from California to his native Croatia and writes a book about how evil Serbs are. Just racist nonsense by an outsider who really doesn't know much about the Balkans. Give it a pass. There are so many other books out there on the Yugoslav wars."
2,"Neat, but not for everyone","I bought this to use with a laptop. I could get the camera to point at me coming off the side of a laptop, but I couldn't get it straighten up, so at best, I had a 45 degree angle. I gave it away."
5,First-rate news and feature writing,"Veteran journalist Michael B. Davie has produced a first-rate collection of news and feature stories, along with his own expert commentary on what went into crafting these award-winning works of journalism.I especially enjoyed the story on a man named Malcolm who turned to lipsuction because he'd tried everything and couldn't get rid of his love handles. The lead sentence: ""The problem hit Malcolm in the middle.""I'd recommend this book to journalism students, practicing reporters and anyone who enjoys reading finely crafted news and feature articles."
2,The first one is enough...,"This second installment is basically just like the first installment. Nothing new, just continuing to reinvent the wheel. It's the same people stating the same information"
4,Great Documentary,"I'm really happy I decided to buy this dvd. I hadn't seen the first one, and I didn't feel lost watching this one. They did an incredible job in letting the truth speak for itself. I ended up buying the first one on VHS because I wanted to see everyone that was interviewed. I would've given it 5 stars if Mark Byers had been convicted by the end of the movie..."
2,"First ""Miss"" for us of a Melissa and Doug toy","First off, we are incredibly big fans of Melissa and Doug toys. Many of their great products have found a home in our house for years. We had very high hopes for this clock, and perhaps it is partly our fault for waiting until our son was almost 4 to introduce it to him. We truly wanted this as a teaching time toy, as he already knows his numbers and shapes. We had two problems, first, the hands do not stay in the clock face. I'm not sure if this is a universal design or if it's a fluke on ours. Also, when I try and hold the clock face vertical or almost vertical for demonstrating to our son, all the puzzle numbers fall out easily. Little things, but those are the issues my family had. As such, it became just a puzzle of sorts, which lost my son's attention after about 1 minute."
4,Great toy,"I got this for my 2 1/2 yr old son and he just loves it. I know he is still to young to understand what a clock is but he knows all of his numbers and he knows all of the basic shapes, but with this he is learning new shapes and he loves puzzles over all I love Melissa and Doug products I bought tons of there puzzles for my son and am never disappointed with any of them."
4,Learning for multiple ages,"I love that this clock puzzle toy can teach my kids different things at different ages. When we got it, she wasn't ready to learn detailed clock skills and she didn't recognize numbers. Now my son - at 20 months - is at that stage. He can still play with it by matching shapes and naming colors. For my daughter now at almost 4, she can identify the numbers, understand and move the hands, match it to another analog clock, count minutes and hours, and more.Also, I like that this is just what it is - it doesn't try to add to it by using batteries and singing a song. It doesn't need that. Its simplicity serves it well and makes it a great learning tool to use with the kids."
4,A well made toy that grows with your child,"I bought this for my son when he was two years old. At that time he was interested in it as a puzzle, and had so much fun putting the shapes where they belonged, as he did I would remind him what shape it is and the number on it. He quickly learned number recognition, and shape recognition. He is three and a half now and knows all of the shapes and numbers on the clock. He is just now getting interested in it as a clock. Time telling will come next.None of the paint has chipped and the wooden pieces are nice. This is a well made toy, it is bright and colorful and attracts attention from every child who visits.I rated it as four stars instead of 5 because I'm not sure it would hold every child's attention for very long periods of time. It just depends on the kid."
5,clock,Again this is for my grand daughter. She loves puzzles. She is 2 so still at times has to taste her toys un like the cardboard puzzles these survive her tastings. Wouldn't buy anything else.
5,"Solid construction, nice colors, useful for teaching numbers",Great product to teach kids numbers. The only concern is keeping track of the pieces which can be lost easily. Very satisfied.
1,doesn't work,I used the messina wildlife goose stopper and the geese walk and gaze right over it like nothing there. Wasted my money in buying it.
4,Emma Peel (The Avengers) Megaset,"If you are a fan of the Avengers then this is for you. Part of the series is in black and white, and part in colour as it was. Easy to play and easy to watch.Emma Peel and John Steed are government agents who tackle a variety of Mastermind type criminals, who have both political and financial gains to make. Steed is a relatively clever ""gentleman"" who knows all about wine etc. Mrs Peel on the other hand tends to be the one doing much of the fighting and is far the more intellectually clever of the team.If you are a UK customer check that you have a multi region DVD player, as it is Region 1 (USA).I did have a problem with the set; 1 received 2 of the 67-5 series and no 67-6 series. Amazon swiftly sorted the problem and sent me a new one."
5,EEE-URP!!!,"I'm already addicted to the show, it's smashing really! The actors, the wit, the sets, music.... I just love it! Despite the fact, that the show is 20 years older than I am, it's fantastic to see how the made films in the 60."
4,DVD,Met the description and I thought it was a fair assessment of the condition of the product.I am very happy with what I got.
3,The Avengers,This is an OK collection. I agree with others that it's too bad a whole series of shows were lost. They were actually the main reason I bought the CD's.
3,As Expected,"I ordered multiple textbooks through Amazon for this term at my local community college. I was very satisfied with the products I received. Though used, they were in great shape and at a great price, overall good value."
1,Too small- Not for over 5 yrs old,I wish I had seen the review from 11/30 before I ordered on 11/26 because it is correct. This product is not big enough for 8 yr olds . I felt dissapointed [...] MAKE SURE CHILD IS 3-5 as the actual box says.
1,BUSTED TOY,"My 4 year old loves harleys and loves this toy, although after 2 days it broke. Somehow the sound and lights just quit! The thing that amazes me is that he hasn't even had it outside!!! It has been raining and cold in our area, so he was riding it in my home on carpeting. I'm figuring it won't hold up well outside if it doesn't work after two days inside."
2,faulty toys,"I had bought this as a Christmas present for my nephew. He only got to play with it for 10 min. before it broke. I had to drive back into OKC to exchange it, for anthor toy because this product was not aval.!!!!!!"
4,price way out of line!,"My four year old got this scooter for his birthday. He loves it. It's great, but not for $80! I paid $20 at Toys R Us, and apparently it's so popular, you can't find it anywhere, and the price has gone up four fold. Sorry, while a great buy at $20, and maybe $25, it's a rip off at $80."
5,The children liked it.,"They are Berenstain Bears fans so this was hit with them, especially because I bought a play doctor kit also."
2,Disney Dress-up,"Sizes are VERY small. My two year could barely fit into these. She likes them, but they will only last a short time before she outgrows them. Very disappointed in sizing."
2,"Lots of typesets, and for what purpose?","I do not recommend it as an introduction to mathematical logic.I found the material to be insufficiently motivated. Unfortunately, the authors take some of their variables from an old english alphabet, which ruins the aesthetics. I am sure that some elegant and glorious principles are expounded here. But it was not written clearly enough for me to see them."
2,Depressed!,This is the worst ML textbook I have ever read!Not so bad in the contents but unfamiliar symbols and stylewould confuse you.Mendelson and Shoenfield's books are better options instead of this one!
5,A super book!,"For those who are mathematically inclined, this is the best upper-undergrad textbook introducing mathematical logic."
3,Pattern isn't as pretty as shown in the picture.,The cup isn't that deep to hold a lot of tea. And could be lighter as well.
5,a must for any student of religion,this book is an absolute must for anyone interested in religion and for those who question the validity of christianity's claim of infallibility. It reveals the making of the christian myth. highly recommended...sam wein
1,Just Garbage,"Typical preconceived conclusions hidden thinly behind the author's own elaborately constructed fantasy. No foot notes. No source material. No substatiation or support of his views. It reminded me of a debunker's book on UFO's although the scholorship was not as good. It amazes me to what lengths this ""author"" goes to construct his very own myth. No Christian ""mythmaker"" could match him!Don't waste your time with this. There are far more balanced texts available. This book seemed more constructed to impress the author's eastern liberal establishment friends than to credibly address the subject."
5,Most useful book in the genre,"By comparison with folks like John Dominic Crossan and Richard Friedman, the work of both of which are excellent, this book is smaller and covers a wider range of material. The writing is clear and makes use of as many of the contemporary contributing sciences as the others. This is one I review prior to any classroom discussions concerning the topic.I recommend this book as a good source for students trying to get a quick picture of contemporary scholarship on the NT."
3,Worth the wait - almost,"Lovers of Menotti's stunning opera have been waiting for years for a modern recording, since the original Broadway cast LP seems to have vanished with no hope of re-issue. This new version from the Spoleto Festival of 2001 is welcome, but disappointing.The chorus and orchestra under Richard Hickox are first-rate and the massed choral pieces like the San Gennaro scene are beutifully done. However, the principal singers, particularly Julia Melinek in the admittedly demanding role of Annina are inadequate. Ms Melinek has a fearsome wobble and sings off-pitch, making her first-act aria is painful to hear. Timothy Richards as Michele over-emotes and pushes his medium-sized tenor. No David Poleri he. The rest of the cast, notably Sandra Zeltzer as Carmela and Amelia Farrugia as Maria Corona, do quite well.Until another one comes along, this is still worth having, just to hear this ever-fascinating opera again."
2,"Wobbly and ""where is that pitch??""","As a soprano learning the role of Annina I'm very disappointed with the Annina in this recording. Her wobble is so large that often times you cannot figure out which pitch she is trying to hit. I have to play the notes on the piano to hear what they are really supposed to be and have found many that are way off. Thank God I can play through the piano score to learn the part correctly. The other sopranos are fabulous! Why, why, why then, did they hire Julia Melinek to sing the Annina??!! I cringe every time I have to listen to her and am embarrassed to share it with anyone feeling it will further propagate the myth that opera singing sounds like that. Instead of using the pianos written into the first part of ""Oh Sweet Jesus"" it sounds like Julia either cannot do pianos or decided it is better to show how large her voice is rather than express the text and feelings."
4,Informative and thought provoking.,"Everything Professor Gottesfeld has to say is smart, important and even fun to read. He is one of a handful of very bright people who do everything well. His ideas reflect a clairvoyant and playful mind that's patient enough to unravel and simplify, not dumb down, the arcane and lofty ideas of psychology to something that the rest of us can understand."
5,A Source for Comprehensive Assessment,"Barkley & Murphy offer a superb resource for the beginning and seasoned clinician who seeks to provide thorough screening for the cluster of potential psychiatric issues surrounding the 'ADHD' phenomenon.This resource is based on the findings of ongoing best practices research. It offers multiple refereces. And it offers many suggestions for ongoing assessment.This resource is particularly useful for those clinicians who communicate regularly with primary care providers as a means of documenting progress or raising questions about modifying treatment strategies.Finally, it serves to discover behavioral data which is so vital when considering medication as a therapeutic strategy."
5,"A Review of Styx "" One with everything""",5 Stars See my video review on You Tub. put MrWm2800 in the You Tub search box to bring up this as well as several other concert reviews
3,Almost good,"I bought this toy for my 2 year old. The first time out, it ran alright, but the tires have little traction on grass, and dont do well on gravel. The battery is a pain to keep a GOOD charge, which is frustrating. My son pushes it more than he rides, because he spins out and cant move on my lawn, which is flat. If it kept a better charge and had more traction, I would definatly reccomend this toy, as it teaches motor skills, and cause and effect."
2,Picture looks better than the actual product,"I ordered this because I loved the color and design. The actual stone is an aqua color, not smoky blue. The design is lovely. I am going to keep it because the cut on the stone is very nice and it's a fun ring. But if you order one of these, realize it may no look at all like the picture."
2,Looked Like it came from a carnival or a machine with a claw.,"It was supposed to be a part of a Halloween costume, but I didn't want to give it to my son due to it very cheap appearance."
2,Not very good,This radio worked for 2 years and even though the manufacturer offers 5 year 'consumer protection' they want $70 flat fee to fix it. For the 2 years it worked the FM reception was poor and the audio distorted. The display is so dim you'll never be able to see this in daylight on a boat.
4,Fine so far.,"Chair was easy to assemble with clear instructions. It is also well sized: fitting perfectly in a standard (read: small) tub and having a range of useful height settings. Tubing looks and feels like aluminum and should resist rusting (a major problem with some inexpensive chairs). It is also light and easy to move with one-hand. So far the chair has proven stable. The seat and back are textured which may make it difficult to clean. Also the tubing that attaches to the underside of the seat and the back of the back-rest sit in deep grooves. Likely these provide some structural stability, but may also prove difficult to clean thoroughly.After a few weeks use I can say I'm very pleased with this inexpensive shower chair. Assuming it proves reasonably durable in the long term, I will consider it a great bargain."
1,Bad company,"They sent me the wrong size box, and they never answered my email asking to pay me the difference for the different size, and they never got back to me. I will never order from them again..."
3,A black comedy thats isn't as good as the reviews,"This book garnered many accolades from newspapers and magazines. After reading it, I am still left wondering why. Yes, it is a good black comedy...a reflection of what lengths a man might think of going to in the middle class, blue collar working environment that many of us live in today, in order to survive. But the story got very repetetive. The pace and ideas Westlake gives us are excellent but after reading this book, it leaves you wondering what was the big deal."
4,Truer than you think...,"If you think Donald Westlake's ""The Ax"" is pure fiction, think again. Last year the Bank of America eliminated 19,000 jobs (more than ten percent of its workforce) while at the same time paying its top three executives (Hugh McColl, Kenneth Lewis, and James Hance) compensation packages worth $76 million, $44 million, and $44 million, respectively. That's $164 million to just three employees! The next sound you hear may just be the scrape of a whetstone across the blade of an ax. Wait! Make that 19,000 axes!"
4,THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THE REVIEW IMMEDIATELY BELOW,"THE REVIEW IMMEDIATELY BELOW WAS CUT OFF IN MID-SENTENCE. IT CONTINUES HERE.increase profits by releasing 10 people why shouldn't I do it? What, do I owe these people welfare? Should I augment their standard of living at my expense? Come to think of it, why don't they spontaneously decide to take a reduced salary and send ME money? Question, why does Devore think it's okay to increase HIS profits by putting a 9mm Parabellum slug through one man's eye, and crushing the skull of another with a hammer, yet thinks it is despicable for a CEO to increase the profits of thousands simply by laying people off?Sorry for the preaching, but Westlake did so much himself that I felt justified.Still a good book, well worth the price."
1,Leave it on the shelf,"Not the Westlake I've come to know. One of the most distubing books I've ever read. What this society does not need is a primer on murder, how to do it, and how to rationalize it. Can't we outgrow this everybody's-a-vicitm-and thereford-not-responsible attitude? Don't waste your time on this one"
1,"If you are looking for a good read, forget this one.","I read most of the reviews before I ordered this book.That was my mistake. I gave more credit to the 10s' than I did to the 1. Never again. I agree with the reader from Mass. This is almost the worst book I have ever read. So bad, I couldn't finish it after reading the first three or four murders. Ugh!!!"
1,NEVER RECEIVED,I never received the product but they did give me my money back. The shipping would have been more than the prodcut.
5,Nicholas' Reveiw,The Book Caleb's Story Tells About How A Boy And A Girl Were Playing Tag Then Finds A Man Sleeping Behind Their Barn.Later In The Story It Talks About How That Boy And That Girl Find Out That That Man Was Their Grandfather.Meanwhile It Definds How They Discover That Grandfather Was Taking Pain killers For His Heart.At The End It Talks About How Grandfather Passes Away Because Of His Heart Trouble. My Personal Opinon Of The Book Is Great.I Like How The Author Puts A Lot Of Details In The Story.What I Didn't Like Is How The Author Desribes The Grandfather Death.
3,Tae Kwon Do for Kids,"I found this title rather diappointing. If you are the take it at home type and don't actually attend a Tae Kwon Do class you may find this helpful. Although I must say that the information is acurate. But anyone who attends classes and get this title will be disappointed as well. Mr. Yates is ususally a VERY good author, this book does not do him justice."
1,Code in book is hard to follow and does not work....,"this book appeared to be on the cutting edge. Unfortunatly, it appears the authors were in such a hurry to get it on the streets that they skipped the editing phase. Lots of errors and the code (scripts) are incomplete.To bad, because it sure started out with a lot of promise, to bad it didn't deliver"
4,Wonderful blend of Norwegian scenery and music,"I was thrilled to finally find the Song of Norway in video, as I had seen it back in 1971 when it was out in the theaters. It was the reason I decided to visit Norway in 1972. Although the acting is not the best, the scenery and music from Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg make it very worth while. If you are familiar at all with Grieg's music, you will realize the composers of the music from this film took some liberty to change, add and adapt to make his compositions ""singable"". The story gives us a realistic look at the difficulties Edvard Grieg had in making a name for himself and a look at Norway in the mid 1800's. It's enjoyable, light entertainment, not to be taken too seriously, but with a strong message of friendship, loyalty and priorities."
1,Doesn't do anything for the music of Grieg,"My parents, being classical music lovers, excitedly took me to see this thing when it came out (I was eleven). Mercifully, I fell asleep watching it. I haven't seen it since then and I STILL remember how awful it was. For an example of how a GOOD movie can be made around classical music, I recommend Amadeus instead of this."
1,"Even TV found it inaccurate, and worse, boring","Originally contracted for a cable network, it contained such massive inaccuracies that the network wouldn't show it. Seriously, though, Katie Holmes as Jackie Kennedy Onassis? Greg Kinnear as JFK? I like Kinnear, he does good light comedy, but that's not what's called for here. Don't waste your time unless your ideology needs support."
4,White Limousine A Fun Drive,"Mellow sounds grace the latest release from Duncan Sheik, with soulful lyrics and subdued grooves. Two favorites of mine so far have been ""Hey, Casanova"" and the title track, ""White Limousine"".Also, if you have musical inclinations of your own, you'll enjoy the second disk in the set, which contains full bandwidth .WAV files of the different tracks on the album, which you can load into your favorite music application to remix as you feel inspired!"
2,"Interesting, but lacking.","I ordered this deck without knowing anything about it, and I have to say that I at least was not really very impressed. The artwork to me seemed almost to be just made up of clip art. The images used on each card did not seem to have anything to do with the card itself. They were stylish, and one could say pretty in what I found an unremarkable way. But that is all, these cards did not speak to me."
4,Fun way to learn about the Trojan War!,I read this book just after reading the Odyssey and while I started reading the Iliad. It was a nice way to help me understand who's who in those books and what exactly happened when Homer flashes back! All those Greek names can get a bit mixed up after a while and putting a picture in my mind really helped me.Did I mention that this is a neat book? :)
5,"Move Over Baby Einstein, Bear Bear and Messer is here","In our house we have alot of Baby Einstein videos, but they've never fully engaged my kids, like this dvd has. They love Bear Bear and Messer!!!! My children love the music and the adorable characters. I finally have some time to take care of things while they watch tv. Thank you for this wonderful dvd!"
1,Disappointing series for Little House fans,"I found this entire series of books to be disappointing because it was more cynical than the original series. On doing some research I discovered that chapters in least one of the final books were actually taken (almost verbatim) from Rose's writings for an adult audience. The story is totally out of character with the series. Rose and her friend sneak out for several nights to meet a traveling salesman. He eventually makes a pass at her...The listed author for this book (MacBride) died before the last few books were published and whether he had anything to do with the books is questionable.This series is okay as light reading for adolescents but if you are looking for a piece of americana, and/or a wholesome book for your child this is not the best choice. It grossly fails to live up to the original series of books. The Caroline series is a better choice."
5,The Other Side of the Hill!!!,"I like this book!! It is a great book!! It talks about Rose when she is growing up and she is with her mother and father which are Laura Ingalls and Almanzo Wilder. I think out of all the Little House Girls, Rose is my favorite but sometimes she can be a brat and spolied espically on New Dawn on Rocky Ridge."
3,Sex and the City Game,It is a fun game - a little confusing to get started. You definately have to be more then an avid fan to answer the questions.
3,"Good product, but tight on my head","I've had the headphones for a few months already, and I have had many problems when pairing them, but I suppose it is because of the Treo poor Bluetooth connectivity manager, or because of the drivers on my pc.A major drawback that I have found is the pressure it applies to the head, is a bit too much. The problem, is after an hour of using them, I get a headache. This is a real problem, since I have tried to open them a bit more, but the way the plastic band is done, it doesn't allow it.A minor drawback is the size, since they are very obvious on my ears (normal person), it makes wearing them a bit uncomfortable, and for sure rules out using them on the street, if you don't want to attract thieves that is.Aside from that, on my perspective the sound is good, the microphone works very well, the battery charge is good, volume and other buttons work properly. I use them to go jogging, and I must say they work pretty well even under stress and harsh situations."
2,Not compatible with the Blackberry Curve,"I just got my headphones. They worked for phone calls (with some static), but I couldn't play music through them. The buttons work as far as pausing and skipping songs, but no music through the headphones. I contacted Jabra and found out it isn't compatible with the Curve. Would've been nice to know ahead of time. These are a little expensive to be just a remote control for my phone's music player.Check the Jabra website before purchasing to make sure they are compatible. Just because your phone supports advanced audio doesn't mean these will work with it."
1,dont waste your money,these headphones were a waste of money they keep shutting off it is difficult to pair with laptop and cellphone the volume is very low the music on my cellphone plays then just stops like every minute. total garbarge
4,works as far as I've taken it,"So I have a Treo 650 with Pocket Tunes, and I can only get wired headsets to work with it for playing music. I've used Softick Audio Gateway to set that up now and can listen through these phone, so far only monoBUT... I also have a Bluetooth laptop, that I listen to books-on-tape with, and I do get stereo sound; the controls work with itunes for pausing, skipping tracks forward and backwards.AND... I can listen to these tunes and when a bluetooth call comes in on my bluetooth paired phone, it pauses and allows me to answer the call.Pretty cool, now I can go around doing housework while TCB.I still haven't figured out how to get two bluetooth phones to pair with stereo headphones? Yes I have a work phone and a personal phone. That would be ideal"
3,Decent head set,"Sound quality is decent, gets a little static if you have the phone down in a low pocket close to your body. I was only disappointed in the fact that they only work with the phone not the MP3 player in my phone."
2,Works when the planets are aligned,"First time I set it up with my cellphone they worked great. But then I configured my computer to talk with the headphones as well. Then they stopped working with my cellphone. Tech support could only suggest re-establishing the link with my cellphone. Only after they completed drained the batteries could I get them to work with the cellphone again. After less than a years use the left ear has stopped working. Reception has been hit or miss too. As I would walk with my cellphone in my pocket, the audio would cut out. The only way I could reliably keep it working is by holding my cellphone in my hand as I walked. Finally all I heard from family members was that they make me look goofy or ""don't go out in public wearing them"""
5,The best,I love being able to use these with my phone and MP3 player. It is so neat to hear a person talking in stereo. I love this product. It is well worth the money.
2,Too much bass,"It works.However, the sound is quite bad. The bass are very much boosted, too much boosted, so that medium and treebles are not clear. I usually add bass when I listen music because I like them, but those headset bass are way to strong and even unpleasant, I get an ear pain after a few minutes. The difference between normal wired devices and this one is even more striking when using the TV where bass are not usually strong and unnecessary for most programms.In addition, there can be a delay in the delivered sound, causing a kind of mismatch between sound and images."
1,Can Clog Your AC System and Cost More to Fix,"No it's not as easy is filling your AC with this and driving off with AC for eternity. AC systems are complicated and the only things that really belong in there are refrigerant and oil.If you have a leak or if you've ever opened your AC system chances are you have moisture in your system as well. In the old days (R12) this would form hydrofluoric acid and eat your AC system from the inside out.Nowadays it results in decreased efficiency. However, if you add Super Seal, the water activates the Super Seal and causes all sorts of problems. I took apart my AC system after it stopped working with Super Seal and found an orifice tube clogged beyond belief.If you do decide to use this product make sure you vacuum out your system before using it."
1,"Junk, this is trash!!!","This quick connect does not fit on a 2007 Dorango, so the crap just sprays out all over the place. What a pile of junk and wast of $33.33 after it said free shipping they charged me $7.38 shipping. Crap seller with crap product. Don't buy this junk. I wish I could take stars away instead of having to give one, thats 5 to many."
5,"To put it simply, amazing.","This series is wonderful. The art work is fantastic. The story line is epic and awesome. I haven't even seen Resurrection yet but I could not wait to say to someone how wonderful it is. I hear people complain about how short it is, but I think its the perfect length for the story. The quality is much better than on Netflix or how it was originally on Spike. I had played the game back when I was smaller but I never really thought it would be a good series. I used to like it for all the violence, but its much more than that. The violence isn't for no reason either, it has purpose, unlike a lot of shows/movies that try to draw you in with blood and gore. I can now appriciate it for what it really is, a fantastic series. 10/5 stars in my opinion. Definitely one of the best animes I have ever seen, and that is one of many."
5,Winning Defense Made Easy!,"Given to me by a women's college coach,this is the best book I've seen that breaks defensive skills into not only specific drills BUT tells which defense needs this skill and which does not. I am amazed at the insight some of the drills portray. I thank him for writing this book."
3,I wish,They are what they are... I wish they were a little snugger on the rails. I ended up soldering them all to the track
3,Nothing special,"Oneness is a great idea, but i think it implodes itself with it's own truths. Let's face it, half of all the shared beliefs break down to one belief, and that's the Golden Rule which is stated on page one. Plus ""There is one God"" does not hold true for all religions. The format of some sections are very nice, but others are simply pretentious. Definitely worth a read but there was really nothing new for me."
5,"A ""must have"" for the spiritual library","This small book, written simply yet powerfully, distills the pragmatic essence of the world's great spiritual traditions. I read it over and over, awestruck by the unity of insight among the diverse contributors to the spritual literature. This uplifting book fills the reader with peace, direction, and ""oneness"". The value far exceeds the price."
5,Pyramex full brim hard hat,I am very susceptable to skin cancers on my face and ears. This full brim hat should provide coverage for these areas from the rays of the sun.
4,Overall good shoes,These shoes are comfortable and seem like they'll last a lifetime. The only problem I have since i Just got them today is I wore them for only about an hour and the bottom already has chips.
2,Not Top Quality,I bought this Go set for Christmas. The board itself was decent but the go stones were irregular and poorly made. The lids to the bowls didn't fit properly and one of the bowls had a hole in the side from where a gnot had popped. Definitely not what I paid for!
3,Not Universal,"They advertise it as being universal but I have a new skil 10 table saw and it fell thru the opening in the stand.I had to buy a 3/4 plywood to make a base for it to fit, but I like the concept of the stand. They should note the opening size for the base but they don't and I had to buy it then find out later."
1,The worst TV ever!!!,"I bought this TV 20 months ago, and above all mentioned sync problems, I just faced another problem, which made me come over here and leave a comment. My TV is not working anymore!! When you turn it on, you only hear the sound without any picture comin up! Just some blue and red pictures coming for a while and the screen gets black!I called the manufacturer and they told me it will cost $400-$450 to repair it! I am going to but a new TV, but it will never ever gonna be a Westinghouse!Strongly NOT RECOMMENDED!"
2,Just not for me,"The overall positive reviews of this Probar flavor encouraged me so I mistakenly set high expectations. I almost bought an entire box but held off until my local WF restocked their supply so I could sample one. I bought one this week and ate it after two hours of exercise last night. All I can say is ""Yuck."" It took away my hunger but I found the tastes and textures to be overly gritty, heavy, and disappointing."
5,Tasty AND Healthy!,"The first time I tried a Probar Superfood Slam I Ipaid at least $4.00 for 1 bar. The colorful packaging caught my eye. What was INSIDE the package was really good. Raw/Organic ingredients, Low Sodium, Good Protein, and Chocolate chips! I usually eat breakfast on the run, and this is what I grab. I don't have time in the morning to make breakfast so these are PERFECT. The price on Amazon is a Really Good Deal, it would cost a lot to buy them at a store, IF you can even find them."
5,Delicious,"This flavor is fantastic. Really, don't be put off by the green color -- I know I'm not; you can't taste it at all and it just serves as a reminder of the great nutritional value of this product. If you love the idea of whole, organic food nutrition and enjoy a sweet, dense flavor with nuts and seeds, this is the one for you. There are lots of flax seeds, whole almonds, and delectable giant chocolate chips throughout. Remember, though, it's quite large because it's intended as a meal replacement, not a snack bar (unless you break it up)."
5,Snack Food,"Probar is a sweet, nutty, highly satisfying snack, I can carry with me anywhere. Only ONE Weight Watcher point."
1,"The Thesis is Not Only Wrong, It Is Offensive","The Poles were not treated well by the Germans. That much is obvious. But to compare their treatment to that of the Jews . . . this author is interested in making a name for himself by ""exposing"" a new Holocaust. It is wrong to try to get famous by being dishonest about genocide. After conquering the majority of Continental Europe, the Nazis developed a hierarchy among their slave laborers: Poles were at the top. Then came Ostarbeiters who were treated much worse than Poles. Then far below the Ostarbeiters were the Jews. The Jews of Poland are gone now. Polish anti-semitism is not."
4,A good study resource,"I took the GMAT without studying at all years ago and scored in the upper 80s. Had I used this studyguide, I'm sure I could have cracked the 90s. This study guide provides a wealth of knowledge about how the GMAT is scored, as well as strategies to taking the test and how to approach different kinds of problems. The only down-side is that the only way you can get official GMAT questions is by buying the office GMAT book. Also, this book seems to be geared towards the middle of the road test-takers, making large portions of it not very helpful if you are already a decent test taker."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","Well, after all the glowing reviews for this book, I was sure that I would love it. I found the beginning boring and tedious, but that has happened before in books that do get interesting after giving them 50 pages or so. So I kept reading, figuring it would get better, but after around 85 pages I found myself not even wanting to pick up the book. It was SO boring--uninteresting characters, boring repetitious conversations. Maybe if I gave it 200 pages it would get interesting, but there are far too many books out there that are interesting from the very beginning for me to waste any more time on this one!"
3,Works in my CX5400 but...,"This product did not arrive in an OEM package, although it does have a blue Epson label on it. It came in a generic white bubble envelope. I also see where the listing does not state NEW, new old stock (expired), or REFILLED, so I really don't know which it is. I installed it in my printer and it does work. So basically if it lasts as long as it should, I will buy another. If it doesn't, then I won't. It would be great if the listing on Amazon would spell out NEW, NOS, or REFILL."
3,"Product Fine, Delivery not good","The product was exactly as I expected. However, while I did elect to use the free shipping, there was no indication that there would be a delay in starting the shipment. Glad I was not in a hurry for the ink!"
1,These color cartriges do not work in my CX5400!!!,"I bought this pack thru Amazon and after installing them in my CX5400 I got an error message on the printer saying there was a problem with the cartridges. I took out what I had just installed and found them to be TO3...series when my CX5400 takes a TO42...series. I now have three openned, new, but, unusable cartridges. Anyone want them?"
5,Black Ink,Easy to useordering was very simple and pricing was rightI would reccomend this Ink and this company to anyone
5,Motherhood Exposed is funny even without kids!,"Katherine Grace's Motherhood Exposed is hilarious. A friend of mine recommended it, and at first I saw no reason to read it since I do not have children. Nevertheless, I did read it, and laughed all the way thru it. The author has a marvelously humorous way of discussing important parent/child relationships. But don't think that simply because the book is humorous it has nothing solid to say about parenting. Even without kids, I can clearly see Katherine Grace's wisdom in dealing with her children. All can profit from her wisdom. I am happy to recommend this book."
2,"Even if true, (and a big IF) it could have been told better.","In the past five years I must have read 50 books on aliens, abductions, crop circles, etc. While not an expert, I do feel that my in-depth reading has given me the ability to separate the good from the bad, and this I would have to say is bad. I agree with the reviewer above regarding birth rates, and furthermore think that the whole book is undercut even more by the last section which states that this alien race has found the exact location of Heaven in space! If they are that advanced, why do they need this big orchestrated arrival plan? Why not just zap us all into a better more spiritual consciousness? And why now? Why not before W.W.II or Vietnam? Why not before the pandemic of AIDS? (This particularly since they are supposed to be a sexually liberated species). The fact that Krapf claims to have had total recall for the telling of this book makes me think they must not have said much if this is all he could remember to write."
2,He should have researched the real thing more first,"This book would have been more believable had the author bothered to first check into more serious and credible books on the subject before composing this. As a person who has studied the subject my whole life (though I'm just 25) there were plenty of sore thumbs that gave this story away for what it is, a story. The ironic thing is that perhaps more people in the mainstream will now give at least a moment of thought to this very real and important issue, but it is also unfortunate because it could be damaging to the authentic individuals exploring this subject. My mom pointed out that the author's name is likely a pen name, and you can tell for yourself what it sounds like. I would wait to buy the book until the ""new city"" appears in the desert. Jesse"
5,Hands down the best auto racing book I've seen,"I've been around this sport my whole life, and I've eagerly snatched up and read every book on the sport I could find.And out of all of those, this book is without a doubt the best. Curtis Turner had a life that would take 4 Hollywood films to document. It was complex, it was wild, it was, in a word, unbelievable. Edelstein's book was 5 years in the making. It was painstakingly researched, and was very, very well written. Edelstein puts the reader in the race car with Turner, as well as in the seat next to him aboard his Aero Commander, where Curtis was equally as fearless. From the highs, such as his 1956 Southern 500 victory, to the lows, such as the ultimate betrayal of a business partner that lost him his beloved Charlotte Motor Speedway, the book continues to work at a professional, even keel.It's not a book about racing. It's a book about a legend. It was long overdue. Thank you, Mr. Edelstein, for finally bringing Curtis Turner back to life."
5,A survey of Turner's legendary life and many achievements,"Fans of car racing in general and NASCAR in particular won't want to miss Robert Edelstein's biography of driver Curtis Turner in Full Throttle: The Life And Fast Times Of Nascar Legend Curtis Turner. Racing fans receive a fast page-turner about one of the most dynamic stock car racers in history. Access to the files of Turner's widow supplement motorsports writer Robert Edelstein's fascinating coverage, adding depth to his survey of Turner's legendary life and many achievements."
5,My shower stool,This chair is just wonderful for a bathtub as well as a shower. It is sturdy and adjustable as to height.Fine product.
2,Duro-Med Shower Tub Stool,"Unfortunately, the stool arrived in its box without the seat. As we needed one quickly, we purchased a similar stool locally. We returned the stool and Amazon was quick to give us a refund. The manufacturer who sent these out evidently needs some quality control."
1,Functional but it rusts.,"We got this stool because I needed to sit and shower while recovering from foot surgery. Our tub is not wide enough for a rectangular bench. The stool is sturdy, safe, comfortable, excellent in every way except for the fact that brown water leaks out of the drain holes in the legs. We expected the stool to be rust free, rust is not good on tub surface or bath mats. Would not buy again."
1,something was wrong with the way the legs were made,the legs did not fit together i had to send it back sorry i was refunded soemthing was wrong with the grooves and they would not fit together
5,Great shocks,"Put these on my daughters 2001 Corolla CE, You need to know what you are doing and have the correct tools to install these shocks!! If you have a spring compressor and know how to bleed brake lines you will be good to go (I had a AST Certified Mechanic helping me with access to the Toyota manual). The most challenging part was figuring out how to remove the back seat to get to the top on the shocks, the rest was straight forward removal and install."
1,Didn't fit like they claimed,The color was the best thing about this product.It did not fit as stated for my specific Rhino.The design was not accurate for the suggested model.
3,Just basic stuff...ok for a starter,"Even though there's only 1 plan, you do learn what some specific needs of some specific birds are. You can buy simple kits to assemble at houses4birds.com"
3,not what you would expect,"I got this book thinking that it would help me with my virago. Only with great pain did I find what I was looking for. The index doesn't match the contents of the book ie look up starter clutch and the pages take you to connecting rods. All over the book it says to refer to chapter ten on how to properly bleed the breaks, only it's not in the book!!! I will use this book till I get one from someone else and then use it for starting the fireplace."
5,college student perspective,"Chadwick's study on the Secularization of the European mind in the 19th century is an exceptionally well-written and intensely studied analysis of a vast topic. He does an excellent job of disproving many erred historical theories. The alternative theories he offers are typically well supported; however, some are based on unsound assumption and unfounded generalizations. Perhaps the most noted is his downplaying of the influence of Darwinism. Overall this book is very good and is recommended for anyone interested in the subject. It is not bathroom reading."
3,Small is small,"I bought these gloves to help my hands while exercising with kettlebells. The small was too short and tight. The gloves also aren't padded in the wrist area, so I guess they are intended for weight training. They would be a good value in the right size for that."
4,Book has no info on porcelain boxes,Although this book covers makers marks and has beautiful photos it is not recommended for those seeking info on porcelain hinged boxes. The book is for plates and such.
3,A critic,"Let's be honest, Gaston has had the only book on the market on the subject of LIMOGES until the last couple of years. This book was obviously an attempt by the publishers to capitalize on the Limoges collector market and to publish anything on the subject. Gaston has just pushed out books - and collecting should be taken seriously. I can not recommend this book."
3,"Kindle version needs work, but content is good","I've just started reading this book after a strong recommendation from a friend. So far the content is good, but the conversion to kindle is sloppy. Formatting seems off and there are heaps of new lines in the wrong areas.Also the book, as stated, seems to often be geared towards men in stable (although admittedly boring) relationships. I'll update my review once I get further into it, but seriously they should update the kindle version and correct the typos and formatting issues."
4,May be exactly what you need - a new perspective,"I threw this into my cart when it was recommended with Art of Manliness since the price was good and I had a gift card. It's a quick read, and I have to say that I agree with 99% of what is in the book, and I've experienced how all of these techniques really do work in life and even picked up a couple of things. More importantly though, I gave this to a friend who I had thought of, and he phoned me the other day to say that it has changed his life and corrected a whole bunch of ""incorrect thinking"" on his part. He sees a great way forward and is already thinking about other guys he needs to share this with. For anyone who thinks these books are about being a macho jerk, they aren't - they are about getting back your confidence and strength so you can be the husband/dad that your family really wants you to be for them. Great book."
5,Good Value,"I have used this product for my computer monitor (22inch) for around 7 months. The mounting screws that came with the product are cheap and were not used, I went down to the hardware store and bought some nice heavy duty ones. Overall for the price of this, it can't be beat. The allen adjustment screws are a little on the cheaper side, but do function well for the price, I have it mounted on the wall just a bit sideways and they seem to have held up well in time."
2,OK for self-hypno.....,"This book is so-so. I've seen many more ""Idiot's Guides"" that were far more useful for their intended purpose. This book will give the reader a sufficient explanation of what hypnosis is all about, enough so to allay any fears one might have. The most in-depth portion of the book is self-hypnosis...but even for that, there are plenty more books and CDs available that do a better job. This book is sorely lacking in anything close to telling how to perform hypno. It's a rather long-winded book and is lacking in actual useful scripting or techniques."
3,Try it,"Madison Morrison does not provide easy access for his readers. In Engendering he shifts between observations of everyday life in Norman, Oklahoma, and excerpts from ancient Chinese scriptures.If you need to try something completely different - try this. I found it an interesting read, most of all because it is like nothing else.If you're satisfied with Harry Potter and Bridget Jones's Diary and never need something to challenge the reader in you, this is not for you.The book is part of Madison Morrisons project 'The Sentence of the Gods'."
5,EXCELLENT IS WHAT I CALL THIS PRODUCT,"I bought this to make my own vanilla extract, I added three (3) vanilla beans to one (1) cup of vodka, I let it stayed two weeks before using it in cakes I made and was happy the flavour is by far better than the one you buy at any store, and the longer you keep it the better it gets"
5,Airbrush,A friend told me about this airbrush so I decided to order one. It looks great and works just great.
2,"Superman, Spiderman, Batman in one. Should have rented not purchased this movie","What I haven noticed is that HR exploits his son's looks in his movies. Not bad looking but not the best in Bollywood. This movie is okay at the beginning, but then turns boring watching him smiling and posing and showing off his body and hair. Tooo long of a movie. This movie is a combination of Superman, Batman, Spiderman and The Black Mask. Don't know why I purchased this movie, should have rented."
3,Series continues to improve.,"Colleen Doran, A Distant Soil III: The Aria (Image, 2001)A Distant Soil gets better as it gets older. The focus which was notably absent from the first book has gradually appeared, and the characters are getting more complex as time goes on. If you managed to forgive the first volume its errors of judgment, continuing on with the story of Jason and Liana is warranted.In this episode, Jason, who's been brainwashed by the resistance, is about to kill Seren, the avatar, as we open-- except that Seren is also Rieken, the head of the resistance, and... oh, why bother? It's like trying to describe the plot of a soap opera. (In fact, it IS describing the plot of a soap opera.) Read the first two, you'll get up to speed. This one's a decent continuation of what came before. At this rate, Book Four, when it finally comes out, will be the best graphic novel of the year. ***"
5,Exactly what I needed for my class.,"I bought this book for one of my HP classes for school. The price was generous compared to bookstores around the campus. The hardback cover was somewhat coming apart but, not enough where the pages were falling out of the binding, that's why I did'nt go down to 4 starts. I would recommend this to buyers who are looking for a good reference in learning about how the human body performs and the learning to perform."
3,Too much nudity for a children's book!,"I got this book to read with my children. My husband spent over an hour putting clothes on all the people throughout the book. I'm not impressed with the illustrations. We can understand the history without all the nudity. I don't want to expose my kids to soft porn. It is written well, but if you decide to get it for your children to view, I would suggest a black sharper to add clothing, then the book is great!"
5,Great,Love Usborne books for their pictures and in-depth information. We use this along with Kingfisher's to supplement our History. Great!
3,World History Book,"We are a Christian homeschooling family and are using this book along with the Kingfisher equivalent as a part of our world history schedule this year. There are lots of great pictures in this book but unfortunately there is a lot of nudity. I understand cultural differences, etc but when a book is written for children and the people did have clothes because half of the other people on the page are dressed, why not just make them all dressed? Not a big deal though, I just took my marker and made little clothes for all of the unnecessary nudity.Other than that, the book holds the attention of my active boys and makes for a great short but meaty lesson for History."
3,A pretty basic history,"Got a recommendation from a third party. I was surprised to find it's almost set up more like a comic book than the textbooks I remember. Probably suitable for 1st to maybe 3rd grade, or if your kids have difficulty reading.I was mildly impressed that they didn't shy away from depicting the every-day nudity that has taken place in most of the World's history. I've never seen that in a kid's book before, and I give it kudos for showing that today's standards haven't always been the norm."
3,Like this Games,"I'm Sorry it took me so long to write a Review for this Game. I liked it, it is Fun, I was hoping there was more to it. I will Buy From this Seller again, But I will make sure That I am Buying more of a game then just one."
1,resold it to listia person,did not work on my computer and did not work on my old computerdid not geve out much info
5,classical western music,I like the CD. Its a good western classical music theme. I also like the DVD. It's one of my favorite Charles Bronson movies.
2,Great effort but not without errors,"I know how difficult it is to transcribe the equivocal voicings of Bill Evans' chords, particularly the left hand. Mostly the book is a painstaking and an accurate transcription ,but not always. There are some mistakes (accidentals missing), and an impenetrable Cm11 voicing in one piece, while the LH chord in part of ""I should Care"" is one inversion too low (I should Care - ""Funny how sheep can send you to sleep""). This last is an example of how fond Bill was of the semitone buzz. I think he preferred voicings for G7 like (going up from just below middle C) B E F A (which is of course G9,13 really) to F A B E (a tritone lower)"
2,not good,English lanquage is underrepresented.Word crime is nothere but we have criminal law.I expect on word crimeto see crime rates in the world and where USA is.Word hunger not here either but we see hunger strike.Encyclopedia not suppose to hide anything.
1,Unreliable information-another sign in the decline of information and editing?,"Just wanted to look up a simple fact-the arab population of Hatay. I found this in the entry on Hatay: ""The population is predominantly Arab but includes many Christians.""This statement equates Arab with non-christian. It totally confuses a religious identity with a linguistic and ethnic one. One would conclude from it that the Christians in Hatay are not Arabs.Arabs can be Christian, Muslim, Druze, Chaldean, Atheist...How do I know? Because a good friend of mine is an Arab Christian from Syria.Allowing such a simple error makes me doubt the veracity of the information throughout. Where are the editors? Boo, hiss."
2,Great Book and Great Online tool,"My DVD did not work. I was given the run around by tech support. Once you start the online portion-- you will have a year to complete it. After which, you will no longer have access. Take good notes-- I really enjoyed the online portion. I'm really upset by the DVD because the book alone would have been a lot cheaper..."
2,Some errors in quantitive questions,"This is book is not worth your time. The test strategy is so so.The most problematic with this book is I found some errors in the quantitive sections (so far). There are times I cannot get the right answers ,and it turns out there are misprints."
3,"Good for Math, not for Verbal","I used both PR book as well as the GMAC book.The PR book gave a quick math review but nothing in depth. Additionally, I practiced the verbal portion quite extensively using their methodology and scored VERY well on the practice within their book...without even peaking at the answers :o)So, going into the test (for the 2nd time) I anticipated that I would do much better on the Verbal this time around...this was not the case as I actually managed to lower my Verbal score.The Analytical Writing Review was good. 1st time I scored 4.5 and this tiem 5.5. Though, I can sum that up for you....write A LOT.I did well on my math the first time as well but this book helped me improve my score by 20 points. I'd recommend reviewing both books without taking them too seriously, it's much different on the computer so download the free software and practice those.GOOD LUCK!"
2,Looks nice. Fades fast.,"When I got the necklace it was nice. 2 weeks later and one shower with it and the gold came right off, the pendent and chain faded.Looks cool but its cheap."
2,Molon Labe,"I'm waiting for the playmobil mexican drug cartel set! It comes complete with ransom note, bale of marijuana and the victims come with both heads and headless bodies. Wonderful toy for kids. Let's them see their future. But the security set is good for teaching your kids about how America is not free anymore, ESPECIALLY when there is a toy that proves it!The durability of this item amazed me when I chucked the whole effing thing against the wall of my house and nothing broke. I guess the chinese are getting pretty good at making things!MOLON LABE!"
1,No body cavity?,"Not only are there no latex breasts under which to stash my miniature balloon bag, there are no body cavities in which to teach my child to hide illegal contraband such as a 4 ounce bottle of mouthwash. I was thoroughly disappointed that there was no upgrade feature wherein the figure could be demoralized in an xray booth. If this company wants to provide accurate products then the toy figures would also be mildly over weight. A second head could be included so that when the figure steps into the xray box so that they can be de-clothed by a stranger/s and possibly someone they know, then a more accurate expression could be rendered. One of embarrassment and realization that there is nothing that you can do to protect your dignity in a country run by fascist power-hungry war lords."
4,The only thing that this is missing and why it only got 4 stars...,"I can only give this version 4 out of 5 stars. The Deluxe Edition received a full 5 stars however, because it included the anal probes, the junk racker, children in diapers and grandma in a wheelchair in diapers. It also had a separate gate where the included Shieks could walk through without having to pass through security.My advice is spend the extra $2000 and find the deluxe edition."
5,Sokay,"This TOY IS GREAT! But there are some things that should be added make it more realistic. I'd like to see some diversity in one of the guards and perhaps the other guard could have some drool dripping from it's lip to reflect the extremely low IQ needed to obtain this type of position. Also, add a 80 year old woman with (remove able clothes so she may be stripped searched) and a 20 something middle eastern looking man. (no need to make his clothes remove able as we are going for realism)"
1,Thumbs Down,"While most of the comments here have been satirical, and very entertaining, I find it absolutely pathetic there is even a product like this on the market. This is without a doubt one of the most vile displays of social engineering I have ever come across. My issue is not with Amazon, they are only highlighting a product on the market, but the engineer of this propaganada tool. The sad part is the rating area should not be ""educational value"", but ""re-educational value""."
1,Get acclimated to tyranny!,"Wanna teach your kids history of check points and police state fun? Teach them not about World War 2 Germany, but teach them about stassi America today!My kids are sure to absolutely love this little outfit. Too bad they don't have these for grown ups. We could all really use the practice of being shuttled around as sheep!"
1,Do you really think.......?,"Not my idea of a ""toy"". Why do you want our children to become comfortable with airport security checks? It's obvious that this is meant to send a message to the little ones of what's to come."
1,This is obscene,"This is obscene. It is also an act of desperation. They know, but won't admit, that they've ruined themselves and have no future."
1,Boycott Playmobil,Do not indoctrinate children into a culture where being fondled by TSA agents is OK. I'm ashamed of the folks at Playmobil and will never buy another product from them because of this toy.
1,Sick,Conditioning children to believe in the myth of the legitimacy of state authority is sick and evil.
2,"Cheap, but...cheap","If you're looking for an inexpensive and compact desktop system, this is it.However...Five months after we got ours, it spontaneously stopped recognizing the wireless USB device we added on. Repeated attempts to get it to work failed. We asked for an exchange, but were refused. After repair analysis, it was discovered that the USB support was incompatible with a new HR Printer I'd bought (the Laserjet 1020). I cannot use the printer with the computer!It's embarassing that an HP computer won't work with an HP printer. I would recommend something more reliable and ""bulletproof"" than this."
2,Socialism disguised,"Dumb ideas like this are brought forward again and again. Of course, inevitably, it will result in central social planning -- see, for instance, Hayek's Road to Serfdom to understand why.Workers will be paid by hardship instead of value produced?! Hilarious. So the jobs that produce the most value, i.e., the most important jobs, will go unfilled!It's amazing anyone would take nonsense like this seriously."
3,Literature or Research?,"If you are new on the Maya path, you will find this book very interesting, easy to read and capturing. But, if you are a mayanist aficionado, better try another book, like Montgomery's, about Mayan writing, of David Drew's account of it. Coe, even when he made important apportations to mayan studies, is one of that scholars (like Thompson, his nemesis) that put the personal view on his research. So, this account is full of biased information and emotional catarsis. However, it is very readable, keeping you reading until the end, like a good mistery or detective story. Enjoy the reading, but if you want something serious, he is not the guy."
1,Do not buy if you have finerglass,"I bought one of these. Will not stick to a fiberglass tub surround safely. May be ok on tile or glass, I don't know, bit I would not purchase this again. It appeared to stick at first but after 10 mins crashed. Glad I didn't have a bird on it."
1,Very bad product,"I got this ""Polly Pet Products Window or Shower Bird Perch"" for about two weeks now. OMG, it is the most horrible product I've purchased for my bird. It would not stick on the bathroom wall for too long. It keeps falling off in the middle of the shower and scares my Timneh African Grey badly. He used to love showering - dancing, fluffing his feathers, and shaking his wings under the running water. However, after 3 times of falling off this perch, he will not go into the shower any more. Now, he would scream loudly and flying frantically around the bathroom every time I take him in there. Please think about the negative effect this product will have on your bird before deciding to buy it."
5,Old School Action!!!,"This is how action movies need to made and used to made. There is nothing like seeing 6 heroes going up against 200 and not being scratched. This is an action movie and nothing more. There is a story in there facilitating the reason for the action, but who cares!?! Its all about the bullets flying and the explosions to begin with."
4,GOOD FUN WITH A SURPRISE APPEARANCE INCLUDED,An over the top action film that delivers for those who like this particular genre. An impressive list of actors portray various mercenary roles (as well as others who are connected to them) who are set on freeing an island nation from the nefarious claims of an American industrialist and his puppet dictator. This is good fun with some funny lines but also some cheesy ones. If you don't like the new direction of action films this isn't for you because there are a lot of tongue in cheek moments where you can tell various actors and behind the scenes types were having their fun. Old School soundtrack. Surprise appearance included.CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOT POINTS: B minus; GETTING SUCH A CAST TOGETHER (very hard): A minus; WHEN WATCHED: 11/30/2010; MY GRADE: B to B plus (for the particular genre).
2,Sly and the Family Retro,"""The Expendables"" (2010) should have been mindless ""B-movie"" fun. Unfortunately, Sylvester Stallone torpedoes the star-studded enterprise with his turgid script and plodding direction. ""Rambo"" was no masterpiece, yet Stallone kept things moving. Apart from a few impressive action scenes, nothing clicks here - even the brief summit meeting of Sly, Arnold and Bruce falls flat. Better luck next time."
2,wasn't what i expected,mmm i didnt even finish the movie because i fell asleep to it. Not as much action as i thought there would be
3,The Expendables - DVD,"a good action movie that doesn't require a lot of thinking, if any. i suppose having the huge cast of stars was a good thing in the end. not too long or short."
3,get the whole gang together,"action squences pretty good.this another of the lets give the old gang. some screen time. the only thing this needed was stallone in his rambo outfit, schwartzenager in aconan breech cloth, and strathom driving everybody in a mercedes!"
2,Not bad.,"My father found this movie to be fairly amusing. I personally did not find the appeal. There was simply the nostalgia aspect based on its cast. I don't see myself watching it more than once, but it was decent either way."
4,Lot Of Action,Plenty of action with realistic plot. Lovable characters. Should have been based in the middle east instead of South America.
4,Better than I expected!,"I hold up on seeing this movie because I thought it was just a whole bunch of old action movie stars doing their things. I mean, you see one and you see them all. I am not a fan of the Statham guy either. I watched it and it was funny and not cheesy at all. I can't believe Bruce Willis and Arnold S. were in the movie for just a couple of minutes! Anyways, I think I may even rent the sequel! Mickey Rourke has GOT to be the sexiest man on earth!"
4,Expendables is a Keeper for Action Fans,"Not a great film but I really liked the homage to Action Heroes of the likes portrayed in""The Magnificent Seven, The Dirty Dozen,The Wild Bunch...."". The movie is great fun. The castingis spot on and is well balanced. The actors played their roles well and comfortably. I likedit well enough that I bought it. I had already seen it on the Big Screen and now it is partof my movie collection. I would like to see another by the same bunch of guys. Amazon makesit so quick and easy."
5,I loved this movie!,"I first saw this movie on Dish VOD in high def and loved it! So the first place I came was amazon to buy it in blu ray! When I first heard of this movie I was not sure what to think, and if it was not for my husband; I probably would not have ever rented it. I was so wrong! This movie is just fun from the start to the end. It was great to see all these actors together that I grew up loving. Mickey Rourke's character is fabulous in this movie. I cannot tell you how many times this movie made me laugh out loud. Yea the action and adventure is out there....unbelievable, maybe even a little superhuman . . . but isn't that what made these guys famous to begin with? They are all still looking pretty darn good to me. LOL I loved it and I am happy to now own it on blu ray."
3,The Expendables,"I like movies that I can escape from the real world for a few hours. The Expendables was a great waste of time, had no redeeming features and was enjoyable to watch. What more can you ask for from a movie."
3,The REAL Expendables...,"...are not the raggedy soldiers of fortune lead by Sylvester Stallone in last summer's action hit, but rather the standard dvd and ""bonus"" digital copy foisted upon consumers to ante up the price for this movie. If I wanted a STANDARD definition dvd of this I wouldn't buy the BLU-RAY."
1,Don't buy digital copy on iTunes to get it.,"Don't buy, the digital is on iTunes not on a disc like other dvd sets, you must use iTunes to get your copy. I don't use apple software on my PC. Don't buy this set."
1,Don't. Watch. This. Movie.,"I'd add more if I thought it was worth it. But it's not. There is no plot. And the action? Not enough to cover up the lack of plot. The acting, dialogue and plot was totally unbelievable, and not in a good way.Oh sure, I thought that all of these action stars (two or three of which aren't big enough deals to tango with the rest) in an effort to recreate an old action movie would have been a GREAT movie. I was freakin' excited to see this. I thought it'd be a great summer movie, something for a great group of guys/friends to see together.This was not the case.Please. If you value good movies, don't see it. The confusion in Inception was more bearable than this insult of cinematography."
1,Testosterone much!?,"Seriously!? Come on people! Isn't there better ways to spend millions of dollars? I mean what a mindless killing spree! There is nothing about this movie that stood out or was anything I haven't seen before. The story line... I'm sorry what story line!? This is the crap you get when a washed up actor directs, produces, and is the lead of a movie. You get a high priced piece of CRAP! I'm so very happy that I only paid […] for this thing and didn't waste my time or money on it in the theater. Sorry for those of you who did waste their time and money! If you want a mostly action, no boobs, and no acting movie, then this is PERFECT for you! If you want some loud noises to drown out your roommate and his girl then this movie is PERFECT! If you like a story, decent acting, and well just a good movie then just SKIP this one."
1,Zero Stars Actually,"Aside from Statham, this movie is unwatchable. I'm an action movie fan and certainly don't expect great dialogue or acting in this type of movie, but this one hits a new low. If you like Stallone in Cobra, then you might like this movie too - otherwise, stay far away from this one - absolutely terrible!"
5,All I have to say is WHOA!,"This movie is the action flick of the year, why because all the great action guys are in it! Stallone, Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, UFC monster Randy Couture and even Terry Cruze (The big fatherdude from Everybody Hates Chris) Even Bruce Willis and the great ""Awnold"" make an appearance. This movie is crazy, the fight scenes are so good you'll be backtracking just trying to figure out what happened! I hear talk of Expendables 2 next years and I can't wait!"
2,Awful,"I like movies. I watch a lot of 'em, and even most of the ones I don't like I watch all the way through. I can suspend disbelief at the drop of a hat, so I guess I enjoy more movies than many.Well, I watched all of this one, kinda hoping for some glimmer of redeeming value . . . y'know, something to make the story vaguely believable, or any of the characters a tiny bit likeable. Never happened. The story was awful, most of the acting was awful . . . or, maybe it's just that Stallone's speech has become nearly as slurred and incomprehensible as it was in the first Rocky movie. No amount of MTV editing could rescue the action sequences. The less said about Micky Rourke, the better.Simply put, it wasn't over the top enough to be funny, but too serious about its gritty realism to suspend disbelief and have a good time.It's painful to admit, but Giselle Itié and Charisma Carpenter were the most believable characters in the movie.Don't waste your time."
4,B grade movie filled with B grade actors,I actually liked the movie though it's not the greatest thing ever made. I'm a Stallone fan and give him credit for making action films at his age. The original Rocky and Rambo will never be beat though.
3,Nostalgic Action,Good action and lots of bravado in a movie that qualifies as good entertainment for a home watching experience. Overall; ok
2,lots of booms and bangs,"Not very good. I like each of the actors, but the collective chemistry just wasn't that good. I like action films, but this didn't measure up."
1,A STINKER!,It is unfortunate that this movie is like watching all star wrestling. No plot. No suspense. No thrill. Poor acting. Great music and great special effects. This movie will appeal to 12 to 18 year old males with a very low IQ. If you watch it as an extemely violent comedy you may get a twisted thrill from this junk.
2,Thumbs Down,4 out of the 5 of us fell asleep half way thru. Reminded me of watching my teenage boys playing Call of Duty or some other fighting video game. Fake background really noticable...not sure if it was our new 240 hz hd tv or what.
4,Action Galore,"Do you like non-stop action?Do you like special effects?Do you like total and utter destruction?If you answered yes to every question above and you are not squeamish about violence, fasten your seatbelt and enjoy the ride!Fortunately the plot is so simple that there is no need to waste any brain cells to follow it. Towards the end you would think that the special effects crew went nuts. What the heck were they thinking (or smoking)?Also check out the 'gag reel' and the 'making of' in the extras. It gives you another perspective about this movie and more respect for Sylvester Stallone who was the writer/director/actor.I enjoyed it, but it is probably not for everybody."
5,ALL BUSINESS FRONT AND CENTER!!!,"This movie doesnt make any apologies for not being a ""Bourne Ultimatum"" or a ""Matrix"" type of movie. But what it does have is wall to wall action,and its very well done. It certainly is realistic enough not to be a movie where one guy walks into town and turns into a one man wrecking crew! It shows what a team can do together, and it tons better than the ""A Team"" movie was earlier this year. As of this writing, Stallone and Lungren were cruising the scenery in Mexico for a sequel to be released late next year.These guys really earn their money in this movie. The action scenes are incredible especially when Stallone and Statham , after escaping from a battalion of mercenaries, destroys a pier along with a couple dozen of those bad guys. Pretty ingenious from the air in fact. Incredible!! As with most action movies, the dialogue is a little better than the average action movie. I highly recommend this movie, and I cant wait for the sequel."
4,The Expendables,"This a gift and I haven't seen, but I do like the actors and the storyline.hope to see it soon."
1,Only Watched 10 Minutes,Only watched the first 10 minutes and that was enough gore for me. Thought it might be a little more entertaining; but it is just another guts and blood movie.
4,Good,"Now Im not exactly a huge stallone fan but this was pretty good. I have to admit hat I was waiting for the headband to come in though. Very good collection of action characters and decent for a low budget film. Good thing about low budget though, limited cg! So lots of actual explosions!"
5,Cool Movie!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my father who is a huge action movie guy, and he loved it!"
1,The title says it all.,Expendable.Yep. Sly Stallone tries to resurrect his career and brings his aging mates with him. Dolph Lundgren finally gets his apology for Rocky by betraying and then being redeemed.Can't get this two hours back.
3,Heavy action,"Hyper-paced action will keep you fixated throughout. An aging Arnold makes a cameo appearance. Bruce Willis' does little more than cheapen the movie with a spew of junior high locker room talk. Fortunately, his role is brief."
1,No Script - No Movie,"Obviously Stalone knows how to both write a script, and make a movie. My God look at Rocky, Rambo, and a few other mega hits that he both wrote and directed. So what was the problem with the Expendables? No plot line, no acting, no story, no nothing. Why? Who knows I mean he had every super star action hero in the world. It happens when you gather enough talent to kid yourself into the delusion that you can make a movie without a script. SORRY IT DON'T WORK THAT WAY. Loss $400,000,000 not to mention his fading Hollywood capatil. Don't waste your time, money, or sanity. SKIP THIS ONE..."
1,The Expendables,"Although I purchased this DVD as used, it was indicated to be in ""excellent"" condition. It was not. My husband watched most of the movie and then the screen went blank. I've never had this happen before when purchasing a used DVD. Needless to say, I will not be purchasing used DVD's from this vendor again through Amazon. They should not be endorsed through Amazon either."
1,Wow,"Wow...I went into this movie expecting a thin plot and some fun explosions. All I got was explosions.With the exception of one scene with Mickey Rourke, the whole thing was a waste of time and money. It felt like they didn't even try to work on a convincing story."
2,Great movie but didn't work on my Euro PS3,"I bought this movie and was so excited to see it again, but the surprise was huge when I put the movie on my Euro (PAL) Playstation 3. Movie didn't work at all on my PS3, because the region zone was different. I was able to see digital copy on my PC but it's picture and sound quality was horrible. I bought this version for HD sound and picture quality. Movie itself will get 5 stars! I hate these regional zones."
2,Don't waste your money.,"Very disappointing for $120. Just get the papers and buy T. Lee's book instead, especially if you're designing in CMOS. This brief book seems to be basically a collection of information gathered from ISSCC/JSSC papers. There was a surprising lack of subject matter here, although good basic information on RF is included in the text, but you could easily find the information elsewhere."
3,Do the batteries ever die?,"I listen to this radio regularly, often several hours a day, and don't think I've replaced the batteries twice in 2 years. All said, a great radio, the AM and FM reception is great, although I've found the shortwave reception to be so-so, the caveat being I live in the city. While camping, I tend to pick up far more channels, albeit fewer than I've managed with other radios.One wildly annoying aspect is the radio's backlight: it is timed, perhaps 20 seconds. Therefore if you're fumbling with it in the dark (as I regularly do while camping), you need to keep one hand close to the backlight button in order to continually press it.All said a great radio, although I'm evaluating others as looking for a truly killer shortwave device."
1,"Junk, pure junk","The tablet PC is junk. Just over a year old, and it's been into the shop 3 times. It is sitting here now and i cannot get into the PC because it went to ""sleep"" and no one seems to know how to get it to wake up. According to the ""tech support"" it is an easy process.HAHAI've tried the things they wanted me to, but it still isnt' working. They say send it into my local computer shop, but the 3 that i deal with won't touch it.JUNK, JUNK, JUNK...Do not buy."
3,Chipmunks - Great! This album - Eh....,"We all love the Chipmunks. Having one of their Xmas albums handy during the holiday season is a MUST! However, this is not the album to buy. There are lots of them floating around.I think there are really two Chipmunks Xmas songs which are THE classics: The Chipmunk Song (obviously) and their take on the Twelve Days of Christmas. Inexplicably, the 12 Days of Xmas is not on this album. So I would go back, find an album with both of these classics and buy that one."
2,NOT a long bill Cap,"Ordered two of these hats and they are well made and the colors are as advertised. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a long bill to give you extra sun protection as I was, this is not the cap."
1,THE UNSWEPT ROOM by Sharon Olds,"This is not poetry! It is the rantings of a woman obsessed with herself and her anguish. I don't care.Her verse is sexually explicit and offensive, in particular the poem titled ""Sunday Night"" in which she recounts the improper, what could even be considered the criminal behavior of her father towards the waitresses at the restaurants her family would frequent. What is worse, when this poem was written and published, her father was deceased, and unable to answer to these statements. I wonder if these behaviors actually took place, and, it not, why would the poet sully the name of her dead father? Also, what impact did this poem have on her mother? Perhaps Ms. Olds can write a poem to address these issues.I cannot recommend this dreadful ""poetry"" to anyone.Sincerely,Catherine Ross"
5,Great Program,"I just saw the great article in USA Today and that reminded me to write a review. This is a great beginner's program with some challenging moves that I look forward to being able to do. I know it's good because I can still feel it just a little bit the next day. Kristin's personality is engaging and not too perky. As a healthy but not very flexible guy, I'm very picky about my fitness DVDs, and I know this is a good one for both men and women."
4,Good toy...it's what my 6 year old and I expected.,It's a good toy. We received it within a couple weeks. My son loves it.
5,Brenda Ueland writes as she lived -- with gusto!,"Every line in Brenda Ueland's autobiography follows the powerful advice that the author gave in her wonderful book IF YOU WANT TO WRITE. She tells her story with absolute honesty and she always makes it interesting. It is impossible to read this book without being influenced. The reader begins to see life Brenda Ueland's way -- as a great, soaring adventure. This woman believed in everyone's talents and this is charmingly revealed in her depiction of herself with three children. When she asked who knew inside that he or she was really a genius -- all hands shot into the air, including her own. She makes the reader feel like one of the group."
3,"GREAT MOVIE, LOUSY MESSAGE","An excellent performance from all concerned in what is basically, in spite of its hype, a dark homophobic movie intended to make gays go back into the closet and bolt it from the inside. It concerns a serious of vicious attacks on gays in a particular neighborhood of London, presumably from real events. One is told that ""neighbors"" get together to fight back. Absolutely no such thing. Not one single attack is traced to its perpetrators. What one gets is a bunch of boring homophobic suburbanites having dinner while a gay boy gets murdered right outside. Kudos for having dared to expose the reality of sex between teens and adults. Many times, the teen is the aggressor, which was portrayed in the movie with chilling and heartbreaking accuracy. Wilby and Graves, of ""Maurice"" fame, are bit players in this one. Time has been kind to Graves, not Wilby. The movie belongs to the teen and his adult target. Real chemistry there! I like the movie, not the content."
1,"BORING, SLOW AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND","This was another British video, hard to understand with no subtitles, it was so Boeing I did not finish it. It was nothing but exploitation film, with gays being being beat up and pissed on.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
4,A gay version of Crash,This movie tied incorporated different story lines in a movie that will leaver all viewers wanting more. I recommend this to all.
2,Disappointing,"Being a fan of Astronomy, I bought this figuring it would be both educational and entertaining. At times, it was mildly entertaining, but I certainly didn't learn anything new. Some of the interviews were reasonably interesting, but the narration was rather boring and had a ""boilerplate"" feel to it. Actually, the whole series felt that way-like the general script was written, and they just filled in the blanks for each planet. After a while, I found myself fighting to stay awake. I think this is a good disc(s) for children, but not so much for adults.On my 60"" TV, the graphics were good, but nothing special. Again, at times seemed somewhat generic. This was particularly noticeable if you watched multiple episodes in a row."
3,Great ideas for self-promoting musicians,"Great ideas for starting your own publishing company, but the book is more focused on the song plugger. A better book for publishing company start-up is ""Start & Run Your Own Record Label,"" by Daylle Schwartz."
1,bad quality,I bought this item to break chocolate before tempering it .The chocolate that comes in 1 inch high at the first use the tooth of the fork bended . Now it is Unusable because .Also because I am living In south America I am not able to return it so trow the money to the trash.
4,Brilliant reading,"I bought this book for my 7 year old granddaughter. She just had to have a ""chapter book"" Since starting this book she has not been able to put it down. She was immediately transported into the world of Molly Moon. It is a very lively entertaining book that is easy to read for 7-10 year olds. I highly recomend this book"
3,Quality,I demand Made in America products if I can get them. The plastic reel is poorly made and was a bad idea I could cast some plastic and have a better piece than reel craft made. Reel craft is maximizing profit and sacrificing quality. Spend the extra money and get the metal reel.
4,Engaging British politico-dramedy,"A surprisingly engaging drama, by turns funny and wrenching, The Amazing Mrs Pritchard is very watchable. The first episode's light comedic tone rapidly gives way to a much harder-edged dramatic feeling as the stakes are raised from dark-horse candidate to overwhelmed Prime Minister with family problems -- it's not terribly realistic, but plenty of fun to watch. At six episodes, however, it feels somewhat incomplete. Recommended."
5,Mp390 printer-excellant,"I just love this printer and highly reccomend it, I do not understand why it is being discontinued."
3,No good for Mac,"It's fine for a Windows system, and it works OK via a print server, but there are no Mac drivers (I checked the Canon website too) for this big kluge, and that's unfortunate."
3,"I am not Happy, but may be what I got is an exception","I read all good reviews about Canon MultiPass MP390, but unfortunately the one I got in shipments works great for FAXES and does not do any other work.I guess the All in one Fax/Printer/Scanner I got is Defective. Any computer cannot detect this as a USB Printer. Tried out all combinations, Drivers from Internet, Product Cd etc. The USB port is defective and hence it cannot connect to computer. I have not been able to SCAN or Print even a single doc from Computer. So if you buy it make sure to check everything on Day One.Also it is flat bed so it is very cumbersome to scan docs one by one."
1,Cannon MP-390 multifunction printer,We had many problems trying get this unit to work with our desktop computer only to find out from the Canon tech support people many days later that it is not compatible with Windows 98. It corrupted our computer operating system so that it would not boot up or shut down properly and would lock up frequently. It also erased our desktop picture and some nice screen saver pictures. We never got it to work so returned it to Amazon.Walt
1,did not work right,The print did not work right from day one and still will not work even after going the canon web site and cleaning the head as per there support info. I tried several new print tanks and did not help. WalMart has sales going on today so this printer goes in the trash and i am getting a new one. Buying threw you or ebay is bad because of all the hassel to get things fixed. Buying at walmart or in town all i have to do is go to town and talk to them face to face and not write and wait for help that probley will not ever come plus and the time it takes.
2,Somewhat Interesting but Not a Must Read,"This book is perhaps more interesting in giving a little window into the lives of a small community of wealthy elite scholars in that era of Cambridge, with their summers climbing mountains and their academic reputations sometimes secured more by lineage than personal accomplishment.I was disappointed with this book mainly because there is a dearth of science in it, and the many characters in the book lack personality. In some ways it reads like a laundry list: So and so met so and so here and they did so and so."
3,Not in agreement...,"I bought this book because of the good reviews. There are a lot of books on C out there but I thought this one looked good. It isn't terrible but it certainly isn't as good as these reviews.Basically the explanations are all over the place. Nothing seems to have any order to it. The code from the very beginning has elements that aren't explained til much later in the book which gets confusing fast. This is barely a book for the beginner. Loops are explained well and in depth but other areas are very quickly passed over. There are some good points, like the fact that it explains C on Linux not just a general ANSI guide. This way you know how to compile your programs and what to use on Linux. I have learned some things from this book but it could have been organized much better."
2,Worked great for a few months,"I purchased the salt & pepper combo set in April 2010. In late September or early October, the salt mill stopped working despite several battery changes. There seems to be a problem with the button mechanism. The pepper mill still works great, but now I'm stuck in a dilemma as I'd prefer a matching set, yet I'm not sure I want to spend $65 for a 2nd salt mill theat may only work for a few months. I've searched the net & can't find any info on Peugeot repair centers."
4,A minor design flaw but well worth it.,"You need this left side support for your Bosch 4000-9 Jobsite Table Saw. Installation was very easy except I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I did wrong. I found out that the right side extension release handle, that came with the saw, wouldn't let the left extension sliding rod go fully into the closed position unless the right side extension handle is pulled up an inch or so. I like the left extension so I can live with the handle sticking out an inch and the lock still works. I can't believe Bosch let that design flaw go. I guess they knew we would still like the extension."
4,Makes ripping big boards easy.,"Worth the investment, but the same complaint I have with the rear outfeed, I wish it had two knobs to lock it down instead of one. Other than that it's fine."
2,Needs alignment help,"Bolts on easily. Thats where the good ends. At full extension, the support bar is 1/2"" low to the table. When push in, the front extension rod hits the right side table extension lever. No thumbscrews for locking it at extension or any position. Poor design. I emailed Bosch and they said that is the way it was designed. ?????? I redrilled the support bar to align it to the table, then I drilled the aluminum brackets for thumbscrews and it works acceptably."
5,Bosch TS 1003 table saw left side support extension,"As with both the rear and left side support extensions, the product exceeds my expectations. Like the saw; there is quality all the way around; and when you lift box they come in, you know you have are recieving a heavy duty product.I do recomment these extensions and I was really happy when I stumbled on a great sales price thru Amazon.com"
5,Works great,Does work great.This is a must have unless you are cutting very short pieces. I ordered both side and rear supports and use them religiously. An extra roller stand is next on my list for long pieces as I usually work alone.
2,"If you still get it, you don't get it","I was the biggest Fear fan. I saw them countless times and slammed my brains out with my gut full of suds. Hey hey, hey hey hey hey, I shunned responsibility, I didn't care about anybody, I thought women talked too much, cities (especially New York City) [were weak] and we should definitely [fight]the Russians! These songs were great, I laughed, I slammed. But now this bit just doesn't get me going any more. On top of that,I read on the inside cover Lee's totally sincere and loving dedication to his wife, child and pets. Ahh...that's sooo sweet. ..."
1,Total Rip-Off,Well. the dispenser is only worth about four bucks maybefive tops so that would make the tape about 18.00 a roll?Doesn't ANYONE think that that is a bit pricey for a rollof tape?? I just bought a SIX PACK of the exact same tapeat Sam's Club for 19.43 out the door....and I know it couldnot be much more than that at K-Mart or Wal-Mart!
3,NOT THE FLAME I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,I copped this right away thinking that the DMX and MOP tracks was just the intro to how blazing the CD would be but I found out it is the CD the rest are just average. The other bright spots are Genuwine and Faith tracks. It definitely has the feel of an underground mix tape but I am not sure exactly what it's missing but some of the production sounds amatuerish. They have an old freestyle with Biggie Smalls that's aight but I some things just need to be kept behind the scenes.
3,Funkmaster Flex review,"This album definatly not what I expected when I baught it. First off, I never thought I'd see the day when FMF would sell out, this album really took away from his unique style. Very few beats that kept me listening. Best songs were with MOP, Saukrates, and Da Franchise. Other than that, it sounded like the most commercial Def Jam Album ever. Ruff Ryder every where, Ludacris, not even the good members of Def Jam, like EPMD er anyone. Hit up redman, meth, specially wu, they got an album out. I suggest this CD to anyone who loves ""MTV Rap"", with a lil' taste of what else is out there."
3,Good copy but sloppy packaging,"The price was very good. The delivery time was fairly quick.The hardcover book itself was in good condition. However, its dust jacket wasn't. It is possible that's the way it was originally but I believe that was also obviously caused by the poor packaging job. The seller didn't use bubble wrap or a padded envelope or any protection but just sent the item in a thin manila envelope wrapped around the book with scotch tape."
1,A somnolent excursion to nowhere.,"As a big fan of most of Dan's work, it pains me to say that this book is incredibly boring. I can't believe all of the shining reviews for this. I know what they say opinions are like but still, I don't know how anyone could actually find this book rewarding or even good in the most basic sense. I won't waste time picking apart the plot because there really isn't one. Unless you keep effigies of Dan Simmons in your closet and pray to him at night, you probably want to skip this one and go with just about anything else he has written."
1,Just a really boring book.,"As a huge Dan Simmons Fan...I was eager to read this one.Well guess what?....Nothing happens!A guy who went to the moon once...hangs out with a younger girl, his old NASA pals, tries to repair his relationship with his adult son, goes hiking, goes to funeral, and takes a helicopter ride.There ya go, now you dont have to struggle through this, like I did."
2,Malefunction,"I think the camera itselfes is a good one, but unfortunately my model had a malefunction after 2 minutes of operation. During recording it shot off completely and could not be restated at all. So I had to sent the camcorder in to SONY service center. UPS shipping was $ 31,-!!!"
5,The Mammy,"Loved the book , funny and also sad but enjoyed every moment , could not put it down until I had finished it after watching all of the Mrs Browns Boys series I imagined just how the Mammy spoke and looked !"
2,"Slow moving, redundant, and written at a low reading level.","The people that weren't lucky enough to locate a copy of this book were the truely lucky ones. It was slow moving and repetitive. When I finished reading the book I was just glad to be done and felt like I had wasted a few hours. There wasn't any real insight into what it was like to grow up Dennis Green or what it was like to be a college coach or professional coach. Anyone who is thinking of reading this book to learn about what is like to be a player or coach in college or the NFL will be disappointed. Read Tim Green's book instead, it was much better! Todd Matt"
4,totally satisfied,I bought this telescope (spy glass) as a commemorative present for my son to mark a special event in his life. I was thoroughly pleased with the product and the process for buying it.
1,its a joke,"recieved this product a couple of days ago, and today i was going to sight in all my guns, rifles and pistols. scoped and iron sights. i found that the only gun it worked on was my 22 cal BAR. because the bore sight scope only has one hight, and all the scopes and sights can't aligin. making the bore sight useless. DON'T BUY IT!"
5,A must-have for any flutists repertoire.,"I started learning from this book when I was still in high school preparing for college auditions. It carried me all the way through music school and now my daughter is learning from it and I use it as an exercise book for my flute students. These etudes never get old to play. If I had the time, I would stand and play clear through the book from cover to cover just for fun!The pieces are composed to incorporate so many necessary exercises in fingering, tone and melodic technique. You can't go wrong having this collection in your repertoire."
4,"Discworld lite, for kids","Pre-teen near-witch teams up with drinkin', fightin', stealin', swearin' blue men. Oh, and they're six inches tall and live in a hive society. Together, they have to defeat an evil nightmare-controlling creature from another dimension.There's some of the Pratchett humour, a little of the Discworld mythos, in this first-of-a-trilogy. It has little overlap with the other novels except in the witch department.The book is riotously fun to read aloud, if ye kin doo the Pictsie voices wit' a proper Scots/Pict accent. (And if not, watch ""Trainspotting"" to practice...) Crivens!"
5,Great Fantasy for any age.,"I am enjoying this fantasy with much re-reading of passages to make sure I've got the ""scenes"" set correctly in my mind. I am enjoying especially the tactile sense of the materials and natural surroundings set in this title! The focus of this book is Tiffany: an inquisitive young lady who is trying to understand her fast paced world of unraveling reality. It truly takes me out of the present moment and into another world.The Wee Free Men (Discworld)"
5,A Kid's Book but Still Pratchett,Don't let the fact that this book is targeted towards children fool you. This book has all of the wit and charm that you have come to expect from Pratchett's books. Tiffany Aching is a bright young girl who is much more together than most of the adults in the story and the Nac Mac Feegles are some of Pratchett's funniest and most indearing characters to date. This book is deffinetly worth picking up no matter your age.
2,Be Careful,"We were on a very strict budget this year at Christmas and my daughter asked for this as her only Christmas gift. I couldn't afford the Amazon price, but clicked on the New and Used link where there was an affordable price from another seller. I ordered it, didn't look at it, just wrapped it and put it under the tree. Christmas morning my child opens her only gift and it's not illustrated. It was a sad Christmas morning. Learn from my mistake and check what you received before you give it as a gift. It may not be what it was listed as."
4,Nice,"Pratchett's Tiffany Aching series, being geared towards a younger audience, is toned down in seriousness, but not wit. If you're looking for a relaxing, fun read, this book is for you. The Kindle version is very well transferred, Pratchett's signature footnotes contain an interactive element; allowing the user to select the footnotes to read them, or wait until the end of the chapter. Altogether, an excellent value for money purchase."
4,Great RUSSIAN Toy,"This toy is actually a prize for the most important reason that RUSSIAN soldiers liberated Europe. I remember playing with one of these as a child in Norway and wondering what it was like to fight in battle, my father told me that Europe would be a different place if it wasn't for all the RUSSIAN soldiers who died to free it. This is a RUSSIAN soldier from the 1941-45 RUSSIAN campaign, main battles included Minsk, Smolensk, Stalingrad, Leningrad, Kharkov, etc. This is one of the best in the line and it is very durable and good for many hours of playing."
5,Really helps,"I use this, and the side extension more than I expected. It's essential for cutting large items, and much more efficient than setting up other kinds of supports."
5,Bosch TS1002 Table Saw Rear Outfeed Support Extension,Product arrived on time and in good condition. It took about 10 minutes to install on a Bosch 4100. The extension is sturdy and lines up well with the table.
5,Nice addition to a great saw,"If you own a Bosch 4000, you'll want to add this outfeed support. Saves you from performing a precarious balancing act when cutting long stock; improves quality of cut and enhances safety. A lot of value added for a relatively low price. Installs and operates easily and only increases the saw's storage footprint by a small fraction (adds approx. 4"" at back of table, not much wider than the footprint of the Gravity Rise stand)."
4,Very Good!,"I bought this perch for my umbrella cockatoo recently. I was worried that she would be a little too big for it, despite reading the other reviews. They were correct, she fits it perfectly, the perch is stable has a clip to hang a toy on it if desired. The one Pictured has 3 suction cups. The one I received only has 2 but it held steady even while she was dancing around on it."
1,i recived one suction cup and went to the store i bought the other there horrible copmany nerver again,i recived one suction cup and went to the store i bought the other there horrible copmany nerver again
5,"Peugeot PM20613 Elis U'Select Electric 8 Inch Pepper Mill, Stainless...","The first one did not work at all, so I sent it back for another one. The second one has worked like a champ. I previously had a cheaper mill that lasted about one year then broke. Ive had the Peugeot about 6 months and its working great. Ive refilled it at least 6 or 7 times and Im still on the original batteries. I'm very pleased with the performance of this product."
5,Finest book around on prayer,Do you want to -- really want to -- learn how to pray? READ THIS BOOK! Do you want to know how valuable prayer really is? READ THIS BOOK! Have you been looking for a book that will inspire you to go before God in prayer from the first chapter? READ THIS BOOK!
5,Strangers' Gate,"Adventure, sex, the best of the human spirit and darkest; from the first page to the very last, readers will find themselves captivated by extraordinary characters, beautifully described locales, and the charm of this accomplished writer. Strangers Gate will leave men lusting and dreaming of roads not taken, or perhaps reminiscing; women will find themselves with thoughts all too familiar, of what has been, could have been, or still can be. Sexual tension is laced throughout. Strangers' Gate is a brilliant lyrical torture of the senses."
5,Wonderful Christmas Read...,"I received this book for Christmas and that very night, I snuggled up in bed and read the whole thing--much to my husband's chagrin. Annabel is the perfect workaholic Ms. Scrooge in this novel. She is so bent on making her business work, that she ignores all of the pleasures life has to offer. Namely that of love.That is until she is reunited with her old crush, Quinn. She's delighted to see him and what's more he's just as happy to see her. He does everything in his power to make her see the beauty in life and within herself.Ms. Sharpe puts a steamy twist on an old tale that is guaranteed to warm not only your heart, but your body as well."
5,Another great lost 80s soul album,"A prolific session vocalist and musician, former Star Search winner Peggi Blu has made a few albums under her own name but remains barely a blip on the radar in that respect. While her voice lacks the deep richness of someone like Anita Baker or Chaka Khan, she more than makes up for it with her classy stylishness and ability to sing high and mighty. The album opens with the robust, stylish midtempo number ""Tender Moments"" (which she did manage to have a minor hit with), and ""All And All"" is a great ballad, as is ""All The Way With You"" on which she duets with Bert Robinson, a deep-voiced, Teddy Pendrgrass-like soul crooner who also pretty much went nowhere, unfortunately."
5,Use it if you dare,"This is a wonderful companion workbook to Pia Mellody's Facing Codependence. Mellody first has you read specific pages in Facing Codependence, after which she has you complete the corresponding writing exercises in Breaking Free. The exercises are short, thorough, and extremely well organized -- and because of that, not hard to do. Keep in mind though that if you do the exercises, you might never think about your relationships the same way again. And that's a GOOD thing -- or at least it was for me. I'd highly recommend this to anyone wanting to change dysfunctional relationship patterns."
2,Stories are *NOT* complete,"Be careful with this book. ""Go Dog Go"" and ""Fox in Socks"" are not included, only short excerpts as with 3 other Dr. Suess ""stories"" included. 5 of the remaining 11 stories are less than 3 pages."
4,"Very nice pillow, but description misleading","I like these pillows a lot, and they are very comfortable to sleep on. They would receive 5 stars but for the difference between the Amazon description and the pillow labels. The misleading things are that 1) the label on these pillows states these down pillows are 75% down. I expected 100% down from the description. 2) twice in the descriptions it says the pillows are ""machine washable"". The label on the pillows clearly says ""DRY CLEAN ONLY"". Amazon?"
1,Picture and product sent are not the same,I emailed the company with no response. I was sent tools that are different from the picture on amazon.
5,Great buy,"I got this for tricep toning since I can't do that well with dumb bells. But I was pleasantly surprised that you can do so many other workouts with this. For the triceps toning it was wonderful and did exactly what I expected and more. The medium strength band was perfect for me, I'm a woman who works out pretty regularly, but by no means a body builder. Perfect item for small places."
3,Nice product,"This is a durable exercise rope, however it does not give a huge amount of resistance. If you are really going for sculpt and bulk get free weights."
3,"good idea, but a bit disapointing",I received this as a Christmas gift. I was highly disapointed that it did not come with directions on how to attach it to the door or even how to properly use it -- even though both were listed on the packaging.
5,great resistance band,"The resistance band has been useful exercise equipment. It arrived quickly, in great condition, and has been very satisfactory."
