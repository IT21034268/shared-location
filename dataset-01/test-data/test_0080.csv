2,Disappointing,"As a college student who is used to cheap ball point pens, I thought I'd try something different this spring with the UniBall Vision Elite. I really love the blue/black color, and the pens do write beautifully. However, I was hoping that, for the price, they'd last longer. I bought a pack of four pens, and each one has lasted me less than 2 weeks before running dry, roughly 30 or 40 pages of writing, using the front side of the paper only because the ink tends to bleed through a little. I won't be buying these again."
4,I use it to monitor my portion of snacks,"This bakeware is strong, inexpensive and can be used for a custard, pudding or to help me realize how much I eat with snacks. It's a good control."
5,Fantastic,these are perfect - go from frig to microwave or oven. Used for portion control and is just the perfect size
1,Un-Essential information,"An excellent and educational book, if only the author had stayed to the real essentials. Approximately two thirds of the information is unrelated to actual Reiki, but the author seems to find this necessary to enhance her admittedly feminine-chauvinistic style of Reiki."
3,Good but annoying,"I found the book very informative and I was grateful to have an opportunity to study the symbols prior to taking an actual Reiki class. The book is very easy to read, but I found the authors exclusive use of she/her and the feminine gender extremely annoying and unprofessional. The book should have been written in a neutral gender embracing everyone. Ms. Stein obviously has some deep rooted problems revolving around men. It is unfortunate that she felt the need to vent this in her book. Shouldn't a Reiki Master be a little more evolved than that? Maybe the second printing should be renamed ""Essential Reiki for Women""."
1,Un-Essential New Age Reiki,"This book is a good example of what happens when you take an overtly angry Wiccan Feminist - mix in chakras, crystals, and 'higher vibrations' with a good healthy dose of New Age 'Reiki'.There is nothing between the front and back covers that is based on factual information. What this book talks about is not Japanese, is not Usui's teachings, and is definitely not Traditional Reiki.It is interesting, for such an angry feminist, that she tries to link Reiki to both Buddha and Jesus - even with a time line - when they are both patriarch systems.Her knowledge of the history of Reiki and Japan is nil. Her history of Buddhism is amply as bad. She freely mixes cultures, beliefs, religions, and fiction into one big soupy mess.This is the epitome of Western Reiki and the antithesis of Traditional Japanese Reiki.Buy any other book on Reiki and save your money here."
4,Diane Stein**** is mother healer,"hello, i am raghavnedra from bangalore.i have read this book. you have explained the attunement process very well. there is no other book compare to attunement process. reiki excerise for men &women is very good. i practice this excerise twice a daily."
3,extra cost,I was very disappointed to find the cost of this item incerased by 12.35.I think you should make people who dont live in the USA that there is extra duty to pay on imports over 15.The total cost of this item to me was almost 35 I would not have bought it had I known.
5,Excellent Reiki Information,"This book provides the Reiki student with all the necessary information. My work is with Diane in that I travel all over the world teaching Essential Reiki, passing attunements to students on all 3 levels. I am available for teaching classes. Cantact me at womenwwings@igc.org Carolyn Taylor, San Francisco, California, USA"
3,"Good, But ...","Basically what sells this maxi single is that Eye Hate U is a spectacular song in and of itself. The remixes are good, but conventional. You won't find any real differences here from the album version, with the exception of Eric Leeds's fantastic horn on the Quiet Night remix. My advice, go out and find a copy of the criminally out of print Gold Experience. you'll get Eye Hate U, plus Prince's best album of the O(+> period."
1,DVD Record Lockup - Bad Software Design,"Hi,I have had this VCR/DVD Recorder less than one year. Prior to software failure, I was concerned with the unit loading software and blocking the recording (failure message) of various shows. The DVD recorder started to freeze during recording; no problem with VCR recording. Finally after 9 months of ownership, the unit locked up in DVD mode and was not recoverable.My first recorder analog VCR ""Panasonic"" lasted 7 years until the drive system stopped.I feel that programming bugs caused this failure. Toshiba should have just install EPROMs instead of trying live communication with transmissions to block VHF transmissions.Terrible Design!!"
2,Slow and complicated,"Remember the first VCRs? When one had to tune the tuner with a set of instructions writen by an engineer who didn't speak or write English so good. That is this product. Very complicated to use, I have it working but the response time to the remote is pitifully slow. Just to open the DVD drawer or eject a tape takes forever. On screen menu is pretty good is the best I can say for this product. Like going back to DOS."
3,From Back Cover,"After years of making every possible wrong choice, Danielle Stone is taking control of her life. And choosing a new lover is the perfect way to start - especially when that lover looks like gorgeous Nick Vaux. Tall, dark and oh-so-sexy, Nick has a way of seeing into her very soul. The connection between them is so strong, Danielle would swear they've been lovers before.And they have...Nicholai Vaux has been waiting a century to have Danielle in his arms again. In another lifetime, he and Danielle were husband and wife, sharing a love beyond measure - and it seems, beyond time. Now Nick is desperate to reunite with the woman he knows is his true soul mate. But first he has to convince Danielle - before the past catches up with both of them....[Follow-up to Up to No Good and Essence of Midnight (""Surrender"")]"
5,"Sit back, relax and listen...........",".........for a change. acts 2,3 are recorded complete and uninterupted on it's own cd. yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayThe singers are great and so is the recording.Get this recording and relax. no side breaks.lose a little atmosphere, yeah, but you gain some too with no act breaks."
5,The New Great Game,Very informative; gives an historic picture of what's behind the current conflicts in Central Asia; none of this information is what you get in the newspapers or on TV. The reporting has no political agenda.
3,Smug,"Mr.Kleveman is full of crap and the worst part is he knows this. If he were able to write this without such ill will for industrialized nations, it might have been good."
1,Nothing New Here,Great topic but you won't find anything here that you couldn't learn by simply reading the daily newspapers and international news magazines.
5,Beautiful,"Buber begins the book by giving an introduction to the Hasidim, the ultra-orthodox, mystically inclined branch of Judaism founded by Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer, a.k.a. the Baal-Shem Tov (which literally means ""master of the good name"" = master of God's name). Buber then proceeds to relate 20 stories/legends about the Baal-Shem's life and teaching, followed by a glossary of the key terms in the book.The wonderful thing about this book is its beautiful, poetic simplicity. The language is poetic, and the stories are profound because they show that in the middle of the 1700's, God became a vibrant, living reality to a group of common folk in eastern Europe. ""God desires the heart,"" taught the Baal-Shem.On a personal note, this book opened my eyes to a side of both life and God that I have never seen before. Live life with joy and humility, live it deeply and with passion. God rejoices and dances with us in our joy.""God desires the heart."" How simple, yet how utterly profound."
2,Sor Juana: a sparking biography,"It's not easy to write a biography keeping ideological distance from the Biographed. But Octavio Paz, one of the most sparking writer and thinker of the 20th century, surpassed that classic absence of impartiality with this classic Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, whose life and work raises the weight curtain that helps the reader to understand the entanglements of the closed aristocracy of the Nueva España of the end of the 17th century. The life of Sor Inés is a hypnotical succession of enigmas, intrigues and ambiguities. Besides, she was a forerunner of the feminist conquests who started in the 19th century. Paz worked for four decades until the conclusion of this astonishing book. If he had nothing wrote, scarcely this work would be enough for him to be considered a truly literary and superb genius.J.C.Ismael"
3,Space Shuttle and terrorism from a legislative point of view,"Back in the late 1980's, the Space Shuttle program was all the rage as the topic of stories and movies. What make this novel unique was that a Senator and space advocate wrote it (mostly). Beyond that uniqueness, with it's intricate real experience detail, Night Launch is just another technothriller."
5,Great Learning Tool,For anyone with a loved one suffering with Alzheimer's this is the book to get. It will help you understand the disease and how to cope. Written in everyday language it is packed with information on the stages these victims go through and how you can help them. One of the best I've read!
4,Good combo,"I purchased 2 sets of these chairs to go with the Firepit Table. It's a great combo. The chairs are very comfortable.One set of chairs was damaged. However, Amazon came and collected them and sent a new set with minimal fuss.My main criticism is that you cannot get close enough to the table. The table is too low, so the chair arms touch the edge. It seems okay. When people are having dinner, we all tend to sit on the edge of the chairs. Not ideal, but it works."
5,brilliant,i feel that to try to qualify the genius of this film would be an insult to it. either you get it or you don't. but this film left me breathless...
3,Brian's Song reviewed by ADW,"Brian's Song is the story of two men, Brian Picolo and Gale Sayers and how they came to be friends. They fight for the same job but to find out who gets it you have to read the book.Their friendship is tested when Brian becomes ill. I thought the book was good but it made me sad. To find out why, you'll have to read it."
5,Love this conditioner!,"They do not sell this brand of conditioner/shampoo where I live, but my cousins from CA had some during their recent visit. I love this product. Most kid shampoos claim to be 2 in 1, but that is never the case. My 5 year old has a tender head, so this conditioner is a must. It smells great and makes combing through hair a breeze."
4,"Great smelling conditioner, perfect for daily use","My seven-year-old has fine hair and I found that regular shampoo had a harsh effect on her hair. After reading several reviews of the L'Oreal Paris Kids hair care products, I decided to purchase the shampoo, conditioner, and swim shampoo. The results have been wonderful thus far. My daughter loves the smell and the cute containers, and the conditioner has been wonderful for everyday use as it does not dry her hair out. I'm even using it myself. I just wish the range came in larger containers."
4,The volume button is fixed with the new version!,"I had the Tiny Love Mobile with my first-born (Tiny Love Geometric Shapes, which, unfortunately has been discontinued) and purchased the Light and Music mobile for my daughter. The bright colors, the calming classical music, and the cute animals keep my daughter intertained for lengthy time periods. The volume botton has been fixed with the new version (make sure the music box is yellow / white instead of green and the handles are blue instead of orange). We had to return the previous versoin as the volume reset was way too annoying - once the mobile shut off, it would reset itself to high volume. One thing that I would like to see is an option for music only ... right now, there is an option for rotation, rotation with light, light only and off. Nothing with just music ... Thus, I give this product a 4*"
1,Nice looking but not functional,"This is a really cute mobile. When it was working, my son loved it. He talked to it for at least 20 minutes at a time. However, it stopped working after a couple of weeks. (And yes, I changed the batteries--twice!) The music played, but the mobile wouldn't turn. Another problem is that it does not stay in place. The base is very heavy, and difficult to secure to the side of the crib. The base twists, causing the arm to fall to the side, which could potentially hurt a child. It is very cute, but I would not recommend it."
5,Wonderful Folklore,This is a wonderful book. It ebbs and flows with a rhythm of its own. I read both of Velma's books and they are both wonderful.
5,Musical,"This man has been inbetween and everywhere around the music industry. With his father a big timer in the music industry with making people like Sade famous, Justin Warfield is just pure amazing. He went through bands like One Inch Punch to Tape and now to an amazing alternative/new wave band called SHE WANTS REVENGE. He appeared randomly around and there. From the Romeo and Juliet movie soundtrack to being a guest MC with Placebo in ""Spite and Malice"". This guy has pure talent and you should all definately check out his new band called She Wants Revenge. Collaborating with Dj Adam 12 (whom is even as amazing as Justin and very sweet guy not to mention) My Field Trip to Plan 9 is a GREAT hip hop album.. upbeat and twisting ryhmes. For fans for A Tribe Called Quest/De La Soul/Eric B & Rakim/Public Enemy.. this is for you.."
3,Oregon 23736A Chain sharpening guide,"Kind of flimsy and I cannot seem to get the clamp to hold tight enough for filing yet let the chain move freeley between teeth in order to sharpen the next tooth. However, my chain is probably sharpened better than I could have done without the guide. You will need this guide plus whatever diameter files required for the chain on your saw."
3,Nice collection of tunes in a wierd style,"The performance is on a programmable house organ. I found the music unusual and rather entertaining. When I played the CD for others they objected immediately! This was more a matter of taste than performance. I have played the CD twice and may play it again at some point, but this type of music performance is definitely an acquired taste."
2,Snubby,"I'm having a problem with the RECORDING staying on. The Customer support for this product is terrible. In this day and age in my opinion they should have developed and on-line chat support team. However you first have to locate the e-mail, and they don't make it easy. So far I'm not please with this product. I'm still working with customer support to resolve my issues and each time you request information via e-mail you have to wait 24 hours. for your response. This really sucks to be perfectly honest.Acoustica Spin It Again Vinyl RestorationOh, must Iforget the software tells you the label maker is included in this purchase, it pretends its downloading then you find out its not you need to purchase the actual acoustica label maker. This is not a great product. I'm very disappointed."
3,obscure but decent horror classic,"The editing is a bit uneven and the picture quality is less than pristine but that doesn't spoil this horror treat. A good cast headed by Jack Palance, an off beat story, and crisp direction keep ""Craze"" on track."
3,Cute but a pain,"This night light is so cute, but is a pain to change the light bulb. You have to go at it with a screwdriver every time to change it. My child had in a on for long periods of time so we were changing it a lot. It is very cute, however, and she loves it for that reason."
4,"Very good collection of ""Lectures""","This book is for those who already understand corporate finance basics. It is a collection of papers by famous and not-so-famous authors, exploring capital structure, investment policy, risk managemt, corporate financial restructuring and other nice details on the new thoughts of corporate finance. It is indispensible for those dealing with the subject, as a mean to refresh the concepts. Can bee seen as a set of separate lectures. Lacks a bit of structure and guidance when you need to attack a problem, since some articles subjects overlap. Definetely worth the price."
4,Good for children over 5 years old,We bought this for our niece and she is 3 years old. I think that she really enjoys her Barbie but because of the small parts I would probably give it to an older child. Cute and her dad is a photograher so it was prefect gift for the whole family.
5,This is one of the best books I've ever read.,This book is so awsome. I loved the way Brittany Ryan wrote this book. Extremely well written and it's got a very cool story line.Normally I wouldn't like a story like this. I'm more of the Harry Potter type. But something in this book drew me in and I couldn't put the book down.Five stars all the way around!!!
5,Officially My Favorite!,I've never read a book more than once... until now! Sissy LeBlanc's life was surely worth writing about! This needs to be a movie!!
4,One hot summer in Louisiana,"A good read about Sissy LeBlanc in the small Louisiana town of Gentry losing her virginity and finding the soulmate that she thought she lost in high school. The story will keep you fascinated until the end. I had difficulty with the relationship that Sissy had with her father-in-law. The relationship with the father-in-law was really a turn off but it makes for a great story.Also the story was not era appropriate in some places. The timeframe was the 1940's and 1950's and the story referenced a naugauhyde chair in the 1950's. Naugauhyde was not invented or used in chairs until the late 1960's and also Clara and Sissy referred to Parker as a stud in the 1950's. The word stud was really not used in the 50's. However, if you want to read a novel about love conquering all and with some intrigue too, then this book is captivating."
5,Don't listen to the one star givers,"I must say, that anyone who has given this game one star is stupid. This game was fun on many levels. It had survival horror, comedy, and excitement. There was bad voice acting, but on purpose to add to the B Horror movie surroundings and plot. The graphics were excellent, except for the fact that the mouths don't move. The soundtrack is great, sadly.......There is no soundtrack for sale. And, lastly, I want to say that this game is given 5 stars only because there is not an option for anything higher. DO NOT listen to these brainless and psychotic people who have no taste what-so-ever. If the game sucked so much, than they wouldn't be porting it on the XBOX."
1,Badly in need of copy editing,"It's amazing McGraw-Hill let this one out at all. There are typographical and syntactical errors on almost every page. I can't comment on technical accuracy, as I am a beginner at astronomy. But I do know when I've seen the same photograph twice with different, and inconsistent, captions. The publisher did a real disservice to the author of this edition--and to the memory of the author of the original version--by rushing this to market without at least showing it to a copy editor."
4,Excellent reference book,"As an amateur in astronomy, I found this book very educative. It covers all aspects of astronomy - from naked eye view of the sky to deep space objects, binocular to large telescope obesrvation, etc. Though it was written in 1989, the book will continue to be a reference book to all interested in astronomy."
4,LEARNING ABOUT CREATIVITY FROM THE LIFE OF STEVEN SPIELBERG,"THIS WAS VERY INFORMATIVE IN REGARDS TO MR. SPIELBERG. THE BOOK DETAILS WHO EXACTLY THIS MAN IS, WHAT COMPELLS HIM TO DO THE MOVIES THAT HE DOES AND WHAT IS HIS DRIVING FORCE. A MUST READ FOR ANY MOVIE FAN, BUT ESPECIALLY A SPIELBERG FAN!"
5,Outstanding group and a great album,"I first ran across this group when I was stationed on Hawaii. There were quite a few groups that I had never heard of and Kalapana was one of those, but I soon was listening to their music whenever I could. Really worth your time. Great album."
3,classic staple,"for hiking and picnics, this is a timeless classic. If you are hoping to get through a three-day camping trip with kids and dad - forget about it. I bought this set months ago - the fry pan is starting to dent on the bottom from spatula use - I'll use it a few more times, and then buy another set for the next hiking season. They are light weight, they clean up easy, you can feed one person just fine (say a can of soup and a grilled cheese sandwich for instance - also good for a half can of corned beef hash) I'm just not that careful with my stuff, and these are so cheap and quick to deliver, so I consider them ""disposable""."
1,Does not work with USA dvd players,"I bought this for my one year old. It is not compatible for the United States DVD player. I even tried to view it from my computer, but it is unreadable in the `USA zone'. It will cost me more in shipping to return to the UK, so I am stuck with a DVD that doesn't work.Useless dvd... don't buy from PBShop if you live in the USA!"
4,Surprising,"I was surprised that I enjoyed the movie. Clean, well acted, unusual script.Don't expect too much, sit back and enjoy."
1,REGION B!!!!!!!!!!!,"This disc is region B locked so unless you have a region B player, DO NOT BUY!If you already have return it. I should of noticed the optimum home video label but alas, I did not."
1,very boring,well i didn't like this movie i watch one hour and igot so bored that i stopped the dvd and i din't watch the endtoo much blah blahh blahh blahhhhhhhh for nothing and i think it is very bad filming it is always moving
2,"IT'S A REGION ""B"" BLU-RAY!","Tenha cuidado com a regio do Blu-Ray, pois o que eu comprei deste vendedor é Regio ""B"", que no roda no meu PS3 americano."
1,Boring,"Boring movie about a dysfunctional society and its people in a deranged cultural setting.I'm sorry to say I paid to see it, but happy to say I stopped watching before it was over."
1,Disapointment,I am very disapointed since I received a Blue Ray for Zone B (Europe) and I cannot watch it in the US???How Amazon does this in the US?
5,The movie is about social issues and not just violence.,"The movie is quite violent, so it will appeal to action movie fans, but more than that, it is a social movie.I was born and raised in Rio, close to one of the many favelas in that city.Years ago, I attended the same university one of the characters in the movie did. The students there are accurately depicted. They are upper middle class students that preach peace and social services, but while doing that, they also smoke pot. When I didn't see any problems at the time, but now, I can see the hypocrisy of preaching peace, but also financing the violence by smoking pot.I also have a really good high school friend that's a Capitain now in the PM (Military Policy). He's not part of that Elite Squad, but he's an honest cop. So while severly underpaid, there ARE honest cops out there.Not really a movie review, but a rant, but this movie was quite realistic and nostalgic for me."
5,Great for Everyday Use,"I love these bowls! I use them daily for cereal (I like a big bowl of cereal). They're heavy, sturdy, and easy to clean. The bottom is a little rough though, so it might scratch a wood table."
3,Just Good,"This was a good movie; but I am not use to seeing Stanwyck play helpless or getting into a bad situation and needing help except for when she played in "" Dial M for Murder"". However, it is a good movie for your noir collection."
2,Beware of poor audio quality,"I bought this CD since I've heard the song Good Night Irene by various artists, love it and wanted to hear the original. Beware of very poor audio quality. A later digitally remastered release may be advisable. Two stars are only due to audio quality."
1,Substandard Foot Control,My Foot Control On This Motor Lasted About 1 Year.The Cost Of A New One Is $75 - $100I Would Not Purchase Any Minn-Kota With ThisType Of Foot Control.
5,Follow-up To My Previous Review About Poor Picture Quality,"This is a follow-up to my previous review below.I was so disappointed with the quality of the print that I repurchased a another copy from Warner Archives and I am extremely pleased. It is an official copy so the print is very clear. I watched it on a 55"" LED and a 32"" LCD and the picture and sound are great.************************************************Good Movie But Do Not Purchase Copy from Blax Films - Horrible Picture QualityI love this movie so when I saw it listed on Amazon I was very excited. It's a little dated but I love it anyway.Anyway, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this movie. It is the quality of a bootleg DVD. While watching the movie the Black Starz logo appears in the lower right corner of the screen. This makes me question the legitimacy of this DVD."
2,Promotes unhealthy eating,"My kids absolutely love the Little People videos. But this one I hated. Just about every episode on this DVD promotes unhealthy eating: chocolate cake, donuts, cookies, cotton candy... So we're getting rid of it. Very disappointed. I do recommend Discovering Your Neighborhood though. It's my kids' favorite."
3,"Why, Seth, why!!!!","Okay. By my title you can tell I am a Seth Green fan. I love the guy. Thought Oz was the best character ever. Then on a bad stormy day (in my mind) I learned that Seth was leaving Buffy to do a movie Knockaround guys. It was hard at first, but I got over it as long as I got to watch the movie. Well two years later the movie is released. You think. However, it was decided to held back until Vin Disl became famous. So I don't watch it at the theater because the one in my town is too small. So I stupidly decide to buy just cause Seth is in it. Big Mistake!! One I was bored, two there was maybe one scene I liked, and three Seth died in it. So if you are a Seth fan and you want to see it because of him, rent it first and if you like it then go ahead and buy it. You have been warned."
3,it was OK,"wasn't what I expected but, it was OK....ending was predictable. I wouldn't recommend it at all! BORING actually. All been done before!"
1,THIS IS NO MAFIA MOVIE,"First off this is a hollywood movie that wants to make quick money of big stars that should not be doing gangster movies, Dennis Hooper, John M, are not gangster role material, Vin is money maker for action films, Seth is a comic star, Barry is a drama or action co star, IF YOU WANT TO SEE A BETTER MOVIE THEN CHECK OUT ""WANNABES"" this is an ok movie for a bunch of guys shooting guys but thats it it is noway in the league of ""Godfather, Goodfellas, Casino, Meanstreets, or Scarface""RENT IT DONT BUY IT"
3,"Good, but not great","I was looking for a Stephen Foster CD that was not ""jazzed up"" and maintained the closest fidelity to the old-time recordings. This CD did not disappoint. Most of the renditions of the lesser-known Foster classics are excellent. ""Old Black Joe"" is particularly moving.My only problem is with the two old standards: Camptown Races and Oh! Susanna. I get the impression that the vocalist was trying to put his own ""stamp"" on these two very familiar tunes by accenting odd syllables or using strange intonations. At any rate, they ended up sounding cheesy so that my family members ended up making fun of the idiosyncracies introduced by the singer rather than singing along with the familiar words and melody. Oh! well..."
2,"Close, but no cigar","The dish was essentially as expected, and securely packed for shipping, but the lip on the lid is not sufficiently deep to prevent it sliding off the dish under very light pressure or tilting."
3,it is okay for the price,"Ok, if you need a casserole dish not too much expensive, strong : it is okay.But, the lid does not fit well with the bottom and slick all the time. When your dish is hot in the oven and you went to remove it from the oven, it is really dangerous because it can slide on your hands"
4,What About Debbie?,This is the second in the Addams Family Saga..Where Uncle Fester is looking for a Bride..He falls for the New nanny Debbie who is not out to look after the children but to help herself to Uncle Festers Money..Debbie is played by Joan Cusack who will have u rolling out of your seat she's so funny..
5,Sabrina Updated,"I love both this and the original version of Sabrina. However, both contain the same flaw - it is virtually impossible to believe that Sabrina will toss aside her affections for the attractive younger brother to fall in love with the MUCH OLDER brother. I am a big fan of both Humphrey Bogart and Harrison Ford, but each was too much older than his leading lady for believability. Yet, despite that flaw, both versions of the movie are excellent. Both movies are witty, romantic versions of the classic Cinderella type."
4,Very well done remake!,They stayed true enough to the story with just enough modern updates. A real fairytale.
1,"How to make Paris, New York and love all simultaneously a snooze","I don't see how anyone can enjoy this movie. Harrison Ford is essential lifeless. Well, a corpse might act a bit better. And Julia Ormond looks like she is in a trance the whole time. Now, I would submit that Humphrey Bogart was also unappealing to me in the original, but at least Audrey Hepburn could carry the film. No such luck here. I could not have been more disappointed."
2,No chemistry,"I was very disappointed with this movie. I felt that Ormond and Ford had no chemistry at all. I get so tired of the older man/much younger woman syndrome. Ormond's transformation from mousy young girl to sophisticated woman was completely unbelievable. Harrison Ford gives her little reason to switch alliances, but she does anyway making her appear very shallow. I usually like most romantic comedies but his one was definitely a waste of time."
2,One of the worst remakes I've ever seen,"Greg Kinear was great of course. He is incapable of giving a bad performance and the part was perfect for him. No William Holden by any means but he did a good job. Julia Ormond was so miscast that it was pathetic. In her one scene when she has just arrived from Paris and is supposed to be so stunning, she simply ISN'T. What was so bad was that they show her all the time she is in Paris looking terrible then we are supposed to believe that the day before she left Paris she got a makeover. Ridiculous. I guess nobody could have stood the comparison with Audrey Hepburn but she wasn't even in the ballpark. Harrison Ford did the best he could but he was just terribly miscast. Sometimes I've wondered - does he really think that heavy breathing through his nose is acting? Trust me, if you want to see ""Sabrina"", get a copy of the original B&W."
3,Good but lacks charm of original,"This movie is a sweet romantic comedy but it lacks the charm which Audry Hepburn, William Holden, and Humphry Bogart brought to the original. Additionally some of the alterations made to create a more modern film compramise the integrity of the film. Overall I recommend the original version. There is a reason the original has remained a highly acclaimed film for almost half a century, and this version has slipped in its renound over time."
1,Sabrina,I would LOVE to rate this product but I am still waiting for it to arrive. Please tell me what to do???
5,Gets the job done.,"Nicely made product, easy dishwasher cleanup, and does an even and excellent job at whisking x x x x x"
4,Another Well Executed Trip into Another Set of Influences,"With this new effort, Simon continues a musical journey that was just a step over subliminal in his earliest solo efforts and became decidedly blatant with Graceland and the much-overlooked Rhythm of the Saints. Here, some period doo-wop and Latino influences are merged to marvelous effect, particularly on the light and lovely ""Bernadette"", as pure a piece of pop as Simon ever wrote. While the musical from whece it is mined may have been a chaotic mess, this cycle of songs holds together quite nicely."
1,UGH! SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Like many of you, I am a big ""Simon fan."" I was absolutely THRILLED when I saw that he had this ""great new album!"" However, I was TERRIBLY disappointed when I listened to it. I liked two songs out of the whole thing, and even THOSE were only so-so. Not like him at all! No, siree, I only listened to it a couple times, and I haven't listened to it since! A BAAAAAAD change, I must say!"
5,good music,"I really like this album even though the broadway musical tanked. The more I have listened to the music the more I want to listen to it. Paul simon is a genious. I have just been to the simon and garfunkle reunion tour, and it,too,was incredible. I love all of paul simon's music-it wears very well-this album included."
2,Good ideas; Poor presentation,"I agree with the basic premise & many of the ideas espoused by ""Fire The Nanny"". However, it is poorly written, contains mathematical errors, and has multiple typographical errors.There are other books that cover similar material with more information and less self-righteous ""preaching"" --- Any of Amy Dacyczyn's books far surpass this one for content and readablilty.""Fire The Nanny"" may be worth reading, but it is not worth buying. Borrow it from your local library or someone (like me) who bought it in ignorance."
2,good-looking but too heavy,"The teapot certainly looks attractive and is pretty inexpensive. However, it is unexpectedly heavy. When filled with liquid it is very hard to pour without using both hands."
2,"Another ""love one song"" disc","Heard ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" on NPR and ordered based on hearing just that one song. Should have known better. That basically is the only song I liked on the CD. Expected more of a traditional Spanish guitar sound."
1,Bond copy,"This is one of several movies that cashed in on the Bond craze. This particular one is the worst of the copies. The low budget limits the exotic location shots and make the story very slow and dragging. There are none of the artistic photographic angles and effects common in the Bond films. It is about an insurance investigator who is looking into organized crime. The plot is totally devoid of any imagination or surprises. The one unusual feature is that some of the gratuitous violence is done by women who appear to be bored with their violent work. The women and their clothes were very flashy by standards of 40 years ago, but will have no romantic effects on healthy men of today. Notice how the women piled their hair on top of their head and then wrapped a turban around it."
1,I threw it away!,This flavor was so terrible that I ended up throwing it away after trying it once. I absolutely love the vanilla ice cream royale and the strawberry banana smoothie flavors of this same product. I bought the chocolate mint flavor based on positive reviews - so maybe it was just me but I really could not stand it!
1,what a waste....Whip this into the garbage,I received this as a gift. It is terrible. I stopped sing it after 20 seconds and went back to my regular wisks. To top it off... is doesn't fit well in drawers... I moved it to my Good Will box after a week.
5,A Great Series!,"What was amazing about this book was the number of great ideas compiled into one place. With over 600 activities, let alone the learning centers, you are introduced to a whole new way of looking at teaching and sharing the world with your children. Another great thing about the book is the fact that these activities have been submitted and selected by a wide array of diverse authors, so you are not getting one person's thoughts on how to teach, but you are getting the best of all and these authors share their experiences and knowledge with you as you move forward! This is an amazing resource for any early childhood teacher and one that I would highly recommend!"
3,DESIGN FLAW,Ideally the bar should not try to rotate in your hands while you are curling the bar; unfortunately this bar does try to rotate.
5,best author,"I think V C Andrews is a really great author even though a ""ghost writer"" has been doing her books for the last 20 years. The books themselves are often spellbinding and full of twists and turns. I haven't read her books in years and greatly enjoy reading them again on my kindle and reading the new series that have come out. I think V C Andrews will go down as one of the best authors of this time period'"
4,I liked this book but it should have been a little different,"I thought this book was ok and all but I hated the romance between Heaven and Troy. I thought it was missing something. Then when I found out who Troy really was, it made it even wrose. I thought her and Logan made a much better couple, even if he was a jerk to her for awhile. If Troy wasn't in this book it would have gotton 5 stars from me."
2,disappointing,after reading the wonderful Heaven I moved on to Dark Angel thinking it would be just as good. I was wrong. The romance between her and Troy just didn't have me convinced. I hope Fallen Hearts will be a little better.
4,Nicely designed but watch for defects...,"My wife and I like these simple, easy to use noodle bowls. They're our favorite for eating rice and rice dishes. However, inspect your set carefully. Our first arrived with a cracked bowl, and the second arrived with spoons that were flawed. Once we had a good set, however, we found them to be keepers!"
1,Beware: PG stands for profanity galore,"Beautiful scenery and a decent family movie except that we're returning it to the seller because we can't imagine showing our kids a movie with ""go to hell"" and ""faggot"" spoken by child characters!! Also several fistfights, a scary wolf scene and lots of guns and death. Beware all you parents of sensitive, empathetic children like ours. Who rated this movie PG?!!"
2,Great movie - questionable language,"Very good movie but I have a 6 and 9 year old who were watching it and when the one boy called the other a [...] got I then had to try to explain to my kids what it meant. Of course they are going to hear that kind of thing some time but don't surprise me with it by putting it in a ""Paramount Family Favorites"" picture with a ""winner of the 1995 parents choice award"" on the cover. Very disappointed in that."
4,Piste sonore franaise absente.,"J'ai bien aimé ce film familial; ce que je déplore, cependant, c'est qu'il n'y ait pas de piste sonore franaise bien qu'il soit indiqué sur le botier qu'il en existe une. Tous les renseignements qui apparaissent sur ce botier sont bilingues ce qui laisse croire qu'il y a effectivement une piste franaise, mais ce n'est pas le cas. Je crois qu'on devrait éviter ce type d'erreur pour ne pas créer de déception."
3,this is more to do with the video then the episode,This is the only season that isn't in hd will it be available in hd in the futher . im hopping someone from amazon will read this. As far as the episode itself it is one of my favorites of that season. Customers should watch it if they get the chance.
1,I will not spend $39 for this based on the other reviews,"Thanks to those of you who warned us not to purchase this set. I have Seasons 1-9 and love them. I'm very disappointed to read from so many of you that this Season's set is sub-par and not remastered. Very surprising given Paramount/CBS's previous excellence. For the sake of owning the whole series I want to purchase this set, even if it isn't remastered. But I WILL NOT pay upward of $40 for poor quality picture and sound. When Amazon lowers the price to what I'm willing to pay, I'll purchase it. But I'm not going to allow myself to get ripped off. Hopefully Paramount/CBS will come to their senses and not screw the consumer on Seasons 11 & 12, returning to FULLY REMASTERED sets."
1,Lousy Audio,"Paramount/CBS has really screwed up on Season 10 of Hawaii 5-0.The audio is terrible. The volume level is way too low.There is no depth to the audio even when you turn it up on your monitor.This set should be recalled and redone! The previous 9 seasons were well done, but they really messed up on this one."
2,whoa.. I didnt want to see that,half way thru the movie the main character starts having sex with other men.nasty. Im into graffii but gay sex ruined the movie for me. I had no idea this was a gay romance movie.
5,Good Quality,I was really pleased with this set of pan. They are a wonderful weight and quality. I've had perfect results everytime I've used them.
2,Largest Pan,"2 of the 3 pans were fine. Largest pan has a flat, bad spot. Return postage too much to rectify issue. Kept it and will replace it at a local store."
5,Pans,"Dings on large pan, but useable. They came very fast and good price. The cakes are a very nice rounded edge."
1,See baby animals eat other animals,"I bought this video for my wife. She loves that pampers commercial on t.v. where grown up animals guide baby animals around. She hates nature shows that involve large, fierce, animals eating smaller ones.This video opens with a small animal being killed and then fed to the baby of a fierce carnivore. It goes down hill from there.The production quality is lousy, the narration fatuous and patronizing - it reminds me of a world war II propaganda piece.Not recommended."
5,The best album by a hugely underrated band,"""Hypocrite"" is one of the very best songs of the decade, and the rest of the album is almost as good. Unlike Lovelife, there's practically no filler here -- it's pure, unadulterated ear candy."
3,Ok....,"this is an Ok cd... its definatly not as good as the older stuff by them... at this point, it was basically just J mascis doing everything, scince he got mad at lou barlow and hit him wiht his guitar.. that was obviously a dumb move, cuz lou really added to the band... there are some good tracks her, though, like the mystical ""out there"" and ""get me"" is a great song too. except for the annoying female vocals on the chorus... ""start choppin"" is an awsome song that sounds alot like third eye blind's ""semi charmed life""... but if you want to pay for a few good songs and alot of filler, go ahead and buy this. but if you want an album that is jamm-packed wiht mind blowing dinosaur jr. tracks, get either their self-titled debut, or ""youre living all over me"". ""bug"" is supposed to be good too, but i havnt heard it."
2,Great Book - Sad Hypocrite,"Great book ... I agree with the positive reviews listed below. But check out Martindale-Hubbel law directory. You'll see that Cameron Stracher never worked a day of his life in a law firm! After graduating from law school, he assumed a professorship at the University of Iowa. Then he worked at CBS. So much for the ""personal"" insights of his time at C & C."
2,Less Than The Sum Of Its Parts,"To find a stellar cast such as this assembled on one recording, one would expect stellar performances. Well, you better sit down...I wanted to like this CD, but I find it difficult to endure to the end. There are some truly wince-inducing moments to be had here. I mean, every musician has a bad night or three, but surely to gawd, over the course of a tour, there had to be some better versions of these songs than those presented. In fact, I can't believe some of these artists allowed these performances to be released.Joe Walsh singing Desperado? Simon Kirke singing Paul Rodgers tunes? Come on. I suppose I should just be glad that Ringo didn't attempt to sing The Long and Winding Road.To be fair there are some decent (even good) performances on this CD.You just need to be prepared for some major league sorting.Good luck."
2,Need to stop letting 3rd rate fantasy writers write STAR WARS!,"This book is ALMOST an entertaining read. When we're not focusing on bugs, it's fine. When we're not focusing on whiny Solo-kids, it's great.Sadly, both of the above figure prominently in this series. Whoever thought the whole idea of joiner-jedi was a good idea needs to be beaten with a bug-mandible. Words canNOT describe the pain involved in reading about Jaina and Zekk.Of course, this is what happens when you let authors like Troy Denning, Aaron Allston and Kevin J. Anderson play in your world. I'm not sure if Star Wars is salvageable at this point, but the folks in charge need to get some better talent on these books!"
1,Troy Denning. Teaching Authors how NOT to write SW books.,After the New Jedi Order series....the Dark Nest trilogy is not just a feeble attempt to retcon everything about it.It's a horribly writtten attempt.If you want to know exactly how not to write a SW-EU Series.I don't think you can get any better than this.Troy Denning has outdone himself when it comes to having a complete lack of literary style.Exposition? Pacing? Well Developed plots and characters?Troy Denning says Who needs 'em.This trilogy is so horrible that I have a permanent cognitive dissonance about it's existence in the EU.
5,Who Gives a *beep* what the price is buy this book,"I found this book on accident and couldn't put it down for days. Anyone w/ an open mind and a love for poetry must read this book. Kaufman not only included some of the best radical poetry in america, but also goes through great pains to make sure the reader is educated on the authors and the poems back grounds."
2,Rather dull,"Of the 3 SACDs available from Cal this is the least desirable. No where near the vibrancy of the Cal/Stan Getz Sextet disc. If you like the ""smooth jazz"" format of contemporary Muzak you may like this. This album was recorded in 1979 vs. 1958 for the Sextet album. Latin + Jazz is the second best disc, this a weak third."
5,"Dreamship , Lullabies for Little Ones","My two daughters and I listen to this beautiful Cd all the time. I often listen to it alone, because it has such great and relaxing music. I greatly recommend it to anyone of any age."
3,"Well built, but will they use it?","This is a solid and well-made cat scratcher, however, only one of my two cats very occasionally uses it. What they use much more is a vertical cat scratcher I bought at the same time I bought this one. (I was trying to preserve my carpeting.)Just a hunch on my part, but I think vertical posts are more appealing to cats."
2,"Great in theory, poorly executed.","I agree that this book proves that chefs don't always make great writers. It has some terrific spots, but is mostly very dry and dull reading. I only read about 1/3 of the book before skipping around to different sections. Perhaps a real pastry chef in the making would enjoy it more, but it certainly isn't an easy read."
2,"Bound, low-quality photocopies.","DO NOT waste your money on this horrible, black and white reproduction. Can someone explain the picture of the castle on the cover?"
1,Horrible Disc,The Disc was read incorrect on all of my DVD players. It was basically just a blank DVD with a picture . I will never buy from the seller Again .
5,Great for Learning,"My son is two and has learned so much from this DVD. He enjoys mixing his own colors now and knows just which colors to put together to get a new color. And he's learned new shapes that he didn't know before (and it's just cute to hear him try and say ""trapezoid""). As with any show my child watches, I watch with him and we talk about it all. He learns so much more that way. The fact that he enjoys the show makes it fun for both of us."
4,Not a Bad First Experience,"Having moved overseas when my son was 8 months old, I have been pretty oblivious to what Blue's Clues was. Now that he's 18 months, I ordered this DVD to help him learn about shapes and colors. It's not a bad introduction to the world of Blue's Clues. I remember baby sitting children during the hey-days of Barney and I found Blue's Clues much more palatable. As for my son, he loves it and bops around to the songs and watches the guy as he names the shapes. It does keep his interest so definitely a winner."
1,not a good first attempt,"Gotham Diaries was a slow and painful read. They told a story, drawing the outline, but never really painting the picture. It was neither descriptive nor imaginative.The main character, Lauren, was a total bore. They wrote her up in this pathetic victim role, but not once did I feel for her, empathize with her. She was beyond naive; she was plain stupid. The small glimmering hope was that in the end she would evolve and learn something, but they dashed and mutilated that one opportunity to redeem the book.Manny was the one character with which I sympathized and they totally scapegoated and reemed him. He is the only character that popped amongst the one-dimensional cast. He made great observations and had the only deep introspective moments, but they shafted his growth in a failed attempt to make Lauren, Ms. Victim, look better.The ending was as bad as the rest of the book. The characters were in the exact same place they started."
2,Mildly Entertaining...Extremely Disappointing,"This is a quick ""beach"" read and nothing more. It appears as though a few choice words were selected as the ""Vocabulary"" and utilized throughout the book in hopes of making it appear an ""intelligent"" read. The scenes are thin because the authors failed to maximize on the ""Gotham"" backdrop. They also offered little insight into the true inner workings of the black bourgeois except for the usual stereotypes. The plot is weak, the characters lack depth and the book overall is deficient of substance. I purchased the book at a B&N and expected a better editing job for the money I spent. My rating of two out of five stars is generous. I expected better."
3,Three-plus stars,"This book was a reasonably breezy read. The Manny character was developed extremely well. The Tandy character was drawn rather well also, but I would have liked to see her at the end, the way I got to learn Manny's feelings about taking the action he'd been forced into. I couldn't really connect with either Lauren or Ed. Ed just struck me as a cold fish. I would have liked to have seen his feelings at the end, too, so I could figure out the odds on the marriage surviving.I can't put my finger on why Lauren seemed to distant to me. I did like the way the authors painted her as moving cautiously forward by the book's end (rather than the everything's-just-dandy-now scenario, and I loved what she did to Tandy. The book read smoothly, always a concern for me when there are co-authors.All in all, not a bad way to spend reading time."
3,Lonely at the Top (GottaBReading),"While it wasn't the best written novel, the characters were lively and explosive. The authors left you with the feeling that when you're wealthy, there's really no one you can trust. The action was slow in the beginning and the twists didn't play out as well as they could (Lauren catching Ed etc), but I liked the coming of age of both Lauren and Manny. They walked away from their experiences a lot wiser than they began. I would definitely buy a sequel."
2,If at first you don't succeed.....,I found this book very difficult to finnish. It started out pretty interesting however by the second/third chapter it became very hard to finnish. The characters were given great introductions however they were not fully developed until the very end. I would say the beginning and the ending of the book was great.If you can get to the ending you will be quite pleased. I am sure readers would like to know what Manny and Tandy are doing since their betrayal to Lauren. I understand that this book could be made into a series somewhat like Soul Food. If so it would be a mega hit!!!
2,I Didnt Get It???,"I didnt completely understand this movie. I had a vague idea of what was happening but can't say that I completely understood everything 100% by the end. That said, one of the best ever mystery films happens to be another French film titled Roman de Gare. Absolutely terrific from start to finish. Many plot twist but written well enough for you to keep up."
3,Dont's expect too much and you'll love the book!,"This book was bought for my 3 yr old daughter. She likes to sit and listen to very long stories. I love the Wizard of Oz movie, but I love the novel even more. I thought the actual story would be more lengthy. Don't be fooled, 50% of this product is illustrations. I actually did not care for the illustrations. I think the colors are beautiful but very dramatic and scary art work. Not for a young child. I'm not impressed with the book or it's story. I give it 3 stars because I expected the story to be longer and better written, and the illustrations to be a secondary feature of the book. If you really want to read it, I recommend checking this one out of the library."
5,Perfect for California travel,Gives you just enough detail one needs to travel within California. Greater detail for metros and not so much for long streches of freeways. I have been using it for years. I had to buy the new one with the latest updates. Do like the new spiral binding as well.
3,"Practical, but with some flaws","I found it pretty annoying that there is no overlap between pages - if a place is located very close to the edge of one page, you cannot find it on another page. Therefore, figuring out, how to get there is very hard. They could create some overlaps between pages, like Michelin atlases always do, instead of wasting page space on ocean areas.I wish Michelin had a road atlas of California."
1,Very poor book -- techniques are silly and projects are ugly,"If you liked Kennedy and Varrell's good first book, you'll be very, very disappointed with this one. They seemed to use up their good ideas in the first book (which is unfortunately out of print). It is a shame that the names are similar, which is confusing, since the books are so very different. Don't pay attention to the number of ""stars"" as ratings because the authors rated their own book, and gave them themselves 5 stars (of course)."
1,This Stinks,"Hmmm...maybe the lazy parent should have just bought the Bratz set their child wanted and just said no to the car!I got this for Christmas by mistake and it went back right away.Price and toy quality certainly show. My Scene pratically worships teens, everything you read on them says their ""real"" teenagers!WHO CARES! This is not how a real teen or pre-teen acts or certainly dresses! Its a typical stereo type that is offencive. Bratz are much more in the teen scene for many reasons but mostly since they don't parade around stating their teens.My Scene copies everything Bratz did. Its good for a liitle kids I guess since this what their used to. I mean now kids have Lizzie Maguire and Raven who care only about boys and hair being teenagers to look after , and are buisy with their boyfriends when their 9 since their parents constantly work.Its sad to kno what they see. Anyway, it's like my mom always says,""It's just another Barbie Doll .....""."
2,TOO SMALL! I wish it were bigger and more durable....,"I recieved this for Christmas and have only played with it once because it got boring.The furniture takes up WAY too much room. Also, Nolee (the doll that comes with the Sound Lounge) is taller than the Sound Lounge itself! The little coffee table that comes with it is sopposed to store CD's, but it falls apart, scratches your CD's big time and I can NEVER get it to close!"
3,Could have been better...,"This was a somewhat fun toy; the lights were really cool and the ""idea"" of the sound lounge was brillant. Although the durability factor of the item was absolutly horrible! Even if you take it out and put it back in a closet gentley and carfully; something will break off. A common part to have durability troubles with is the counter in front of the dancefloor. It's VERY unstable. Also it only comes with 3 pieces of furniture. A chair, A couch ( the legs will commonly fall off), and a table that's a CD holder. The table was a absoule dreadful idea as if you try to put in a Cd it will break right then and there and if you're like me; never will able to fix it."
5,myscene,this toy was the best people say myscene are a clone of bratz but i think it is the other way round. i bought the sound lounge for 11($20) it is better than the barbie items
4,OLD MEMORIES,I HAD LOOKED FOR THIS BOOK FOR A WHILE TO READ TO MY DAUGHTER MY FAVORITE TEACHER READ IT TO US WHEN I WAS IN FOURTH GRADE THE COPY OF THE BOOK WAS IN GREAT CONDITION MR PETERSON SHOULD BE PROUD HIS INFLUENCE OF READING THIS STORY HAS STUCK WITH ME MY DAUGHTER IS ALSO ENJOYING THE STORY
1,More Like A Checklist For Already Organized,"I've been an on-again off-again organized person to complete slob, depending on my life at the moment! Sometimes I just need a guide for getting back on track & purging messes until the house is running smoothly again. This book is made for already organized people to get ultra-organized. It has no heart or soul, just a dull, dry list of reminders. There's also little in the way of staying organized, unless you go back to each list on a daily basis. As much as I think Flylady is the opposite end of the spectrum (made for someone who needs reminding to get dressed in the morning), at least she offers the heart & soul that this book lacks."
3,Cheap parts on an otherwise good wheelbarrow,When I was unpacking the wheelbarrow I was shocked when I came to the fasteners. They were small considering the size of the wheelbarrow. The washers were almost as thin as a soda can. I like that the handles are metal and the wheel has a foam core. The one draw back with the tire is that it does not like to flex to roll over objects like the edge of a sidewalk or a small step.
4,Chris Farley and David Spade makes a Fun Comedic Team.,"A Clumsy Brother (Chris Farley) to a Successful Gubernatorical Candidate of his Older Brother (Tim Matheson). His Younger Brother is Full of Good Intentions but as he Nearly Destory his Sibling's Well Oiled Campaign but the Candidate Hired a Low-Level Aide (David Spade) is assigned to Keep the Likable Klutz Out of Trouble.Directed by Penelope Spheeris (Wayne's World, The Beverly Hillsbillies, The Little Rascals) made a Funny, Sometimes Extrememly Silly and Outrageous Comedy works thanks to Farley's Goofy Comic Performance. This is Farley and Spade's Second Teaming Together since the 1995 Comedy-Tommy Boy. Black Sheep was also a Box Office Hit. Everyone, including Chris Farley's fans will enjoy this. Grade:B+."
3,Was humorous but not as funny as I remember...,I saw this when it first came out and recall it being funnier at the time. Probably because Farley was in his prime then.
4,More Zany Antics from Chris Farley,"Chris Farley proved himself on Saturday Night Live that he was a comedic genius. While he made a big screen name for himself in ""Tommy Boy,"" he fares just as funny in ""Black Sheep.""It's a real treat to watch him on screen; even if some of his comedic bits are a bit sophmoric and just an extension of what he did on television, it's almost impossible not to like what he does."
2,Revised opinion,"Although published in 2003, I actually wrote the bulk of this book much earlier. I am now generally skeptical of many of the not-yet (perhaps, never will be) approved apparitions/seers in this book. The Church has final authority in such matters, and I submit to her eventual decision, either pro or contra. However, some apparitions/seers have been given approval by their local Bishops, such as Betania and Akita, and I would say that they have been de facto approved, if not yet fully promulgated, by the Church.I now realize--more so than I did when I wrote the book--that miracles, seers, mystics etc. are a sometimes, nay, ofttimes dicey subject. ""Signs and wonders"" aren't always from God. Yet such authentic apparitions as Lourdes and Fatima are such an outpouring of the grace of God that it is to our detriment to ignore them, especially in this increasingly materialistic and hedonistic world.Ad Jesu per Mariam!"
5,Great scale,"I love the scale. It was recommended to me by a trainer at the gym and she was right. It was the best buy of these scales for the money and it really helps to give me that extra push. It helps me to determine all aspects of my weight, not just overall weight."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this scale for accuracy, the readings change every second, not very helpful, don't waste your money for the other fancy readings on this scale, just buy one that will give you your weight"
3,"Broken displays not a fluke, manufacturing defect","Firstly, I love this scale. Even if those who argue that some of the numbers other than weight are not meaningful the scale measures how those number change accurately and to me that is also meaningful. BUT a week after i bought the first one the display cracked. Amazon shipped a new one no questions asked. 30 days after that the display cracked on the new one. Again its being replaced but twice cannot be a fluke, given that other reviews here also mention the same cracked display problem it seems clear to me that the digital display is not sufficiently engineered to absorb even light shock from banging."
2,Lack of Character Development,"The premise of this book sounded great but because there was a lack of character development it was hard to understand what motiviated some of the characters. The author went overboard in her description of every single detail of the cruise and the settings instead of focusing more on the characters. There was also an overabundance of primary characters making it hard to keep track of who was who. I thought the book was okay, but would have a hard time recommending it to others."
2,Okay read,This book sounded very interesting with the whole first black cruise ship idea. There were too many characters and too much sex that had nothing to do with the plot. I thought the characters should have been more developed and some should not have been included as main characters at all. The style the book was written in was quite confusing and I would not recommend this book for a good read.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,My son's TV shuts it self off within 2 seconds of turning it on! This seems to be a common problem and Disney should be ashamed!
1,Huge flaw - keeps shutting itself off,Length:: 0:29 MinsThis TV shuts itself off after a few seconds. Same problems as everyone else here. Had it for about a year and then it started all of a sudden. First I thought it was ghosts. Now I know it is just a bad product.This is obviously due to a design issue. I'm sure that some engineer messed up when calculating how big of a heat sink they need to prevent some part from melting on the circuit board. Whoops.Disney should be ashamed of the embarrassment this is to their products division and issue a recall.
1,Poor Choice,I purchased this TV last XMAS for my grandkids. I am having the same issues. Cuts on and off by its self. It is no longer working at all. I would not recommend this TV to anyone.
1,"cute, but not worth it",Product only has 90 day warranty--go figure. Not made to last. DVD player barely lasted 6 months.
1,Horrible!,"We bought this tv 4 months ago and now it won't stay on. It just turns itself off after a couple minutes. The warranty was for 90 days and therefore, we're 1 month out of warranty. Disney was no help, telling us the tv was no longer in production and we should take it to a repair shop. The repair shop said it would be about $150 to fix. Absolutely a ripoff!"
1,Disaster,"I agree with Kelly's review. The surface is smooth and polished. The handles, lid and container, cannot be grasped even wwith a towel. Terrible problem when hot."
5,Excellent review book,"Excellent review book for exams in UK; both MRCOphth and MRCS. Very well written, up-to-date (with all major studies) and concise. NOT to be used as first or only book. Should be read, initially, along with a major text, say, Kanski and should be read well before exam. 'Exam Tips' and 'Clinical Approach....' sections are extremely useful. I have recommended this book to half a dozen of my friends and they all loved it. No section on conjunctiva though."
5,A Wonderful Gift,"The Walker, Texas Ranger (First Season) DVD collection made a wonderful Christmas gift for my grandmother. She just loved it, and to be able to watch the entire season in one sitting was the best. The shipping time was wonderful as well. It was kind of a last minute gift, and it couldn't have arrived at a better time!"
5,Great Reference Book,"I was required to buy this for school (about 6 years ago), but I still have it in my library."
1,James T. Kirk will return!!!!!!!,"This is by far my least favorite of the Star trek movies. The plot is stupid, a man is trying to get back to la la land and dosen't care how many people he kills in the process. Also they bring back Captain Kirk to kill him so he was just kind of thrown in there, he is not relevant to the story. Kirk's death is not at all worthy, he falls and is buried by some rocks. His supposed death on the Enterprise B was much better than his actual one. I wouldn't hate this movie so much if William Shatner's book The Return had been made into a movie right after (if you have not read it I highly recomend that you do). But if you must kill Kirk do it RIGHT or better yet don't kill him at all!!!"
3,Fun moments but a little too dark overall,"This one is worth seeing for the ceremony as Worf recieves his promotion and to see the snafus as Kirk, Scott and Chekov try desperately to command a news crew as all heck breaks loose (as usual) during a test cruise of a new Enterprise in the past. Alas the rest of the film is a bit too dark and grim. It aches and lacks some of the ability to laugh at itself that set apart the best of its predecessors (namely ""Search for Spock"" and ""Voyage Home"". It felt too much like an overlong STNG episode. And even then ""Relics"" was better. Oh well, guess I just have a softer spot for Scott than Kirk!"
2,Why'd it get pulled?,"I was looking forward to adding this to my collection of other Special Edition Trek films, but suddenly it was pulled.The only reason to purchase this is for the extras, the film itself is horrid. This outing is filled with schlock that looks like it was thrown together at the last minute...mismatched uniforms, re-using the same footage from The Undiscovered Country, Kirk's lame death scene. Data, of course, ruins the film with his hammy acting...thanks to an ""emotion"" chip. Still beating a dead horse I see!"
5,Lost in the mail,"Over 3 weeks. Did not receive item. Contacted seller. It was lost in the mail. Got a refund & ordered from another seller, (the first seller no longer had it in stock). Got it yesterday & watched it last night."
4,Storyline - No. Action - AH YEAH!,"I was totally amazed after watching Generations the 1st time. I didn't think once about the actual story for I was so drawn into the action scenes and special effects. This is good for you get to see how the Enterprise D is destroyed, er, disabled you could say. Being nearly blown apart by a Klingon vessel, then punched by an exploding shocked wave, followed by crashing onto a planet is good action if I ever seen any. Now for the story line. Upon watching the film over and over, I began to focus on storyline. Not that great. It's good they reunitd the 2 captains, but the way they did it seems almost as if the creators ""just threw something together"" to make it happen. Kirk's death is wierd. He dies for a good cause, to save millions. But the ""Oh my"" as his final words, whatever that means. Overall, get this. The action is too good to miss."
2,How could they make this movie?,What a terrible script this movie had. It's astonishing they actually produced it. One of the most glaring things about it was the use of the Nexus. Plot-holes galore. A disappointing team-up between Shatner and Stewart. Another annoying thing is the lack of consistency--note the uniform changes every five minutes.
3,Mr. Tricorder,"The 7th movie of the Star Trek films is perhaps the worst movie of all. Now, some people might say that Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is the worst movie of the Trek movies. But, they're wrong.The Enterprise-B is carrying three members of the aging ""classic Trek"" characters; Capt. Kirk, Scotty and Chekov. The Enterprise-B does a rescue on ships trapped in The Nexus. The Enterprise-B is badly damaged, and Kirk is presumed dead. But, Kirk is just living happily back at his house on Earth within the Nexus.The story is the worst of the movies. The only thing that saved the moive--for me--is the subplot about Data's emotion chip."
4,Generation Next?,"After All Good Things . . . We travel back to the 23rd century. Kirk, Scott, and Chekov are honored guests aboard the enterprise NCC-1701B. Kirk is believed killed, and we head back to the 24th century. A whole plot with the nexus isn't great, but we get some important lore; Data's Emotion Chip, the death of the Duras Sisters, and the destruction of the Enterprise NCC-1701D.Since the TOS episode, Tomorrow is Yesterday, Star Trek was sometimes able to predict the future. For those who don't know, they knew what weekday the moon landing would fall and they knew when an important assignation would take place. This one predicted that Scotty, James Doohan, would get alzheimers. For the prologue is before the Episode Relics, and there Scotty didn't know about Kirk's fate . . ."
3,a long episode,"I will say this. If I had to pay 15 bucks or go to a theatre to see this film I wouldn't do it. However for the 5-6 bucks you are about to pay for it then yes it's worth it. It was a movie that should have never went to theraters but, been on a tv.It might as well been a two part eps with a bigger budget. Granted I like the movie and bought it on amazon and if you like TNG you'll like this film."
3,Average Trek flick...,"This fun, hokey attempt by the corporate hacks at Paramount to pass the torch from the old, dying original Trek Geezers to the Next Gen works well enough, but its plot is rather weak, and the old vs. new conundrum soaks up energy that one would have hoped would have gone into plot and character development. There are a lot of funny moments here, some unintentional. The old cast really seems to enjoy themselves, while the Next Gen seems to take themselves, and this rather fanciful story, a bit too seriously."
3,Generations has its moments,"It would be more accurate to rate this film at 3 1/2 stars. The long awaited meeting of the two captains of the Enterprise is weighed down by an overly complicated plot involving a mad scientist (played with scene chewing delight by Malcom McDowell), Data receiving emotions, and Klingon renegades. The charm and charisma of the Next Generation players is not nearly as evident here as in the next two films. On the bright side, Generations has its moments which still make it a very worthwhile and intellegent film. William Shatner steals the show in his last outing as ""Captain James T. Kirk"", and the interplay between he and Stewart is great. Also, the special effects are top-notch, particularly the crash landing of the Enterprise. Generatiion's greatest strength come from its message: treasure every moment of one's life, because it will never come again. It's worth a look, despite it's structural flaws. Also, these DVD's should be loaded with EXTRAS. There are none here."
1,Really? Billy needs to do better.,"I have many taebo tapes and this one is the worst. You can't even select let's say 4 of the eight workouts then take them. You have to do them one on one. This is a cheap video. The people look tired in the video and the even Shelly doesn't seem to be as energized. No one knew what Billy was doing even the people in the video. It is so no taebo like for part of the videos. It was like he ran out of money, made this video with people who half heartedly were doing the moves. The people looked tired is all I can say. This was a waste of money. For a real taebo video check out the ultimate taebo. Billy has got to do better in the future if he wants to keep his following.What a disappointment. I will think twice about the next video."
5,Exactly as I remember,Introducing the story to my children. Great book. Exactly as listed. Couldn't be more pleased. Teaches a lesson in doing one's chores.
4,"Gritty and Real, Not for the Faint of Heart","As a teen worker I found this be a useful guide into the minds of teens. It didn't surprise me as much as it confirmed or validated my experiences working with teens. Be warned, if you are not ready to hear the truth in graphic detail, then this book is not for you. But, if you have an open mind, a caring heart and a willingness to really understand teens then this book is a must!"
3,Funny and informative!,"This book is funny because it's on the dummy level. Read it and laugh! At nearly 600 pages it has lots of good information that is not tabloid. The pet section has common dangers to cats like ""The warm and deadly dryer: Some cats have been killed after their owners have accidentally closed and turned on a dryer with a sleeping cat inside. Prevention in simple. Keep the door closed...always check for your cat."" See what I mean. It's funny and informative. Now really is anyone going to be so stupid as to turn on the dryer and not hear the cat noisily thrashing inside and ignore its loud cries. They are either deaf or I don't think it would be accidental. Headlines and highlights make easy reading. At least 3 stars."
5,Excellent,"Over the years, movies like ""Deliverance"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and ""Wrong Turn"" have turned the 'evil hillbilly' into a well recognized sub-genre of horror. But did anyone ever stop to think that maybe the evil hillbillies were victims? Maybe they were just fighting back against the evil city folk wreaking havoc in their front yards! ""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"" is a creative spin on this sub-genre of horror, similar to how ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Zombieland"" portrayed a more comedic side of the zombie sub-genre. Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine were fantastic as the good-intentioned and lovable Tucker and Dale, and the actors/actresses playing the college kids were easy to hate. Ultimately, if you want a good laugh, don't mind a moderate amount of gore, and enjoy some action and romance, this is the movie for you."
5,great,"I cant spoil it, but it was pretty entertaining, it was definitely what you should expect it to be, that is funny and a satire."
4,Good and silly,"I saw this film and I wasn't expecting much. When the film started I almost turned it off because I could see where it was going and it didn't look good....I decided to give it a few more minutes and I'm glad I did! The film is silly and predictable, but charming and very clever. It is by no means a great film but I have to admire it for doing something so many horror comedies fail to do..make me laugh. It made me laugh and I watched the entire movie. It's short, but that's a good thing.If you like horror comedies this is one to check out. It's good silly fun with great over the top gore!"
4,MY GRADE: B.,"Unlike other horror films this one spins it another direction with the question: what if the hillbillies were the victims of misunderstandings and prejudiced perceptions? What follows is a comedy horror taking potshots at all the typical horror hillbilly spoof stereotypes. Everything that goes comically wrong does go comically wrong and the hillbillies (Tucker and Dale, of course) are blamed. I'm tempted to list some funny examples but I try to avoid spoilers typically.Notable people include Alan Tudyk, Tyler Labine, Katrina Bowden.[5] and Brandon Jay McLaren (before I first saw him in ""The Killing"" TV series).On a scale I'd say this is funny but probably a couple of notches down from my all time favorite ""Shaun of the Dead"". The Box Office for this picture was a bit over $4M but I've yet to see an official budget report.HUMOR WITH HORROR: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; WHEN WATCHED: end of May 2012 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B."
5,good mix of humor and b-budget horror,"Tucker & Dale is a fresh mix of humor and b-budget horror. We laughed and made exclamations repeatedly. Set in the woods, as all good slashers are, a young group of people meet of a couple of hicks and the blood begins to flow. Oh, and how many times can a young lady get knocked out before she begins to get suspicious? That is why she makes a good morph to a hick."
5,How did i not hear about this sooner?,"I decided to watch this movie on a whim and from the very start was happy with my decision. This was one of the best satires I have seen in that last 5, maybe 10 years. As I do not wish to reveal much i will say that this movie kept me engaged throughout, while providing plenty of very hearty laughs. This is definitely not a family film, but if you do not mind some blood then you will really enjoy this movie."
3,very differnt,the only thing i can say about this movie is i dont think i ever seen a movie set up like this one...im not saying this movie is good cause its really kinda stupidbut if u got some time and money to wast check it out...
3,Charming comedy falls to cliche,"Just to put it out there: this is much more comedy than horror. The two main actors are absolutely great, and I would love to see these guys take the roll of Two Funny Dudes that Nick Frost and Simon Pegg chose to drop. When the movie is focused on Tucker and Dale, it shines. It's homages to some of the classic horror flicks will leave you rolling, but the rest of the film is horribly, horribly generic and cliche PG-13 summerfest. If you are looking for a genuinely good horror comedy, please spend your money on the much more deservingMurder Party. A full review at MediaMongrel.net."
5,Brilliant Social Satire,"Having grown up around people like Tucker and Dale this movie perfectly illustrated how stupidly society has brainwashed people into believing that someone such as these two characters have to have come from some kind of ""Deliverance"" background. From beginning to end this movie had me LAUGHING! Great, great film!"
4,"Well written, funny, well-paced movie","Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a parody movie on a budget. It's well paced and well edited. Gory, in a cartoon kind of way, that is not particularly repulsive. I'll probably watch it again. The 4+ star review score is deserved. Lot of fun for this genre of movie."
4,MOS rock,"Ok, the MOS write cool keyboardy pop songs with fun vocals... The key word here is fun. Ok, they aren't Radiohead, the other reviews who gave one star need to feel music and not come into something expecting things. They weren't ready for the Mates of State. They rule!"
2,One awesome song...,"I can't believe that none of these reviews mention the song ""Cursed Female"". I loved that track. That song alone is worth the purchase of this album. But as far as I am concerned, it's the only memorable thing on this disc. The rest of the tunes aren't horrible, but they really aren't worth your time."
4,Some good stuff!!!,"This debut by PORNO FOR PYROS is really good...MEIJA, SADNESS, CURSED FEMALE, PORNO FOR PYROS and the mega hit PETS are among the best songs Perry Farrell ever recorded..."
1,I DON'T CARE,"DOn't care if it is good or not. Compilations are horrible. The only intention of this album is to make fast money. The formula is old: an old band or solo asrtist comes back after years of reclusion or commercial breakdown. What does he do ? Release a new studio studio album followed fast by a live album: see recent exmaples: JUDAS PRIEST (JUGULATOR followed by LIVE MELTDOWN), IRON MAIDEN (BRAVE NEW WORLD followed by a live album that is already on production) and so on and on. Blergh !"
5,a rare find,"Stories for the sharp, intelligent reader. La Valle's writing is jolting in its vibrance, and touching in its warmth."
3,Early Moorcock Doesn't Impress,"Written under a pen-name, this grade-C adventure SF takes place on Mars. It feels like a by-the-numbers imitation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars books-- though you may be amused by his references to other authors (their names are spelled backwards) in the first ten pages. Moorcock has written dozens of books worth reading-- this is at the bottom of the heap."
3,Jhaeman's Review,"Michael Moorcock's Masters of the Pit is the third and final book featuring modern-day American Michael Kane traveling to ancient Mars. It's very much in line with the first two books in the series, and by this point the cardboard nature of the characters and repetitive action scenes start to become quite noticeable. The plot is somewhat original, as a plague has affected a distant city in a strange way: its inhabitants decide to dehumanize themselves by acting as mechanically and unemotionless as possible. Kane, along with his reliable blue giant friend Hool Haji, sets off to find a cure by rummaging the abandoned technology of an ancient culture. It's all a competent but not particularly memorable mix of sword-and-sorcery fantasy with a little sci-fi. Keep a close eye fun in Chapter One, as Moorcock uses thinly-disguised character and location names to attack Analog magazine and some of the big names in the field."
5,I Couldn't Put it Down,I read Healing Noelle in one sitting... no joke. The plot moves so quickly it has you living it. Mike has done a fantastic job -- putting the reader right in the thick of controversy surrounding medical advancements and the will of God. Definite movie potential.
1,Not a good dive light,Purchased two of these lights for a recent dive trip. Max depth was 106 ft. Both lights leaked during first dive........one actually exploded on return to surface.The single o ring seal does not seem to hold up under high pressure.I would not recommend these for serious divers.
4,A bird's eye view of everything Dansk.,"Had the perfect blend of pictures and history. Could have had a wider shopping section (like something other than clothes, you know), but that's no different from all other guide books."
4,"DK,s Denmark...Fabulous","DK,s Denmark, aside from Copenhagen this is a complete and colourful guide that helps bring Denmark to life...Not that the Danish are short of Life but it allows the outsider to creep in and enjoy. A companion guide that simultaneously allows one to find those cosy spots. Don't leave without it, essential travelling assistant."
3,Lindsey's Later Albums Are Much Better,"This album will likely appeal to fans of Fleetwood Mac's mellower side, but after the exhilarating ride Lindsey gave us on Tusk, this album seems like a retreat. In Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey's songs tended to rock harder and have more energy and spunk than those of the two ladies. But there is little of that energy and spunk in evidence here. It's all very pleasant, but I found it a disappointment. Still, several songs stand out - Trouble, Shadow Of The West, Johnny Stew, and Love From Here, Love From There. My one word review of this album is ""Mild"". I liked his later solo albums much more."
2,What a disappointment!,"I remember when Trouble came out, I thought it was such a great song- then I got Law And Order- what a mess! This is something Lindsey should have made for his friends- as exoerimental as some of his stuff was on Tusk, this is way beyond that- some songs are unlistenable to me- pass it by-"
3,"Hefty and nice, but..","The ends of the handles were not rounded enough to be comfortable. From the pictures I thought the ends would be more ""bulbous"" and rounded. They had slightly flat and edgy ends that just somehow did not fit into my hands well. The weight of the flatware was substancial, and the quality admirable. I only wished they had made it more rounded at the ends so it wouldn't feel so ""deflated"" and somewhat ""unbalanced."" It would have been THE flatware set for me. YMMV. These are my humble $.02"
4,Boyfriend LOVED it!,A great movie at a great price! It's one of my boyfriends favorite movies so I got it for him for Christmas. He's watched it a few times already and now my son is borrowing it. Well worth the price! Plus it has an entire disc of special features - something many movies aren't bothering to do anymore. Chris Farley and David Spade at their best!
1,You know how REALLYY bad movies are kinda funny?,"Well, not this one. It's just stupid. A waste of money(mine), time(again, mine), space(on the video store shelf), and electricity (required to play the worthless trash). Seriously, this should appear on Mystery Science Theater 3000 so at least the wisecracking Tom Servo could salvage somthing from this piece of garbage. The fat guy is supposed to be a stupid, but lovable moron that somehow manages to save all the jobs in town. Yawwwwwn."
2,Waste of time,I had time to kill so thought this movie would help. It was a waste of time. The actors tried to hard to be funny.
4,solid information,"This book does not work on the specific details of algorithms. If it did, it would be quickly outdated. Instead, this book is based on the fundamental concepts of the web. As search engines get more advanced, they will be more able to emulate the end user.This book is simple and straightforward. Another positive part of this book is that it overlaps other issues a little to help you understand that there is more to a website than search engine marketing.This book does not cover in detail some of the wordarounds for dynamic website configurations. Other than that its a good book. I believe those intersted in dynamic workarounds were not the target audience for this book anyway."
2,past its prime,"I have a feeling in its day this was an amazing book... it's not to say you won't pick up a new tip or learn something, but since the book came out in January 2003, so to say a few things have changed in the world of search engines is being generous... it's an easy read, well written and still has a place on your book shelf... you won't be disappointed, but you'll notice a dated feel as you get into it... the book at times is like a walk down memory lane... you'll read references to the once great internet players... hotbot, alta vista and lycos... there are also plenty of references to a possible up and coming search engine called Google... it's worth reading, but it is a bit out dated"
4,General info is great,"The specifics are outdated in this book, but well worth the purchase price for the general principles that will probably remain timeless.Decent layout/structureGreat for a total SEO novice"
4,The Wild West in Glorious Black and White!!!,"It is wonderful to be able to watch these episodes again, frankly a couple I don't remember ever seeing. I have been suprised how well the show has held up after 40 years. While as an actor Robert Conrad pushes his ""Leading Man"" position a bit, it should be noted that was the style of the time (i.e. William Shatner). The series as a whole is a somewhat ""campy"", admittedly thats half the fun. In many ways it is Americas answer to the Britsh ""Avengers""! Having watched the 1st season what I really noticed is how orginal, intelligent and well written the scripts are. I also love the music and framing of each (act?)commerical break with the Sketch art motif. Yes I agree the series is not historically accurate, but I still contend it is likely plausible in terms of fiction. Finally there are the guess star villians each episode, will anyone forget Michael Dunn as Miguelito Loveless."
5,Great Show!,"I won't go into a lot of details because plenty other people have, but it is a very enjoyable western. It has been redone excellent on DVD; it is clear and the sound is great etc. I would recommend it!"
4,The Wild Wild West: Very enjoyable viewing!,"This is a great collection of the first season of The Wild Wild West show. There are seven discs in the set. On the back of each case, there is a short description of each show. There are also small bonus features such as audio introductions by Robert Conrad, an audio interview with John Kneubuhl (writer, created Dr. Loveless), and an interview (audio) with the producer. The quality of the DVDs is very good. I would recommend it."
4,Good buy,The hoop is much nicer than I expected its real wood. I bought a different canopy for my 2 year old daughter and I expected similar quality with this one but this one exceeded my expectations. I read a few reviews about the large packaging it comes in and that's an understatement. The box is HUGE I could easily fit into it and the canopy comes flat packed with the hoop. Very strange packaging but now we have a large box for Christmas.
5,fabulous,"This cannopy is for my grandson's cribb'S decoration. Of course it was too long for the purpose. I trimmed off, put ribbon all around it, and it just looks FABULOUS. Thank you for this great product. Dalma"
1,American Greats,"The only thing ""Great"" in the book is The Corvette and The Coca-Cola Recipe by Christopher Buckley.The cover is real nice as shown on Amazon with Different pictures one with the 1957 Corvette SS,which is the Corvette in the pictures.The copy I read was checked out from the library.The book itself,FDR'S fireside Chats? You mean the Same FDR who lied about his Health? Sold out Poland to Stalin?and was Soft On Communism in government?(Just like his successors Truman and Then Ike). An American Great would Be Democracy,Anti-Communism, National Review,and Just plain Simple America.According to the authors these were ""Selected"" essays by contributors.Well,The ""Compilers"" could have added many other things,Sure Enough America never has to excuse herself,Because In my Opinion America is Great even if this book cannot Examine that at a deeper level."
5,Wonderful read aloud,"My 1st grader thoroughly enjoyed this book being read to him, he found Measle's dog hilarious. We have just bought the next two, Measle and the Dragodon, Measle and the Mallockee."
1,Custom Rod Thread Art,This is a hardback book with a brightly colored exterior. Every page on the inside is ... black and white. I don't see how the author planned to get the detail across to the reader. It makes me want to be more cautious when I buy a book on line.
4,Brings back wonderful memories.,"I order this for my grown children because they used to watch this movie frequently as young children. For mother's day we all sat down and watched it together. Great film, great laughs. Enjoyed it."
5,YOU MUST SEE THIS,"This was my favorite movie as a little kid... and it still is my favorite movie now. Its musical pieces are fun for children and devilishly clever for adults. The insanity of its plot makes me smile endlessly and i still laugh outloud to myself (even though I've seen it so many times) because it is just os quirky and ridiculous, and yet a work or pure genious. This is a timless classic that is good for everyone. Anyone who appreciates Dr. Seuss especially, this is the only movie that he was involved in making and the film epitomizes his style and talent."
3,Okay,"This is a so-so album. The problem with R.E.M. is they have one basic pretty good sound, but they repeat that same sound song after song. The joke of it all is that Michael Stipe says the Beatles were worthless...BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO THE BEATLES' SONG ""RAIN,"" THAT IS R.E.M.'S BASIC SOUND, RIGHT THERE! The vocals, the instruments, everything. Maybe Stipe himself wasn't influenced by the Beatles, but whoever DID influence Stipe/R.E.M. was influenced by the Beatles. And the Beatles ""Rain"" blows away anything R.E.M. did, or ever could do. Listen to ""Rain"" before you buy R.E.M. And then if you're in the mood for second-raters, R.E.M. will fit the bill."
5,incredible album.,"man on the moon was the first song i heard from this album (my first rem song too). that was the song that was responsible for my buying it. and then on the first listen, i discovered drive and everybody hurts and sweetness follows. seven years after buying this album, i still savor every note of music in it - this album is simply awesome."
4,Automatic...,"undoubtedly this is an amazing cd, but for any real REM geek, i wouldnt suggest it. its not their best cd, but for your average fan its still a good one"
3,rem lost it after 86,"This album in no way compares to their first three, and falls well short of document and pagent... i don't know what people hear in this... rem lost their edge and stipe sounds simpy and too soft... to those who think otherwise you are wrong.... listen to murmur and tell me that aftp is even close.... i think not.."
5,a 90s milestone,"well, it's been - what? - seven years now? i guess it has....albums really can't be judged with any sort of accuracy until they've been around for a couple of years at least -- otherwise, the ""newness"" factor has an odd way of interfering with rational judgement: works that seem incredible at first listen sometimes just don't hold up over time. but that's not the case with this enigmatic, beautiful gem of an album. time has proven it to be (apart from the unreal ""murmur"", which is one of the four or five greatest albums of the rock era) r.e.m.'s crowning achievement and easily one of the greatest albums of this decade."
5,REM's third masterpiece,"Well, the last reviewer CLEARLY showed his lack of knowledge on REM or his good taste. So, where to start?REM had hit their high point twice in the past. The first time was MURMUR, an indie rock classic that was influential to many bands. The second time was their commercial breakthrough, DOCUMENT, when a large amount of confused people turned ""The One I Love"" into a hit. Now, AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE has become a melancholy classic.Track by track, this is REM's best album lyrically, and it benefits from the reliance on acoustic instruments. ""Drive"", ""Man on the Moon"", ""Everybody Hurts"", ""The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite"" and ""Nightswimming"" are among REM's best songs. ""Try Not To Breathe"", ""Monty Got A Raw Deal"" and ""Find The River"" are probably REM""s best songs that nobody knows about. If you are an REM fan and you don't own this, buy it as soon as possible."
2,Overrated!!,"I've been reading the reviews and in my opinion this album seems to have been elevated to god-like status from some reason.This album is full of filler and I would place it well behind Reckoning, Fables, and Document. Hell, even 'Chronic Town'is better, and that was only an EP.REM were a great band in the early 80's, but sadly since 'Green' they have went drastically downhill. Instead of being Leaders they are now just followers. There drive to make exciting new music and the pattern starting with Out Of Time has sadly continued.It's a shame realley!!"
2,classic? I think not.,"The book is awful. I get the feeling that the angelou just wants some self pity by gripping about it in her books--the same scene plays over and over: racism , racism, we grew up poor, racism, we grew up poor. I don't doubt that racism was/is a big part of society--but it gets old when people starts yammering and whining about the ethics of racism cuz no one really cares about it anymore."
4,My Review,"I thought that this book was very good and very interesting, but I also felt that there was too much vivid sexual descriptions...I read this book as an assignment for my eighth grade english class, and it was very awkward to discuss some of the chapters. We were even instructed not to read the chapter where she is pondering her sexuality and lesbianity. I think that, as good a book as I found this to be, it was not appropriate for an eighth grade english class....not that its Maya Angelou's fault! well I hope you all enjoyed this book as much as I did..."
1,A book with no point,This book to me a waste of time. It had no significant ending. Why is having the baby a happy ending to this book. In my point of views it just made her life go downhill. And how is ruuning away to the junkyard a good idea. If I were to do that I would be dead. Maya does a good job writing this book but there is no point. She tries to get acroos themes but it fails. She grew up in tough times with much racism. She only sees whie hating blacks. She fails to see that she has a racist point of view of whites. Some details in the scene from St. Louis did not needed to be added. I don't think this is an appropriate book for kids to be forced to read. Kids can't watch some P.G. 13 movies in school. I consider this writing to be rated P.G. 16. My main problem is the book has no ending or point.
4,A Reflection Of Life,"This book I read was a classroom assignment, and I picked this book to read. I really don't like to read, but I'm glad I picked this one up. One thing I liked about this book is the fact that Maya Angelou had to grow up pretty quick. She learned a lot coming, and going. Everything that she wrote about in this book is a part of everyday life. Maya is the main character in this novel. Everything that happens is a reflection on her life. This is a really good book. In some ways it could be very educational to the reader. I would definitely recommend this book to any readers, or non-readers."
1,Terrible,"This book was THE hardest book for me to read simply because it is a terrible book. I would never recommend this book to ANYONE. It would be a cruel torture that I wouldn't wish on even my worst enemy. Her life was so screwed up and she doesn't have good views on things such as white people, sex, or family. And even with the views she has and the things that have happened to her, she goes to the whole world to hear her sick, sad story. keep those things to yourself where they belong and not spread it like a disease to the public."
1,A mediocre and oversensationalized story,"I had to read this book in ninth grade honors English. I thought the book was one more the more profound wastes of time I had ever expended when I was done. Now that I'm in college however, I do not despise the book as much. I still feel that it is of very little value. Had the author been white and not helped along by Ophra, this work would be largely unnoticed. It's just another story about how someone had a rough life... with nothing to differentiate it from all of the other books like it. The reason I have rated it so low is because it seemed to be an agenda setting work. Maya Angelou is black and has used this book to help push her liberal agenda. Again - if Maya Angelou was white and was not well liked by Ophra, the book would have flopped. I would not recommend this at all... especially if you are a conservative."
3,Strong and Confident,"I've heard about this book for years, so I was happy to run across a copy of it in a recent bookbox. In honor of Black History Month, I decided to try it.I would say I liked it. I didn't love it, but parts of it kept me reading along at a nice clip. It's the story of a girl who considers herself ugly and is regarded as ugly by others. She is set aside by her mother and father and later her grandmother and uncle. She suffers from abuse by a step-parent when she was a very young girl. She is a member of the black population during the time that her people are tormented by her white peers. Yet she grows up strong and confident. Parts of the book are poetic and beautifully written."
4,The women in her life,Maya Angelous book is quite an extraordianry one. I would have to say that everyone at one point in thier lives should read this book. I believe that the most extraordinary thing is her triumph with the help of her extraordinary female influences. Maya Angelou is a symbol of one triumphing over adversity.
2,my rating,"in fact, it is a good book but as for myself, i find it too common to compare between maya angelou and other black authors. to be honest, richard wright and richard ellison and maya are in the same category: nothing different.on the other hand, it is a good book anyway."
4,South Mill Young Readers Book Club Review (Jr. High Readers),"We are the members of the South Mill Young Readers Book Club located in Conyers, Georgia. We are in the thirteen year old age bracket and thought it would be challenging to attempt to read and understand this story. As a result of our reading, we rate the book as follows:Creativity - B+Enjoyment - A+Price - B+We would recommend this book to others in our age group to read it.Typed by Book Club Instructor: mwg"
3,It's lovely to look at....,"but the fact of the matter is this: unless you pulverize your salt, the holes on the top do not allow for good salt dispensing. The pepper comes out nicely, however. It provides sleek lines, and a great display - just don't expect to season anything with salt while using this set!"
4,jorge cruise lean hips and thighs,I enjoyed the book and even bought two more of his books. The first chapters with his life story is the same in all the books but when it gets to the body parts its different. The book explains alot about working out and eating well.
5,Stunning...,"It's Shawn Lane. No more should really need to be said. On this album he showed his unbelievable guitar technique, but even more so, he showed his skill in musical composition. Every song, except for West Side Boogie, was written by Shawn Lane. Every instrument was also played by him. Most people, if they know Shawn Lane, know him as a tremendous guitarist. There is no doubt that he was. But he was also an excellent keyboard player. Shawn Lane was quite simply a musician of the absolute highest calibur. He will always be missed."
3,OK,I am a 52 year old woman and heard Aimee Mann singing a song from James Taylor on a rerun of the West Wing. I liked the tone of her voice on that one song on the television show. Bought the CD just to check it out and hear more.She's fine. I assume she will appeal to a younger audience. Maybe I should stick to James Taylor?
2,Over Produced & Under Inspired,"I am a huge Aimee Mann fan. I loved ""Whatever"", so when ""I'm With Stupid"" came out I bought it with eager anticipation. What a difference! The rock and folk of ""Whatever"" are overshadowed by pristine sound and dance oriented production, as well as her songwriting being well below the 1st album's standard. Especially now that Mann has released 2 great albums since, in ""Bachelor #2"" & ""Lost In Space"". She is obviously getting better with age and has become the premiere singer-songwriter of today. She is fantastic and I would recommend any of her albums over ""I'm With Stupid"", really the runt in an otherwise towering solo career.Bachelor No. 2Lost in SpaceWhatever"
4,Par for the Course,"I bought Aimee Mann's album ""I'm With Stupid"" after hearing ""Amateur"" from the Sliding Doors soundtrack. While I still believe that ""Amateur"" is the best of these songs on the CD because of its inventive style mixed with very creative lyrics, after listening to the CD a few times through, other songs such as ""You Could Make a Killing"" and especially ""Choice in the Matter"" are good too. Aimee's approach: a sad realization that love and relationships are made up of people who don't realize always what they are doing, really hits you after song number 4 or so. It's overwhelming in its truth, and Aimee mixes that truth with slow, soft, drilling tunes that catch up with you after a while."
5,Aimee Mann is the best - and she proves it here!,"I'm with Stupid is one of my absolute favorite CDs. It is compulsively playable without being at all trite or cliched. Aimee's music is far from being mindless pop - her lyrics are witty and almost painfully wise - and her music is original and not a little bit wacky. This CD features a more instrument intensive feel then her last CD, and I think it is better for the change. The single ""Long Shot"" is one of the coolest songs in existence, and the rest of the CD is just as wonderful - even the much maligned but in my opinion completely adorable song ""Superball."" Buy it, play it - then just try not to love it."
1,Get Real,"I bought this along with ""Whatever"" after reading about the use of Aimee's music in the soundtrack of ""Magnolia"". Forget the hype, all the songs sound alike and she can't sing."
5,"Someone, Give This Woman A New Contract!","Between ""Whatever"" and this little gem, Aimee Mann proves she has more smarts than a dozen other female singer songwriters combined. But she's gone three years without a new CD release. What's wrong with this picture?? This is a supremely clever album. Oh sure, it sounds very Costello-ish in parts, and she sure is down on her men, but it's a great piece of work. I bought it a year ago, slipped it into a pile of ""should listen to"" CDs, and never did. Then read a profile in the New York Times magazine a few weeks back and jogged my memory. Since then, I've listened to it about 20 times. So will you."
5,Tremendously well-written pop!,"Here's to hoping this woman keeps it up. Writing good, smart pop songs today is like shouting down a deep, empty hole. The wole record kicks a$$, and ""Superball"" is actually a nifty tip of the hat to another great pop writer, Scott Miller of Loud Family/Game Theory(whom all fans of good pop music should chech out.) Looking forward to Ms. Mann's show in Philly. New stuff soon?"
2,It worked ok for a little while,"It works pretty responsively and good but after some use, it becomes totally useless. It's not very durable at all as the plastic cover top will start to rip and the arrow buttons become less responsive so you can't really enjoy the game."
5,Great Movie!,"I saw this movie several years ago and found it exciting with excellent acting! I never understood why it was not given more awards, but would highly recommend it! Do yourself a favor and watch it!!!"
1,Flight of the wrong region,"I know the movie is a great movie. This particular dvd did not work. It attempts to load. Then it tells me ""wrong region."""
5,Love it,Easy to install if you follow the included instructions. I have a multimeter which helps identify the hot (black) wire. You need a neutral and ground as the instructions specify.It is nice to be able to control lights from my computer and schedule them to go on instead of walking down the stairs in the dark.The Micasaverde Vera is like a robot in my house turning lights on and off as well as controlling my schlage thermostat.
2,There are better!,"I have tried several pregnancy DVDs, and this one is the worst. This is terribly repetitive and boring. She repeats the same couple of moves for 30 minutes. I get too bored with that. Too much talking and not enough working out. I didn't think it was that great."
2,very poor quality of the picture!!!,"Hi, I'm a great DM-fan. And of course I enjoyed all their videos and songs recorded on that DVD. It's a great collection. BUT!!! The picture quality is more than poor! It's terrible! You get the feeling - you are watching a second or third copy of a video recorded from TV on a videotape!!! All their videos up to 1991 are recorded in such a terrible quality!!!!! Videos, that were released later are very good. I was fully dissapointet by that DVD. I have the Videotape with this compilation also and I think that picture quality is much better their. I was very surprised, that such a great (one of the greatest ever) band as Depeche Mode can release a DVD like that. And there are no bonus-DVD-Materials also. It's an exactly copy of the Videotape, simply. If you are a great DM-fan you have to buy that DVD, but I just want you to know what you get when you'll buy it..... Don't make great illusions. Elena."
5,I love depeche mode...,"Their videos were not groundbreaking (with the exception of enjoy the silence), but with such great music they really didn't have to be. I love depeche mode. They are truly one of my fave groups. Although I don't tend to watch this DVD a lot, it's still good to have if you're a loyal fan. If you're a depeche mode fan then this dvd is A MUST."
2,Excellent Band but a disappointing DVD,"Depeche Mode are one of my favorite bands of all time. Their album Violator is one of my top ten favorite albums of all time (in a list, believe it or not, containing Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Beatles, Eagles etc). While putting together a nice package such as this is a commendable task for a band that has always treated its fans well (consider the many cd singles, various versions of their songs), I was appalled by the poor quality of the picture. The picture was grainy all the way through the DVD. It appeared to be recorded from a television signal on a Fisher VCR. Im surprised no one else mentioned this in their review. As for the sound, its quite mediocre too. Had it not been for the interviews and the number of vidoes included, I would have given it a much lower rating. Too bad, and a shame. Anyhow that's how this DVD looked -- through my eyes."
4,The Untouchables,"The ""collectors edition"" will be released in the fall with a run time of ""109 min."". It will have ""special features"" but I will hang on to the original DVD release as it has a run time of 119 min."
1,Not even with a ten foot pole,"Horrible. Predictable. I watched it with my son one night. Luckily, I checked it out from the public library. I would call it a comic-book of a movie but I'd be insulting comic books. Dialogue so wooden you can build a covered bridge out of her. As for Kevin Costner? Let's hope his Ness winds up in the St Valentine's Day Massacre."
3,Great but not amazing,"A good transfer for a good movie. The original photography doesn't allow a better picture quality, I think. Just spend your time with a good movie."
2,A big letdown,"After reading the high praises on the cover of the DVD, I was expecting a good movie. But it's such a letdown. Compared to The Godfather, this movie can only deserve a 2 stars. The story line is so predictable, while the dialog is so fake. All the main characters are just acting. Don't bother watching this movie, go see The Godfather again."
3,Doesn't stand the test of time well,"I remember being blown away when I first saw this film when released so was waiting in eager expectation for this DVD release. But alas, apart from the cinematography the film was not as gripping as I expected. And what about that mediocre soundtrack! Reinforces De Palma's excellence in set pieces but in terms of holding the entire story together he is quite ordinary (nowhere in the same league as Kubrick, Coppola and Scorsese). This gangster flick does not belong in the same class as The Godfather, Goodfellas nor Miller's Crossing."
2,"Nice Idea, but way to expensive","This game is basically the same idea as the book 'If...'. However, it doesn't have as many questions and costs 2 to 3 times as much. That said, it is a reliable conversation starter."
4,Good for familes with older children,"My children are 5, 8 and 11. We have been using these cards for about a week. I have to skip over some before I can find one that all of my children will understand and be able to contribute their opinions too that is why I say this is for older children (I think 10 and up would understand all of the cards) It is something that we can use for years though and I am sure their answers will change as they grow.I feel the item is overpriced. If the cards were priced at $10-15 I would buy other sets. I paid $27 on here right before the holiday season."
3,Seems like the scent has changed over the years.,"I swear this scent has changed since it came out decades ago. I've been wearing it on & off since the 80's & have always loved the subtle (wouldn't like it if it was strong) tobacco scent. But the bottles I've smelled lately smell much more like an ashtray than a cigar. I came home from the cologne/perfume shop & gave my old bottle in the medicine cabinet another wiff & sure enough my old Polo has that slight cigar scent, not slight ashtray scent.Anyone else get this impression?..."
2,Over Hyped,"It's readable, but not ground breaking. For newer students to Buddhist meditation, it is an excellent introduction to taming one's mind. You get the feeling he's trying to ride the coat tails of his father's, Chogyam Trunpa Rinpoche, past publications, which were deep and very insightful."
4,Good book-very helpful,"This book has been helpful for dealing with anxiety/depression. I'm not much into just meditating or even following Buddhist thinking, however, there is value in what I've learned from this book -- disciplining the mind and learning to keep the mind ""present"". This has helped me from worrying ""too far ahead"" or losing perspective of life by helping strengthen my mind. I highly recommend this book along with practicing some form of meditation if you struggle with anxiety or negative/worrying thoughts."
5,A compelling read,"As a native Detroiter, the streets and locations took me back to my younger days. The drama within the police force, and the machinations involved in studying the crimes was fascinating to me. Each chapter brought more suspense than the previous. The dramatic conclusion of this book will compel me to read this author's next work."
2,"Book is OK, but uh...where's the answer key???","There is no answer key for the hundreds of exercises that follow each lesson. I looked to see if I could buy an answer key separately, but couldn't find it on Amazon. What good is a language book where you can't check your work?"
4,Great Workout!,"This is an excellent workout if you are feeling not-so-challenged by typical prenatal yoga classes and would like to build strength and keep toned. I am 35 weeks and can still do the entire video and feel great after! Highly recommend this video for strengthening, paired with typical prenatal yoga for stretching and flexibility!! It's a great combo to keep you feeling great throughout your pregnancy!"
3,Too Slow,"The yoga in this DVD was way too slow! Maybe good for someone who has NEVER done any yoga or stretching before, but i found this soo slow and the dvd sooo long, that i would do a couple of moves and then fast forward."
4,Soothing nature video with new age music,"This DVD combines beautiful new age music with vivid nature footage of the western/southwestern United States. The music was composed by David Lanz and Paul Speer, popular new age artists and is sure to please. Watch the camera explore streams and waterfalls, the flight of an eagle (from the eagle's point of view), Utah's arches and many other natural wonders.The main menu is kind of cheesy but it's the production that counts...and this one counts! Play this DVD in the background or while napping on the couch. Desert Vision is a pleasant addition to any DVD library. Such a nice price, too :v)."
5,EXCELLENT EARLY 90S HARCORE TECHNO!,IF YOU ARE INTO RAVES AND TECHNO ELECTRONIC MUSIC THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THIS BEST CDS EVER MADE FOR ONE ARTIST . SOME OF THE TRACKS LIKE THE FIRST TRACK IT SOUNDS LIKE A NEW FRESH 2000 TUNE BUT THIS ALBUM ITS PROBLABY ABOUT 8 YEARS OLD I WAS READING SOME OF THE REVIEWS AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE ME IT IS A MIND CONTROLING CD. TOO BAD THERE IS A FEW ALBUMS OUT THERE AS EXCELLENT AS THIS ONE....
4,A different Alejandro?,"I thought I was going to be very disappointed after listening ""No es lo mismo"", but I'm not, really. There are some songs that I personally don't like, they're just not Alejandro, or maybe they're just a ""different"" Alejandro. And I understand that an artist has to evolution in this everchanging world, but I just think that Alejandro is unique as he is, therefore, I believe that experiments (or at least I want to believe that that's all is is) like ""Try to save your s'ong"" and ""12 por 8"", were unnecessary. But thank God for ""Lo diré bajito"", ""Al olvido invito yo"", ""Sandy a orilla do mundo"", ""He sido tan felíz contigo"" y ""Hoy llueve, hoy duele"", those songs by themselves are worth the CD. Alejandro's voice, better than ever!!, beautifully musicalized!!...you must make it part of your collection."
1,Un Pez Fuera Del Agua!,"Realmente que me he quedado sorprendido sobre esta nueva producción de Alejandro Sanz, el estilo está completamente divorciado del de Alejandro. Las letras de las canciones dejan mucho que desear. Alejandro en este disco es como un pez fuera del agua. Una verdadera pena que luego de tantos exitos cosechados Alejandro nos venga con este disparate."
3,Simple but small,It does the job of holding my utensils but there really isn't much space for everything. I do like the sturdy ceramic material though.
5,Super Cute Book,"This is a very cute and fun kids book! I received this book very quickly,but the damaged,the back 2 pages cut with knife. I contacted the seller and they were very sincere. They refunded me fully including postage,but regretted that they didn't have another book. I will be purchasing another soon. This is a very well constructed book."
1,What has music come to?,what is wrong with all you people. This band SUCKS. This is not music. This is not punk.
2,...And Justice For All,"It was very weak, the bass was pretty inaudible. Struck, Drifting, October Nights, and Rough Draft are the only songs worth hearing. They got much better on Ocean Avenue."
4,Listen to the lyrics,"This album is great. If you like the band, you have to hear them live. The violin makes the band. Appreciate the the thought in ""October Nights"" and my favoirte, ""Big Apple Heartbreak."""
5,Great Brazilian Jazz !!!!,"Trio Da Paz is without a doubt one of the top three Brazilian Jazz trios, the other two? Azymuth and Rainforest Trio. All this is achieved by a top-of-the-line artistry and Trio Da Paz has that and more. I agree with the previous reviewer about this album, is flawless and their taste is fascinating; Herbie Mann plays here and his contribution could not be any better. My favourite songs: This is for Luisa, Aquarela Do Brasil and Keep the Spirits Singing. If you like good Jazz and especially Brazilian Jazz this should be part of your collection."
5,Awesome!!!,No complaints... everything as expected... The opera is one of my all time favorites... Lovely performance by two awesome singers.
4,Too weird NOT to be true.,"If someone had given me ""Everything She Ever Wanted"" disguised as fiction, I probably would have found it too improbable to enjoy. Ann Rule is up to her usual fine form in this tale of a southern belle who truly believed herself to be the center of the universe and would do everything--including murder--to get what she wanted. The least satisfying aspect of the book was insufficient explanation (to me) for how Pat Allanson was able to get so many otherwise intelligent and reasonable adults to go along with, or at least turn a blind eye to, her schemes and shenanigans. The included photographs are an important adjunct to the text--you have to see the changes in Pat to believe them."
4,Flashback to my home town.,I was a senior in college when the Allansons were killed and only lived a mile from their house. What a surprise this book was as I dont recall any of the events. Since I was familiar with the locations in the book it was very interesting and a quick read. Ann Rule is an engaging writer and I am impressed with her reasearch as the book is packed with details.
2,Canned actually does taste better,"It's not terrible, but it's not very good. For the price, you can go to your grocery store and get one that is just as good, if not better. I sent 8 of the 9 packets back."
5,cover songs never sounded so good,"I really can't stand cover songs, usually they sound so boring and forced and I usually think the artist covering the songs is doing so because they have no ability to make up their own songs, I always felt this way until I bought Medusa by Annie Lennox. This CD actually changed my mind about artists who record other artists songs. Annies cover song of Train in Vain is even better than the Clash who originally recorded it. Other favorites are Don't Let it Bring You Down, Downtown Lights and Take Me to the River. Annie not only has one of the greatest singing voices of all time, she also is an artist who knows great songwriting when she sees or hears it, and a singer who knows great songwriting in my opinion is a great singer even if the songs are not her own."
3,Good effort at a cover album.,"I found this to be, on the whole, well-produced album but the choice of material ranges from fantastic (""No More I Love You's"") to what-was-she-thinking (""White Shade Of Pale""). The off selections, while well done, still strike me as being a big disconnect. Albums are risks on some point and good on her for doing it, and I'd rather hear Annie on an off day (which are few and far between) than most of the ""best"" of syntho-euro-pop."
5,And then there was Annie Lennox.,Superb is the only way to describe this album and it's all cover tunes which in itself is surprising. Her cover of 'Lighter Shade Of Pale' is mesmerizing. Probably her best solo work. Try the Eurythmics 'Peace' album for more great stuff and their Greatest Hits package highlights her magnificant voice.
4,EP with bonus tracks,1) My Book; 2) Big Beautiful South (Unavailable on LP); 3) Bigger Doesn't Mean Better (Unavailable on LP); 4) Speak to Me (Unavailable on LP - Recorded Live on North Sea Ferries)
3,I GIve it a 3 cuz....,they tone down the violciens but there still is all the major stuff from the orignal......i still like this game but im still giveing it a 3.
1,Bent frames,I had to return the glasses because the frames were bent. I did not receive all of my money back because I had to pay for shipping even though the glasses were defective. I will never buy sunglasses online again. Plus the glasses were dated 1996 on the paper in the box!!!!
5,Jimi's Best album,"I recently purchased this on 180 gram virgin vinyl. WOW!! The CD sound is nothing compared to the sound of Jimi on vinyl, the way he was intended. The songs sound warm and live on vinyl. LITTLE WING and IF 6 WAS 9 are excellent along with SPANISH CASTLE MAGIC and CASTLES MADE OF SAND and AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE. The drumming of Mitch Mitchell and the sound of the guitars of Jimi and Noel Redding make this a tight sounding and well recorded collection of Jimi's best. The album was ... vinyl with a bonus booklet. The album cover is gatefold cover with all the original artwork. Highly recommended!!"
5,A UNDER RATED ALBUM,"this album is like the brother of are you expirenced the songs rock on here its a cool cosmic album. spanish castle magic has to be like the heaviest song on here. hendrix stands out on this he rocks hard all 13 tracks rock out loud,long live the almighty jimi hendrixr.i.p jimi hendrix"
5,Classic Hendrix,This is a must for any Hendrix fan. This is in my top 20 albums of all time. Buy it NOW!
1,just bought a brand new LP,"I wanted the original Jimi Hendirix LP, so it arrived, brand new to openI played on my brand new player, and it keep jumping and loosing parts of several tracks.I am really disappointed,and definitely wouldn't reccomend this item, even if it looks like new, the audio is really bad"
3,Too compressed,Eddie Kramer can't seem to keep his hands off the compressor. heaven forbid we have any space in the music of Jimi Hendrix. Though it is smashed up in your face it is still not as bad as the 1997 remasters and the overall sound is bright and crisp. needless to say the music is timeless.
4,Remembering...,"""Greatest Hits"" is greatest not because it's the best Brenda Fassie CD musically (it is not), but because its release is a tribute to the late Brenda Fassie, a lady full of heart with the purest, most powerful voice. Compilations can be tricky for artists who have expressed themselves in very different styles, but to remember the whole of Brenda is to include songs from her earlier pop Big Dudes days to the kwaito and later stuff. Though it's been a couple years and thousands of miles, every June 16th marking the Soweto uprisings I also remember ""The Madonna of the Townships"" and how she loved her country. (Bongani, all grown up, I appreciated your words on the liner notes, as I remember the days I spent with your mother when you were a baby, how she loved you so.)"
4,movie was overall uplifting and a breath of fresh air,"movie may be lost in the past but man what a past! good dance steps(for then) and great music, i wish i could find the soundtrack!!!!! overall uplifting and fun to settle down and watch."
5,80's Movie Pro,"I really love this movie. For those who wish to sell this movie please contact me, I would love to own this movie. This movie puts me in mind of Breakin' aka (breakdance). The messages may be a little different but the dancing is very similar. I'm just an 80's movie fan what can I say. Again, this is a great movie. You won't be disappointed! :)"
5,A surprise hit with interesting characters,"A sci-fi mystery series that is well developed and interesting to watch, this cable series hopefully will be around for more seasons to come. The best way to describe this series is a combination of the X-Files meets Close and Counters of the Third Kind.While normally not a sci-fi fan this series always has something new and fascinating in it. Jaci Rae"
5,the 4400,a great addition to my dvd collection. a thought provoking series. can't wait for season three on dvd.
1,Cats won't use it,"The pellets in this kitty litter are larger than the usual ""sand"" texture our cats are used to. So they refuse to use it."
2,Our kitten eats the pellets...,"We have a 9 week old kitten that we recently adopted from the local pound and she's been eating the pellets, which we think is causing her to have diarrhea. We just discovered that she's been pooing under the coach as well. Maybe Feline Pine is good for certain cats, but not this one. Also doesn't seem to absorb the smell very well......UPDATE: It turns out our kitten had coccidia, which was causing her diarrhea. Perhaps she was eating the pellets because of condition - I'm not sure. We stopped using the product in any case."
5,The only litter I use...,"and both of my cats give it a high five! I love being a cat mom, but hated traditional cat litter... the smell, the mess, and the removal. Frustrated and searching for a greener path, I discovered Feline Pine. Now I have no problems with litter box odor and once the poop is flushed, the odor free dust is recycled outside. New to Feline Pine, my pound kitties had no problems adapting to the change (I think they were relieved). My mother was so impressed that she started buying it and her Sammy loves it too. I have tried ""copy cat"" brands, but Feline Pine is worth the extra cost. To top it off, Amazon delivers the 20 lb bag right to my door. How cool is that?"
1,"bought by mistake, don't like this at all","i've been using feline pine clumping for years, and have been very happy with it. unfortunately i was looking for a prime subscription and all amazon offers is this version, which is awful. cats hardly even use it as they prefer the clumping version. maybe that's just what they're used to it. but i prefer the clumping too. this is difficult to clean, and when wet, turns into a mush that gets mixed in with rest of litter. so u need to scoop lot extra out with each cleaning. going straight back to clumping version"
3,Incredible odor absorber- NOT a standalone litter,"Reading all the negative reviews I completely understand the issues they'd be talking about. Then again it should be common sense looking at these that obviously it wouldn't clump. These pellets are huge. They're probably 3/4 an inch long and 1/4 in diameter. Clay litter obviously is maybe 1/8 inch round, so it sticks to poop. These are kind of glossy.So bottom line is if you use this as a litter by itself, you're kind of dumb for even trying to do that with pellets like that.However, if you mix it in with clay litter and baking soda, it absorbs odor like you wouldn't believe. You can literally eat dinner right outside the litter box and won't smell a thing.Get the CLUMPING feline pine. That clumps and absorbs moisture perfectly. Also no odor. That's five stars, this is three just because it eliminates odors."
2,This used to be much better,"Feline Pine recently changed the formula to make it ""2x absorbent."" That also means it disintegrates twice as fast and now I have litter dust everywhere in my house. If you don't mind it in your bed, in the kitchen, on the furniture, and on your clothes, this litter is for you. It hides the odor better than any other litter - period.FYI, this is the second set of cats I'ved used Feline Pine with so I've been a customer for over 15 years. I just vacuumed yesterday and there's litter dust on my dresser, on the sofa and on the floor. I've bought my last bag of Feline Pine. What a shame."
3,This was once an excellent product,"Looks like Feline Pine has changed their product to make a larger profit. They have taken the large pellets and made them into smaller bits. Now there is more sawdust tracking outside of the cat box, and you have to change the litter box more often. This is still a good product, but the larger pellets were excellent. ""New and Improved"" is really, new and you're screwed. It is a shame a company can take an excellent product and make it mediocre. I would have paid a higher price for the original."
1,Worst cat litter ever.,"Worst cat litter ever, I can't tell how bad I'm disappointed with this litter, poor cat pees and the litter turns into dust right away, then he does not wanna pee in the same box again until you change the whole litter, avoid this."
4,FELINE PINE not ALWAY PINE,"Well I really liked the freshness of the pine, BUT when I went to purchase it at PETCO, the freshness was not there and left a 'staleness' of odor in the air. I took it back and apparently the whole supply smelled that way. They told me that happens every once in awhile. My advice to you if you purchase it at a pet store, have them open it first. My guess is that what I got was old."
5,Great book! Lots of humor!,"This is a book suitable to both insiders and outsiders of the finance world, even the most complex derivative products are presented in a way that everybody can understand. I admire the author's writing gift. It is also very entertaining and realistic, its humor is all based on the reality. And beyond all the great things about this book, the most important is Frank's intelligence and lucidity that the reader can feel throughout the book."
2,Locker room stories told by a salesman,"This is not a serious book, but rather a collection of war stories told by salesmen when they get together. It could have been about any industry, but in this case, the author found himself on Wall Street. Granted, Wall Street is serious business, but this book isn't."
4,"Interesting and informative, but","I enjoyed the book and found most of the explanations well written and concise. You need not fear you won't understand what a derivative is when you read this book. But, I do not understand why Mr. Partnoy took the job and took the money from a bank filled with people he seems to despise. He doesn't hold back on his opinions of his managers, or peers, and he is indeed very cynical of the derivatives game. He should have quit after one day!"
2,Careful! Adult language and content!,"Just a FYI for other parents: this book does have curse words in it, has references to drugs, and a discussion on whether the 14 yr old should have sex in the backseat of a car."
3,ok.,"This is the 1st book I read in the series because of unfortunate circumstances (but I have bought every book in the series). It's a good book, the one thing that I think needed ALLOT more work is describing the action (fighting scenes) it made me conclude that this writer does not have a great sense of imagination when is comes to this category and in a book about dark elves it was very lacking. However I am intrigue to see what the other writers can do."
4,"decent, but could have been better","Richard Baker, did do an ok job. The intro to a new character was fairly good. But he used that same words to describe him, as if that was his only detail. He did however make a key character act pitiful. Halistra was a good(evil) character and he broke her. The action was dull for the most, despite the thick plot. But the ending is what saved him from a bad score. It's not everyday you see... well it was cool to see them fight.Ok, but gives the awesome series a flat tire. Book IV better pick up the ball where Baker dropped it."
4,"Good, but not instant response","Works as advertised nice to be able to program as needed. HOWEVER, there is a delay in the mechanism so it does not have the 'instantaneous' response of the headunit buttons. Otherwise great product."
2,What A BIG MESS!!,"I bought my grinder many years ago (at a premium, too) because I thought it would do a great job for coffee and espresso. But, mine has some sort of static problem, and creates a huge disaster every time I use it!! I hate it!! Coffee grounds go everywhere - the floor, the countertop, etc.I am really disappointed! It was too expensive for this to happen! I need to go and buy a basic grinder to replace it!"
2,Coffee Everywhere,"The first day I used this grinder it sprayed coffee all over my kitchen counter. I was too lazy to pack it up and return it, so now, many months later, I am living with coffee grinds all over the place. Also, the plastic container for the ground coffee has become cracked all over for no apparent reason. I would give it 2 stars, because it does grind the coffee better than the 19.99 handheld model, and if you have time to play around with the settings, you can adjust the coarseness of the grind pretty well."
3,Capresso Coffee Grinder,"I indeed have had trouble with fine particles of coffee leaking out from the machine. Most of it goes into the compartment where is should, but I would not say mine is neat by any means. It does grind evenly tho and I have had it for years. However the machine itself does seem to stay warm. Mine has not had problem with beans sticking, and I got to thinking that I noticed when looking at beans that some are oilier than others--but I don't buy the oilier ones, just the dry ones, so perhaps that is it. Noisy yes, but it is consistent. I am going to look at the one at Starbuck's since someone mentioned it."
2,No fine grind,My grinder won't grind fine enough for cone drip coffee. I'm frustrated because I haven't had a good cup of coffee from this grinder after a week of trying.After reading other reviews here I conclude there is great inconsistency from one grinder to the next. When I choose the finest setting I still get small chunks of bean. I can't get anything close to the powder-like consistency of commercial grinders (such as the #5 setting that Peet's uses for cone drip). Another reviewer stated they could grind for Turkish coffee. My grinder doesn't come close.
2,Think twice,"Not only did Amazon disappoint me with unusually slow shipping (it took more than a week and I popped for two-day shipping!!), but I spend more time cleaning up after this thing than I do drinking the coffee. It's just a pig. It grinds the coffee well enough, but the grounds end up EVERYWHERE. I've had it for a month and I'm about ready to switch back to my $15.00 cheapie grinder. It's just too messy to give more than two stars."
3,No Need,"The Anthems are great. The energy isn't. I'd much rather find a collection with the tracks as a whole then listen to a massive collection of chopped up songs. Its ok for background music like Muzak or something, but its not something you sit and listen to. A GOOD Trance set is like 'This is Ibiza Trance'. It's 2 CDs (22 songs, no mixing) plus it comes with a bonus CD of a REAL DJ mixing not some computer doing the work to make it sound mixed. If you're looking for a wode selection of parts of tracks, this is the CD set for you...... if you want some energy and something to get you moving, get a DJ mixed CD."
5,It is what it is...,"People who gave this cd one or two stars obviously never knew what Gatecrasher was about. The whole point of National Anthems is not to showcase great mixing skills, or long intricately composed songs. These were the songs that were mashing 'Crasher kids' brains into a pulp back then. They are only a taste of what these songs were, and it was done like that on purpose in order to be able to fit all the songs in two cds. If you dont own any other Gatecrasher CD then obviously you are going to think the cd stinks, but if you are a fan of late 90's and early 00's trance/house like I am, you'll know what the cd is about. Tracks like Dooms Night, Toca's Miracle, Scorchio, Universal Nation, Wizards of the Sonic, (i could go on forever) make National Anthems a great addition to your cd collection, but only if you understand what its about..."
5,The Gospel According to St John,The book is an essential reference for the Gospel of John...the book requires careful attention to detail..but the reward is great for those who stick with it. Highly recommended for the serious student.
4,Good record and Lennon and Yoko are LEGENDS,"Toro: Say Pancho, who does that loco one-star reviewer Fed Up/Cranky think he is disgracing John Lennon and his wife Yoko One. Pancho: Toro, I think he is a dirty gringo for saying Kurt and Courtney were better(they were losers). Toro: John Lennon's Double Fantasy is a good record, shame Lennon died. Pancho: Songs like Starting Over, Woman, Watching the Wheels, Cleanup Time and Beautiful Boy are great songs. Toro: Yoko's songs were tolerable though too weirds for us frogs. We say VAMINOS from here and buy now or you will be called stupido!"
4,What Shouldn't Be,"Now, I bought this album recently and listened to it several times through. This album would be really great, if ol' Yoko's stuff wasn't there. She's not exactly the greatest songwriter or singer. John's stuff on the album is great, like Cleanup Time and Woman. Some of Yoko's stuff takes some time to get used to, but they should have just put their songs on their own albums."
4,John's triumphant -- and tragic -- return to recording,"This album, of course, marked John Lennon's return to recording, after a lengthy layoff. He was tragically gunned down shortly after the album was released.On Double Fantasy, John's songs shine brighter than any of his works since the Imagine album. Yoko is, well...Yoko. Take her or leave her. I choose the latter. Thank goodness for programmable CD players.Do yourself a favor when you order Double Fantasy. Order the Milk & Honey CD also (which is basically an unfinished Double Fantasy II album.) Then make a tape or a CD-R of all of John's songs from both albums. You'll have one sterling single album of some of John Lennon's best songs...minus Yoko's various ""attempts."""
3,Yoko Ono Mars an Otherwise Wonderful Album,"The Lennon tracks on this album are great. Unfortunately, the Yoko Ono tracks are unlistenable. If you buy this, you're going to want to re-record it and cut out the Yoko tracks. They should have re-issued the CD as an EP with only the Lennon songs.Lennon's tragic flaw was that he ever let Yoko Ono near a microphone. Sadly, one of the extra tracks added was Walking on Glass, giving you one extra song to eliminate when you re-record the album."
3,Interesting and attempted balance,"Origins of Terrorism attempts to both be balanced and discuss the psychologies of terrorists. The chapter by Martha Crenshaw (I recommend reading her book on terrorism rather than just the chapter) presents the opposing view to the chapter by Post. While interesting, the psychology advanced is mostly the ""crazy terrorist"" psychology. I didn't get much out of the book, except for the first two chapters and chapter 10. Chapter 10, which discusses terrorist motivations, is incredibly useful. The rest of the book is average but unremarkable."
5,HENDRIX 4EVER,"there arnt enough stars in the universe to rate this album, JIMI was is and always will be the greaeest guitarist to ever breathe oxygen, and this album definetely proves it."
3,Feeling kinda stupid!,"Well,Being the Hendrix fanatic I am I jumped on the whole lot...big mistake, the DVDs are cool, but short (about 20 min each). Unless you have do not have these CDs already, or you must have the DVDs, skip it.These are the SAME remasters from before. As another person pointed out, the track times are the same and when I ripped them into ITunes, it recognized them as the 1997 editions.I feel like I just wasted $40I should have waited for reviews!"
5,I Didn't Understand...,I didn't understand the genius of Jimi Hendrix until I understood the Blues. And I didn't understand the intensity of his music until I raised an ADHD child and lived with a manic-depressive. His music is a creative force.
2,WARNING !!!!! Loudness wins!,Loudness War wins! I was wondering from the discussion of the 1997 vs 2010 discussion and took a look. The 2010 version is definitely clipped. Sadly I thought it actually improved the sound (imaging) while equally destroying it - yes I notice the clipping - idiots. FWIW.
3,Overrated,"I believe that this cd is largely overrated. While it does have good points, there is so much ""filler"" that I can't honestly give this cd 5 stars. Now that I've said that, ""Are You Experienced"" has several extremely good songs. My favorite on the album is ""Hey Joe"" but I also like ""Purple Haze"", ""Manic Depression"", ""The Wind Cries Mary"", and ""Are You Experienced?"" I also like most of the bonus tracks. This is a good album, and is definitely one to buy. However, don't expect to be blown away."
4,great intro,"I think that this Hendrix collection of songs is a good intro-- lots of rockers. some would argue that Band of Gypsys was better, but would agree that this is a good starting point. true, some of the songs may be a little played out at this point. but, that's part of what's great about ""Are You Experienced,"" too. it has a lot of the staples. Hey Joe... Purple Haze... Fire. this and ""Axis: Bold as Love"" are good Hendrix intros. they really show the range and the feeling."
5,Classic Jimi,"This is just a must-have if you like Rock N Roll.I was a little disappointed of the DVD, I was hoping to see the making of the whole album and not just 4 songs."
5,"jimi,s amazing 1st album !!!","jimi hendrix,s first album ;are you experienced was released in 1967!!which was a very cool year for rock music not to mention that same year the psychedelic era was in full bloom.there isn,t a bad song on this album.not one!!!from purple haze to red house this album just smokes!!!!it is so sad that a few short years after this album,s release jimi hendrix died in september of 1970.the same year of this album,s release jimi played the monterey pop festival and gave an amazing performance!!this is a definate must have for any hendrix fan!!this is one of the all time classic rock albums!! jimi hendrix,s albums were remastered very carefully and the sound results are amazing!!"
1,Poor sound rip off,I love Jimi Hendrix and I was really excited to buy this album on sale. But all of my excitement vanished when I heard the whole album. The quality of the recording is very poor. You cannot hear Jimi's lyrics on The Wind Cries Mary or Foxey Lady. Maybe the master recording of this CD is in better condition but I don't suggest you run out and buy this CD. It's a waste of money.
1,CRAP!,"This album is garbage. How can this NOISE be considered ""music""?? Do not waste your money on this junk."
4,sound,"I hear a difference. The mixes are different. I think the new mix is better. I think we're into diminishing returns. Still... you'll have tohear this if you want the best sound and make your choice. Vocals definitely more upfront, detailed for example. I think your system willultimately reveal this or not. Don't doubt, there is a difference."
1,Worst.Camera.Ever.,"I've never owned any device that went from unboxing to back-of-the-drawer (and on to Goodwill today). If you have the appallingly bad sense to consider one of these (except from Goodwill as a parts project ;-) ) then professional help is in order.It will take pictures, once in a while, after a fashion. And we're not talking high fashion here. Poor light. Poor focus. You can do better with a $10 keychain camera from Walgreens.It will play music. But it plays them into a micro (2.5"" mm) socket, so nobody's headphones fit. The sound quality is marginal at best.Webcam? Yeah, I think I got that working once. Once. Never mind.So far as I can tell, the single use that this device has is to ferret out the shills in Amazon's reviews. Look for anything over two stars."
3,Samsung all in one camera/MP3/PC camera,"This all in one package concept is cool. The accent colors attracted my daughter to the camera. It is really small, so that you can put it in you pocket. Runs off of two AA batteries.Camera - VGA resolution - just OK for email - if there are MP3 files on the Compact Flash card, the MP3 player will start up when powered on. You have to remember to hit the mode switch to get to taking pictures. Remember to tell your friends how to operate it. MP3 Player - Small compact flash card shipped with the camera. To make it usable for MP3, you will have to go out a get a larger Compact Flash card. Remember that 1MB is about 1 minute of music. You may pay as much for a card as the camera. - The noise between sounds are irritating (too much) - The headphones use a 3/32"" plug and is hard to find headphones with this plug (standard is 1/8"" plug)."
1,gaaahh-bage,"Piece of junk. Firstly, the wires weren't run correctly. The colors for identifying which wire goes to which turn signal were wrong. Left blinker turned on the right one, and vice versa. I had to cut and splice the wires onto the correct locations. That's right...even with the plugs. And then...The thing melted after using it for a few months. Shorted out my whole lighting system, and caused me to lose all indicator lights until I removed it.Lest you think I just screwed up installing it, I did it twice. And this is not my first trailer wiring harness. It's pretty idiot proof, the plugs only line up one way. Anyone who's done this before knows that if you're buying any harness, it comes with plugs, and just piggy-backs onto your existing wires via the manufacturer's plugs. They only go together ONE WAY.Piece 'o crap. Definitely do not recommend."
4,oh so close,"This box set is frustrating since it's so close to being perfect. The problems are that chronological order isn't followed all the way through, there isn't much commentary, there are rarities missing, and there are album tracks that we already have. Some rarities missing are Easy Money (remix), Tell her about it (extended mix), To make you feel my love (alternate), and all the live tracks that were omitted from his millennium concert live album. This is still a worthwhile addition to your collection-it's just a shame that it had the potential to be one of the best box sets ever and they dropped the ball."
1,Very poor songs - nothing you want to hear,"I still love Bill's output from 1971 to 1981, and a few songs after that. But the songs on this compilation are terrible. They should have stayed in the dusty cardboard box at the bottom of the closet. I couldn't even listen to all the discs because they're so poor. After enduring as much pain as I could I realized I wasn't a Billy Joel fan after all. Beware."
5,Good Book,"This book reminds me so much of my life growing up in a small town in South Dakota, i didn't live on a farm but worked on one and still work on one during the summers. I thouroghly enjoyed Kent's abliltity to describe certain events, sights and the other 4 sense's. A very good book i sat down and read it in a day no more than 12 hours total reading, it sucked me right in."
5,Hillariously Subtle Comedy,"I have always admired Kelsey Grammar because of his multi talented personality, he plays a number of personalities with grace and ease, and yet, all perfectly fascinating! I think Frazier is the best role he has ever done and paired with his equally snobblish but lovable brother, Niles, expertly played by the Emmy winning David Hyde Price, makes for hours of great entertaining. Jane Leeves & Peri Gilpin are superb comedic actresses, and John Mahoney is in a class by himself! I also like the fact that the visiting actors are always already famous in their own right. Oh, and let us not forget ""Eddie""!"
5,The bible,"If you could choose only one book about molecular modelling - this should be it. Everything is covered, more or less thourough, from ab initio to molecular docking, algorithms, force fields, molecular dynamics, etc. It is well written, but also works well if you want to look up single key words. The book can be read by novices to molecular modelling as well as it is useful for experts. I can highly recommend it."
4,Pimsleur Russian,"I bought these CDs as a way of working on basic speaking and listening skills. In addition to these CDs, I'm using a text book to learn grammar and writing. If you are using a different approach, this review might not be very useful.Working on the Pimsleur CDs definitely has improved my speech and listening skills quite a bit. They also have some useful vocabulary on them, although that wasn't a primary goal. I would give this product 5 stars, but I think they should add more indexing to the CDs. There are two tracks per CD, and fast-forwarding and moving backwards are a lot more annoying than they should be.I haven't used any competing products, so I can't do any comparisons. I don't think that these CDs would work well as a substitute for a text book, but that's just my opinion."
5,So helpful,"I'll be traveling to Russia and needed a very quick crash course in speaking the language. I've learned other languages but this course, by far, is the easiest way to do so. I've been teaching myself to read Russian but after listening to these CDs, I've realized I was really off on my pronunciations. Not only have these CDs strengthened my speaking ability but they've made reading the language so much easier as well. These CDs will definitely complement any studying you are doing of this language. True, the CDs may initially seem repetitive and a tad boring but get past lesson one and you find that this really works Give it a chance and you will learn quite a bit in these sixteen lessons."
4,"Great breath, fair depth","The 3rd edition is much improved providing great breath of topic coverage. On the downside the coverage of extended stored procedures is one page so this is not a programmers book. It is one of those books that has something to say about everything SQL Server could possibly be employed to do, and that makes it unique. IMHO the publisher should break this book into a 3-4 book series and work on adding depth in future editions. Buy other books for depth at this time such as Soukup's for insights and background, SQL Server Programming for programming and England's book on Performance and Optimization and Tuning if interested. I'm a 25+ year programmer in 15 or so languages (prefering C & C++) and believe SQL is pretty easy to pick up if you are willing to read 5-6 good books. Make this one of them."
1,For What Software Version is This Book?,What is the electronic workbench version for this lab manual? This question was already asked but no answer to date?
4,AN ENCOURAGING STORY OF DREAMS COME TRUE,"How refreshing to find a story focusing on what many may term ""old-fashioned values"" - hard work, determination, and courage. All are in abundant supply in Noel Streatfeild's ""Ballet Shoes."" Also in abundant supply is the performing talent of Elizabeth Sastre who gives winsome voice to three orphan girls who are intent upon helping their adoptive parents and making a place for themselves in the world.Ms. Streatfeild, the author of 80 some children's books, admits to loving the theatre all of her life. That's evident in this warm, encouraging story. The girls, Pauline, Petrova, and Posy enroll in the Children's Academy of Dancing and Stage Training, each vowing to make good. They practice, rehearse, practice and rehearse until eventually each discovers what her special talent might be.Listen and enjoy this encouraging story of dreams come true.- Gail Cooke"
5,This book encourages children to work to suceed,"This book is about a challenge. A challenge not everyone could meet. It begins with a fossil hunter who finds more ""fossils"" then his niece bargained for when he brings home three orphaned girls. The girls grow up and realize that they have no true surname. They adopt the name Fossil and thus begins the story of the Fossil Family. Taking the advice of a boarder in their house, Pauline, Petrova, and Posy set out to make the name Fossil known to all. Sent to a stage school, the girls each find out their own special talent. This book helps young readers to realize in a fun way their own special gifts."
5,My FAVORITE book!,"I have read many books, and Ballet Shoes, by Noel Streatfield, is definitely my favorite! I would recommend it to any girl who loves to read, or loves to dance or act!If you are going to read any other of Noel Streatfield's books (Theater Shoes, Movie Shoes, Dancing Shoes, or any other books) then you should read this one first. The Fossil sisters (Pauline, Petrova, and Posy) are mentioned as adults in some of the other books. I hope you decide to read this book! You will not be disapointed!"
4,Shaker Basket,"This basket is HUGE! I don't care too much for the detachable handle, it's kind of awkward to lift and shake. The basket is heavy, and even heavier with the food in it. I love the idea of the basket itself, and it holds so much, I don't think anyone with a grill should be without one. Although, there is room for improvement."
5,"I don't understand why I loved this story, but I did.","A little boy is picked up by a driven carnival barker-type of man who teaches the kid to levitate - really! Or, a child is taken in hand by a smart man who knows how to raise a child to be industrious and get what he wants. He demands perfection of the kid and gets it. Along the way is a story which is a metaphor of the history of the US before, during and after the Depression. It's shocking, sweet, and inspiring. I give it a 9 only because it seemed to me to hurry at the end. I had become so attached to the kid, that I wanted DETAILS on even the years at the second half of his life. P.S. It is NOT at all a Paul Auster-type of story, and I've read them all"
3,Might have been...,"If Auster either stuck to the allegory of art and artist that is at the heart of this book, or replaced the cerebral manner in which the story is told with a more passionate one, this might have been a better book. Allegory might have moved him into the fantastic world that the book hints at in a frustrating way without ever exploring. Passionate storytelling might have built itself into a genuinely moving story. I applaud Auster for taking risks and moving himself forward, but I finished this novel only so that it wouldn't bother me by sitting on the shelf unfinished..."
4,Ingenius,"Origianl. Ingenius. Fun. And oh so catchy. A quick and delightful read. As enjoyable, if not more, than Harry Potter."
2,"I love Auster's books, but this one was disappointing",I read a lot of Auster's books and did not like this one at all.compared to the other books that i read by Auster I found this one to be boring and kind of silly.
4,Worth reading,"Mr. Vertigo had reached a special place in my mind, though it had been over-actioned meaning - to many events with a little sense of a soap opera. But steel, the amusing writing style of Auster could get to anyone by its being so direct and precised. the describing of a process of changing during a lifetime - which everyone of us goes trough, naturally, is told by those last descritions of mine and also by flying..."
2,Disappointing work from a master author,"I've read quite abit of Auster's work, but found Mr. Vertigo to be a painful experience. The characters here are the barest of sketches, the writing rush and lazy when compared to the gorgeous imagery of other works (most notably the New York Trilogy and Music of Chance). Riddled with anachronistic speech, a pedestrian and predictable plot, and a clear lack of focus, Mr. Vertigo is nothing but a disappointment."
2,A Disappointment.,"Auster is one of my favorite authors--I've read everything he's published. I found this book to be very uncharacteristic of his style and also just a badly-told tale, clumsily written. Where is the inspiration that went into City of Glass, for example, or In The Country of Last Things? However, I look forward to new work by this author"
3,Looking for an escape-Tired of Politics,"I read one of K. Shay's books years ago and absolutely loved it so I decided to try a new one. I think her writing style is fantastic, I just wish she would write something that allows you to escape from reality. This book is very politically driven and I couldn't finish it because I just kept getting angry with the dialogue between the H & H.This is her choice and I am sure she has fans that love everything she writes, but I will be steering clear of all books with plots such as this one."
3,Emotional,Emotionally draining for sure. Learned a lot about gang violence and passion that people have to make a difference. All this is wrapped around a love story and a uncharacteristic political figure.
2,I tried...,"I am usually a fan of K. Shay but I made it through about 4 chapters before I could not torture myself anymore. I wanted to love it, I really did but it was really boring."
3,Book,This book was pretty good and not was I was expecting. It was a little too drawn out for me. It was a little slow.
2,Isn't even the same color!,"This bag looks royal blue to me, doesn't it? Well no, the bag is the size of my head and it's PURPLE.Luckily my roommate loves purple and doesn't mind using a mini jansport so I gave it to her. They should put a better picture up and remind us of the size and how small it really is. They shouldn't forget to put the word MINI!"
4,Cute backpack but too small,"When you look at the measurements keep in mind that this backpack tapers at the top. It might fit a checkbook wallet, small cosmetics bag and a small bottle of water comfortably. You can fit keys and a cell in the outside pocket. I can see how people liked it to carry to Disneyland or a theme park to carry just the essentials, but its just to small for someone like me. I like backpacks instead of handbags... I think the perfect size would be one inbetween this and a regular full sized backpack. Off to purchase the ""Spring Break"" style to see if that will work for me... unfortunately its also difficult to tell from the photos! Overall, again this is a really cute backpack, but best if you want a REALLY small bag!I added a photo with the regular ones so you can see the size in comparison to a set of keys and a pair of reading glasses. If you have any questions about the photo feel free to ask. Hope it helps a little."
4,good basic mini-backpack,"I got this half-size backpack because I needed something small and wearable to keep my stuff secure while caring for an active toddler at the park. This backpack does the job. It's well-constructed and tough, even after washing. The fabric is durable and the pockets are well-designed for a few simple items - for example, you can keep your phone and plastic cards separate from your bigger items. I've used the Jansport full-size bags and liked them, this one is a half-size version. It turned out to be a great hiking bag for short day hikes - I like to pack the absolute minimum I can get away with, so I appreciate its small size when I'm only going to be out on the trail for a few hours. My toddler grandson saw it and wanted one, and it's been a super school bag for him too. As a pre-schooler, he's got stuff he carries around, and this fits him to a T, and is tough and washable. There are tougher bags out there, but not at this price. For normal family use, I'd recommend it."
3,Does its job,"This is a true mini pack, good for day use. I got it for my sister and she uses it as a diaper bag. It can expand to be roomy, but the material is not great. String is constantly coming out and the cloth is not durable. They do not make Jansports like they used to. I wish it had a side pocket though."
1,Better ways to do it...,"I purchased this several years ago so I could use Skype for my home phone service. Back when I purchased it, the technology was just too primitive and I wound up throwing it away and getting phone service from my cable supplier. It was hard to use, some of which might be my fault, I admit.IMO, the technologies have just run by this item."
4,"Good line quality, but lacks basic features.","Great phone range/line quality considering we live in a concrete building with lots of interference. Easy setup. Poor battery life (we have two handsets and neither lasts more than an hour of talk time out of the cradle.) Numbers cannot be permanently assigned 'landline' or 'skype' and must be selected for each call. No speed dial function. Overall, pleased with the phone."
4,Good book,My 2yr. old (almost 3) really liked this book at first and he still likes it but I think its a little too easy for him to find the pictures now. He still enjoys reading it but I come up with my own questions of what to find in the pictures. i think it would be great for 18months to 2yrs. old.
5,Best film I've seen in a long time!,Funny with an immature twist. But at the same time a striking description of a young mans way of dealing with life using his boyish fantasies of beeing a supervillain.
1,Watch what you buy,"I bought the Primvera Suretrak Project Manager, after I bought it we had it installed and found that it would not work with todays computers, we tried to return it and was told we could not.This is my first and last purchase from Amazon, bad merchandise and bad customer service.Jack Jackson"
2,DECEPTIVE PRESENTATION,"My intent was to buy an 8"" set and a 9"" set of cake pans as a gift to my daughter. (both sizes 2"" deep)The error was my own, but the presentation made the error understandable.The two different sizes were posted on different pages - making comparisons more difficult. I thought it odd that the smaller size was more expensive than the larger size. I did not realize that it was not even for one set of two until my daughter kept insisting that she only received one pan. I was paying more [...] and only getting one pan. Why is one smaller pan more expensive than two of the same but larger pans in the first place? Now, if I order another pan I get charged for shipping again. It isn't going happen. Following is the heading as displayed on the web site:Wilton Aluminum Performance Pans Set of 2 9-Inch Round Cake SetNew: [...]Wilton 8-Inch-by-2-Inch Round CakeNew: [...]"
1,WHERE'S THE REST OF THE SERIES????,Whoever's responsible for the hack that is an incomplete Cheers dvd set should be kicked in the nards repeatedly! YOU GUYS SUCK!
2,didn't like it at all,Cheesy acting and obviously a very low budget film. The trailer made it look a lot better than the film was.
1,Truly Disappointed,I really had high hopes for this movie but I was sadly disappointed by the terrible (and I mean truly terrible) acting of the leading female character.SPOLIERSBy the end of the movie I was not terribly sorry to see her get shot. It was a relief in comparison to the constant irrational screaming. I felt it was very unrealistic and almost sexist for the female lead to be so insane and annoyingly vocal throughout the film. Perhaps that is what the writers think of women and their reactions to stressful and extreme situations. The story was just OK and the idea was clever but in the end I was very happy to see credits. Waste of money.
5,Give It a Chance,"If you have read other reviews about this movie, you have most likely come across really bad reviews. In my opinion, great movie! After watching it, I very badly wanted to watch it over again. It is obviously a low budget movie, but do not let that make you think lowly about it. I would understand that most people would start to get bored at the 30ish minute point, but if you get past it, it is an amazing film that made my heart stop at many points. Watch it all the way through. You won't be sorry!"
2,Tedious and difficult,"The film, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes is too murky to follow. Murky as to plot and scene. It is dark, obscure and one of those pretentious films critics love to tell the public merits intellectual energy and veiwer attention."
4,"Great Account, but perhaps a little fiction too.","Ironically, I finished reading this book on December 7, 1996. I realized the next day that this was the fiftieth anniversary of the great fire. Heys and Goodwin have done a fine job of telling us the story of America's worst hotel fire. But I do think they went too far in trying to convince everyone that the fire was an arson. They believe that an Atlanta criminal ignited the blaze that night. Their theory is plausable and they argue their case well, but one must remember that fire can arise from many sources. I am always suspicious of claims that a fire 'had to have been set'. But this is a minor weakness in a great work on one of America's prominent but unknown disasters."
5,Gorgeous!,"Joni is such a brilliant musician! I love her albums very much, and I'd definetly recommend ""Clouds"" for anyone who like quality, heartfelt, and intelligent music. ""That Song About The Midway"" is probably one of my favorite Joni songs ever. Such amazing artistry and detail. Great work, Buy it now!"
3,"Ho hum, snore, wake me up when it's over","I've been using Leslie Sansone workouts for a year now and, while I adore her, am trying to find a little variety. Because I am a choreo klutz and can't do dancey videos my choices are limited, so I was excited to find this DVD. Unfortunately, this workout was a complete bore to me and I couldn't even finish it. Under the theory that any movement is better than no movement, and because the workout might be enjoyable to others, I'll give it 3 stars for effort."
3,Debbie -- Give us one with more music and less talking,"The workout is great. Love the form tips and the flow of the training. But, PLEASE, give us an alternate side of your CD with about 80% less talking. We can't concentrate on the music beat because there is just too much chatter."
1,Almost all marching,She just marches almost the whole time. I couldn't believe it. I've done several walking tapes and have never done one where the person just marches 80% of the time! Denise Austin's Walking tape is terrific. Buy that one.
4,Good product..,"I ordered the Lilac color. It is a little light but gives a nice shimmer to your lips. Cap clicks on, so no worry about loosing it."
2,a nice red,"this is pretty good, colour was better than expected, will most likey buy it again , so would reccomend this for customeres to buy"
4,book review,"book was not ""new"" condition it appeared to be saying.It may have been close to ""like new"" but that is different than what I interpret as ""new"""
1,Lead Singers should be awake during concerts!,"Opinions: I was rather amazed to hear this live set of Manfred Mann's Earth Band. The jams feel uninspired. The instruments tend to just disappear into darkness. The vocal stylings are struggling to sound enthusiastic. Even the audience sounds like they left the arena after the announcement, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, Manfred Mann's Earth Band.""The reason why I bought this was because I thought a band that could create that inventful instrumentation in the middle of their cover, Blinded by the Light, could be a band that may have some good live stuff.I was wrong.I think everyone was wrong here.I have listened to this CD possibly three times in order to give it a decent chance at survival.It's not good.Buy something else with your money."
3,sizes run small,huggies actually kept my baby drier than swaddler (pampers baby dry feels rough). but the sizes run smaller than the same size pampers. i used size1 huggies as NB diapers. he has outgrown size1 huggies but can still use size1 pampers. another annoying thing (and could be the reason why other's are leaking) is that the blue gathering is stuck together to the diaper and so you have to pull it off each time so that you have two layers of protection. what a pain in the butt...literally.
3,Vintage Cohen,"More than once I've read poetry by favorite musicians and though, ""Oh. Without music, this isn't very good."" But Cohen was a writer first--the strength of his songs has always been the lyrics. This book is a collection of both poetry and lyrics (and a little poetic prose). It's vintage Cohen--dark and passionate and violent and melodramatic. It's about torrid love affairs and failed marriages and betrayal and war. If you like Cohen's lyrics, you'll like these poems, though you won't find any departures here."
4,songs and poems,"Some people who listen to Leonard Cohen's music hardly realize that he was (or is) well-known as a poet for a very long time. There was a real tradition of songwriters who were poets, especially starting back in the '50s and '60s, like Bob Dylan, Allen Ginsberg, Jim Morrison, etc. I think Cohen's classic work however is ""Beautiful Losers"", especially excerpts like ""All Right, Edith"" and ""Believe Me, Edith"". It's in here. As well as lotsa poems and the lyrics to some of his songs that pass for poetry.David Rehakauthor of ""Poems From My Bleeding heart"""
5,wonderful book on extreme sports enthusiasts,"A vivid and exciting look at the lives and exploits of 'brave men', a group who challenge mortality with their courage on the race-track and in the rodeo arena."
5,One of the Most Beautiful Ocean DVD's Ever!,"I love this DVD! The ocean photography is absolutely gorgeous... and the music and natural sounds are so soothing and beautiful. This DVD has two separate soundtracks - one with music and natural sounds... and the other with NATURAL SOUNDS OF THE OCEAN ONLY!(The other reviewer might need to learn how to use his DVD player...it even says so right on the box!) Personally I prefer the beautiful acoustic guitar and piano music mixed with the natural sounds the best. But sometimes, I just play the DVD with the sounds of the ocean only. It's very relaxing that way. I found the vivid color, excellent quality, and gentle slow motion to really add to the overall sensual impression of the Pacific Ocean that this wonderful DVD evokes. The quality of my DVD was superb. ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES!"
4,Watch out for that tiny flash,"I cannot say that this camera is bad but for the one year that I owned it, I keep wishing that I can attached a bigger and brighter flash for the indoor group shots. It does everything exceptionally well outdoor however, the indoor group shots is off the mark for insufficient flash... the pictures of group shot look dark and a bit out of focus on the outer edge. The lack of hot shoe and the lack of external flash terminal make indoor photographers, like myself, aching for more...If you never have to do indoor photo of more than two or three persons in a groupd then it is a camera for you.If you are serious, check out Canon G2 or Nikon 5000. Both has all you ever wanted in a digital camera."
3,Glossy Indigo Blue 1 cup Ramekins - not colbalt blue,"These ramekins were not the color I believed them to be. You see, I have bought several pieces a few years back in a deep blue, more like colbalt blue. I wanted these ramekins to match them and thought that they would given their name, but they were a shade or two off/lighter. Only for that reason was I not happy with them and also the stupid label they plaster at the bottom of each one. I ended up giving them as a Christmas gift to my newly married neice and she liked them alot. Chantal makes a good product, I just wish they still made these in the color that I needed. I have them in a 1/2 cup ramekin, but wanted them in a 1 cup."
4,One step beyond...,"This CD is awesome. It sounds wonderful, and the music still stands up 20+ years later. I love it as much today as I did when I bought it on vinyl."
4,Old music that does not age,"I am 53 years old and just the past few months started listening to SKA. Maybe out of my love for Sublime and because my 19 year old son loved SKA so much before he was taken from me. Anyway, this CD is great. I plan to purchase another one or two. The beat is always uplifting, but not annoying like some. You can turn it up or down, it is just good."
4,Nice Christmas patterns,Quite a few intricate plastic canvas patterns of general Christmas themes but on the whole a very nice pattern laden book.
4,Informative,I bought this book a few years ago while completing my Masters in Education. Let's just say this isn't a book I wanted to return back to the bookstore. I STILL have this book as a reference because of the valuable information.
5,"genuflect, TL lives","To an aging pre-hippie who enjoyed this stuff the first time around its amazing how well it holds up over the years. Whats more, my Lehrer naive family, including the younger generation, can relate to the human foibles gently skewered within. Its not just nostalgia - funny then, funny now."
3,Never a Lady,"As part of a character building ""task"" imposed by her father, Virginia Blair travels from America to England with her stepmother Rowena to live among proper society. This doesn't sit well with Maximilian Chartwell who is in charge of protecting the young Esmond, Duke of Penrose. Rowena would like nothing more than to see Virgie married to Esmond, but Virgie stuns everyone by declaring she will marry for nothing less than love. Opportunity may knock, but the characters here don't quite know when to answer the door. The characters were so wrapped up in concern for themselves that they seemed to forget about each other in the process. This reviewer saw no sympathy for any of them, and wondered, quite frankly, about the relationships among the characters and the relations between America and Britain in the mid 19th century."
3,Lighter weight than I anticipated.,"These work fine, but they are lighter in weight than I would have thought considering their price and Wilton's blurb on them."
5,Great Iced tea!!!,"My family and I have been using this tea for over 40 years. I make the best unsweetened tea I've ever had with this tea, and get many many compliments on it. If you use good water, this tea will last for a day or two without refrigeration, which changes it's flavor. I am in South Texas and we take our tea very seriously down here. This strong, brisk, hearty brew is just the thing on a hot summer afteroon. I haven't experienced stained teeth or other ill effects, either. Using a drip coffee maker to brew it keeps it from overheating and getting bitter. It's healthy, too, with plenty of antioxidants in it's orange/black pekoe blend. If you try it and it's too strong, tinker with your recipe. Once you get the ratio right, you'll find it is delicious."
1,Get better quality tea for less $$!,"Lipton does taste good but it's not a good quality tea! If you open the tea bag you'll see their not tea leaves but tea dust (cheep). Even the loos lipton tea is described as being ""broken down so you need a fine filter to strain it."" When you steep good tea it should unfurl and look like spinach!They say this tea comes to $0.57 an oz?!?!?! Lets do the math. $27.54 devided by 8oz = $3.44.I buy my tea from Set to a Tea [...]). It's really good tea with flavoring and dried fruit pices. It comes to $3 an oz for a tin or $2.57 for a refill. Weather you buy it loose or in bags you get the same quality tea! I went to a tea party last year (like a tupperware party but more fun) where the chick told us all about the different kinds of tea and gave us samples."
4,Best Spice Girls Song,I bought this CD just because of the Spice Girls song...I can't believe it was never released as a single.
3,phantom planet,"This CD is not that good. The Phantom Planet song ""So I Fall Again"" is the best on the CD. The Bens Fold Five song is second best."
4,The Real Mac,"I purchased this when it was released ... way back when vinyl ruled - but the CD hasn't got the crackly bits in the silent parts of ""Oh Well"".This was recorded when Fleetwood Mac was still a band of integrity rather than a slave to pop. Sure, some people find a couple of these tracks an acquired taste - but they grow on you... Personally I never had that problem - this is a wonderful album - musical, exciting, nostalgic.It reminds me of pool games and pork chops in the old Morning Star Hotel (alas, long since a victim to the demolition ball), and long drives in my old side-valve Humber ... But more than that, it reminds me of an era of good, honest music. Buy this one - you can't go wrong!"
3,"... in response to ""gigilastic""","I have been buying huggies diapers since I had my 8 month old daughter and I loved them... and I am just now seeing the ""giglastic waistband"" on the packages... I believe that these are the new ones, not the ""triple protection and absorbent gel"" ones that ""NEW MOM"" mentioned. I am also not happy with the giglastic ones. I liked the thicker waistband on other ones. I haven't bought the diapers from amazon, I was just checking prices... and I guess I am going to keep buying them at Wal-Mart because they are cheaper before coupons!"
2,Too much walking in place,"The first half of the AM workout is mostly marching in place. The moves got more interesting in the 2nd half, but it was way too much walking in place. I don't think I'll ever do this workout again."
1,Missing half of Vol. 9,"Bushido volume 9 might be the best MMA card ever put on, and this box set comes with it.So what's the issue you ask? Well, half of the event is missing. You can only see the first have of Bushido 9 on the disc that comes in this box set."
2,Kitty Will Not Use,Kitty thought it was a fun toy but would not usethe box for its Iintended purpose. Had to put thekitty litter back into her plastic box and she washappy again.
5,Convenient!,"I've purchased these cat box liners for over a year now. These are the best solution that I've been able to find, to make an unpleasant chore as quick and painless as possible. Fill the liner with your favorite litter. At the end of the week, simply lift it out and toss it into a trash bag and dispose. Rinse out your plastic litter box and give it a quick scrub with cheap children's shampoo. Using this product, your hands ( and nose! ) have the least possible time in contact with the cat's wastes.I've tried a variety of plastic and bag type liners, as well as a robotic rake for crystal litter. Very tough heavy duty ""egg carton"" type material. Holds up even when dealing with a great deal of urination from two cats. I can recommend these to any cat owner."
5,great for a humid climate,This really helps the clumps dry out and makes them easy to remove. I use these like a liner in side a plastic pan because I keep the litter in an unconditioned space.
4,Excellent Product,We have 3 Cats. The Wonderbox makes cleaning the Litter Boxes much easier. The bag type liners need replaced every day. Wonderbox can be used for a month or more.
4,Better than I'd hoped,"I bought these in a store right before leaving town for a family emergency, so I knew they were a bit too small (the store only had medium), but with two cats, one of whom will gladly urinate alongside the litter box to make sure I know his opinion about the cleanliness of it, I had to have more boxes in my house while I was gone. I normally scoop four times a day, but my cat sitter would be coming by only twice each day.The boxes held up beautifully. All three lasted the ten days I was gone. I bought a giant box of cheap litter, since I couldn't afford that much of the Precious Cat (Precious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter, 40 pound bag) stuff that I usually use, so there were some odor issues, but that's the fault of the litter, not the box.These were great back-up boxes, and I will gladly use them again (although I'd rather order them from Amazon in order to have a choice of size - my cats are a little big for the medium)."
5,these boxes are great,"have allergies, so have to ""manage"" litter box process well. these are great -- I line the litter box, then put one of these inside (on top of liner) and fill with litter -- usually lasts a couple weeks and then replace the whole thing and it is easy and cleaner process for me. Also great for taking kitty with us for weekend when we visit family -- portable litter box and kitty is familiar with it."
3,Still a basic source for historic Chinese phonology,"This book of Karlgren is outdated in many aspects: full of mistakes and the general methodical framework employed is pre-structuralist: With the methods now available the result of his attempt to reconstruct Old and Middle Chinese would be far more accurate. Nevertheless this book is a must for everyone interested in the history of the Chinese language, the vast amount of material collected and categorised in this book is still very valuable."
5,Tom Lehrer,Product was as advertized & came on time. I thought I would never find it. Thanks for finding it for me.
5,I bought it for a second time for my Dad!,"Very lovely and soothing songs from yesterday! My Mom and Dad went on a trip with us and we listened to the entire set as we were riding in the car. Dad said that he would like to have those songs and I could get the CD set for him for Christmas, so I did."
4,12,"Twelve well written,clever storiesI just wonder if they are completely fiction.Did Doyle read the newspapers Holmes did andBase those stories on the news articles?"
4,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Illustrated),"An enjoyable, fun read of a number of short stories of a variety of different puzzles presented as mysteries. Good introduction to deductive reasoning."
4,Classic,"This is classic. I love these amazing stories, and the beautiful illistrations just add so much to this beloved book."
4,Great version,Just love Sherlock and this is a great version including the original illustrations.includes a couple of stories that I have not read before.
4,Great short stories,"I ""bought"" this to try out the Kindle app for Blackberry. The stories are short enough to enjoy when you have a few minutes of ""alone time"" to read. I only made it through the first three stories and they were well written and well produced in this format."
4,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,A great compilation of thought provoking and wonderfully entertaining mystery short stories. It is highly recommended.
5,Great read.,"I absolutely LOVED this book. The comical satire of Holmes makes this book entirely worthwhile to read. The mysteries presented pose no challenge for Holmes, but are always figured out at the last minute. This is one of my favorite books of all time."
4,Is anyone reading Sherlock Holmes on Kindle seeing typos?,I enjoy reading Sherlock Holmes. But I am having issues with a lot of typos. It seems whenever monetary units are used they appear as garbled symbols(#$@). It's like watching cable tv and seeing pixelation on the screen. It is really annoying. Is anyone else having this problem?
3,Technical glitches in this Kindle edition,"All of the numeric entries in the text are garbled, so if you don't care whether they're referring to 20 pounds or 3000, you'll be fine. of course it's a free download, so I'm not complaining."
5,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"Twelve brilliant stories! I loved this book! It was exciting, mysterious and thrilling! An absolute classic! Sherlock Holmes' stories are the best detective tales EVER! Wonderfully written!"
5,Classic,A truly great read from a great writer of another age. not to be missed. to be read and reread all your life
4,Bad characters,"There is problem with the sign of pound ' - should be easy to correct. Otherwise it's good. I was amazed, that teh actual story is so good and easy to read"
4,Holmes and Watson,"This is an well known and entaining collections of mysteries to be solved by our colleagues in crime.I found the illustations disappointing when introduced into the Kindle environment because they are rendered(black and white).Perhaps if they were line drawings they would be more suitable to the Kindle situation.As for the text, it is pure Conan Doyle, always appreciated by his adherents."
5,Classic!,Fantastic classic mystery thrillers. If you've not read them yet. You're in for a real treat! Highly recommend them. Timeless!
2,great content but data missing,Started reading this ebook with great excitement but there is no content after page 27location 1071 it broke the continuityand i stopped reading it.please fix it otherwise wonderful book
2,Save your 99 Cents,"Kindle for iPhone/iPad version:When I purchased this version of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, I thought the illustrations were mainly by Sidney Paget and reproductions of The Strand Magazine Sherlock Holmes stories. What I got were some Sidney Paget illustrations, color photos, and pictures from the latest Sherlock Holmes movie. The photos really detract from the stories. Save your 99 cents and buy the ""The Original Illustrated Sherlock Holmes"" for $9.99 in the paper version for a real Sherlock Holmes experience as they were published."
5,I'm looking forward to their next adventures.,A timeless set of mysteries from before the days of forensic science. Easy read and enjoyable short stories.
4,The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes,"The stories are very interesting. I enjoy seeing how he ""reads"" people and things and is able to solve mysteries."
5,Wonderful!,"This is a wonderful e-book. The short stories are perfect for on the go.I love the stories. They are fun, witty, mysterious, and of coarse Mr. Holmes is a joy to read.I can't believe the price. This is the best deal (free) I have ever found."
3,Good in its day,"This book was indispensible when it was first published. Though there were numerous ommissions, and possibly a few errors, the editors of this work did far more than yeoman's work in the compilation. Unfortunately, a decade has passed since publication and no update has been forthcoming, making it of little more use than a 10 year old computer reference manual would be. The information presented is mostly accurate, but is now woefully outdated."
5,Priceless,THe words and music to this wonderful albulm remain a part of every listener's conscience for the rest of his or her life. A must for every human being.
5,**Wonder Woman Season **1 on DVD is Wonderful,Well Wonder Woman fans we have waited a long time to get this series released onto DVD and now finally it's here and it was well worth the wait and money. The Quality is extremely high and now we need to pressure warner brothers to release Season two and Season Three cause it is a collection I'm sure all of of want.The first season starts out with the 90 minute pilot and then takes us through aall the episodes with Diana in the Army as well as the two episodes that have Debra Winger as Wonder Girl and also the two part Judgement from Outer Space Episodes with Wonder Woman teaming up with Andros her pal from outer space.All I can say is I hope Warner Releases Season two and Three cause I'll be first in line to buy them both. It is a must have for any serious collector or Wonder Woman fan.This first Season gets two thumbs up from this Wonder fan.
1,"YOUR A WONDER ,WONDER WOMAN!!!!!!","Thank Hera !!!! The gods have finally sent us WONDER WOMAN on dvd. I have been waiting years for this. When I was a young buck the family would go out to dinner but gave it up because Wonder Woman was on Sat night. There were no vcr's at that point. My very constant concern that any yummy part of the show which might be missed ,would throw me in a big freak out mode. Even at 33 years old it still makes me tingle down to my inner core to see the fireball and new outfit. A must have . In fact get 2 copies in case one gets hurt. Lynda Carter would make a gay guy go straight. Ba DA Bing !!!!"
2,"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Fibromyalgia, 2nd edition","I did not learn anything from this book, pretty much all common sense. It was a waste of my time."
1,Not recommended by this father,"Huggie Supremes do not work on my daughter at all, the back of the diapers constantly ""open up"" allowing anything inside the diaper to leak out. Was a messy 42 diapers."
4,A Fine Album From Metal Year 1984,"Black N Blue were a young band from Oregon that never achieved big success despite possessing very mature songwriting talents. I first discovered them when I saw the video for the classic Hold On To 18! I seem to recall that lead vocalist Jaime St. James was still wearing braces. This album contains several great songs that I never get tired of hearing. My favorites are Strong Will Rock, Hold On To 18, Wicked Bitch, One For The Money, and Chains Around Heaven (excellent!). There is also a good cover of Sweet's ""Action"". Their next album, Without Love, is also a good album but I started to lose interest with Nasty Nasty. As many fans probably already know, guitarist Tommy Thayer is currently playing Ace's role in Kiss. A new Black N Blue album is expected some time in the near future. If you can find this cd used grab and crank it!"
3,Not much clinical data,"This is mostly a group of stories about people who took this drug. Not much useful clinical information about the drug itself. For a patient, this book is fine. For a doctor, you won't learn much. No complaints about the seller."
2,Did not work in my house,"I have a big house and my existing WAP was not covering all of it. Rather than try a range extender or antenna, I bough this, hoping that the new technology could ""curve"" around my house.The installation was simple and my one question was answered perfectly by tech support.But, after 3 days of using it, I am going to return it and replace my old wap.The problem is an interment latency. I know little about this new technology, but it seems like it goes down for a bit while it tries to find a new path. I use it primarily one room away; my old WAP did fine to this room, but I have experienced a number of timeouts trying to access a webpage while it is down (low signal) for a few seconds. This is also a problem for streaming.Perhaps this is the 1.0 version of this product; I defiantly want to get a more powerful WAP for my house because I want to start using wireless audio and other toys, but this did not work for me."
1,Shudda listened to the reviewers,"Linksys Wireless-G Broadband Router(WRT54GX2) - read the reviews referencing poor product quality but liked the form fit & function of this router, especially the wall mount option. Frankly, it fit better in the work space and looked better than the typical Linksys WRT54G product.Mistake - I spent about 5 hours setting up, troubleshooting with the online tools, holding and talking with Linksys tech support. The tech support folks were very courteous and seemed to know their stuff and ultimately concluded this router was a dud and I should return it (and have).Rather than risk further frustration or cross the review gods again, I went out the next day and purchased aLinksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router with SpeedBoosterand was up and running in an under an hour with 3 computers on the network. It may not look as nice and takes up more space but it sure does work . . ."
5,Solved my problem...,"I had an older Linksys product and considered buying an antenna to extend its range. Read about MIMMO technology and decided to try it. I installed it fairly quickly and both my laptops work well with it. It more than doubled the signal I was getting at the other end of my house. BTW, I'm a moderately computer savvy girl."
1,Twice Smitten,I bought this Linksys router on the advice of a salesman at CompUSA. It was what I was looking for and I had had success with Linksys products in the past. Not this time. I could not get any of Linksys software to recognize the router. Couldn't ping the router either. Tech support said it was defective so I returned it to CompUSA. Tried again with no success and called tech support (4th actual call). They said it was another defective router. Two off of the shelf defective! Needless to say returned for a refund.
2,Works good for computers...,"...but doesn't work very well with an XBOX 360. This router is not XBOX Live compatible. We have three XBOX 360s in our house and if we play online together, it lags badly. We bought a WRT54GS and it works just as well as this, plus it's fifteen dollars cheaper. I wouldn't recommend buying this."
1,Problems,I have been using this router for a month but it has been nothing but problems. I contacted Linksys and they replaced it with a refurbished unit. The main issue I have is the latency on the device. Tonight I noticed that Linksys had a firmware update and tried it too but still it is worthless to me. When using VOIP or playing BF2 the latency causes interruptions and drops. I started pinging the interface with a directly attached PC and laptop. The response time goes from 1ms to 1000ms and timeouts at times. I would not recommend this device.
2,A disappointment,A very ambient album. Nowhere near as groovy or acid-jazzy as their other work (which I really dig). A good album to put on if you want to fall asleep.
3,Unsettling,"This is a weird record. On the one hand, it's got some fantastic tunes, such as ""I Just Wanna Have Something to Do"", ""I Wanted Everything"" and ""I Wanna be Sedated"" -- but it's also has some truly horrible, misguided songs that reek of parody (""I'm Against It"", ""Go Mental"") or, worse yet, expose the band's limited reach (the cringe-worthy ballad ""Questioningly""). Plus, although this was only the 4th album, the boys sound jaded and more than a tad bored for much of this -- and I'm not talking about the ironic boredom of the detached hipster pose of the first couple of records, either. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted...."
3,"A good primer on the case, but flawed","Based on scanty evidence, conjecture, and conspiracy theories, Arnold Brown suggests that Lizzie Borden had an illegitimate half-brother, and he did the deed, and that Lizzie went on trial to protect him. (I am not giving anything away here; the brother is fingered from the outset.) Everything that followed the murders, Brown says, was planned by the authorities--from the inquest to the trial to the acquittal. The reader has to be careful to distinguish between fact and Brown's opinions, because it isn't always clear which is which. On the other hand, because of its photographs, transcripts and analysis of key testimony, the book is a must for any Lizzie Borden aficionado, but is best leavened with other more objective accounts of the murders. I wish Arnold Brown had written a book about the murders *before* he discovered the ""new evidence"" he touts so much."
5,"if you know kevin, and like kevin...this is for you.","i have an evening with kevin smith one and two. i must say, three is the same sort of thing. i would send granma from the room, but he's full of delightful stories about his life as only he can tell it."
5,"Very great threequal, only not quite as good as the other two.","I really enjoyed this DVD, although it was not quite as good as the first two, the first one being my favorite, but it was still highly entertaining. You can never go wrong with Kevin Smith. Also check out Zack and Miri Make a Porno in theaters now!!!"
1,There is one secret......,"This DVD has very little to offer and even at its attractive price, it's a waste of money. Granted, I have done reading on meditation for years and have practiced sporadically. Still, I don't believe you could get much less from a DVD than is available on this one. There are detailed instructions on posture, hand position and the like. That takes about three minutes. I was very disappointed in the lack of in-depth instruction I would have expected from a DVD on meditation."
4,"Hey, Baby, I hear the blues a callin'...","...tossed salads and scrambled eggs! I love Frasier! This season wasn't as easy for the writers on Frasier. They had to work in Jane Leeves real-life pregnancy, but that worked in their favor in the end since they were able to make it seem like she was just getting fat to avoid consumating her relationship with Niles. They padded her up nicely, too, so she didn't just look like they were covering up a pregnant belly - she looked bigger all around.I liked the whole season, but it lacked a certain something - I think the decrease in Niles and Frasier's time together on the show has put a bit of a damper on things. Since Niles and Daphne's relationship progressed, though, it was only natural that it would happen.Still, great season! I love the whole show, and I will always be a Frasier fanatic!"
5,Frazier 8th season,"I enjoy the conveinece of ordering on line, having my credit card info already in place and shipping usualy free with $25 purchase. The DVD arrived in a few days and we enjoyed it very much!"
4,The Last Watchable Frasier,"I have been a fan of Frasier from the start. It was great, funny, and had what I like to call spontaneous comedy. I continued to have this opinion until the end of season 8. After season 8, Frasier lost it's charm. It became dull and predictable. Almost like a broken record or a bad soap opera. Season 8 gave us one last chance to enjoy a great comedy with great episodes like the Butler, the Actor,the Lawyer, the dual Frasier where he gets turned down by his date infront of everybody. Glad that I have season 8. Final note: Frasier should have closed the curtain after season 8."
5,Splendid .A joy to watch,"Really quite splendid. The recording the singing (ALL excellent) and like a good old British pantomime. My only critisism was Juan Diego's costume, looked a bit like a skirt .Overall Excellent!!!Very highly recommended"
1,Very Bad and Misleading.,"This book was slapped together to make a fast buck. If you know absolutely NOTHING about directing or video, this book might be for you. If you have spent a few minutes searching the internet, then there will already be very little it can teach you. If you are still thinking about buying this book, take a look at some of the better reviews. Do they seem like they were written by someone like me or you? I took the time to check them out: one of the reviewers wrote about every single title released by NRP on the subject. I wonder what kind of costumer this is... Some other reviews have tried to lead us into thinking that the book appropriately addresses its target reader: the absolute beginner. This is an obvious attempt at justifying its lack of content. Fortunately, I read a borrowed copy and saved my money."
4,Great start to learn to speak Greek!,"These CDs are a great start to learning modern Greek. I thought I was hopeless! This is really helpful if you are planning to travel to Greece, but you will definitely need other books/tapes if you are trying to learn more than just how to ask directions, ask for something to drink, etc. One negative that a native speaker pointed out to me is that you only learn the ""formal"" version of a lot of things (I'm only half-way through though, so maybe they teach informal tenses later). Overall a great experience as long as you make sure to do it frequently and repeat lessons to make sure you know everything before you move on. Definitely worth the price and you can rip them onto your mp3 player so it's more convenient!"
4,fun and interesting,"Have always learned languages grammar first. This eschews that method, and I am enjoying memorization, and learning the phonemic components of Greek. Minuses - no text book: I would like to be able to read Greek, as well, and must search for other sources. It's a good first start!"
1,Pseudo Psychology,I bought this book with high hopes based on the reviews at Amazon but I reckon they must have been written by the author - 'cos the book is rubbish.
1,Does anyone have a copy that works?,"I've ordered this DVD twice from Amazon, and both times, the disc would not work on any of my 4 DVD Players. Are there any copies of this DVD that actually play, or are they all defective?"
3,Still testing it out...,I loved the idea of taking liquid magnesium...I get very anxious and tense. I hoped this would be a miracle for me but I haven't seen any difference yet. The flavor is ok--it's pretty chaulky but that's to be expected. The serving size seems large...taking it every day would last me like 2 weeks. I wish the bottle were bigger.
5,great company,Our order was delivered promptly and was in the condition described. I would order from them again!
5,Awesome CD,"I'd been a Blind Melon fan for years without knowing this single existed. But I'm glad I found it. The CD contains 1) Change, 2) Changed, 3) No Rain [Ripped Away Version], 4) Candy Says [Country Jellyfish Version] and 5) Paper Scratcher [Acoustic]. Changed is essentially a different version of Change with alternate lyrics which runs the same length, whereas Candy Says is a cover of a Velvet Underground song about a transvestite. The Ripped Away Version of No Rain contained here is also different and shorter than the Ripped Away Version found on Nico. As far as I know, these songs can't be found anywhere else and, thus, make the single a good buy for any fan or collector. This same Acoustic version of Paper Scratcher, however, can be found on the 4-song Deep Cuts digital download here on Amazon."
3,What Poe's Got to do with this book?,"I loved Mr. Taylor's first book, the iridiscent Caroline Miniscule. I have tried to read his 'village mysteries' and found them rather heavy going. I just loved Quincunx (by Charles Palliser). I am surprised at some of the rave reviews this book is getting.The atmosphere is fine, the characters, especially the women are predictable. Edgar Allan Poe is a small boy and the mystery involves his buddy's family. What's the point of making such a noise about Poe in this book? This is one of my main bones of contention with the book. The other is the over writing that has become the hallmark of most writers. Yes, I did read the entire An Instance of the Fingerpost, a much superior thriller. An average Regency mystery. I got tired of the repeated 'thrashing' of the students. So got the Crime Dagger for the best Historical Mystery! Left me quite cold."
3,An Unpardonable Crime,"I had already read this book under the title of The American Boy. After I started reading it and discovered this, I returned it."
3,Good for a kid...,"We purchased this for my son's first grade book report. It was a book that I had to read to him, and the reason I gave it an ""okay"" rating, is because, if you are an adult having to read the book to your child, it can get a bit slow. My son enjoyed discussing the detective elements of the story, but the story tended to drag at parts with different smaller stories inside of the main story. I don't know if it would have captivated his imagination to keep him reading on his own. It was a pretty good story, but not a page turner."
5,"Walter Brooks had a genius for character, even animal.","The Freddy the Pig adventures are almost unique in children's literature. Few series, whether for children or adults are so full of the sense of community, and the character's place in that community than the Freddy books are. I've just reread six of them (two aloud) with my children. I'm amazed to find that you can read this series, end to end, in much the same way that you would read Trollope's Barchester novels, or Anthony Powell's Dance---as life caught in microcosm, studied, and loved and laughed at, and to hell with the fact that these are animals. I step off the subway each day and enter an office that is remarkably like Freddy's world, except we have few adventures. These are great books and I hope the publisher will find a ready audience for them."
3,Hmmmm Interesting..........,This one is a hard to grade album in the Dave Weckl era. Great Drumming in and out in this album as you can imagine. This album definately is a turn off though. I hate to say it but Dave is gonna have to pull some strings to get back ontop. The song's on this album are as cheesy as they get. It doesn't even sound like something Dave weckl would put his time into. Access Denied is a great song but that is the only real turn on about the album. A very poor exhibition for great talent.
4,Pleasantly surprised ;-),This cd isn't half bad. I've loved Peter Gallagher ever since I first saw him in While You Were Sleeping right through to Center Stage and now of course The O.C. But I never knew he could sing. He's got quite a good voice and the songs he's done suit him well. I particularly love When Something Is Wrong With My Baby and Still Got The Blues. I recommend this cd for anyone who loves smooth jazz sounding type songs and if they prefer them sung by a nice vocalist.
3,Refresher,Written in his normal manner the Eight Piecss of Brocade povides a good refresher on techniques. Although I learned from a differnt school the bool provided some insights that I had missed.
1,A Lot of Hype,"I found that just drinking 8-16oz of water alone before a big meal has helped me to lose 10lbs this month alone, and it's FREE! I didn't really notice that much of a difference when taking TrimSpa, I really think it's the water that makes you feel fuller!"
1,This stuff really works!,"I weighed 188-189 pounds and I needed to lose about 8-9 pounds. I was taking other pills, but all they did was make me feel all hyper and gittery, I hated it. Since I started taking TrimSpa about 2 months ago, I am now down to 177 pounds and I feel great. I can't say my appetite went away, but I do get fuller more quickly, nor did I feel I had more energy, but I did lose the weight."
2,No results,I have been using this now for awhile and haven't seen results. I haven't been AS hungry but definately lost any weight.
3,Good but not portable at all,"I bought these speakers for my laptop since they were advertised as ""portable"" but they are not portable at all. In fact they are bigger than the speakers I use on my desktop computer. The sound is ok, but not great for desktop speakers. Anyway, if you are looking for portable speakers this is not it because they are aprox. 4""W x 4.5""D x 8.25""H. I am only keeping them because shipping them back will cost too much."
1,bracelet,"I never received this product, it got lose in the mail according to USPS and the bracelet company. I am very upset because I really wanted this bracelet."
3,njaeh,"This is an album for Vinnie fans. They will probably not be disappointed, why so, I will describe further down. For newcomers, I would personally recommend Stings ""Ten summoner's tale's"", where Vinnie really shines and lives up to his reputation as a great drummer, with his unique style.When it comes to Vinnie, there's a certain fanaticism among some, not to say, a lot, of his fans. I've tried to make the point earlier that one should be able to listen critically, even, if it's Vinnie. It's not about fancy chops itself. It's about the power of that tight tight groove, wich lifts not only your feet from the floor, but also lifts the whole song up. Fast fills and intricate patterns have nothing in itself to do with that."
1,Not for a classroom of students,I got this video in hopes of showing it to my 2nd grade students when introducing Monet. Unfortunately I was not able to show it because it is really inappropiate for an audience of students - lots of violence and language. I just thought I'd help out other art teachers - not appropriate for an audience of kids...
3,Akira (Special Edition),"Eventhough,the art of anime had advanced considerably. This landmark Anime film still entertains. However,the DVD,I received had periods where it seemed to halt momentarily. But,it didn't take away from the films enjoyment."
3,Depth in anime...,"To do the lengthy Akira graphic novel series complete justice would require a Peter Jackson-like effort in a series of movies. Nonetheless, this anime does a decent job of taking us into the world of Neo Tokyo. Much oif the overall story is missing, but I did love the direction of this film.I saw this movie when it was first released in the US years ago and even today I still fondly recall those flashback scenes of Tetsuo and Kaneda growing up together, best friends always, yet doomed to their tragic conflict.I'm the kind of fan who always opts to watch anime in the original Japanese with English subtitles. You get more of the intended emotions from the voice actors that way I find.Past editions of Akira in English were down right boring because of the dubbing. The new edition is better, but I still prefer to watch it in Japanese."
3,I Want the Original English Back,"Or at least as an option. That's strange to say considering the original was Japanese, but you know what I mean. The voices don't have the unique sound each did on the VHS version. Now it's hard to tell who's talking much of the time. It sure looks good and this DTS DVD is the best of the current releases, but I want to hear ""Tetsuooooo!"" screamed like I remember it."
3,Why Pioneer why??????????,"Ok the DVD is great wipes the floor with the VHS version but some of the diolouge changed and the voice overs are different but in a way it wasn't needed all they had to do was transfer the old VHS movie to the DVD without re-releasing to movie in theaters in 2001, so I liked the old VHS version better but this is a good start for anybody just begining to enter into the world of Japanese Animation enjoy."
3,WHAT IS THIS?,"It has great animation, but the storyline could have been explained a whole lot better. And is it me, or is the ending a bit drawn out?"
5,AKIRA the movie of the year,"this movie has it all. Action, supence, and everything else. Get this movie if you can. if you like manga this is your movie get it as soon as possible"
5,akira the anime king,akira a violent but a anmie classic it has a story not like must anmies do. A story of friendship hatred @science .THE story a biker riding for fun until TETSUO gets hit by a kid then tested on by lab men.THEN he is sent to the hostpitle.THEN youll have to watch the rest by your self.WARING partens are EXTMELY !CAUTIONED.GRAPHIC VIOLENCE NUDITY DRUG CONTENT BLOOD ADULT LANGUAGE. ...
5,THE anime film,"The one which no anime has since surpassed, the standard bearer, the inspiration the one which, over a decade later, is still the best.The art of anime may have improved, but in terms of story, characters and direction, nothing compares to Akira - the godfather of anime films. To be honest, its difficult to see how, in the space of two hours, an anime film could be made that could better this in terms of story and structure. A century from now, when anime is written about, it is akira that will be cited as the ""capolavoro"" of the genre."
4,One of the best animes ever!,"Althought my item arrived before the expected time, the package content is kinda different to the photos. There is ONLY the Blu-Ray box as you can see in the image 1 of the announcement. There is no box included. The black one. I'm a little disappointed about this, but I do recommend to everybody buy this BluRay.Akira is the movie that motivated me to start to watch animes, so it's a perfect reference of all best ingredients for a marvelous anime."
2,Akira: The Not-So-Special Edition,"At first, I was anxious to see all the new features and deleted scenes from one of my favorite anime flicks, and I was, until I actually watched the movie. While the graphics have improved greatly over the VHS, the new dubbing of vocals and sound effects are just inexcusable. It just doesn't have the same gritty feel of the original traslation. It seems like the traslators are more interested in fitting new words to the mouths of the characters than they are in staying true to the mood of the original. Furthermore, most of the voices sound like they were done by boys who are just reaching puberty...."
1,Look elsewhere to feed your anime need,"Gah, I couldn't believe I paid money for this garbage. I heard a lot of hype about how awesome it was, so I figured it would be worth my while. I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I couldn't make any sense of the story (or lack thereof). Characters show up and you have no idea who they are, where they came from, or why they're in the movie. All I could figure out was that at some point Tokyo was nuked and Neo Tokyo was rebuilt in the resulting crater, and it's a really screwed up world to live in. Do yourself a favor and find a real anime to watch."
4,"Awesome Movie, Bad Dubbing","Any Otaku who claims to be an otaku has or will see Akira. It is the pen-ultimate anime Movie, great soundtrack, great animation, and one of the coolest sci-fi stories ever. The only gripe I have with the special edition is that the dubbing is really sub-par."
4,Legendary Akira bluray,"""AKIRA"", the 1988 anime film that became the masterpiece of mangaka and director Katsuhiro Otomo.My first viewing of ""AKIRA"" was back in 1993. I have to be truthful, it was one of those films that I had to watch several times because I felt I was missing something integral. Each time I watched the film, there was always something new that I picked up and for anyone who has seen this animated film, just how much was put into the animation, the detail for an animated film.In 1988, Disney had ""Oliver & Friends"" and being touted as the first animation to utilize hand drawn art and computerized graphics and as the film incorporated some darkness that may scare the kiddies, in Japan, ""AKIRA"" was a film that would set records in the Summer and eventually get a limited release in theaters.The film would surprise and shock people because this was not a children's animation, this was geared for adults. And did it look awesome at that time!"
3,Not bad...not bad at all...,"First, I'd like to say that I do have the original VHS tape to Akira, and I loved it. I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out. But as I watched it, I did not know of the new dubbing that they did for this new DVD, and I was dissapointed, what I want to know is...why didn't they keep the old english version!! And they just had to make it widescreen!! Luckily however...they had Japanese subtitles. I would recommend this DVD to everyone if you like Japanese, and subtitles, but I would not recommend it to anyone who loved the english dub, or don't like widescreen versions for you are wasting your time, money and killing your ears."
2,???????,"Besides the impressive animation of the film (for its time), I did not enjoy this movie at all. Maybe its because I could not grasp the movie's concept. (????). Either way I recommend ""Lain"" over this! What's up with the children who obviously suffer fromprogeria? I don't get it!"
1,This is GREAT animation!?!?,"Sorry, but no, not even for the time in which it was made. The motion is not smooth between poses, and a lot of the film is just that- poses held, mouths agape, and stills panned over. That ain't animation.The story is too condensed and too unrewarding.The English voice acting is the worst- and the script itself is a lot of name's screamed back and forth, yuck. The children's voices are women scrunched up or something- it is bad.The bst scene is at the end when Kaneda's bike is all smashed up but still rolling. The otherwise cliched comic relief, cliched violence, and cliched typical Japanese delivery of puerile entertainment... -sigh-"
4,Anamated Hoorrer,"You can only see this anamated. Imagen watching someone in the rottin sewers of Japan. With almost thier whole body in the water, but only thier eyes to see above the serface and a dead rat carcasis risses up on the serface; with magets oozing out of it. And this thing is but an inch away from the persons face. I wonder if ""JackAss"" would have the nerve to do a stunt like that!''''' Anyway, as for the movie. I realy liked the movie half way up intel the antagonist mutated into a demented/gutsy grotesc jiant. That part was definitly cool but, it does leave me with a bit of a jauring fealing afterwards. But thats why I call ""Akira"" an anamated hoorrer movie. The bike sceens with the clown gang realy get me pumped. Akira is actualy a really well anamated movie evin for todays standards. Theres nothing rong with the movie, whats in Akira is all good to watch. It has an intrieging plot. Plot twists. Akira is just an aquired taist."
1,What?,"I am really stumped why people like this anime. In my personal opinion it was stupid, confusing and a waste of my time and I love anime. Though this just didn't appeal to me at all. The guy getting really big and exploding was disgusting. I mean maybe it's just me, I am not use to this old school anime. My animes are inuyasha, fruits basket, DN angel, and vampire princess miyu. I like more love stories and fantasy so if you're like me I would't even rent this anime though if you love sci-fic and confusing stuff, you'll love this one. Not for me though."
5,AKIRA - The Staple of ANIME movies,I finally found a tin copy of the Akira movie and picked it up when I first laid eyes on it. There are to many things in the special features to mention of but the film itself was worth every penny. Watching Akira I felt like visiting a different world in a different time. The city is so big and the speed of the animation is like nothing I've ever seen before. Otomo who created most of the story explains his process with an hour long interview and an important lesson in doing dynamic storylines and transferring it to a film maker's order. This film in the Anime genre is a must buy or a must steal. Just see it for yourself!
5,"Good, but the origonal was better","I love this movie, but the diggitally remasterd version wasn't as good. The picture and sound quallity was perfect, just the vocies were chnaged. I don't like the way the voice of a digimon Character being the vocice on insane Tetsuo. It doesn't work for me. but still it;s a must see"
1,Hardcore Akira fans will hate this DVD.,"This is my first review. I feel motivated to discourage people from buying this DVD. Akira has long been one of my favorite movies and I consider it a must see. It would be a good addition to any collection. However the voiceovers for this DVD have been changed as well as some of the lines, and it sucks. Akira fans will be very disappointed. Perhaps people who?ve never seen the movie won?t mind since they have no basis for comparison, but long time fans are sure to be disappointed."
3,Good but not thier best,"This band is awsome live! I saw them at the SF Scottish games in August 1998 and again in August 1999. The band really knows how to mix rock with thier bagpipes. In the year between the 2 sets I saw them they had a major change in the band changing one pipper for another and gained a fiddler. Though both shows were energitic and fun the material they played in 99 (mostly from the factory) was not as strong as thier material in 98. If you can get I suggest thier CD ""Road Kill 2"" over this CD. If you can see them live - don't think twice - just do it!"
4,Daze of grace,"This is a song by a band that uses bagpipes along with the traditional instruments. This particular song is music to my ears. Okay, I am partial to bagpipes but this is a driving song and is a very tasteful rendition of amazing grace. I think it is worthwhile to try to find this CD. Factory is reportedly a true story and is also worth listening to. These guys played at the Dog and Duck(?) Pub in Austin last year and we had a good time listening to them live."
3,"Good, not Fabulous","I've been following 7N since 1995 and have to say this is definitely not their best musical output. Kirk's lyrics for Calvin Crozier, Twelve and The Factory Song are dark, powerful and passionate, but Heroes in Tennis Shoes left me wondering what happened to the 7N I used to know. Dan on fiddle does add an element 7N lacked previously, though Neil Anderson will always be sadly missed with his penchant for improvisation on the pipes. While beautifully produced and arranged, I have to give The Factory only 3 stars."
4,Take That Back,"From British BoyBand ""Take That"" to solo stardum as a solo artist, but Mark Owen wasn't given all the credit that he diserved. He co-wrote some of the tracks on the album including the track that ""Take That"" had a hit with called ""Babe"". Also his sound is new and fresh, not like other members that decided to go solo (no names mentioned)that just don't know the meaning of originality. He's got a new ""Quere Alternate"" sound and pulls out the guitars and piano on ""Clemintine"" and hands over the strings on ""child"" and ""Green Man"". So all in all Mark, although the media seem to think he's in a dead end, has done pretty well on this album if you ask me, it's not easy to split from the U.Ks biggest boy band and still be ontop. So Mark...If your listening...We still love you and your music...Plus you're still VERY CUTE."
4,"good, but does not work in our system","This product came quickly and in good condition; however, it does not work on NuTone systems. The company was great and easy to work with. I simply returned the vacuum with no problems using the return label provided and received a full refund."
3,The lesson here: some men are not worth loving.,"The most astonishing thing about ""Kitty Foyle"" is that it was written by a man. Easy to read, fairly smooth moving, and a window into the 1930's, the book is an interesting read.BUT the character of Kitty makes me want to scream. Kitty, clearly in need of mothering, seems to be on her way to a productive life when she falls for a guy who is not man enough to stand by her. Kitty is too in love to see she is a tool and makes decisions based on what she thinks is best for her lover.It is easy to say that my negative feeling toward the character of Kitty is from the prospective of the year 2009. Perhaps, but I know for sure that my mother, born in 1910 who was a voracious reader, would have said EXACTLY the same thing."
5,Great device,"I bought this because I dislike lugging a laptop around just to deal with photo viewing, storage and simple on-the-road edits. I replaced the laptop with a Palm TX and simply transfer files from the cameras to spare SD cards then, edit/delete on the Palm (Resco Photo Viewer). We travel a lot and have used the Syncbox for about 6 gig worth of transfers so far.I only use flash card readers at both ends as I have no patience with the camera industry's lack of adherence to standards. The product works as advertised."
4,Interesting book,"This is an interesting book, especially during his discussions of his music and compositional aesthetic. I also found enlightening his opinions of Wagner and Berlioz (not good), and his chapter on the typology of music."
2,Some good information...Mostly Chessy though,"Had a few good information points, but its not a dvd I will keep in my library. It was pretty boring."
5,"Informative, stimulating, and engaging.","I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could not put it down. Rabbi Goldstein deals fairly with subjects relating to women's issues and lives. She also approaches female characters and their treatment in the Bible and tradition from a new angle. She is not radical in her feminist approach, though she is innovative. Recognizing that she uses a unique approach, Rabbi Goldstein eases the reader in to her technique, allowing the reader to adjust to a new way of approaching the Bible and tradition. This book will challenge and move you to rethink the way in which you view the Bible, women, tradition, and nature. It is a stimulating educational read. I recommend it highly."
1,100% Useless as dishwashing detergent,"This stuff is utterly useless as dishwashing detergent. I suspect that we would have better results if we used nothing at all than with this brand. It leaves a nasty cloudy film on the dishes...especially the glasses...that can not only be seen, but also felt. The glasses actually come out looking much worse than when they went in! It doesn't even come off easily when washed by hand afterward. We used if for a while and thought something was wrong with the dishwasher until we tried another brand. Tried it again when we ran out of our preferred brand the other day. We live in a part of the world where water is naturally soft, so we don't even have hard water to blame it on. Definitely not using this again. Wish I could find some other use for it...we have 3 bottles of the stuff left and I hate to just throw it out...but we will definitely never use it again for ""cleaning"" our dishes."
1,The worst!,"Your dishes will probably get cleaner without using any of this soap at all!!Even after pre-rinsing the dishes and not putting anything in dishwasher that was caked on, my dishes still came out very dirty.To me using a environmentally product on dishes that you then have to hand wash completely negates the 'environmental' aspect of using it.What a waste of water (and time! and money!). Shame on an 'environmentally conscious' company for creating such a ineffective product that leads to so much water waste.I got much better results with Ecover which proves you can use natural ingredients and still be effective."
1,On the bright side...,"They say this is safe for the environment. I say this is probably true, given how safe it is for the bits of the environment that are stuck to my plates. You can also easily overflow your dishwasher with suds if you use too much. I experimented with various amounts and couldn't find an amount that equated to getting my dishes clean, though I did find some amounts that equated to getting suds on my floor."
4,Digi-pet,"Digimon World is more or less a virtua pet for your consol, though much deeper. Your ""pet"" will evolve into cool monsters with unique fighting abilities. Your monsters evolve at regular intervals,but you must do different things if you want them to evolve into different digimon. If your looking fr head-on digimon care,this is your game,but if your just in it for the fights and cool-looking monsters,get the sequal."
5,DIGI-HISTORY IS MADE,"Digimon world is this really cool game where you can raise you Digimon, train it, and recruit other digimon. This game teaches a lot of responsibility and this is not really violent since the guys you fight just faint so parents, don't be afraid. You start out with a Digimon, Agumon or Gabumon(depending on how you answer the questions Jijimon asks you). In about 4 to 5 days, your digimon digivolves into a champion form. If you can double it's stats within 6 or 7 digi days,(you get about 9 or 10 days when you start out) you'll be granted an ultimate digimon. This is a very hard tast to acheive. This game has cool graphic, sounds, almost everything so get it. One part about it is frustrating though: your digimon ""get deleted"" after 15 to 20 digi-days. This hurts you alot if you're about to fight a boss or something. Your digimon's life depends on how well you treat it. So that's basically the scenario.This game should be in everyone's homes."
4,UNEXPECTED,I thought this game was going to be better!It's good but they don't Digivolve into how they are supposed to be and it's hard but it's good.
5,One of a Kind,"This game is one of a kind. with a unique battle system and playstyle. it trusly was a masterpiece of its time. i would defintely purchase the other digimon worlds if the gameplay was the same, but sadly it isnt. In battle u have an assortment of commands for your digimon while battling is optional. except for bosses to progress. and the graphics is just great"
4,a bad game,"To tell you the truth I think this game was really bad. I mean you could not even get agumon to digivolve to greymon.They should have it where it is like the show, where the digimon didivolve into what they are suppost to.Why would a agumon digivolve to a numemon, that is so stupid.The game is so confusing you dont even know what to do. one more thing thats really stupid is if have your digimon crap anywere but the toilet, it will effect the way it digivoles, so you might get a numemon. I tried so many times to get agumon to digivolve to greymon, but it hopeless. I did everything the walkthroughs told me to do, keep it on a rutien every day, feed it right, and even had it at 30 pounds. It was still hopless. The goul of the game is to bring curupted digimon back to the city. My suggestion to you is to think twice before you by this game."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!,"This is a scam that skirts UK copyright law. Because it's a ""educational documentary"" the ""producers"" pay no royalties as long as the performance clips are very short. If you want to see an old fat bald guy who knows nothing about music or the band reading an old bio and introducing short clips of inferior quality performance footage this DVD is for you. Ask Tommy, Arturo, or Monte, they were tricked into doing this interview."
3,poetic city,"Tibet and its capital, Lhasa, are among the many places I hardly know. This book is a brief introduction to their history, and the competing narratives non-Tibetans have adopted for interpreting Tibet. It is also a work for those enthralled by the question of what was- staring at a modern city block, you wonder: what was here before? The office building that used to be a park where families would picnic on weekends, the suburb that used to be a swamp.The book is incomplete- it doesn't try to present modern Tibetans and their narratives. Perhaps because that identity has become confused by assimilation or maybe the author just didn't understand them and knew it.That said, it's still worth reading as an ode to an ancient city."
2,Not like othere Surfire lights,"Super bright like a car's high-beam, but it won't last long. Doesn't dim before it dies, like other flashlights. It'll just be dead the next time you pick it up. Batteries get very hot too. If all you do is flash quickly with this light, it will hold out for a while. But, if you use it to follow the dog at night, then it will do that for about 3-5 nights. When I bought this light I figured it was cheaper because of the plastic body. No, that doesn't seem to be the only reason why. The more expensive handheld and weapon-mounted models will run much much longer."
5,"Surefire G2 - affordable, strong, like a spot light in your pocket",I picked one of these up recently and am very pleased with it. No one can believe how bright it is. I was able to try out several lights when I got this one and no other could compare. The more expensive streamlight scorpion cost more and was noticably dimmer and the beam was not at all full like this Surefire G2. I plan to keep this one in my pocket and buy a surefire C3 next for the house. This light is excellent for the money - you won't be disappointed.
1,Absolute Rubbish,"If you want to be ripped off then this is the DVD for you. Obviously just another scam from some hack company trying to make some money on the poker craze. If you want to really learn how to beat the pro's then you have to get Annie Duke's How to Beat the Big Boys. The Hellmuth and Lederer DVD's are good too. Also, if you can stomach watching Phil Gordon, his DVD is okay...but that guy is hard for me to take."
2,Traveling With Your Pet,"The book from 2006 is out of date. Do not know how to get the newer edition from 2011. Do not buy if you are offered anotheredition. We found that Drury and Homewood Suites were very open to dogs, but many had to be called and asked. Also, Sheratonand Marriot Residence were open with a heft fee."
3,Find the Black Box Recorder,"You've heard of mood music? The Facts of Life is mood music with a nasty little secret. Every track is a potential conspiracy theory, every little sweetly vicious turn of phrase by Sarah Nixey a dreamscape of uncertainty, a generous slice of middle ground between the the strangely familiar and the easily contemptible. When Nixey sings ""Weekend"" you start to suspect creepy crawly minions under the dustcloths and throw rugs of your most deeply private sectors. This is a sucker punch of a record that knocks you off your feet and doesnt let you up until you've reevaluated everything about every relationship you've ever had."
4,Loved it!!! ;),"I'll just say that if you enjoyed the first two books of the Seabrook Trilogy, you will love this book. This book is a combination of the first two. The intrigue of ""The Notorious Widow"" with the romance of ""The Rake and the Wallflower""."
2,talking teddie book,"The book I purchased was good as far as its appearance, but the whole idea of the book was it talking. When I received it I tried it and found that the batteries were starting to corrode. I swithched them out for new ones, and found out that didn't help either. So the reason I wanted the book for my grandkids was to talk. I did not receive that."
4,Beautiful Album,"I already knew it sounded great from the cd, and got this copy for my boyfriend so we could get a better look at the art. It was beautiful and I'm glad I bought it, but for being ""new"" (from one of the sellers Amazon I guess works as middleman for?) it had dinged up corners and a big scrape on the vinyl itself. Party foul."
2,Disappointed,I bought this for my husband after we used up the last of the chestnut honey I brought back from Italy. This is not the same and the flavor isn't as good. This is not worth the high price.
4,A DECENT Resident Evil clone,Well You start in a hotel. A fire breaks out and people turn into vampires. You take the role of Keith Snyder. You have to resue humans and find a cure for the vampires. It was an ok game. There are puzzles and action to keep you hooked. You find mysterious characters. Though the weapon sounds are dull you have alot of guns to pick from. The sound is alright. The laugh of the vampire is very cheap and corny. The game play is exactly the same as resident evil. I hope the review helped. E-mail me at .... for questions and tips or stragety.
1,A Poor Resident Evil copy.,"This is a lame version of Resident Evil! The graphics aren't nearly as good, it's harder to control and it's not even as scary and fun as R.E. I can see it being billed as a classic to a game (like Doom is to Quake), but I was lead to believe that this was a top notch game. I feel duped. Don't waste your money with this game until it goes in the bargain bin."
2,a wrong clone of resident evil.,"the game is difinetly bad its like you are playing a game in 1995 it has a bad graphics,and dont expect its a scary game cause it has a lot of funny music not like resident evil,but it has a good CG movies so if you like this kind of game buy it."
2,"Nice story gimmick, poor story plot.","A good deal of this relatively short book held my interest for the scenery and mood presented by the author. When looking at a couple of his other books, I see that presenting a realistic atmosphere of World War II Europe is this writer's gimmick. He is quite good at it, and there are certainly worse schemes in vogue by various popular writers.I rate this book low, but not because it is so slow moving. I have enjoyed other books with a deliberate pace. My problem with the book is that the plot is not presented until about half way through the book. Even then, the climax registered as barely a ripple in the water. When I finished the book, I wondered where was the rest, and what was the point of telling the story. I understand from other reviewers that the writer has a sequel to possibly complete the story. The book would have been better if the two volumes had been combined. I doubt that I will invest in the second book."
5,Video worth going to college,"Not exactly the most scientific, but the film definitely shows an artistic and humorous side to the practice. Worth showing a science class for enjoyment and allows for the ability to create environmental questions and concerns."
4,"Funny, informative, and ridiculous","I saw this on T.V. a few weeks ago really late at night. I really just wanna go to Australia with my pellet gun and waste these things after watching this. I'm not gonna go into detail and spoil the funny parts, but it's definitely worth the hour or so it takes to watch. Also through some research I've found that Cane Toads- An Unnatural History is completely factual despite its humor."
1,A biologist's vision of man,"Frans de Waal looks at humans the way he looks at chimps.It is customary to use animals as metaphores for humans. This never does justice to the animals nor to the humans, but a field biologist like Frans De Waal, who works in a zoo, is conditioned to look at animals in their own right. In this book, Frans De Waal avoids the moralism and shows us the great apes in their own right.Frans De Waal succeeds in describing the fascinating societies of two of the three chimp species, Chimpansees and Bonobos, in a very lucid style. De Waal compares their society and politics to our own, the third ape species. Without becoming moralistic, Frans De Waal shows that humans are neither as violent as the chimpansees, nor as maternalistic and promiscuous as the bonobos. But deep down, we do share a lot of characteristics with both species."
2,Political Tract,"I agree with Vladamir: ""Also troubling was De Waal's misdirected swipe at Dawkins' ""Selfish Gene"". Dawkins did go to some extent to distinguish the difference between individual selfishness and what he meant by the phrase `selfish gene'.I would also add that to suggest that Dawkins wrote his book to support the views of Thatcher and Reagen is preposterous.Current evolutionary theory is Neo-Darwinian, not Darwinian. I would generally expect a leading primatologist to know this.I was hoping for a biological theme to this book, not a political one"
4,The most high our standard,This is inspiring details of the in depth understanding of the Lord's prayer. i believe the content of the sermon on the mountain is enbeded in this prayer
2,"Dumb, dumb, and oh yes, more dumb.","Laid to Rest (Robert Hall, 2009)If you haven't had enough of Jason Voorhees through the twelve (at the moment) Friday the 13th flicks, let me introduce you to Chrome Skull (Nick Principe, who also played the monster guy in Death Row and Sands of Oblivion, both of which I've reviewed previously), who wears a skull mask made of chrome and goes around killing people. If you need to know anything more about this flick, go watch a random Friday the 13th movie; there is nothing whatsoever original about what's on the screen here. Still, it's watchable if you've got nothing better around, and it's amusing in a clunky sort of way (it's certainly better than the majority of the Friday the 13th movies), so despite being wholly derivative, I can't be too hard on it. It did try, at least. *"
5,By The Power Of Chromeskull!...,"Simply put, LAID TO REST is one of the best splatter films I've ever seen. Is it goofy in spots? Yes. Do the dialogue and plot bog down in places? Certainly. However, the main reason for a movie like this is to shock w/ insane gore effects, which LTR has in blood-soaked spades! I love this movie for the same reason I love 100 TEARS. Both films are utterly berserk and mean spirited, yet keep me watching in spite of my better judgement! If you are a gorehundt, or wet-work enthusiast, you can't go wrong w/ this gooshy treat! If you are easily offended or sickened, look elsewhere! Long live Chromeskull..."
3,Buyer Beware,"This is a product review, not an author review. Love Max Lucado, but the publishers produced a book with extremely small print. There isn't a large print available. I thought that surely the hardcover version of the book would have a normal type size. This was supposed to be a gift for my practically blind mother who has no problem with large print books! Be aware that the book measures approximately 7 1/4"" X 5 1/4"" and the print is ultra small. Since this book is part of the ""Bestseller Collection"", then it is reasonable to assume that all of the other books in the collection are small print as well. If you are sight-challenged then see if you can find an edition with normal-sized print."
4,Makes sense to me,"I always thought there was something wrong with me. Why couldn't I find the ""balance"" between work and family and having a life that would make me happy in all areas? This book put me straight. There's no such thing!But you can do some things to help life work out better, starting by figuring out your tolerance for chaos and then managing the stuff in life that creates chaos. This book is entertaining and designed to be read in short bits. It's loaded with simple (not stupid) exercises, good advice and case histories of other people. Very helpful. Now I recognize ""high chaos"" people a mile off."
4,Forget what you've heard on the radio from Joan,"I heard ""what if God was one of us"" and nearly threw up. Then I randomly caught a glance of her performing live broadcast on TV and absolutely loved her style and the songs. I rushed to buy this. There is real talent here! Mostly bluesy undertones with a Janis Joplin-esque voice and attitude. Some totally weird fun songs, some ballads that help me get through the day, and some absolute spectacular BLUES with ATTITUDE in ""Ladder""."
5,A gift for a friend.,I already have had this cd for 16 years. The friend I gave it to loves joan and this cd.
3,Not the same,Thought Jon Bongiovi could have been more creative in his melodies and songwriting with this compilation.
5,A Great Collection of Songs Inspired by a Great Movie,"This first-rate CD contains songs by Jon Bon Jovi that were inspired by the successful movie ""Young Guns II"". Each song on the disc has a distinct western style to it, and Jon's fine vocals are apparent on each track. The CD contains such high-energy songs as ""BIlly Get Your Guns"" and ""Never Say Die"" as well as the ballads ""Miracle"", ""Blood Money"", and ""Bang a Drum"". This CD has a distinctly different sound from other Bon Jovi CDs. Gone are the high-energy lead guitar solos. These have been replaced by acoustic guitar pieces and a slower pace to each song. I listen to this CD quite regularly and its one of my favorites in my collection. Pick up this great CD and hear a different side of Jon Bon Jovi."
3,It Goes On and On,"I respect much of this album. I think there are some very good moments. However, something of the essence of Bud Powell is missing. With Bud Powell, there was a focus. On this CD, I sense near misses. Corea records with what I consider to be a very thin piano sound and overbearing drums and I dont find myself reaching for this as much as I had thought I would. I find Corea at his best on his own material which he seems to bring together better."
2,A Mild Walk Through the 100 Acre Woods,"If you're into sitting with your young one when he plays this game, you'll both enjoy it. There's lots to read; the characters don't speak, so if your child hasn't mastered reading, he won't really know the rules of the games he plays.My son and I played it long enough to get far into the 100 Acre Woods, then we turned off the game. It saved where we left off, but when we started the game again, we had to read the prompts when Pooh headed out of his house or we would've lost our saved game, so beware. I showed my six year old how to begin his saved game; if you press the ""new adventure"" selection, you're saved game is history.Overall, I don't like this game because you can lose all that you complete within a click of a button. I didn't find the games too exciting, but my son seems to like them...at least for now."
1,TOO HARD FOR YOUNG CHILDREN-DOESN'T DESERVE ONE STAR,"My 5 year old daughter received this as a gift for her birthday. The game requires A LOT of reading to play. The box says recommended for children 4+ but many children cannot read at this level at that age. I played the game and found it frustrating and my daughter was easily frustrated, and even cried because she couldn't play without my help (with the reading). THis game is way too complex for young children, and it is supposed to be geared towards them."
4,Melba peaches,"Waiting for a CD release of this! It was a grammy nominated album and just wonderful. The title cut is strong with strong vocals. and A cover of Fleetwood mac's ""Dreams"" is a must. ""I cant believe it"" and Livin' for your love are great also."
3,okay,Apparently the quality of the product is not so good when new. The binding is of low quality. I'm told the paperback edition is much better.
3,Recording Quality Sub Par compared to the Dallas Wind Symphony recording,"The interpretation and recording quality is ""collegiate"" compared to the DWS's. This is so in much the same way that the Eastman Merury recordings of the 50's and 60's aren't. They set a new standard for both. That's the best way to put it without too long a dissertation. I don't mean it in a negative way but it sounds a lot like any one of the performances of about ten or fifteen other College Wind Ensembles I can think of.The DWS recording is the must have version if you must choose. It's a standout in recording quality and interpretation.It's for these reasons that you can find so many of Reference's CD's on The Absolute Sound's"" top CD list.Just be careful. It has ruined many high end stereo amps and speakers by guileless owners who underestimate the dynamics that lie within!I have both and glad I have them. I just wouldn't put the Cincinatti first over all others!"
1,misleading info,"misleading info on the product, price quoted for 5 lbs, however when follow the link it is for 1lb bag"
3,Sharp image with few drawbacks,"I used this on a Sony MiniDV PC350Advantages:- The item fits well on the PC350, as expected.- The pouch that comes with the lens is very handy.- Clear image, even after zooming-in all the way. Did not notice any fish-eye like distortions- Light weight. My camera can stay up if I place it on a desk without any other support with lens attached.Disadvantages:- The lens front cap can be lost very easily. Lost it within 20 minutes of first use. Attach the cap to the camera as soon as you receive this item (The cap doesn't snag very well on the lens and the lens sides are very smooth).- Was kind of disappointed with the amount of increase in image size. I thought I'd be able to capture more with this lens. Maybe because this is my first wide angle lens?- Price is a little bit high.Conclusion:Buy it if you have the extra cash. If you are so rich, buy a lens with wider angle (if available) but make sure it is lightweight and provides sharp image."
5,great product.,"It works as specified on my Sony HDR-HC3 HD camcorder. I have used it several times and cant find any noticeable blurs/distortions using this lens.Its a little pricey, but well worth the money."
4,AWESOME CD for smooth jazz lovers!!!,This CD is an excellent mix of brazilian and smooth jazz. I'm not a brazilian jazz person per se but the way he has put this together you don't really want to call it Braziian it's this hypnotic mix that makes EVERY TRACK worth savoring. Anita
3,Welcome return for Springield,"Nice ""comeback"" from a veteran songwriter. The production is a bit overpowering and a few of the songs are a bit thin, but the final track (""Lust"") is the best rocker that Rick has turned in since 'Working Class Dog'. Well worth the price of admission."
5,Cheap and great,My daughter read this book at school and was telling me about it. I told her there was a movie out from that book. She had a fit and wanted me to order it for her class. TheyLOVED THE MOVIE. and it only cost 5.00
2,Indian on the shelf.,"This is a charming movie with nice special effects, a heartwarming story, and plenty of drama and conflict to keep it interesting for adults and children alike... once.We bought this movie for our kids and they have watched it maybe one or two times. It is a bit long and drags towards the end, making it less than ideal as a ""frequent favorite"", at least in our home.If your kids enjoy cowboys, Indians, or magical fantasy (not the Harry Potter kind, but more along the lines of Neverending Story or Labyrinth), they may get a kick out of it. But I'd be lying if I said this movie was worth the purchase price... it's probably best off as a rental."
3,Indian falls short of the garbage,"This movie is really boring, but it is a good movie overall. It is a family movie, nothing more. If you want to go to sleep by yourself watch this movie. Omri is the stupidist name that I've ever heard. He is stupid and listens to his retarded friend. The acting is pretty bad, but despite these many flaws the movie is good to watch once every year or so."
1,DON'T by it,"the ""indian & the cupboard"" is not a good moviebecouse ther is BAD WOORDS in the moviean' it's not that fun to watch(DONT by it)"
2,"Plastic not Hardwood, weak magnet",Magnet not strong enough. knives fall off. Also came in black plastic vs. the natural hardwood as advertised. I sent it back.
1,Awful,"All I can say is that guy not below me but below him sums up this DVD perfectly, could'nt have put it better myself.Oh and by the way, don't buy this DVD its awful, Pearl Jam sold out after their Yield and Live On Two Legs album. Every thing up till then is really good or mostly good.Pearl Jam 1991 - 1998."
3,Lionel Showroom Layouts,"Video quality could be better. Need to see more accessories working rather than talking and trains going around. Still, well worth the childhood memories."
1,"T, A, And an Absence of Acting","Angeline Jolie shows all her assets in this HBO crapfest...and after her clothes hit the floor, she's got nothing left. Monkey lips tries to portray a model, but ends up looking like a stripper throughout most, and can't ennunciate to save her idiotic life. Can you say, ""Thanks, Dad""?"
2,All about Angelina - no Gia in sight,"This film was a great vehicle for Angelina Jolie. Unfortunately it only bears a passing resemblance to the life story of Gia Carangi. If you're interested in Angelina's boobs buy this film. If you're interested in Gia Carangi, buy the book Thing of Beauty by Stephen Fried."
5,touching it made me feel her pain,The movie was very touching. I felt her pain.Angie played her to a T
3,the real Gia was not portrayed well,"Anjolina Jolie did a wonderful job with this role however the writers took a lot of liberties with Gia's life. Everyone makes her mom seem like the bad guy but Gia's issues ran deeper than the lack of her mother's love like the writers want the public to believe. Gia was most likely bipolar which little was done for or known about in the 80's. Gia was a truly beautiful woman but I would wager that she thought and felt as though she were a man. Today we have a label for what I think she was and that is Transgendered. If she were born in the 80's, she would most likely be alive today with medication and a better understanding of who she really is."
5,Wake UP,"I wish people would stop blinding themselves with Angelina Jolies looks and start seeing what an incredible actress she is. The way she portrayed Gia is absolutely fantastic. Hat off to her for throwing herself into this with heart and soul. If anyone one thinks this is not a soul destroying part to play, think again. If it was me, I would have been burnt out by the end of this. Wake up people and see the actress at work and not her beauty."
3,just ok,"the story is fairly predictable: local girl gets discovered, local girl goes to new york and gets swept up with life in the fast lane, local girl loses sight of who she is or was, local girl goes into visible slide and pays the ultimate price.the only thing that redeems this film (slightly anyway) is the uniqueness of the main character's personality -- at once innocent and cold. also, angelie jolie is a terrific actress but her face a little too imperfect and her body a little too boxy to be taken seriously as a stick-figured model."
3,"Delivered what I bought it for, but not much else","""Gia"" is a 1998 film about the rise and fall of a super model. So why would any man want to see this movie? Angelina Jolie. The film is tedious, runs over 2 hours, and most of the world by now knows what drug addiction ends up doing to those unable to rehabilitate. The film delves into same gender orientation lifestyles, but not as erotically as you might expect. The photo session for the model ""GIa"" that Angelina Jolie portrayed that made this DVD worth buying, involves a chain link fence (most of which made me wonder about a stunt double). Pretty much the rest of the movie merits the fast forward button. Not a cable TV view, unless you have premium channels (i.e. HBO). This unrated version here on Amazon has more flesh-fest and girl-girl interest than the R-rated version. You might want to look it up on the Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB) for more info. Faye Dunaway also stars, filmed in Los Angeles and New York."
3,Kappus Avocado Oil Soap,"While OK and with an unusual scent, this soap falls far short of replacing the nice, mild scented avocado soap previously available from Crabtree & Evelyn."
2,By far the worst Death Cab for Cutie album,"This album is the worst DCFC album, why......... Ill tell you why its boring, its repetitive, its way to mellow and im all for mellow but this is ridculous. I mean this is the type of mellow that puts people to sleep, especially the last track. OH MY GOD!!! THAT SONG IS SOOOOO BORING, its called Stability and it will put you to sleep. I am a fan of DFCF and i loved their other albums WE HAVE THE FACTS, PLANS, etc..... but honestly this album did not click with me. i tried listing to the songs again to see if i would probably grow accustome to it, but no that didnt work. Sure this album has its moments, but trust me when i say your not missing out on anything. I would not buy the album, instead buy the 2 stand out songs off itunes or napster; A MOVIE SCRIPT ENDING and WE LAUGH INDOORS. The only 2 stand out tracks."
4,Coney Island,"If you're going to get any of Death Cab's albums, get this one. Great melodies, great vocals, and honest, unpretentious lyrics. What more could you ask for? Coney Island is the best of the album, I just wish it were longer."
1,why take advice from a professional whore?,"What a pity every woman whose ""husbands"" she has boldly serviced did not read this before they devoted their lives to the sort of man who have sought and yes BOUGHT her services. yeah,crying on her pillow , needing cuddles blah blah. Who is she trying to fool?If her story is to be believed , she sure does not live in the real world .Most women I know who are wives and mothers are far too busy trying hard to be great human beings- they sure are not spending their time scuba diving, being (or pretending to be) pilots , going to beauty salons, spa's etc. Get real Veronica.Did your conscience every bother you? ----I call this book a classic example of woman's inhumanity to Woman."
2,Redundant,"The little I read about it, I thought she keeps on repeating herself on different chapters. I think it could have been better edited to cut out the repetitions of the same information. Because I knew some of what she was talking about I did not get much out of it, but I did get ONE good insight (one sentence) that was helpful. I also found that she is not very straight to the point. On one of the chapters I read, she talks, talks, talks and never got the any useful info. I kept on expecting that she would expose one of her ""secrets,"" and instead she was bragging about the millionaires she met in her career. I think she can rewrite it and make it a better version of it, by going straight to the point of what she wants to say, because her experience is valid. The best part I found in the book were the links of helpful websites and organizations about sex education and etc. Overall, I did not find it worth the price."
1,Less than 1 star!,"When I read a book I don't look for any deep psychological meaning. I just want an entertaining story, maybe something that instructs, some history, a substantial plot, perhaps even something to think about after finishing the book. This book is NONE of those things and is so poorly, immaturely written that you struggle to complete the last sentence before putting it in the ""donate"" pile. A badly composed story of a 21st century female who ""falls"" through time into the 1800's, instantly fits into a well-to-do family, wears the clothes of the time period with lust and falls madly in love with a family member inside of 20 minutes. Horrible - story, plot, characters - everything. Ms. Cooney, if not already in high school, needs to go back to class to learn how to write before she perpetrates any more of her crimes on readers. Do not buy - this attempt - or any of her others until she learns a few things."
2,Read This Review Before You Buy This One,"Be careful on this one. If you're die hard, you're gonna love anything they did and the hand-held camcorder thing will work for you and you will forgive the thin sound.If you are looking to understand the Ramones, you would do better picking up the Anthology CD set. They didn't look like this in person and they sure as hell didn't sound like this either.....the real sound was mind numbing, totally engaging, and in your face every second....if you forgot to think for one sec, you were lost. This video let's you quit thinking from the start.....this one would have been better left unreleased.....except that it's about all there is to see them now.....what a shame!"
5,I was an extra in this movie,"I was an extra in this movie. YOu wouldn't believe the work that the film makers put into making a film. Hundreds of actors and exrtas were on hand for the filming of this movie, which happens to be quite good. This movie really marks Julia Roberts return to the big time movie. The movie is funny. I personally would recomend it to Julia Roberts fans. I would also recomend it to fans of light hearted comedies. watch it and fall in love with Julia all over again."
2,Rupert Everett salvages an otherwise dreadful movie,"In his role as Julia Roberts' gay friend George, Rupert Everett effortlessly steals the show--he is urbane and witty, wise and caring, and of course uproariously funny and drop-dead gorgeous. In contrast, ""leading man"" Dermot Mulroney appears crass, callow, and utterly devoid of charm or magnetism. This movie, billed as a comedy, has a element of mystery at its core: Why on earth would two such winners as Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz fight for the affections of such a dolt!"
3,Good romantic comedy!,"MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, in my opinion, is a good romantic comedy! If you ask me, Julia (Roberts), Dermot (Mulroney), and Cameron (Diaz) dazzle! My favorite parts are when Julianne (Julia Roberts) chases after Michael (Dermot Mulroney) as he's chasing after Kimmy (Cameron Diaz) and when Kimmy and Julianne yell at each other in the ladies' room at Comiskey Park. One thing I hate about this movie is Cameron Diaz' singing. My friend covered his ears when she sang ""I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself."" No offense, Cameron, but you sang better in THE MASK. In conclusion, there is a moral to this story, and that is, ""Never take your relationship with your boyfriend or girlfriend for granted."""
4,Very amusing and original....,"Julianne (Julia Roberts) discoveres she's in love with her ex boyfriend and now best friend, Michael, just when he is about to marry Kim, a perky young blond. She's determined to break up the wedding and grab Michael for herself. She flies to the wedding on his request, and shcked to be almost forced to be Kim's bridesmaid. But she recovers very quickly and even uses her position to play various dirty tricks just to break the couple up - ranging from making Kim sing Kareokee to sending a letter that might terminate Michael's job and / or trust in Kim's family.... Howdoes this work out? You'll have to see the movie to figure that out...I liked this movie because it managed to remain both original and VERY funny, unlike many other romantic comedies..."
4,My Best Friend's Wedding,"The actors in this film are great BUT if you are looking for a love story with a happy ending this is not it. If I were in the mood for just a story this one is great. I happened to be looking for a happy ending. Yes I know about reality, but I was in the mood to see Julia Roberts get some happiness. What I was looking for was disappointing. Too bad this type of film does not have a WARNING label (just my opinion). This one goes in the same catagory as Casablanca (Humphrey Bogart) and Roman Holiday (Audrey Hepburn).Excellent talent and scenery. Just not my idea of a love story."
2,Overrated,"I found this movie to be quite overrated. This was yet another movie billed as a comedy but that produced very few laughs. The thin plot grew tiresome quickly. The best part of the movie is the sing-along and the music. It's not that it's a ""bad"" movie, it's just not immensely entertaining. I'd buy the soundtrack before I bought the movie. It's odd because Julia Roberts typically makes much better choices. Go with Mystic Pizza, Runaway Bride, or Notting Hill instead."
5,Very Funny and Entertaining,I really like this movie because it had a great plot and great main character. I also liked how great of friends Micheal and Jules were. And how George was so supportive and nice even though he was gay. This is a great movie for anyone to see!!
2,What Stupid Movies are Made of..,Oh my she's almost 30 and doesnt' have a man. She had better get one any way she can even if she doesn't love him. Kimmy must give up her college dreams and do everything her husband wants. Says a lot about women doesn't it? Don't waste your time on this one.
5,I just loved this movie!,"This is one of my favorite movies.I've watched it over and over again 'coz I was captivated by the story and cast. I really loved this flick,it's really hilarious,and cute! Julia looks great in the movie,and she truly did a good job.This is the kind of movie that makes you laugh and gets you thinking what you really want,and who you are.Go watch it!"
1,do not spent you money for this one,"this movie is not just boring, but annoyed me. Is it only me that think Jlia Roberts was a nasty and stupid woman in this movie?"
4,Charmed Season 5,"I am a Charmed fan but this season wasn't as good as I expected. Don't get me wrong, I am still recommending this season but not all of the episodes were up to par. I did particularly like the episode that Brian Krause (Leo) assisted in writing. Overall, I think I would give this season a 4 on a 1-5 scale. I am looking forward to next season and the addition of Chris."
5,Love it!!!,Love the whole series...am very satisfied and recommend to everyone to get this series as well as the other seasons
4,How charming!,"This season of Charmed was really good, but I didn't like it as much a the first four. Some of the story lines were just way out there, even for this show. Also, I wish it had focused on familyand sisterhood more than it did. Besides that, it was great!"
5,AWESOME!!,i really loved this item. it plays really well. it came in really good time. theres not really any tears or anything that would effect the case or the cd's.
3,"Only if you're a committed fan, otherwise look for something else","I've got seasons 1-4 on DVD already, but am hesitant to buy this one. The mix of the first 3 seasons with Prue making up the original 3 charmed ones still on it were the best to me, season 4... ok, out of curiosity to remember all about Paige's arrival.It's been a bit below that level since the days of Cole's departure & kind of lingering without a lot of clear direction or focus. I used to have to watch Charmed every week for the first few seasons, now I don't really care if I miss it & it's a struggle to sit through an episode without getting distracted.Curious that this DVD set doesn't get released until June in the US, here in NZ this set has been available in the stores since late March, and I saw season 6 appear on the shelves last week too."
5,hijole!!!,Tito puente is the numero uno chingon of Latin jazz. I can play this CD over and over and still Bob my head. Like the first time I put this bad boy on.
1,Uggh,"Trying to understand the multiple stars this book received by others.An ungrateful son berates an immigrant father and in spite of his self-hating persona perseveres to become a physician. All ego, and lacking compassion, this is not my type of writer or physician."
3,Not bad.,"Good low card protein bar...only buy when on sale. There are other better tasting bars out there, which cost less and are lower carb. Check your local 'club' bulk sales locations for additional options."
5,My Dogs Love This!,"My dogs usually eat their food reluctantly. After trying a variety of different canned foods, I came across this. My dogs LOVE it! My cats love it, too!"
3,Dog likes the taste - Really Dry,"My dog likes the taste of the food, but it's really dry. If you mix wet food with dry food, then this is not the canned dog food for you. It's really cumbersome to mix. It breaks up and doesn't coat the other dry food. Because of that, it takes more than other wet dog dog food to actually coat the dry dog food. However, my dog did really like it, and she had no allergy issues with it. I won't buy again because it doesn't work well for how I feed my pup."
2,Ok at first,She liked it at the beginning and then started leaving food in the bowl. I switched to chicken and she liked much better.
3,Kate has mellowed,"My favorite musical artists have put out new discs and much to my surprise, I like them both! Ms. Kate Bush's ""Aerial"" by night and Deep Purple's ""Rapture of the Deep"" by day! Kate settles me down after a hard day's work, then tucks me into bed. While Deep Purple's immense and clever brand of rock gets me through those long commutes. These two powerful albums need to be played a few times in order to reap the full benefits. Both are strong statements that evoke a powerful and different kind of energy, a musical ying and yang.Talk about the state of the ""ART!""Welcome back Kate! Bravo DP!Aerial = 3 1/2 starsRapture of the Deep = 5 stars"
5,A Journey,"I just recently started listening to Kate Bush, and I have to say that Aerial is a great album! To me, the progression of the album takes me on a journey. Each track has a unique sound and very meaningful lyrics. Some of my favorite tracks are King of the Mountain, How to Be Invisible, and An Architect's Dream. Make sure you give her music a listen. It is well worth it!"
5,Kate is a goddess!,"No one says it like Kate! When I'm in that special Kate-y mood, I just pop on the headphones, pour myself a stiffy and get going to the intersectioin of Kate and Bush!"
3,It's been tooo long of a wait.................,I gave this album 3 stars just for her return from obscurity..... but an artist of Kates genious shouldn't have stayed gone more than a decade...no matter how deserving her break was. It is apparent in her vocals....something was lost and she has obviously retreated to a safe zone with her singing.There is no excitement found here.....just the poetry of a middle aged woman fading into her twilight years. I cannot say the wait was worth it.
4,The highly anticipated return,"This collection was somethings that KB's fans were waiting for since the release of the red shoes'93. As a fan I was anxious and happy to finally get the new record. I think it is very good and very profound in its meaning, but different from what I expected. If your favorite albums were the sensual world and the red shoes this one is the closest one in climate. This is the mellow Kate I enjoy. My personal favorite was the dreaming and hounds of love, so the sound is quite different. If you are not familiar with KB's music, get the whole story first. She is not your typical pop star, it takes a special connection not everyone is priveledged with I guess to understand her art. If she added some 'wilder' side of her to this record it would've been a 5."
4,Aerial Soars,"Kate Bush returns after a twelve-year absence with a double album, Aerial. Perhaps spurred on by the Futureheads who covered her great ""Hounds Of Love"", Aerial fits right in with her classic sound. Rich, lush soundscapes enriched by Ms. Bush's distinctive voice dominate the disks. Disk one, titled A Sea of Honey is personal and first-person in its themes dealing with subjects like the death of her mother and starting a family and dealing with domestic issues like a washing machine and she also dabbles with mathematical theories. Disk two, A Sky of Honey is a conceptual piece that thematically follows a day's progression from afternoon to dusk to nighttime and finally the next day's sunrise. Disk one is more commercial and has a more immediate sound, but disk two is the more rewarding piece. As with most double albums, there is a clunker here and there, but it is most welcomed to have Ms. Bush back and releasing music after too long of an absence."
4,Good,My dog is 16 and 1/2 years old so pee pads are a much needed item. Natures Miracle is the best brand. If you don't mind spending a few more $ the extra adsorbing (all white) pads work even better than these.
5,"Great for EDC, I wear in OTB and Inside Waistband with add on loops","Great Leather, Looks and functions great, snap secured wpn, tight profile, sturdy construction. Good for CC and EDC, I wouldnt use it for competition as its not as easy to re holster quickly as a kydex holster is.Fits my HK USP 40 compact as promised.Bonus! It also fits my full size BarettaPX4 9mm as well as Glock 26,27,33 like it was made for them. I dont know why but I sure am happy about it.Versatile and with a little inginuity can be worn open carry, CC Inside Waist (add IWB loops to belt slots), and CC On the Belt."
3,"What is the Kindle definition of ""Table of Contents""?","I get books that say they have 'active table of contents' or the MOBI that also say that, but either the TOC is not even a choice in the menu, or if available to choose, it just goes to the beginning of the book. Very misleading."
1,Cheap cheap cheap,These are very cheaply made lamps all lose and wobbly the lamp shades were destroyed when it arrived when I contacted the shipper they sent out a table top to replace lamp shades . That was over a month ago and now they won't respond to my emails so I guess I'm stuck with this cheap (damaged) Chinese crap. I would not recommended this company to my worst enemy
5,"Cute, super-comfy. The perfect everyday shoe.","I struggled over which sneakers to get to replace my over-5-years-old ones that were falling apart. I am allowed to wear sneakers to work but wanted them to look decent and not get dirty easily. These shoes are the perfect choice, and the comfort is outstanding. I look forward to buying more Jazz sneakers in different color schemes - some of them are really fun and springy, while I might get some dark red ones next fall. Love."
3,Earlier Reacher Books Better,"Yes, Reacher is violent, superhuman even, but he's so cool. I like the way he can fight against huge steriod pumped guys and come up the winner. The book starts out with a bang and does slow down later, but I like the way Reacher works; with both the good guys and the bad guys. There are times when he seems to have a concious, he hesitates to kill someone who is a threat to him because he knows this person is trying to protect someone else. The earlier Reacher novels don't seem to have the callouseness that this novel has. I will still continue to read this series, but hopefully the next one is better. I guess every writer has an off book."
5,I had trouble pausing this book,"Reading this book on my Kindle, I was having trouble pausing and getting on with life.Of the Reacher books I have read so far (1 thru 7), I find this one the best and most addictive. The worst was the previous No. 6 book, and I have posted a separate review of that one. The low rating for that one was possibly due to the fact that it was about politics, and that usually leaves me cold.The book has a well developed suspense and action theme. There are also a few surprises, which is always good.So, 5 out of 5 stars with this one."
3,A fun read,"Lee Child's hero, Jack Reacher, is the literary equivalent of Grand Theft Auto. All that is missing is the noise and video. Child makes up for the gory visuals in extensive detail and an exciting plot set outside of Portland, Maine. One crucial fight has its own chromatic punch and it goes on for three pages, punch for punch, sally for sally, feints and all interspersed with Reacher's strategizing on how to stay alive. The plot is flawed by weightiness; confusing in part as Child tries to coherently run two plots along to the climax. It does not work effectively. But, Reacher - thank, our literary stars - goes off to Miami at the end to reappear who knows where."
2,Too much of Reacher the cold stone killer,"I have enjoyed several in the series, but in a couple of the books, this one and Killing Floor, Reacher is too much of a conscience free killer for my tastes. Shoot 'em when they're not looking, dispose of the body, and move on to the next guy. Hey, they had it coming. In the better ones in the series a bit more of Reacher's human side is developed, and the bad guys fall when they are gunning for Reacher or his friends. A bit more heroic that way."
2,Disappointing,"Not up to Lee Child standards. This one has a very thin plot, and has too much willy-nilly violence."
4,Persuader- Another good Jack Reacher Novel!,"I like all of the Jack Reacher books, so I am a little prejudice, but this is another one worth reading (or listeneing to). As always Jack pulls off miracles in doing good for society. If you like the series, you will like this book."
1,poor persuader,First of all why would two federal agents have a cillvillan investagate their friends disapearence if they really cared about their they would go undercover themselves that would be a much more interesting novel like two soliders going behind enemy lines to rescue their buddy that would be a great novel AMAZON.COM if you can tell Lee Child this don`t write any more Jack Reacher books they all are stupid stupid stupid.
2,Persuader,WorstReacher novel I've read! Too Far Fetched!!!! Impossible to kill that many people and create those circumstances! Definetely would not recommend.
5,Persuaded review,Interesting read very compelling. Love the characters. Didn't want it to end. Kept searching for the next page wanting more.
4,Reacher #7,"Good continuation of the Reacher series....although I keep asking myself how someone who just wants to be left alone continually gets invoved in these capres..but then, there wouldn't be a series if he didn't, would there?"
2,not up to par,"I have enjoyed all of his books so far except this one, I have to agree with those who have panned it. Too confusing, too much unnecessary detail. I find myself skipping pages of filler that adds nothing to the story. So far my fav was Tripwire - this one doesn't even come close. Hope the rest are better."
3,sub par jack reacher,"I read all of the Jack Reacher books and loved all of them, til now. I think the book is good but now that I have to picture Jack in the body of Tom Cruise, the books lose credibility. There's no way little tiny Tom Cruise would stand a chance in a fight with the giant gatehouse guard in Persuader. The mental image of this makes the book much less credible. I'm not sure what Lee Child was going for when he cast the physical ""polar opposite"" of Jack Reacher when there are so many actors who would be a better fit. My image of Jack Reacher is the actor who played Denny Duquette on Grey's anatomy; his name is Jeffrey Dean Morgan or something like that. Big, good looking, muscular. Not teeney tiney Tom."
4,An exciting book,"This is my first Jack Reacher book, and it lives up to everything I've been told about this character. If you like men who don't hesitate to follow up on their suspicions, no matter what the odds, make sure you read about Jack Reacher."
5,Another great Reacher novel,"Lee Child has produced another great Reacher novel. I finished it quickly and as usual, I immediately downloaded the next one!"
4,I haven't found a Reacher I haven't liked!,"Some are a little less believable than others, but this Jack Reacher novel was the most believable yet. I really enjoyed the theme and the visualization. I felt I was right there in the room, car, ocean, whatever! Well done. On to the next now!"
5,BEAUTIFUL music,"This is the best CD of lullabies of this genre that I've found. The songs are beautiful, soothing, and reflective without being sappy. The guitar accompaniment to the male and female vocalists (one male and one female alternate singing the songs, i.e. female voice on #1, #2, #3, male voice on #4, #5, etc.) creates a warm, relaxed setting.I play this every night for my girls while they fall asleep (my Mother kept the ""girl version"" to play when the grandkids visit, and gave us the ""boy version""; but the kids don't notice the one song this affects, and I like the ""boy version"" words anyway!) I intend to give one to a friend with a new baby - it is VERY good!"
5,Super!,Thanks to the folks at Rhino for putting out superior products. All my favorites look and sound great here.What a wonderful companion to the CD series. I love this DVD. I can only hope that Rhino puts out more volumes of this series. Volumes 1 and 2 are just not enough.
3,"Great watch, but........",This is a beautiful watch with a great feel. I have the white faced version. I love the style and get many compliments. But about a month after I got it I noticed the the split timer hand (black hand) was no longer resetting to zero. I have done several manual adjustment to realign the hands but every time I use the stop watch feature it no longer resets to zero. Very frustrating. I expected more from Accutron and from a watch in this price range.
2,Already Heard It!!!,This cd from start to finish is nothing more than tracks he put on mixtapes.I was hoping for an all out cd with maybe two or three songs from his mixtapes..but nope i was wrong...now if you havent heard any of his mixtapes then i highly recommend getting this cd...but if you're a hard core dipset fan who gets all there mixtapes..and is on limewire looking for new songs by them ...then dont get this cd ...its a waste of your money..hopefully hell put something out with some new tracks..and I wont have to hear the same written freestyles i hear from him all the time..like your car will blow up as soon as your key hits the ignition its a knife ta ya kneck as soon as i see you in the prison...im connected everywhere im respected everywhere brooklyns a diease you tryin 2 spread it everywhere
1,quite disappointed,"My wife wanted to watch this...now I know why. The name of the movie pretty much gives away the plot so very little needs to be said about it. Wife (Diane Lane) is bored and cheats on hubby (Richard Gere) with some young french guy that you can barely understand. Nuff said.I found this to be incredibly slow. Most of the scenes are way to long and soporific at best. The characters have next to no chemistry and there is very little about them that will cause you to be even slightly interested in them or what they are going through. ""Fans"" of Diane Lane may find something to entertain them but that is about all I can think of in regards to this movie."
1,Show and Tell,"This movie is about 1 centimeter from being X rated. With a good story, plot line, acting, you don't need to go to the extreem with the sex stuff. As I was looking around the theater, I noticed others as uncomfortable as I, and a mad rush to the door as soon as it was over. Many individuals were squirming in their seets, and not from a rush of hormones. They, like myself, were uncomfortable!"
3,Not fan of the story line,The movie was good overall but I was not a fan of the story of the wife cheating on her husband.
2,Unfaiithful,"I am disappointed that Diane Lane would make such a movie. The sex scenes were unsettling. There was no tenderness. It was like watching an assault. I would be ashamed to have this on my shelf, so I put it where it belongs--in the garbage."
2,And she was unfaithful why?,"While this wasn't a horrible movie, it certainly wasn't great. It seemed that the writers didn't spend enough time at the beginning of the movie establishing a relationship between the wife and the lover to make me believe that this reasonably happy woman would go flitting off to the city every day to have a raunchy affair. The fact that her illicit lover was french just seemed like one more cliche, though at least the writers had the good grace not to make him an artist.Unlike the other reviewers, I thought the second half of the movie was rather better than the first, because the interaction between Diane Lane and Richard Gere, with both of them lying but about different things, was rather good."
2,A Predictable Pleasure,"This is by no means a 5 star movie. I'd actually give it 2.5 stars, if it were possible. Right from the start you basically can see how it's all going to end. I felt as though the director tried to cover up the weak predictable script by making every scene overly-dramtic with pounding music and flashy camera moves. The acting however, made up for the predictable story.Diane Lane is by far the best thing about this movie. She did give a great performance, as a selfish immature mother, although it is not Oscar worthy. The other characters were cliched, and the French guy with whom Diane's character has the affair, is downright annoying.All in all, this is a slightly entertaining movie worth watching when you have nothing better to watch."
2,BORING!!!,"This movie wasn't anything close to Adrian Lyne's previous success ""Fatal Attraction"". Although the story was along the same lines, it just wasn't as intense and scary as ""Fatal Attraction"". It was very long, quiet, and downright boring. You will enjoy ""Fatal Attraction"" much better than this."
2,No big deal.,"I saw the movie last week, and I thought it was nothing special. Another bored housewife cheats on her husband and it never turns out well... Diane Lane was very good with Olivier, but the movie just got freaky and disjointed. Gere's role as MILK SOP took over the end and it just left me blah. A long way to go to no where."
1,3 things I learned from this movie,"I learned three things from watching this movie: It's alright to force women to have sex and ""no"" really does mean ""yes""; If someone sleeps with your wife, it's appropriate to brain them with a snowglobe; and there is no marital problem that cannot be solved by murdering someone. I got this movie because Diane Lane was nominated for an Oscar for it. But I did not see anything she did which any porn actress cannot do (fake exstacy during love-making). I thought Richard Gere was good, but this plot is completely idiotic. First, it gives potential rapists more reason to think it's a good idea to force yourself on a woman. Then it ends with the theory that infidelity and murder just make your relationship stronger. The idea that any relationship could survive what occurs in this film is completely implausable. Maybe Adrian Lynne has never witnessed any relationships outside of porn."
4,4 1/2 stars,"This sequel to ""Theodora's Diary"" is still saturated with dry British humor, but with a major change in cast. The loss of two major characters is not quite made up for by the colorful new Vicar, but the new character is vibrant, unexpected and perfect for the atmosphere of the story.The main character Theodora seems to have become less shallow in this book, delving into deeper questions and more inner searching. It makes for a more emotional read than the first book.Despite the differences when compared to the first book, this is still highly entertaining and a rollicking good read. Many of my friends who didn't really like the first book enjoyed this one very much."
3,"Good ""first book"" on the Registry","For the most part, this is clone of his ""Windows 95 Registry troubleshooting"" book with some added information on remote registry editing and a few NT specific tips. That was very disappointing.On it's own, however, it's a good first book for anyone who doesn't own any books on the Registry. Like the other books on this subject, it covers using RegEdit and RegEdt32 and gives you a pretty good overview of the registry. But, it lacks any kind of comprehensive list of registry settings, even on the CD. I also found the CD was missing a couple of files listed in the back of the book. While it also does a pretty good job of covering policies and some network settings, this isn't the best book available for network administrators."
2,Not the best war memoir,"Maybe I'm biased; but the best memoirs I have read have been. ""The forgotton soldier"" & ""with the old breed."" I appreciate the rareity of personal account of Marines in WW1, but the book was very vague & written in a non-modern style of writting. The writer isn't very discriptive as far as the battles go. Was expecting a better written book."
3,Horrible!!!! Save your money!!!,"This book was AWFUL compared to teh first! The storyline was both predictable and ludicrous!I am going to spoil the book b/c I really REALLY want you to consider this before you buy it: FOR SOMEONE TO REGRET CHEATING ON HER HUSBAND ONCE (SHE CHEATED ON BRICE IN TEH FIRST BOOK AND NOW CHRISTIAN IN THIS ONE) SHE CERTAINLY DID IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN! GIVE ME A BREAK! SHE CHEATED ON HER HUSBAND AGAIN RIGHT AFTER HE FOUND OUT! AND THEN HE TOOK HER BACK AT THE END. I GUESS LIFE REALLY IS HAPPILY EVER AFTER!And Mia falling for someone who BEAT her tail within an INCH of her life made this book worse!Ugh, this book was pathetic. I was really anxious to read this b/c I surprisingly LIKED The Ties That Bond. In that book, things made more sense. And I'm upset that Ms. Parks allowed Brice cheating w/Mia to cause Kree to stand up for herself. This book was awful and will be going on my half.com inventory list!UGH!!"
5,Los Lonely Boys,"This is a great selection. I also went to see them last weekend at the Sleeptrain Pavillion in Concord CA. They played several of the songs on the CD. It took a couple of play's to grow on me, but now I wake up to the 4th song on the CD everymorning. It is worth buying for sure."
5,great group o' guys,"good music, good harmonies, good lyrics, good values, did i mention good? the radio stations played the heck out of ""heaven"" from their last release, but this one's not getting nearly as much spin. i don't get it ... there are a number of cuts on this one that would warrant the disc boys having another listen. anyway, i'd definitely buy this platter again."
3,Mayne.......,"This dude was one of my friend and I's favorite rappers due to his song Bounce! That was the only good song though, so thats the only song we bumped and the only reason why we liked him. errtime i here this, i think of highschool days drivin around gettin drunk. i say just DL the 2 bounce songs and thats it, that's all thats worth listenin to. 1"
3,Good information,"This book is fairly complete, including not only what I would consider novelty songs but also parodies and one-hit wonders. It includes a discography of songs mentioned and many other bibliographical information. At first it was a slow read for me, but once he started mentioning the history of one-hit wonders I love I was more interested. It could have been more up to date, however, for example I would really be interested in information about the ""Mambo No. 5"" takeoff ""Combo No. 5"" or other '90s parodies."
4,It's Not That Bad!,This product is not nearly as bad as the previouse reviewer indicated. The product in both of my microwaves needs to be heated in the vented bag for 90 seconds not the 60 seconds indicated in the instructions. When I heated it for 60 seconds it was indeed dry. It also needs to be massaged in the bag for at least 30 seconds for the best results. It makes a pretty good side dish and is also very good when mixed with other ingredients like chopped spinich or the vegatable or meat of your choice.
1,Not so good,"These dishes are quick and easy, but the taste if blaned and bitter. I had to add a tablespoon of butter just to make it edible."
5,"The Thing, From Another World! (James Arness)","Although the Kurt Russell film was good,this is the original and best version. It has always been one of my favorite 50's si-fi movies."
4,Bogey-man Classic,Another fine old-time classic. Good storyline. Another nice addition to your films. No over-done cinematography here. Just a plain scary old-time alien movie.
4,The Thing from Another World should be in COLOR,"I bought this DVD from AMAZON.COM last month primarily because it is UN-EDITED. I also have this movie on VHS cassette that was COLORIZED and given STEREO sound. TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES did the work on this about 25 years ago. The picture COLOR and STEREO sound in my opinion really improved the presentation but unfortunately they edited out so much of the movie that parts of it didn't make complete sense. If they could add color and improve the sound quality then, I know that they could do a better job now without REMOVING any of the original scenes. I gave it 4 stars because it's mono and in black & white. I'd give it 5 stars +++++++++++++ if it was re-released in color with enhanced sound!"
3,A fine James Arness debut,"This was the first of the Thing movies and was well done for the time period of the fifties in which it was set. One of the great make-up jobs done on an actor, you must look closely to recognize Jim Arness, in his pre-Marshall Dillon days. The stuff that came after is alright but, this one led the way."
4,Definitely a Sci/Fi Classic,"Hi you all from Melbourne Town, thanks to Amazon I just received the DVD copy of ""The Thing"", we all know the story, I'm simply going to say the the quality is 100% fine very good picture and clear sound, Warner Brothers have done a very good transfer to DVD, many thanks. I am now waiting for films like the ""Bamboo Saucer"" and ""Crack in the World"", and maybe a host of lesser ""B"" grade movies to come to DVD. The scene that always brings a smile is the reading out of the Reference Number ""629-49 item 6700 extract 7500 131...oh, that one"" they just don't make films like this anymore!"
4,Mashall Dillon on a ramage,"This is is first movie and it is a wonderful cross-over movie during the Science Fiction genre to Horror. It is very well done, considering it is totally inaccurate.John Carpenter's The Thing was taken from this movie. When you watch it objectivly you can see he kept the same feeling, but updated it. Plus he jump started Kurt Russell's career.Two thumbs up for you John!"
4,Recipe for successful filmmaking - scary too.,"Take a group of good ol boys from WW11, add a mad scientist (he must be mad wearing a yachting jacket in the Arctic); a wisecracking dame cup size D; isolate them; throw in some snappy dialogue, a rampaging blood sucking monster that doesn't mind the cold, winces a little when set alight, and is a threat to the world as we know it; and top it off with a scene stealing prop - a geiger counter with a flashing light; and you have one hell of a movie. If you willingly suspend disbelief, turn the lights off, and watch it uninterrupted, it will also give you a thrill or three."
3,The House on Beartown Road,Book is well written and interesting. Can get a little dry at parts but really shines a light onto what people really experience with a relative who is deteriorating. I would recommend it to anyone who was going through the same issues as the author.
5,"Welcome to life, and all it brings","What a wonderful book. I have noticed that many who review this book are intimately involved in Alzheimers, be they professional or private care-givers. I don't have anyone in my immediate family with Alzheimers, but I read this as a potential gift to a friend who does. I am grateful that I was motivated to read this lovely, loving account of a disease and the way if effects those who are near it. The author and her family serve as reminders that love comes in all forms, and may be asked of you at the most inconvient moments. Don't wait until you have Alzheimers in your family to read this book. So much gentle learning to be done, so much joy to be given, so many miles we go, travellers through life."
5,You can count on family,"Elizabeth's story is a tribute to anyone who is a member of a family. My own family has not nearly the stress that this unique family threesome confronts together. The ability to find a way to appreciate each other no matter where we are in lifes journey is chronicled with grace and beauty. Thumbs up to Elizabeth Cohen for reminding us that no matter what we accomplish or what stage of life we are in, our family is our beginning and final source of hope."
4,"This Is America, Charlie Brown","This Peanuts Gang series is a great way for elementary age students to learn a lot of great information about American History. Even in the 21st century, the uniqueness of these characters appeals to our youth. Inserting the Peanuts kids into historical situations helped my 5th grade students comprehend, and hopefully, remember more. The script writers did their research homework and the episodes were well done."
5,Interesting book,"Read this book quite some time ago, but it was quite an interesting book, esp the part where he talked about how better quality products can actually become consumer standards if right business strategy is used. Im rather surprised to see so many lousy comments on this book.....this book deserve more credit. Probably those who wrote it are Netscape fans or something.....! Im not a fan of Bill, but whatever it is, since he is the richest guy in this planet he is really something......whether he copied others people's ideas or whatever."
5,This is the best book if you understand bussiness,This is the best book on the thoughts of Bill Gates with many great ideas. I am not a Gates lover but I think people don't think like him a lot of the time so they trash talk him. And they are Gates haters so thats why the book is not getting rated 5 stares right now. I gave it a 5. On of the best birgraphys I've read EVER!!
4,A Fair Book,"I've read the book many times, but about half of the book is boring and 1/4 of the book is advertisement of Microsoft. His visions of the future is fine, but he may be too optimistic. He tells the readers ALL about how Microsoft grew, but I don't think it's really necessary"
4,"Aug 9th reviewer needs to work on grammar, vocabulary","Look at the ""reader from India"" review of Aug 9th. He states that Gates is, ""...the greatesthuman to ever don the earth."" I don't really understand what he's trying to say, but I hope his Oracle and SQL skills are better than his writing skills. And I hope he has a proofreader to check his programming documentation."
1,Microsoft Informercial in Print!,"Bill Gates banters on for about 200 pages about his vision of the future.What Bill doesn't tell you is that 90% of Microsoft's successes come fromacquisition and business savvy, not vision. I would not let Bill Gatesmislead you with this book -- he is a srewd business man, but not a visionary.I'd skip this one."
5,Greatly underrated,"The fact that Trotsky tried to devise a revolutionary strategy to cope with the issues aroused by the existence of a Popular Front government in 1930s France made this collection of short pieces and pamphlets to remain consistently out of fashion for the next 70 years, as Marxists tended more and more to make a fetish out of Liberal Bourgeois political forms. Therefore the relevance of this book, as a discussion of the shortcomings of said Bourgeois Democracy in terms of the overall sclerosis imposed by it on the Body Politic."
3,So funny,"Ha! This book was hilarious! The sex scenes were either written by a man or by a woman who had never had sex before. (I think the author uses a pen name, kind of like I do, because I'm really a woman.) The author actually uses the words ""swollen labia"" in the middle of a sex scene. Heh heh. But this book is definitely worth buying if you want to read a romance novel out loud over the campfire with your friends. You'll have people rolling on the ground."
5,Original,"I borrowed a paperback copy from My Brother in Louisiana some years ago.I couldn't put it down till I was finished.All the charactors were well fleshed out.The Idea of uplift, neochimps and so on a plausible idea for the future.Brin has come up with a solid Universe for his books.In One or two of his later works he gets somewhat obscure in places and the thread is weak, It always picks up and is always entertaining.He cannot write enough or fast enough for me."
1,Bad Bootleg DVD?,"Whoever transferred this movie to DVD should be ashamed of their work. I had never watched a bootleg version of a film before but from the very beginning, it appeared to me that that was exactly what this DVD represents. After 10 minutes of adjusting the sharpness and contrast on my TV and cleaning my TV screen and glasses, I realized that this movie was seriously out of focus . . . and may even have been captured with a handheld video camera judging from the jittery pan-and-scan. It took an aspirin for me to watch this film to the end. I suggest purchasing the newly released Sony version; it is complete, professionally transferred, and eye-strain free."
2,Good things do not always come to tyhose who wait,"I have waited for this film for decades. I understood the quality may not be the best, but the film is excellent. The first copy had to be returned because it was defective. The second copy had to be returned because it was defective. I am now waiting for the third copy; sooner or later one will play without stopping and going back to the beginning. The letterbox is annoying. I have a 65-inch so I can tolerate it but if you have less that a 55-inch I suspect you will have difficulty seeing detail. My score considers all of the technical problems. If it were not letterboxed and worked properly the first time it would be much higher."
1,Don't buy !,"I remember seeing this movie several times as a kid. Great war movie, well done. Ordered the Movie 'The Night of the Generals' in the DVD format. When it arrived I put in my DVD player and nothing happened, then I tried another machine, same thing, not even a message saying ERROR or NO DISK, just nothing. Sent if back received a replacement....Same thing. Distribution Company is called The Castaways and it is either Chineese or Korean I cannot tell. I would still love to have the movie from a reliable manufacturer. Amazon delivery was great, so was their cust. service, I only wish they could find a better distribution company for this particular product !"
4,From a viewer in Pennsylvania who likes dialogue in films.,"The object of any murder mystery is to keep the viewer or reader in suspense. The Night of the Generals succeeds. When I saw this film in the mid-sixties, I was spellbound. Yes, I was distracted with subplots and a film with a somewhat sluggish pace. But shouldn't a murder mystery work at distracting and confusing the viewer? When the murderer is finally revealed, you will feel rewarded at the final outcome. Although I enjoy Omar Sharif's acting abilities, I think someone else could have been better suited for his role as the investigator. Sadly, no one has bothered to complement Maurice Jarre for a brilliant score. His macabre waltz which is played throughout the film is chilling. View this film with the lights off and the receiver off the hook."
5,Just learn how to use them.,"These product right is very good. I've been practicing for a while with them and the seem to work just fine. For filling, shading and tracing lines are just great. Like any other media(ink, markers, colors) that needs to be mixed, all you gotta do is learn to mixed them together when you're doing shading. Get some inking instruction so you won't mess up ur work by overlapping to many shades. Beginners can have alot of fun with this assorted pens."
4,"Spectacularly unlikely, but such juicy ye olde time Gothic fun!","Set in 1850s London, downtrodden but fiery doctor's daughter Bella is saved from a life of prostitution by dashing politician Guy Raven, and is pressed into a marriage of convenience with Guy once a Scandal erupts. How can she make Guy love her, and escape the machinations of the vile criminals who were determined to sell her into white slavery?A little contrived, and some of the historical detail is not particularly convincing, but it's a lot of fun, and I tore through it in a few days. It's a diverting gothic melodrama, and definitely worth a read!"
1,Head the warning,"Mine didn't work from the beginning. The flame comes on, sputters and then goes out. Don't even think of buying one of these."
2,"Style points, but poor performance","I bought this primarily to light my MSR camp stove on camping trips and to start camp fires. After only a few uses, I have to press down on the switch several times before it glows red (other than that you can't tell it's lit) and it's completely useless for lighting my camp stove because the flame won't reach into it far enough (or at all, really). So, I have the coolest lighter made (although construction is cheap upon close inspection) that will light a camp fire only after a dozen clicks of the ignitor and I have to carry a 50 bic lighter to light my stove. It sure looks cool though - want to buy mine? -Q"
1,Cool looking-zero quality,"Nice looking, mine performed great, for about a month, then literally fell apart. It isn't of any higher quality than an average five dollar butane lighter. Grossly overpriced. It has the looks, but it lacks the quality. When a 99 cent Bic disposable outlasts your cool looking 35 dollar lighter, you'll realize, like me, beauty really is only skin deep."
3,not for me,"the boots are great for the winter and snow -- truly. they keep your feet warm and are fairly comfortable. but the style is not for me. i had no idea they would look so much like motorcycle-riding boots and make my feet look so monstrous. others may like the look, but it's simply not my style.lesson learned: don't buy winter boots online, without first seeing them in person."
3,Just as described...,Recieved book right on time! Exactly what the seller said came in the box. Brand New!
4,Easy and likeable,"This book has what I enjoy in a cozy little book. The main character, Abby, is someone I would like to be friends with. The secondary characters are interesting --I love Max-- and the town seems like a nice place to visit. The characters are not completely defined yet, but there is enough there to show glimpses of what could be a nice little series. More importantly, I want to read more about these characters and see how they develop in the next book.This story flows along nicely, and doesn't feel forced. I like that the author didn't make this an intense whodunnit with a bunch of ridiculous clues to try and mislead the reader. The book is exactly what it's supposed to be; a light read perfect for a cold day and some homemade hot chocolate."
4,Great first book!,Just discovered the series and throughly enjoyed this book. Can't wait to read the next one! Sammi Carter ranks right up there with Joanne Fluke and Diane Mott Davidson!!!
3,The Minkowski is the best of the three recordings,Mark Minkowski's recording of the work is the most distinctive of the three recordings(I have listened to it 1000's of times for more than a decade). The recording by Alessandrini is also excellent and worth considering
2,"Wanted to like it, but...","I agree with another reviewer, this salmon was far too bland. I grew up eating smoked fish in Scandinavia, and the fish was always bursting with this salty, smoky, fantastic flavor. Unfortunately, this salmon was truly tasteless in comparison. I understand that the natural oils included in the package were for moistness, but the oil smelled, to me, like watery tuna on the verge of spoiling. The color was really close to gray, which also put me off. I really wanted to like it, but nope. Perhaps if you prefer extremely mild and extremely moist salmon, this might be for you. But don't look for a truly smoky, pink salmon, as you will not find it here.It did arrive fast and they did have really good airtight packaging for the salmon."
3,flawed - but accurate and marked for strong performances,"The transfer is poor, and the overall quality leads a lot to be desired. It feels as if the film's scope exceeds it's budget at times, and the entire film suffers a little for it. Wales is a poor sub for South Africa. The directing is stilted and very 'presentational' few risks are taken and the pace resembles travel in the pre-victorian era - slow and mostly painful. The VO choices are over the top, and Winstons distinct growl is an audio cartoon of itself.That said, the film is an accurate depiction of Churchill's early years, and is painstaking researched. The locations are perfect, and the sets do justice to the era, even if they're lit like a TV stage.The performances are uniformly excellent, and Shaw is at his best as Randolph Churchill. Worth a watch for Churchill enthusiasts and history buffs. Downton Abbey fans will likely be disappointed."
3,Faithful to its source (unfortunately),"This film is quite faithful to its source, ""My Early Life"", a partial autobiography published in 1930 when WSC's career was fully in the dumpster and he was thought to be a mere divider between the two brilliant Randolphs, his father and his son.The book is a crackling read, full of the old umpity-oof, as P. G. Wodehouse might say. It is particularly engaging in that every reader knows more about the brash young upstart at its center than did the middle-aged failure who wrote it.I have given the film just three stars because of this very faithfulness. Alas, the film is paced like a book, not a movie. What seems dazzling in the leisurely spaces of the 367-page 1949 edition is simply leaden when put on the screen with its quite different rhythm.By the way, WSC's father, Lord Randolph Churchill, died of syphilis, not of a tumor, as the film makes quite clear."
5,The title says it all,"A must have. Helpful not only in what to say to others, but also therapeutic messages for the reader."
2,Straw man,"I wouldn't recommend this book. Chapter 3 is a clear straw man version of Sartre's philosophy and so it's criticisms are irrelevant. However, I don't think the author intentionally built a straw man argument. I simply think he was more concerned with refuting Sartre than understanding him."
5,We are not worthy,"Oh what a great set of songs - there is something so comfortable about Keb Mo's work. The music is infectious and the man's voice is unique.(plus he sure can play). He has a wide range of tricks in his blues bag and he uses them all. The track ""mommy can I come home"" will just tear at your heartThis CD is going to spend a lot of time in my car - great music to drive to at night Another winner Keb!"
4,Keb Mo continues to entertain,"This is my third Keb Mo (a/k/a Kevin Moore--how about that for tongue in cheek humor--in his name, as well as his music) CD. His best was the self-titled CD ""Keb Mo"". His lyrics and his rockabilly, kicked back blues are always enjoyable. The 2nd or 3rd listening and you are singing along! When I saw him in concert here in Charleston, SC, it was hard to not sing or hum out loud.Pick any CD by this masterful blues man, but only his first CD would get 5 stars from me--call me picky."
3,"Keb has 3 great CD's, this isn't one of them","Keb has three great CD's, this isn't one of them These songs are good, even thought provoking, but every theme stated has been better expressed on a earlier disc. Oh well, I still enjoy his other three discs. Even the Cardinals don't have a winner every game."
5,The second adult CD,"This cd, has a lot of great love/pop balads like, Tengo Todo Exepto a Ti and Entregate, it is a good CD."
5,The Change continues,"After singing La Incondicional Luis Miguel makes a change in the way people think of him by proving that he is a great singer for all ages and not only for the youngers, I truly recommend it beatuful songs of Juan Carlos Calderon in a great voice. There is also a song in Spanish performed before by Michael Jackson( Don't blame it to the boogie). Hear it."
5,"Has eligido bien, porque sabes que soy, soy Oro de Ley!!!!!!","Luis Miguel ha tenido muchisimas super canciones desde el debut de este disco, pero es mi opinion que este sigue siendo el mejor disco de su carrera. Sin lugar a duda, las canciones en este disco siguen siendo de una persona joven, lleno de esperanza, listos para dar y recibir amor, personas completas con alta autoestima. LM sigue siendo la maxima estrella mmasculina de Latino America. No me crees? Dime quien mas, de gira solo, llena todas las butacas en un coliseo o arena en todos los continentes de America incluyendo a EU?"
1,disappointed,"I should return this item. It arrived chipped at the top on both the inside and outside. I'm keeping it only because I love the color and need it in my kitchen. I do not think the damage happened in shipping; I think it happened before shipping, in production."
4,"Pretty dated, but still interesting.","I think there is an opportunity for someone to write a modern account of what you would find underground in New York City and how and when it got there. The concept itself is fascinating that there is a whole separate city below the city that most of us will never see.That said, Granick's account of the world beneath New York is definitely interesting, but it could go deeper (pun intended) into detail and is really in dire need of an update.If the idea of learning about the literal underworld of New York City is interesting to you, this is the best book I've come across."
1,Wrong size,"Using your site, it pointed me to this model based on my car. When I received the product, it would not fit.something is wrong with your site...Thanks and PEACE!!!Christopher"
2,"¿ Lo vas a comprar?...""At your own risk"".","Compré el CD de L.A.-Wilkins-N.Y y muy pocas canciones me gustaron. Me extraño que en este album no se incluyeran las canciones escritas. La presentación del CD luce muy pobre. En este CD, Wilkins graba junto a Carlos Alomar y Michael Sembello, es decir que éstos son los productores del album, en el cual se reflejan dos tendencias de sonido del Este y el Oeste de lo E.U. La única canción que merece cinco estrellas es ""Corre y Buscalo"" un tema espiritual que alimenta el alma."
3,Eh...,"Since this is my first phone, I must say it does serve it's basic purpose of being a cell phone. However, the service is too expensive for anyone planning to use the phone more than a few minutes a day. The ringtones are good, the games suck, the texting is good, the wallpapers suck, the tools are good, the customer service sucks A LOT (and costs the same airtime to talk to, and it takes like 2 minutes to get through the menu, a minute of holding, and then they don't even know how to help you so you're out like a buck for nothing everytime you call.)This is a good starter phone or a good emergency only phone, but that's about it."
3,Terrible Battery Life,"If you don't use the phone, you'll have to charge it every other day. If you talk on it, even just a little bit, it will go dead in about 2 hours.Reception on the phone is so-so."
1,dishonest service,"First of all, my 8610 has what I would call barely passing qualities. It only works in high density population areas, goes out underground, and is very hard to hear conversations with. The main reason I am writing this is the dishonest service I have gotten from Virgin Mobile. They added an extra service to it, ""Joke of the Day"", without me giving the OK, and charged me for it. I hadn't used my phone in a week and discovered all of these ""Jokes of the Day"", and a with a message from Virgin, a week ago, telling me they were starting the ""Joke"" service, with payment, unless I indicated not to. I feel that I should be given the choice of saying ""Yes"" or ""No"" before the service is started. Well, the ""Joke"" is on them, I'll be dropping them and looking for someone more honest and reliable. Also, I know someone else who had Virgin pull a similar stunt on. the person stopped the 'extra' service, and later on, VIrgin started it up again, without notifying them."
2,Prettyr predictable book,"This book is really good in the beginning, but the ending is pretty bad. R.L. Stine doesn't explain enough on what happens at the end. This book will disapoint you."
1,Stay away,"I was never able to set it up for my windows 2000 machine and I am trying to return it. Tried the latest drivers, etc. The program crushed and even after I uninstalled it I am having some popup windows after rebooting complaining that some drives are missing."
3,Good and Bad - But works good for me.,"Yes, it does have the issues described below. However, I am able to share the drive with the family via a local network and I am no longer confined to having a computer on somewhere to share files, music, etc. My wife is happy, my kids are happy, and so am I. So far (2 months) - it has been reliable.They need to do away with their driver mentality and go for a more integrated feel to the device's setup proceedure. However, this is good technology and do not sell it short based on some startup type pains. It can only get better if it gains in popularity."
1,Reads like a doctoral dissertation.,"While there might be some interesting information in this book, it's all in the presentation. This book reads like a dry doctoral dissertation. It was grueling.Perhaps I was expecting something else, however. I really wanted a book on Huna, and this is not it. This is a dry dissection of the history of religion in Hawaii, with little of the philosophical teachings of the huna belief system. (Huna and the religion he talks about are two different things.)So, I suppose if you simply want to read a dry history of the topic, you might find it interesting. I sure didn't. If you're looking for Huna, look to""Fundamentals of Hawaiian Mysticism""."
5,A Fascinating study of the Hawaiian Pantheon,"Has Scott Cunningham written a book that doesn't show up on every Wiccan's shelf? Even if you aren't interested in the Hawaiian pantheon, the study of the culture alone provides great reading. The information here is priceless, showing that Cunningham actually went to the source rather than to the library"
1,I did not even finish it,"I hardly ever put a book down before I read it all, but this was one of those books I did not finish. If you believe in angels, I guess this is a book for you, but to me it was so unrealistic and impossible, that I stopped reading it after the first chapter."
4,"A very nice read I enjoyed this book it made me recall some of the events that happened in my life they were Angel inspired,",Thank you for sharing your life I know many people will benefit and recount situations that they can now remember as Angel intervention.
3,Angel on Board,"I felt like this book started out strong. It reeled me in from the first page. I love to read books that offer a glimpse of Heaven. However, I felt that it changed from a book about Heaven and angels to a book about life in a rehab clinic. It was great in the first half, but I struggled to finish. I hate to give anything less than a 5 star review, but maybe my comment can be used a constructive criticism. I'm still glad I took the time to read this book."
5,Don't make 'em like this anymore,"I used these when I worked out in the corporate world, and they were bulletproof.Now, our church needed a good backup printer. For less than a office grade laser jet, we get flawless black and white with no paper jams from this ""older"" HP laserjet. And I already know how to use it!! :)"
1,Ours exploded too,"We really liked the warmer feature, but the top glass just exploded randomly today. Now I see lots of other reviews with the same thing happening. I would suggest not buying this product for safety reasons."
1,Don't buy it,"Great while it works right. My temperature controls are WAAAAAAY off...by 50 degrees. Takes two hours to bake a potato. Mine is only a year old and I used it almost every day. Bought an oven thermomter and tested it....results above. Liked everything else about it...but have had bette, cheaper toaster ovens."
1,Dangereous,"The first one I bought burned out after a year but I liked the look so much I bought a second one. Three months later the top glass cover shattered right after I had taken out the toasted slices. Fortunately I had stepped away from the unit so I was not hurt. Very dangerous. If you already have one dont use it, if you dont, dont ever buy one."
5,life-changing,"This is a beautifully written examination of a problem I've really struggled with. Marla Paul has a smart and elegant style and makes you feel like she is a friend who has struggled with it, too. I finished this book eager to try some of her suggestions, and reassured that I'm not the only one who has stumbled in friendship attempts. Great advice given with warmth and humor - a pleasure and an inspiration."
2,Another airhead towards males,"What does this ""expert"" know about males? And to say men don't need friends shows she either has extreme tunnel vision or is out of her head!"
4,4 Stars But............,"............why is this movie so freakin' expensive???!!! It's old and there are basically no extra features. It's a really good movie and I would love to buy it, but I am not paying that much for it. I guess I'll have to wait a few years for the price to come down."
4,THE CAINE MUTINY (COMBAT CLASSICS),"This movie has an excellent cast. Humphrey Bogart was a gifted actor.On the other hand, it is more satisfying to read the book, THE CAINE MUTINY, by Herman Wouk, because I make pictures in my mind of the people I read about, and often ""my pictures"" clash with those of the movie. Furthermore, the small, yet most important sentences, are left out, and so one receives a superficial content of the story.Herman Wouk is one of my favorite authors, if not my most favorite author. He is still alive. He lives in Palm Springs, and said in an interview - I think it was in the NEW YORK TIMES - that he feels he still has two books in him before he is leaving thisworld. I am looking forward to those books. May the Lord keep him well to reach his goal.Josephin E. Sieroty."
5,Review of the Blu-ray version,"I haven't seen this movie on regular DVD - only on TCM (HD). The Blu-Ray version is a lot better than the movie that was on TCM.The print is pretty clean, and the color is reasonably accurate. I've seen better sharpness in some Blu-ray discs, but this one was adequate.Aspect ratio was 16:9, and the DVD had subtitles.Bottom line: I'm glad I spent the extra $4.80 for the Blu-ray. This classic is worth it."
3,Another great compaltion from the Boston Boys,I love this CD. The remixes are off the hook. The only thing that makes me mad is that Booby Brown has the most songs. Come on it's a New Edition cd.
3,"Good shipping time and delivery, poor quality","I received this product in a very timely manner which I was happy about. The glasses came just as they were in the photo, I own 2 other pair of Spy Cooper glasses so I was looking forward to adding the all white frames to my small collection. I have just opened the box and compared them to a second pair and have confirmed these ""brand new"" frames are bent. I am a little disappointed since they are a solid plastic frame and cannot be adjusted. I have laid them flat on several surfaces and each has confirmed that they are significantly bent on the left side. The black pair I own and the grey pair both lay perfectly, but these white ones have a good inch and a half raise to the left side. Great color and fit around the eyes, but now they do not sit right on my ears which becomes noticably uncomfortable. Not sure if this is a company or Amazon defect, but will buy from a vendor and try on before purchasing in the future."
3,An exciting disappointment ...,"The first in a series named Wagons West, this book chronicles the New York-to-Independence (Missouri) leg of the first wagon train moving settlers to the Oregon Territory in 1837. The story is interesting, and the characters are well developed. However, the prose is a little simplistic: tensions are not maintained and conflicts are resolved too easily. It reminds me of a script for an old TV western series!"
2,Love Neil Sedaka songs,I thought this dvd would be better. There were too many songs I did not care for. The older great songs he sand did not seem to be with the quality they had when they first hit the market. Age has taken its toll.
2,The Worst Opening Credits Song,"No kidding. Jack Jones sings ""This World Is Yours"" over the opening credits--the lyrics are said to be by the great Doc Pomus, who penned may of those old Elvis greats, but it's repetitive and draws on the title line too much. The slightly-off-color parody of the folk classic ""Wings Of an Angel"" that Peter Falk sings while swinging from a chandelier are almost as good. And the film goes downhill from there, drawing from many of the cliches in the TV series ""Combat"" of that same era. A B film if ever there was one--it's unbelievable that Dino DeLaurentis directed this. But Peter Falk's ""Columbo"" was a few years away, and Robert Mitchum was in a huge gulf between his bravura performance in ""Heaven Knows Mr. Allison"" and his role in ""Winds Of War""/ ""War and Remembrance""."
2,"too simplistic, little insight into organizational dynamics","This book fails to recognize that power dynamics are now far more organizational and structural than they were in the times that most of this books examples have been drawn from.This is not the age of city-states. This is the age of the massive orgazization.You'd be better off reading ""Corporate Cults: The Insidious Lure of the All-Consuming Organization"" (by Dave Arnott) to get a clear understanding of the way environments are shaped socially and informationally.This is closer to the real world that we must operate within.You'd also have a clearer insight into power if you read the book ""Toxic Sludge is Good For You"". Toxic Sludge may be the clearest, although dated, study of how power of human lives is expressed through the media and ""the engineering of consent"", by controlling which images and stories the public is allowed to see in oder to form its idea of what reality actually is."
5,Always Say Less than Necessary...,"The best book I have read on Management, Strategy and Life. It is a book that you can use in your every day life, and it does not have to be related to work at all...The 48 chapters include some of the best historic stories from all over the world, very entertaining, and helpful...It gives you a better idea how to approach certain situation, how to read people better, and how to make a difference in your every day life...Another good thing about Robert Green is the simplicity of the message, the back up to his theories with practical examples, and the energy level that he transmits through the stories...A great book, if you don't want to read the whole thing, choose the chapters that interest you the most..."
2,Chuck's Review,"A very heavy read and a bit of a disappointment. Too wordy for the message and, frankly, lazily researched. How many times can P. T. Barnum be used to illustrate different points on personal power?"
1,Disgusting! Don't buy this book!,"If you want a guide on how to be manipulative, amoral and corrupt at everyone else's expense...this is for you. As for me, I was disgusted from page one....it goes completely against everything I believe in. ""Never put too much trust in friends"" ...must be awfully lonely in such a world where you can trust no one. Perhaps that's because you've stabbed everyone in the back. This ""looking out for #1"" at all costs is what is wrong with the world today. If any book EVER deserved to be burned...this is it!"
3,Hmm..,"This is one of those books that contains substantial truth, but shouldn't be treated as gospel. For example, there is the chapter on 're-inventing yourself' where he advises you to do everything you can to seem larger than life.The example he gives for this chapter is the one of Julius Ceasar, who kept the people entertained with extravagant arena games and so forth.Of course, as the author himself points out, Julius Ceasar ended up dead.And that's the problem. As the author himself admits, these 'rules' can certainly backfire and, many would argue, almost always do."
5,A Great Book Not To Be Taken Lightly,"It took me a while to finish this book simply because there is so much information in it. I will not dwell on a lengthy analysis of the book but will get to the point. This book contains many great concepts that everyone can learn from. I, myself, learned from it because it had me think about certain situations in ways I had not previously considered before. It may not be everyone's moralistic cup of tea but it does present the information you need if you want to be competitive in any business endeavor.To the point, this book teaches you how to be a winner in corporate society. By corporate I mean if you are out to gain power and wealth then you can learn from this book. If you are out to be a good, honest, moralistic business person or worker then this book will give you insight as to what to watch out for.I highly recommend it!"
4,It's a Book & Not a Manual,"Though the book is well written and I do enjoy the history examples, but at the end of the day, it is JUST a book. Take (the book) with a grain of salt.You have the right to use said ""Power""You have the right to NOT use said ""Power""Free Will, people.Free Will."
4,If there was only one ideal position there would be no need for strategy,"A combination of Gracian, Sun-tzu, machiavelli, and other great strategists have made this book a very good read, simply Greene is the string that combined them together. The short stories and the delivery message are very good, a lot of readers get a bit irritated by the fact that a lot of contradictions occur for every law as there is a reversal. The point is to see the big picture, because emotions and situations vary,,,,as Porter put it if there was only one ideal position there would be no need for strategy. A very good book."
4,Laws Made to be Broken,"I felt guilty buying this book, as if people would think me strange so I slipped it in a pile of Playboy issues so no one would notice.Really, I shouldn't have felt bad. It's filled with historical anecdotes from which, the author tries to extrapolate ""laws"" of power, defined as getting people to do what you want.It's fun to read but simplistic in ingoring motivational theory or moral suasion.It is designed for those who think they have to wheel and deal their way to the top by fooling others. I have known the type and while temporarily successful, inevitably they fail and lose the respect of everyone.A better book to read and follow for getting people to do what you want is Greenleaf's Servant Leadership."
3,Another product of the imagination,"If you have wild dreams of pontifical success. Illusions of grandeur and great lusts for power, then this book may feed your ego. It may even make you feel real good about yourself. Knowing all these secrets of power. But alas, it is only a fantasy.This should be aptly titled a book on office politics. Robert Greene is a great storyteller, hypnotist. He can tell stories with such dramatic storylines. It gets people mesmerized.Real world social success and networking is quite different. If you can't see the difference, then most of ""your successes"" from these laws are ""superficial successes"" who could care less about you. Sure they will talk to you and say hi to you and may return your phone calls, but if you consider that success, then you know nothing about what people can do for you.This is a teenager's fantasy book."
2,Kindle edition is terrible,"So, the book itself is interesting and might even be helpul in some business dealings, however the Kindle edition is rife with typos, including some sections that are actually not legible because of the garbled text. In other Kindle books, I have encountered the occasional typo or strange, misplaced carriage return; never entire section headings with not one single legible word."
2,Good But Long Winded,"It has some usable points, but it' best just to read the table of contents. The chapters dive into long winded explainations that you'll almost never come across in life, but may in a blue mooon. Good for a read if you like ironic and well thought out plans to trick others that may or may not work.Gary Nakauchi"
1,Kindle version,Never purchase this book for the Kindle. It is full of so many typos and misspellings that it is not worth the purchase at all.
4,Optimize yourself and others,"This book shows you how people throughout the ages manipulate situations and others. You will gain insight into the real world with this book. Learn how to optimize yourself, others and every circumstance. Read books like The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to learn how to lead yourself and get along with others and Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self, to learn how to bring your best self to any situation, make the most of it and bring out the best in others."
1,You're Better Than This!,"Most people perfunctorily use the 48 laws in their everyday lives whether they realize it or not. We're hard-wired to follow suit, seek groups of like, and cater to the fantasies or others vs. what it visceral and intrinsic to us. These silly politics keep us from forming real, meaningful, honest relationships with others, and more importantly, with ourselves.It's difficult, but ascending above the politics that are ostensibly ubiquitous to human-nature could prove a far superior and more worthy venture. I recommend 'The Four Agreements' by Don Miguel Ruiz to anyone looking to be freed and ascend beyond the pro forma/ conformism of it all."
3,Its ok,"Its okay, but I would take it out from the library to read instead of buying the book. Great examples."
5,Lots of thought provoking gold nuggets!,"Intriguing to read the laws and see how they manifest in your own world. If you are a part of an organization or network where politics count and yes that is most of us, this book will inspire and assist you with assessing the various aspects and ramifications of your actions. The book is probably most valuable for brain exercise rather than actual life application. Without a doubt a nice addition to any library!"
2,Self defeating,"While you concentrate on destroying those around you injuring yourself in the process, those billions NOT in your immediate vicinity climb over all the smouldering corpses to get ahead.Might as well punch everyone while trying to get to the fire exit."
2,"Should be titled ""Deceit & Corruption""",Teaches corruption and hatred. I only read the preface and 2 chapters. Cannot put this malice in my demeanor. ill!
4,Good service,The book came when it said it would and it look good. I had no problems with getting my book.
2,"Insightful, But Overwhelming","This is very well-written and researched. However, the format means it probably works best for readers willing to read parts of it at a time rather than in one sitting."
5,The Power of the 48 Laws of Power,"This is a great CD book. It was very interesting to listen to the laws and relate some of them to things that people at work are currently doing, some that I am currently doing, some to implement and some to watch out for. I would recommend this book to management level people working in a political office."
2,This Guy is a Blow Hard,"I gave this book a two star because it has some words of wisdom, but you have to wade through a lot of bad information. Reading through the table of contents, you'll see that quite a few of the ""laws"" boil down to ""be a back stabbing sleaze bag"". On the other hand, there are a number of the laws that are worth following. I leave determining which is which as an exercise for the reader. The anecdotes do not back up the laws that he is demonstrating."
5,An open mind,"This book will open your eyes further than you have imagined that they could go. There are some negative reviews floating around, and while some aspects of this book are hard to grasp, I feel that the negative comments surface from a lack of open-mindedness.The 48 Laws of Power will allow you to analyze what ever environment you are in, you will start to see how people act in a more defined way. You will finally understand your surroundings like you have never imagined.An open mind, is a mind that will learn from this book. 5/5"
3,have not read it yet,"Knowledge is power, knowledge of True Love is ultimate power. Infinite virtue is Love and Love reigns supreme over nearly everybody."
1,Vapid self-help for the feckless,"Really, what else need be said? Just another vapid motivational self-help book.About all that can be said in its favor is that it's cheaper than one of those multi-$1000 empowerment seminars that suckers go to, and that it's less dangerous than a half-baked New Age yuppie sweat lodge that kills people."
3,Better for nect than back,"Tried to use in car on recent 3 week vacation. Could never get comfortable with it between my back and seat, however, it was great for resting the neck while riding as passenger. Not much use while driving"
5,Best cat litter on the market.,"This stuff blocks odors, clumps the best and has NO DUST. I tried other similar ""leading brand"" litters and they did not block odor or clump as well and kicked up dust when filling or cleaning the box."
4,VG if combined with green tea leaf litter,"Like any other cat people, I like the litter boxes clean and odor free. I used different kinds such as regular clay, news paper type litter, world's Best, and my favorite Breeze. However, my youngest cat suddenly stopped using the box, what a nightmare. So I went back to doing experiments on different litter to lure my cat to use the box again. I like Nature's Miracle because it is almost powder free and yet very fine, it clumps too. I decided to combine it with the green tea leaves litter, I like the outcome. I like green tea leaves litter's natural smell. The two compensate each other's weaknesses. As for my problem cat, she now seldom use the floor for her pooping need. My two other cats really prefer Nature's Miracle and Green tea leaf combination to poop, but they use Breeze when urinating."
4,Book got the job done,"Was my only source for exam prep and passed on my first attempt. Thought the section on unattended installations was very good. Was my first exam taken overall and have begun to study for the Server exams and am finding that much of the material presented in the Server prep book I have already learned through this book. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to pass the Workstation 4.0 exam. I am relatively knew to the computing industry, so I don't have alot of computing background to rely on, so I feel that this book played a much greater role in my passing the exam than my work experience did. That said, the book worked for me. Good Luck."
5,Nick Jr. Favorites 4,My son has been asking for this video and this is the only place I could find it. It loves it and watches it all the time.
2,Disappointing read,"I tried to get into this book, and at points, I actually succeeded. However, once one 'overlooks' the Old-World superstitions and stories that are not well explained, one is dropped, just as the pearls from the mother's wedding gown. I fought my way through the book and clung to the excuse that the translation into the English language must have watered down its appeal. However, my struggle was not rewarded and once I finally did find myself caring about the characters, the book ended and left me feeling disappointed and disinclined to pick up the sequel (if one is ever written.)"
4,Probably the best Christie,"This book is very different from other Christie's book and is much better. For once, her characters are not simple caricatures easy to forget. They have real, deep feelings, they suffer, and the reader believe in that. The book acts like a charm that makes the reader enter in it deeper than in other Christie's work. The mystery plot is surprising but not really important. What is important is the picture of three or four key characters (only women, by the way). That makes this book closer to PD James work. Highly recommended."
4,Good story - weak ending,"I've read many Agatha Christie's books and I really liked this one. I was so involved by the description of the characters personality and I even pictured de mansion in my mind. I did not like the ending tough. I think that the plot could have been better explained. All those pages describing caracters and only a few pages to solve the mistery. I also found the ending a little confusing, with unnecessary information."
4,very good,"I come fast, but the book was not in very good conditions. The book has some pages with coffe and you can no see very well some words"
2,"Very overrated, listen to the original masters first","It's not a BAD CD, but nothing particularly fresh - like classic Mississippi Delta blues filtered through the Allman Brothers and with a dash of Phish. It's good stuff but nothing remotely like the ""savior of the blues"" some hype it as - once again, a (mostly) white band does what black musicians have been doing for years and gets the credit; go listen to RL Burnside, Junior Kimbrough or any of the other Fat Possum records artists for some REAL down and dirty juke joint blues that'll blow you away."
2,Not worth it.,Didn't find it very useful. It was a waste of money and time. would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,The Librarian - Return to King Solomon's Mines,"I really enjoyed the 1st Librarian (Quest for the Spear) and so was kind of disappointed with the 2nd installment in the series (will there be a 3rd?).The premise sounded good...who doesn't love the King Solomon's Mines theme? Well, anyway, I do. But not this one, at least not so much.Noah Wylie, Jane Curtain and Bob Newhart are back and the dialogue between them is enjoyabe. The utter lameness of the story is only truly revealed in the last half hour and it's not even enjoyable cheesy lameness--it's just dumb.That being said, I hope there is a 3rd and the writing is much sharper. It's a premise that's fun and seems like a lot more could, should be done with it."
5,The Librarian - Return to King Solomon's Mines,The movie was in condition stated. I am very happy with it. I really didn't like having to wait 4 weeks before receiving it though.
4,the librarian-return to king solomon's mines,"found it to be an entertaining blend of facts and fiction.the main character ,played by Noah Wylie, is no little old lady that seems to be the common idea of a librarian. this over achiever(21 degrees) is no book worm only ,but the man to protect and collect the legendary artifacts of our world.The light hearted approach to peril and the other characters made it an enjoyable piece ."
3,pleasant,The music is pleasant to hear. Typical Burmese harp music in short excerpts (the traditional form is always so long in length). Sound quality is okay and maybe because I bought it online through mp3.
4,Pleased,I have used this product many times before. I really like it. I am just happy to be able to buy it conveniently online. The product is just as great as always. Nongreasy!
4,It is very difficult to put any of the novels in this series,Another excellent Hornblower adventure that I thoroughly enjoyed.
4,,"This album is a real monster. Their last EP showed signs of something of a scary magnitude that was building up. Now here it is, Armada in all its glory and rightfully deserved critical acclaim. This is the definition of a band revolutionizing their sound within extreme black metal and succeeding in keeping it pure. This is some of the fastest riffing you'll ever get to hear, it works for the sake of completing a song rather than make it sound fast for the sake of being fast. The same goes for the drumming, which is precisely insane, and right on the spot. The real accomplishment here is the songwriting which is epic, yet brutal and majestic, yet uncompromising. This is true black metal for the new age. 4.5/5"
3,Good way to introduce someone to modern jazz.,"Stevie Wonder wrote some great lyrics, but he excelled at making those lyrics into a memorable tune. Everyone will know these tunes, thus the familiarity helps make the style of music more accessible. Highlights include ""Living for the city"" and ""Summer soft"". The perfect CD for Sunday afternoon drinks; upbeat, familiar and unintrusive."
5,A Must Have for the Asimov Fan,"I have been an avid fan of Asimov’s since I was a teenager. I have read everything the man ever wrote, sometimes three or four times. He has a way of creating such colorful and realistic characters, organizations, and even future technology. Asimov had a talent for taking real world problems of the time and placing them on a grand scale thousands of years into the future. What I loved about this book was getting to know more about the beloved character of Hari Seldon and his creation of Psychohistory. I think anyone who enjoys Asimov or science fiction will enjoy this book!"
4,Prelude to the foundation,"This novel shows a more mature Asimov as a writer. Very entertaining, with a surprising element of romance which is most unusual for him."
4,God Revealed,"""Prelude to Foundation"" by Isaac AsimovProf. Asimov has a knack for telling a good story. The really interesting part of this is that it is written in 1980 or so, and talks a little about using computers. In some of his older stories, he mentions the 'slide rule guys' figuring stuff out. I suppose that my knowing what a slide rule is dates me some. It is also obvious that he did not write this for serial publication. He can put together a good book with some disparate magazine stories, but this is written differently. It would have been possible to serialize it, but it was not, that I know of.In the end it turns out that robots are God."
3,Entertaining scifi novel. A little boring in parts.,"This was the first Asimov book I've ever read. It was entertaining, but lacked the depth of a Ray Bradbury or Arthur C Clarke novel. Basically the story was more there to entertain you than captivate you. I am a big fan of Clarke's 2001 and Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and if you've read those you know what I mean by both of them having gripping stories. This book wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I'll get around to reading the rest of the series at some point, but I'm in no hurry after reading this one."
3,"Sounds Good Sometimes, but save up for a Better one",This guitar i have owned for 2 years and it doesnt always sound good. plus every time i pick it up it has to be re-tuned and i have tried putting new strings and everything on it but it still has to be retuned every time its picked up which is annoying but all other things 5 star. (SAVE UP FOR A MORE EXPENSIVE ONE!)
5,Fashionably thought provoking,"I bought this bag for my 16 year-old daughter and it is both a fashion statement (In these days of giving being politically correct) and also a conversation starter. the importance of giving and chosing what to buy, especially among young people. I applaude all of the people and celebrities that have made it ""cool"" for kids to be aware of the importance of giving and the importance of chosing what to buy, especially among young people."
2,feed bag,i won't use the bag afterall as it has an odor and is 'weighty'.Hope some of the price is helping charity.
2,Clear up Bush involvement!,"Please know that THIS is the LAUREN BUSH(NOT Laura Bush, former 1st lady),[...], who is sponsoring the FEED Program WITH the UN!Buy this bag with reservations if you are doing so for feeding the hungry!"
5,feed bag,great way to give a useful gift at an affordable price and do charitable work at the same time. a feel good thing!
5,Awesome bag for a GREAT cause,"This is a great bag! I use it for commuting and can carry all of my belongings in it. I am even going to use it for my upcoming vacation. I can fit so much stuff in it and it's strong and sturdy. This is the perfect bag for a commuter, student, or anyone who carries a lot of stuff with them during the day!"
3,GOOD IDEA YET MISLEADING,"When I first saw this, I thought it was such a wonderful idea! I'm disappointed in the price though-when I received it, it stated that only $20.00 of my dollars would be going to the fund. Top it off, made in China. Where does the rest of the $$ go? It's better to give directly so that MORE OF YOUR DOLLARS GO WHERE THEY ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED!!"
1,why not just donate the whole $60 to a charity instead????,"Why spend $60 for something when only $20 is going to the charity? Hey, if it's a good bag and worth $60 then buy it, but don't fool yourself that you're doing some great deed by giving $40 to a company who is making a cheap burlap bag. There are so many charities out there where you can donate the $60 to and that would really be making a difference. It's always a good idea to check out the actual amount from the purchase the company is donating to a cause.They advertise this bag as ""$20 a year can transform a child's life and provide the tools for a lifetime of self-reliance."" so why not just help out THREE kids and send the $60 directly to the organization? The company should be doing the right thing and donating 100% to the charity but it's often more about the hype than anything else."
5,The Bag that keeps on giving!,i love it! not only can i fit all of my books but it truly is the bag that keeps on giving! everyone should own one. my best spent $60
2,Obtuse and error-riddled,"There are many great math texts that are difficult going at first, but which pay great dividends the more you ""drill down"" into them. While this may have been the case with previous editions of this text, the crazy-making number of errata in this edition make it very difficult going ALWAYS.Furthermore, the ease and small number of exercises aren't enough to get the concepts firmly stuck in your cranium. I'm using three other supplements to get me through my graduate probability/stats sequence. Pbbtt!!"
1,There are better ones out there . . .,"This book is rather strange. In some areas, the explanations are excellent and the book seems to flow well. However, quite often, this book omits crucial steps and, as a result, becomes extremely difficult to follow. Almost every other Math Stat text at this level supercedes this one (at least, in my opinion). I don't know why this book remains the standard. Pick up Freund or Ross; you'll be forced to anyway if you have to use this book."
3,"OK, but not ""critical"" to your collection","I was hoping for a work with a little more analytic meat. It was interesting, but you are not going to find a lot of substance in this book."
5,Highly recommended for little kids going thru a divorce.,"Ordered this book along w/3 others for my 5 & 3 yr old boys who are going thru a divorce between their mom & me. It is their favorite 1 out of the 4 - and it is nice that is places a primary emphasis on the role of the 2 boys with their father. However, mom is not negatively portrayed and gets a fairly equal amount of time in the story. It helps explain to the kids that the divorce is not their fault - but something that is only between the adults. It also helps emphasize that both their parents still love them wherever they go. At times, this story is a little more complicated, but I know the message is getting through. I also highly recommend ""TWO HOMES"", which is a little less complicated and is definitely level-handed for both parents."
2,the wrong Lawrence,Martin Lawrence consitantly overplayed his charactor. I think Matt Lawrence would have been a better choice for this role. They could have called it the mtv generation get's knighted
1,Who wrote this dribble and why did Martin take the part?,"I can't imagine Martin is hard-up for work, but to appear in such a terribly written piece of garbage as this seems to point in that direction. Martin holds his own and is funny while this terrible plot and rotten story unfolds. Don't go if you have anything else to do cause you'll be leaving the theater early to get started doing somthing worth while."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I gave this film one star because it was in color!! Aside from this fact, the thought behind the story seemed to have merit. I guess I was hoping for a lot more of ""A Yankee In King Arthur's Court"" than I got. Horrible, predictable script, stupid presumptions, adolescent attempts at baseline humor.This is no ""Big Momma's House"" by even the most liberal of standards. Hated it."
5,Broken Saints - Showing the potential of the human mind,"I hope that some day Broken Saints will get the general acclimation it deserves. Broken Saints transcends the normal expatiation of Corporate America and is not afraid to be true Art.This is one of those very rare events. Something really new that does not insult the intelligence of the viewer but instead engages you in its story.I was also introduced to the original on-line version by a friend, and while I tend to be a purist and like the on line version better (I miss the haiku poems while the episode was loading for one thing). I definitely recommend buying the DVD. If nothing else to allow these very talented folks to keep creating stories for us.Broken Saints is edgy, uncompromising and well worth supporting. Buy it, watch it, give it to a good friend..."
5,Varied,"Everything you could want is on this album. I'm tempted to call it his best, but I don't want to give an EP that designation.If you're new to Aphex Twin, this is a good place to start. It's [inexpensive] and something on it's bound to please you."
2,What Soundtrack?,"If you are fifteen years old and easily marketed to, this collection of run of the mill rock songs might sound good in your CD player while you're headbanging with your pals. However, if you saw the film and reveled in the terrific score, you'll have to wait for the actual motion picture soundtrack, available in mid June. This isn't neccesarily a bad CD, it just has very little to do with the film."
1,...,"Well here we have anouther cd with deppressing, sreaming, guzzling lyrics. I just wanna say STAY AWAY FROM THIS ...ALBUM."
4,Good CD,"I love the Limp Bizket,Tori Amos,(that spanish song),Metalicca,Powderfinger, and Rob Zombie. Those songs deserve 4 stars right there but the rest of the songs are just well, weak."
2,Maybe the actual movie will be better.,"I'm not a big hard rock...and probably never will be; and to be honest I bought this soundtrack only for the Tori Amos recording ""Carnival""--a satisfying, agressively breathtaking rehash. Unfortunately, not even Tori can save this album from being an overload of mostly mediocre bombastic tracks. Metallica, Foo Fighters, and Chris Cornell (among others) do what they can with what seems to be a restricted approach to heavy music. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect about this soundtrack is the sheer lack of developmental style as disappointingly heard on Limp Bizkit's very poor ""Take a Look Around"" and Rob Zombie's flat ""Scum of the Earth"". Powderfinger, however, is a nice discovery with ""My Kinda Scene"" which drifts softly into a wonderful, if stereotypically, mellow manner. If only there was a mission to replace some of these noisily fizzled-out tracks with whiskey hardened tunes, then maybe we'd have something; but I fear that would be impossible."
4,Buy it if you want to get really hyper!,"Even though I am not the biggest hard rock/rap fan, I love this CD. Limp Bizkit did a great job at the remake of the theme. The only thing bad that they did with it was that they added words that didn't have to do with the movie, just about themselves. But, if you're feeling tired and want to feel more awake and energized, then listen to one song on here, and no matter which one, it does the job well! It's also, overall, very well done music. This CD kicks (just like the movie)! Please , buy it if you are feeling down, tired, or just plain lazy, since summer's coming up, buy this to get you ready for a great summer day."
3,Decent,"I'm a Metallica fan. I bought this cd because I have to own all of their stuff. I decided that I oculd put up with Limp Bizkit, even though they do butcher a great old theme song. Honestly, though, the Metallica song isn't the best one on here. That honor goes to Buckcherry. Buckcherry reminds me of Guns N' Roses, and they showcase their talent with ""Alone."" Some of the songs one here though are really annoying. Tori Amos really isn't my type of music, the previously mentioned Limp bizkit, and the butthole Surfers are the bands that come to mind. Overall, this isn't THAT bad of a cd, but I would much rather recomend ""Master of Puppets"" or ""...And Justice for All."" Now those are cds!!!"
4,tight song,i always liked this song especially back in the day.Tevin Campbell is one of the most slept on vocal talents from back in the day. He had some strong range. this was one of my jams back in the day. Him&Babyface on songs were unstoppable.
2,"I don't recommend this collection. Get ""in concert"" instead","In this collection, Raffi seems to need a few cups of coffee. The songs are slow and humorless and the arrangements very basic (boring.) However, the best songs in this collection can be found in much more lively versions on the Raffi in Concert album, which is a lot of fun. The singable songs collection is very good too, as is the Christmas album."
2,Closure?,"Feast part 2 does not explain what these creatures are or where they are from.Feast 2 does have a brief scene where one of the characters attempts to study the creature. However, nothing is solved or even slightly explained regarding the creature's origin.In addition, none of the cast is likeable in this movie. The worst scene involves an ""attempted"" rescue of an infant that only you can watch to judge for yourself.If there will be a part three, the producers need to put some closure on the creature's origin and perhaps have at least one or two likeable actors in the movie.There is some suspense and gore. Again, this sequel answers none of the lingering questions from part one.This is a two star product-"
3,solid 3 stars,"This second helping of Feast taste a bit different. This version has beenput in the mixer and what came out is a decent and more gross creaturemovie. Most of it works, and is much better that i tought this movie wouldbe. After a while it almost feels like a ' TREMORS ' movie. Could therebe a Feast 3........i probably would like to see it ...only if there'smore monsters and a decent script."
2,Swan Premium Rubber SNCPM58075 Heavy Duty 5/8-Inch by 75-Foot Black Water Hose,"Kinks to easily which cut off the water supply to the nozzle. Would be okay if you had it installed on a hosereel and, therefore, reeled it out to use and then reeled it back in after use: this would iliminate/reduce the possiblilty of kinking. But if you intend to extend and retrieve it by hand using a hanger-type of hosereel, then use a vinyl type hose that won't kink as easily."
2,Good but not heavy duty...,"I own and use ""heavy duty"" rubber hoses and the true heavy duty hoses do not kink. This one will in a heart-beat."
3,"easy to sing along with, but not authentic","I agree with the other reviewer that the performances aren't traditional, but if you want a CD of shanteys that you can just sing along with while stuck in traffic, this one's at least good for that -- most of the songs performed are upbeat singalongs or perky hornpipes. However, if you're interested in learning more traditional versions or in performances that are more historically accurate to the originals, then I'd skip this one."
1,Good Read,I really like this book. It was refreshing. I was pleasantly surprise that the focus was on family and not lesbianism so much.
1,Homespun wisdom of the most unreadable kind,"I deeply regret having bought this. It is painful to findoneself reading a book that purports to give advice on how to writewhen it is written so badly! Wince-worthy banalities in phoney homespun style. If you want a useful book in a similar vein from Amazon, try STEIN ON WRITING instead. He, at least, can write, and write well. If you want a doorstop or kindling, there are cheaper alternatives."
4,Cheesy title for a very useful and informative book,"Tobias does a good job breaking down common plotlines into their respective patterns. His book provides a method to analyze storylines and identify their basic components, making it easier to understand the underlying structure of the novel or screenplay. He illustrates his ideas through well-chosen examples from the classics as well as modern day literature.Tobias has taken the time to find out what many great authors said and wrote about the nature of their craft. My favorite is a quote attributed to Somerset Maugham: ""There are three rules for writing a novel. Unfortunately no one knows what they are."" This book attempts to identify the rules for story construction in a way that many aspiring novelists will find useful."
1,Look elsewhere for help with plotting,"This author's style is arrogant and condescending toward certain genres. Overall, I found the book to be a rather boring read, and it hasn't helped me much in my efforts to create better plots in my fiction. Mostly, the author spends a lot of time stating the obvious."
3,Quite helpful and easy to read,"I am a grandparent who is again parenting a young teen. I found this book helpful and easy to read. The author has extensive understanding of the teen and his tone is caring. It is not an in depth analysis of why teens are angry. It has, however, some really good insight and advice. I read the review of the teenager and he seems to prove the point of what an angry teen sounds like. Adolescence is a tumultuous time and it is essential that those caring about and for them have some understanding of their feelings. Read it, you will both enjoy it and learn from it. As a matter of fact I will purchase it for our Church Library!"
3,Short Message to Earlier Reviewers,This version of Sons And Lovers was NOT produced by the BBC. They did an adaptation in 1981 but this isn't it. This one was by ITV. The UK does have more than one TV company.
1,i have not received to date,would not deal with this company ever and postage cost are much higher than Ebay and I have not received and will be making a claim
5,So sad COOL is discontinued!!!,I am so sad my favorite perfume in the world has been discontinued. Stocked up giving myself a year to find a new scent!!
5,Audio A's best cd yet!,"Audio Adrenaline's latest cd, Until My Heart Caves In, is awesome. It combines meaningful lyrics with passionate music. Mark Stuart provides powerful lead vocals with great backups by Tyler Burkhum. It's obvious that a lot of time and went into this cd and that the guys put everything they had into it. This is an incredible cd that EVERYONE should listen to."
4,Yoga for me..,"My experience with Yoga for Arthritis, was a very good one..I loved the way it was slow in movement and gentle on my muscles...Didn't like that it would take about an hour or more to do it all..But all and all a good video...:0)"
4,Satisfied Customer,"The DVD is very helpful and very good. It provides an easy, abundant stretching for the muscles. Highly recommended, especially for those reaching older ages who want to save and maintain their mobility. If something is too difficult ( I don't personally see anything too difficult but every person is different), just skip it or modify it as Peggy says. It's a very nice yoga stretch, this DVD."
5,A great Yoga exercise video,This exercise program was perfect for me. I have bilateral knee replacements and there is absolutely no strain on the new joints at all however you still get a good workout for your needs. Great buy for joint replacements and moderate to severe arthritis sufferers.
3,sun saluation a bit anemic,Lots of hand and shoulder rotation. Good for people w arthritis however: the sun salutation glossed over technique prompting during down dog and plank.No mention where your body alignment is during this more strenuous section. The section abruptly ended before the flow was over.It just moved to the next section.Could have used some better editing.Peggy is animated but the others looked waxed.
4,cinderella cake pan,"My daughter wanted a cinderalla cake for her birthday. This pan was a great way for her to have it. I ended up making the frosting myself rather than buying ready made. It took some time to decorate, but I thought it wasn't to hard. It was a bit difficult to get the blue coloring right but that really didn't matter in the long run."
1,Bootleg,"Bootleg alert! It is not worth it to buy this. In some countries, it is in fact illegal to buy these. If you want it, you should seek out traders and make deals with them. It should never be any cost to you, and will trade you for a bootleg you have, or for blank CD's and postage (B & P trading). Do not buy bootlegs, ever, when you can trade them for free."
3,"Good story, but it had a few flaws and a bad climax.","... This book is a real pageturner. I couldn't wait to finally get to a book with some of the Heroes of the Lance. Flint and Tanis have a great relationship. I love reading their interactions. My favorite scenes are of Tanis and Laurana. I know I am a guy, but I do like romance in books! Good story throughout, even though you know who the killer is early on, unless you were a Basketball player from the University of Arkansas. The big problems I did have were that the relationship of Tanis and Laurana is left hanging. I wanted one more scene at the end. The worst part of this book which made me drop it one star is the fact that the ending is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to Scooby Doo. It's really bad. I had all this expectation and it was ruined. Too bad because this could have been a good book."
4,Pleasant reading,"Nicely written, although there were some parts where the flow of the story were simply awkward or jerky. However, the writers were true to the personalities of the characters, and also managed to bring out the true friendship between Flint and Tanis. Altogether, a pleasantly written story about the harsh prejudice Tanis must endure from his elven side before the true meaning of friendship brings him peace and freedom."
1,Not Very Happy!,"The sizzle platter was shown with a wooden base and no where in the description did it say that it came separate or I would have bought the base! The box came to me open with one piece of tape across the top that did not hold, and no packing material- just the metal platters. When I returned the sizzle platters by Priority Mail to the address that they told me, I didn't get my credit because they claim they never got the box. And because I didn't send it UPS or FEDEX with a tracking number, I'm out my money."
4,Old Church Slavonic,"This is a classic in its field. There is no other work in English which I'm aware of which is as exhaustive as Lunt. There is at least one written in pre-1917 Russian which may be better, but none in English. Although used, which I knew before I ordered the book, the copy sent to me is in good shape and I am very satisfied."
3,Needed another editing session.,"I'd say this is the second worst book of the series, but it wasn't as bad as Rules of Engagement, yet it is in need of some serious help. I'd say that this book did have a lot more promise than the one previously mentioned, but it got lost some where in all the extra stuff that the author was trying to stuff into the book without making it look like she was doing so. So what we end up with is a bunch of little stories and sections of ideas that get lost in the overall theme of the book and contribute to the reader feeling lost and wondering why they purchased the book."
2,"Not bad, but when does the *story* start?","I enjoyed the first two of Elizabeth Moon's ""Esmay Suiza"" books immensely. Esmay is a very likable heroine, and she's the same sort of ""trouble magnet"" as Modesty Blaise.*This* book, however, isn't about Esmay. It's about the assassination of a head of state, power politics, technical problems with rejuvenation technology, a mutiny on a prison planet, and a blood feud between the Suizas and Serranos (think Montagues and Capulets with nuclear weapons) Esmay herself appears in no more than about one-sixth of this overly-long book, and she's mostly being shoved around from pillar to post.I have a feeling that Ms. Moon is basically using this book to set the background for what I call ""meal ticket series"" writing, where each book is milked for maximum revenue without regard to entertainment value, and you have to buy *all* the series to understand any of it.I was greatly disappointed with this one."
3,what it really is,"The disappointed tone of many of the customer reviews of C of C come from a misunderstanding of the genre of this particular volume. It is an *Expansion of the Canvas*. Think of ""Two Towers,"" where the trick is performed to perfection. A lot happens, many new characters appear, but not much of the overall action advances. My own opinion is that Moon doesn't do a bad job at all. What generates the disappointment, I believe, is a feature she shares with others who learned much of their craft at the feet of Anne McCaffrey, a certain mechanical tying of loose ends. McCaffrey herself is really bad about it. You can almost hear the click click whirr of the Hollerith cardsorter. ""We haven't tied an end for a while. What shall we tie? (Click click whirr) Ah so (copy card contents. insert.)"" By comparison Moon is artistic. But face it. At some point she *had* to expand the canvas."
2,More loose ends than Don King's Haircut,"I think Ms. Moon must have been uninspired and yet pressed by her editor for a sequel to the otherwise worthwhile Esmay Suiza branch this series. If you have been following this series you will have to read this one (kind of like the second Dune book) but don't expect much satisfaction out of it.Ms. Moon, if you're reading this take your time on the next one. We'll still be here."
2,Change of Command,"I waited for ""Change of Command"" to come out in the paperback edition, and I am really glad I did. This book is so clearly meant to set up/stimulate a desire to buy ""Against all Odds"" that the entire book could easily be seen as being an ""advertisement"" or a marketing ploy to make us REALLY want ""Against.""I certainly desire ""Against,"" but after ""Change ..."" I will definitely wait for paperback edition, and perhaps the used paperback edition. I really hate feeling like I got scewed, but the marketing strategy for this series, now that it is popular, really makes me feel that way.""Change"" is the first E. Moon book I have read where I felt ""cheated,"" as if this books' purpose was to get me to spend money now, and then more money later, just to get the next book so I would have some sense of closure.Baen is certainly not the first bookdealer to use ""suck you in"" marketing, but I thought better of both Baen Books and Elizabeth Moon."
3,Only Half of a Book,"Change of Command is the third (and hopefully not the last) of the series it was a disappointment. While what there was of the book was enjoyable, it was really only half of a book.The characters are familiar and are enjoyable. But you should read the others before this to understand what is going on in this book.My biggest complaint is that it did not bring the story lines to conclusion. While there are 320 pages to this book, it wasn't enough. The few story lines that did come to a conclusion were enjoyable.The main point I think is if you enjoyed this series and plan to continue reading this series then buy this book. You will need it to figure out the next book."
3,"Enjoyable, but","This book gives a great overall view of the world of Esmay Suiza and friends. She fills in alot of background about her universe. The book jumps around somewhat because it covers so many different aspects of the universe. I also felt that it is a setup for the next book (which I certainly hope comes soon) and I would have preferred a long book which answered more questions than it creates. I usually run quickly through Elizabeth Moon's books once to get the action and then read them again for the finer points - I won't read this one again until the sequel it seems to point to is ready to come out. Still, I am looking forward to more books by Moon, and I am glad I have this one now."
5,Handy!,I have used this book for the past three years in all of my German classes. It covers everything you need to know about German grammar and has a lot of useful examples.
2,Not her best,"This is not my favorite of Kathy Smith's DVDs. I do generally enjoy her workouts, but with this this DVD I don't care for the extra long introductions (which you cannot skip over), and also the fact that she does cheesy voice overs for the workouts as opposed to talking throughout the routine. Additionally, the music she chose is horrible, elevator music and not at all motivating. I've done the workouts a few times but mostly this one is sitting on the shelf."
5,All my favorites on one CD!!!,"I was hoping for this to happen one day and now is here! This is a great value CD with Kathy's best weight and cardio complete programs consoildated on one CD! Great job and thanks, Kathy!"
2,Not my cup of tea,"I almost always love Brit mysteries, but I guess I got spoiled on ""Morse"" and ""Lewis"" and ""Peter Whimsey."" I could not get ""into"" Inspector Alleyn Mysteries though I really tried. For me, he has very little personality, intensity and pizazz as do the others I mentioned. I am definitely in the minority I know, but just had to mention how disappointed I am with this series. O well -"
1,this movie raped my suspension of disbelief,"Poor quality, poor acting. I don't know what else to say. Evidently the people that made this have friend/family that like making reviews.I love the movie ""May"", this sir is no ""May"". I hate how people describe movies like this (bland, unimaginative dribble) with unique movies, with truely round characters, like ""May"" I mention ""MAy"" only because a previous reviewer chose to draw the comparison.By the way, I don't know who that is on the cover, but she is not in the movie. Some blond with the same outfit is. It is amazing what 8 pounds of airbrush ink will do to a picture. It sounds cruel, but I couln't help but to think about that the entire movie. ??"
4,Good Looking Recipes,"I flipped through 'Make It Now, Bake It Later' at a bookstore and I really liked what I saw. There is a good variety of recipes along with fun introductions and detailed heating instructions. Not all of the recipes are freezer recipes, but those that are not will keep in the fridge for a few days. I almost bought this book at the bookstore, but I'm glad I waited ($14.95 there vs $3.00 here)."
4,Another Good Muppet Movie,"MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND is another great number from the Henson production house. The Muppets present their take on the classic tale: with Miss Piggy as an island castaway, Tim Curry on fine ham acting as Long John Silver and Kermit returning as Captain Smollet the movie is fun and often incredibly funny.There are the obligatory musical numbers which seem to be a precedent for Muppet movies - but each and every song in MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND does not disappoint. They're all catchy, funny and well-written and presented.The plot takes a supporting role only to the zany antics of Gonzo, Fozzie et al. and the human cameos (another Muppet precedent) will bring a smile to your face: particularly Jennifer Saunders in fine grotesque comedic form."
5,I consider this the best muppet movie yet!,muppet treasure island is inspired by a certain classic that I'm sure everyone knows and me and my family enjoyed it.i recdommed this film for anyone who enjoys the muppets.
4,Best Muppet movie yet,Very funny for both kids and adults. Best Muppet movie yet! Pay attention to the words of the songs to enjoy it even more.
2,scary and not funny,"We LOVE the muppets in our house so i was excited to add to our collection. we were hoping it might be something we could watch with our 2.5 year old (she's pretty sensitive about movies) so my husband & prescreened it. the dialog dragged, the fight scenes were scary. i'd have given it 1 star but we turned it off halfway through so maybe it got better towards the end. two thumbs down."
1,would not purchase again,I purchased the Muppet Treasure Island video for our grandkids to watch during our annual family summer camp. The these this year was water and thought this would fit right in. We did not like the movie... dark on many levels!
4,Why not letterbox?,"I have always enjoyed this film. Only the original Muppet Movie is better. But, the DVD of the Muppet Movie is far superior. Why? The film is letterbox!! Who ever thought of putting this film out nonletterbox should rethink what they are doing."
3,"Cute, But no CD","The book itself isn't the best in the Maisy series, and there was NO CD with this book."
2,Not sensational,This book was hard for me to get interested in. Neither the lead character nor the story held my interest. I found myself skipping many paragraphs to get to the next event.
2,"Fun idea, cute, but . . .","This toy is a wonderful idea with poor quality. I bought this for my daughter and she really enjoyed it, albeit briefly. My biggest complaint was that the paper is glued to the wood, and the glue does not work well enough. Within a week or so of purchasing, and with not much play time, the clothing started to peel off its wood backing. I called the company and left a detailed message. No one ever returned my call, which was disappointing since I was under the impression that they stood behind their products."
4,Good Toy,I purchased this toy for my great niece's second birthday. Her mother said she is able to play with it quite effectively and enjoys it. Her mother and I both agree it should include some type of bag or box to store the pieces in as the container it came in does not have a cover. Good quality item.
4,Direct and to the Point,"This book is very informative in regards to the acquisition, care, maintenance, and everything else that is required of a sugar glider owner. Though its cover is definitely not to its advantage, the material contained within is very informative to a new or experienced owner. (Future owner maybe?) I use it as my primary source for information on my new sugar glider, Pikabu. Books like this definitely make owning an exotic pet as easy as taking care of a goldfish. :)"
5,Really is a great CD.,"I agree with the reviewer from LA: This CD is great and you won't regret the purchase. I was just listening to ""Flor De Lis"" on Djavan's latest live CD, Ao Vivo. This is one of the most upbeat tunes I've ever heard. I have no idea what the words are, nor does it matter, because the spirit of the song comes through loud and clear in upbeat, satisfying chords. Flor De Lis contains many great tunes. If you aren't familiar with Djavan's music, this is a great introduction. You won't be disappointed."
5,Changes American History,"This book, and the meticulous research that went into it, changes American history as we know it. No longer can we doubt that European explorers visited North America in the 14th century. Defying critics and skeptics, the authors dig deep into the history of the Kensington Rune Stone and--using a combination of hard science, historical research and common sense--conclusively prove that the stone slab is a genuine medieval artifact. Equally compelling are the insights the authors provide into the close-mindedness of many historians and archeologists who refuse to consider the possibility of pre-Columbian visitation to our shores. This book should be required reading in every history class in America."
3,"A complex story that was hard to follow, but enjoyable.","I had very mixed feelings when I began reading this book. It bothered me in a sense that I was only scratching the surface of the tue meaning of what the author had written. There always seemed to have a piece of emotion that I could not pick up on, and and only when we began to review the book in class did I begin to see the real struggle of Gene and Finny. I found the book to be very easy reading, just the symbolism and underlying themes hard to understand. The meaning of the bool has not become completely clear to me even now, and it just keeps throwing up more questions than it can answer. Overall I found the story enjoyable, and I like the challenges it brought up."
4,Discusses the conflict and it's impact on the story.,"John Knowles created an enjoyable novel in a Separate Peace. The novel contained two different conflicts that made it enjoyable. They were Gene vesus Finny and Academics Versus Athletics. The conflict between Gene and Finny dealt with Gene's jealousy of Finny's attributes. To me the characters Gene and Finny were developed well, which made the conflict easy to follow. Both possessed many characteristics of normal high school students. The Academiscs versus Athletics conflict interested me, since I personally live with that conflict each day. Both conflicts triggered my thuoghts about friendships and competition between friends. My opinion drifted from competition has no place between friends to competition can have a place in friendships. Overall I enjoyed A Separate Peace and recommend the novel to those who enjoy a thought provoking literary conflict."
3,A Seperate Peace Review,"I enjoyed reading and analyzing A Seperate Peace, by John Knowles. It was a book about a vacillating friendship between two teenage boys who faced conflicts between themselves, their fate, and each other. It is set in a boarding school in England called Devon High School. Knowles probably gets his writing ideas for the novel from his own high school experiences. It takes place during WWII, providing everyone at Devon with difficult decisions to make about their future. I recomed this book to anyone who enjoys reading moving stories about frienship and troubled adolescent years. It was a well written novel by Knowles which leaves you like you were going through the same conflicts as the characters. In conclusion, this book was a pleasure to read."
4,An Excellent Book About What Really Happens in the Mind,"This book is about friendship and its hardships. Gene, and intellectual, envies Phineas because of his athletic ability. Ironically, they are the best of friends. Unfortunately, their friendship becomes a roller coaster after an important event. Read A Separate Peace to find out what happens to their friendship. I think John Knowles wrote this book for adults. This book shows the redaer the effects of war. By reading A Separate Peace, they may want to work out their problems before taking action. Also, there are many people that the book refers to from World War II. Younger readers have probably never heard of these people. Even though there are these complications, this is an excellent book. I recommend it to people of all ages who know the struggles of friendship."
2,"Themes, yes; Fun to read, no","Books are supposed to be something you enjoy reading. ""A Separate Peace"" was not something I enjoyed reading. I am an 8th grade student in the Trenton, NJ area and this book is part of our English reading requirements. Not only did the students not enjoy reading this, but the teacher didn't either; I could tell. The book does teach valuble life themes, such as friendship, trust, revenge, etc., but it is not anything intersting, much less fun, to read. This book bored me out of my mind, but I really didn't have a choice whether I wanted to read it or not. If you're buying this book to read for pleasure, think before you spend the money."
1,Hey! the stars only go down to 1! I'd give it a -100!,"If you have not read this book, take advice from a trusted friend. DON'T DO IT! The book is so boring that I fell asleep just looking at the cover. Sometimes walking down the hall at school in my bag, it got to close and I collapsed on the floor. For crying out loud, my biology book is more exciting! If you have any mush in your head at all, DONT READ IT!"
3,Good.,"This book is about two boys who go throught the dilemma of one of the boys being crippled. This is about how the boy tries to live with himself and how he reflects on everything around him. I think that this book is not a humerous book but a book that is of real life dilemmas and how we try to get over our defeats. This book has some good points and some bad points. Some of its stronger points are the emotions in the book. This whole book is full of raw emotions of teenage boys. It takes the emotions of happiness, sadness, hate, jealousy, and forgiveness and makes them come alive in the characters. This is a very dramatic book. The book also has some bad points. The bad points throught this bookare how the book ends up and how they never really explained what happened on that limb that day. The bad points are how some things are resolved and how the characters deal with situations. These are some of the good and bad points throught A Seperate Peace."
1,a pathetic excuse,"I just finished reading this book for my sophomore honors English. I hated it. The book was well written and interesting, but depressing and sickeningly nostalgic. Gene is whiny and self centered, and hasn't changed a bit since the ""accident"". What a joke. John Knowles created a very likable, good character in Phineas, but you had better not get too attached to him. I'm awfully sick of disgusting ""classics"" such as this. Don't waste your time or money."
1,"Does not capture the attention of the reader. Yet, good plot","I found A Seperate Peace to be a well written novel with an excellent plot. However, Knowles fails to capture the attention of the reader. Knowles uses a lot of symbolism, but too little action. This creates an excellent novel for those with little else to read. I would prefer to read something a bit more interesting. I would recommend this novel for those who are looking for a well written novel with lots of symbolism and forshadowing."
4,What's a title?,I thought this book was interesting. I liked the way that it used flashbacks in order to tell the story. I am also glad that it placed the story while a real war was going on since there was a private war going on between two of the characters. It is a good book for anyone who has ever been envious of a friend.
2,"It was well written, but boring.","I think it was kind of boring, because it did not have much action in it. It was very dramatic. So if you like drama you might like it. I don't really like drama too much, so it wasn't one of my favorites. Although I thought it was very well wriiten and had many great themes. I also think it had great charachter development. I recommend it highly for those who like drama, but for those who like action try to avoid it."
4,"A Separate Peace gives wake up call to ""best friends"".","I thought John Knowles wrote A Separate Peace very well planned out. He weaved together symbolism so intricatelyin the book;it almost jumped out at me, but at the same time, seemed so smartly placed. Even though The book does not seem to contain a substantial amount of action, the subjective action does add up. John Knowles also constructed each character in the book almost highlighting each other. the scenery plays an imperative part of the book by carrying out symbolism and highlighting all of the important scenes in the book. this book contained one of the most interesting storylines in the world of books, and I recommend that everyone reads it."
4,a good book about friendship,"a seperate peace deals with two friends going to school during world war two.one is very athletic while the other one is not.the one that isnt,gets jealous in a way,and accidentally breaks his leg.they soon become enemies and deal with the troubles growing up.its a book about friendship and psychological problems."
1,A Separate Piece of $&*%,This is the perfect book to make boys hate reading forever. I was forced to read this in 8th grade and could not read another book for over 20 years. I hated everything about this book and seeing the cover again gave me the willies. I am not a big fan of book burning but I would buy a copy of this book if there was a good old fashioned book burning.
1,It's all CRAP!,It's me again from above. I decided the biology book comment was unfair. The biology book does not deserve to be classified as low as this book does. I am sorry for the mistake.
3,At some points it was good but other times it wasnt,When the tables started to turn and Gene could show off his strong qualities was a part that i could get into but otherwise the book just trailed off. It had a good use of varities in symbolism and that was another strong factor. I didnt realy understand the importance of some characters so I gave it 3 stars.
3,A Seperate Piece,"A Seperate Piece is a great book, based on two friends during a time where friendships were tough. The book is during WWII. This book shows the positive and negative sides about a friendship. It allows you to see how bets friends can still have flaws. This shows the jealousy and envy of one friend, to the point where he accidentely kills his best friend. All in all I liked the way John Knowles shows both the good and bad side of friendships."
4,A realistic presentation of life!,"It was difficult to interpret at times, but captures the ambiance of the pre-war and war era. This novel makes one appreciate the deep impact friendship can have. Phineas was incredibly unique but believable by the reader. In any case, the pink shirt was hilarious!"
3,A Seperate Peace is good book,"The book A Seperate Peace wasn't the best book I've read, but it was interesting. It is the story of two adolescent boys in the time of World War II. The focus of the book is set on the battles fought within the minds of the boys, not the ones on the battlefield. The main theme of this story os jealousy because even though Gene and Phineas were best friends, Gene has a hard time dealing with Phineas' ""perfectness."" Throughout the book there are more slow, boring parts thatn there are exciting, but when there were good parts in the I couldn't help but quicken my reading pace. The biggest dissapointment of A Seperate Peace was the ending, which was very surprising."
4,review #5719,"I also had to read A Separate Peace for my english class. Is it just me, or does anyone else notice a trend here? Anyway, I thought I was reading the most boring book ever published, but it turned out all right in the end. I admit that it wasn't the greatest book I ever read, but it was still well written and all that other ""good stuff."" Hopefully, people who are forced to read this novel don't take it the way I did, I wouldn't blame you if you still did, but still make an attempt to realize that it isn't at all as bad as it may seem."
3,A Separate Peace,I read A Separate Peace for my english class. The book started off interesting but as it continued it seemed to get less interesting. There were some good parts in the book such as when Gene goes to vist Leper at his home in Vermont after his discharge. Also when Gene has his accident with Finny. I would not recommend this book for people to read unless they enjoy books that seem to go on forever.
2,A boring all talk book.,"It really bit hard, the best action in the book was when Finny fell out of the tree. If you are an emotional women who wants to cry or have someone to feel sorry for, then this is a good book but if you are a guy who likes action and hates to fall asleep while reading, than this book, like I said, ""Really bites hard."""
2,"I did not enjoy this at all, I read it for school.","I can honestly say that I strongly disliked this book, but it still wasn't a full-on hate. This was a required read for English this year and I suffered through this book for a long 2 weeks. The first 4 or five chapters were very boring and slow with only a few exciting sentences. I prayed every few pages that the book would get inriguing soon, but it never happened! To me the most exciting part was when Gene got the telegram from Bobby stating that Leper had run away from the army. Something that really annoyed me with this book was how Gene had this creepy obsession with Finny and followed what ever he said. Gene had NO personality whatsoever so it just added to the dullness of the book. I did however like the theme of the novel. I would not recommend this book to anybody unless you are most uninteresting person I know."
2,uhh,"This book was not very good. I do not understand why Gene would try and turn a great friendship into some kind of war. Finny never knew that Gene even felt that way. Finny did not feel that way towards Gene at all. Even when Gene confessed to hurting Finny on purpose because of jealousy, Finny refused to believe. I do not like this book because it does not symbolize what a real friendship should be like. I understand that everyone was going through hard times because of the war, but friends should stay close during hard times. They should not turn against each other. This was a bad thing that Gene could do to his best friend."
2,a seperate peace,"this book arrived in the amount of time specified, but the condition is terrible. the condition was supposed to be fair/good, but the corners are bent, some of the pages bent and/or discolored. the book appears to be very old and not very well cared for. have not yet read the book, so can't actually rate the book, only the seller."
1,Oh My Gosh,"I can't believe I have to give it any stars!! I hated this book! It's definately one of the worst (if not THE worst) book I've ever read. It was so boring!! I had to read it for class and I didn't because it was so horrible...If you ever have to read it for a class, trust me and FIND CLIFF NOTES!!!"
5,Coming of Age,"Probably one of the best ""assigned reading"" books I wound up reading in school. A gem of a book I never would have discovered on my own as my normal reading habits back then were King and Koontz. A big thank you to my teachers for exposing me to this wonderful tale of friendship and betrayal."
4,A great book for many,"I read this book in November 1998. I picked it up for an English class, and didn't ever think of finishing it. Until I read the first couple of chapters. John Knowles got you involved with the book right from the start. By the end I was not confused with any of it. Seriously I didn't think this would be a book that would interest me, because I'm not into wars and history, but this was different. It was a sad but good ending, that I really didn't understand, because I thought it was dumb, but overall, it was great."
3,Worth reading,"Although the book is not a ""page turner,"" it does give a valuable message. It is clearly not the best book you will ever come upon, but it is worth the read."
3,A Seperate Peace,"This book is not one of the best ones that I have read, but it is good. For one, I liked Finny's spontaneous personality, and how he held true to that personality, even after his tragedy. What I don't understand about the book is why Gene did some of the things that he did to his friend. For a good part of the book, he goes on thinking that Finny is jealous of him, then when he realizes that he never was jealous, he purposely makes Finny fall.The end of the book also ends rather abruptly. It seemed as if Knowles just got tired of writing. It's not very beleaveable, nor did it wrap up the story for me. It just ran down a cliff.Other than those few bad sides, the story overall was quite good. It was very inventive, and throughout the book, I had a sense that there really was a war going on. I'd recommend this to anyone who like historical fiction and is willing to think a little about why the characters do what they do."
4,"""Separate"" but not Equal","After completing this novel, I found this novel a captivating classic. The plot was fairly engaging and the characters were well developed but the story ended rather abruptly which was my only complaint. Finny and Gene as classic characters with distinct personalities. Gene is an intellectual and Finny is an awesome athlete; they are best of friends at a private prep school. The setting of Devon School makes the book comparible to my student life. I think everyone can appreciate the plot, which has a surprising twist. The story is interesting from the beginning. I suggest this book to anyone who likes ralistic fiction or war novels from different prospectives. This book is definitely not the same old stuff."
5,"Thank you, Amazon!","I bought this for my son for school. He needed a paper copy, not an ebook. Like many 17 year-olds, getting a book was not high in the priority list, so it was last minute. Your shipping policy is so good that we got it quickly just by using standard shipping. You saved his grade : ) And, as a bonus, he really did enjoy the book. Thanks, Amazon, for your consistently great customer service."
4,Seems good,"I used this with my 1yr old Lab - the duck scent seems to work well. Have the Pheasant scent to use as well, but haven't tried it yet."
3,Decent sprayer,"It works okay, the spout mixes the solution well enough. However the spout is a bit short and hard to hold the sprayer with the hose attached."
2,Not the highest quality or even high,"Product was a bit of a disappointment. But the price should have been the red flag. There were cheaper ones so I thought this would be sturdier. In our summers this plastic dried out pretty quickly and had an ""economic"" feel to it. Did not work well with miracle gro."
5,The Very Best of Harlan...,"Troublemakers is the best introduction to the stories of Harlan Ellison in print. Out of the roughly 2,000 stories he has written, some of his greatest are here, including Soldier, Jeffty is Five, and ""Repent, Harlequin!"" Said the Ticktockman. Each story comes with a little preface by the author, wherein he loosely ties them all together with the theme of ""troublemaking."" (In actuality, this is a ""greatest hits"" collection.) However, this by no means contains ALL of his greatest hits. For instance, The Whimper of Whipped Dogs is absent, as is Demon with a Glass Hand. For something along those lines you'd need to purchase The Essential Ellison - and only Harlan could get away with calling a book the size of the Norton Anthology ""essential."" However, to begin a study of his work, this is the place to start."
5,Love the Essays!,"Yes, this is a collection of Ellison's stories that have been published many times over. However, the short essays that precede each story are worth the price alone, in my opinion (My personal favorite is the ""Soldier"" preamble, and I feel this story is very relevant to what's going on today).I admit a certain prejudice to Harlan Ellison's work: My mother introduced me to his books early on, and at difficult times in my life it was good to hear another articulate the anger I felt. Got me through many a sleepless night! Plus, in one of his stories there is a character that has our family name (not a common one). So...Take my review with a grain of (rock)salt if you will, but read at least one of his stories if you haven't already.I would say that this book is a good intro to Harlan Ellison's work."
2,Kind of boring on the small screen,"I watched this with friends who swore the film shines of the big screen. It just seemed boring, repetitive and the music was just OK. The acting was hilariously, painfully bad at times. I think it could be engrossing on the big screen, but only if you are hard core into traditional Bollywood films."
2,Wee bit of a let down,This movie was a wee bit of a let down.The subject matter was your typical Hindi movie and included subjects which most Hindi movies choose to stay away from - whores and charlitans.I was disappointed with Shah Rukh Kahn as he was intoxicated most of the movie.A movie to say 'I've seen' but not one I would recommend to others.
3,poor quality,"I'm sorry to say I both the dvd because of all the collourfull cloth and settings ,but the quality is better on Youtube HD than the dvd itself."
1,ugh,"I've seen many films from all over the world including Bollywood but ""Devdas"" is in a class by itself as the most boring pretentious over -produced badly acted by any standards, so that even as self parody its ghastly - without subtlety or the rapturous extravagance one can enjoy in Bollywood films. Its two hours too long and the leads have the emptiest faces likely to be seen on the screen."
3,average and predictable,"This is just an ok movie. It won't make my top ten list of Bollywood films. It has some good things- the sets are opulent, the clothes are gorgeous, the acting was very good. I got it because I have become a fan of Ashryan Khan and he doesn't disappoint.The dancing is an old fashion style, not the hip hop style dancing in most modern holly films. To me they are mostly borng ad are the songs. I also thought the plot is predictable, the emotions are overwrought and everything is melodramatic.If you want a better movie see Billu."
3,Nice try,"I give this book three stars simply because the plight of the sea turtles is a story that needs telling and retelling until the public is educated and the creatures are brought away from the edge of extinction.On the downside, this novel, put out by a small science publisher out of Malabar, FL, could've used better editing. The text is filled with small grammatical errors (like pluralizing the Kemp's ridley sea turtle as ""ridley's"") that detract from the largely entertaining storyline. Otherwise, the sophomore effort by author/veterinarian Greg Lewbart is not nearly as polished as Florida thrillers penned by the likes of Hiaasen, McDonald, etc., and the factual background of the tale draws too heavily, even clumsily, from its primary source, the writings of Dr. Archie Carr.That aside, the heart and devotion with which Lewbart writes is readily apparent, and his protagonist, Hal Noble, is a likable hero in Everyman's clothing. A laudable effort."
4,my second pair,I found these at K&G; about 4 years ago and loved them. The shoes are a bit stiff at first but break in after about 10 wears or so. I love them because I can wear them at work in the business attire setting but also pair them with a suit and they look great either way. They definitely fit a formal and a semi formal setting great. As far as appearance they are a classy looking shoe without looking pretentious or ostentatious.I would give them 5 stars except for one thing. They scuff relatively easy and the beautiful brown color gives way to a lighter more tan color. For me personally I like the look of slight wear in the shoes but some may not.These are sturdy shoes. I wore them about 2-3x's per week over a four year period for work and then occasionally for more formal affairs and it was about four to five years before the soles started to separate from the rest of the shoe. I immediately came on amazon and bought another pair
2,Nice looking rubber hose but kinks like crazy,I have had black rubber hoses from other manufacturers that were stiff but flexible and resisted kinking. This hose is definately not one of those. Although the description describes it as having a thick and durable wall it is not very stiff at all. In the first few minutes of using it about 10 kinks developed that totally stopped all water flow. You need to carefully lay out the hose before use and watch constantly that you don't twist it since kinks form with the least provocation. All in all I wish that I had bought another Craftsman brand black rubber hose that I have for the front of my house since that almost never kinks.
3,FRONT YARD HOSE,It is more difficult to roll back on the stand than my previous hose. So that is a significant disappointment. I am surprised that it kinks so often!
3,copyright 1894^H^H^H994.,"This book has all the details of doing digital audio, starting with banging two rocks together to start a fire, and quickly progressing to the development of western civilization. ... ok, it's not *quite* that bad. But there is precious little relevant information to any modern project. When your car's mp3 player is running Linux, who cares that Gray codes are the way to go for digital tape positioning? Who needs to be told that you might want to think about doing a calculation in RAM instead of with discrete digital components? There's a good chapter on ""advanced digital audio processing"". And it explains basic things about dithering, mixing, gain control, etc. But on the whole this book is very geared toward antiquated hardware, rather than presenting theories or algorithms that are relevant to all digital systems. I guess that's why it's the ""art"" and not the principles of digital audio. In the index you will find ""cylinder transducer"", but not ""pitch"" or ""tempo""."
4,Nice but no holes in sign,"Boxer sign made from good plastic, it didnt have holes as an item description, boxer figure is a well attached sticker, good product"
2,Not that great. For die hards only.,"A whole lot of post Martin Turner/Ted Turner material. Too much, actually, to be an accurate representation of the whole of WA's material. Some ok interviews, but this is definitly only for hardcore WA fans. Casual fans may find themselves yawning thru much of this."
1,Not downloading,When i am trying to buy this product it is showing a message of some geographical restriciton. Kindly advise how can i buy it.ThanksFozan
5,A chip off the ole (?),"I am one for the unusual. Scarry movies don't scare me unless they are the calibur of 'Straw Dogs'? (it came close to scarring the _hit outta me). I loved the weird come-off's; the guy asking the lil boy if he had told his step-father that 'he was a piece of _hit'. . and everything 'ring-dang-doo'. My son from the Air Force knew that I would love this movie and rented it for me. I BOUGHT MY OWN ON DVD. I am one who thinks that ""The Three Amigo's"" was anything BUT a 1986 box office flop. . .(of course, I like music, western's, air planes, singing horses, bar scene. . MUST I GO ON!!!!!)"
4,a funny film,a good film with an actress very fun alyssa milanoi loved alyssa milano in this role.I recommend it
2,Boring,Very boring movie..no plot or anything. Hard to believe there were some big name actors and actresses in it. What were they thinking? Love Alyssa Milano...but hate this movie.
5,Best original story since last Downey movie.,"Once again Robert Downey Sr. comes out with a original movie. You dont see this, in many directors any more. This movie is so simple yet with each of it's strange characters, the movie turns out to be not just about a pool cleaner, but about a drug addict, a man with ALS, a gambling mother, a angry mobster. All these great characters would not normaly fit in a movie together but Downey some how made it happen. Sean Penn and Malcolm Mcdowell are great. It will make you smile."
5,The last great book by Og Mandino.,"Over the last quarter of a century, I have shared The God Memorandum with at least a thousand people...and I still do. Something happened to Og's writing after this book, and although I have bought and read almost all of his other books, this one and ""The Greatest Salesman"" are the only two (his first two) in which Og doesn't either spend most of the book in self-promotion and typical Jesus-Jerk preaching. This one I highly recommend to all who need a good shove, a good message, or a good cry."
1,"Good, but was it Really?",I enjoyed the book very much until I read the letter in Chap. VIII. It mentions an amulet. An amulet is of the occult.This disturbed me very much.
2,an average self-help book,"It's a good book - but I was disappointed with all the self-promotion going in the book. The book becomes repetitive as Simon praises Mr. Og over and over again. Nonetheless, it has a lot of inspiring messages - but I would rate it overall as only mediocre."
5,A little goodie,A book I like to refer to when I'm down. A little odd but fun and feels good once you get into it.I've given as a gift and recommend to friends.
3,Good training tool,"My sons have been playing ball for years and I have been coaching for the past 12 years. this has been a great training tool for my boys as well as my teams. I am now coaching H.S.varsity baseball and am still using the Hit-A-Way today. Durability with the older boys is an issue, the product fails rather quickly. It held up fine for the younger kids."
1,Please do not waste your money,"First let me say I am a HUGE fan of the OLD hit a way. This new one is basically worthless. The ad says you can use it on a pole, where this is true it does not specify that the pole must be 2 inches or smaller in diameter. How many poles do you find that size? Pretty much zero. It WILL NOT fit around your typical basketball pole as they are 4 inches or bigger.The strap is long enough, but the velcro is not long enough for it to secure around a larger pole thus making it worthless.I think the design is so that you are forced to buy their pole to use the item. If you notice in the picture of their pole it is a small diameter item.What once used to be great is not worthless, Unless of course you want to go out and spend more money buying their pole and equipment to use it.Don't waste your money."
4,Good product if you use it right,Good for adult use. I got used to it in about five minutes. I did notice that the ball began to wear out after one day of use. Maybe they could make one that could take the abuse from frequent hard hits. Overall I am happy and I hope it lasts me a while. Those that complain about the ball coming back to slowly may not be hitting it hard enough.
1,Tediously unexciting,"I have never had a relationship with a woman and bought this book, hoping that it will teach me how to form a healthy relationship with ""female"" spirits. Was I disappointed! The practices contained in this book can only bring more unwanted attention into your life, making you more miserable. It's a tedious read that is not for the beginner. I should have spent my money buying yet another dating manual for attracting a living female. If only attracting loving astral lovers is as easy as Hollywood and TV make it out to be!"

3,good... but not for younger ones,This is a good video except for one unforseen problem. The first story revolves around a character who is behaving very badly in her whole attitude. Eventually Brambleberry fairy learns her lesson but she have a lot of sassy dialog in the mean time. Unfortunately this bad tempered mouthy little girl is the one my daughter has decided to model and now when she mad she recites these tantrums back at me word for word. So we don't watch this anymore. She does like them though. I'm sorry to have had to take them away. She is 3 years old.The second story is good. Cheesy but good.
4,"Not one of the best, but still entertains","This DVD contains two episodes [for a total running time of 45 mins]. In ""When the Berry Fairy Came to Stay"", Strawberry finds an injured fairy, Margalo B Berry Glow in her garden, but later the fairy takes advantage of Strawberry's generosity. In ""The Legend of Sherry Bubble Berry"", Strawberry lends a helping hand to a klutzy fairy who is on a special mission for the fairy queen. This particular instalment in the Strawberry Shortcake series was not one of my favorites, or my preschooler's, but it is still worth watching."
5,Great Video,"I have a collection of videos and DVD's by Dr. Jwing-Ming Yang and I enjoy all of them greatly. I have a collection of books on Chi Kung, and among them those with deal with Eight Pieces of Brocade, but much prefer to practice while watching the video. The exercises are gentle yet powerful, improving the flow of energy in your body, and making you feel better, healthier and even more energized day by day."
3,"Okay, but a little dated.","I own this in the VHS version that is quite a few years older. This is nice because you get some interviews with the elusive Blackmore, and there iw a nice version of ""Hush."" However, they all take themselves a littel too seriously, and to hear Joe Lynn Turner talk about making his own footsteps in the group, (He was fired after only one album and tour) is in retrospect, rather funny.There are some nice clips on this, but you can get more on the Machine Head DVD which catches a lot more of the creative process and does, in fact, have better footage.A nice primer on Deep Purple, but nothing outstanding."
5,"An MGB owners ""must have"" manual.","This guide is an overview of the day-to-day things that an average MGB owner needs to be aware of to properly maintain their vehicle.

1,I guess it's a matter of opinion...,"The plot really was a good idea and the hero of the story was wonderful, BUT (you knew a but was coming) I really did not like the fact that Patience was totally obsessed with another man until the last few pages of the book. I would have loved to have seen Patience and Richard's relationship develop, but I was left with the feeling that the end of the book was only the barest of beginnings of their romance. Most of the time I was reading this book, I was longing to hit Patience over the head for ignoring the man who was so desperately in love with her.The last straw for me was the scene (which was a tad much for a regency romance) where Patience came close to losing her virginity to her childhood crush, Pip. It was too detailed, if you get what I mean, and it was close to the end of the book, which made it worse some how.This book gets one star for poor Richard. Elisabeth Fairchild has written much better..."
4,The Ongoing Debate,"I purchased this book for my ""Formation of Modern Christianity"" class and am in the process of writing my term paper on the debate between Erasmus and Luther on the issue of free will. This book does an excellent job of reviewing Erasmus' case for free will and briefly summarizes Luther's case for the bondage of will, as well. Buy this book if you'd like a concise review of this ongoing debate."
3,Somewhat of a Disappoinment...,"This music is somewhat bland and sounds like background music for a documentary. I also find the booming deep base drum to be a bit anoying... it is mixed much too loud relative to the other instruments. In general I would have to say that I've found many better CD's for $3-4, and paying over $10 for this one is not a good value for my money. I won't play it very much, and I certainly will not buy anything more by Karunesh."
4,A Look At Growing Up As a Christian Scientist,"This book is the best I have read so far on the Christian Scientist religion. I have not finished the book yet. I find it painful to read about all the lives that were harmed, so I have to put it down for a while and then go back. There are many writings about Mary Baker Eddy and the beliefs that she influenced people to embrace. My mother's family members were Christian Scientists. My mother became seriously ill and went to a doctor. She could never have contact with her mother again and rarely mentioned the religion or her mother. Everything was always so secretive. I want to read more about the women who succombed to this religion -- about their personalities, marriages, and ways of raising children. I haven't found anything that focuses on just that or that answers my questions about the pain I know she endured."
3,Size?,"The product information says it comes in medium and large, but there is no option to select size or know which size this is."
1,Excited about the book but am DISGUSTED with the shape of the book!,"I open my mailbox and say ""Oh Yes, the book is here!"" Unfortunately, i bought a new copy and got a book that looks like it should be in the TRASH! What company sells books ""NEW"" in this type of condition?!?! I will NEVER EVER buy from you again nor should anyone else! GOOD DAY"
4,If a runner you will like,I enjoyed this book a lot. I don't think the casual jogger will enjoy it but if you competed in track at all in your life then you should enjoy this book. The book goes by kind of fast but still enjoyable.
5,leave it to logo,"leave it to the logo network to get this dude some well deserved attention. he deserves a close look... ""flow"" is off the hook... deep in soul blended well with a soft rap beat that hits the spot. great mood music. trust me."
4,Exellent on Blu,"Let me just say that if you have the high def television, the killer sound system, and a high def. connection then I am legend on blu-ray is the only way to go. You get all the extras from the 2 disc dvd and the picture is absolutely SPECTACULAR!! The best picture quality I have seen yet on any blu ray. Its worth a buy."
4,sci-fi at its best,"Amazing and very entertaining movie. thrilling movie. great sci-fi. A future which is not unlikely, if not mankind threads more gently."
2,Didn't Do It For Me,"Love Will Smith but....this just wasn't my cup of coffee. It lacked depth. At least the ""infecteds"" were not as gory looking as I had anticipated."
1,"DVD unplayable, damaged HD-DVD player","Fresh out of the package, never before played, this HD-DVD pixeleated, skipped and threw my HD-DVD player into an error code and worse yet my HD-DVD player became locled and unrespondant.NOT Satisied."
2,100 Mins of my life I will never get back,"This movie was horrible. The action did not pick up until what seemed like 2 hours later. I am a fan of Will Smith and he acted well but the movie was horrible. When it was over, I said ""that was an hour and a half of my life I will never get back"". The only reason I gave it 2 stars vs 1 was for the special effects/CGI."
2,"One of the few times I cheer for the ""zombies""","I Am Legend (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)I was unpleasantly surprised to find this movie to be nothing more than a very shallow rip-off of the 1970's classic ""Omega-Man"" starring Charleton Heston. So little was changed, in fact, that it rapidly becomes a tedious embarrassment. I understand that few quality screenplays are being produced nowdays, but I still loath cheap reproductions of modern classics. ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" starring Donald Sutherland was another movie that was recent re-made into a poor quality clone. My point is, why bother? Rent the earlier versions and judge them yourselves. I don't need to spend the money in theater, nor on DVD to enshrine the sad newest rip-off versions....Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, but his starring in ""Omega Man ReVisited"" does little to rescue this movie."
4,Check the Alt Endings,I didn't get to see the movie in the theater mostly b/c I heard mixed reviews.So I bought the movie b/c of curiousity which turned out to be a good buy. Blu-ray disk comes with two versions: theater and Alternate version both are good movies but take the movie thru two completely different paths which made the purchase worthwhile. I prefered the Alt ending but my wife liked the Theater vers.If you like Will Smith movies and a mild thrillers buy it.
3,I am Legend,"It's a great movie by Will Smith. It's kinda acting test for Will, though the ending is not too great."
2,To be Ignored,"If you want to watch a post-apocalyptic film, watch On the Beach. Or if you insist on action, watch one of the Mel Gibson Road Warriors. if you want energetic medical life-saving teams, watch Morgan Freeman in Outbreak. We like Will Smith a lot, but even he can't save this terminally awful special effects film."
2,"I really wanted to like it, but...","it was just SO depressing! I am a big fan of Will Smith and will watch anything he's in-- but if I never have to see this movie again it will be too soon! There is just one sad event after another and really there are no ""feel good"" moments at all. I felt like I wanted to hang myself while watching the movie-- not really, but that's just how depressing it was to watch. Props to Will Smith on an amazing performance-- the only good thing about the movie, taking out all other content.Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this movie..."
1,Watch the Omega Man instead,"The only thing this film has in common with book it's based on is the title. Moving the location from Southern California to New York can be forgiven, but turning the mutated population into mindless animals is unforgivable. Read the book, watch the Omega Man (which this is actual closer to), check late night TV for an airing of ""The Last Man on Earth"" with Vincent Price, but stay away from this butchering of a Science Fiction tale."
2,But For Willl Smith Very Disappointing,A semi interesting Movie thats somewhat depressing and boring until bam the ending happens.Really not very interesting until the contrived ending.Nobody is in New York City except Rabid Humans and Will Smith and his Dog until much later someone hears his radio and one human comes to save the planet.Seem simple doesn't it ? It was .
1,Sorry Will........................................,This movie SUCKED from about 20 minutes into it! Went DOWNHILL fast after the dog died. We almost walked out of the theater. Really! I have always loved Will Smith and he won't let you down as far as acting goes. The plot is sooooooooooooo unorigional I could have BARFED! Don't waste your $ on this one!
2,Get the single disc version,"Get the single disc, most of the extras on the two disc are only viewable on a Windows PC via the internet and are only ""valid"" till March 2009 - i.e. they'll expire and won't be hosted on the web after that! 2 Disc = Rip Off. While I enjoyed the movie, I was expecting to have the normal two disc extras available on the 2nd DVD to watch on my DVD player. Well, the only thing on the 2nd DVD is an alternate ending to the movie. All of the good extras (how it was produced etc.), are only viewable (not save-able) on a Windows Computer (uses MS specific stuff) that you hook to WarnerBros through the internet and will only be available through March of 2009, at that point those extras go poof and you won't be able access them - nice. I wouldn't have bought the two disc version for just the alt ending and having the extras not viewable on my TV and then expire in less than a year."
2,Mediocre,"All in all, I Am Legend is even a disappointment if one went in expecting disappointment. There is no deeper examination of loneliness, just shots of aloneness. The threat to Neville has been dumbed down- in earlier versions he is the threat. In this film, he is the threatened. The female he meets is a religious bubblehead, rather than a plant from the semi-zomboids that are looking to start a New Breed. And on and on goes the watering down. The film fails as both an adaptation, and if seen without knowledge of its forebears. But, aside from its Hollywoodization stripping the tale of its relevance and depth, this film version even fails its low Hollywoodized standards of success- it's dull, poorly made, and has not a second of suspense. It is a retard's retard. But, as I always seek to give credit where it's due, let me state to that grandfather of Hollywood dumbing down, `Thanks for nothing, Mr. Spielberg!'"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:Everything with Will Smith fighting loneliness by himself in New York City is worth watching and everything with Will Smith fighting poorly-CGIed zom-pires is worth fastforwarding--throw in some heavy-handed religiosity and you've got a mixed bag of a film that should be approached with caution.
4,Omega Man remake,This is a fair remake of the great Charlton Heston movie.. Omega Man..First 3/4 of movie was good... Last 1/4 was weak...Mr Smith's acting was fair to good....
5,"Smith, a force to be reckoned with","This movie is awesome. I never read the book, I heard it doesn't follow the book too closely but who cared its a sick movie either way. Will Smith at just about his best. Man has this guy come a long way from the Fresh Prince, not to mention Willenium. He is an awesome actor, does a great job in this movie and the movie is filled with excitement. Lots of shock value and unexpected. Loved it. Only regret is that the movie ends a little quick, for such a big budget film it does not follow the recent trend of epic movie means epic length film. In this case the movie would be better a little bit longer but either way I loved it. Hope you do too."
2,Average Film,"This wasn't a very detailed film. I liked it but was glad I saw it on cable and didn't pay the regular movie price or I would have felt cheated. Also, his blatant advertising of Shrek in this movie was a little nauseating. Smith shouldn't taint a good film with a mediocre one. Don't bother buying I Legend. See it on cable or order it though internet library loan at your local library if it doesn't have it on the shelf. Will Smith dropped it with this film."
4,great but if you really want to think...,Loved it. You could really feel the sense of loss when Neville has to do the unthinkable to his most loved companion. But for a similar movie that will haunt your mind for days pick up The Quiet Earth.
3,Standard end-of-world cliches,"I did like the digital scenes of an eerily empty and decaying NYC, although how many movies have employed this same device? Everything from the ""War of the Worlds"" to ""Planet of the Apes"" etc etc. The monsters are quite routine looking, as well. But why are the streets conveniently empty of vehicles so that Will Smith can go speeding down them anywhere he feels like it? And why does he risk taking his dog out with him when he knows the dog is not immune to the killer virus? So, we can have our emotions tugged later on, perhaps? As doomsday movies go, this one isn't too bad. It's just a bit rehashed, though it's based on a book I haven't read, so I don't know how good a job was done on the adaptation. Watchable when you get a moment, but not something you will want to see again, possibly."
3,Decent,"I admit that I was tense and on the edge of my seat during this movie. I think it helps that I never read the novel or watched the movies that this story is based on. The computer effects of the Dark Seekers and the animals are not lifelike which annoys me. I liked the beginning when Robert is just trying to survive with his dog, Sam. Will Smith did a good job showing his desperation during his three-year isolation. All in all, the movie is predictable. The extras are subtitled."
3,Some Day This Story Will Be Told,"Richard Matheson's book has a 'hook' that has never been exploited in any adaptaptation (although the Vincent Price version is the closest) and that is the variation on the 'One-Eyed Man in the country of the blind...'The Vampires have taken over - there is no cureAccept it - they haveAnd that's the point. When you are the only odd one in a world that has been turned topsy turvey - night is day and day is night - then you are the monster and the monsters are normal. Civilization continues in the hours of darkness, and mankind somehow adapts. It is perfectly logical that they would try to destroy the creature that's killing them while they sleep, and that they would fear him. Neville's final words in the book ""I am anaethema - I am legend."" sums it all up. When mutation is normality - the normal man is a monster to be feared and destroyed.Someday, some screewriter and director will figure this out and tell Matheson's story.This isn't it."
4,"Great story, Dated CGI","Will Smith delivers another performance so powerful that you can't help but stare in awe before you realize that you are crying.The story was taken from Vincent Price's ""The Last Man on Earth"" which was later redone very popular with Charlton Heston in ""Omega Man."" All 3 films are worth watching, but ""I am Legend"" changes the story in some powerful ways.The initial CGI for NY city is amazing. The digital craftsmanship is phenomenal.Unfortunately the CGI that is front and center in the movie is painfully inadequate (especially on Blu Ray). Basically all living creatures were done poorly. They feel cartoony.So, as long as you go in with the proper expectations about CGI, you can focus on the amazing story telling, plot, and acting."
3,Different Ending?,"I love this movie, so I rented it on amazon instant video and watched it with my daughter. Great...until the end! That's not how it ends!!"
4,"I liked it, but my husband didn't","The movie starts out with Will Smith seemingly the only person left after a few clips throughout the film show piece by piece what got him there. Everything is bright and sunny, with him riding around an isolated NYC with his dog. After a while though, his alarm on his watch starts going off, and he heads home, while the dark starts creeping up he gets in and closes off his house, windows and all. You then hear horrible, demonish sounds outside. You get it that this is a nightly routine for him. You do get a couple of great scenes that are scary in this, but the movie really plays up on his sense of isolation and aloneness. I think the reason my husband didn't like it was because of the time it took to get established. I don't think the story would have worked had he just all of a sudden started with the monsters, it had to tell what his life was to that point, and how it started to change. Anyway, pretty good movie if you feel like seeing one!"
1,digital copy expired,"Decent boxed set with good extras, but the digital copy is expired...how lame is that? WB sucks!"
4,Will Smith makes Legend,"This movie was great in its own context. It started out with, what I'll admit, were some slightly cheesy computer imagery of a desolate downtown NYC with Will Smith chasing a herd of deer through the abandoned streets. The CGI hemocytes (vampire people), were well done, but I'll agree with a few other reviewers that they could have been done differently and it would have had a greater effect. (without spoiling anything) Robert Neville is a colonel in the army who was charged with extinguishing the great viral outbreak that destroyed Earth's population. He decides to stay at what he calls ""ground zero"", b/c he truly believes that he can ""fix this"". In its own context, this is a very good movie, and definitely worth watching."
3,"Great premiste, CGI sucks","Will Smith is a very good actor. The special effects and acting in this movie are first-rate. The CGI ruined it for me. Compare this movie with ""28 Days"", which had human actors, and which is far scarier. All I kept thinking of was the CGI and that is not good. Someone compared it to the mummies in ""The Mummy"". Exactly. And for the same reason, I can't really recommend it."
1,boring movie.,"I don't know why I bought this. I'm sick and tired of zombies, well, sick and tired of hipster zombies. I'd stick with Chuck Heston's ""Omega Man"" if I want to watch something like this."
4,Legend,"I enjoyed this movie, even though it was depressing at the end. It revealed a more serious side of Will Smith.Worth buying!"
5,Edge of my seat...,"Having seen the original ""Last Man on Earth,"" and the ""Omega Man"" I wasn't sure what to expect and so set up no expectations. Will Smith did a great job and with a few twists and turns different from the originals this movie was well done and had me on the edge of my seat throughout and right up to the end. Well worth my time."
4,"Good story - not like novel, but adequate and engrossing","Will Smith was very good in this movie and I enjoyed this interpretation of the novel. Nothing is ever as good as the book, however."
2,You must be kidding..,"A movie this limp and nonessential gets THIS type of ""star"" treatment? You can stuff a huge box with as many discs and extras as you want but it doesn't make the movie any better. I Am Legend is simply ""meh"" no matter what type of spiffy box art is designed for it. Definite PASS on this one."
2,Human civilization collapses,"The premise of the movie is so disturbing, that I didn't really enjoy or appreciate the rest of the movie. Civilization as we know it collapses, all the animals too. Human culture, history is gone within 3 years. May it never happen. I feel the flashback technique that is used to tell parts of the story, failed to drive my interest. It should have been used more sparingly - Batman begins, Pirates of the Caribbean 3 are two examples where too many flashbacks only broke the continuity of their story lines. In Equilibrium, a brilliant movie, flashbacks were used more effectively to intensify dramatic moments. Overall, what I found disturbing about the movie is the fact that we learn little about the rest of the world, the US, commercial NY alone seems of interest to the movie makers, a thin story line wrapped in a cheap budget."
3,Dissapointed!,"the movie is great, the packaging is great, and the edition is real great, just for my collection... but im dissapointed with amazon, because in the specifications it says ""Spanish Subtitles""... and it has not, that subs, and i talked 2 month ago with a customer from amazon, and he told me that they would change the details just for another people read before purchase, and i look now and its the same, keep saying this :Language: EnglishSubtitles: English, French, SpanishAnyway thank you for the box set"
5,Robinson and girl Friday,"I notice I was in a mellow mood when I watched this movie in a Singapore cinema. I focus entirely on the good sides of this entertaining movie and ignore other aspects.The good sides:Girls get to watch Will Smith a lot (which made my daughters happy, hence me).The variation on Robinson Crusoe is fascinating, even if Friday doesn't make it as long as Crusoe.Optimal use is made of Bob Marley's music.Suspense is very strong in some scenes, mainly the hunt into the dark building (a variation on Silence of the Lambs, with different, though similar monsters).An interesting variation on the 'apocalypse caused by science' theme.A marvellous opening scene with Thompson, happily and modestly admitting that she conquered cancer. One does not need to be anti-science to appreciate this gem.The monsters, well, they were also there, as was the future, in the person of the girl from Sao Paolo who never heard of Bob Marley."
2,Good Acting Poor Writing & Directing with lots of Overblown hyperbole,"Ok I just saw I AM LEGEND starring Will Smith. I found it to be tedious, time-consuming, poorly written, largely unexplained & just plain silly. Most of the movie was spent just showing how along Will Smith was in New York. That was cool for about 5 minutes, then it just got silly. The only saving grace of this film is Will Smith's performance, which was really good. He is a very talented actor, but the poor writing & lackluster direction show once again that even the most brillian actors need good writing etc. The ending was too convenient. All of a sudden 2 more uninfected people just happen to show up & they know of a colony in Vermont. Quite honestly the entire story could have been told in about 30 minutes, plus the director tried to use cheap scare tactics instead of suspence which was also not cool. OVerall not the worst movie I've ever seen but certainly nowhere near the best."
1,Only Recieved 2 of 3 blue ray disk in package.,Only two of the three Blue Ray Disk in the package. Returning item. Looks like it was repackaged or something. Little disappointed on it.
1,Worse Will Smith movie ever!,Thank God he gets killed at the end so there'll be no sequel!Watch the Omega Man with Charlton Heston instead.
1,Terrible,"This is the worst movie I have seen in long time. The effects are fake and the plot didn't make sense. It jumped from future to present so many times that you start to get angry, yet it never gives you enough information to really know whats happening. I would reccomend passing on this movie. It was waste of precious time.PS: Will Smith is a great actor"
2,Bad Adaptation,I was very disappointed with this adaptation; the Charlton Heston version is much better in all aspects expect for the cinematography and computer generated NYC scenes.
3,I prefer 'A Boy and His Dog',"Ok, so 'A Boy and His Dog' is probably not an apt comparison - except for the fact that they are both 'Post Apocalyptic' films about a guy and a dog. 'I Am Legend' definitely had its good points - Will Smith was excellent, as always, and the overall production design was incredible. The whole 'look and feel' of NYC three years after a virus wiped out the entire human population was quite well done. However, the overall story line and relatively thin plot left me wanting something more, and the abrupt ending was unfulfilling. 3.5 stars."
4,Shelby Mustang GT500- I'm in.,"I could get up and do the dishes. I could...but the dog, Samantha, she's stealing the movie so far. She's so cute and I love dogs. I do want to see what happens to the dog. Oh, and now there's a flashback...seems like some sort 'Omega Man' type thing going on. There's vicious rats that I'll probably have nightmares about tonight and omigod, the monsters are for reals, very scary. Um, did I mention the freakin' car? Any gearhead worth her spit will get off on the 2007 Shelby Mustang GT500 as it literally destroys the streets of Manhattan, even if it is CGI. It's still a dream come true. Good story telling, escapism, and, in my opinion, the best actor of my generation, Will Smith. And definatly the best car. The dishes will have to wait."
4,A Good Movie but Not Great - Worth the Rental,"OK, this movie was pretty good but, not great. Oh...it was CREEEEPY! :)Will Smith does a great job of acting (5 stars for him)The plot is good - kept us engaged but, somebody dropped the ball. There were a few things that would have made the movie much better like showing how smart the ""mutants"" were, more flashbacks etc. 20 more minutes would have solved this. (4 stars)Special effects were....""so so"". (3 stars). The mutants were obviously CGI and not believable."
3,Overrated,i think this movie is Overrated . i thought it was ok but it was actually very boring at times. it is just ok for me .
2,Should have been better,"This looks like a straight transfer from a VHS tape that was released in the early 90's, and evidently Rhino did nothing as far as remastering either the video and audio, and that is very disappointing. Most of the video clips are grainy and of terrible quality. Seems Rhino could have put in a little effort and found better segments. Overall, it's a pretty good, if brief, history of how the Yardbirds came together, but little care went into video/audio quality. From now on, it'll make me wary of any future documentaries of this type from Rhino, who normally excel at music CD remasters, but have greatly disappointed me in their DVD music documentaries."
4,Aveeno lotion,I try to use most Aveeno products and I think it's great for my babies sensitive skin. Not too crazy about the smell though.
2,Aveeno Active Naturals,"Fragrance is way too strong for me - I put it on before bed and WHEW !!I wanted a different ""refreshing"" fragrance that is no longer made."
4,A good USB hub,"I am a long time Windows user. I bought this Tripp-Lite USB hub to expand my daughter's new iMac (OS 10.4). While I was researching the USB hub, I realize that not all USB hubs are created equal. I want something that will definitely work with the iMac even though I might need to pay a bit more. To my delight, the product works very well, and I have no problem to set it up. To balance its light-weight base, I use connections from both the front and the back and it stands up pretty stable. My daughter is pretty happy with it, and I am a satisfied customer. If the price could just come down a bit, I would definitely rank it 5 stars."
1,False warranty Information,"Not a negative review of the item.Amazon is advertising false warranty claims on this item. They claim it has a life time warranty, when in fact it is only 1 year. Do not purchase this item expecting extended support or replacement as advertised. Amazon does not seem to think that selling items under false pretenses is a big deal.As far as the hub is concerned it seems to be a quality hub. Hopefully it lasts longer than the last two powered hubs I had that just stopped working. Customer service at Amazon is a all time low as of late."
4,not a very practiced cook,so i needed the assistance of things that were simple to make. this is exactly what i wanted. condition is excellent
5,Great cookbook!,"I've always liked the versatile nature of Bisquick, and this cookbook just reinforces my feelings! Bisquick makes a great crust!"
1,Not a good product,"Older and sick folks are the ones who take pills and they are the ones who are likely hard of hearing. This product beeps a quiet beep and or warning once a minute for three minutes only. Then the banner comes across the screen stating missed dose. One has to look close to even pay attention to the display. We need a flashing light (bathrooms are dark all night) or alarm that continually sounds off until we reset it. Even the Chinglish is bad. Instead of ""take your pills"" it displays ""take your pilled"". Folks very lives depend upon their dosage and they cannot afford to gamble on Timex's shoddy product."
4,"Confusing at first, but suspenseful until the end....","Overall, I was kept interested, however it was difficult getting used to the rhythm of the rotating chapters of the 3 different story lines - the 2 possible scenarios and the view from back home. The one story line was suspenseful, but the other I found to be a bit trashy. The style of writing reminded me of the movie ""Sliding Doors"". It was an interesting way to write a book which you don't see very often. Not a very dramatic ending."
1,"Fine writer, bad book","After reading 'Mapping the Edge', I think it is apparent that Sarah Dunant is a gifted writer. I believe that I may try to read one of her other books, possibly 'Fatlands', but I could not recommend 'Mapping the Edge' to anyone.It is very possible that I have too much testosterone to understand the character of Anna. I found in the book's first 100 pages that Anna acts in a totally selfish, and to me, unfamiliar, way towards her child and loved ones. At this point, I did not care what happened to her, and I could not resurrect any such feelings as the book continued.I am sure that many people will find this book enjoyable, I, however, was not one of them."
3,Mapping the Edge,"I bought this book because I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the Sarah Dunant books that I have read so far. This book, however, was nothing like most of her historical fiction books. To make matters worse, I was reading this book while I was living in Florence while studying abroad! It was very spooky to think that something like that could happen to a tourist. Overall, the book was very suspenseful and entertaining, but unlike most of Dunant's books."
2,The Day After is OK,"The Day After **1/2 StarsDespite some good moments, this is an often, but decent follow third follow up to 1997's debut album from twista, it does have a few decent songs here and there, but the ending falls apart and the writing is mostly based of scratches.Although Twista still delivers that fast paced rapping, but the album is not quite recommendable, so I'm giving this a mild thumbs down."
2,Twista gone commercial,"Simply put, this album is far, far, FAR below the level of anything close to ""Adrenaline Rush"". Can't even compare. ""Adrenaline Rush"" was a masterpiece of sorts, and was classic, raw, underground Twista, before he went commercial. In a way you can't blame him because he finally is getting the recognition (and money!) he deserves. However, its sad that an artist has to go commercial for them to get recognition and the sales they are deserving. But for hip hop heads looking for the old Twista, sad to say this ain't it. Not even close. I'll always love Twista for ""Adrenaline Rush"" and ""Mobstability"", but after those two albums there was a significant dropoff, and it continues with this album."
3,"The Day After, The Album!!","NOTE:this is not even close to being better than kamikaze!!1. Day After 5/5 Good Starter!! Has A Good Story2. Check That H** 5/5 Good Beat, Loved It!!3. Chocolate Fe's and Redbones 2/5 Its Not The Worste Song!!4. Get It How You Live 3.5/5 Its Allright!!5. Lavish 5/5+++ Love It Fav Song!!, Has A Good Layback Beat!!6.

3,What happened to the old twista,"I'm not critizing twista's new album because he's definetely gotten better lyrically, but he has become to commercial. Kamikaze was great because he took a different direction making more love songs etc. It seems hes trying the same formula on the day after but personally i would like to see the old gritty street adrenaline rush flow again instead of the new and improved ladies man twista"
4,Good microphone but not as much power as I was expecting,"The Shure microphones I bought are very good mics, and the price on amazon.com was great. However, I don't get the power/volume on the Samson portable speaker I bought. I do get plenty of volume on the speakers using the iPod docking station, so i don't think it is the speakers - just not much volume with the microphones."
2,PRETTY-BUT,"tHE DOLL MEETS EXPECTATIONS FOR DETAIL AND ACCESSORIES, SHE IS VERY PRETTY AND ELEGANT-BUT SHE CAME WITH NO STAND!!! AN EXPENSIVE PORCELAIN DOLL REALLY SHOULD COME WITH A STAND"
1,Beware FDA Warning 70 dogs have died,"Check out this product their is a FDA warning many dogs have gotten deathly sick from eating these treats Made in China. My dog almost died and is still trying to recover from being poisoned by these. They would be recalled by now but the FDA told me that they don't know what the ingredient is that is sickening dogs so they can't recall? This has been going on since 2007. The owner of Dogwell could care less as I have also spoke with him bottom line for him $$$,not your pet. Do a little research google jerky treats from China you don't want your pet to go though what mine has. Bloody stools, vomiting, shaking, back legs became paralyzed he could not walk or stand."
3,Dog loves them but gets upset stomach,These are not good for my dog (Cavalier King Charles) as he gets diarrhea when he eats them. Otherwise good product for non-sensitive dogs.
1,Food from China is killing our pets!,"I used to feed these to my dogs with caution knowing that they come from China. The pet food store I bought them from got all the reports from the company about how good they are in quality. But even now the local *good* pet food stores are not carrying them. They don't want the liability of these items potentially harming and killing pets. It's not hard to do your own chicken jerky, or buy USA products. Don't just reduce the amount of these you are giving, just stop giving them. Let's buy from reputable sources. Remember the pet food from China a couple of years ago that was killing pets due to a contaminant?"
5,Eatwell chicken strip treats,"These are the favorite treats for my Chow Chow! She definitely prefers them to her natural dried dog food. She weighs about 80 lbs and I give her three to six strips each day. She is a stubborn dog, but I can always get her to come with the chicken strips. I'm also happy that they contain the recognized ingredients to help the joints of older dogs like mine (she is 11)."
3,Adequate,"This FM transmitter works. Its signal is weak, so volume on MP3 player AND on car radio both have to be pretty high. The power source only powers the transmitter, not the MP3 Player. Sound quality is good, to my untrained ear. Switching back to radio can be jarring if you forget to turn volume back to normal level. Otherwise, no complaints. It works with my iPod as well as a Creative Zen Stone MP3 player."
2,Works...decently.,"This transmitter works pretty well, I live in a fairly large city and when I am anywhere near the city, there is a lot of interference. Sometimes vehicles drive by that have their own transmitter working and it overpowers my signal, so I get their transmission clearer than my own signal.Today, after 4 months of owning it, it has stopped broadcasting the signal to my left speakers, so I am only getting sound on the right side.You get what you pay for."
3,It's OK.,"It gets the job done if you are not in the market to buy a new car with an MP3 jack anytime soon, but I guess it depends on how picky you are. You need to turn the volume up all the way on your mp3 player and the car volume up all the way just to get the volume up to a reasonable level (like talking loudly), and there is some static in the background on all of the channels but not to bad. Cable seems thick and of good quality."
4,An analysis of the Boso-Zoku gang sociology in Japan,"In a search for more information on the Boso-Zoku (Speed Tribe) culture within Japan, I came accross this book. Instead of an entertaining volume, I found it to be more of a scientific study into the behaviors and sociology of the Boso and Yankee sub-cultures. While extremely informative, it is not for casual reading. I have rated it a seven based upon what it is, and educational volume."
5,excellent movie a must see,"Great movie, it shows trujillo during his dictatorship and the death of jesus galindez and the C.I.A being part of this."
3,A OKAY BOOK BUT I HAVE RESERVATIONS,"I was in complete agreemnent with the first reviewer of this particular book. I did find certain aspects to be quite helpful and am certainly glad I added it to my collection (of books on this subject). On the other hand, I could not recommend it for the beginning in this wonderful hobby. To start with, the author did seem quite full of himself and did indeed treat the reader as if he were lecturing a small child. I am no expert in this area, but again, I did not just fall off a turnip wagon either. While worthwhile reading, there are certainly better books out there for the money and I would suggest you take a close look at some before you leap at this one. If like most of us, you do not have all that much money to throw around, you could probably spend you money more wisely elsewhere."
4,A Great Way To Learn About This Exceptional Band.,I've always enjoyed watching this documentary of Yes from time to time. It spans the entire history of the band up to the Union album and tour. Yes Years is more than worth the money paid for it. You can learn a lot about this original great band.
1,Dont Believe The Hype!!!!,"I'd happily soak up endless gallons of SWAK with my tongue, rather than watch this festering pile of crappola ever again!!!"
3,"poor storyline, poor acting, excellent special effects","This movie is about a professor searching for ""the meaning of life"" through exploring the effects of psychedellic mushrooms. Basically, the truth is right in front of him all along - it's the love of a woman who stays by his side throughout the movie despite being ignored and taken for granted. In the meantime, the young professor goes to S. America, does lab tests with his buddy, has children, gets seperated, does more tests...The only good thing about this otherwise predictable flick is the visual effects and imagery that was supposed to represent what the high looked like. I was quite impressed by that and nothing else. If you buy this movie, don't get your hopes up. With a little more effort and imagination, a film about this kind of subject matter could have been much, much better, though."
2,strange movie..,I thought this was going to be a movie about spiritual psychedelic experiences in a sensory deprivation tank...instead it was a sci-fi de-evolution horror movie...
3,Interesting,"I couldn't really get into this movie that much, but the subject matter was interesting. It's about a scientist (who is painted in an unconvincingly weird fashion) who is interested in consciousness and tries several means of regressing himself to earlier states of being (using Jung's ""genetic memory"" ideas here). The methods used include a combination of some South American psychedelic drugs (probably based on ayahuasca, a reasonably effective drug) and an isolation chamber. I don't think the movie accomplishes much, but it does manage to make one think, which is more than I can say for most."
4,Awesome Blu-ray,"A ridiculous, hokey sci-fi classic brought new life by Blu-ray. For anyone who saw it when it opened in theaters with its multi-speaker soundtrack, this will bring back cheesy memories!"
5,Realmente un disco de coleccion!,"Como seguidor de presuntos, tengo que decir que es uno de sus mejores trabajos, solo comparado con el disco La noche (para mi el mejor), en donde hacen lujo de un talento adquirido durante años atras. Los acordes son impecables y el uso de instrumentos fabuloso, temas como Llovió, Sentir su calor, y Cuando quiero sol, sin olvidar a como hemos cambiado son altamente recomendables; y en donde, otra vez, la voz de Sole nos hace volar y solo pensar:...porque hay canciones tan bellas.."
4,Mystifying and Mesmerizing,"This group is comprised of the lead singer of the supreme black metal band Emporer, his wife and brother-in-law. The music is very different from Emporer. More symphonic and melodic in general, with quite unusual vocals, alternating in style between shrieking (black metal) and quasi-operatic. The female vocalist is interesting, and while not possessing the strongest voice, her vocals are captivating. Strong compositions (dark and brooding) and very well-played. If you like Therion, the Gathering or even Cradle of Filth, you will enjoy this."
2,This one was disappointing,"I started with book 1 of the series and loved each one I read til I got to this one. In the books prior to this, they took the time to help you get to know the characters first before diving into the plot. This time they didn't do that. It felt rushed and even tho it was full of action, I couldn't care less about what happened to any of the characters because I hadn't gotton to know them. I kept forcing myself to keep reading but eventually had to put the book down and go on to the next one in the series (people of the sea). I'm only on page 31 but I already have much more interest in the characters this time."
4,Was it that long ago?,"It is encouraging that this set may have been prompted by success of ""The Best of Braodside"" out on Folkways last year. In this case you get a pretty panoramic look at folk based music in the early 60s and people are certain to disagree on what is good or bad, should be in or should be out. The bottom line is that no matter what your point of view there is a lot of high quality music here and a good look at how folk music planted seeds for a lot of what is still happening in contemporary music. It was a great time, it was (and is) great music and one thing that can be agreed upon is that having Judy Henske's ""High Flying Bird"" back in print is a real important plus."
5,Love this CD,I love the mellow sound of accordion and mandolin. Wonderful CD. A nastalgic trip back to the times of romance and appreciation of beauty.
2,I love Stephen King but.....,"This was not one of his best works, this movie has so much repetitiveness and an exteamly slow story, it did not have to be as long as it was which is too bad this story could have had a lot of potential.If you looking for a good Stephen King TV movie try The Stand, Storm of the Century, It or even The Langoliers those are so much better and far more superior than the Golden Years."
