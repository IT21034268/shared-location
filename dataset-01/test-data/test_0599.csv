5,Doctor's recommondation,My daughter has sensitive skin and vanicream is the beast for her skin. It keeps the skin softall day long so I like it very much. Thanks
1,Died after 13 months of barely being used!,"I purchased this drill for my 2-4"" holes saws. Thought with the angle handle and high amp's it would be great. I must say, it worked perfect for the 1 year warranty period. Shortly after (13 months) it just completely stopped on me as i was drilling a 1/2"" hole for a lag bolt. I was very dissapointed. I have a 20+ year old Milwaukee (6.8amp w/out a right angle handle), still works just as good today as it did the day I purchased it. So when the Dewalt died, I replaced it with another 1/2"" drive Milwaukee with the handle. I would recommend not purchasing any Dewalt tools, even if you ""joe home owner"" just using them around the house. All my Dewalt tools (1/2 drive drill, jig saw, reciprocating saw, and radio) all died within 3 years of purchase. They all had light use, nothing strenuous. Spend a few extra $$ and buy a Bosch, Milwaukee, or even Makita."
1,Very Disapointed,"I orderd this DVD because it said it had subtitles, when I received it and began to watch it I quickly learned other wise. The DVD did not have subtitles. The case for the DVD said there were subtitles but there were no such thing, or any sort of opption allowing you to add them. I was really looking forward to watching this documentary and was very disponited in my purchase."
2,Just OK.,I got this shampoo since my trainer swears by it with the Brazilian Keratin treatment. I was not so impressed. My hair felt stiff afterwards and needed a good conditioner. Did not love it.
1,Horrible!,"I started taking this about 6 months ago. Since then I started having stomach issues and hormonal problems. After months of endoscopy, ultrasounds, and MRI's I found all of my problems were related to taking this sea kelp! I would steer clear of this product!!!"
2,Benefits are overstated,"While I like this brand of supplement, I did not find it produced the type of results that are claimed in the description."
5,The sound,"This album has the sound Tim was trying to acheive.... if you close your eyes you can almost see the was crackling fire, the snow falling down. Track 10 you can hear the truth in his voice. This album is Tim's live show."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,As a whole this is one of the best cds I've heard yet! There are so many songs on this that I listen to over and over again. My absolute favorite is Tim's cover of Tiny Dancer. It stays true to the heart of the song. When I start trying to list other favorites I can't because there are so many. My daughter and I already know every word to every song. This is a great purchase! Thank's Tim and the Doctors for great music!
5,Wonderful,Tim McGraw is at it again. He performs like no one else in the country business today. His music is down to earth and makes the world around us slow down. The idea of recording with his road band was just what this album needed. The addition of famous background vocals just added to the magic of this album. Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors is a great cd and Tim will continue to record the best music out there.Keeper1702
5,Tim's Best CD yet,This is a wonderful CD. This is Tim at his very best. There are a variety of songs that will fit any style of music you prefer. Whether you like older traditional country or something a little more contempory you will love this CD. My teenage daughter who hardly ever listens to country is now listening to Keith Urban and Brooks and Dun because she loved this CD so much. Tim's cover of Elton's tiny dancer is just terrific. I can hardly wait to see what he comes up with next!
5,Wonderful CD for everyone,"This CD is a must have. I have enjoyed it from the day I first purchased it. Along with Tim's book, this CD is probably the best use item I have. You've gotta check it out."
1,I'd hide my face too.,"Tim McGraw is a joke, period. I would rather listen to a bloodbath in a slaughterhouse than this. People who make a living singing songs written for them aggravates me in the first place, but Tim goes to the point of ridiculous. 'Red Ragtop' is the most wretched and vile thing I think has done in quite awhile. Like nails on a chalkboard, Tim delivers again his whiny, feminine, voice that sounds like he has been injesting female hormones again.Tim is fortunate to live in America, where the sheep viewers of CMT can be lead to buy anything. Anywhere else, where he would have to rely on songwriting skills and talent, he would starve while singing on a street corner with an empty tin cup."
1,Don't Bother,"Mr. Timmy Boy McGraw's lack of ethics has become so flagrant that it merits your complete attention. Permit me this forum to rant. Does he have trouble living with himself, knowing that his ""compromises"" are wicked but reflective of the localized normative attitudes among soulless, narrow-minded morons? The complete answer to that question is a long, sad story. For now, I'll just say that one does not have to regulate imperialism in order to exert a positive influence on the type of world that people will live in a thousand years from now. It is a lethargic person who believes otherwise. He is too eccentric to reason with, by which I mean that if you are not smart enough to realize this, then you become the victim of your own ignorance. Now that this letter has come to an end, I unquestionably hope you walk away from it realizing that Mr. Timmy Boy McGraw has no table manners."
5,Tim's best album to date,"Like any true fan, I purchased Tim McGraw's CD at 12:01 AM on Tuesday November 26th. Let me just say that Mr. McGraw has put out an album that does not dissapoint! From ""Comfort Me"" to ""Tiny Dancer,"" this album is packed full of unforgetable songs! My personal favorite is ""That's Why God Made Mexico"" and is a quieter song with a strong piano background. Tim's voice flows through this album and reaches heights that he has not attempted in previous albums. I recommend this album to everyone because it will surely be the CMA album of the year for 2003!"
5,"Yeah, she is good!!","Yes, Mafalda is strongly recomended for those who like feeling in the lyrics! Never before heard such a great talent, esasy listening and melodic voice. Philosophic verses are ought to be analized and then take a lap of comfort."
2,Dificult to dissect,I would have preferred a more contemporary translation. Good material here just tough to mine it out of the stilted language.
5,"The best ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" book","""Hyperspace"" is my favorite of the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books I have read, and it definitely deserves to be brought back into print. Its highly self-referential storyline results in such delights as characters who know they're characters in a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" story, and what surely must be the most surprising cameo in the series--an appearance by a certain person whose last name is that of an old model of car... This book is a true classic of the heyday of plot-your-own stories."
4,A very colorful & Literary Soap Opera,"I'm not totally done reading the book yet, but so far it has become, (keyword: become) a great book which is very attracting and makes me want to read on and on! At first, it was hard to keep track of the characters but they become all intertwined at some point, which makes it easier to grasp. The vocabulary was a little above my level, using the french language frequently, but still I understood the events happening. The book is a real soap opera, but more colorful than the ones on the television."
1,bitter disappointment,The story line was extremely interesting to me. But I kept waiting for the story to esculate and it never did. I will not recomend this book or buy any other sequels. This book was a waste of time and the writer should maybe work on their craft a few more years and try again
3,Interesting Characters!,"Although the book was filled with interesting characters, it needed more ...ummm... something. I do not know what, but it lacked something. I could not put the book down and I did not want it to end. The characters intrigued me, but it comes to a closing way too fast. Yes, that was it... the end ... just came too abruptly. It was building up then THE END! It left me wanting MORE!"
4,Delicious Iniquity,"In his first collection of tales, A UNIVERSAL HISTORY OF INIQUITY, Borges serves up a delicious mingling of fictionalized fact and semifactual fiction. Though the stories contained in this volume pale in comparison to much of his later work, they nonetheless sparkle with the genius of a master in the making. For discerning readers who are yet to discover the literary wonders of Jorge Luis Borges, the bite-size yarns in this slim compilation are certain to provide a delightful introduction."
4,Learning Veterinary Terminology,"This book was a great help during my Veterinary Assistant class. My Teacher, who is also a Vet Tech, told it was a must. It helped us break down terms, learn anatomy and body systems."
3,Didn't fit my 94 Jeep 4.0,"Well, it's a nice muffler. It was close, almost a perfect fit.The over all size is 25 1/2 inches long.Muffler is 20 inches.4 1/4"" thick x 9 3/4"" wide.The in and out are 2 1/4 inches.That's where the problem lies.The ""original"" tail pipe is 2 inches outside diameter.There is no good way to make the muffler fit to the new tail pipe.It said it was exact fit, but there is no way this is original fit.My old muffler is 2 1/4 in and 2 1/16 out. The new tailpipe fit to the old muffler perfectly.So I saved the old muffler, which wasn't rusted too badly.I would have known NOT to order this if ANYONE showed the diameter of these mufflers. But it's really hard to figure out without that info, which is readily available on EVERY box label.Why none of the auto parts stores or the various websites list this info is a mystery to me."
2,Virtuoso Players Gild the Lilly,Reviewers who write that these are fine musicians playing lousy arrangements are correct. That's it exactly. The slower cuts are better than the up-tempo ones. Apparently this CD is a big hit with bagpipe tooters. So be it. The rest of us should pass it by or purchase it used.
1,Keep looking - there is much better stuff than this,"This album is a perfect example of how a bad arrangement can ruin great music despite the best efforts of great musicians. Everything about this recording is right; selection, performers, sound engineering. Except that the tracks are horribly over-arranged with all sorts of distracting, subtracting variations and trite bridging passages."
3,Good polish pop,She is really popular in Poland but here noone hears about her.She has really good voice but music is only good . She should start singing something more professional and with good musicians
2,WORKED FOR 3 MONTHS,"I bought this item for my mother. She copied about 40 CDs over a 3 month period when it stopped working(right at the 3 month warranty period cutoff). She took it to a repair shop who said the microchip went out and would cost $50 to repair (more than 1/2 of what it cost to purchase it 3 months earlier). I contacted Amazon who said they would normally replace it, but couldn't because they couldn't get anymore from the manufacturer. Amazon took it back and refunded most of my money (less a $18.98 restocking fee). I'm kind of miffed about that, but I guess it's better than nothing. If it had worked, it would have been a great deal. All other duplicators that I've priced cost at least 3 times as much. I'm sure this one could have been a fluke and others work great, but I think this item needs a longer warranty period from either the manufacturer or Amazon for just this reason."
4,Mysterious!,I don't really like the way that there is a magical staircase in the kids' closet. Princess Keeah is my favorite character. I don't like Lord Sparr.
5,Reviewed by Ann G,"The Gift of GabeReviewed by Ann GRecommended to me at a time when I was questioning my own spiritual values, all I could say was, ""Wow"", when I finished. The concepts really resonated with me. I couldn't believe that there might be other people out who were thinking about some of the same concepts I was. I had the feeling I was no longer alone and was so uplifted upon reading it, I still refer to it today. I have gifted it three times over. Oh yes, if you are also a music lover, you will definitely enjoy the modern references to some of today's most well known poets and songwriters. The Gift of Gabe was an easily readable story about an adult awakening to the spiritual side of himself. The book simply illustrates some complex metaphysical concepts. If you enjoyed the Celestine Prophecy, this is a book definitely worth reading."
5,Less Expensive is Better!,"We have purchased several expensive ($40-$70)remote-controlled planes only to be disappointed with their performance. My son had gone to a friend's house to play one day and he had an E-Charger plane. I was so impressed I got one for my son for Christmas! This little devil is easy to use (my son is 9), performs as promised and is loads of fun! Plan to purchase the water plane next!"
2,Franklin Electronic Bible,"If you are looking for high tech. then this is not for you. The display is not very easy to read in low light and there are only three short lines displayed at a time. Keys are very small for anyone with big finger tips, like most men. The unit performs well for what it was designed to do. It is easy to use and can be self taught."
1,no,"total trash. shes hot but getting fame by having some stupid couple feud is dumb. this isnt real beef, this is a stupid high school break up. at least the Nas and JayZ beef was interesting but a girl and a guy fighting with each other is soo stupid."
1,Not Good!!!,"frankee, you had a hit with FURB, by copying Eamon! You had your little controversy! Now it is over! this album is just S S S, (meaning sh..!) i have to give all the songs 1/100!Frankee stop lying to yourself you didnt go out with eamon so hush your lip!"
2,Ok album.,"Despite her shameful dis record torwards Eamon, Frankee's album is pretty decent. She has a nice voice and some of the song are good to sing along to. The choice is yours to whether you decide to cop this or not."
4,Good English oi!,"This is a really good CD. Hardskin's first effort is a good one. The songs are pretty original and they even do a cover of the 4 Skin's ""ACAB,"" except Hardskin changes the name to ""ACAC,."" This is good English oi! that is really funny! Most of the songs are about drinking and fighting (Traditional skinhead pasttimes)The lyrics are halarious and it is obvious that the band is pretty drunk during the recording."
1,color theory,"excellent book for any artistthis should have a five-star rating, but item 2 will not print 5 stars."
3,ribbonwork the complete guide,when you want to make a gift special this book will have your flowers very creative and lets you pick those special colors with out a lot of mess. great book
2,Sound not so good.,"I just received these ear-buds. The look an feel of them are a little cheap in my option, but that can be overlooked. The cord is much shorter then i thought. Now as far the sound goes... I cant say that I like the sound to much at all. When I used them on my laptop the sound was so muffled an hardly any bass. It sounded like an old radio that's on its last leg. I then tried them on my phone an it did sound a little better but still muffled with not much bass. I will be looking for a new pair from a different brand soon."
3,They are noisy,"They are noisy. I also bought the model with no volume control, and is much better.After that one, I bought a Sennheiser, and this last one is awesome. Next time I will buy a Sennheiser and I will spend my money only once."
1,Absolutely worst sound I've ever heard.,Bough them as a replacement for my Nokia 5228 (and they are BAD)... first time i plugged in ...i was like wtf...!! sound is absolutely ridicules... maybe i just wasn't lucky with specific buds...but i'll never buy from coby again. Go for sony or something better.
2,Does not make music sound good,"I loved the original COLBY headphones then one earphone went dead.So I bought these with the volume control and thought I would be getting the greatest headphones.Every single kind of music I listened to wearing these headphones sounded muffed.Nothing sounded good. Every one star review for this product is true , but I'm giving it 2 stars because of the price."
3,not impressed,First I'll say I got a great deal on mine. So I wasn't too upset that the maximum volume wasn't very high at all or that the buds kept falling out of my ears. I only used this when I worked out so I'm sure they would be fine if you used them for something other than an active hobby.
4,"Low Cost, Great Sound","These are a nice pair of earphones. Firstly you must realise that there are fine wires inside this unit, hence if you rough them up too much, they won't last very long. I find that the sound reproduction is acceptable and the bass depth is beyond reproach.Here are the specifications for these earphones:- Impedance: 16 ohms +/- 10%- Frequency Range: 20 - 20,000 Hz- Sensitivity: 102 dB +/- 3% /1mW @ 1kHz- Rated/Max Input Power: 5mW/10mW- Driver Size: 9 mm- Weight: 14.8gI find that these are a nice set of earphones, however, for their longevity, due care must be taken with them."
3,Substandard Noise Cancelling,"The silicone plugs work to marginally reduce ambient noise. These are nowhere near the effectiveness of other noise-reducing earbuds I have tried. However, since they are so cheap, I am still satisfied. Also, the package I received did not contain a second size of ear plugs."
2,Muddy like woah.,"I was swayed by the rock bottom price and fairly high review but was highly disappointed. The AM radio comment is spot on. Music was pretty muddy sounding but then I tried to use these with streaming video (hulu, netflix, etc) and they were not even really usable. Granted, the source of this audio isn't the best, dialogue was just terrible muffled. I'll probably throw these in my glovebox or with my cycling gear for emergencies but I don't expect them to get used much. Certainly they are more comfortable than the buds that come with an ipod but sounding like you're underwater just doesn't make up for it."
2,Coby Earphones,There is very little bass in these headphones. It's all midrange.The volume control is pretty good though.
2,COBY CVE91BLK,"I BOUGHT A COUPLE OF THESE BECAUSE OF THE PRICE, NOT KNOW THAT THESE BECOME USELESS AFTER YOU USE THEM A COUPLE TIMES. I ALREADY WENT THROUGH FOUR OF THEM IN LESS THAN EIGHT MONTHS. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR BETTER PRODUCT."
2,Bad sound quality,"Just got these and the sound quality is pretty bad. They basically mimic what you would hear out of an alarm clock radio...muffled, no bass, etc. The sound quality that comes from the earphones you get from an iphone or ipod is 10x better than these. I would not recommend these to anyone who is looking for good sound."
3,Noise-e!,"Like many others, I bought these because they were such a great deal and because they had volume control on the cord.I use them with my iPod while riding my road bike and the wind noise is incredible. Yuh, I know that when I am riding I create the wind in my face but with my old Skull Candy earphones, there was little or no wind noise...but (then again) there is no volume control on the cord. These are comfortable, but they do not block the background wind noise."
1,"Will shock you, literally!","I dont know why, but i bought two sets of these headphones. No matter which device they are plugged into, if i move my head they will shock the inside of your ear! Not joking. Its very annoying. I wouldn't recommend buying them."
4,Afforable,for a low price like this it is an amazing deal! sound quality is pretty good for 5 dollars. also the only bad thing is the volume changer it can get a little annoying and turn the volume low by its self
1,You get what you pay for.,"If this is for 10 yr olds it's ok, but my 15yr old knew it was a inferior product before he opened them."
1,terrible,lousy.We ended up getting different ear plugs because when exercising these would stay in your ears.Had to get a different brand that has the blue tooth look to stay in place while exercising.
3,coby cheesy,"sound quality not that great.good as a starter earbud,but for better sound upgrade is the word."
4,"good product, but not durable","It worked well, while it lasted, with in 3-4 months one of the speakers stopped working.no very durable."
4,Just 5 jest fajne ale.......,"Zespol robi sie bardzo popularny nie tylko w Polsce ale tez w Ameryce.Spiewaja jak Backstreet Boys i N'Sync.Ja za tymi grupami nie przepadam,dlatego dalam 4 gwiazdki."
5,B.G. - Back on top again.,"Damn boy did his thing with this one. He got made jams on there. You put it on and press play and forget about it because you don't even need to change any songs. His response to Khia ""My Neck My Back"" is off the chain like a year to late but still worth it. My opinion the best he has done so far out of 8 that's damn good."
4,Good book on HBS,"Not a bad book except for the fact that the author's liberal leanings were too obvious. HBS (or any business school for that matter) is meant to teach business leaders, not focus on making graduates respected social agenda leaders. The author took several shots at the decade of the 80s and the Reagan era, but certainly gave a pass on the corrupt 90s (WorldCom, Enron, etc.) and the Clinton years.All in all, though, I enjoyed the background on some of the key graduates, but I would not buy another book by this author."
2,disappointed,This book is a let down. The pop-ups are not pretty at all. Everything seems to be the same color.
4,Toddlers have fun with Video Now,"My 2 & 3 year old boys loe having their separate movie players even though we have a 10"" portable dvd player. I just wish that there was more educational movies for the player! Looks like most stores in my area are discontinuing the Video Now Jr and discs. This was a great Christmas present from thier Uncle!"
3,For a small apartment only - Short range reception only,This is not product for a large house or if you want to work on your garden and monitor the little one.The long range reception is very poor. For a small apartment or house I believe is very good.
1,Huge interference,Unfortunately this product only has two channels and on both all we heard were other people talking continuously. Kind of hard to hear the baby crying when some woman is gossiping endlessly on the phone somewhere in the area.
5,I love this book!,"This book is the definitive book on Incorporating! It was as though Mr. Brown was sitting in my house with me, answering my questions before I knew I had them. Outstanding! This man is a genius on incorporating! Good Work!"
4,The War on Urbanism,"Daniel Lazare's America's Undeclared War: What's Killing Our Cities and How We Can Stop It carries a rather sensationalist title, but drives home a good deal of hardheaded historical analysis before succumbing to some woolly proposals. Lazare exposes antiurban bias from Jefferson through the Progressive movement, Fordism, Mumford (!) and their latter-day heirs. His take on the Progressives is revelatory: their distaste for urban ""squalor"" and their do-gooder program of uplift make me reach for my Mencken. He is right to chastise acclaimed urbanist Jane Jacobs for her anti-political mentality: her ""microscopic approach was both her strength and her undoing."" His critique of the Constitution, which references his previous work The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution is Paralyzing Democracy, warrants further inquiry. But he falls prey to an ungrounded exaltation of democracy that almost derails his sometimes sensible solutions."
5,Easy To Read,"We bought this weather station for my wife's mother. Her eyes are extremely bad, but the numbers are large enough, and dark enough for her to read. This was the selling point for us on this item. Also, we didn't have any trouble setting it up."
5,The strangest thing ever...,"I bought this movie because I had seen it at a film festival in Los Angeles and I loved it. Seeing it again, I swear the movie gets weirder and weirder. The style and pace is strangely hypnotic and watching the movie is like being a little kid again only experiencing childhood through an adult's eyes. It's not a perfect movie on the surface, but it holds up very well and really does grow on you. Clearly, this was the intent of the filmmakers, and I think they did a very good job messing with my head! Excellent soundtrack and the performances seem off in the beginning but as you watch it, you realize how good and consistent everyone is. Highly recommended."
1,What were they thinking? Why would they bother?,"Unnecessary, puerile, insipid, pointless, wasteful, silly, trivial, fatuous. Avoid wasting your time and money on this one. I usually give films or books that I don't like to the library hoping someone will enjoy them, but 'Neverland' has an appointment with Mister Dumpster."
1,Terrible!,This movie was terrible. I quit watching after a half hour. The only reason I gave it one star is that it wouldn't let me leave no stars!
2,Not as described,"This scale is great, except for the fact that it is not exactly as it was described. I ordered this one because of it's review in Cook's Illustrated, and the description on Amazon indicated that it measured in 1/8 ounces. This is not true: instead, ounces are measured in increments of 1/10. This is annoying as many recipes call for flour in increments of 1/8 ounces. I don't have time to send it back before I need to start using it or else I would, instead I'll just be converting ounces to grams. Lame. The huge display is great though."
5,great product,"We bought this because it was recommended by America's Test Kitchen, we have only used it for baking flour so far, but it works and is easy to read."
5,a cabin in the sky it is!!!!,"Worth buying, for the very beautiful Winter2 alone. I'd already heard the marvelous opener 'A Cabin In The Sky' a few times on the John Peel Show & wondered if the rest of the album could possibly live up to it. But there's so many strong tracks on this album, the afore mentioned Winter being my favourite, other standouts being The Atoms Of The Sea [a must for fans of the Lawrie/Doran trademark vocal harmonies], A Good Place To Hide, [spooky jazz noir] & the epic When Nemo Sank The Nautillus. After a few listens I'd say this is their finest, most consistant album to date, head & shoulders above the patchy Creation album. Far out. I'm really interested to see where they're going to take us to next, the possibilities seem endless."
2,Bottom of the Feist pile,"The pace built up over the previous Riftwar / Serpent war novels slowed to a snails pace with this episode. My ideal for a Fantasy novel is to take me away from the ""hum-drum"" of everyday life. This was like watching a documentary on Commerce - not my scene. Here's to the ""Demon King"" and a little excitement."
2,Short Advance.,"As the title suggests, Rise of a Merchant Prince is primarily about Roo Avery. Much of the first novel is about Erik, though Roo is there in most of the novel. To me 'Rise' has many plot twists that are too convient and sudden: Erik suddenly pulled out of the main story, Roo's father in law's murder, and even the ending. In terms of advancing the plot in the series, maybe a third of the novel is devoted to it. It felt like the novel took awhile to really go and when it did, it barely went anywhere. The ending feels very arbitrary and unnatural. While I plan on reading the rest of the series, I can only hope they are better than this one. Roo is a more complicated character than most of Feist's characters in having a different set of morals than most of his usual characters that are usually easy to guess their actions. I have to give Fiest credit for trying new things with his characters."
4,Fills up some gaps; informative esp. concerning economics.,"In truth, I was a bit disappointed with this book. It may lie in my lack of interest in economics per se, but I still give Mr. Feist credit for helping us see who Roo Avery really is. Oh, the lad has a good heart I assume since he's one of the leading protagonist in the saga, but...the book lack, er, action as one would expect from a Fantasy book.Still, I'm not an expert in prose or characterization so yeah, I can't give him a 5 star rating because of the lack of action I expected (and a little more info please on the other characters i.e. Calis, Miranda. Still, I'm glad Feist let me catch a glimpse of a day in the life of Roo Avery. I can't wait to read the next book where, hopefully, the action starts."
2,Good reading. . . .,"This book was very interesting. As a student at Byron Center High School, in Byron Center, Michigan, I was required to read this book in a class. Our class engaged in very heated discussions and debates over the ideas presented in this book. I would recommend this book to any school interested in incorporating the Choice Theory into their school!"
4,Independent Gem,"I saw Sabot in their element: a small independent club, with a crowd of less than 40 present. Strictly instrumental, Sabot's bass and drums are all that is used to produce an exiting, very varied sound. The performance I saw took over an hour, and never got boring- a great accomplishment for an instumental band with only two members. Both of which are very much virtuosos; changes of rhythm follow eachother rapidly yes unpredictably. Their sound is reminiscent of early Rage Against the Machine and Primus. Besides this, they're really very nice people. See them live if you can; if you buy any of their records, you will not be sorry. The only downside of this album is that it is only little over 40 minutes long."
2,A lot of money for a little book,"This being the only book on the subject that was on the bookshelf in the brick&morter store, I was very disappointed in the author's handling of certain key aspects of the subject, that I felt, as a novice were very important.Specificly alternative sources of suitable supplies and materials."
4,How Much??? What!!!,My parrot loves them but I'm older and on a fixed income and they are way too expensive. I wish you could put them on sale or lower their price.
3,Scenic Workouts Monterey Coast,"It had beautiful scenery and was nice and long for an effective and lengthy workout on the treadmill - the video was a bit unsteady at times, but all in all very good. I do have an IFit equipped treadmill, not with the tv screen. So I compensate by using my laptop. I start the treadmill, activiate active workout on IFit, pop in the DVD and set my laptop on top of the treadmill. I also use external speakers for the laptop so I can crank up the nature sounds. Feels like you are actually out and about in nature."
5,Great Live Album,This is a great live album. Full of lots of funny moments and the hidden track with outtakes is great. A+ job for FIF. Can't wait for the new studio album.
5,Cool,"I bought this because I like the color red, and carbon fiber. It is red and carbon fiber. Super light. Don't even have a light bike so it doesn't matter. Only bought it for the looks and to feel better about myself. Mission accomplishedAlso my bottle fits perfect and tight in it."
4,Do My Ladies Run This Mother-4-Ya????,"Destiny Reyes is a hired killer for the Webster Projects crew. How did a sexy woman become a hit woman for one of the grimiest crews in NYC? After avenging her parents deaths Destiny becomes enthralled with killing. So enthralled that when forced to choose between her profession and her fiancé and her young son she chooses the former.But when the lives of her family are jeopardized when someone places a hit on her and her entire family, she'll risk her life to protect those that she loves. Born Assassins is a fast paced, action packed book. Come watch a Murder Mami put it down for the ladies!!!!"
1,Doesn't work with a MAC,"It works for a little while, then al the sound goes dead. Reboot. Same thing, might work for a minute or two, then it goes quiet. When on the internet and found a lot of horror stories about trying to run this thing on a mac. Wish I would have done more homework before spending my money. No response from customer service or the retailer (Electronica Direct). I plan to go see the M-Audio people at the Namm show and raise hell."
4,A Must for Your Financial Library,"The Ultimate Credit Handbook was one of the best purchases I've made. It goes beyond the normal ""we'll show you how to fix your credit-type"" schemes and resources. Detweiler is honest with not providing any information that would give the impression that repairing your credit is an easy task.This book was especially more helpful, because it was the first resource I've read (and there's been quite a few) that went through and actually explained certain processes and systems. For anyone serious about improving their score, its a resource you should have.The only disappointment is that the book is more for the person starting out on the ""repairing trail."" If you've started the process and have it pretty much under control, there may be very little to assist you further.But don't sleep, its worth the money. When done, pass it on to a family member or friend."
3,Slowly fades to obscurity,"I gave this book 3 stars out of 5 because the first three-fifths of it are interesting and well crafted. Unfortunately, the ending of the book is implausible and confusing with an ending that leaves the reader hungry. This was my first North novel and based on reviews of his other books, not a good first choice."
5,This a Camero Muffler,Installed on my 2003 Dodge Intrepid SXT giving me dual exhaust. Works and sounds great especially when removing the rear resonator.
5,The Only Book you need for Herbs and Oils,"You can try other books but this is the best. Simple , clear explanations and recipies . She is very good at explaining how ,why , and what to use for the best results. I have many others from over the years , but always come back to this one. She rocks. I can not recommend this book highly enough, a MUST HAVE for any herb and oil worker. Truely wonderful. She is a blessing."
1,Boring!!!!,"This book was just plain stupid. I am an avid reader of sci-fi and I found this book, Anti-Ice, to be dry, and bland."
2,Optilux 9005 XB Series HB3/9005,"I bought this for my IS300 for the DRL and I tried everything it did not fit into the socket like the Original ones, I wanted this to give my car a true blue color, but it didn't. I do not recommend these bulbs. If you want to have blue lights!"
5,5 Stars & 3 Cheers to J&D,"Having read internet reviews on chocolate fountain disasters, I ordered two 3lb tubs of liquid chocolate together with my new chocolate fountain for a friend's wedding. J&D has a fantastic product ! The delivery time was great, the packaging was truly impressive, the product usage was simplicity itself, and the chocolate was just delicious. We poured the liquid chocolate into the fountain and set it running. Literally five minutes from empty fountain to line of people thrilled by the sight of gorgeous smooth flowing chocolate. Fountain clean-up afterwards was so quick and easy. Will definitely buy this product again."
2,"Contains lactase enzyme, but not much of it","When I opened the package, these capsules were PACKED, so naturally I thought I was getting a good deal. Well...These capsules definitely contain lactase, but not the 3750 FCC that is claimed (claimed 10,000 / 3 capsules, 1 FCC unit is defined as the amount of lactase required to digest 1 gram lactose). Tried to dissolve the contents of 4 capsules in a gallon of milk (contains something less than 100 gm lactose) as I have done with similar preparations and there remains a lot of undissolved filler, also the milk doesn't get noticeably sweeter as it _should_ when lactase digests lactose into galactose and glucose. That's not to mention that symptoms of lactose intolerance that these capsules do not appear effective at preventing...To sum it up, these capsules contain:-Lots of filler that doesn't dissolve and is not lactase.-Very little enzymatically active lactase.2 stars because it's not a complete sham, but certainly not worth purchasing again."
4,Baseball Fielding Tips That Are Real ! A Perfect Little League Helper!,Just downright very good baseball tips that our youth teampracticed and got better! Confidence and overcoming any fear of thebaseball is the key to all of Little League. This program rocks!Baseball Coaching:Schupak's Baseball Super 8 DVD SetThis eight baseball DVD set by Marty Schupak is also popular with Little League coaches & parents.Youth Baseball DrillsThis youth baseball book by Marty Schupak is also very popular.
3,Love the size,"We purchased this blanket in another pattern/color for a 4-day, family camping trip. The size is awesomely big -- larger than most we found online. It was used in our tent as an extra layer of warmth on a rainly camping weekend. We took it home, washed it, and was really bummed to find the binding had came undone along the edge. Otherwise, a great blanket!"
4,A Very Good Series,"This series is wonderful! However, on this seventh season I was disappointed because Sarah is absent and we don't see very much of Felicity (on the first couple episodes and on the very last) and Gus (on the very last episode). If you go onto Netflix you'll notice that most of the reviews are all negative. I honestly think they were all exaggerating. The first six seasons were just a little better, but the seventh is still very good and touching. You definitely need this season to comlete your Avonlea series. It is still worth the money and I am very glad I invested in this one. I highly recommend this and all the other seasons!"
5,rage,"I'VE READ ALMOST ALL OF HIS WORKS AND i CONSIDER RAGE OF A DEMON KING ONE OF THE FINIST BOOKS HE WROTE, tHE ACTION AND THINGS PEOPLE DO AND WHAT THE SETTLEMENTS MEANS TO ME."
1,Typical Feist...Four books to tell a one book story,"Raymond Feist likes to take his time developing a story, that's for sure. Just like his other series, Feist takes a pretty good idea and drags out the climax for well over a 1000 pages. I liked the concept started in the first book and even appreciated the character development carried into the second in the series. However, by the third book I was was saying to myself, ""Please get on with it!"" As I step back and look, nothing but character development happened in the the first thousand or so pages. A couple minor adventures and the retrieval of several old characters from Midkemia's past prepare us for a major conflict that still has not become clear. I wish I could give this a higher rating because the ideas and twists are respectable. However, this could have been a two book series and given the reader a lot richer and faster paced diversion."
2,Move on...,This is the first Feist book that has let me down. I've loved everything he has written in the past and now the whole wonderful universe he created with his previous books has come crashing down with this one. I agree with the reviewer who said that Feist should close the book on Midkemia and move on.
4,Not a total success,"although his new book has more war and battles, but so what. what i liked most was how he summed-up each charcters life when they died.But the plot clearly wasn't as good as the riftwar saga. so unless you are a diehard fan of feist, i don't really recommand this book"
5,It's pretty awwesome man,"This was a cool book and I can't wait to read ""Shards of a Broken Crown""!I have been following the entire series and like the others. This one ranks high in my opinion."
5,Awesome,It's in great condition! I bought it for my nephew and he loves it! It's exactly like the one I had when I was younger. Love it!!
1,Great concept.......,"I would love to meet the person who designed this awful piece of software. As mentioned before the text prints out so badly you cannot even read it, there is no central database for all data, each new cd has to be registered and every time you seem to do something it asks you to enter a cd you just put back in the awkward packaging. Why National Geographic didn't use something like Adobe Acrobat to put this package together I will probably never know. Bad show Mindscape for rendering a potentially fantastic product practically unusable."
2,"Great concept, horrible execution.....","I bought this set immediately after it was released and was apalled at what I had bought. While the concept of having every issue on disc was a great idea, the use of JPEG images for the data instead of PDF was completely botched.Tech support, back in 1996, said they could have used less compression on the images of the pages, but they would have had to use even more than the 30+ CDs they had in the set and they decided that merely HAVING every issue would make up for any shortcomings in presentation.The end result: a [very costly] set of 30 CDs I hardly ever use and it's a shame as I really wanted to sit back and enjoy as many issues as I could but the text, while mostly legible, is a chore to read.Spend your money elsewhere or go to the library!"
3,"Great content, but horrible print quality","I can hardly begin to say how nice it is to have all these wonderful articles at my fingertips. Unfortunately, the print is practically illegible. It looks like the print from a typewriter ribbon that has been used much too long. The pictures are very grainy. Don't but this until you borrow a friend's set and see how it looks on your computer. I'm amazed that National Geographic is willing to sell it."
3,beauty is in the eye of the beholder i suppose,"a rather quaint story about honesty and religious values.to put it short and sweet:some boys (accidentally)break a little girl's blessed virgin statue,boy ""removes"" statue of st.francis of assisi from a rectory closet(boy leaves $ there instead)to give to the girl...girl returns the statue to rectory,boy explains it all to everyone-no harm done-all is well in the end.(the title refers to the statue of st.francis holding a bird in his hand.)"
4,Like good old times,This DVD is a memory lane for me. I was like 12 or so when this show was on. Who could forget the VAMP sketches. I love it.
1,Very cheap cable,"I wouldn't say this is cheap in price considering the quality. It should have been $1.99. Severe ghosting on a Gateway VX1120 through a LinkSys PS2KVM4 switch running two DELLS, and two GATEWAYS with two machines running SUSE LINUX. Horrible reception for every single machine. What a waste of money."
5,prairie memories,"This book is a must for anyone who was born or raised in the rural areas of north central united states. It was well written and somehow seems to remind us all of our youth and the memories that go along with our childhood. It has many funny and serious moments. It was great reading and hard to put down, once one started on it. Hopefully the author will followup on with another book that is as good or better."
4,Good Quality,"Good quality academic planner with each month spread out across 2 open pages. The soft grey-blue print is nice and neutral and plenty of space in the box to write in notes/appointments. The cover is nice and thick as are the interior pages, so it does not tear easily. Back/front few pages have holidays, time zones, space for contacts and a calendar for the next 2 years. Free Super-Saver Shipping sold it for me, although I wished it was a little less than $13+ to purchase."
2,Not what I expected,This planner is in a spiral bound extremely cheap cover and back. Flexible and could easily be damaged when in a bag with other books. The only thing I like about it is that it has only the months and it is not a weekly planner. The price is way too high for this dollar store quality that shouldn't be over $3.00 at the most. I am going to continue looking for one I like.
3,Good Power but poor cut,"I do a great deal of comparison shopping before I settle on a tool. I bought this based on DeWalt's reputation and my experience with their biscuit joiner and a circular saw. This jig saw is great if you're looking for something heavy duty with good power. However, if the quality of the cut is important to you, this saw has a defect. No matter what type of blade you put on it or how much you adjust the shoe, the cut will angle from the top surface of the board to the bottom. I tried to correct this, but to no avail. I finally resorted to rough-cutting with this tool and following with a router pass to make the edge 90 degrees to the face. I recently purchased a Freud for ...more than I initially paid for the DeWalt to replace it."
5,Dragon Ring,I bought this ring for my daughter's birthday; my daughter just loves it and all of her friends comment on how great looking it is; this is a very unique high quality ring. Silver Insanity provides great service and expeditious delivery to its customers.
4,Not a bad little camera,"Loaded with complete ease on my Windows XP computer. 5 minutes of set-up time and I was ready to go. It's not great with real low light, but turning on a couple of lamps does wonders. The picture quality is fantastic for [the price]and the frame rate is surprising as well. If you have a broadband connection, your friends will be amazed at how smooth the video stream is, especially when you tell them how much you paid for it."
3,OK BUT NOT GREAT FOR PRICE,The web cam is ok. You need to use either the utility in the inluded bundle or xp's own (hit the camera's capture button from the desktop)to adjust for backlighting. Camera says 640 X 480 30 frames per second high quality - BUT ITS NOT!!!! At 640 X 480 quality drops significantly and forget 30 fps. This is a cheap solution - and as Grandpa used to say -&quot;You get what you pay for....&quot;
5,Love this CD.,"I am very, very pleased with this CD. He sings like an angel. I love all the songs. This was recommended by a friend of mine and I would recommended it myself.Amore"
1,Not worth the money,I own(ed) one of these for about 5 years (mostly sitting in the garage). I only used it very lightly (still on the first blade!). I only used it for cutting 2x4 and particle board for shelving.Just recently the armature blew on it ... in the middle of cutting 5/8 particle board. Stopped dead in its tracks. I could not believe that it died with such little use. A High end saw just should not die like this!!!<P...My first and last Dewalt Saw. YMMV
1,Junk Saw,"We bought this saw for some light home improvement work. Hardly ever used it the first year of ownership. The motor burned up after some very light work (2x4). After investing the money, i thought i might as well have it fixed. I took it to Indianapolis to have it fixed at the B&D there.(1 1/2 hours away). I used it twice. I just used it again last week, and the motor burned up again! It was plywood. I am looking at Skil and Milwaukee. I am not a contractor.(thank goodness)."
5,3-way rachet set,"This was a gift for my husband and he was very pleased with it. He has lots of tools, many of which sit idle, but this one has been used several times already."
4,Much better than the earlier review implies,"I don't understand the one-star rating the other reviewer gave this. It sounds just fine to me, and has a number of tracks that are quite hard to find. As a certifiable Doris Day fan, I have to give it a much higher rating, and recommend it to other Day fans and fans of late-40's-early-50's music."
1,i actually got terrible leg cramps. I had to stop them after a week.,I developed severe leg cramps after taking these for a week. I must have an allergy to one or more of the ingrediants.
3,Maybe,"Bought ths for mom, she has been taking it for two weeks so far did not feel any difference, maybe it will improve her leg's viein in a longer time, weill see...."
2,a very loose interpretation,"This film is very hard to comprehend. If your looking for some live interviews and some interesting background into Aldous Huxley's life, this ain't for you. It does give you glimpses of interviews (all combined probably- 5 min)but it's soon interrupted with a bad combination of hard to follow commentary and dull visuals(no offense). Is not worth money."
3,"South park on DC, a waste of money, not if your a big fan","bad graphics, bad language, easy controls, spells F-U-N right out load! Just kidding, the game is fun, but you should only get it if you are a fan of the show!"
1,A very sad pathetic game...,"This game is actually fun-- for the first 5 times you try it. This game is much like a crude version of Jeopardy with small mini games that are like playing an old early 80's classic game. I am a big fan of south park but after about the 5th time playing it all the questions and mini-games get dull due to the fact that you have already seen and done them before. There really is no point to this game as points arent worth anything and most of the time you will be playing by yourself, even with a score of -9000 you will still win no matter what. A very slow paced trivia game with no replay value and nothing but constantly waiting for it to load the next question. Avoid this one at all costs."
1,Bulky and doesn't work,"Truely a waste of money. Takes up a bunch of space on my desk. The mouse goes through batteries every 3 weeks. I don't know how, since the mouse doesn't actually DO anything! The keyboard intermittently responds to my keystrokes, but it makes up for it by randomly repeating spaces in documents (even when I'm not typing). The keyboard has a wonderful feature that enables it to paste screen shots into documents automatically -- even when I'm simply trying to cut and paste text! Don't waste your money or time."
4,A Slam Dunk for Michael Graves Electronics,"After being disappointed with the Michael Graves Computer Speakers, I was pleasantly surprised by the fine performance of the Wireless Keyboard and Mouse set. The components were a breeze to install and have worked wonderfully. They don't have quite the range of Logitech's wireless peripherals, but at half the price they deliver well. Unlike another reviewer, I have never had any difficulty using the mouse and keyboard simultaneously even when both were set to the same channel. The keyboard has a nice crisp feel and the mouse works as well as any trackball mouse I've used.(I would have rated this at 4 1/2 stars if half stars had been an option.)Pros: Great price, wireless convenience and smart good looks.Cons: Unavailability of optical mouse, slightly limited reception range and very difficult package to open (really) (an electric knife could be useful here)."
2,Disapointing compared to Shaun Tan's works,"I am a great fan of Shaun Tan, and that's the main reason I bought this book, even though it did not look very promising.In the beginning the book slightly remindsThe Lost Thing, which is a masterpiece, one of the most beautifully illustrated and deep books. However, as the story develops, it becomes darker and, what is worse, meaningless. I could not find any lesson in the book.Of course the drawings are good, Shaun Tan is always great. However, compared to his creations it is way less than expected.I would highly recommend the books written AND illustrated by Shaun Tan, they have no flaws. Look forThe Red Tree,The Lost Thing, andThe Arrival, they are extremely beautiful and deep books."
5,The best energy gels ever used/tasted.,"Recommended to me by an experienced Marathoner; I just tried this amazing product while running 20 miles. VEREDICT: This Green Apple PowerBar Energy Gels are delicious, easy to swallow, very light on a dry mouth while running, (no need to drink liquids immediately to help it pass), non sticky, all contents come out easily. Amazing energy, zero cramps, perfect stomach sensation...Will buy a box of them. Need I say more?"
1,WHO HIRES THESE DVD PRODUCERS ANYWAY ?????,I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE ARE A SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED DVD CONCERT PRODUCERS OUT THERE. BECAUSE IF THERE IS I WANT A JOB. I COULD DO A BETTER JOB THAN THIS AND THE ARTISTS DESERVE MORE. I CANNOT BELEIVE THAT MB20 WOULD LET THIS BE RELEASESED AS IT IS !!!!!!THE CROWD NOISE IS OVERPOWERING SO MUCH SO THAT IT IS VERY HARD TO ENJOY THE CONCERT. I'VE BEEN TO OVER 400 CONCERTS IN THE LAST 50 YEARS AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD A CROWD THIS NOISEY.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON THIS DVD.
3,GREAT concert......NOT-so-great sound....,"The entire package is great! The 2nd disc gives you a VERY informative view into the life of Matchbox Twenty, and NOT just Rob Thomas. But it's the concert that I bought the DVD for, and it didn't make par. If you listen to the concert in 5.1 Dolby Surround it sounds excellent. However, when you listen to it in stereo(which is offered on the audio options) it sounds horrible. The songs are performed great, but the volume and vocals from Rob Thomas fade in and out.Unless you have a superb 5.1 surround stereo system, don't get it. The TRUE mb20 fan should get it for the 2nd disc, but NOT the concert. The average fan should stay away."
5,Superb Concert! Superb DVD!,"I love this DVD! I've read some of the reviews complaining about the sound but I have no idea what they're talking about. I don't have a fancy DVD player or a stereo system and my TV is at least ten years old. I have many different concert DVDs for many different music groups and this one, by far, has the best sound quality of them all! While watching it, I feel like I am in the arena with the band. The lyrics are very clear and the rhythms exhilarating. The picture quality is very good as well, although the cameras do choose some, shall we say, ""interesting"" angles at times.I think this is a wonderful DVD and money well spent. I recommend it to any and all fans of the electrifying music of Matchbox Twenty. Even if you're not a fan now, I think you'll become one after experiencing this DVD."
2,It's not all that :( really,This cd wasnt all that. I was expecting more of a mix compilation not jus single tracks. Their is about 2 good tracks on it.So its like I listened to it a couple of times now its collecting dust.But a dj can save it buy using a couple of it tracks on their mix.
2,The Flatter The Better,"I purchased a set of these for my 2008 Toyota Tacoma. The 21"" passenger side wiper works great but the 22"" driver's side misses about 4"" of the upper windshield at the end of the wiper's stroke. It's a pick-up truck. The glass is almost flat with just a slight curve but the wiper can't handle it. It's a premium product but can't do what it was intended to do. These aren't the wipers you're looking for. You can go about your business."
5,Surprisingly good,"While wasting time at work I came across the Sweatshop Union website and downloaded a couple of songs to check out. I listened to Union Dues and Don't Mind Us and immediately called a record shop and bought the album. ""Don't Mind Us"" is a commidical song about people the group don't like. It has got to be the best song on the album. I especially like the end when the Innocent Bystanders go off on people who where silver shirts and how vexed these people make them. Feelin' Alright has got a tight piano riff in the back reminiscent of Charlie Brown. Blue Collar Ballad is another good track about the typical Office Space boss. This is a complilation CD with five different rap groups on it, and I hear they're all from Canada, but even so, the CD is still tight. If you like underground hip-hop, you'll definately like this album."
2,"Got rid of scratch, left other marks","I am a big fan of Meguiar's products and have used them for years. I am not a detailing pro but I take pride in keeping my car in good condition and have use a lot of different products over the years. I noticed a light scratch on my black 2010 Altima Coupe and decided to try Scratch X 2.0, which removed the light scratch but left a light haze/ swirl marks that were very visible in sunlight, I had to use another product from another company to remove the haze and swirl marks.I would not use Scratch X 2.0 again, maybe it was worse because its a black car and lets face it black is horrible to keep clean."
5,AMAZED!!!!!!!!!,"I bought a used 2009 silver G6 and on the inner part of the drivers handle, there were surface scratches from a woman who must of had long nails. It was the one thing that really stuck out to me when it was sunny. They were off color and looked hideous. I decided I'd try this out after reading some of the reviews and it did everything plus better. I thought it'd just take it away a little bit, but as I buffed the scratches were literally disappearing from sight.I can't say this would work on a car that was keyed, or severely messed up, but for scratches on the surface, this product works wonders."
1,"Sorry, but did not work for me AT ALL. Time, money and calorie waste.","As title says - waste of time, money and calories. I have 08 BMW 335i Sport. Silver color. Have long scratches similar to those that guy posted in product images. Spent almost an hour, tried all different techniques. This product simply doesn't work. If you have a new car with nice paint, I would avoid buying this. It might work for some old cars which paint is in different condition, but not for me - sorry.P.S: I bought a full set of Meguiar's paint care, you can find my reviews on other products as well. What actually worked for me (somewhat) is Ultimate Wax and Clay Kit (contaminant removal kit), Clay Kit is very hard to apply though, but it works."
4,Worked Good on my Keyed Car,"Unfortunately had my car keyed deep with a curse word. Some of the letters were too deep to get out, but ScratchX did manage to remove some of parts of the lettering so that the word is not legible.ScratchX WORKS great to remove light scratches on the paint, but on some of the deeper scratches it just did okay. So if you have light scraps on the side of the doors ScatchX will get those out, but if you have deep scraps like deep keyed car scraps then don't expect that to disappear. Overall for the cost of the product at $7-10 dollars at your local autostores this is one of the best Scratch ""removers"" to use. It's effective and easy to use. Remember ScratchX isn't a miracle cure, but it's darn close to it.TIPS: Apply and remove several coats to clear out the scratches. Some elbow grease will go along way to helping get those scratches more blended."
1,scratch x,"i tried it on a superficial scratch, and kept rubbing the product several times, and reapplied 3 time and scratch is stil there, i tried it with foam pad, microfiber pad, microfiber towel, worst product meguairs produce."
1,Bad product,This product made the tiny scratches in my car more visible. I don't recommend it at all. I followed the instruction step by step but the result was so disappointing.
1,Just plain didn't work for me.,"I purchased a used car and it has some scratches. I thought this might help but honestly I don't see any difference at all. Followed directions and spent a lot of time and effort but the scratches are no less visible. I can feel the scratches with my fingernail, so maybe they are just too deep for this to work. So, sorry to say I'm quite disappointed in the product. Perhaps it would work with very minor scratches."
4,Rip Fence guide,"Sturdy works great, needs to be listed to show that it fits the eight and a quarter inch saw model"
2,Didn't fit my B&D CS1030L,"Description says it fits most B&D 7-1/4 models, but it certainly doesn't fit mine. Just a few MM too wide..."
5,Great upgrade for your Dewalt saw,"Fits perfectly on my corded Dewalt 369 7.25"" circular saw. I've read some reviews that it will not fit on the cordless variety.Helps to make smooth cuts, although it cannot entirely replace a table saw.Adjusts to allow you to shave very small amounts off the side of your piece (i.e., shaving 1/8"" off a door to make it fit).Dewalt should ship these with every saw they sell!Maybe mine was an exception (I got it from Amazon Warehouse Deals), but it was made in the USA."
5,Beautiful,"Beautifully written, deeply researched, this book deserves a few hours from the attentive reader. For the nonhistorian, this book offers many surprises and insights into the roots of the Progressive movement in the United States."
1,dissappointed,the saw blade came as expected but the blade has no carbide teeth and is basically useless after a few cuts. this detail was not prevailent in the advertisement.
1,So Poorly Written neither of us could plow through it,"Did the author get paid by finding and using the most obscure words to describe his thoughts? If so, he was a success. Run on sentence after run on sentence; so many obscure words that my iPod's dictionary was screaming ""Leave me alone""! The most boring book I've read in a very long time to the point after dragging myself through about 30 pages HAD to give up. The subject matter is very interesting - the author's descriptions and writing style unreadable."
5,i like it,"i recently bought this cam with in the last week. since my previous cam had broke, i was pleasantly surprised by the wide range of motion you can do with the cam as well as with the hi resolution picture it produces. my friends agree that for such a low price it is really user friendly as well a great buy. all in all, this cam is a great buy."
3,Pretty but...,"Very pretty ring. The etching does show, but barely. I hadn't seen Titanium rings before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was hoping it would appear a bit more silver, or glowing. The ring finish is very dull, and sort of reminds me of old aluminum in color and reflection.But Hubby likes it, and thats what I was hoping for. It fits nicely, and although it wasn't quite what I was expecting, the finish of the ring is very nice."
5,great ring!,I purchased this ring to wear at work and couldn't be happier! It fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable. I've gotten many compliments on the ring as well!
5,Just perfect!,My husband and I couldn't decide what to get each other for Christmas. I found this ring and we both thought it would make the perfect gift. We each have one and they are the most comfortable rings. His wedding band is a comfort fit so he was familiar with the way this ring fits. I have never had anything with a comfort fit band so it took a little getting used to but I just love the way it fits. The band is so smooth! I was very pleased with how easy it was to communicate with the people at Silver Insanity. They responded promptly to my emails and answered all my questions. I will glady buy from them again.
3,Not quite that bad....,"While I agree that this double CD is pretty poorly presented and packaged (which is unfortunate given the cost), it does have some different songs than the original Bway cast (e.g. the reprise of ""Hey Somebody"") and the cast includes folks like Harry Groener (best known for ""Dear John"" but also an experienced Bway singer/actor). There is absolutely no question that the original Bway cast is better performed, better packaged, and a better value -- BUT if you like that CD and want to explore the show more, you will find something of interest here."
1,No Results from this product. Waste of Money..,"I had pretty high expectations for this product. If you've seen the info mercials, they make it sound like one 10 minute session and your teeth will be pearly white. Unfortunately that's not the case. After reading the directions they actually recommend using it in 3 sessions of 10 minutes, and they also say, you may need to purchase refill kits to achieve the maximum result. I personally used it as directed and saw no difference in my teeth at all. In my opinion it was a waste of 20 bucks and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,you get what you pay for,"after reading other reviews, I went ahead and bought this blade to cut 3/4 inch birch plywood for some cabinets. Despite using a blade lubricant and coolant, setting the blade to the proper depth, and using an appropriate rate of cutting, the blade consitently fried the wood. It would bind in the cut, and more pressure would angle the saw and chew up the cutting guide I had made (*&%$#!!!). I finally went back to the blade that came with my Milwaukee circ saw, and when I used it with the guide ( a straightedge screwed to 1/2 inch plywood to support the edge of the 3/4 ply), I actually got better cuts. It worked OK for cutting 1/2 inch A/C ply. Iwould recommend this blade for cutting THIN plywood over short distances, but for ripping 3/4 inch plywood, it was utterly useless. I'd love to know what the reviewers who gave it good marks were cutting, and how they were doing it."
3,Eh..,"This book is full of information. It is, however, missing some key formulas needed to do some of the problems (there is a formula about energy density in blackbodies that I needed to get from another text). Additionally, the math becomes almost impossible to understand without a very good base in calculus."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I bought this wireless keyboard and mouse strictly because of it's low price... but I'm paying for it now.First off, the mouse is awful. It does not work after a couple of months. I cleaned it, tinkered with it, but could not get it to work properly. The pointer still kept skipping all over the screen. I had to upgrade to a Microsoft wireless mouse.I'm still using the wireless keyboard, but I'm about to upgrade it too. It works ok, but honestly it's not vey good. The software included with the keyboard is awful. It does not let you customize the keyboard and I can't find a software upgrade for it anywhere.My advice is spend a little more for a better quality keyboard.Buyer Beware!!!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I had this set installed only a few minutes when it started having problems. First, the hot button for the calculator does not work. Since this was one of the main hot buttons I was looking for, I was rather displeased.Second, the mouse never worked properly. Specifically, it won't move to the left. It's almost as if the ball inside is not big enough to make contact with the rollers that control the movement. The only way to make it go left is to swing it quickly left so the ball is thrown against the roller. This is not good for your wrist as it induces aches rather quickly! And,not being able to move left is rather unproductive when using a mouse.I contacted the customer service for Jasco products (the maker who distributes it under the GE brand) and they said the problems sounded like a hardware problem and to return the item. Come to find out after reading other reviews on this site, others have had this same problem, so I don't think it's just the keyboard and mo"
2,Wish I had my money back!,"I recently purchased this piece of junk from Target and I threw the box away thinking that it being a product made by General Electric that I wouldn't have any problems with it. Was I ever wrong,the mouse works good enough, and so does the keyboard until I put my computer into stand-by or sleep mode and then no matter what I do, it will not make my system respond, so I have to hit the reset button. It is scary what they call an owners manual, all it really does, is tell you what came in the box, not how it works or what to do if it doesn't work. Spend the money and get Microsoft, its worth it in the long run, buy right the first time and you don't have to buy again!"
1,Worst keyboard on market,I recently installed several keyboards for a client. They didn't but two weeks with problems Strongly recommend not to buy.
1,Is this American or Korean?,It states American and shows korean label BIG difference. Not the same herb. One star because error in advertising. American Ginseng has had many clinical trials and does appear beneficial for fatigue.
1,Wireless Garbage,"I have a wireless trackball at home made by Logitech that I love. I needed a new mouse at work, so I picked this one up based on my previously wonderful experience with wireless input devices. For a month it was great. Since then, the batteries seem to die every two weeks. My logitech trackball goes about 6 months before I need to change the batteries. I'm amazed at how fast this things chew up batteries. After 2.5 months and 4 battery changes, I'm going to buy a logitech trackball."
4,Works as advertised,"After reading a few reviews, and weighing the price vs value, I decided I'd give it a try. Besides, I was purchasing another item on Amazon and wanted to take advantage of the free shipping. It shipped separately and arrived much faster than estimated and was not very well packaged. Really??? A prominent mail order company that hasn't mastered the art of packaging? None the less, it arrived undamaged and all the feet were intact. It holds 4 - 5 bananas very well without bending and as for touching the fruit below, I guess that all depends on how much fruit you put in the bowl. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
4,"Helpful, but not too helpful.","The book is fine, and it is good to have around. But don't expect it to have literally every possible form of every verb, because it doesn't. Actually, it's somewhat rare that I find in this book the forms I've been running across as I translate Euripides' Hecuba. Optimistically, maybe the ones I happen to try to look up just happen to be the few the book doesn't have. But that doesn't seem very likely, does it?"
1,"""Some"" Ancient Greek verbs","All of you that are learning Ancient Greek know that one of the main problems with translating the texts is to recognize what is the basic form of the verb (the one you can find in Ancient Greek - ""your language"" dictionary). But I have to worn you that this book does NOT consist of all verb forms of all Ancient Greek verbs! It was obviously written for a specific course where they only use texts that have these forms of verbs. For others better and more complete editions of Ancient Greek verbs can be found."
3,The Quality School,Good overall concept. Rather redundant and begins to feel like overkill after awhile. This book doesn't offer much in the way of example - has it really been put into practice with success? Not sure because it's more preaching than showing.
4,Great theory on educational reform,"An educational consultant recommended this book for me as I was looking at some ideas for changing processes at my school. I think Glasser presents some great ideas, however, I found that one fundamental piece was missing, parental responsibility. Schools can not be solely responsible for the rearing and education of children. While I think Glasser's ideas are excellent for working with motivated children, I'm not convinced that behavioral suggestions would work with children from all backgrounds."
4,Mobile workhorse,"(Disclaimer: this review is based on the Qtek9090, a OEM version of this unit)Recommended. As a laptop replacement it doesn't meet the mark, but as a mobile workhorse, in airports and on the road it gets the job done. Mine gets primary use as a mobile e-mail system (using the Good technology push-mail solution), which it does perfectly.High marks for usefullness, low marks for battery endurance (and I don't use it as a mobile phone at all!). An additional plus is the abundance of software available for it, in stark contrast to my previous mobile workhorse, the Nokia 9500. I do however miss a USB-Host possiblity (I'd love to be able to use my USB sticks with it)."
5,"If You Really Want To Learn The Harmonica, Buy This Book!","Sometime in the mid-80's, I took a delivery job with a small company. I had alot of time on my hands between deliveries; to break the tedium, I decided to learn to play the harmonica. Fortunately, I came across ""The Natural Blues/Country Harmonica"". Of all the books for beginner harp players, this is by far the best. Without taking himself too seriously, the writer lulls the student into a calm, relaxed approach to playing the harmonica, which is perfect for this instrument. With the helpful illustrations and clear instructions, students new to the harmonica will find they can play with confidence before they even realise how much they have learned. This is a must buy as a gift for young harpists, or if you are giving a beginner their first harmonica."
2,Definitely not what you might expect.,"Fans of Christian Vander beware. This Magma has nothing to do with the French band of the same name that started the Zeuhl craze. This Magma is a pop band from Poland, playing a style of music much like you might have heard in America during the 80's. Not bad, of itself, but definitely not what I was looking for."
5,"excellent, but not without flaws","the trigger was an easy install, but there was one little hitchfor me, i found that the double trigger piece was in the way of the safety mechanism just a little bit. i shaved 1/16 of plastic off the inner item where it was blocking the safety knob, and it worked perfectly.and excellent item. highly recommended."
5,Muffler review,Ordered muffler. Recieved it in a timely manner. Good product. Have been with the Walker brand for many years.
5,It Hit me Like a Ton of Bricks,"This is the author's first book and it is truly an amazing biography. In fact after reading it I purchased a copy for each of my (grown) daughters! It's an important book in that it depicts the tug and pull between mothers and daughters as they grow in their relationships with each other. It's real; it shows the pain and the worry and the acceptance of their quirks. I especially love their honesty of feelings even when things aren't ""pretty"".It's a beautiful story; I hope the author continues to write. Her sensitivity and depth are striking."
1,"Gasp! Oh my God! We've made the worst ""Howling"" sequel!","""Look Jeb! Them there flimin' people are gonna make a picture in our favorit bar!"" Hmmm... the director must have chugged a gallon of moonshine left around the bar. There's absolutely no other way anyone could make such a dull, stupid movie. What's the deal with the redneck square dances and drinking scenes? Oh wait, let me take a sip of Farmer Whitey's best moonshine so I can get a better view of this ""unique"" perspective. I mean come on. A total disgrace to ""the Howling."" There IS NO BEST SCENE BECAUSE THEY ALL BITE THE SAME AMOUNT. Here, take an example. ""The guards' guns are loaded with silver bullets."" Really? Where did they get them? Or do all rednecks have silver bullets at home. Mr. Fanatical Reverend? The ""guards"" are drinking on the job! Honestly, everyone has a thin personality and a drinking problem. Oh, and the werewolf is a blur with a yellow T-shirt. Any questions?"
1,HOWLING VII NEW MOON RISING.TERRIBLE.,"Howling 7 put me to sleep,nothing scary,not even entertaining. it has really bad country music,not Johnny Cash or Real Country/the good stuff but horrible music.I watched it elsewhere,I wouldn't even rent it and Thank God I Did not.where's the wolf? Half the movie is dancing? The cover might look it,but the movie is so terrible I would give A Negative 0.not a 1 star If I Could. Thankfully this is the last of the mediocre franchise of The Howling and each preceding Horrible Sequel.(Parts 2 and 4,6-The Rebirth/castle one is good but not too ""Horrifying"" or Horrorlike and Part 1 is really more Suspense than a Horror movie). If you want to see a Scary Werewolf Movie with a Mean Looking not Skinny Wolf or ""real wolf"" Then See An American Werewolf In London(not the Remake) and pass the Howling and Wolfen over."
3,Great MP3 player but lousy tuner...,"As an MP3 player, this product is a great deal. 32MB plus bass and treble make for a terrific MP3 listening experience. However, the FM tuner is pitiful. Both the sensitivity and selectivity are horrible, so only the strongest stations come in then only within a certain distance where other stations aren't interfering. It's totally useless for weaker stations. My old Sony FM Walkman is much, much better."
1,almost the worst mp3 player!,"UPSIDES. Low price, small design. DOWNSIDES. Very bad display. it only tells you the time elapsed and the track number. also, although it says it comes with 32 MB of memory, it actually comes with 2 16MB discs, which means that you always have to carry the extra cartridge with you, and only 6 songs at a time! also, this player drains batteries very quickly. i replaced this I-Jam with the rio.. dont waste money on this thing that you will end up replacing anyway."
5,Worth the Price of Admission,"I enjoyed all the films in this volume. Some might not be what most would refer to as classic Film Noir, but this volume is well worth checking out anyway. The stories are interesting, they are directed well and the lighting is often what one would expect from Noir. The TV in the bar in Dial 1119 was a surprise to see (For those who have not seen the film, you're probably not sure what I'm talking about. Watch the film to find out)."
3,"Some of these movies are definately not ""true"" film noir films.","WE liked several of these movies, but we don't think the entire set is worth the money.We have collected film noirs for all our lives and they are definately our favorite film catagory. But several of these are just horrible and hardly the type of film noir that we enjoy and have come to love over the years. Sorry we cannot list the ones that were bad, as it's been several months since we watched the movies. In fact we pretty much just shut several of these movies off in the middle. In summary, don't think you will enjoy all of these movies- but maybe you will and it's just us."
2,NOT Original Aspect Ratio,"This review isn't about the movie, which is great. It's about the DVD. While I can't vouch for the other movies in this set, I have seen ""The Phenix City Story"" from this set. It is, as everyone says - Widescreen. However, the movie was shot in Full Screen - NOT widescreen. I have the original recorded from TV to prove it. Comparing them side-side, it's easy to see the difference. They cut the top and the bottom off to make this widescreen version. I would much rather see the entire move without the top and bottom cut off. The same thing happened to Psycho. That wasn't originally widescreen either."
3,NO COMMENTARIES-very unhappy,"There are no commentaries to any of these noir flicks. It is extremely sad because people like Alain Silver, Eddie Mueller,Roger Ebert ,etc. add other information and insights that you could not possibly get by just watching the movie.This is the first Warner set that does not have this added feature and I truly feel cheated. Being the first review I have ever written and most likely my last, I was really looking forward to watching these great movies again with a film historian discussing little known facts and interesting aspects of each movie that would never be uncovered with just another viewing. C'est la vie!!"
4,do you like action then you sould read this book,What i like about the city in the clouds was all the cliff hangers . The cliff hangers make you read more it is intersting and it is very short so it is easy to read for a book report like i did. It is similar to other droon books. If you like actoin books then this is the book for you. Ther was a really good actoin part when sparr got his big army and tried to get the city but the kids stop him.
2,Drakan=Disappointing!~~,"I got this game for Christmas, thinking it would be really great, I love Dragons and I like fighting with swords. This game was EXTREMELY boring. I'll have to admit, it seemed really great at first, until I got to the second world and saw that I'll I'd be doing was trying to figure my way in and out of caves and slash only 3 different types of creatures. All it was was having blood all over the place and being bored to death! Even...dare I say it, Sim games are more fun! :("
2,DE-bunking is the key,"This is a great book if you need to know what NOT to believe. Wilton has done his research disproving almost every belief and internet-passed-along linguistic phrase and urban legend.The problem is, he doesn't risk making a statement about where each phrase definitively came from, or even a strong opinion pointing in that direction.It's just: ""nope, less than probably, nobody knows, maybe, absolutely nope, unlikely, extremely unlikely, and laughable"".Very informative, but mostly spineless and less than satisfying. I hate the thought that we will need to pay more money for a book that has real conclusions. A little more bunking would be nice."
3,Ok,"Enjoyed it. Did not want or write too many words, but amazon wants at least twenty, so here there are."
2,Boring,I have enjoyed many books by Kristin Hannah and was excited to read this one. I was very disappointed. This book was slow and dragged along without ever picking up speed. This entire book could have been captured in a few chapters. A little too boring for me.
1,Cliched story of a 50s era marriage,This book made me angry. Why do women write books that encourage women to be OK with bad behavior? Let's see if you can guess the answers to these questions: Who acts like a jerk and a liar? Hint: The man. Who puts up with the jerk and the liar? Hint: The woman. Who is subtley blamed for the man's bad behavior by staying home with her kids instead of traipsing all over the country with a glory seeker? Hint: The woman. How does it end? Let's just say that I disagree with the author's own statement in the reader's guide that says this book is a love story. Not any kind of love any young woman should yearn for.
5,helpfully insightful from start to end,A helpful insight movie to get us to understand him morehis life morehis movies morehim in generaland just enjoy itsure he wasn't in itbut it's still greati'll always have this dvd to watch if I ever want to remember something memorable about him. like his role in Green Hornet which I will get on dvd someday.
5,SENSATIONAL!!,"The thing that most amazes me about Wayne Shorter is that, unlike some aging artists who reach a certain plateau and remain stagnant, he continues to improve. At certain points on this album, I think he sounds better than I've ever heard him. His tenor solo on the new-ly revised 'Orbits' is a palette of various colors that, together, form a picture of beauty. The wonderful 'Bachianas Brasileiras No.5' is a classical-jazz arrangment that shows off Shorter's range. The title track, 'Vendiendo Alegria', is a tune given to him by Miles who said, ""Do something with it."" Years later, he makes his mentor proud by what I think is the best song on the album. All in all, 'Alegria' is a wonderful effort by one of the best(if not the best) jazz composers in the world today."
3,"Ok, but the tires routinely go flat.","If you have a big honking Northstar generator, obviously wheels are a must, unless you plan to just set it in place and never move it.Mine gets moved a fair amount, and it weights over 400 pounds, so I went with the wheel kit.The wheels are OK, but they run low/flat every couple of months and need to be refilled. This can be a real pain if you pushed the generator into a corner where you can't get at the wheels to add air - a 400 pound deadweight on flat tires doesn't move easily.So, if you buy these, check the air in the tires every so often unless you feel like a test of strength and will the next time you need to pull the generator out."
5,"David and The Giants ""Angels Unaware Rocks!""","I saw the group back in the mid-nineties. It was my first Christian Rock concert, and the tour that featured this cd/tape/album/project. I bought the tape then, played it a lot, and went a long time without listening to it. I decided I wanted a copy of the cd. I ordered it and found that it was just as good as I remembered it from before. It has good rock tunes that I remember from the concert was a ""headbanger's delight."" It also has very well done soft songs with beautiful tunes. I highly recommend the cd for Christian rock fans. I hate the fact that the group no longer tours together."
5,Love it!,This is a must have for the Backyardigan fan! My 2 year old absolutely loves both CDs. I just wish they would come out with more cds with all the songs!
5,FALL INTO ME,"""FALL INTO ME"" is a very touching, sensitive healthy video which is a treat nowadays for viewing by the entire family. Funny, hilarious, meaningful, well-done, full of human emotion and love, with great special effects. One of the special effects was outstanding. Movie was very creative, well-written, well-directed and especially, well-acted. This movie shows the value of good communications between people, that life has lots of unanticipated and unexpected twists and turns, and that one should not always take things in life for granted. We gave this video as gifts for the holidays."
1,Hack Job,"I'm not sure what sycophantic suck-ups wrote these 5 Star reviews, but Fall Into Me is about as bad as they come. This movie fails on every level. Even the normally wonderful Ron Menzel looks confused. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge supporter of indie films, but not when they try to do everything in their power to be run-of-the-mill, cookie-cutter studio flicks that would maybe - MAYBE - fly as a high-concept/low-expectation Adam Sandler vehicle with 50 million dollars of Hollywood gloss to make me forget the lack of script, horrendous lighting and tragic hair-styles."
3,"Interesting, but derivative","While the book brings some unavailable stories to light, most are taken from books previously published that were adaptations already. Most unfortunate is a single illustration that is an exact copy of an illustration from an earlier collection of Pacific Legends."
4,Well done,"In ranking Joey's 3 solo releases, I would rank this #2 behind his 1995 debut ""a place to call home"", which I consider his greatest work ever, either as a solo artist and as the frontman of EUROPE. Very stong production. More guitar driven than ""a place to call home"" or ""azalea place"", yet still very introspective and mature. This is music that makes you think. THIS IS NOT A EUROPE ALBUM. This is Joey Tempest solo at his best. Give this album extra time to sink in and it will grow on you tremendously! The 2 bonus tracks are worth having, though the sound style is a departure from the rest of the album - making it clear why they were cut from the international release. My top three songs on the album are ""forgiven"", ""superhuman"" and ""always on the run""."
2,Dewalt Masonry Board Jig Saw Blades.,I bought these blades to do cut outs on fiber cement board siding. They only cut through about 20 inches of material before over heating and bending. They didn't last long at all. I can't say how well they will work for other material but do not buy them for cutting fiber cement siding.
5,Greatest FPS ever!,"WIthout a doubt the best first person shooter ever made. The graphics are superb, the sound blows you away, and the level design is truly a work of art."
4,"Quake: bigger, badder, bloodier; 3 words. Quake III","This game is the most advanced multi-player experience I have had to date. The graphics are stunning, the framerate on my Voodoo3 is very smooth, and the weapons are the best multi-player mix to date. The bad part about this game is the foolish AI. It's so incredably predicatble that even a mediocre player like me can defeat it. I also think that the game could do with less sloppy coding. The game expects to much from the computer you have, instead of using better code."
4,This is a real deathmatch !,"Ok lets get real. This is a ""up in the dreamskie"" game so if you hate somebody than you can pretend that he is 1 of the opponents. This game loose of stress & hate. Real graphics and real sound*. This game is ""only"" a multiplayer game so if you dont have the internet or you work an LAN than dont buy until you have the Internet ! Except you want to have less fun with the ""BOTS"" So you want this kind of game without using the internet then I recommend... Unreal & Unreal Tournament that is also an Internet game but you get more fun without the Internet on this game.Thank you*In the sound feature it needed more music so you could live into the GAME, enjoy!"
3,Unreal Tournament is better,From playing the test of Q3 and the demo of Unreal Tournament I'd have to say Unreal Tournament is the better game. It just feels better. This is a good game but Unreal Tournament is the one to buy.
3,Don't need a TNT or GeForce,"That's funny - I've got a Voodoo3 3000 and the game looks fantastic. However, it's missing something --- fun. The weapons are weak at best and the game generally feels like you're controlling a lead brick. Stay away from it - it's a proven fact that playing Quake 3 is detrimental to one's Unreal Tournament skills."
2,"If you're not into multiplayer, buy something else","I have eagerly gobbled up every release from Id since the Doom shareware demo, and loved every minute of the hours and hours of gameplay.But I hate Q3.Why?The game is designed *only* for multiplayer. Don't believe otherwise. The classic Doom/Quake format of exploration and level-solving is gone. Kaput. The single-player version just gives you an AI critter as a stand-in for a deathmatch opponent, which means that the gameplay consists of nothing more than running around a small, boring level as fast as you can while frantically shooting in all directions. It's totally lost the scary, creepy charm that really made Doom and the earlier versions of Quake stand out.Yeah, the graphics are great, and yeah, the AI critters are pretty smart, but the gameplay gets old really fast. If, like me, you don't give a damn about multiplayer gaming and you're looking for a *real* sequel to Q2, check out Unreal or Half-life. But don't bother with Q3."
1,Quake3 lacks in the gameplay area.,"If you have a fast network connection, a speedy high end system, and you like all eye candy and no game play then this is the game for you.The single player aspect of Quake 3 involves running around a small, poorly-contructed level trying to eliminate a ""bot"" before it eliminates you. The bot AI is pretty bad, more skillful bots just seem to put one through you with god-like accuracy every 5 seconds. As for multiplayer, unless you have a fast internet connection, you'll be lagged to hell and back, giving a someone who does ample time to put a rail through your skull..Mostly all of the weapons in q3 are the same from the previous quake games. The level design isn't half as good as q1 or q2. And what's with these models? Did I just see Tigger hop by? or was that pikachu? Where's C3P0? Give me a break, it's like watching a Dr. Who marathon or something.Overall, I'm disappointed in this game, I'd recommend Soldier of fortune or Unreal tournament."
4,No straight out of the box!,"ok ok, i belive that UT is a better game outa the box. i gto Q3a for christmas okay, maybe quake3 does sux abit out of tha box, but look all at the maps and mods for Q3A ther almnost none for UT. TWO WORDS: SUCK IT, buy Q3A forgot UT"
1,COOL!,BUY THIS GAME! BUY IT! IT'S SOOOOO COOL! THIS GAME CAN'T BE COMPARED TO UT! BECAUSE IT'S SO MUCH BETTER! BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!
4,A.Khan,"UNREAL IS HISTORY! Give it up! I have a PIII 500, a TNT2 Board and an SBlive soundcard and this game ROCKS AND RULES! BUT id could have done better if they had also developed a full version as well."
2,I don't have a cable modem!,"this game should marketed as a MULTIPLAYER ONLY!!!The graphics are gorgeous, however there is nowhere to explore and nothing to find.I only have a 56k modem - absolutely not fast enough. One has to have a super fast cable modem to play this ""deathmatch"" game online"
3,Game control is awful,"This might be an OK game (althought it does seem a little old-style in terms of visual effects) except for the game must be controlled entirely by the keyboard, and it is extremely unintuitive when compared to some other Star Trek games, like The Fallen. Advice: skip this one."
4,Innovating product that makes peeling a breeze,"I came by this item online and decided to check it out in person before buying. Guess what! I bought it on the spot. The peeler fis neatly in your hand, irrespective of the size of your palm. It is extremely easy to use and makes conventional peelers look like clumsy dinosaurs. One area for improvement is the blade itself: it could stand a little sharpening."
2,fingers beware,This peeler works great...maybe a little too great. I have sliced my fingers more times with this than any other peeler. Make sure you get a box of band-aids with this!
5,Thrush 24214 Glass Packs,"These glasspacks are great, look good, are well made and sound outstanding. Be sure to measure your exhaust pipe size when ordering to ensure a good fit. These pipes are 28"" long with 2 and 1/2"" inlet/outlet. My sons full size GMC truck had 2 and 1/2"" exhaust pipes and the fit was perfect. Just slide them on and weld ,No problem. A great price and quick shipping. Would be a good purchase to anyone looking for good quality glasspacks. They are well built heavy duty glass packs with a good sound."
5,Wow! More than George!,"Love, love, love this book. It shows not just about both Georges, but the history of America in an amazing way. I love now you see the British viewpoint as well as the Colonists. The illustrations are also equally great. We used the photos to help us understand some of the battles, and get a better understanding of the French and Indian war."
5,"100 Years of Oz, shows why we proudly collect Oz.","As a collector of Judy Garland and The Wizard of Oz for over 35 years, I can honestly tell you that this beautiful book takes me back to a time in my life when innocence prevailed. When there were Oz puppets attached to bottles of ""Joy"" and I begged my mother to buy the detergent. When Remco made that wonderful Showboat so that we could put on our own production of The Wizard of Oz. A time when the cutest glasses enticed you to buy peanut butter, even if you didn't like peanut butter. Those were happier times. Mr. Fricke and Mr. Carroll took me back to those happy, carefree, breezy days of my childhood, and now when someone asks me why I chose to collect on this subject, all I have to do is hand them this incredible book -- because the pictures speak louder and more clearly than any words ever could. It's stunning, and anyone who loves Oz and it's lure, will find this book irresistible! E. Willingham"
1,lost w/delorme,"Absolutely kaka for support unless you want to upgrade!!!!!!!They have convinced me to upgrade a couple of times with different programs, but not this time. My $100 topo usa dvd is now a Frisbee.... Where's my dog.... Here fido .... catch."
2,Poor Printing Options,"I found the software to be slow and have poor printing capabilities. I wanted digitized USGS 7.5' quads to print and use for offroad trips, but not with this software. Advancing to higher level of detail was slow and I had to go through each incremental increase. The largest map size for printing is 11x17 (I asked Delorme). You can select 2x2 or 3x3 mosiac prints, for manual assembly, but not what I wanted. I used the 30 money back guarantee."
2,A real dissapointment,"The first thing I noticed was the lack of contrast on the screen. It was very difficult to pick up roads, trails or streams. Next, I began looking for change in elevation along a stream, and was stunned to find water moving uphill. After about 2 hours searching for a reason to keep it, I gave up and sent it back."
2,"Great idea, bad writer.","The world was fascinating. The concept was fresh. The author should have put it into a short story. As it was he beat the reader to death with useless facts, backgrounds, and sidetracks to dead ends. The author did have some interesting writing conventions as he leapt the reader from one failed eigenstate to a successful one. This writer should be forced to write only short stories until he learns how to pace a full novel/novella."
4,Insufficient Ending,"I felt that this was a good book to read, but at times it tried my patience. Parts of the book that seem crucial at the beginning are never followed up on and that is kind of dissapointing. The story could flow a little more evenly as well. The ending leaves much to be desired, but the concepts and ideas that are presented make you wonder. I think it is a good read, just be patient through the boring parts."
1,Terrible,This book sucks. Its also not available for kindle. Also there's a description of a dinner and the food is terrible and the portions small.
4,"Not Perfect, But a Good Phone","The Samsung SGH-C207 is an all-around good phone if you can get it for $40 or less. I wouldn't spend over $50 on it though. I got mine through on online offer with Cingular for $30, and it was well worth that.Though the C207 doesn't have a speakerphone, I can hear the ring perfectly fine. The phone also includes some entertaining games but they could have done better with the ringtones, graphics, and wallpapers included.The Samsung C207 is very small and comfortable to hold. It's the same size (if not smaller) than my sister's Samsung flip phone when its closed. The only problem with this is the buttons are kind of small and close together if you have large fingers."
5,Wonderful,"I really liked the music on this album. The lyrics are well thought out and are full of heart. The song ""Maybe Tomorrow"" is one of my favorites. It reveals to the listener that you can still have dreams even when you haven't met that special person yet. They have a way to share many of the feelings that their listeners have. These guys are truely inspired by our Father and His love pures through their music. Truely Inspirational!"
2,Not a great layout and no pictures,"Not what I expected as far as a great guide book. I like photos so I have some ideas about what I am going to see. I know they can't take pictures of everything but a few pictures helps me in my decision and also gives an idea of what an area or an attraction looks like. The descriptions are OK, sometimes not enough information but I feel it could be better organized with maybe tabs for quick reference. Overall instead of buying one of these try to get the free travel guide from New Mexico tourist center or the AAA travel guide both are as good or better."
3,Good book,It was a good book but I didn't really learn anything new about myself. It was nice to see that I am not alone with my quirks.
5,Archeological evidence supports biblical truth,"There are two versions of this book, one with biblical references and one without. I read the version with biblical references. It appears this version is without. Walt Brown has done extensive research and includes hundreds of references in this book. He presents explanations of the circumstances following Noah's flood including formation of the Grand Canyon, the fossil record, coal seams, and much more. Additionally, the author exposes all of the missing information in the theory of evolution, showing how far fetched the theory really is. This book challenged my ability to think critically and pushed my faith in God and my respect of the Bible's truth to a much higher elevation."
1,Pseudoscientific claptrap,"For those who like creationist apologetics, this book is highly recommended. But for anyone who knows anything about science, this book is ridiculous. It is filled with typical creationist misquotes of famous scientists, misinterpretations, and outright falsehoods. All in the service of ""proving"" the Bible is the literal truth. Walt Brown should be ashamed of himself.It is amazing how many people fall for unscientific jibber-jabber like this. It speaks to the woefully poor science educations most Americans receive."
3,Coelho writes well,I didn't enjoy this as much as some of his others but it was interesting and thought provoking.
4,Entertaining but very simple,"I was a big Coelho fan after reading The Alchemist, which is a simple but deep story.Coelho writes very well, or at least the translations don't lose any of his prose, but I found the story to be a bit flat and preachy. If you have seen any Hollywood movies or read fairy tales, it is no more than they can offer. It was an easy book to read and entertaining, but did not leave me enlightened."
1,no surprise,"Even though I knew this book wouldn't reach The Alchemist I was very disappointed. If you know nothing about religion or if you haven't read different books like this then you might like The Devil and Miss Prym otherwise you will be very bored. The narration is very trivial, I had a feeling that the author thinks readers are stupid so he has to explain everything to them. Also the story is not strong enough."
5,As Advertised,It arrived on time and I was able to add the additional RAM to our church computer without issue. The RAM upgrade was successful and to this day our church PC is happy.
3,Enlightening,"I recommend every person to get into the depth and roots of the Indian culture. This is the most educating culture to the western man, this book deals with the speciality of the cultur in general and shows the importance of the remain Indians. The cruelty that has been customed toward the indians showing its ugly head everywhere, in and between the lines, with that we can ask the important questions, as the book does and replies with a mystical beautiful helpful answers. This book is about all of our minds and all of our spirits."
4,Great series,this is a great addition to the librarian series. my teenage son loves them. Great family show.
5,Love the series,If you have seen my other podst on on the Librarian: Soloman's mine you know I just love this series. It's a kind of Indiana Jones meets Warehouse 13. Great movies.
3,File in the derring do section,I was mystified by the YRV rating on this TV movie.Sort of pulp fiction for television this has a certain charm about it spoit only by the joins.A bit of judicious editing would not have gone amiss.If you yearn for a bit of yesteryear with Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power in swashbuckling tales then this is for you.A harmless bit of fun. Enjoy.
4,Almost perfect,"I would give this item 5 stars but the glue on the Velcro strap melted and the strap no longer sits where it is supposed to. I do live in Atlanta and we have had one of the hottest summers I can remember and maybe that's why the glue melted. It still performs the way it should which is to keep my steering wheel and my leather seats cool, it was a miserable experience getting into my car before buying this. I also like that I don't have to remove the GPS holder from my windshield, I just put the shield up and around it and it still works."
5,Love it!,"I bought this knife after watching Rachel zoom through all the prep for her 30 minute meals, hoping it would make my time in the kitchen a little less tedious. I wasn't disappointed!! This knife makes food prep so easy it's almost fun, lol! I highly recommend it for all the other amateurs out there!"
5,Rachael Ray East/West Knife,Best knife I've ever owned. Super sharp. Makes me feel like a professional! Love it!
2,I've had better,"I received 1 of these as a Christmas gift and liked it so much that I went back and bought a second. That was about 6 months ago, since then they have both gotten tiny rust stains. The handle on one is also coming loose and the orange rubber grip seems to be wearing away. The blade itself is not as sharp as I'd like it to be but it does get the job done. I will admit that I have been putting these in the dishwasher which is not the recommended cleaning method. I was able to get mine for $20 each instead of $50. Bed, Bath & Beyond had them half price and then I also had a 20% off coupon. For $20 knives I guess I'm not surprised that they've deteriorated but if I had paid $50 then I would be unhappy right now."
1,does not fit,The blade does not fit flush against the windshield of my 2000 accord. Had to return. Thank you amazon for the easy return.
3,Entertaining but loses its charm,"I was stunned by my first listen to 'England Made Me' The lyrics were some of the most disturbing I had heard and the sparse accompaniment created the appopriately depressing mood. Yes, if you're looking to go cry in your room and contemplate the cruelties of pop-culture and relationships, this is the place to come. Unfortunately, after the first few listens, the novelty wears off. The music itself is not sufficiently intriguing and the songs begin to sound too similar to each other. The singer doesn't stretch her voice enough, and the songs begin to sound underproduced. On the first few listens it didn't matter, just for the sheer uniqueness of their music, but on repeated listens you might find yourself gettting bored. Still, if you're feeling down, and want to go even deeper into depression and know that someone else out there feels like hell, go for it. Its Uniqueness alone earns it three stars."
1,The Advance SP is so much better,Before I got my Advance SP I mostly played my Color system. It doesn't even have a backlight like the Advance SP. I's have to use a stinken light when I play it and it also has horrible graphics. If your wanting to get a Game Boy for your son or daughter get the Advance SP.
4,GREAT!!,"I liked this thing. It played in color, but used up batteries fast. The sound isn't all that great (too quiet), and the screen scratches easily."
5,Parent Loves Gameboy Color,"My son received Gameboy Color and the 2 Pokemon games last Christmas. Finally, I tried playing it recently and got hooked myself! To make a long story short, I got my own GB and now play Pokemon with my son! Lot's of fun even for a 38 year-old Dad!"
3,Could be better.,"This is the first hand held color system but it has many things wrong with it. The screen is way to small to use, even though the color came out on it they made the graphics worse, U have to be in direct light to see the screen, and the sound is really annoying. Nintindo made the color but they made the screen smaller and the graphics worse. I like the older one better. Like the old one i love the games for it but the sound is not very good and the graphics r bad. It is also big and bulky so it weights a ton and its hard to put in ur pocket. This one could have been beter."
2,2stars,"This game system is kind of adiccting but not enough like x-box,ps2,gamecube, or nintendo64. My friend owns a Kiwi one and his brother owns a atomic purple. I decided to rate the kiwi(they are all the same except the color) because that is the one I played the most. Pros and cons of this product;**PROS**They are portible so you can take them on car trips(unlike bigger consoles).They have Pokemon games for those of you that AREpokemon fans.They come in a variety of colors;grape, kiwi, purple, ect.:( Cons ):The small screen can often be hard to concentrate on.The games are more like packman and arcade style games which I HATE(I like good 3-d graphic and adventure with horses).At night they don't light up(you can't see them)It must be perfect light in the place your playing to see some of the games.It can make your stomach hurt in the car(because your not looking were you are going.Grip is always comftorble.Note: All of the thing stated here are (MY) opionion and not expert derection."
3,GREAT GBC!,"I just want to say, that the Game Boy Color is great, but you have to sit somewhere were you have light right next to you. If you don't have good enough light, you won't really see the coloring. I am a little disappointed. And everybody used to say, that the GBC got bigger! I don't think so! The screen got smaller, and the game boy got thinner. Okay, the game boy is small enough to fit it into your pocket, but I still think it's a disappointment, I'm selling my Game Boy Color."
5,Doesn't matter much now...,"Okay if you asked me now I'd say go with Gameboy advanced. However, the price is right on Gameboy color, and it is still certainly still one of the best handheld systems. I had a lot of fun with the Poke'mon games, and also talking to gameboy for several hours a day. He'll make a fine companion to anyone living alone in the cold depths of endless solitude. 5 stars definately."
3,Missing product,I got it and it was in good shape except it had no back to it and the batteries fall out easily
3,Portable fun in color,"Game Boy Color was the most popular system for portable fun in color. Then one day in June 2001, the Game Boy Advance came along. The Game Boy Color felt so humiliated. The Game Boy Advance (GBA) has much better graphics, a wider screen, and longer battery life and better accesories. Ha ha GAme Boy Color. In June 2001, Nintendo attended the Game Boy Color's funeral. It commited suicide when GBA came out. ZI highyl recommend GBA to everyone. It like having a portable Sony Playstation with Nintendo 64 games."
3,Totally unnecessary.,"While this method should work fine, you absolutely don't need a special device to make s'mores. I just made some. All you need is any safe flame to toast the marshmallows.Remember, if you make s'mores with or without this silly gadget, that marshmallows are prone to catch fire. This may make them very tasty, but poses a safety hazard, so don't let children do this unsupervised."
4,Vintage BBC Doctor Who,"Episode 10, the second Doctor Who story dealing with the Daleks, is from the second season of the original Doctor Who series with William Hartnell, the first Doctor. This release is very well done, with video quality far better than expected from the ancient British 405-line black and white system. While BBC managed to lose many early Doctor Who stories by erasing the original tapes, this story survives in good condition. The commentary track is also quite informative."
4,The first companion to leave Dr Who,"This was well worth the wait! Some of the ""running through deserted London"" scenes drug on a bit, but for the most part, the action flowed at a good pace. The scene where Susan is left behind and the speech the Doctor makes at the end are classic!"
2,Tries too hard to prove its Keynesian case,"This book tries to prove the Gold Standard does not work. It should have considered the possibility from a monetarist point of view that the Gold Standard did not work because central bankers, rather than tens of thousands of gold-trading merchants, were controlling the flow of gold. As such, central bankers are prone to collusion and game theory takes over, rather than economic self-interest, which is the real reason IMO why the gold standard failed in the 1930s.But it is a useful book to highlight the blow-by-blow account of the failure of the gold standard (i.e., fixed money supply) in the 1930s Great Depression (which itself was caused by central bankers), if you read between the lines."
2,not that bright,not too pleased with this flashlight. I have other Pelican models that are better. The first one I rec'd was DOA...the metal piece that sits inside that makes contact with batteries was missing but I understand bad units can slip through. Amazon was good at sending me an exchange. This one works..but just not very bright..luckily it was not that expensive.
1,A waste of money...,"I bought this book believing some of the comments... Well, here's mine: It's a TOTAL waste of money, not to mention your time reading it!"
1,but I use a Mac,"Not everyone uses Windows 95, 98, NT or otherwise! What resource is available for Mac users? I enrolled in four classes at my local community college and will be forced to withdraw from every one because the texts and accompanying software are written only for windows! I grow very weary of the supriority complex of PC users. The single greatest improvement in PC technology in the past five years has been to make them look and function like MACINTOSH! Those of us who were there first shouldn't be discriminated against! (Can you tell I'm pretty cheesed off about this!) I'm no dunce. I've been doing some pretty sophisticated computer work for the last 7 years and I am deeply offended by the growing Mac exclusion."
3,Not well organized.,"The previous versions of this book (MS Access 2 and MS Access 95 Step-By-Step) were EXCELLENT. This version is not well-organized. Topics are scattered about the book. This book superficially introduces complex topics, such as macros in an introductory-level book. It is confusing to the student. I have used this and the previous versions for teaching courses over the past 4 years. I beg the authors/publishers to please go back to the same organization and content style as the previous versions."
1,Don't buy this book !!,"Too superficial. Tells you WHAT to do, but not HOW or WHY. Useless -- even for the beginner. Unless you happen to work in a candy store, this book isn't for you!"
4,"Clear, Simple, an easy, low cost book .....","I read and used this book cover to cover. It was almost sufficient enough to allow me to pass my exam. I did use another MSPRESS book for more hardcore reference. The exercises are fun, and if it was not for the minor mistakes in the book I would rate it 5 stars. Look to the MSPRESS site and check under support for the corrections...print it out to view the minor problems for yourself. Overall a great book...don't bother with Exam Crams A97 ""WASTE OF TIME"" book...this is the better deal! Good luck!!!!"
3,"""They have an appetite beneath the Ground!!""","""Frontios"" is really surprisingly good. Not quite as wonderful as ""Logopolis"" & ""Castrovalva"", but still, very enjoyable. The sets and design are great, with exception of the Tractators feet(they have none! I know, there giant earthworms, so to speak). Mark Strickson's performance is pretty good, when he isn't way OTT and frothing at the mouth. The Gravis' reaction when the Doctor shows him the console room(what's left of it)really stands out. Nice use of desperate colonists, as well. With the exception of some silly acting, ""Frontios"" is a successful Davison outing."
1,Certainly NOT the J2EE Bible !!!,"This book covers many topics, unfortunately it does not go into great detail on any of them. I don't know what the author was trying to do with this book, but I do know that this is not the new J2EE bible as some of the other reviewers have stated. Some of the topics covered have nothing to do with J2EE, they are project management topics.If you are looking for a real J2EE book look elsewhere."
1,REALLY?,"This mailbox, as sturdy as it appears, actually isn't. It took two grown men to figure out how to get the key, instructions and rest of pedestal out of the mailbox. Even though it was achieved, we also broke the mailbox in turn. After putting the mailbox back together, it wasnt that hard.By the way, it is suggested that you get 80 lbs of cement to pour a slab. It is not like you dig a hole and put the pole in it."
4,i loved it...until someone stole it,"I'm on here to try and find a new mojo 1, because someone stole mine. It changed my world as far as sports - basketball, snowboarding, ect. It doesn't skip, and took a beating. I've never wrote a review before, but I feel strong about this product and wonder why apple hasn't hit the sd card/mp3 headphone market yet. The only downside is transferring files using the software- but it's easy if you have half a brain. Wireless is the only way for me for now on, but does anybody know where I can find new ones? Amazon is sold out, and no one is selling them on ebay..."
4,"i'm a man, and i loved this book","she reminds me of bukowski, the simplicity of her language, but there is a lot going on in these poems...she writes about her sexuality, her childhood, her mother's battle with cancer, and she shows the reader the beauty you can mine out of vulgarity..."
1,Way too heavy,"I use spatulas as levers, sometimes to move heavy amounts of dough, etc, and also when I'm doing something that requires fine control. This spatula is the heaviest I've ever used - uncomfortably so. I'm surprised that it receives such high ratings."
4,Spatula,"I like the feel and weight of this item, it is dishwasher safe, and I like the different edges on each side. However, I feel it's a tiny bit stiff and makes cleaning the bowl of batter a bit more challenging."
2,"Started great, now falling apart","I've had this spatula for 3 months, and use it often for both cold and hot foods. I like the shape, weight, and design. However, today when I was mixing flour and water into a sourdough starter, a piece of the tip broke off.I usually hand wash the item, and have not used it at temperatures anywhere near the rated maximum.I thought that since the blade separates easily from the handle, I might get a replacement blade. I went to the Tovolo website, and did not see such an item. Nor can I find one on Google. I also read that Tovolo does not offer direct refunds or replacements. Disappointing."
2,durability is definitely a problem,"I've had this spatula for almost a year. In terms of use, it's great. It's easy on non-stick surfaces as well as enameled cast iron. I use it for baking tasks, too; the edge is nicely tapered. I have really come to appreciate the metal handle (it feels sturdy) and its length. I reach for it often, and after use, it's hand washed.Unfortunately, as others have noted, although it's silicone, it's not durable. I started noticing very small chips to the bottom flat edge within the first few months. And last week, an 1/8th inch size piece fell off into the food as I was cooking - at least it was big enough to notice. Clearly, it's self-destructing, and I'm not sure I'll buy another Tovolo."
2,Not Durable,"As several other reviewers have mentioned, this is not a durable product. I still have it but I don't use it, because large chunks have flaked off the edge. I will try to post a photo before I toss it.I estimate it lasted about 4 months before pieces started coming off.The worst part is, where did those pieces go? I hope they are not lodged in my gut."
1,Silicone breaks off into food.,"Just like everyone else, the silicone tip began to break off into my food. Gross! Also bought it because of Cooks Illustrated's advice. It's a great spatula, until it wasn't."
1,Not holding up well,I have had two of these spatulas for under a year and have been disappointed to see the silicon has developed several large chips along the edges. Not good!Would I buy it again? No!
5,Great information whether you plan to purchase a bandsaw or you already have one,"This is a very well written publication with relevant information and clear illustrations from an experienced woodworker. Helps you determine how to choose the bandsaw for your needs. Also covers multiple other aspects including use, maintenance, blade selection etc. It was definitely worth the money."
3,ISO Settings are not that good,"It's a nice camera but the ISO settings are not that good. If you need to take photos at night you better use a tripod, but if you have to take a lot of night photos I don't recommend it at all. The zoom is great and you have very detailed exposure settings."
1,Panasoic Lumix DMCFZ7K,"LCD screen cover fell off within 30 days and the manufacturer refused to repair it under warranty. They say it is damaged and want to charge me $300 to fix it!The camera is absolutely spotless, no scratches, dents or any other marks and was not dropped.I've ordered a new lcd cover off the web for less than $10 and will glue it on myself.wcn"
2,Panasonic DMC-FZ7 6MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black),I returned the camera. Pictures in daylight are great but night pictures tend to be blurry.
4,not bad atall,"I was about to write a review similar to another post. I initially set it on P, A and other modes only to get horribly shaken pictures (mostly indoors), I wanted to return the camera in disgust. Then i started using the Simple mode and started getting good results.. outddoors in bright light i fnd the A mode very useful. Since I am just a novice when it comes ot camera modes and functioning.. i am slowly learning that this camera can deliver great results as long as u are willing to learn about picture taking. Till then, simple mode shld be the safest bet. The best thing si to experiment with the different modes, as u dont need to wait to develop them.. this is not a serious issue. just dont test drive this one on important occasions.. understand how it functions and then u might get to rely on its performance."
5,Camera lives up to online reviews...,Pluses- Good Build- Great Zoom Lens- Quick poweron and multi shot mode- Wide screen 848 x 480 (16:9) 30fps videoMinus- Icons on buttons wore out after 1 week :-(- Sometimes not able to focus properly in low light/close rangeNo regrets in purchasing this camera.
3,Average Game With Its Ups And Downs,"Really this game isn't all that bad, it infact is a nice game with neat graphics, interesting levels and may i say very interesting cars. The sound to me on this game is great, each level has its own music, the type of music which is perfect for racing to and the controls are easy to learn however, my only complaint is that this game lacks in replay value, like i kept playing this game over and over again until i finally managed to beat this somewhat tough game, but then once i finnished i never even really played this game much, you just get bored of it. I think the game could have featured some special tracks which you could get by completing challenges, and i think this game could have worked more on the fun factor, maybe add more interesting little games for multiplayer. Lowly recomend you buy this, highly recomend you rent this."
4,"Jon Pertwee at His ""Doctor Who"" Best","When UNIT begins its investigation into strange happenings at a secret atomic research center on Wenley Moor in Derbyshire, the Brigadier sends for the Doctor and Liz. With mysterious leakages in the power supplied by the nuclear generator, the stability of the reactor itself is under threat. A major atomic explosion is imminent! The Doctor suspects internal sabotage, until an attack by a prehistoric monster while he is visiting the nearby caves leads him twoards a more sinister conclusion. What is really lurking there in the shadowy depths? Who or what is controlling the monsetr? And to what end?The Doctor must move quickly to arrest a devistating power, active once more after millions of years of hibernation...Another GREAT Jon Pertwee story! If you liked ""The Green Death"", ""Inferno"" and ""The Sea Devils"", you will thoroughly enjoy ""The Silurians"". This is another great Doctor Who classic that can be enjoyed by the whole family!"
5,Finally Here!,"How can you not like Courage the Cowardly Dog? Great first season shows. I was so happy to finally see that it had come out on DVD as they are not showing re-runs on Cartoon Network. Got this DVD for my son, and we have both sat and watched it over and over, laughing each time."
2,un-needed,"Finally a review I can give less than 5 stars!Rct 2 has to be one of the BEST games ever, fixing any minor annoyances of the first.I was pretty excited to see an expansion pack and then disappointed after installing and playing. It just isn't that great. It doesn't add much. The things it does add are 'Meh' at best. Fortunately I got it for about 2 dollars on a certain site so didn't waste too much. By the way, I uninstalled it and continued playing without it. That's how bad it is."
5,rct2 wacky worlds,"RCT2 Wacky Worlds is the best rct game ever if you have Played rct or rct2 but if your new to the games rct2; ww will seam the most difficult pc game ever! if you have the tons of new rides are sweet! and 10% of the old rides have been improved and 70% are re-named the coasters are so exotic picture a neon green pide looping around and in the colosseum or a hot-pink+yellow coaster going over+thru the Grand Canyon! plus sweet, exotic, new, and profitable shops, snacks. All the lims, rides, screams, sounds of trains going 100mph,exotic and wierd colers,and the abilty to build rides around the World is simply to much to put in to words, now i know why it is called wacky worlds I thind it should be rated 1,000,000,000 star!!!"
5,Don't listen to the whiners.,"Be warned that there ARE two different versions of this album, a drone one, and a hardcore punk one. The fact that this wasn't announced is just typical of Boris (they like to f*** with you.) And personally, I like the drone version."
1,warning to all,this camera stopped functioning within one week of purchase. the quality is what you pay for. i'd give it 0 stars if that was an option
3,Ok webcam for the money,"This is my first webcam-- I bought one for me and one for my parents so we could do ""video calls"" using Skype. I was looking for a decent, inexpensive webcam with built-in microphone. Installation and setup was straightforward, as was getting things up and running with Skype. Video quality is ok-- about what I would have expected from an inexpensive webcam. Low light performance is only ok-- there is a low light setting that helps. Things I don't like: the camera is quite light weight and I find it hard to adjust its position (partly, this is because I am using it with a laptop computer). Overall, this is a solid, inexpensive webcam-- easy to setup and use and reasonable video quality."
1,images heavily out of focus despite adjustment - returning,"Just got this camera in the mail as a birthday present. Installing the software was easy, but unfortunately the camera is essentially broken. It is only (somewhat) in-focus for items about 1 inch away. Adjusting the focus ring doesn't help, so this camera's build seems to be defective. My brother bought the same camera and it doesn't seem to have the same problem. Anyway, returning mine."
4,good product,"I am satisfied with the quality and price. It is much better than the product I bought 3-4 yearsa ago (Labtec WebCam, one with lower resolution)"
4,Labtec WebCam Pro,"Both my brother and myself purchased this item and while the picture is a bit dark, probably due to poor lighting in the room, the picture is pretty clear and the video is very good. If you don't want to spend a lot of money for a good product, this is the one to get."
1,Horrible quality...it's worth spending [...] bucks more for a better one,"Only used the camera for one day before I decided to return it. Picture was grainy and does not work well in dim settings. I tried moving my lamp all around my room for better lighting, but the picture was always dark and grainy.For [...] more (including discounts and rebates) I purchased the Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000. SO much better. It has a 1.3 MPixel camera and works better in dimly lit rooms."
1,Tiresome fluff,"I disliked this book for the same reason that I disliked the collection of essays in the ""Mommy Wars,"" edited by Leslie Morgan Steiner. Both books over-represent women who work in the publishing field (journalists, columnists, editors, etc). There is a certain tone that columnists seem to share today and it gets tiresome to me. There were so many cute and sassy anecdotes that had nothing I could truly relate to or learn from. Just lots of fluff strung together by the editor. My recommendation is to find stories about breastfeeding from a wider range of women through bloggs or just talk to the woman around you."
2,Not a must have,"I love Judy, so anything by her is always welcome, but I had greater expectations for this release. Aside from, I Believe in You, and Here's to Us, the remainder of the selections are worthy of one listen and that's it. Even ""I Believe in You"" is annoying to hear when that Louis Nye screams into recording. (Couldn't that have been removed somehow?) I also think it very arrogant when the track listings carry asterisks saying ""Legitimate CD debut."" Most of these songs have indeed been released on other CD's legitimate or bootleg...doesn't really make a difference. Sound quality may be better on some, but what purpose does saying ""legitimate CD debut"" carry? Who cares? I would have preferred a better selection of songs. I have all the DVD's of the television series and as someone else pointed out, these are probably the least memorable moments."
2,Hugely disappointed,"I'm a longtime Judy fan and was looking forward to a new CD, however, with the exception of Here's to Us, there is really nothing worthwhile on this CD. Most of Judy's best moments from her series have been previously released and the Judy Duets album is far better than this. The Peggy Lee duet, the Liza duet, the Merman duet, Streisand duet, Rooney duet among many others were far better selections on the JUDY duets CD. These songs are OK, but I do not think they represent Judy's best ballads or snappy tunes. Not a must have."
3,Could have been better,"Fans of the series should just to buy the DVDs. This compilation is only so-so. The greatness of the series is not captured here. Nice to hear the partial take of SOMETHING COOL and the wonderful HERE'S TO US, though. Looking forward to seeing the release of these two numbers on DVD."
2,awful song choices!!,"I'm giving this 3 stars only because it's Judy...but this really should only get a 1. I have the DVD's (every episode that is available) and these have got to be some of the weakest moments in the entire series! ""Yes, Indeed"" with Dick Shawn?? ""The Boy Next Door"" with Peter Lawford??? And ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" where you can't even hear her sing?? Aside from ""Battle Hymn"" and ""Ol Man River"", this seems like just a random selection done by someone who didn't even watch the show! So much is skipped over...where's Come Rain or Come Shine? Hey Look Me Over? Foggy Day?? I won't even begin to list the great medleys she did with other guests or her amazing concert episode triumphs. This is a MAJOR MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!! BOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,I love Iris Rainer Dart but this did not live up,I have read every Iris Rainer Dart book and this just didn't have the page turner effect for me. I struggled just to even finish the book.
2,True Peter Gabriel Fan,"I thought, after reading other fans' reviews, that this would be a decent cd. Part of the awesomeness of Peter Gabriel is the passion he expresses in his voice. Adding a techno backbeat and wimpy voice singing a masterpiece, doesn't make a great tribute. The only redeeming quality of the disc is that it's still Peter Gabriel's music(kinda)."
2,Not a great game!,"When is the Romulan Academy or Gorn Academy going to come out? This game is not that great, although I can't complain about the graphics. The problem with this game is the fact that when you are fighting Federation starships, the game freezes forever before you collide into another ship. Also, I got up to the part where you're to do a bombardment of the planet Ypres III, and I never can do it. I've spent hours and hours on it, and can't get anywhere. I've even looked at the strategy guide and still can get it. If any reader out there can provide assistance, let me know. Otherwise, for those who are thinking of buying this game, you may want to think twice."
5,Exellent! like a 3d Starfleet Command-but with more ships!,"This game is exellent. Even the demo is jam packed full of features. There are 6 races, and the only flaw that I noticed was the fact that there are no Hydrans. Despite that fact, the game is otherwise amazing!"
5,A Great First Outting,"I bought this CD because I love hearing what the up-and-comers in music are evolving to. This was an excellent first outting for a new artist. The music composition and execution was clean and, unlike most in music today, this artist did not rely on heavy distortion to mask sloppy play. Most of these songs were played clean giving the tracks an intimate feel. It's definitely a CD for musical purists.It's nice to hear how seriously an artist takes their music and songwriting through their work. It shines through here. As is the case with all artists, each new release is an evolution for them. It will be interesting to see where the next CD goes."
1,Tizoc (Amor Indio),"Although this is a great movie,the DVD print is of poor quality. I was greatly disappointed after a three week wait to find such a fine work of art treated in this manner. I had great expectations of seeing this film in its original theatrical widescreen format of the time. (Cinemascope) Instead, it is presented in a pan and scan format which looks like it was burned right off of a cheap video tape. Efforts to contact the distributor were to no avail as their site doesn't exist. That in itself tells it all. Advise, don't waist your time on this item. This kind of quality can be found at your local latino swapmeet."
4,Dewalt down cut blade,"Does a nice job cutting holes for sinks in laminate countertop ,also cuts laminate flooring well .These Dewalt blades are worth buying."
3,Ok for the Money,You get What you Pay for I guess. I mean not the greatest and you have to wear something under because its see through
3,Surprising Talent,"I've never heard about this artist until a few days ago when i got this CD as a present a few days ago.This CD is very exceptional, but it feels a little bit too perfect. Her sound is beautiful, but there's no excitement.Her Meditation sound boring sometimes, but her tone is gorgeous through out the album.Her voice on the last track is pretty amazing for a violinist, and this album is pretty rare and outrageous in good ways."
3,It is better than nothing.,This product did not work on the pet odor I had in the carpet of my car. I would recommend a regular Pet enzyme with bacteria spray that you can get at the pet store or Walmart. This was expensive and didn't work as well as the the Simple Solution I bought at the pet store.
1,Shortest of all of my polo shirts.,"It only reaches about 2 or 3 inches below my waist, keeps pulling out if I tuck it in. I guess I bought the wrong brand."
2,Awkward Lid & Plastic Scratches too Easily,"I have had one of these habitats for over a year. It was given to me with a firebelly toad in it. I have recently upgraded my toad into an all glass aquarium with a deeper water area.The lid has no light and no way to put one in it. It's also a silly and awkward design with no way to feed unless you remove the whole thing.Because of the overall shallow design and the fixed height of the land platform, it will not hold enough water for good water quality.The clear plastic scratches very easily and yellows over time, so you will have to replace it about once per year. You might as well just invest in an all glass aquarium, which will last much longer, and will allow you to customize the land areas."
1,Misleading title,"The title for this item is either outright lying or at best grossly misleading. When it mentions the M4 and M16 models in the title, it won't fit any standard M4 or M16 that I've ever seen. The pellet feeder is on the opposite side from where it is on every other magazine I've seen for the M4/M16, and it won't even lock into place on the gun. If it's for the M83 only, why are M4 and M16 even in the title?Quality-wise, I wasn't very impressed with these either. They come with a giant pink and pastel-starred card that screams ""TOYS"" in childlike letters, and the structural quality is dubious at best. Make no mistake, this is some of the cheapest plastic you'll see. It might serve its purpose; I wouldn't know, since the product isn't as advertised. Instant return."
4,Magazines are o.k.,"I got 3 of these, one broke because I overloaded it. The screws in it are not that good so make sure you tighten them before you load them. Mine weren't tightened and when I accedently overloaded it, BAM exploded. All in all, it's ok, it holds up to 50 or 45 shots."
4,Excellent tea.,"This is a wonderful tea that I originally had at that fancy ""chinese"" style bar with the great food. The tea is well worth it and can easily be made in an iced-tea maker; however, the ambiance is missing in my house. Doesn't taste quite as good as it does when followed with crab-wontons."
4,One single e fatal flaw,"I bought the CoolPix based on reviews from here. It is a fine designed camera, takes perfect pictures and have very flexible lenses. The gadgetry is superb. But:The time delay between the press of your finger and the catch of the scene is so long that is impossible to take snap shots, instant shots. Cartier Bresson will trow away this handsome camera. This time delay is much less in other cameras, like the Olympus D460, which I always have. If you dont need to take that kind of shot, it is a perfect camera for you."
1,programmed to fail,"The Fuji S5000 has a memory chip in it which retains the day/date/time information, but after 12 months to 2 years this chip losses its capacity to hold a charge therefore losing the date/time. Fuji wants $250 to replace the chip! My camera failed a few weeks out of warranty. Each time I change batteries, I have to reset date and time. What a pain in the neck!"
3,"Good, but the plastic snap broke","Not sure how it happened but one side of the ""female"" end of the plastic snap, which is made of relatively thin plastic, broke after a time. This kind of renders the whole pack unwearable."
3,not that easy to use,"it would have been nice if the 2 filers had different grits, but unfortunately they are identical. The grit is too course and makes sliding the tool back and forth a pretty difficult task. Good for taking out the burrs, knicks, and cuts from the edge, but not much of a ""tuner tool"""
3,The ways of danger the story of theseus,"Are you into greek mythology, Do you spend hours wondering what theseus was doing , what you think it was back do you love action? You can find all of that in JUST ONE BOOK!!! The ways of danger is thrilling, informing, and most of all what theseus' life was like and his battles. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!!? People always seem to forget about greek gods, not that im reis but people like catholics seem to forget about other gods not just the lord."
2,"Great idea, but poorly drilled","Got this along with a winch to mount in the receiver on my Ford Expedition. The holes were not drilled properly and the hitch pin didn't fit, so I had to drill out all of the holes in order to mount and install the winch."
3,I wish I had just checked it out...,"instead of buying it! I re-read parts of Book One, The Iron Tree, so I would be ""up to date"" on this sequel. I must admit that I didn't like the main character, Jewel, at all. I don't see why whatshisname (the guy that married her) liked her either. The book began to drag when they started their journeying together, and I must admit I started out skipping pages, then whole chapters, then all the way to the end to at least see how it turned out. I didn't feel any of the fascination that I had with The Iron Tree.Of course with all that skipping I may have missed something vital that could have resulted in a better feeling about the book."
5,My favorite!,The DVD is coming out sometime in the Spring of 2006 - according to the BBC America website. Have seen this movie so many times and I'm still not tired of it. Lost the tapes when I lent them to someone who didn't return them so I am looking forward to the DVD!!!!
4,Well worth a look,"This is one impressive mini series. The costumes, senery and performances by everyone involved is superb. Great for a rainy day, and watch out for James Frain as Julius. This is Edith Wharton's lost tresure, its just a shame she couldn't have detailed the ending for us."
1,Boring!,"From the cover of this book, I thought it would be interesting.However, all of the photos are of the same ""style""--cutouts of men and women. I do not recommend this book."
3,Good cheap phone,For the price you can't find a better phone. Has volume control and that's it. But they work fine for a basic phone.
2,No challenge,"My children, 3 and 5 years old, both thought this game to be boring. We LOVE games in our house and have dozens of them, but there is absolutely no challenge to this game. It is just the luck of the roll. I would say that this game is appropriate for 2 and 3 year olds, perhaps, though a 2 year old may have trouble manipulating the smaller pieces. However, intellectually, I would say this game is much too easy for 4-8 year olds."
2,Peeling Non-stick pans,"I bought these pans a little over a year ago (March, 2011), and the non-stick coating on the smaller of the pans (10"") has come off. The pan has also started to rust. Sunbeam the way to go - or not."
3,Meyer Builds His Body of Work,"As with most Meyer books, this captures South Africa very well and contains a very good mystery at the same time. His writing is sharp and is full of important detail while his characters are real and confronted with amazingly accurate problems. This is a first order thriller."
3,Roses,A pretty basic book on roses. It really doesn't give a person with even a core knowledge much new material. I guess it would be a good beginners book as it has the basic material.
1,"Anyone who declares this mess works,,is employed by the company!",I used this to even out my skin tone my neck is 2 shades darker than my face and chest area.I read the reviews liked what I read and ordered 2 tubes.I applied it according to directions and waited for the (((miracle)))! Well not a damn thing happened!this crap doesn't work either cause it doesn't or the fact that it expired in 2006!gtfoh!!! I'm sure the company knew before they shipped this mess out.btw it smells like furniture wood polish.DONT BUY ! ITS A LIE! UPDATE 03/15/2012: IT DOES WONDERS ON UNTREATED WOOD!
3,Unsure,"I bought it to help with dark marks, as some stated it did for them however it didnt work for that but it is a good moisturizer, however the risk of the ingredients isnt worth it."
3,"I love the product, but my skin hates it","I really love this cream. I surprisingly like the weird smell, I like the texture, I like the way it leave a matte feel/look on my skin, and I love that it contains Turmeric. However, I don't love that it's oil based. Even though it can be used to clear up acne, it actually caused me acne because it clogged my pores :( After a little over a week, I had to stop using this because my pores were noticeably clogged and I had tiny little bumps all over my face. As soon as I stopped using it, the bumps cleared up. I really hate that because this seems so good for the skin! I plan on trying it on other areas like my arms and legs or something."
2,Eh....,"I REALLY wish that this hadn't made me break out. (The fact that I'm basically rubbing oil on my skin though my skin is already oily...) It definitely made a huge improvement to my hyperpigmentation and my pores are much smaller and refined. But the fact that it made me break out definitely outweighs the benefits. If your face does not react well with oil, do not buy this product. Otherwise, this could be an HG."
3,Pack,Works ok. More room than the one I had. Material strong and zipper heavy so will last a while. Still looking for a larger one.
5,Yet another glowing review from a Men's Movement zealot,"The Liberated Man, by the way, sucked in every possible way - almost like a parody of the `80s feminist SNAG.The books since Why Men Are the Way they Are have shown that the author grew up and started to understand and articulate real respect between people, regardless of their sex.Like any other author, Farrell is potentially fallible. People looking for debate fodder in his books should go to primary sources whenever possible. What maybe makes this book in particular is the stuff he includes at the end along those lines.I did a Men's Issues radio show for years, and I agree with what Farrell says about how to talk about such things. I would also recommend people listen to Art Bell - not because his topics are germane, but because he is a good example of a communicator. He doesn't always agree with his callers, to say the least, but he is good at drawing them out and actually listening to them."
4,Almost perfect!,This bag worked very well on our flights from DC to Boston and DC to Honolulu. No damages occured. It's definitely worth the money as others have already mentioned. We have found the only one problem that it does not stand up.
1,Generic problem with amazon's photographic displays,"The views do not show the belt and buckle. I cannot tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side.Why does this matter? For me, it's vital information. When I'm backpacking I carry my glasses/camera/pen/notebook in a fanny pack. Of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle, over the navel. If the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other.A few manufacturers are wise to this conflict. They make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset--between the left hip bone and the navel. The two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other.I won't be considering this product because I cannot discern the photograph."
5,Attention getting and keeping!,"Does anyone know where a copy of this paperback may be found? Doesn't matter how dog-eared, as we would love to read it again and then share with friends whose appetites have been whet. Thanx, shadow 1"
2,Not that great,"I was introduced to this book by someone that said it was great. Being raised Catholic and attending a Catholic grade school in northeast in the late 50's to early 60's there were a few things I could relate to. But overall to be honest I couldn;t wait to finish this book, hoping it would get better.....it didn;t. It is an ok book but not great."
1,Does not work on XP,I have a new computer with Windows XP service pack 2. After repeated install/uninstalls the software still did nothing but lock up my computer. Adobe troubleshooting tips did not help and they did not supply a technical support email address. I returned the software.
5,Memories,Bob Miller has done a wonderful job of putting new life into some of the old standards. Brings back wonderful memories.I enjoyed the arrangments. And musicians are top notch. Thanks Bob
1,This WILL NOT WORK with iPod Photo,"If you have an iPod photo (30 GB or 60 GB), this will not work with your iPod. Do not buy this. It really should be in the description."
5,Fantastic,"Somewhat unbelievable results... pull up any illness + immunocal... over 65,000 clinical studies on this product with some amazing results. Only product of its kind listed in the Physicians Desk Reference and accepted by medicare/medicade. You just will never know unless you try!"
2,"Dated, but still has some worth.","I found the beginning of this book difficult to get through. The ideas didn't seem well thought out at first. The recommendations for research were ancient. Once the author got into the ""meat"" of selling, the book was much better. It has very sound advice for beginning sales reps in regard to customer handling, objection handling, and asking open-ended questions. A seasoned sales rep would find this book a waste of time. A much better read is ""Stop Telling, Start Selling"" by Linda Richardson or the ""Guerrilla Selling"" series by Jay Conrad Levinson."
3,"Loudish, but sissy sounding.","If you are aiming for a throaty throbber of a horn, this is not for you. This horn kit, while loud and distinctive, is extremely sissified. It's a high pitch squeal at best. Watch Cannonball Run, listen to the Lamborghini horn and that's exactly what you will hear after installation. You will need to use the relay. You will also probably need to really think about mounting. The included hose isn't very long. Your options will be very limited to put this under the hood in most modern cars. You'll need some wire, wire clamp connectors, or a solder gun.Installation is a bit more involved than I thought it would be. In the future, I'd probably look for one of the ""all in one"" horn kits instead of the two horns."
1,Want To Pay $31.51 Lb For Loose Tea That's Mediocre At Best? Then Look No Further,"Holy cow, when I placed my order for 24 individual packets I assumed each packet would yield 1 gallon. Wrong. 3 Quarts. Apparently China Mist has taken a different course and screwed the customer out of that extra quart even though all the other brands that offer family size or filter pack tea bags the yield is always 1 gallon.And now for the math...1 box 24 ct China Mist shipped = $35.45. 18 gallon yield = $1.96 per gallon. Price per pound loose tea = $31.51. NEVER AGAIN. First and last purchase I make with China Mist of Arizona. Especially when their product is mediocre at best anyway. Give WALTERS BAY & COMPANY a try people. They make 4 flavors of iced tea and their price which includes shipping and is prime eligible is $30.75 and that buys you 96 1.o oz filter packs...NINETY SIX GALLONS OF TEA.Enough said. China Mist good riddance."
1,Wait for the BBC to restore the audio; 2nd tape has problems,"AWESOME STORY. But due to problems on the source tapes, episodes 6-10 have 'audio dropouts' making the story difficult when not impossible to listen to. This is a shame as it's a great story.Hopefully the BBC can restore the damaged audio track or find someone who had recorded it during the original transmission."
5,The Peak of Canadian Comedy,This show is insanely funny. The characters and storylines are hilarious! A must-see for anyone.
4,The talented Strausses,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching the Strauss brothers and their father through all their interesting ups and downs. They were an unconventional, somewhat dysfunctional family, all very musically talented but all fiercely competitive and jealous of each other. The movie had plenty of colourful, glamorous costumes, dancing and of course beautiful music. I didn't see any problems with the quality of the DVD itself either - it looked pretty good to me."
2,The Strauss Family,A very disappointing production. The scenes at the music halls were amusing - I lost count how many times I saw the same dancers dressed in the SAME clothes. Not something to watch again.
1,DO NOT DO IT !!!,"Wanted to like this product....gift from wifey. I love technology and photos, but the quality of the image on this product is not acceptable. Jaggy edges and too much contrast...not a pleasing result. Tried increasing the resoluton of my photos, cropping photo to the size of the display, but nothing seemed to help. Only paid $60 and it isn't even worth that. Sorry wifey, I am taking it back."
5,Pandigital Review,Was given the Pandigital Photo Frame for Christmas and I love it. I then purchased one several months later to make as a gift but it was not Pandigital and it had to be returned. I have now purchased two of the Pandigital 7 inch frames as gifts and love them. I found that this brand has a control on the remote that allows you to adjust color and contrast which most other frames in the same price range did not have. Thumbs Up!
1,Do Not Buy,"I bought 2 of these and both have the same problem. After running through ~150 photos in the slide show (I loaded ~300 pictures), it gets corrupted and freezes and is distorted. The only way around it is to turn it off and start again. So much for the continuous slide show. It's not the photos as it will get stuck on a differnt photo each time, depending on your settings."
5,"Great, well written, exellent","I loved it. It was well written and extremely real scenerio. It was an exellent book, I would recommend this book to anyone."
5,In awe of this book,"I read this book shortly after its original release, and as with all books, have not read it again. This detracts nothing from the impression I still feel when thinking about this book. An incredibly well written book. Garth is a hero for the ages. The action was quick, hard-packed, & exciting. The descriptions were perfect, never overdone, never vague. The deliberate lack of information from the author lends this story all the more appeal. I know I read this book in two days, sacrificing sleep and probably my homework grades... it was worth it. I recommended this book to my friends once I was finished reading it. They too, loved this book as much as I did. I can not say another book I have read has been pure fun like this one. I'm more of an epic series reader, but as a stand alone story, this is one of my all time favourites."
4,Odd but Good,"This movie sort of has the same feel as Event Horizon. Crazy story and and even crazier ending. If you like horror drama then you'll probably like this. I had to watch this a few times to really get what was going on. Overall I like it and would suggest watching, if your a Dennis Quaid fan."
2,I didn't see that coming... oh wait yes I did,"I gave Dennis Quaid a pass after Cold Creek Manor but he has now lost points in my book for picking stupid movies. I really felt like this movie started out with kind of a cool concept and then just lost it's mind. It had lots of scenes and aspects that were just an absolute waste of time. Examples being all the scenes with the cook character or the sub-plot with Bowers wife. The monsters where not scary in the least and it wasn't hard to figure out their twist. Really it wasn't hard to figure out any of the twists that this movie tries to throw at the audience. Really if you want to watch a good alien movie watch Aliens or even Predator, and if you want a solid space movie watch Moon. All of those are better options."
4,Different,"I wasn't sure what to expect of this movie. Reviews were vague. I tried it because it was cheap. I liked it okay. A buddy of mine who normally doesn't get into sci-fi borrowed it and loved it. So, it isn't your average ""hey-I-like-this-kind-of-movie-so-this-one-must-be-good-too"", but if you want something truly different, give it a chance."
1,Don't waste an hour and a half of your life.,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. You'll spend the entire movie asking what the heck the characters are doing, both because their actions make no sense and also since you will have figured out the plot sequence ages in advance. That extends to the conclusion, as well. Needless and obvious detours are taken in what I guess is an attempt to make this longer than the 30 minutes the story may deserve. The camera bounces from one angle to the next, serving to both confuse and distract from the already sucktacular scenes. Trust me, you'll walk away disgusted in the fact that you can't get the time you spent watching this movie back."
4,Solid Sci Fi,"Much, much better than I'd expected from some reviews I'd read.Yes, it is definitely a variation on the theme of Sci Fi that has come before - lots of Alien / Aliens and others, but the production design is so good and the mutant creatures suitably scary that it all works. For once we get a particularly upbeat ending too.The obligatory giant fan scene is the most cliched scene for me but none of the unoriginal aspects detracted from making this great entertainment.Cast is solid (Cam Gigandet is perhaps the weakest acting but he looks so damn hot who can complain), soundtrack is impressive and blu-ray quality superb.If you love entering dark Blade Runner/ Alien-esque environments in outer space with creepy mutants out to eat you - you'll enjoy a dose of Pandorum. Blu-ray slick has a misprint saying the action takes place 500 miles from Earth...make that 500 million!"
4,Glory Days,"This CD is a small snapshot of the Carter Sisters near then end of their recording days. It is June, Helen, and Anita at their finest and truly reminds the listener of their glory days in the shadow of A.P., Sara, and Maybelle. Early Country Music before it became hats, hair, and popularity. Get this CD. Listen and Respect, Lest we forget!"
5,Excellent Indy,Excellent Indy film. Good plot and story line with some nice surprises and twists along the way.
2,it works but................,"I liked the idea that it has the phone and alarm clock, The bonus is the weather station. The phone works well and the alarm isn't too annoying but the alarm for the humity(on coming rain) will go off in the middle of the night. That is not the best. The other thing is that you can not see the time at night unless you touch the snooze bar."
2,"Might not be worth the ""big savings""","The Oregon Scientific phone works great, once you go to Radio Shack and replace the batteries- the ones that come with the handset don't charge and don't work! So, the phone ended up costing me an extra $15 to make it work. I haven't contacted the manufacturer yet, and I'm sure all they'll offer me is a new battery instead of the $15. Beware."
1,Confusing instruction manual; phone still does not work,"I, unfortunately, purchased this as a gift. It has lead to nothing but headaches. There are two major problems with this product: The manual is horribly written and the phone DOES NOT WORK.The Manual: The manual is so poorly written that it seems like Oregon Scientific intentionally made it as useless as possible. Normally a poorly written manual would be no problem because you could ignore it and figure out how to use the product through trial and error; however, here, this product is not the least bit intuitive. It is apparent that no thought went into the user interface.The Phone: It doesn't work. Period. Despite plugging in the batter and charging the phone the requisite 15 hours, it still doesn't work.Bottom line: Avoid this item at all costs."
3,Good - fast shipment,"Arrived so fast, but each show is very similar in drama/story line, needs little more variety in subject matter"
3,Informative but...,"I still need to sit down and watch it start to finish, since I do appreciate all the knowledge and behind the scenes info on Qigong Healing. However, I am a bit disappointed to find that there is very little standing floor exercise to watch a follow---as if you were in a class following an instructor, doing a several qi exercises and then a routine or two. This is not a video to pop in for your daily routine. This seems more like a solid intro to qigong, which is awesome, but you still will want to buy another DVD for regular practice of any length."
2,telephoto lens and vignetteing,"Quite a bit of very obvious vignetteing around the edges, coming almost 1/3 of the way into the photo at times. Not good for many practical applications."
1,Not a very good book,"This book is full of errors and inconsistancies. Since when are the main people at an Air Force base ARMY personnel? Very hard to follow the story line. It seems the author was in too big of a hurry to write this book. He didn't even bother to prrof read the thing. For me, this book was a complete waste of money, and I won't be buying another one by this author."
2,Sorry not the best book I have read,"Although the description of Madison's life is believable, and I found the cheating of the husband plausible, I found the actions of Zach truly unbelievable in making Madison accept her husband's child with another woman almost from the day of the husband's death. There was no healing allowed, very little grieving allowed, no time to get over the pain of the outside child, just Zach's insistance of shoving the child into Madison's life. Although I understand the child needed a home, and Zach wanted her placed before going to a posibbly uncaring foster home, forcing her on Madison was just a bit much. Maybe Madison would have taken the child in later, after she had time to grieve, but to force her to take the child that quickly just didn't work for me."
4,Predictably nice,I Know Who Holds Tomorrow is a predictable romance novel with a few twists that keep it interesting. I always enjoy Ray' s stories... A nice book to escape from it all and enjoy a little romance.
2,Not New,"I brought this item thinking I was getting a brand new bluetooth. I was wrong. It arrived in a bag and it was used. It has be worn and had scratches all over. When I turned it over it had ""REFURB"" printed on the back. I think the company should have adertised that it was a refurb product and not a new on. I also order the same one in black for my fiance and his was refurbed as well. However, it wasn't scratched up like this pink one. I order this product because I had a new one before and it was a wonderful product and lasted a long time. The only reason why I orderd a new on was because mine was destroyed in the washing machine and dryer. My mistake."
2,Love the color,I love pink so was thrilled when I saw this product. Thats where my happiness ends. The earlpiece does not lay flat against my ear. The person on the other end of the phone gets a lot of static/wind noise etc.I would return it if I could.
2,Would have returned it but was too lazy,"I bought this product after reading good reviews and expected to not have any problems with it. While the product technically functioned, every person I called said that they couldn't hear me. I bought this headset so that I could do work on the computer and talk at the same time, but now I'm back holding the phone to my ear with my shoulder.I use a Nokia 7370 phone, and while the headset is supposed to be for all phones, this may have been the issue.There was a return policy and it's my own fault that I didn't receive a refund, not the company's. Still, I was disappointed that no one could hear me on the phone."
1,Drops connection,"Just got 2 v3c phones + two h500s. Both headsets drop connection randomly. Not sure if the issue is the phones, or the headset, but my older hs820 headset seems to work fine with the razr v3c. Sound quality is poor as well...the headsets will go back to vzw.."
1,Amazon shouldn't be selling this,"I have no idea what they mean by ""Motorola Retail Packaging"", but beware it is not the same as the picture on the website. I received this headset loose in a plastic bag, along with the instructions and the charger. The charger had been ripped out of it's bag and used (the cord had obviously been re-wrapped and secured with a grocery store bag tie).When I complained to Amazon about receiving used merchandise, they immediately sent a replacement via overnight, but the customer service person could have cared a less as to why Amazon is selling used/returned merchandise.I just received the replacement today. While it doesn't look used, it too is just in a plastic baggie - no packaging like the webite shows. I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife (to go with her pink Razr) - I'm sure she is going to be very impressed with the plastic baggie packaging. I sure hope it works better than it looks! Really bad, Amazon, really bad."
3,Love The Color I Picked But.....,"Not to happy with my headset. It came in no time, which was great. I was excited that it came so fast, and when I opened it, It was not in the box as on line. It was a whole different picture and said Universal Bluetooth Headset. Nevertheless I opened it and long and behold it had scratches and chips on it like it fell several times. Did not look new. I paid for a new headset and it looked like a refurbish headset with scratches on it."
4,Item fine - but where's the package?,"When my shipment arrived I was a bit disappointed because I had purchased a new product but it did not come in an original package. I bought this bluetooth for a Christmas gift, so I would have preferred it be in its original packaging (which is why I bought new and not used). However, the ear piece works great, and my wife enjoys it. I also feel better about her driving and talking on her phone!As far as performance goes, there is a bit of an echoing sound on the other end of the line when she is on it. It is not bad at all - you can just tell that she is wearing it. I have been told that no matter which bluetooth you use there is always going to be some sort of feedback, static, or interference. So overall I am happy with my purchase."
3,It's OK,I think this is an OK headset. I don't like how it feels like it is going to fly off my ear. I have had this one for almost 2 years. I don't use it often because sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. At first I really liked it. After awhile not so much. Now I'm on the hunt for a new headset.
3,Just OK..,"Looks really cool, and has something cool colors and all, but overall it was just OK.. It only fits well on some people and not on others.. It feels like its going to come off the ear easy everytime I turn.."
2,Pink Blue Tooth,"The blue tooth came relatively fast, pink is my favorite color. Although it was very cute, it doesnt hold a charge at all. Sometimes people cant even hear me when im using it. I dont even use it at all now, too much of a hassle. It's a good thing that it was only about $20 bucks, I saw it recently at Best Buy for almost $60"
4,Wireless headset,This unit was bought as a gift and my experience is from recipient feedback which has been positive.
1,Re's,Garbage and I was going to send it back but my daughter lost the next week.Waste of money ~ nothing but static!
3,Pink-Bluetooth,My husband gave me it. I like it but I too have too push on it to hear better. It also will call people up if it is in my pocket and not turned off. But it is Pink so you got to love it!
4,Good value for the money,My wife is very pleased with her Motorola H500 headset. The clarity and the durability is much better than a Philips model I purchased a year ago. Battery life is quite good - my wife has to charge her phone maybe 3-5 times before the headset needs recharging.
2,too heavy,This headseat is too heavy & akward on the ear (because of the weight it wiggles...don't even try to bend over with it on). It's hard to tell if the headset is on or off. Would not recommend.
1,Rethink before you buy this product form this seller.,I had this product for only a few months and the ear piece snapped from the head piece rendering it useless. I had barely even used the item and am extremely displeased with the quality and lack of response I got from this seller regarding the broken product. I ended up throwing the item away and eating the money... not too happy at all.
3,works good for the price,easy to figure out it was my 1st one I still use it now and then but doesnt fit to the ear so great so hard to hear sometimes
2,"Sometime it works, sometimes it doesn't","When it works, it works great. Every now and then, it looks like it's paired with my phone, but it's not. I'll dial someone and it's not ringing in the bluetooth, it's ringing in my phone. So...I have to unpair and then re-pair it again. This has happened numerous times. It it currently unpaired with my phone and I am having trouble re-pairing. So, I'm not using it and am looking to buy a different bluetooth. Very frustrating!"
1,Bad battery life,"I bought this as a gift for my wife, but she is having to charge it every two days even if she has not used it."
5,Give This Film A Chance: In your very skin like the books,"Give This Film A Chance, it deserve it! any harry potter documation is worth watching even if it has a reputation as a recycling the best children's book. It is a fantasy for children but any ADULT would love it if one would simply give this book a chance. It took me back to the beauty of being a curious child. There was a great ""cliffhanger"" feeling after each chapter. Favorite Lines: ""...He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign...to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loves us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin..."" like the books I thought that I was too mature to read these books or to see the film. well this film is not for kids but more for older people like me and I am 34."
5,"Very healthful and helpful. Also, very entertaining for all",This book was shown by to us by one of the authors' sister. All of us at work are very eager to obtain a copy. We all feel that this will be very educational for children and fun for the adults to utilize for parties and those who are nutritionally challenged. Keep up the good work!
5,American Insects- A Handbook of the Insects of America North of Mexico,"I use the book on a regular basis. I purchased Arnett's earlier version, too. The earlier version had some information the later version had omitted. Both books were reasonably priced so I purchased both of them."
1,unpleased,The backrest leans back so far that it is not usable. It puts me in my neighbor's behind lap. I will not use it again. And I bought two so that's a considerable amount of money wasted.
1,not for the larger person,I purchased this because of the higher weight rating. The first time I leaned back the hinge bent.
5,Great DVD,"Very informative. Just goes to show that this government, along with most of the tyrannical governments around the world, has no good things planned for the people. We must return to God and rekindle our First Love immediately! I hope Amazon will print this review..."
2,more like eurasian civilizations,"Although concise, Stearns completely ignores the civilizations of the Americas, and has little information on the civilizations of Africa and the pacific islands. Textbooks like this are the reason American students know nothing of native American history. Stearns also is shaky on explaining trade and the connections and influences between civilizations. His visuals and primary sources are few and uninteresting and mislabeled. If this is your class textbook, don't be satisfied! Find other sources to give you a more complete education on world history."
2,Not for you?,This is a good scanner but it is only good for photo projects. Using this scanner for paper is unwise.
3,Review about Eight keys to greatness,"The sending has been more fast than i expect, and the book is in good conditions."
3,"Easy to understand, but simplifies a little too much","I found this book was a really good introduction to the subject - really clearly explained and laid out, unlike some other books I have read, which start of simple and then suddenly leap off into degree-level maths! However, it does tend to simplify a little bit (would have liked a little more information on the types of discrete and continous logistics that can be used).All in all a really good book to buy to keep your feet on the ground when learning"
5,Amazon purchase review,The book I ordered was in perfect condition and I received it very quickly!! I've always had excellent service from Amazon.com!
3,"Muy buenos cuentos, una selección algo limitada","Los cuentos son muy buenos y el libro vale realmente la pena.Lo malo es que son temáticamente muy homogeneos y están todos orientados al realismo de corte periodístico, lo que hace que el supuesto panorama de la cuentística argentina que este libro pretende dar no es tal.Pero fuera de esto, el libro es muy bueno y deberían comprarlo YA."
2,A very incomplete book,"This book is a good INTRODUCTION to visual basic programming. If you have never used VB at all, this is a good book to expose you to what VB has to offer. But once you finish reading it, you will definitely feel the need to buy a REFERENCE book for VB."
3,Borrow this book from the library.,"I started with a fairly good understanding of Excel and some elementary Visual Basic. My goal was to understand how macros work in Excel and I was definitely able to achieve that with this book. The book is set up as a series of lessons that take you ""step by step"" through various projects. The directions are very clear and the screen shots are helpful. In terms of general knowledge gain, I would rate the book highly. However, as a reference manual I was frustrated at my inability to ""relocate"" interesting passages/ideas in the book. Tidbits of information are scattered throughout the lessons and finding something specific again after your initial go-thru can be very difficult. Subsequently, I would recommend borrowing this book from the library or a friend and then buying a proper reference manual afterwards."
1,WORST CAMERA EVER,I bought this camera in July 2005. i just recieved my FOURTH REPLACEMENT on thursday. I have had nothing but problems with this camera. The sound quality on the video sounds like static and is always unclear. It shows constant error meassages when trying to capture photos. I am going to try to see if i can return it and get my money back so that i can buy a better camera.
3,too small,I bought the 9 month size for my 4 month old baby boy. He is 15 pounds now so I thought they would be good for him to grow in to. Wrong! They barely fit him now. They are very cute but buy them BIG.
4,"Nice quality,but run small","I like these onesies,but they run small.I bought 9 month and they almost too small for my 9 month old son,who is in 50 percentale.Consider this fact when buying,other than that it's great product.Great for layering for cold winter month,holds its shape,easy to get on/off."
3,Good for undershirt,"These are ok for an undershirt, but the neck is to low. Seems to be true to size, wouldn't buy again."
2,Not great,"Neck is way too low. I bought these for my son to wear under clothes to keep warm, but because the neck is low, they don't."
4,Nice quality for price,"These are made of a nice quality cotton that is thicker than most onsies. I've just started using them as it is just getting cooler. I have the 3 month size and they are fitting more like most 0-3 sizes, so they may run a little small."
2,it's ok,"item material is good but neck hole is a bit big,would have liked it abit more snug around the neck area"
3,Neck opening way too wide,They are super soft but the neck opening is about three times wider than it needs to be. Yes it's easy to get over baby's head but then ends up looking like a lowcut cowl neck.
4,"Excellent quality fabric, very odd fit.","I love the feel of the Spasilk onesies - they are much thicker and softer than the Gerber ones. However, they are much broader through the shoulder and chest for some reason - even when my daughter is starting to outgrow them lengthwise, they are still wide enough to slip off her shoulders up top! Still, for the fabric quality, I recommend them over any other brands."
3,Very soft but too big in the shoulder area,"The material is very nice and soft. However, the neck is very large, which is nice for dressing, but once on it hangs low leaving my daughter's neck & part of her chest exposed. The rest of the bodysuit fits well"
1,Not 24 month size!,"Received these bodysuits, then returned them. The sleeves are 3/4 length sleeves, not full length. The bodysuit size is small, more like 18 month size. Dont buy, Carter's brand is much better quality!"
2,short sleeve length,Nice material but the sleeves were short in length. The spa silk size 24 months onsies are comparable to carters onsies size 18 months but spa silk onsies had shorter sleeve length (3/4 length) after they were washed and dryed.
2,Not the least bit relaxing - slightly stressful.,"There were two major problems with this tape:1) Excessive speed. She jumps from pose to pose to pose without allowing the student to 'be in the moment' and relax.2) The poses are not always explained in sufficient detail. In a tape geared to beginners, I would expect a quick explanation of what a particular ""named pose"" IS. As a beginner, I did not automatically know some of the simpler poses, such as mountain stance or downward facing dog.Perhaps if the tape moved more slowly, there would be sufficient time to help a new student get correct positioning on a smaller number of poses.All in all, a disappointment. I preferred the Yoga Journal's similar tape, which was slower paced and allowed time to relax both my body and mind."
1,Plastic fabrication,"The ordering, tracking and delivery of product were acceptable.The first pair of shears fell apart before first use.(spring disconnected)The second pair ceased to work on fresh lobster SOFT shell. Shears wouldnot cut through 1 lb. soft shell claws. Do not bother,buy good pair of kitchen (chicken) shears."
1,"BAD DVD COMPANY!!! BAD, BAD, BAD!","The visual and audio transfer on Alpha Video's edition of ""Flash Gordon"" is so poor that I could not understand half of the dialogue. Conversations warble and jitter in and out of silence. The print they used is not from the original serials but from a TV edit from the 1950's - which chops off the original intros, and over one hour of the actual running time. This dvd copy looks bad and sounds awful. Avoid this at all costs. I wasted my money on a product that no one could possibly sit through."
3,Eh!,I appreciate the encouragement for men to step up in regards to being responsible and communicative with their wives. But it the wife really needs to be working on herself as well to be mature and emotionally healthy as she can in Christ.
2,My review,"This phone works fine, however the caller ID does not work. When someone calls the screen simply stays blank. Since this is only the kitchen phone and I only use it to answer the phone right away when Im standing next to it or to make a quick call, I do not consider it a big deal. I can live with that. However, I would not recommend this item. I only bought this phone because I wanted a wall-mount phone for the kitchen and I didn't want to pay very much. I got what I paid for in this instance."
1,Revisionist Dribble,"Alan T. Nolan, an Indiana lawyer, would do better to continue his writing on subjects he is familar...such as the Iron Brigade."
2,"Mediocre remote, poor design","I have this remote as part of my Comcast digital cable package. In my opinion it has way too many buttons. Everyone out there designing a remote should use the TiVo remote as a reference of good design. The Comcast remote has small buttons that are hard to find. There's just too many darn buttons! It's also NOT compatible with certain Samsung LCD TVs, specifically the LNT-4061F."
2,Not Impressed,I used this book in the Las Vegas area in January. It was not very useful. The information given was marginal and years out of date.
3,Good Basic Watch,"Good basic watch. My only criticism is that it is impossibl;e to see in the dark! They applied so little of the substance that is supposed to glow it is barely noticible and there is nothing on or near the numbers.For the price, I expected more."
3,First Wenger watch - Glow dots came loose,"Just received the watch today. The face size is about 43mm with crown. Love the look and everything. The face is not too big or too small. The leather band seems to be made of nice leather. However, the glow in the dark dots at 1,2, and 3 O'Clock came loose out of the box. Three green dots are flying within the dial so I'm returning it."
4,Great but a little outdated,"I got this book after reading Dr. Bock's other book: Healing the New Childhood Epidemics: Autism, ADHD, Asthma and Allergies because my son's major problem is asthma.I really like that this book is more focused towards asthma and gives specific amounts of supplements to give (the other book just gives an approximation.) What I don't like about this book is that it is a bit outdated and is contradictory to the newer book (Particularly the diet topics). Prior to reading this we had already started a gluten free casein free diet (based on the advice from the new book) and noticed dramatic improvements. However the diet section in this book is very different and does not talk much about the benefits of a GF/CF Diet.This book is best used with the newer book but is definitely useful because it goes into more detail about the variety of supplements. If Dr. Bock updated this book, it would be my asthma bible."
4,If you enjoy these episodes....,"...then you should go out of your way to find the novels and short stories of Frank Kane and his detective creation,Time to Prey, Johhny Liddell. I wasn't sure at first, but after seeing Kane's name pop up as writer a number of times while watching the first 15 or so episodes, I realized this was the same Kane responsible for Liddell. In fact, renaming the show Frank Kane's ""Johnny Liddell"", wouldn't be much of a stretch. The action, plots and characterizations of Kane's ""Hammer' episodes are much more in line with his Liddell stories than with Spillane's (with the sole exception of McGavin's smile; Liddell's smile tends to be rueful, or more appreciative than lecherous when appraising the various female forms he comes across). They're worth checking out."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book in hopes of finding many of the toys that I collected when I was a child. Many of the toys I have are from the early 1980's. A cursory glance did not show many toys before 1988. Astrosniks weren't even included, and they were quite popular! I'll be searching for a book that focuses on toys from the 1980's. If you're looking for a book that has toys from the early days, this is not the book for you."
5,Fantastic Frid,"I first came in contact with this set while in college studying woodworking about 6 years ago. While in school I referenced it many times for a complete 'how to' to a 'how do I do that again.' Now, I am still in the woodworking business, and this is a great set of books to have around to consult for what ever reason, thus, I recently got my own. I especially like a chart he has for doing compound angled miters- I must have looked at that a hundred times. Though the pictures are obviously dated, the skills and basics techniques he writes about are timeless, and are a fantastic jumping off point for someone to figure out how to make anything. He teaches you everything you need to know, I highly recommend this set."
5,Sander working again.,I'm glad I could find this part for my old DW420 random orbital sander. The original pad had broken down with age and flung off a chunk (into me at top rpm's.) This new pad fits and runs fine; I've noticed no balance issues.
3,deceptive labeling,"I bought this one in particular because it had no cheap looking labeling, well it does when it shows up. It says ""CHICAGO ELECTRIC"". I could have walked into harbor freight same day and paid $30 less since all these chassis are the same all the way up to shumacher for almost $200. Seems to work ok on the two batteries Ive tested up to 300a.Pete"
1,Blatantly disjointed,"With the sudden death of their father, four siblings return to their hometown from which each fled at various times, for various reasons. The husband of one of the sisters uses his skills as a therapist to talk with each sibling about their lives, past pain, love, and religion in the days before the funeral. The three daughters and the one son each tell the therapist about their relationship with their father, as well as deep secrets that no one else in the family knows (prostitution, drug abuse, incest). The son also admits to his great love affair with another man. With clunky dialogue and stale caricatures, ""Discreetly Dysfunctional"" preaches about how talking about painful episodes relieves one's emotional and spiritual burden. The novel ends in a stereotypical cliché of happily-ever-after for each person, thereby weakening the point of the story with its rose-colored ending."
3,Average,"Father Christmas is an cute, if somewhat light regency about a widow Graceanne with two twin boys who falls for a local nobleman. I enjoyed the beginning, but I began to lose interest after the first half. The story meandered and I just didn't care what happened to Graceanne and the duke. The antics of the twins, Prue, and Leland just didn't captivate me like the editorial review suggested. The romance itself was rather tepid and a lot of time was spent with the twins, the sister and other minor characters. I confess I did not finish and gave up after 3/4 of this."
3,"Old "" Skool"" Kung Fu!!","This flick was produced 1985,,,but the Wu Tang Clan DVD transfer is extremely, unbelievably and remarkably crappy.Elton Chong performed brilliantly in this flick,,however, I'm not sure why they called this ""Shaolin Drunken Monkey"", since there's like no drunken monkey styles in it period. The fight scenes were greatly choreographed. This flick was interesting to watch from start to finished. I would definatly recommend it, but the copy I purchased was my worse experience. Therefore, this flick being a 4 star movie recieved only 3 starsfrom me!!"
5,Best dog reference for new and experienced pet lovers!,"Our new puppy would be joining our family soon, and I needed a few reminders. I had forgotten a few things since our 8-year-old dog was a pup! I was also interested in advice regarding introducing the ""new kid in town"" to our older dog.Although I never cared for the ""For Dummies"" titles of these books, I ignored that and purchased it anyway. I found this book to be a wonderful reference whether this is your first dog or tenth!The text is very clear and straight forward. Great tips and practical information. Abundant topics, answers every question you can imagine.F.Y.I. - We found our puppy at a shelter listed on the [related website]. Check out the dogs in the shelters before going to a breeder. (Please don't even consider a pet shop or puppy mill). This little guy is a wonderful dog and a happy addition to our family!"
4,Good buy,"Good overall buy for the price, took about a hour to install, definetely see a difference in top end power. Combined this intake with a magnaflow cat back exhaust that produced better throttle response throughout the RPM range."
4,Position your business for success with this clear guide,"Alfred A. Marcus's book is so clear and easy to read you may think it's simple to identify and practice his main ideas. That is deceptive. Marcus identifies four qualities that define winning companies and four qualities that define losers. In analyzing why some companies are profitable year after year, the author focuses on nine ""big winners"" and nine ""big losers."" He isolates their characteristics, and uses narratives, numbers and charts to illustrate the winning strategies they use to develop market dominance. He admits that identifying winning qualities in other companies is easier than recognizing them in your own organization. Are you disciplined in maintaining your core vision, or do you tend to be rigid and cling to exhausted strategies? Sometimes, the answers are clear only in retrospect, often when it's too late. Nevertheless, we find that the author's insistence on utilizing core business principles is applicable in any market."
3,"Great Camera, poor audio recording","I just got my camera, put in a tape and as I started filming I imediately noticed that the gears that move the tape are very noisy. I hoped that the microphone wasnt picking up this noise, but when I played back the tape, the noise was very apparent. The microphone is built into the camera and there is no plug to use an external microphone. I am going to get this camera replaced, hoping that the gear noise was an aberation unique to the camera I was sent. It is a good camera otherwise. On the bright side, it is perfect for making silent films."
4,Butoneer Benefits,"I bought a butoneer at Walgreens 10 years ago and it still works. However, I can no longer find the refills or the original item in stores anywhere. It always comes back to the internet. If you can't find it in stores, you can find it on the net. I appreciate the quick turn-a-round of this seller and the condition in which my items arrived. I would do business with them again."
3,"Silly and sex-laden, but Joan Collins is gorgeous","This Italian movie is a good example of the so-called ""peplum"" genre of movies in which tales from ancient history or the Bible were retold with lots of heaving bosoms and flashing swords. As one may gather from the title, the subject of this film is the story of Esther and her romance with King Ahauserus (Xerxes) of Persia, and her battle to save the Jews from massacre at the hands of the evil Haman. For a biblical epic, there's quite a bit of scantily-clad female flesh (especially Rosalba Neri, as Haman's wickedly scheming mistress, in a very suggestive scene), and a lot of military action. Not the most edifying, but the young Joan Collins is stunningly beautiful as Esther, so I'd mark this down as worth watching on an idle afternoon. Just don't expect much insight into the Biblical story or the history of ancient Persia."
2,Disappointed,The production did not follow the Bible as we hoped that it would. This is my opinion of this item.
1,Esther and The King,The quality of the DVD I purchased was so poor that I had to throw the disk away.
5,Fuel Pump,This product works and preforms Well. It has worked flawlessly since it was installed. I have had no problems with it.
2,Weird shape,"I got this for my husband because he loves this style of hat, but when it arrived, we noticed that the seam was in an awkward place which left puckers on both sides of his head when he wore it. So he never wears it. That's what I get for cheeping out."
3,What's the setlist?,"I'd like to buy this, but could someone please tell me the all the songs that are on here. I need a track listing. I wish Amazon would include this on all their DVD concerts."
2,The man of hair that once was but still is if he wants to be,"update 4-20-07, Gary was just on this mornings Live with Regid and Kelly, Trump subed for Regis, and PUSHED this best of DVD as if its cool and he acted all ""I don't go on many shows to sell"" in his usual low key kinda laid backish and koy way. btw, he looks more depressed than ever, and this is beyond an act. Way beyond. Dude needs to get married, come on Gary so you played around to long and now yer outta yer prime, but still. Lower your standards and find a ""simple one"" Gary, oh wait there aint none hahaIts highly likely he is so depressed he does not fully understand that he is, and thus his vibe he is putting off just is not very appealing to the other side. He barely made it through the Regis show, Donald and Kelly were besides themselves. Come on Gary! life is not that bad! We live in AMERICA! Cowboy UP!"
3,"A Good Overview, But Wait for the Entire Series","Worthy of more honors than it received, ""The Larry Sanders Show"" (1992-98) remains a television classic. The ""Not Just the Best"" DVD set includes 23 episodes plus extras ranging from deleted scenes to cast interviews. However, Garry Shandling's selection process may differ from yours. Since the groundbreaking ""narcissitcom"" spanned 89 episodes, this greatest-hits approach will not satisfy everyone. Fan favorites such as ""Arthur After Hours"" (a tour de force from Rip Torn) and ""Off Camera"" (highlighted by the Gene Siskel-John Ritter fight) are nowhere to be found, but a lesser episode like ""Pilots and Pens Lost"" somehow made the cut. As a result, the DVD sampler is recommended primarily for newcomers. Shandling's brilliant talk-show satire deserves to be released in its entirety - with no flipping!"
4,Many Great Episodes: I would Prefer More Shows than the Star Interviews,"I am a relatively new fan of the Lary Sanders' Show and this was my first big introduction, so I found this collection hillarious. I particular found the shows featuring Hank the side kicks lost sex tape and his momentary celebration as a guest host marred by his out of control ego fabulous. However, I would have much preferred a deeper collection and not had the extra space on the DVD filled with so many guest star real life interviews, which frankly I skipped. But virtually all the shows are so original and the interplay between the charcters back stage made this show original, real life, funny entertainment."
3,No way to treat the best TV series ever...,"Looking forward to the special materials.STILL NEED THE RELEASE OF ALL THE EPISODES!This is no way to treat the best TV series ever. Considering all the cr*p that's available on DVD's these days, it's shocking that The Larry Sanders Show in all its glory is not yet available. I understand that they probably won't beat out Seinfeld for sales figures, but it's got to do better than ABC Afterschool Specials, 21 Jump Street, and Murder She Wrote -- to name just a few of the shows available on DVD."
4,Just not the Roast,"I LOVED the Larry Sanders show and was extremely excited to buy the DVD. Over all...it was VERY well done!! MY only reason not to like it...the ONLY reason it didn't get 5 stars was that the DVD did not include the best show they ever aired: ""The Larry Roast"".This was by far the best show...the funniest and best written in my mind yet it was not included. Even though it is not there EVERY Sanders fan should buy this...there are plenty of good laughs. The deleted scenes and the bonus footage was VERY good! A must buy...for any fan."
5,Excellent Choice for Latin Ballads,"Great songs, great voice and great lyrics from this Guatemalan Artist! , Keep on Going! CONGRATULATIONS!"
3,Very typical Niven collection,"Like most of his collections so far (N-Space, etc), this is filled with some short stories, some essays, and excerpts from the novels he's promoting at the time the collection was written. I love the short stories and the essays about writing the novels. Unfortunately, this collection has a lot more of the novel excerpts, and felt more like a ""coming soon from Niven Productions"" than a real addition to my collection of Niven works."
4,A good intro to the Hero's Journey archetype,"It can be a bit too simplistic at times, but this book is a very good introduction to the Hero's Journey. As a matter of fact, I found it more informative than Christoper Vogler's The Writer's Journey. I'm not the greatest admirer of ""how-to"" writing books - I think you either know how to write a story or you don't - but if you want to get a grasp on the basic structure that is used by most commercial novels and movies these days, then this is the book to get."
3,Very different from the first one,"I loved Sonik boom of Love's first CD(A Love Supreme). However with this one, he turns away from the Dance/House style. I was kind of disappointed at first, but when I take it for what it is... It's okay. Nothing special. His first one was very special and one that moved me greatly. This one doesn't get me much at all, but I bet there are some people who would really like it. Just a warning to his 1st CD fans, this one is TOTALLY different. It sounds like a funk/R&B type of thing."
1,Battery will not fully charge,"I bought this battery for our trip to Israel. It would not fully charge. I used it on our 2nd day. I showed 122 min, but stopped working after using it for less than 30 min. I was lucky to have the other battery charged. I could not trust this battery and did not use it for the rest of the trip. I would like a replacement or my money back."
5,Sony FPFH50 Actiforce Battery,I purchase the '50' battery as it is small enough to fit in the camera without breaking the supports. I previously read reviews of the other battery sizes and the reviewers brought this up pretty quickly in their reviews. The FPFH50 are usually found at an inexpensive price and I don't mind have 4-5 of them.
3,Esta Bien,"Esta bien, pero no se porque no parece hecho por Sony el acabado de la bateria es como muy sencillo y las instrucciones de la bateria esta como hecha hace como 10 años, por lo demas todo bien..."
3,"Cute book, nice features, but is very incomplete","I was very excited to find this book because, as an American married to an Indian, I had no idea where to begin in choosing a name for our baby. It is nicely laid out, enjoyable to read, and has helpful features such as recommended names and names to avoid in the U.S. However, even I was starting to find that many common names of Indians I knew were not in this book! That's when I started to do Internet searches, and found a number of websites that were much more complete. I highly recommend that the authors publish a new expanded edition, given that this one was published 13 years ago and is sorely in need of an update."
5,We need more Todd Parrs in the world,"All of Todd Parr's books have positive, important messages for children, and they are nicely offset by the kooky, cheery drawings. This one shows a wide range of mommy behavior as normal (""Some mommies work at home, some mommies work in big buildings."") I love reading this to my 2.5 y.o and the daddy book is great as well."
4,Brilliant colors!,"My daughter is 18 mos and LOVES the colors and simplicity of this book.I enjoy the colors too. Really bright, brilliant colors. We enjoy reading this book."
2,Not fun at all,I just bought this game at Gamestop 'cause it was much cheaper than online. I got playing it right away. It was not fun at all. You go through coins super fast because everything costs so much. Your cat keeps going to the bathroom on the floor which means you have to clean it up. Your cat doesn't do anything. A cat in real life is much better. Trust me I'm ten and I all my life I've had a cat. I've never been without one.
1,Tedious,Very slow and not interesting. Lost interest after the first several chapters after nothing new was happening.
4,Good workout,I enjoy it. Just starting to workout again so this is a good starting point. But I know after a while it will still be a good workout.
4,good!,"At first I thought this video was ""just ok"" because I didn't like how it went from high-low-high-low intensity. For me, I'd rather have a consistent ""high intensity"". However, after a week I learned to like it. Chalene is energetic as usual and it keeps you going! Love Turbo Jam and I've been shedding ""those last 10 pounds""!"
3,A primarily psychoanalytic and somewhat disappointing book,"Although it covers a broad spectrum of experience (if from a somewhat limited viewpoint) I expected a lot more from a book that has Stephen Whittleand Janice Raymond contributing adjacent chapters. Thecore of the book is a debate about the historical construct- ion of ""transgender"" and its legitimacy in modern culture. The arguments against, with the exception of Raymond's revised introduction to the Transsexual Empire (1994), seem to predate the emergence of ""transgender"" as a term, and thus don't address any of the cultural developments that have sprung up around it. Furthermore, as psychoanalysts predominate, there is an annoying tendency for essays to treat transgendered subjectivity as a source only for raw data, and not a legitimate independent critical voice."
1,"Not as advertised, stay clear...","Dewalt maks very good equipment and these are good, but stay clear of the advertised product as I only received one and not 25 as noted. I can purchase these locally for as little as $2.50 each and if I traveled to get to lowes, only $1.50 each. Also, these are refurbished wheels and poor packaging through third-party, unknown seller. Don't get burned like I am."
3,"great concept, needs improving","we love the idea of this. teaches patterns and sequences, colors, counting. however, the beads themselves are lacking. the blue and purple beads are hard to tell apart. The colors on the sequence plates are also off. also the shape of the beads are very subtle."
2,Mediocre Medical Mystery,"Vicky Lucci is the risk manager at Montmorency hospital in Denver Colorado. One day, Jena McClaren shows up in her office with a problem. The hospital has declared Miss McClaren to be dead. Vicky must sort out this problem and finds this mix up is just the tip of the iceberg. What follows are mysteries and intrigue involving drug experiments and murder. The pace of this story drags quite a bit in places. A little more action and less of Vicky Lucci's thought processes would have been nice. The characters were interesting and the dialog was good, but the story itself was just mediocre."
4,Flange and Nut,"Make sure that when you order the grinder and its guard, that you order the flange and nut (sold in the guard kit). I've been told by telephone sales that they are not included."
2,VERY Boring,Seriously bad audio-visual and did not keep me or baby engaged at all. We quit after 5 minutes. I was very disappointed.
2,Waterproof? Up to a point.,"The international standards of what is 'Waterproof' are a bit loose I think. This is actually OK if you immerse it up to about 1m deep for less than 30 seconds at a time. More water than than, and the so called waterproofing, is not so much.So, when you flip the catamaran several times in an afternoon, and take up to 15 mins to pull it upright again each time. this unit will not survive. You have been warned.However, if you are not planning to get it more than splashed with a few waves over it, or a bit of rain, or the odd straight turnover in a kayak, it should be fine.Until it got wet, it worked great and they found lots of fish with it."
4,WHAT PRODUCT ARE U ALL REVIEWING???!!!,"The sounder/fish finder I purchased ( 190C ) had no SUCTION CUP...??? It is a simple, SINGLE, beam transducer, color sounder. It is an easy install and the sounder works great. I highly recommend that you buy the in hull transducer mounting kit if you are installing this in a kayak. Be sure to follow the installation instructions explicitly!!"
1,do not buy this fishfinder,"i bought this fish finder 2 week ago. after i opened then realized item has been used before, and also it doesn't work correctly. i saw the screws of fish finder has opened before , because the screws were damaged.ATT Amazon doesn't accept any electronic items if you opened Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo how can i know the item working or it doesn't ??????????????????????????????? This is stupid return policy."
5,Beautiful Puzzle,My child is 4 and she really likes to make this puzzle and the image on it. She finds it challenging but not daunting. The quality and durability of the pieces seem adequate but not extraordinary.
3,"Lack of ""play all"" feature cripples this DVD","Enjoyable shorts, but I can't set it up for my kids to watch. This one feature would have made this one of our family's favorite DVDs. Without it, this will be seldom seen and will probably end up in the back of the closet somewhere. Disney flunked with this one and I wont buy DVDs without this feature again."
1,"The Menu crippled, no ""play all"" is anoying","Great toon's but you have to play them one by one, it's anoying"
2,like for dummies,"Similar in depth to a ""for dummies"" book; oriented to building data entry screens; says what to do but not why. (Perhaps tr from Texas is much smarter than I, or read a different book.)"
3,Good examples but not the whole story.,"I learned more about Access97 than Access97 Visual Basic with this book. The author concentrates on how to apply VBA to specific senarios. If your needs match one or more of the senarios, your in luck. Its definitely not a comprehensive tutorial of VBA and certainly no reference guide as mentioned in previous reviews. I suppose you have to be already fairly familiar with Visual Basic (which I'm not) to appreciate it."
1,Not Happy At All,"I bought the CD for $30.00 paid the shipping and waited for it to be delivered. The day it was supposed to be delivered I got an email that they refunded my money because it wasn't sent on time. I wanted this CD still, but when I looked up at this account again they marked it up to $90.00. I think that is very dishonest and unfair since I did pay for the CD and they seller held out to make more money. Not impressed."
5,Historical perspective.,"An excellent historical perspective of the scriptures.Anyone who knows anything about the Bible knows the pitfalls of literal interpretation.This was taught to me by Christian Brothers when I was in college.Pellegrino is a multi-disciplined scientist and a very readable writer.He insults nobody, but the ignorant.Five Stars!"
3,Worth A Listen at the Right Price,"This nearly 20 year old tape set has the typical motivation and techniques you would come to expect from a tape set focused on MLM and MLM sponsorship development. The material is getting dated, so are the techniques - and some, like the internet, aren't even touched on. However, MLM, like any other sales process, is predominantly a people and a psychology, and Tom Schreiter has those elements well covered. If you can pick up the set for a few bucks, it's worth a listen."
1,UNRESTORED Cartoons with Faked Title Cards,This is a terrible DVD - ALL the original title cards have been removed and replaced with new versions with all references to Columbia Pictures and United Artists being removed!! You can hear the original sound to the Columbia Pictures logo intro but instead you see a reanimated sequence - the same goes for the United Artist Mickey Mouse cartoons - THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS PART is that all the opening and ending sequences have been reanimated and changed to LOOK LIKE the original openings to people who don't realize that they are BRAND NEW ANIMATED sequences - but they are obiviously FAKE when you compare them to original film prints!
4,2 albums in 1,"Not sure what the second album with the 'Orchestra' is but the first half with the 'Quintet' was also released as 'Cal Tjader Plugs In', from a live show at the Lighthouse, February 1969."
2,"masterpiece, but.....","If you want to buy the right master, the japonese édition is the good one: this CD has the good master tapes. I bought the too version, the american is a disaster, this FM sound with a kind of reverb..., but the japonise import is the good one, like the vinyl quality.So listen to the best solo album from Jon Anderson,this is a truely masterpiece.Excuse-me for the mistakes of langage, I am french!!!Hope this will help you for the choice!"
5,this is so bad it is histerical,"I own this film on vhs and have enjoyed it over the years. This is truly a bad movie, but it is so bad it is campy. On that level, this is truly a gem. The acting is terrible as well as the film work itself, but the script is wonderfull and this is why the film actually works. It is well written and if it had a real budget, it could have been actually very good.The concpet of the film is the hero goes out on a ""date"" and is bitten by what he thinks is a woman. When the moon comes out, Larry changes into a transvestite. Now add all of the cliches from hollywood about transvestites and horror films and you get the idea. It really does work on its own level.If you want to spend time laughing, you have to buy this film. Just remember, it is terrible. It is terrible on the level of ""bubba ho-tep"", but with a much worse budget. Highly recommended."
5,"Excellent Book, Fast Shipping",I couldn't put this book down. If you are in the military and have been to Afghanistan this is a must read. When you read this book you will feel as if you were there. It took around 3 days (standard shipping) to receive this book and about 3 days to read it. Enjoy...
4,Terrifying metaphor,"Metamorphosis was my first introduction to Kafka and I found his dark humour unsettling yet addictive. Samsa plagued and burdened with poverty and family responsibility, is in the end betrayed by himself and his loved ones in a dramatic turn of events. As a ""useful"" and able man, he was respected and cared for by his parents and loved by his sister. But after the metamorphosis, his family at first tolerated him, his sister perhaps pitied him, but towards the end, it turned to hate and disgust. They realised Samsa had become a burden and embarassment to the family. A useless vermin stuck to the family walls. Metaphor taken to great heights. Physically and intellectually an insect, but emotionally and spiritually still a man."
4,Xbox system link cable,The grandsons say that they use it all the time. They hooked it up so I don't know the specifics but they really like it.
4,A brilliant read...even if it doesn't go anywhere.,"Sure it has themes of incest-- and page after page of graphic depraved behavior...but Amis writes with such a witty prose, that it's a pleasure to read. It's a quick read too. And a damn funny one. It just lacks any sort of trajectory."
4,Good supplement,"You cannot learn everything in the few months/weeks leading up to boards. I think this book was helpful to me because it had good memory tricks...and I can remember something better if it makes me laugh. I read it 3 times in the coffee shop over the 10 months leading up to boards, but my primary text was Zitelli. I passed even though I was doing a fellowship in neonatlogy at the time. I passed."
1,Thankful a Friend Gave It To Me...,"...because it didn't help me at all. First, there is just too much to memorize. I have to know ""why"" and be able to explain things fully in order for them to stick; rote memorization just doesn't work for me, but I thought I'd try since EVERYONE sings its praises. There are endless pneumonics that require one to memorize first what they stand for and then what they are related to...and they're not funny. The side notes on question traps were helpful until I started to find lots of errors in the text. I was then too paranoid to believe anything I was reading and gave up. I'd heard rave reviews about this book and how people have used only this to study. I think they either mastered the information beforehand or are test-taking whizzes and just needed a quick review, pearls, and tips.I found MedStudy very helpful for my learning style and it seems to be the Cliffs Notes version of Rudolph's Pediatrics, my favorite comprehensive pediatrics text."
5,Great movie!,"A great DVD for Disney fans to know how the Disney studios looks like, how the Disney cartoons are made and a part of the Walt Disney Co. history in a very entertaining way."
3,A guided tour prearranged,"Although I bought this DVD for the main feature, The Reluctant Dragon, it contains more infomercials on the working of the Disney studios.Even though the insights of the studio are prearranged, you see only what you are allowed to see, it gives you a general idea of the production process for an animation, whether a short or a full feature. But remember, not many studios give you this kind of insight.The humor is lame and is similar to the humor you find in the Disney shorts with Mickey Mouse, Pluto or Goofy.Having seen some of those infomercials you get the picture.The Reluctant Dragon has two scenes to watch: the story board showing of ""Baby Weems"" (which shows it may be a good short), and the featurette ""The Reluctant Dragon"". The live action should be taken for granted and may raise a smile."
2,singing babies,"I don't know what I thought this video would be, but it's pretty cheesy. The babies move very little except for the superimposed lips on their faces. Even though the songs and costumes change, the video became boring very quickly for my two year old granddaughter, and she left the room."
5,Love Nicholas Sparks,Easy read but so suspenseful. Amost read it in one reading. Wish there was a sequel. On to another Nicholas Sparks book.
2,The Guardian - Predictable and Disappointing,"I am an avid Nicholas Sparks reader, so I was overjoyed when his latest book the Guardian was released. I ordered it through Amazon and could hardly wait for it to arrive. Then I read the book. Normally I am unable to put one of his books down, but this one was easy to part with. The story was predictable, the end was disappointing and the characters were very simple. While I enjoyed the love story element between the main characters, and I LOVED the dog, it was really difficult to get into overall. It was okay, but it didn't meet my expectations for a Sparks novel. It seemed more like a script for a movie then anything else. I am looking forwad to his next book, hopefully he'll shy away from the thriller elements and stick to what he does best."
3,Not as good as his others,"I am a big Nicholas Sparks fan and have read all his books and loved them all, except this one. I hate to say it, but it was very predictable, from the very beginning of the book. I didn't have any trouble getting through it, it wasn't boring, but I had it all figured out in the first few chapters. I was also very disappointed in the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but I think it could have been done another way. I think Mr. Sparks should stick to his normal style of writing."
4,"Tiffany ""The Guardian""",Well I like the book very much because if you read it you will get caught up in it and you will actually fell like your in the book. I think it will reflict on youlife very much. Like if you was married and your husband died and lefted you a puppy and said he will always watch over you he will be your guardian angel.Like couple years later you start felling lonely and your tired of staying in with a dog so you got a on a couple dates and you find two good guys but u cant decide who u like the must one the man will be your future man who will she choose? do you know?
2,Juvenile Fluff,"Sappy love story; I could tell instantly from the start what was going to happen and who The Guardian would be. Very ""formula"". I read the whole thing because that's what I do, but decided the friend who recommended it was totally into ""beach reads"" at the time and must not have had anything better to do. I can't do anything but scoff about this book."
3,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of Nicholas Sparks, so I'm sad to say that I'm disappointed by his latest foray into the suspense genre. Sparks has the ability to create authentic and appealing characters caught up in life altering situations that are heartwrenching and compelling. In this work we have cardboard characters whose appeal to eachother is the only mystery to me. There is no suspense and the story rather than being emotional seems a parody of the romantic suspense genre with each character doing and behaving according to an established formula.The history of each character is described in so dull a fashion that it is like reading a history text. The reader never feels the 'Sparks' that makes his previous novels so compelling. Read or reread one of Sparks previous books and wait for this one to come out in paperback."
5,Her true guardian,"This is one of my favorite Sparks books. This is the TRUE SPARKS THAT EVERYONE LOVES! THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ! The book starts off after Julie's husband dies, and on Christmas, she recieves a gift that from him. It was a great dane, and she named him Singer. Her husband wanted to make sure that Julie was always taken care of. Four years had past, when Julie started to date again. A lot of her dates had been just regects or no-thanks kind of guys. Until she meets a nice, handsome, dreamy guy named Richard. But then their is also Mike her late husband best friend. He had been in love with her for problably years. She dates Richard for a couple of weeks, decides that he is not the one, then decides to go out with Mike. Then Richard changes.This is a tottally different kind of Sparks book. It has romance,sadness,mystery and not to mention suspense.Read this book to find out who her real guardian is!"
5,WOW!,"I cried while reading the Prologue, I cried at the end.... and I couldn't put it down throughout the rest of it! What a great book. A love story AND a thriller. My hat's off to Nicholas Sparks.... I think I found my new favorite author. I recommend this book without hesitation!"
5,A non-stop page turner,"Hi my my name is Rachel MacGowan, and I'm a senior in high school. I have always loved Nicholas Sparks since about my freshman year. I love the way he writes, and I like to read romance books, but not too romantic* :) This book was really good, I suggest that anyone who has not read The Guardian, should read it. I could not stop reading it, I kept wanting to know what was going to happen next... I definitely reccommend this book for others to read. I loved it! I'm letting my best friend read it. Thanks!Rachel*"
4,good read....,"This is def. something you wouldn't expect from Nicholas Sparks, but ultimately it's a good read, I couldn't put it down!"
3,Meh...could have been better,"I read The Notebook and loved it so I had high expectations for The Guardian. The book was ok, but it was too much like a late-night Lifetime movie for me. I suppose I don't regret reading it, but I wouldn't read it again, or recommend it to any of my friends. If you like trite romantic fiction-I guess this book is for you-even if it's not for me."
4,"A Taste of Romance, Suspense & Thriller","I absolutely love Nicholas Sparks. I am used to his highly romantic, tear-jerking stories that I can read from start to finish without taking a break. When I finish one of his books, I usually just sit back and think, ""Wow..."" I guess I expected the same sappy romance out of ""The Guardian"", but was surprised when it turned out to be more thriller that romance. Don't get me wrong, it is still a great book. I could read it all over again and enjoy it just as much, but I just wanted the review readers to know that it is not ALL romance. If you are used to romance novels, but you want to get your foot in the door on thriller and suspense, this book gives you a taste of both worlds without having to sacrifice one or the other. Overall, this is a great book."
3,nothing surprising,"I finished ""The Guardian"" just today, and this is my review: The first half is long, for you expect what't to happen. I haven't read another book from Sparks, but to me it seems like it's been written by a woman for the way he expresses the characters' feelings and how he tries to unfold every day-to-day thing. It feels like he tries to make a big deal out of what we would consider a casual thought, it kind of gets a little boring at the beginning, but I have to admit that almost at the end it quite got my attention - just when the action takes place.However it striked me as one of those books where it really happens what you expect to happen, all the time. I think it's an o.k. book but I wouldn't read it again. Just an entertaining book."
4,Kept me going!,I was able to jump right into this book!I originally bought it just for a school assignment but I really enjoyed it had a couple long nights with it as well!
2,Not Great,The first part of the book was slow and so predictable. The book picked up a bit in the middle thanks to a sharp-thinking policewoman. The ending wasn't enjoyable at all.
2,Predictable and disappointing,"I am an avid Nicholas Sparks fan so I was so excited when this book came out. I could hardly wait to get my hands on it. Then I read it. It really was a disappointment. Certain elements of the book were great, the character development and the love story portion of the novel. I loved the dog! But the thriller element of the story was highly predictable and ultimately the conclusion was extremely disappointing. Normally I can't put down one of his books, but this one was easier to part with. Okay overall, but I realy feel he could have done better."
2,"Clunky writing, uninteresting characters","I read the first couple of chapters, found myself bored, and skimmed through half of the rest of it. It's just not worth reading.If you strip off the sinister plot twist (which I won't spoil here, and which I found creepy and distasteful), then what you're left with is a really badly-written Harlequin romance with average small-town protagonists who aren't very interesting!As a romance, this is a real clunker, with mundane dialogue, and even worse writing when it comes to what the lovers are thinking about each other. The faucet springs a leak and Julie gets soaked, and he has to tell himself not to look at her breasts, which would be the thrill of some spring break wet t-shirt contest? She thinks his butt looks good in jeans? Oh My God. It's just so banal and juvenile. I can't believe this guy is a ""#1 New York Times Best Selling Author!"""
5,The Guardian,It's a sweet love story with a suspense/thriller on the side that gives an exciting edge to the story and makes the reader want to know more. I am a sap for love and stories that make me cry and I did when the dog dies at the end because the dog is such a part of Julie it's sad to see him go and I cried. I think people should definitely read this book. If you're into thriller read it and if you're in it for love read it for the happy ending.
2,Poor work,"This book is very predictable and boring. I've never read a book that is so wordy. Instead of igniting imigination and provoking thought, the author drudges through mundane, descript dialogue.Waste of reading time."
4,Recieved,"I finally received this order. It was over two weeks late, but it did arrive. The package was damaged but the order was complete."
5,"no hdtv yet,but i have digital dolby receiver","im thinking about buying the high dfinition pack for the xbox.i dont have a hdtv yet,but i have a digitaldolby hometheater system.can i still hook this up to my system to get the dolby digital sound?yes i know i have to buy a separate optic cable.if someone can help,let me know.thanks"
2,Cheap Cables -> Glitchy Video,"This product worked fine for the first month, but then I started getting periodic video glitches, usually in the form of a ""streak"" or smear running from high-contrast objects (like football players) all the way to the right edge of the screen. Soon after that, the video started going black-and-white and even sometimes would black out completely for a couple seconds at a time. This happened during 3 different games. It turned out to be the cheap cables Microsoft ships with this. Wiggling and repositioning them helped, but you'll want to replace them with higher quality cables at the first sign of trouble."
1,Wrong Product Delivered Twice,"This poster was advertised in English, but came in Brazilian. Amazon was notified to exchange and it came a second time in Brazilian. I want a refund. WARNING!! DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT IT IN BRAZILIAN."
1,Not worth it.,I bought this and was dissapointed.It was not good at turning at all eventually I got angry and threw it straight up and watched it fall and crash into nothing.That was the most fun I've had with that plane.If you're looking for an easy plane to fly buy the Tyco RC sky scorcher it is way better.
3,Not their best flyer.,This plane is very difficult to fly and is underpowered. It is not nearly as fun as the aero ace biplane and jet which are more controllable and have superior battery life. I would not recommend this plane to anyone whos trying an air hogs product for the first time. This jet is simply too difficult to fly for any first time users and the controls are not as intuitive as they appear to be.
4,NASB Minister's BIble,"I think I'm going to love this Bible. The shipping was unusually slow and the advertisement said that the Bible came with two ribbons. In reality there was only one. It would be helpful if the seller would point out, prior to purchase, how slow book or library rated material travels. I can live with one less ribbon. Other than these two minor irritations, the Bible seems to be in excellent condition. pj"
2,kodak easy share,I don't know yet if the printer is any good. Was not told the printer needed a new cartridge and am having a difficult time finding a cartridge for it so have not been able to print any pics
4,Kodak C310 vs Kodak C300,"The Kodak C310 is a very good camera, but seems a less sturdy when compared to the C300, which my wife bought, and which we had been sharing until I bought the C310. Also, with this particular camera, we noticed a small spot on the inside of the lens, which shows up on metal items. Other than that, I like the camera."
5,Easy to use and great picture quality,The software was very easy to install and learning to use the camera was a breeze. The picture quality is great and they print fast with the dock. The ink did run out quickly...The editing software is easy to use on both ends...editing the pictures and opening them when sent via email.
3,Kodak C 310,I was disappointed with the product because I thought it had a zoom feature for taking pictures at a distance. It does not. This camera should only be used for close up pictures.
2,For older X-Box models only,"The item arrived in the mail quickly and was exactly as advertised. Unfortunately, it doesn't work on the new X-Box models."
4,better version,"i really enjoyed the process in which the main characters learned more kung fu to add to there arsenal.I also was happy to see one of my most favorite actors in this movie which is ""LEUNG KAR YAN"", a very exceptional actor. It was just a more adequate version then the other one i have. It's also nice to see two different sides to one thought. I have both versions and this one is by far the best.(TWO THUMBS UP)"
4,This is a great game,"Any owner of a Nintendo DS should own this game. It's very fun, it's a lot like the pokemon games but it's also different. It's fun, get it."
5,"If you surf, don't even stop to think about it...just buy it","It's nearly impossible to put a price on the value of the information in this book if you surf. So at $21, it's an absolute steal.The book is simply crammed with detailed, up to date information on where to surf, stay and eat in Costa Rica. And in a country that's tough to get around, Parise's information can save you tons of wasted travel time.I can't recommend this book enough if you're planning a trip to Costa Rica to surf. Trust me...you'll be thankful to have this incredibly informational resource in your possession."
5,Awesome book a must for costa rica,"My hat goes off for Mike Parise, job well done. A super book for anyone wanting to ride waves. a lot of other great information as well about being able to survive in a different culture. Made my trip much more enjoyable and was a book that I picked up the first day in Costa Rica at a surf shop. Great work period."
2,something lost in the translation,"I was greatly disappointed by the usually fabulous Cubanismo. I was hoping the fusion of Cuban music with New Orleans jazz would be awesome. Regrettably, I found the entire CD to be uninspired (except for the one great song on the CD - ""Paso en Tampa"").I own two of Cubanismo's other CD's (Cubanismo and Reencarnacion) and these CD's get a lot of play on my stereo. I would strongly recommend these five star albums to Cuban music lovers."
5,TRUE CRIOLLA,This CD was like eating really good criolla food. The perfect blend of spices and rhythms gives this Cubanismo CD all the right stuff. We loved every song on this CD. The tunes are memorable and I find myself humming them throughout the day. We dance to them and truly immerse ourselves in the feeling of being in Havanna at one moment and New Orleans the next. This is truly a recommend to anyone who likes Cuban and/or Cajun music.
2,Badly Remastered,"I was really excited about this reissue, especially after reading the other reviews. As soon as I put on headphones and listened, my heart sank. Much of the album is absolutley smothered in noise reduction. The quiet parts of the album are dead and glassy and there is not a trace of hiss. They spiked the treble in an attempt to retain some of the high end that they stripped away. It sounds really bad. I have seen this remaster descibed as ""clearer"" and ""crisper"". It's a farce. They heavily processed the tapes to make them seem cleaner than they really are, and in the process damaged the sound. If not for the remixed bonus tracks, which are a marvel to hear, this reissue would be totally worthless. Also, the alternate mixes of ""Curly"" and ""Blackberry Way"" are tacky re-processed stereo and not genuine alternate mixes. Very poor work on the part of Salvo and their hack remastering team."
4,Shazam by The Move,"I bought this on LP way back in the 70s and it has long been a favorite of mine. I especially enjoy ""The Last Thing On MY Mind"" the wonderful of the Tom Paxton folk tune. The steady, but creative bass lines on this cut are some of the best ever recorded. It is worth the price for this song alone."
5,a great effort,"I have been fortunate to hear the Beaux Arts Trio perform this music live as well as own this recording. Among chamber music ensembles, they have few peers and no superiors. These performances are a complete success individually and collectively. The violinist Daniel Hope rose beautifully to the challenge in these works, among the most taxing ever written in the Trio literature. His colleagues are brilliant too. The sound, documentation, and vocal contribution are excellent too. A wonderful CD."
5,"An Oldie, but a Goodie","I had this on 8-track and was not able to listen to it for 30 years. I recently saw Steppenwolf live in concert, so I tried to find this on CD. I am not disappointed. My friends and I would sing Smokey Factory Blues on our way to working at the steel mills. This CD has a lot of great Steppenwolf music you don't get on their classic Gold greatest hits CD's. It is worth a listen."
4,Hot Air Balloon Hummingbird feeder,"Nice product at a great price, attracted hummingbirds right away and looks good in front of our picture window.Good delivery service."
3,Good Debut Album!,"Me personally, I have fell in love with that dang song ""Why Don't We Fall In Love""! So I had to cop this cd and see if there was any good songs just like that one. Well that is one of the problems.....almost 2/4th of the cd has the same sound.But it is fine because it's only a debut and her producer needs to be fired....well maybe he could do one song on her next LP. Anywho, I really liked most of the songs even if they did have kinda the same sound. It's a good R&B/HipHop cd.The really major problem with this cd is that it's short and the ""Why Don't We Fall In Love(remix)"" isn't on this cd. If you buy this cd...well that is coo! It's overall a good debut cd and I am waitin' for the next LP from this fine Black/Asian gurl.Peace!"
2,It has to grow on me...,"I was expecting this whole album to be like the first single 'Why Don't We Fall In Love?' but I was sadly dissapointed. It's not a horrible album, but it's certainly not the best. Amerie is a beautiful, gifted singer, but this album just doesn't seem to shine. A good debut album I would advise people to buy is Toya's (singer of 'I Do!!) debut album... It is solid and enjoyable! I still support Amerie, she has great potential."
5,Bright debut,"A more impressive debut effort than Ashanti. Kudos to Rich Harrison for his production, composition, and instrumentation. Amerie's glossy and soulful vocals are a breath of fresh air. Hopefully Sony/Columbia will give this album its promotional due - assuming they have any money left after blowing their promo budget on that no talent Alicia Keys."
4,Mellow CD,"This is a good cd for Amerie's first. I have heard people say that all of her songs sound the same. I feel it is all in the way you look at it. Her first sone got on my nerves becasue the radio stations played it so much, but I got her cd any. I really liked it. She has some nice words in her song. She has a soft mellow tone on her cd. I would recommend this to anyone who is just looking for a smooth groving cd."
4,Awesome debut!,"When Amerie was introduced to radio and T.V. with her first single, ""Why Don't We Fall In Love"", I had to see what the fuss was about. After I taken a look, I found out why. This woman has great looks and a great voice. Her debut album, ""All I Have"", has many great songs. Some of my faves include, ""Why Don't We Fall In Love"", ""Talkin' To Me"", ""Can't Let Go"", and ""Need You Tonight"". One of the two ballads on this album that I truly love is ""Nothing Like Loving You"". I wish it was released as a single because it's fits perfectly well in the R&B radio's Quiet Storm vein. This album could've done better saleswise, but, like other new and established female artists, it was overshadowed by the success and craze of Ashanti. This album is a must-have for your music collection."
4,Nothing Like Loving You,Stunning debut from Amerie. Where is she now. This album is hot and Ms. A has a very strong voice. I don't know where she is today. This album was not promoted enough to boost record sales and radio play. I guess that's why people slept on this CD.
4,Sweet,"Finally decided to get this after hearing the positive reviews and digging her vibe. I really like it... Music is crisp and lite.. and so is her voice. Very angelic.Where you guys are coming up with Mary J references, I'll never know. I dont see it. Amerie isnt ghetto and aggressive, with an untrained voice... nor would I consider this CD to be hip hop soul... Mary is good at what she does, but Im scratching my head over the disturbingly overwhelming comparisons to her.Either way, its a good album. My only complaint is that its too damn short.-N."
5,The REAL Princess of Hip Hop and Soul,"Amerie is everything Ashanti is not. Amerie's album is hot. Her voice perfect. She puts her all into every note she sings it is easy to see how the Hip Hop Soul Queen has influenced her. This album really reminds me of Mary's first album ""Whats The 411"". Don't sleep on Amerie. This is a star in the making. Check her out.The Princess of Hip Hop and Soul......Amerie"
5,Classic,I don't think Amerie gets enough credit. The production on this album goes perfectly with her voice and lyrics. All I Have is a true R&B album. Touch is a solid follow-up to this classic.
4,BOOSTED signal in Large Home,"This antenna worked well for me in a large family home. It was hooked up to a Wireless (G) Linksys router. My router is located on the lower level of the house, and I could not establish a stable connection throughout the house. I definately recommend this product to extend the range of the signal. However, you should be aware that network adaptors play a role in this situation. I first had a Linksys USB Wireless adaptor, and it could not pick up the weak signal. I switched to the Netgear WG121 and that established a signal everytime (once I got it finally setup properly).Finally, this product will not work with every wireless router. Make sure to check you router to ensure it has the right type of connector (I don't think this fits most NetGear routers)."
3,6db gain...,"...increased my signal strength, but only a little. I finally went out and bought a new Linksys wireless router with SRX200 and - guess what - it increased my signal strength as well - but only a little. In sum, I believe this antenna works as advertised. But I've learned a lesson: next time I'll simply purchase a repeater (but, too late now!)"
1,made no difference,"Made no difference on signal strength.If you want a different look on your wifi antenna, this is the product. If you want to increase signal strength, then avoid it."
1,Does Nothing,This antenna does not increase the strength or distance of my wireless - b network -- in any position.
1,Light usage and pad comes apart!,"I used to buy Dewalt tools thinking they are going to last a long time without any problems. Not true and replacement parts are seriously overpriced. $22 for a piece of foam and rubber? I expected that at the price I paid for the Dewalt Sander that I should not run into any problems. I've had to replace the Seal twice and now the foam pad twice. I only use it for light woodworking and not that often either. I should have just bought Ryobi at 1/2 the price and would have been money ahead. I really think that with all the problems I've had with Dewalt tools and Dewalt batteries that somewhere along the way Dewalt decided to cheapen everything, live on their reputation for awhile and somebody pocketed the savings from switching to cheap parts and cheap designs. And by the way, this Pad is Made in China."
3,Good Story,"After reading The Jungle, I decided to read this book. Compared to Upton Sinclair's other work of literature, I found that the writing style was very different. Perhaps this story was truly meant to be a play due to it's extensive dialogue. The story does not lack in it's humor. There was always something to laugh about from the beginning till the end."
1,"Great idea, horrible print quality","The book itself has some great concepts and very creative ideas included. It's cute, fun, and looks like it would be a great keepsake once it's completed. Unfortunately though, the print quality was horrible (at least on the book I received, I don't see other complaints so maybe this is a new problem?). The index pages that divide the different years are in a dark ink that transferred all over the place on the facing page, where the photos are supposed to go. The light colors weren't so bad, but the white areas facing the dark pages such as red and purple looked terrible and were covered in large areas of smudgy ink. I am only thankful that this happened BEFORE someone spent a lot of time and effort doing these pages, rather than destroying the photos later on. I also don't see any mention of the book being acid-free, so I wonder how long the ""keepsake"" would have lasted. Sorry, but I have to recommend finding a book with better print quality."
1,"Swing low, make it awful.","I rented this movie just because it was a new release and there wasn't much to choose from that day. I wish I hadn't. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my day, and this is certainly one of the worst ever. I got the feeling it was supposed to be a comedy, except, it wasn't funny at all. Terrible script, bad acting. Rent this movie, and you will regret it."
2,Didn't work for me.,"I really wanted this to work, and hoped to stop using antiperspirants, but I just can't. I put this to the test by showering, applying, and going to yoga class. It wasn't even hot yoga, yet throughout the class I kept noticing a faint odor. Sure, it was subtle, but considering I just had a clean, blank slate - I expected it to at least last through the 60 minute class. I can't imagine if I had gone for a run! I'm surprised by other positive reviews. Am I doing it wrong?"
2,Not for me!,"I know most people buy this for the lack of aluminum, but I bought it because regular deodorant makes my underarm skin dark and thick. Gross, I know. Anyway, I got this to see if it would help and while I have already noticed a lighter appearance in my skin, it's not working out for me. I ended up developing a rash which I've never experienced before. Fortunately I'm not a big sweater, but I did notice some odor by later in the day. I also wasn't a fan of the application. If the stone is too wet it slips around and I feel like I'm not getting any product on me, and if it's too dry it tugs and is uncomfortable.The spray version on the other hand is wonderful. Even if you're like me and didn't like this product, I highly recommend trying the spray."
1,Not Aluminum FREE,"I don't know if you are aware, but All deodorants crystals, crystal deodorant roll-ons, and crystal deodorant sprays contain either: Ammonium Alum, also known as ammonium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate or Potassium Alum, also known as potassium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate. Both potassium and ammonium alum have the same potential toxicity as Aluminum Chlorohydrate there for its an Aluminum salt just like aluminum chlorohydrate. Crystal deodorants are no better for you than antiperspirants containing aluminum chlorohydrate."
2,Good service,"The service was good, I got the item very fast and I like it. However, the case broke and I have had it maybe a month. Too bad they can make a good product but not put it in a decent case. It doesn't really matter though as you can use the product without a case."
3,confused,I really don't get how this deodorant is supposed to work. It does not do anything in my opinion. I rub it but its stiff... there's no odor. Maybe I'm doing something wrong... I'll wait and see...
5,Like a miracle!,"This stuff is wonderful! I finally don't detect a weird funk a couple hours after applying deodorant. Admittedly, I bought this a long time ago, and I tried to use it in place of antiperspirant/deodorant instead of using it WITH one. I used it a couple times and stopped because I was so sweaty. Now I've tried it again and once it dries, I apply my usual antiperspirant and go on my merry way. I smell fresh and my clothes don't get stuck with permanent B.O. I highly recommend this product!"
5,Drowned Wednesday is sure to float with fans,"The latest book in the Keys to the Kingdom series, Drowned Wednesday, is a book that introduces fans to far away places, and cruel magic, where the plot thickens and blood boils. The book is for sure the best so far in the series, with the entire book being solid, save perhaps the ending which defies sanity. Beyond that, this book is an excellent read for any wanting a good childrens' fantasy novel."
3,Why a ps2 case,"I got this game today and found that it came in a play station 2 case don't get me wrong the game is great, works fine and i am happy there are no complaints here just wanted to point them out."
4,GREAT Coffee Machine - Not So Great Service,"The Tassimo is a great coffee maker when it works; however, if yours ever goes out, like mine did recently, it will take you 2 months to get the packaging to send it in to the repair facility that Tassimo uses; then another month to get your machine back. I suggested that the company provide loaners to their devoted customers, but I do not think they took me seriously."
2,Disappointing and getting predictable,"I eagerly looked forward to reading this novel after having read two other works by Stephen Frey. This one was definitely a disappointment. Frey has also stepped partially away from the financial world with this one and seems to be on somewhat unfamiliar ground.Once again the main characters come from impoverished backgrounds that they prefer to hide - where have we heard that before? David Mitchell is almost a cookie cutter copy of Andrew Falcon and Mace McClain, although a bit more suspicious. At least the ending was a bit different from the Frey formula of the previous two books.I would have given this book 1 star except the last 100 pages or so were pretty gripping."
3,Really? Six pills a day?,I really have put my faith into garden of life products. I truly want to believe!! I am on my second bottle. The reason I give 3 stars is that I don't like that you have to take 6 pills a day because I tend to forget to take all six. They are very expensive too. I do think they are high quality vitamins though.
5,THE BEST SUSPENSE NOVEL I READ,"I AM RETIRED AND HAVE AMPLE TIME TO READ NOVELS. MANY NOVELS OF THIS GENRE ARE WRITTEN BY FORMULA AND BECOME DULL. THE AUTHOR HAS USED HIS UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE AND SENSE OF INTRIGUE TO ENTICE AND DELIGHT THE READER. THIS NOVEL IS FULL OF SURPRISES. THE PLOT BEGINS WITH AN EVERYDAY CUSTODY BATTLE FOR CHILDREN AND EVOLVES INTO A WORLD OF EVIL AND CRUELTY.WITH EVERY PAGE, THIS READER WANTED TO SEE REVENGE AND JUSTICE. THE CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK ARE EASY TO IDENTIFY WITH AND I AM EAGER TO READ MR. DAVE'S NEXT BOOK. I TRUST HE WILL CONTINUE TO USE HIS TALENT IN A FRESH AND INVIGORATING STYLE."
1,Battle of the Bulge,"What is the point of reading something like this?There is very very little about Jochen Peiper life,book should be caled""Battle of the Bulge""DO NOT believe everything that is writen there, ESPECIALLY by UK writers or directors. Remember, the winners write the history."
3,The detail clutters the book.,"As previous reviews suggest it is not really about Peiper but about the LAH's role in the Ardenness Offensive. At times the detail is boring - it is a very detailed account of a section of the battle of the Bulge. It is best when it discussess issues such as Peipers knowledge of the Malemy massacres , his murder etc. Reynolds second book (steel inferno) is much better in this respect and is a more free flowing narrative. Reynolds seems to have more affinity with people like Kurt Meyer than Peiper"
4,Great If you want a couple of great tracks...,"I got this CD off a friend and I had it stolen from me when they broke into my vehicle and stole all my audio and every one of my CD's (Geo Tracker... figures). Well This CD is rated 4 because only a couple of tracks are rated as 5 stars on my list. Starting No.1 is DJ Dan - That Ziper Track, this track is made up of so many bad ""a"" sounds blended together in beautiful harmony. If you buy this CD you will enjoy this track. In at number 2 is The Sixth Scense by Wink, this track is silent yet loud a few minutes into the track, a keeper. In at No.3 is Movin' Through your System by Jark Prongo, the song is self explanatory (really deep bass for those bass heads). A must have for collectors. The chiled out songs make it good for variety. Buy it if your open minded. If your a hater go buy your DJ Irene or another sell-out. They know what you like."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Even though you get 2 CDs (24 tracks), it's not worth it! Both 'Bodyrock' and 'Battle Flag' mixes are completely messed up! 'Battle Flag' usually rocks, but they turned it into some kind of slow dreamy space mission song! If you are going to get a Digital Empire series, get DE1. It's the best out of the three."
1,This product didn't work and the manufacturer won't help!,"I bought the Cuisipro Stay Cool Rolling Pin in hopes of a new product to help with all my Thanksgiving pies. I followed all instructions and yet the water leaked out when trying to roll out the dough. I tried varying levels of water in the rolling pin to see if it would help but it didn't.I've emailed the manufacturer twice to find out what I could do to help make the product work or to replace it but they have not contacted me. Does this mean I've just wasted about $40? I sure hope not but unless they contact me, I'm just another sucker!"
5,EXCELLENT,"This book is a must for anyone who is interested in Slavic epic poetry. Unfortunately, I am unable to read these works in the Serbian. However, the editors have translated beautifully. There is no awkward attempt to catch the rhyme or meter, which so often ruins poetry in translation. Of all the translations of the Serbian epics which I have encountered (and I look for them diligently. . .), this one is the best. The translators' sensitivity to nuance and meaning allows you, the English reader, to experience these works as best as you possibly can without reading Serbian. Highly recommended."
1,Flimsy -- Buyer Beware,"I bought this sofa to serve both as a chair and bed, to be used daily.Day two of chair use, I sat down on the end with the arm rest at my left and heard a sharp ""twang."" I lifted the futon to investigate, but found nothing.Night two of bed use, I noted that I was now sleeping on a slope. Apparently the metal frame has bent somewhere.I'm 5'10"", 200 lbs. Imagine if I were married and there were two of us trying to sleep on this thing....-----Four days have passed. I'm now sleeping in a bucket (or so it feels). Sitting on the couch yields the same sensation. The wood frame near the left armrest as you sit has broken. This part of the frame is actually several pieces of wood glued together instead of a single piece.I've downgraded my rating from two stars to one and changed the title from ""Flimsy"" to ""Flimsy -- Buyer Beware."""
2,unsubstantial,Bought 03/03/2012 and the frame is already cracked in the front making it unsuitable for sitting. Assembly is not as easy as claimed.
1,Every one broking,"Everyone of the Imex cases I brought you, and you sent me were broking, but said quality check. Who's doing the checking???. Reason I didn't return them, is because it cost just as much postage as they cost, and want make any sense. I want be doing busines with you any more. That's a good way to take care of this problem, yes every one I bought"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"There is a serious programming flaw in this game. A ""warning"" window pops up every few minutes (unless your PSP is fully charged AND plugged in!). This is INCREDIBLY annoying and I am returning the game. The manufacturer won't even acknowledge that there is a problem so I am NEVER buying another UBISOFT product again!"
1,"IF I COULD, I'LL GIVE IT NEGITIVE CENTILLION!","This is the absolutely the dumbist sudoku game EVER!The game started out fine. Relaxing music, you choose the difficulty, style, and then you play. Well I put a wrong number in one of the boxes...Then it TELLS YOU THAT YOU PUT IN THE WRONG NUMBER!!! WhAt?! No! Nuh-uh! That defeates the WHOLE GAME! WHATS THE POINT IN PLAYING SUDOKU IF IT JUST TELLS YOU THE ANSWER?!I think I made my point...And oh yea, centillion has 303 zerros, just in case anyone wonders about that."
3,"Useful, but a product of its own era.","For a more balanced portrayal of what the Iroquois and Algonquin leaders did well, I recommend Stephen Saunders Webb's more recent '1676: The End of American Independence'."
2,Ugly Duckling lackluster,I thought this was a record with the original Danny Kaye (or otherwise) Ugly Duckling songs. The songs featured in this small vinly record are not what we grew up with. Very disappointing.
2,you canot use it for when baby sleeps,"I'm sure people are buying this product thinking it's great to prevent your baby from getting a flat head. But if you read the fine print on the product when you actually get it, it says that you shouldn't use it except for when maybe is semi upright (like strollers).Also, I've noticed that the base of DD's skull is now more raised compared to the rest of her head. My theory is that because the hole is small, she tends to actually smash her head on the bottom of the boppy and so as the skull grows, it gets pushed out.oh well."
3,Not sure if it works for an older infant,"My baby boy is four and half months old and he developed a complete flat head . We bought this product yesterday and I am using it in his carseat, stroller, swing and rocker. He seems to be comfortable in it. If I had purchased this product when he was only two or three months old , I think it might have worked well. Since he is more than 4 months old, and since he developed a complete flat head three months back itself, I am not sure if his head will come back to normal. I hope this thing helps him get better."
4,So far so good,"I bought this for my little guy (5 month old) because he has flat head syndrome. I bought it for the car seat because I travel 80 mile round trip to work and daycare daily, so he spends more time in his carseat than I'd like. So far so good, he is comfortable with it, and it keeps his head straighter than before. I have only had it a short time so it is to soon to see a major difference, but I'm pleased with the product."
1,Unattractive but reasonably functional,"Our pediatrician recommended it for avoiding a flat spot on the back of baby's head. Keeps baby's head reasonably in place, but the angle and configuration of the car seat is more important in this regard. Velcro strap holders aren't very secure and keep coming off the straps, not a huge deal. Denim is ugly and doesn't match any baby stuff we own (do you own a denim stroller, swing, or chair?) We keep it in our car seat since that's where he spends a lot of time. For our baby jogger, we use the Kidapottamus Snuzzler since it surrounds a newborn and supports baby's head more effectively."
1,not so good support,I have been using the boppy denim noggin nest for one week on my son (10 weeks). I also noticed the grove at the bottom of his scull from the hard part of the Noggin Nest. It is round and has the same shape as the botton part of the Nest. BE VERY CAREFUL AND CHECK YOUR BABY'S HEAD OFTEN IF YOU ARE USING THIS PRODUCT.
5,GREAT book...a joy to read!,"The book is fascinating and makes you think. You can hardly put it down. It is a book you can refer to time and time again. My husband doesn't enjoy reading and doesn't read books, but he has almost finished Marta's book...he laughs out loud at the funny and touching stories and many times I hear him saying ""Wow, interesting..."" I recommend this book to everyone that loves animals."
4,good but a little hard.,"When I think about it I should've got the first book.I also got the cd and tapes, but it don't say the words or the meaning of the words so it's very hard to understand."
3,Its pretty pointless.,The character workbook is very pointless the way the characters are shown is dumb. The book is basically a bunch of boxes. I bought this book and didn't use it. There isn't many boxes for you to practice. I feel you might as well buy the textbook and get a sheet of grid paper and do it yourself because this is a pointless book.
2,Proceed with caution!,"I purchased this book despite the negative reviews.I must agree though. The book gives short shrift to most of Wright's buildings in Arizona. I had been hoping for more on the elusive Harold Price, Sr. home.Particularly egregious however is that the author refers to Brendan Gill as Wright's preeminent biographer (page 33). This is laughable. Gill's book would be about the bottom of any credible list of accurate, informative books on Wright. Gill had an ax to grind, which tarnishes every page and skewers every viewpoint. That the author ADMIRES Gill's book is a cautionary warning."
4,Folk Music Lives!,"For those of us who hung out in coffeehouses in the 60's and 70's, this books brings us back together. It is wonderful to know that some of my folk heroes live on through Nanci Griffith's ambitious project. She has gathered some of the finest musicians/songwriters and this book speaks for them and from them. It is a great companion to the two CD's and a wealth of insights on why Nanci chose the particular songs. For me, it was also a good way to become better acquainted with this woman of artistry and vision. Enjoy, folk lovers!"
2,Less than impressed,"I found this book to be somewhat helpful, but less so than I had hoped. I was quite surprised to find the book poorly edited, (to say the least!) with several typos, the body pieces for one of the patterns mislabeled, and general inconsistencies in the way the diagrams are labeled. Still, the book did give a basic outline of the steps involved in designing a bear--although there are blaring gaps, such as giving SOME proportions, but not all: the body in general should be twice as high as the head, yet no mention of how wide the body should be (about 2/3 the height, by the way) . So I would say this is a book which will get you started, but may leave you with a few unanswered questions. And, as I said, the book is quite poorly written and edited-maybe a second edition will be forthcoming which will be improved."
5,The first book to tell all on how to design your own bears!,"About time we had such a great book. It tells all you need to know on how to draft your own patterns and how to make real artist bears. Good tips on setting up your own business etc. Easy to follow, and includes great patterns as a bonus! Highly recommended."
1,UNBELIEVEABLE,"I saw that and read the description numerous times. Surely itwas a typo or I was missing something important. Nope. It's made out of NYLON for God's sake. Nylon, the man made fiber that theymake parachutes out of. Then I saw the 5 star review came from someone in SF CA. It's all beginning to make sense now. P.T. Barnum was right!"
4,Vedic basics made easy.,"This is a condensed comprehensive translation and elucidation of the 18 verses of the vedic Sri (shree) Ishopanishad. The Upanishads are texts of prayer and guidance for people in all the different walks of life. The Sri Ishopanishad is meant for those most developed and inquisitive about finding and developing devotion to God. Begining from a general statement describing the qualities of the supreme, through to a prayer of personal surrender, this collection of short prayer/meditations very meticulously leads one into the realm of devotion to God in exquisite detail. Although sometimes logical to the point of clinical, it is none the less, devotional personalism in its best form, written and translated by a most erudite and devoted practioner of its line."
3,"If someone knows how to pronounce this, e-mail me.","This book does some work explaining and elaborating on the 18 mantras of Sri Isopanisad. He takes a look at where we stand as flawed physical sentient beings within the cycles of repeated death and birth, plus how to break away from that, the material plane, and the law of Karma. He says that the only solution to our problems is a God-centered life, and spiritual knowledge, as opposed to material- which leads to 'nescience.' Summed up, this book is about uniting with God, through the guide of a teacher, and ending the painful process of rebirth.The book has some nice images as well, and while reading I was entranced into the painting of the stages of birth and death. Also, if the ideas of this book is where you want to take your life, then there is also a final section on Krishna Consciousness at Home.My favorite mantra was number seven =)..."
5,"wow, it just went out on me","I bought this battery 2 years ago. My daughter is a picture taking fool. It now just went out on me.. A great bargain for more than 1/2 the cost of buying it in the name of the ""name brand giant"". To be honest... I would not doubt if it is the same thing. Side by side they appear the same."
2,poor quality,"The movie is a good one to watch, however the quality of this film is very poor. The movie is so faded and scratchy it distracts from the story. The audio is so poor, I had watch it at least twice to catch the dialogue. I dont recommend that you buy this. I would search out a better copy. The only good thing about this movie, is that it was cheap to buy, but now I know why."
5,Some background.,"This isn't some band that Uematsu hired to do his music; this is HIS band. He organized the Black Mages, and the keyboard parts you hear are him playing.This is extremely good music, as progressive rock goes. Not being much of a fan of the genre myself, I can't give an opinion from a critical standpoint, but I must say that I quite enjoyed this CD. This is the sort of music that your idiot friends won't believe is from a game."
5,Read and enjoy,"First, I am not a Spanish speaker... but I can read Spanish with a dictionary nearby. Second, I am easy to please with a translation as all I want basically is a ""trot"" to save me time looking up words and figuring out grammar. I think that if the translator spends years trying to present the poet's works in a truly accurate manner in English that usually means the translator has re-created (which leaves this puzzled reader wondering just who is the author of the poem). Happily, this translation does not attempt a re-creation nor does it force the poem into what would likely be absurd contortions to make it rhyme in English. It is literal enough for interlinear readers like me. One can always quibble over word choice (e.g., Appetence for Codicia, which sent me to the dictionary) but overall the reading is easy and a great pleasure."
5,Amazing,"This cd is unlike anyhting I have ever heard. It derserves so much more attention then it has gotton, this is simply great music, it is 90's soul. It lifts up ones spirit to antoher level, and has a great energy, best of all every song is great so i can just let it play"
3,Well Written...,"...and goes well with his DVD. The text is definitely geared toward beginners. However if you're new at this, the photos of jewelry (albeit lovely) are a little intimidating. I'll use this book as a reference source for techniques, but I'm looking to Stephen O'Keeffe's ""Jewelry Making"" for projects I can actually achieve."
3,"Fundamentals, where are you?","Before starting to work with metal, the first important thing to do is to lay out a workshop, to choose a workbench (and a good workbench lamp!),the basic tools and large equipment.But Tim like most others authors of jewelry making books don't explain out to set up a workshop.He directly teach you how to work with precious metal.There is no photo of drawing bench (only draw plates) or rolling mill (you see only the rollers) or wax injector and also of workbench.Incredible!"
3,"Good, but not the best",I have purchased this book to learn about the fundamentals of metalsmithing. Unfortunatelly in most cases the final product is shown and only theoretical description is provided without pictures or description of tools needed. The book is more theoretical than practical and other literature is needed in order to get a full idea of what is needed and how job gets done.
4,Pretty good,the brace is great and really sturdy its significantly improves your ability to move around on the court without causing move damage to you ankle. it help to tie the brace more tightly around the ankle area and above rather then the toes
1,return policy stinks,I tried to return this item 31 days after i bought it and unable to do so.product runs large too so beware of that also. Great that i have a new pair of these never worn that i cant use :(
1,available for free,"You can get these for free at most auto parts stores. Normally hang on rack where filters or located. Auto Zone, Advance Auto, Oriellys"
1,still listed but my order canceled,I ordered this item for my Mom for Mother's Day. Got an email that it has been cancelled but is still listed for sale!!!Hope I can find something that will get there in time!
3,Beware of the IGP-345M chipset!,"I have is another Sony Vaio with the display chipset ATI-IGP-345Mwhich uses shared system ram for video. When I attemped to run some games, the first one complained about the sony drivers level (which are dated mid-2003). When I contacted ATI, they told me that I should contact the system manufacturer. When I contacted Sony inquiring about the availability of updated video drivers, they told me that they only support software that comes bundled with the notebook, and nothing else. (!!).Not to mention that ATI's IGP-345M linux support is muddy at best (ATI should be ashamed for their lack of linux support). That's the reson why I am giving my Sony vaio to my father as a gift, and getting a new notebook for myself. This time, I'll be very careful to choose one with a REAL video chipset (a full Radeon 9700 or 9800) with dedicated video memory instead of this ""shared ram"" gimmick."
4,excellence,this is a great computer i have 1 i should know!!!!!!!!!! it has excellent speed and good hard drive space good 4 school projects and presentations!
5,great,"great product ,easy to clean ! i m abusy mom but this is a great product .I wish it will come in a smaller size to !!!"
3,Small!,"Quality and color is good, but was very disappointed with how tiny this colander is! But I will keep it for small jobs."
2,96 pages of filler,"Is this how the Double Diamond Triangle Saga functions? By lumbering noisily through every single plot point? This segment could be reduced to 20 pages, instead it's 96. Kern and Miltiades, so interesting in ""Pool of Twilight"", are here now reduced to squarejawed paladin stereotypes and are barely interesting. The way Piergeiron's illness is introduced is so amateurish that it seems like an afterthought. The tanar'ri subplot (since when does 96 pages allow suplots?) is incredibly dull, and our nominal hero is too klutzy for us to believe he would be sent on a rescue mission under any circumstances. And didn't anyone notice that a paladin dies solely because Kern's resistance to magic didn't allow Khelben to teleport him? Disappointing."
3,I really wanted...'glow in the dark' pinstripe tape,"I've been looking for very thin glow in the dark tape. Unfortunately, this was 'reflective' only and needs light in order to be seen. I wanted 'glow in the dark' tape to see item in the dark where there is NO light! Still looking...I found some 1/2"" wide that glows real well...but it's too wide for my uses. I also use glow in the dark collars for my pups so I don't trip over them in the middle of the night! A lifesaver!!"
3,fun but creepy,the instructor keeps staring at me -- still the work out was fun and my kids had fun dancing around the room too
5,Seth,Very good. Product. Had been looking for one of these but never found quite the right one. I would recommend this.
4,Great product,"Very practi al small waist pack. It is room, but not to gig to carry & I do really like the water holder."
1,Too small for my Axe-FX,"This unit is too small for my Axe-FX - a 2U unit. Accordingly, I'm not able to affix the back end on this case. This leaves my Axe-FX exposed. Don't buy this case."
5,"Finally, the Ant & the Aardvark cartoons are here!!!","I watched the Pink Panther, when I was a kid, just to see The Ant & The Aardvark and the Inspector cartoons!! I could have cared less about the Pink Panther. Every A&A cartoon is on this disc and in unedited condition. Meaning not made politically correct like many of the cartoon classics being released these days. The cartoons are every bit as good as I remember them. Now how about releasing the Inspector cartoons?!"
4,hilarious,"hadn't watched the aardvark cartoons in more than 20 years, since i was a kid. one of the funniest least politically correct cartoons of it's time."
3,Excelentes videos pero extraño sus voces,"Compré este video porque son parte de las caricaturas que veía de niño, lástima que no vienen con el doblaje al español, el cual es excelente. Extrané la voz desparpajada del Oso Hormiguero y la cómica voz de la hormiga. Nunca los había escuchado en inglés y la verdad se oyen muuuuy planos."
5,Pink Panther Friends Classic Cartoon Collection,The video was perfect when I received it. I bought it for my Dad for his 82nd birthday. He has since passed away. He loved the Pink Panther. He enjoyed this movie so much.
4,salad bowl finish,works okay. leaves a semi smooth finish. Drys quickly. A small can covers a lot. price is fair for the amount it covers.
2,Disappointing,"We LOVED this toy back in the day, but this new version is a cheap disappointment. The pole does not stay in its positioner in the base very well. It pops out frequently. The ""old school"" zim zam that has a pole that you drive into the ground is MUCH better."
3,Not So Much Fun,"Unfortunately, as much as I hate to give negative reviews; I am going to have to rate this not very high. This used to be lots of fun. However, the latest one that I have ordered is not holding up very well. The middle pole pops out and it seems very flimsy.I glanced over the other reviews and it appears that others are not having the same problems? Maybe we simply got a poorly put together set?The concept is good. We really liked this when we had it previously. However, this one seems flimsy and could be better built."
5,Wonderful and Life-changing!,I have read this book several times during the past few years. My father died when I was seven - I am now 49. The Lord has used this book to bless me and help heal me of hurts that resulted from this loss. I still remember when I read it for the first time. I felt as though someone understood! This is a beautiful and comforting book. Very well written. The author really points the reader to Jesus Christ Who is the only Healer and the best Father of all! I have shared this book with several others who have had similar experiences.
3,Ok i guess,I have been using the extra light for about 3 weeks and the high E string snapped on the 15th fret while i was bending it.
2,Not good.,"I am usually a big Ernie Ball fan, but these are bad. They are so stiff, it is hard to bend and you have to file your nut down to use them. I normally use the ones one size below these, and those are fantastic. Even in dropped tuning they are stiff and hard to Barre"
3,"Sound is ok, but lifespan is somewhat short.","Sound is ok, but lifespan is somewhat short compared to better, pricier strings. This is a budget item, no more, no less, and guitarists worldwide know what I mean by that. If not, I mean that people buy this if they are strapped for cash or on a very slim budget for equipment and upgrades. What is unfair is the price of many of the more reliable strings manufactured by companies of similar renown. The companies seem to have an awareness that they can overcharge for both subpar and adequate product, because supply exceeds demand in the music industry."
1,Dont use with a tremolo bridge,"pulls up my tremolo bridge on my strat. i replaced the springs and got another pack to put on but it messed up the new springs too. absolutely terrible, never stays in tune. hate these strings."
3,Pre-Algerba,"I guess my idea of what is acceptable is different from what we got. The book is beat up and thrashed. It is still usable but, barely..."
2,Romantic Suspense,"Back cover:To Juana Brett the summons from her grandmother in Portugal appeared to be only an invitation to revisit the beloved scenes of her childhood. She did not know that the familiar castle on the lonely cliffs of Cabo Roca had become the secret meeting place of spies and terrorists. Nor that she herself was to be caught up in a fantastic web of intrigue that had wound itself around her family.From the moment Juana learned about the winding stair that led to the hidden rooms beneath the castle, she became part of the nightmare conspiracy that threatened everyone she loved.But it was Juana herself who became the unexpected target of the madmen who dared not trust her with the secret of THE WINDING STAIR.===============================================================================================I am a fan of Jane Aiken Hodge's other books, and did not find this one to be as well written as some of her other work."
1,warning: these are not the old swaddlers!,"HiI was buying from amazon the last few months.. and at my last order, i saw the packet looked much thinner.. Looking closely, it was a ""grow with me fit"" of the swaddlers that has much less padding compared to the ""custom fit"" ones that I was getting before.Amazon has lowered back to the original price of 7.49 but have changed the product offering.. I did not expect this from amazon.we should have been alerted to this change."
2,"Great fit, but wetness stays on the surface","I tried these diapers with my son. They were a great fit, but all the wetness stayed on the surface, making him more prone to diaper rash. So, I wouldn't recommend them."
5,A good purchase,"These are clear, easy to read medicine dosage cups. I would recommend them to anyone that needs them. The price was right, and shipping was fast."
3,Just an OK product,I don't like this product as much because the powder doesn't really dissolve very well in the water. It settles to the bottom of the glass before you can finish drinking it. You have to keep putting more water in your glass in order to get it all down and even then there is some left in the glass.
5,TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"...""Even against the greatest of odds,there is something in the human spirit, a magic blend of skill, faith, and valor that can lift men from certain defeat to incredible victory.""This inspiring book about Dr. Dardik's s intuivie genius and his lifelong committment to achieving his dream and gift the world with the keys to maximizing personal health is a priceless gift and a must read for anyone enlightend in personal achievement - in health, career, relationship, science. Roger Lewin's eloquence and voice brings you into the tumult of lives well lived in achieving ultimate victory over all obstacles. Dardik's superwave, Alison Godfrey, and the pioneers/entrepaneurs woven throughout this book - what else can I say - get- read it- make waves a part of your life ---live long and prosper. I know from personal experience, and am blessed to have this knowledge. Thank you, Dr. Dardik, Alison, and Roger."
3,Bad aftertaste! Try Adora chocolate calcium supp at Whole Foods,These chews do provide calcium but the aftertaste is awful. I just discovered Adora calcium supplements at Whole Foods. They are made with real chocolate and have vitamin D and K as well. They taste great. No aftertaste. My doctor recommended them. I gave them a try and now I feel I must spread the word. If there is a Whole Foods Market near you - you have to try them!
5,Totally Satisfied,Thank you;This product arrived far faster than expected. It was of top quality. The Teacher in my department for whom it was purchased was delighted to be able to use it for her instruction.
1,Chocolate War The Movie,The movie is HORRIBLE! The book was a excellent but the movie just didn't cut it and not just because it didn't follow the plot of the book but just because it followed no plot at all and was bland old and yuk.
1,Bored and too elemental,A too long book for very few new ideas. It could be very interesting for dummies but too basic for people with marketing knowledge
5,"a sense of duty: my father, my american journey",i enjoyed this book vey much. being a veteran of the vietnam war it helped me to understand the vietnamese side to the war more than i had before. i salute quang x pham for delivering his account in such an honest trully interesting way.semper fi
5,Finally a Doctor who talks to us and not AT us!,"As a businessman doing business in the always hostile Russian Far East, I am constantly put into severe situations of a dangerous and stressful nature. In seeking advice on handling the anxiety and stress that come with such situations, it was such a refreshing change to read a book that is written from a perspective of understanding and compassion. No ""down talking"" lectures, but straight talking help for everyone dealing with anxiety, depression or stress. Many of the business partners and friends I have in Russia suffer from severe depression due to the heavy use of alcohol and their living environment. Understanding their needs and situation will certainly help in my work and friendships. Having a Medical Doctor affirm the status of gay and lesbians and the depression that often effects our lives is also a great help to us all! Thank You Dr. Gardner!"
1,Missing some basics,"I bought this book in the bookstore after making a general flip through it for content. I wish now I had looked a little closer. It's missing some words that you would think would be fundamental and perfect for a pocket reference. Months, days of the week, basic verbs like to know and to think, the list really is quite long of things that are missing. But then inexplicably it has words like kleptomania, lunar and a some other quite bizarre ones for a pocket reference. All in all, I'd say going looking for another reference. Although I will agree with another reviewer that the verb conjugation table is handy, this one isn't worth the money."
3,Buddy key cabinet,Good cabinet if security is not a priority. Door probably could be opened with a screwdriver given a little bit of time. The numbered hooks that come with the cabinet aren't very sturdy but I really didn't expect better. I removed the hook assembly and installed my own key ring hook bars with very good results. All in all I am okay with the cabinet and would buy another provided of course security wasn't a major concern.
2,Pay more for Swaddlers - it's worth it,"We tried the Baby Dry when our baby was younger. He woke up wet a few times in the middle of the night (as he did with Huggies & Luvs too.)When Amazon was selling Swaddlers for $7.49 we tried them instead & have been hooked ever since. The're much more custom-fitted & we have NO leaky diapers anymore. Swaddlers hold everything in! Better yet, they keep our baby feeling dry (even though he's not) & comfortable.Now the Swaddlers price has gone up on Amazon but you can still find good deals on Swaddlers @ Sams, Costco & when they're on sale @ the grocery store. We won't buy anything other than Swaddlers - it's not worth it!"
5,awesome,I am really glad I bought these dvds. Tamilee kicks butt! She is very easy to follow and she does not sound all silly or corny giving instruction. I am working up a sweat. With eating right and doing these dvds you will lose weight. Its great to finally find something that is quick and effective.
4,Raw power,"Although the sound quality between tracks varies, this compilation, compared to the somewhat sanitised productions of the first two studio albums, is closer to how Yes really sounded in 1969-1970. Unrestrained, raw and energetic. Good stuff. Of interest to fans of early Yes only. (You know, the greying & balding ones.)"
4,Communicating for managerial effectiveness,This book examines theories and techniques employed by communication professionals in large organisations. It provides an opportunity to assess these theories and techniques by applying them to an analysis of communication practices within specific organisations and examining an organisations external communication.Ideal read or textbook if interested in or studying concepts that exist within small or large organisations or seeking to improve communication within their own organisation.
2,Have to return,"I carefully read the reviews and though I am a size 8 I went for the 7. The length was right but for the first time in my life they were too narrow. I always have the opposite problem. I could probably try to break them in for $19.99 but they are not real leather and there were some pretty ouchy rubbing places because of the synthetic materials. I could not see them softening up. The user that posted the velcro strps weren't long enough, I agree. Though there was about a quarter to a half inch leeway at my toe the heel strap did not overlap as much as I expected it to which it should have because my heels are really narrow."
1,Sandals,"Ordered women's sandals (said so in the description), but received MEN's sandals. :( In picture they look almost white and gray. They were camel colored and black. Not what I expected."
4,Comfortable for hot days,"I have been wanting to purchase golf sandles for a while and found the best price on Amazon. The shoes came quickly and are of good quality. The only thing I might do different is order 1/2 size smaller. They seem a bit big, but I kept them anyway. The extra length does not bother me and the width was just right."
2,doesnt replace my tk-10,i bought this version to be less bulky ...i have had 3 of these and the clicker to turn it on goes out in less than 4 months ..2 manufacture replacementsdo not recommend for the everyday user ..mite be useful in a emergency bag not worth the price as the full size tk-10 witch is still going sence 2007
3,Outdated design and materials,"This case is made from heavy sheets of plywood and weighs a lot. The hardware is all metal. The interior is a very nice plush shaggy material, but not particularly well-fitted to my stratocaster. The example I got was defective. The lid was off a few millimeters, so you had to push it to the side to get the latches to engage. (bought from another vendor, not Amazon) I returned it, and bought a plastic case.Years ago when this was the only choice you would need to put up with it, but now there are cases that will protect your guitar just as well with slightly less cost and a lot less weight. If you're a real traditionalist though don't let this review stop you. The case is fine and seems to have worked out for thousands of guitarists over half a century."
3,Not Like the Old Formula - a review of Suave Naturals Lavender Shampoo,"Well, you aren't going to believe it, but I think Suave has changed their time-honored formula -- at least for some of their shampoos :(I mean I've been using Suave shampoo for decades and have always liked it. Here, for example is a link to my favorite Strawberry scented shampoo where I gave it 4-Stars:Suave Naturals Shampoo, Fresh Mountain Strawberry - 22.5oz.Thus far it remains the same.However, I'm here to tell you that the Lavender is no longer as sudsy as it used to be .And. in fact, it doesn't clean quite as well. Now I don't know whether this is a result of the addition of the vitamins and whatnot, or whether they are just trying to make us use more shampoo... but I'm not overly happy, and I'm using the rest of bottle as hand and body wash.Pam T~"
3,A helpful study tool.,"The purpose of this book is to help us understand the idioms used in the Bible.Part One is broken down into books by order;Genesis first etc..A phrase and location are listed with a translation.An example-Gen.49:24 ""His bow abode in strength"" means he will become a valiant warrior.Some of the translations in this book are ""off the mark"" in my opinion.The number 666 meaning Nero Caesar.The Sons of God from Genesis 6 being Seth's descendants.These ideas are debatable.A Key to the original Gospels(Part Two of the book) has some interesting information.""Eli,Eli,Lmana Sabachthani"" the phrase uttered my Messiah shortly before his death is rendered-""My God,my God,for this I was kept.""Mr.Lamsa may have went a bit too far looking for symbolic meaning in passages that have a literal meaning.While I don't think that this book is without error, it has value as a tool for studying some difficult idioms."
2,A Lot To Be Desired With This Book,"This book reads like a book of lists, whereas I wanted a book that would go into the social context in a more explainative way. I was very disappointed."
2,Idioms in the Bible Explained and A Key to the Original Gospels,"I was very disappointed in this book. I was expecting more of a Jewish understanding of the idioms from the culture of the time. However, most of his explanations appear to be a watering down of the gospels and his own opinions obviously slant his definitions of the idioms. Some of his explanations are just stating the obvious and offer no further insight. Don't waste your money."
3,It's OK,"I am enjoying this book, defiantly not because it is all truth, but because it is very interesting to see how people thought back in 1931, there is a lot that is very comical, for ex: he says Ezekiel 16:26 ""and you whored with the sons of Egypt, your neighbours, great of the flesh. And you increased your whoring to provoke me.So he says that ""Great of the flesh"" Means ""men of large sex organs"" I'm pretty sure that God doesn't care how big a man's sex organ are?? and it probably means that they were doing a lot of wickedness as were the Egyptians, worshipping false gods.Because the verse before, vs 25 talks about high places and that is were most everybody worshipped their gods.Their is a lot that are just not real idioms. But still the book is ok, not something you sit down and read in one sitting. And we must remember that they didn't have the greatest of translations or the internet were we can actual look things up in the Hebrew language to see what is really meant."
3,"Good for what it provides, but definitely not worth the money.","This item is okay, but certainly not worth the money. This is a $4.99-$5.99 range book without a doubt."
5,GREAT QUALITY,"I ORDER THIS WALLET FOR MY HUSBAND FOR HIS BIRTHDAY. HIS LAST WALLET CAME FROM ITALY AND FINALLY GAVE OUT AFTER SIX YEARS. THIS WAS A GREAT REPLACEMENT. IT IS SUPER SOFT LEATHER AND WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY THAT IT COST. THE EXPRESSION"" YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"" APPLIES HERE."
4,Good purchase,"Purchased this a a gift for my husband. Lovely leather wallet, if just a little bit soft...Otherwise lovely quality...."
1,Product not as specified by manufacturer,"APC website lists specs for the P8VT3 surge suppressor as: UL 1449 TVSS Rating 330V.The product I received is labeled as P8VT3, but is clearly stamped as 400V (L-N) and 500V (L-G and N-G).I shopped specifically for a unit with 330V clamp rating. This is a lower quality 400/500V suppressor.Returning to Amazon for refund. Referring APC to the FTC and BBB for false advertising.PS: DEAR AMAZON: Please move this review of the P8VT3 to the P8VT3 product."
2,Not What I Expected,"Description failed to include that the bristles were not steel, thus does not remove everything left on the grill from cooking."
3,Worth Reading But Keep in Perspective,"This is definitely worth reading, but there is very little in the way of new ideas. These are the musings of an experienced, worldly individual but they are one man's insights. Worth keeping in perspective along with the views of other authors. Tends to be repetitive."
3,good intro but lacks detail,"When buying this book I was impressed with the broad amount of different cultures and symbols used. While there is a lot of visual references listed, there would be times that I would question how much this author really knew about certain subjects, and in some cases I could have seen where better visual representations could have been used. I was also disappointed in the section covering Japan, and felt it had missed some key points. So while this may be a good place to start, I would not take all the information to heart."
2,How to make the most famous art in the world boring,"The only reason this has two stars is that the photography makes it a little better. This is a padded, ridiculous and over-blown piece that purports to be the true story of arguably the most famous painting in the world. It contains maybe 7 minutes of substance - all the rest is silly. For serious lovers, or students, of art, don't bother. Google will give you better information than this inane offering does."
5,"A ""MUST HAVE""","If you like a little bit Tori you're gonna love her in this blu-ray, although the video are 2 live concerts (piano solo) the way she plays and sings is unbelievable and incredible GOOD. She is very talented and beautiful (kind of Hot).I really love her!!!!!!!Thank you Tori for editing and producing this blu-ray.It is a must have video.DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THIS BLU-RAY (or DVD).Blu-ray quality 1080i excelent resolution!!!!....., Audio DTS Extraordinary as well."
5,Very dependable for YEARS of use,"I have owned this duel purpose curling iron/flat iron for years, and really appreciated it especially when I travel. In all honesty, I find the flat iron a bit tedious to use because you have to hold the handle down and it strains your hands a bit, and when I'm at home I use a Conair flat iron that I'm very happy with. I use the curling iron 365 days a year, and am perfectly happy with it. However, the magic of this appliance really comes into play when traveling. So as not to have to travel with two appliances, this combo is PERFECT for the job. After a good solid 5 years of use, the latch that you use to lock the plates together to make it into a curling iron broke, so now I'll instantly buy another. I cannot live without this!"
5,Conair Iron and Straightener,"Great product, at least good for the money. I'm from Europe so I had do do some modifications because of the different voltages but this iron works in 100-240V range, so no problems here. My girlfriend is very happy with this product."
4,Reliable Iron and Straightener,I have owned one of these iron/straighteners previously and was looking to replace my old one because the locking mechanism broke. I like the convenience of the 2-in-1 product but wish it was better made.
1,Good price but that about it,"It works ok but have had a few things wrong. The screws fell out. & the straightener is good but curler is not, they both pull your hair. Not something I would tell friends to buy but for the price it isnt tooooo bad.."
3,Great product if purchased reputably,"First of all, I felt compelled to write a review on this specific product because in no lifetime should this curler/straightener cost over $200. I have attempted to contact the seller and received no reponse regarding the price--I just wanted to know if this was really the price, or if it was a typo. But no response.Anyway, the reason I titled the review as I did is because I've used this product for ten years or so, off and on. And it's the best out there for both straightening and curling when it's a brand new device. The last time I ordered from Amazon, it was a refurbished model, and it was falling apart within a year. I didn't notice in the product description any mention of it being refurbished, so wherever you get this product, be mindful of this possibility, especially now that it has been discontinued."
5,"wow,wow,wow","i am so happy i got it , great value, works perfectly: fast and makes me look like i just stepped from Hair Salon; you will be not disappointed at all; i use it every day, no complains just wow, wow, wow from people who see the gorgeous results of this item;"
3,This Movie STINKS,"Okay, I have seen the horrid reviews for this movie and now I believe them. The only untrue thing I read was that adults couldn't stand it for much more than an hour. It was only a little under half an hour before my mom started to crack.Being a fan of the series (I watch it on Toon Disney whenever I can), I expected the movie to be ten times better. It was a thousand times worse. The film got to be EXTREMELY tedious and boring by the time an hour was up. When the line in the ending song, ""A film needs an end,"" came up, I thought, ""Yes, yes it does! And right now!""Most of the songs STINK. ""A Whole Lotta World,"" or whatever it was called, annoyed me to no end. The only ones I would keep areI Wanna Be a Boy (Intro)Small but MightyI, Ivan KrankI'm Moving OnProud to be a Dog (Ending)I gave this two stars for some humor plus an extra for the bonus episode, ""Muttamorphasis,"" included on the DVD."
3,Kings,"""Kings"" is an enjoyable story ,even though the series needed more seasons to do a better job of telling it's story.I would like,as I'm sure many other viewers would also, to see a new King taking over. And to see how things would have developed under his rule.Most people would probably prefer to see David Shephard take over as the new King. A few people might prefer the old king's son, Jack, maybe.I know I would have loved to see how much things would have changed with King David in a second season of the show.No such luck, thanks to unreliable TV ratings, most likely."
5,Kim Kardashian....I SALUTE YOU!,"In an age of popular Reality ""Cow Mind Pie"" Shows....and when a no-talent and bore like Kim Kardashian can simply slip on her slim and lift body girdle and slap on some lip gloss....and become an iconic American star and clothing line.WELL...haha....It comes as no shock that something done with any cerebral stimulation, excellence and class would.... JUST....HAVE....TO....BE....CANCELED!Like an oasis on a desert.What a wonderful and welcome surprise ""Kings"" is."
2,*** Don't Bother ***,"I'll start by saying I didn't buy this, but I did watch every episode as they broadcast. Although the show was great, if you buy it, you'll be greatly disappointed to find, as many NBC series go, there was no ending to it. It is one that they left completely open for the next season but cut the show in the off season and left most of the questions of the show unanswered."
4,Matchmakers,"A 3-disc series made for cable has Amy Lindsey and Tiffany Bolton operating a high end dating service. It's a bit hard to accept that their clients have any trouble finding mates, and that they all have sex on their first dates, but that's the secret of their success. Glen Meadows is the lucky guy who keeps it all together, and everyone but him eventaully gets naked. Good acting, good sets, and believable actors set this one above."
2,"Beginning guide to the API, after that you're on your own","This book is a reasonable introduction to the APIs to create and use SWT and JFace widgets. It will not help you get much beyond the simple examples in the book. Most of the book recapitulates the JavaDocs that are available online. While you can certainly get started in SWT and JFace with this book, I prefer two other titles for that purpose:Professional Java Native Interfaces with SWT/JFace (Programmer to Programmer)andSWT/JFace in Action: GUI Design with Eclipse 3.0 (In Action series).Whichever book you choose to start with, you will need more. I am not aware of any good resources beyond the beginner level. I had to learn by experiment how to fit the event model into an architecture, how to use it with large sets of graphical elements, and how to communicate data among the parts of a program when you get bigger than the tiny tutorials in the book."
1,It is wasting money to buy -,"The book is full of mistakes and outdated old eclipse version, which it uses. I bought it and I regretted by the fact written by the English Major person not at least computer science major at minimum.I regretted I bought it."
5,Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!,"I have three children, ages 4 mo., 2, and 4. My oldest was a fan of ""Singing Babies Nursery Rhyme Time,"" so we rushed out to get ""Toddler Tunes."" Not only did my oldest still enjoy the babies singing, but my 4 mo. old was entranced from start to finish. No video in our house does that. We've already watched this tape twenty times at least. The babies appear in lush costumes and inhabit a make-believe world rich in color and striking images. They crawl around as they sing. My oldest really believes the babies can sing. For him, it's real. The ""Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes"" song got my 2 and 4 year olds on their feet, touching the body parts along with a life-size teddy bear. Real cute! This video hits a daily home run in our house."
1,Creepy.,"I find this video disturbing. There's something unsettling about seeing older human mouths and voices superimposed upon infants that you know can't yet walk or talk. I guess kids may enjoy it, but I'm uncomfortable watching it when I'm alone in the house. It's just too strange."
1,"Seller was great, product not so much.","I do like other Springfield products, but this thing is all over road. Think it is seriously affected by the glass window."
5,Works well and easy to see.,"This one, at the price, will do the job nicely. It is easy to read from a distance, clings well, and will most probably be a good purchase for you. I like it and am happy I have it. It runs about 6"" x 5"" or so. A solid product! A+"
1,Off 20 degrees,"I bought this item for our sliding door, and it hasn't worked right since we got it. It's always off about 20 degrees. We tried to calibrate it like it says, but it just doesn't work.I bought a different one, and it works fine. Dont waste your money."
1,"Jams frequently, fell apart, now in trash","I had three cheap Swingline staplers in my office that were driving me crazy because they jammed if you tried to staple more than two pieces of paper together. I decided to spend a little extra for a ""good"" stapler and got this one. It has been a major disappointment. It jams frequently, so you have to open it up and perform staple extraction surgery. Today, when I did the normal procedure, its innards fell out. I put it back together, but it just was not the same. I tried to make it better, but the springs went kablooey. I decided to drop it in the trash rather than waste 30 more minutes of my life on this sad product. Now I'm shopping for a truly good stapler on Amazon."
3,Awkward to use,"This steamer got hot fast and makes a lot of steam, but it's big, somewhat heavy and a little awkward to use. But, for getting out a few wrinkles it's great."
2,It leaks!,"I've had a lot of problems using this, my sister has one and loves it! but for me, it leaks."
2,Do you have a Microscope?!?!?!?,"That's what you'll need to read this book...the size was 2.5"" square...I was expecting the 6"" X 6"" size which is what my neighbor had loaned me. I guess I didn't pay attention to ""MiniCube"" title in the order and just saw ""CubeBook"" and ordered. My bad in over-looking the ""Mini"" in the description but people, SURELY you should include dimensions for your customers...won't order books without dimensions again!!! :((("
5,Good equipment.,"This combo was great to help me learn blood pressures for my CNA and ECG classes. The stethoscope and cuff were exactly the same as used in my CNA class, which made me very happy because they're so easy to use. Stethoscope has many pieces to change out if you may be listening to heart murmurs, etc, but it is very good and I could hear the systolic and diastolic BP's every time when using it. Overall, good kit, for not much money!"
5,Works for me!,I really love it its easy to use and i've had hundreds to tell me how much they like it and how cute it is. Expecially bigger kids...
4,Great speaker for the money,"A great center channel speaker for the money...delivers clear, crisp sound. Would recommend for anyone's Home Theater system."
5,Very Crisp For Dialogue,I auditioned a bunch of center channel speakers at a large store. This one had the clearest tweeter and was the best speaker for understanding dialogue. It isn't too tinny either. A great choice. I got rid of my old center channel speaker and now I can hear dialogue much better in my home theatre.
5,this guitar rock!,this electric guitar made my dreams come true! it's good for beginner's and long time guitar players!!! to all guitar players just believe in yourself!
5,Birthday gift,"It's exactly what it claims to be, and my Dad loves it, because he loves Taz. :) So, definitely well received, and no problems with the product so far."
5,Great read,This is a good book and an easy read. It's always better to get things from the view point of someone that has lived it. I would much rather learn about Autism from someone that has experienced it than someone who thinks they know everything.
5,"Fabulous, enlightening reading!","Through reading this book I was able to understand my 23 yr old daughter and why she has always been so, unfortunately, difficult due to our ignorance. We now have a calmer, closer relationship and are working on strategies together to enable her life to be more ordered and accessible to her. Brilliant book!!"
5,A Handbook to Carry,"This is a handbook to carry everywhere, refer to often. But it is most beneficial if its words are taken to heart and mind and put into practice. If done so with depth, freshness and sincerity, transformation seems inevitable."
5,"""Beatriz is great""","I love this two CD album! She really knows how to put on a show with her technic and emotion in her songs. I love all the songs and I can't help but envy her. I sing with a professional mariachi group and when I sing one of her songs, it's like I can hear her singing in the back ground and I am feeling her emotion when I am singing. If there is anymore of her CD's out that I don't know about, please let me know, anyone.connie"
4,Alternative to Fodor's,"Good book for those wanting an alternative to the more mundane travel guides. I used it for a trip to Lebanon and was much better prepared than I would have been without it. Good pictures, maps and information, well presented!"
3,Cute book but needs more substance.,I bought this book expecting more fashion tips. There are several useless facts about how Kate finds style in everyday objects. The book was interesting even though it wasn't what I expected. If you really want a book about fashion and only fashion I would heed the words of other reviews. If you decide to get the book I recommend waiting for the paperback or buying a used version.
4,how could you not love this ?,"Kate Spade is an extroidinary woman who has come so far and is stepping over the boundaries of fashion designers into a world that another review feels "" is to emily post"" i think it is awfully crazy to assume that Ms.Spade would ever copy off of someone as dignified as Emily Post. I say Bravo to Kate Spades new book !"
5,"This book has it all! Romance, witches, wizards, manly hunks, paranormal magic!","I can't understand the low reviews for this book! I absolutely loved it! Romance, witches, wizards, manly hunks, paranormal magic... interweaved to make me hate to put the book down. I've already ordered the follow-up book: The Destined Queen. I can hardly wait for it to arrive!"
5,"Wow, baby. Lookout for Figdital!","This album is an infectious groove-laden orgy for your ears. Sometimes tongue-in-cheek, sometimes intense, Condo Life is never boring. It will keep your Condo rockin' till the wee hours of the morning. With its slick syncopation, fat basslines and melodic gorgeousness you're sure to get a groove on with this tuneage."
3,nightfather,"This book was a different. I had never read a Holicost book like this. It was confusing, it jumpt from one topick to a nather. I don't thank I would read this book a gain."
2,Universal Fit Implied; Not,"These seat covers appear to have decent material for the modest price. Hence the two stars. But wouldn't you think ""universal design"" implies ""universal fit""? No go, Joe, on my 1993 Volvo 240, one of the most common seat designs around. Will see how Amazon values customer satisfaction in the return process."
2,Older is better,"This newer model Tupperware Spaghetti Container is not nearly as good as the older model which had a lid that turned to give closed, one portion, or two portion positions. The measuring insert of the new model will not stay in place. Unfortunately, the older but better model is no longer available. Probably due to outsourcing of quality in favor of profits."
2,Pasta tupperware,The plastic insert to measure how much pasta to dispense keeps popping out - everytime we open the outside cap it pops out - very frustrating. Absolutely perfect concept - they need to refine it to work proper.
5,love it,Just happened to see this on amazon and thought I would give it a try. works as expected. of course tupperware has been around for years so I'm very familiar with their products. very useful and would recommend.
3,Not what I expected.....,"I bought this book thinking it was another book. I was going to return it, but it does serve its purpose at the moment. I wish the photographs were larger. I thought a bit pricey for what it was and the cd rom is not Mac compatable, so I have no use for it!"
5,Rich Reading,The stories in this volume are so original and intriguing.George MacDonald writes multi-layered tales that make great read aloud stories for children and fascinating studies for adults.
4,An evening With Dave Grusin Is Not A Long Evening,"I've been listening to Dave Grusin since the 1980's when he and Larry Rosen formed GRP Records.They team up again on An Evening With Dave Grusin. The DVD includes some of Dave's Classic Movie Themes like On Golden Pond, It Might Be You with a vocal performence by Patti Austin and Moon River song by Monica Macini the daughter of the late Henry Mancini. Backed by the 75 piece Henry Mancini insitute Orchestra They sound great. Dave Grusin's Piano Skills are still in Top Form. On the downside there are to many Voice overs during the songs,and I would had liked to hear Dave perform more of his classic songs like St.Elsewere from the Medical Show of the 80's and Mountain Dance from the Meg Ryan Film Falling In Love."
5,Very pleased,"I'm so pleased with this CD. I'm throwing myself a birthday party (56 yrs old, born in '56) inviting a bunch of gals from the same era. We'll be eating, drinking, dressing as one would at a party in '56, (then bowling!) and I took a chance that this CD, of the many I considered, would be a perfect background for the party. I just listened to a few cuts on my Bose system. The sound quality is wonderful. You just can't help but dance with the tunes, they sound so great. Of course, these were all hits before I was old enough to appreciate them, but I've heard them over the years. It's great to own this collection. I have a feeling I'll be listening to this CD long after the party is forgotten. What fun!"
5,Quinoa Not Like Anything Else,"I got started on Quinoa when ""health food"" set off my food allergies and I was desperate to find non gluten and not rice or soy milk foods without the high fat concentrations of vegetable fat.Quinoa was my God send to settle my system down. It has a flavor not quite like anything else. It is part crunch and part a rubbery texture.For serving it I like it best with cream and sugar. I have noticed though I almost get hungrier eating it and sometimes a drier mouth later in the day. Why I have no idea, but different foods to affect the body differently.While it lacks the ""nutty"" of a whole millet which is good too, it makes a nice alternative to the far too limited diets we have now.I have tried the Quinoa flakes too which is like oatmeal, but without that horrid strong taste of oatmeal that I personally do not like."
5,Great price and product,"I recently have been eating Quinoa because of the health benefits, and my local stores only carry very small flavored packages. I searched on Amazon and found this Bob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa and it comes in a box of 4! I loved being able to stock up this way. The product is high quality."
5,"Fantastic, fresh and easy to prepare!","Who says healthy has to be blah or bad tasting?!?! This organic grain is so easy to prepare and goes with everything - you forget it's healthy and good for you! Great savings over local grocery stores. Love the service as well - before you know it, it is delivered to your door."
5,quinoa (keen-wa) grain from Bob's Red Mill,"Quinoa has a unique flavor, kind of nutty, and needs little doctoring to taste good, in my opinion. High in fiber and protein. I enjoy this as an excellent alternative to rice and potatoes. Had to give up most pasta and bread products. Good value also. One box makes a lot."
4,"Meh. Not bad, not the best.","I love Bob's stuff. The quinoa, while a generally good deal, had just a SLIGHT bitter taste as compared to the other pre-washed Quinoa that I've used (large bag of Organic from Costco actually). It's good of course, and good for you, just that I'll switch back to Costco's stuff from now on."
2,Toxicity,"There are two sources of Okinawan Coral. Coral which is mined above sea level and MarineCoral (below-sea) which is vacuumed from the ocean bottom near the Coral reefs. Which isbest, Above-Sea or Below-Sea sourced coral?Laboratory analysis of the two kinds shows each variety has 74 minerals and have similarquantities of the minerals. Above-Sea Coral tends to have a little higher percentage of Calcium- 35 to 38% while the Marine variety has 20 - 24% calcium.So when you read about a company having 500 mg of Coral calcium per capsule, you knowthat roughly 1/3 of that is pure calcium - most of the better companies will point out the exactpercentage. All of it comes from Okinawan Coral and toxic levels of heavy metals is anon-issue for all above-sea and almost all below-sea coral."
1,Still a quack,"Barefoot's assertions about calcium are simply unproven and misleading. Previous reviews try to make a case by relying on individual anecdotal experiences. That's simply not enough. There's a wide array of research that does not support Barefoot's claims. It is entirely up to you to try this product, but before you do, at least do some research and/or consult your physician. There's plenty of people out there trying to make money while all these supplements continue to be unregulated. So be careful, not just with this, but with any supplement that seems to make unsubtantiated claims."
3,It's no Alarm but it's ok.,Where's all the backing vocals? What ever happend to the Mike Peters melody? I guess I was expecting a little more from the man who changed my out look on life when I was a teenager. If I haven't heard of Mike Peters or the alarm I would think this album is pretty good but I know what Mike is capable of putting out and this record is not one of his best efforts.
4,Really Gifted StoryTeller,Don't be fooled by Ferranti's storytelling skills. He shares with us gripping stories of behind the Prison Walls. Not only about inmates but the caretakers as well. Curious about what goes on behind the big steel gates? Then pick this one up. It is a must read.
4,Good Reunion Show But I Would Like For The Carol Burnet Show To Be On DVD In Complete Seasons!,The Carol Burnett show is a very hilarious show and I even liked this reunion show but what I would really love to see is for The Carol Burnett Show to pe out on DVD in complete seasons. Yes I know that they have reruns of the show all the time on TV but they shorten it to 30 minutes and you miss out on some great skits so I think it would be great to have complete seasons on DVD!
3,Excellent technical information,"This book provides excellent information on the technical details of bear making. How to achieve ""the look ""of teddy bear artists. I found the patterns, included in the book, a little disappointing, but other readers may enjoy making pumpkin shaped bears! and other oddities!"
4,Working great,"This product is working great for me. So far I have copied entire c disk on it, and I could access it on other machines as and when required without any issues.Manoj"
4,Need better software for backups,"If you buy a fine extern hard drive disk for backups, and this is the most frequent way to use a extern hard disk, you expect the hardware were accompanied with friendly software. Well this is not the case of the Fire Lite 2.0 USBFLB40. The version of ""BounceBack Express"" software is a cheep one that is very difficult to use."
3,Viking 512 flash drive,Functions fine. Top comes off and was lost within a month. A little bulky compared to peer 512 flash drives.
5,Rich --and Entertaining--Local History Indeed!,"I only started reading this book, but I can tell I am going to enjoy it immensely. Even LaFarge's introduction is very interesting and informative. Granted its very dense reading, rich in detail---I think it is best read as a ""bedside"" volume, in small doses. Fortunately, many of the essays are quite short. A must for anyone, like me, who is a recent transplant and interested in the rich history and culture of Santa Fe. You really get to know the people who helped to shape this town over the years."
4,Tony Orlando,"I certainly agree that this is NOT their best concert footage. In order to fully appreciate Rooney for the exceptional group they are, buy the album and see them live. As someone who has the album and has seen them live several times, I attest it is certainly worth your money. This DVD, however valuable its music videos and off-beat interviews are, fell short of my expectations. It was nice to see the brief appearance of Allison from the Donnas. And the fact that guitarist Taylor Locke looks like a very skinny Tony Orlando makes it a FOUR STAR purchase."
1,Late shipment,"Did not receive package until 12/28/2006,should have been here before 12/18/2006. I think I should be rebated for my shipping charge."
2,Its an okay guitar,"So to all you Amazon buyers. This is an okay guitar... I got it their was parts that were chipped off, other parts were just plain un painted and it came un tuned. They picture shows a strap a case and three picks. I got everything except for the picks i got 1 out of three. Im keeping it only because im a beginner so i don't really need a professional guitar. I recommend it if you just want to like play one song and just store it or something. Or like a a starter guitar. You want to learn but don't have enough money to actually buy a good brand guitar.... Save your money if you really want a good guitar you'll be disappointed with this product... You get what you paid for i guess. I bought it for $64 bucks not bad for a average guitar. Good luck to you whos looking for a guitar and i hope this helps you narrow your searches."
4,great shipping!!,"i got my guitar about 2 short days after i ordered it, and i love it, i spent everyday playing it!! its great for beginners, as far as learning the chords, but if you want something that sounds nice when your playing it right, then you might want to invest elsewhere, the chords dont sound right even when the guitar is prefectly in tune, but there are ways around this, as i've discovered, it just takes some time to pick up is all."
4,Great Beginner Guitar!,This is a great starter guitar. One of the strings popped off when I was tuning it but they had sent extra strings with it so I was ok. It had a few paint chips/smudges on the soundhole design but I don't mind since it was so affordable! I love the black! And it came with everything it said it would except they gave me the wrong type of strap that has 2 holes and this guitar only has one peg(one hole on the strap) for the strap and then you put the other end of the strap on the top of neck. But it wasn't a big deal.
1,Spend money elsewhere.,"The guitar is a waste of money. It's old and warp, strings are old and worn too. Too bad my niece cannot enjoy her Christmas present. Very disappointed."
5,Wow!,It is hard to believe that I could get this quality of an instrument for this price! I look forward to many years of enjoyment.
1,No such thing as quality...definitely no bang for the bucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I would no recommend this product to anyone. I was ordered as a Christmas gift for my daughter (16yrs old). She advised me 4 days ago that the neck is cracked all the way; part that contacts to the base of the guitar. She is very disappointed, as she is unable to use the product for fear it will fall apart. She has had to replace all of the strings, one popped then one by one the others followed."
5,Very good deal,"This was my first personal guitar (though I have been playing for 1-2 years now)... and I never expected a $60 guitar to be this good.. for beginners, this is a perfect deal."
4,Good,"I read all the reviews before purchasing, and I just received this in the mail for my friend. It was packaged nicely and the tuner pipe is quite handy! He has already begun learning some simple songs and we are both verrry happy with this guitar!"
3,mediocre,1) it came stringed and the strings were WAY too tight and two snapped when I was tuning it. 2) the circle design wasn't there like pictured...it wasn't there at all. 3) the neck is crooked. Luckily its not my first rodeo here and I could fix everything. The sound is wonderful when I play.
3,Missing parts,"No strings came with the item, it had a rainbow colored strap, kinda strange for a boy. I called them and they fixed the string problem by sending so,e, which broke in a week, the strap was nothing they could do. This now sits in the back of his closet, oh boy super toy."
1,Horrible quality!!!,"I bought a Barcelona guitar from Austin Bazaar, when we opened the guitar (a birthday present) we realized that there were several problems with the built and quality of it. The headstock is cracked, the frets are too long (you can get hurt if you pass your hand by the neck of the gutar), the neck is not glued properly, the stickers on the pick guard and sound hole are about to fall off and the third fret is so bad that you cannot get the right sounds of it.I tried to contact the seller by phone for over two days and kept getting to voice mails. I wrote and email to them explaining my frustration and they asked me to sent back the guitar (I had to pay for the shipping)but the kindly offered to send me a much more expensive guitar if I pay for the price diference, as if I would risk to get another bad musical instrument from them.Defenitly one of the worst products and worst service ever."
3,my first guitar,"I bought this guitar as a beginner who has started to learn it. I like it very much and the sound quality is very good. However, the body is very big and woudnt recommend it for beginners or anybody with small hands"
1,Terrible Condition,"The guitar came scratches all over the guitar, broken, and items were missing I was really disappointed. I wasn't expecting much because of the price but the condition was just not even worth the price. I honestly wouldn't recommend for anyone to buy this product. I do not know much about guitars but I know enough to know that this is a terrible product"
1,"Should have been titled ""Travels with Calvin""","After hearing Mr. Trillin speak on a public radio talk show, I thought I'd love to read one of his books, as I found him so amusing. As it turns out, I found this book very boring. I've traveled in many of the countries he mentioned but found his descriptions of food and place uninteresting and found myself skipping over many parts trying to get to something interesting. Little mention was made of Alice. His two daughters played a bigger part in the rendition and it was mostly about Calvin. I don't know if I'd care to try another of his books."
2,Not for laptop HDs,"I bought the one for laptop harddrives and it broke very quickly. I don't know about the full size harddrive one, but I know that the laptop one was very poorly made. I personally would look elsewhere."
3,Anti-Wahabbi,"Encyclopedia of Islamic Doctrine; by Shaykh Muhammad Hisham Kabbani; As-Summan Foundation of America; 8 different paperbacks; 1998.Vol. 1: Beliefs [Islamic](Aqida): Topics: the Ashari school, Salafis movement, how Salafis malign Asharis, Hanbali school, khawarij, Ibn Taymiyya, anthropomorphism, the aberrations of the Wahhabis and Salafis.Vol. 2: Remembrance of Allah and praising the Prophet (Dhikr Allah, Madih, Naat, Qasidat al-Burda)Vol. 3: The Prophet: Commemorations, Visitation and His knowledge of the Unseen (Mawlid, ziyara, Ilm al-Ghayb)Vol. 4: Intercession (Shafaa, tawassul, istighatha)Vol. 5: Self-purification: State of Excellence (Tazkiyat al-Nafs/Tasawwuf, ihsan)Vol. 6: Forgotten aspects of Islamic worship: Part One.Vol. 7: Forgotten aspects of Islamic worship: Part Two.Vol. 8: Indices."
2,Needs a rating system,"I was depending on this book to direct me to the best campgrounds in the area. However,without a rating system, the book is only half as good. I use the California version as a bible for camping and was disappointed to find this missing for Oregon/Washington."
5,Conair Infiniti,I previously owned a chi straightener. Loved it. When it broke I needed to replace it but didn't have enough money so I bought the Conair Infiniti that is much cheaper. I love it!!! It straightens faster and hair stays straighter longer. The temperature on the straightener gets to I think 455 degrees. But you don't have to put it that high if you don't want it that high. It also heats up fast. Love it.
3,"It's a good flat iron, at first","I've had this flat iron for about two years. When I first purchased it, it was wonderful. I used it alot on my hair and others. I have very coarse and thick hair so i usually require alot of heat. and this flat iron worked well. and then after about a year, it didn't get quite as hot. I notice my hair is dull after use and not shinning like it was in the beginning. The cord has a short in it now, and it just cuts off without warning. So after I tired of constantly fumbling with the cord and got use to the fact that it doesn't get as hot as it use to, I have retired this flat iron. I now own another brand and don't even use the infiniti anymore. For first time users this is probably a good tool. its easy to use and doesn't burn or scorch the hair. and it's reasonably priced. I can only give it three stars though, because i expected it to last longer than 2yrs."
1,it sucks...,"I have straight wavy hair and I try it after I blow dry my hair , and while I was doing a section it was puffing the others section that I already had finished. at thy end I ended with the home iron. and gave to it my daughter, which by the way it didn't work for her neither ."
3,Hair craze!,I ordered this item and was very excited to try it. It is okay. I don't love it. It heats up very quickly and comes with a protective bag...which is great! However I thought that the plates would be larger. They are not very wide.
5,"If you love showtunes, this is the book for you!","OK, so your friends roll their eyes when you break out into a tap dance, feigning your best Jimmy Cagney impression to the tune of Yankee Doodle Dandy. But if George M. Cohen and Whistling Dixie are right up your alley, then you are in some rare luck with this hard-to-find gem. This book features the sheet music from all the famous American composers and Broadway musicals. I have been playing the music from this book since the age of 10 or so, so 17 years and two copies later, I'm eager to return to the classics. They're all here: Bicycle Built for Two, Man on the Flying Trapeze, Buffalo Gals, Bird in a Guilded Cage, Shenandoah, On the Sidewalks of New York, and my Scottish grandfather's favourite, In the Gloaming. So take it from a showtune fanatic--this book is a great collector's item!"
2,Short lived...,This worked at chasing moles away. But the blade broke off in a few weeks. My husband had to glue the blades back on several times. Needs to be built to last. We live in the Midwest & don't have extreme winds.
5,Great Product,Easy to assemble. Works like a charm ! This mole chaser has lived up to its expectations and I haven't seen a mole since installing it.
3,Not for sure if it worked,"Only thing that I can say is it needs a rounded point on the end that goes in the ground. but I ended up catching two of the varmits with a grubbing hoe .But no more have showed up near the yrd now they are down in the pasture . So I am not sure if the thing works or not, but will let you know as I am planning on moving it to the pasture area that the moles are tearing up right now."
1,Two fell apart,"My dad had two of these. No idea if they had any effect on the gophers in his yard. However, the first one lasted only a fraction of a year, and the second one couldn't keep its blade on even when it was new: didn't hold together even in moderate winds."
3,"""Peter & Paul"" is Great, but much was cut out for this tape.","I think this film adaptation was done very well, but... When Peter and Paul was first aired on TV it was a Small miniseries (2 or 3 days...2 hours each day??? Not sure). I was suprised to find it reduced to just 94 minutes. It would have been better to package it as a two or three tape set. Then, too, the price would justify itself. You'll still enjoy this tape, but any amount of editing for length was too much. There wasn't a minute of this series to be missed."
1,poor work,"No very good acting, surprisingly.The movie does not follow the bible very well. It gives you a wrong impression of the caracters."
3,Riviting but Dangerously Skewed,"Without a doubt, the performances were outstanding, that is if you believe that Peter was a wimp and Paul was continuously caving in to temper tantrums. The devil is in the details, and the details according to the writer seems to be that he wants us to believe that it was Paul and not Peter that deserved the ""keys of the Kingdom."" He imposed a view of Peter and Paul that suggests through repitition that faith ALONE will save us.I have watched this film many times and with each viewing,a interior voice advised, ""Go read Acts."" I did, several times, and found the film's account of the famed duo not only lacking, but led one to error. Message: beware when performances diminish (cloud) accuracy, fact, and judgment. I have thus tossed my copy. These days, I seek unadulterated truth, particularly when it comes to scripture. I don't think it is asking too much to require both accuracy and outstanding performances when one addresses matters of faith and morals."
5,Sound Doctrine & Hopkins is Superb,"For the rest of THIS life, I will envision Anthony Hopkins when I think of Paul. That is why I love these types of movies - they help form a visual image when reading the Bible. Hopkins is absolutely awesome as usual, and the story never strays from biblical soundness. The title is a bit misleading as it's much more centered around Paul than Peter. I loved it, and look forward to watching it again and again."
1,Waste of money,This movie is biblically wrong and it sucks. I would recommend this DVD entitled Acts. It is word for word scriptures and accurately and well done.
1,Not Biblically accurate,"The movie portrays Paul as not very enthusiastic or loving as the bible shows him to be. Also I could not get over the anger between Paul and Peter...it was defenately over the top. Toward the end I was fed up with Pauls anger issues with Peter that I could not finish watching it because Anthony Hopkins,who played Paul,kept yelling at the top of his voice at Peter. It's just not the Paul of the Bible. I wish these producers would try to make their movies more Biblically accurate; This movie was not one of them. Don't waste you money on this one. Instead you should watch the DVD, St. John in exile, played by actor Dean Jones. I give Dean Jones 5 stars for his performance it was outstanding and I think you'll agree after viewing it."
5,excellent,I teach scripture and I like the way this film is presented. I often show this film when to my classes when I'm teaching on the journeys of St. Paul.It's fairly accurate and entertaining to watch.I would definitely recommend it.
1,"Awful quality,",I don't know where they got this but it was awful. Looked like they filmed it AT a theatre with a camcorder. Do Not buy!
1,AN ABOMINABLE VERSION OF A NEAR-CLASSIC,"I loved this film when it first came out, and am wondering why every copy available has been edited from the original 'R' rated version, and also why none of them are above total mediocrity in film quality. I bought this because I'll watch just about anything with Jenny Agutter in it, and the late Warren Oates has always been one of my favorite character actors. This is a great pic, and deserves much better treatment than this sorry transfer. Don't waste your money ( as I did ) on this tripe."
1,Another Widescreen Conversion Disaster!,"I will add a whole-hearted second to the previous three reviews and add that this is DVD is a prime example of how a widescreen or letterbox conversion can butcher a perfectly good 4x3 movie format. This DVD-R appears to have been copied from a standard format VHS tape by enlarging the frame to obtain a letterbox width and then chopping off the bottom and/or top of the frame to achieve the widescreen effect. The result is very noticeable, especially if you have seen the original movie or VHS tape.This is the second Reel Classic Films DVD I have been burned on. I will steer clear of this company in the future!"
4,Good Book,"Mike is instantly lovable and heartbreakingly realistic. Her inner dialogs are not only believable, I couldn't get them out of my head. It was so refreshing to read a book about a gay teen that didn't have to worry about being teased and abused by peers as Mike and Jamie are both accepted and loved in thier home town Coalton. (although, a little too convinient)There are many other things going on in this book besides Mike's love/angst for Xanadu. She is dealing with her morbidly obese mother who ignores her, her emotionally distant older brother, the lost family business, being the town softball champ, her father's suicide, and her friend Jamie's new cyber love. IMHO, the author tackles all of these issues well.There is an internal element in this book that is often missing in teen literature, adding depth and feeling that made the book stay with me.The down-to-earth ending resolves much for Mike, but leaves some of her relationships up in the air, astonishingly like real life."
2,cheaply built and no repair parts available,"This toy is great fun, but is so cheaply built, and poorly engineered that the wheels fall off with little provocation rendering it useless. The axle connector on the left side wheels are soft and crack with just a little normal play. My son was very dissapointed, as was I ($20 down the drain) and contacting the manufacturer proved fruitless."
1,"Cheaply made,only lasted 1 day!",My son got this as a gift for his 4th birthday and it was broken by the next day! He had lots of fun until the wheel broke off at the axel.I am going to try and return it today!
2,Blue Emu,Product was not helpful in pain relief. Perhaps the addition of lidocaine would have better. I would not recommend this product to friends.
3,May be helpful to others,Priced significantly less than in my local stores so I gave it a try but it just hasn't worked for my arthritic back
4,very good pain reliever,"Have been using product off,on for 10 yrs with good results.Not quite as good as penetrex,but is very good and better value."
3,"Music, Dancing and comedy sketchs with Carol.","This is not the infamous The Carol Burnett Show nor the shorter syndicated version of, but a Carol Burnett special she made for broadcast television in 1994. Her guest stars, Scott Bakula, Barry Bostwick and Michael Jeter (recently passed away with HIV/AIDS) who sing and dance and join Carol Burnett in several comedy sketches. The comedy sketches have do to with Broadway and classic motion pictures. Tony Bennett also guest stars and offers his fine Italian vocal talent. Tony and Carol do a duet.It is always nice to see a Carol Burnett special."
1,Absolutely Does Not Work,"I bought 4 of these to put around my yard. I have sand and dozens of moles. They are eating the roots off of my trees and killing them, etc. I have also noticed that they love the birdseed/sunflower seed I have down for the birds. I am continuously finding mole holes directly under my bird feeders so I put solar molers right under the feeders. They just come up right next to the solar molers. I think the sound/vibration keeps them about 2 inches away and that is all. Don't waste your money."
3,So-so album that gets annoying..try BOND or MAE instead,I caught the PBS special about 12 Girls Band and thought that it was worth a listen. I'm glad I bought one instead of the whole catalog right off the bat! I was concerned that the whiny/twangy instruments would overpower the upbeat rhythms and become very annoying and I was right. After two listens to this disc I think I will pack it away as a novelty. I would recommend Vanessa Mae and BOND as truly viable alternatives to quench the thirst for classical crossed with dance rhythms.
1,"Oh dear, here we go again","The wonder of modern marketing. The Chinese has a saying ""putting old wine in a new bottle"". Have 12 young nice looking women in tight fitting outfits playing exotic looking instruments. If you have seen the musicians from China Disabled People's Performing Art Troupe, you will agree those artists do a much better job. As for the music, I don't even want to go there. Lila Downs?! Mexico has produced wonderful opera singers. Does Ramon Vargas ring a bell? Ms. Downs CANNOT sing opera arias, so please live with your shortcomings and leave the opera arias to the real pros and our ears will be very thankful!"
1,not pleased with Amazon,"I have not received this book and it has been almost a month. My experience to say the least has not been good. You can not contact Amazon even though there is an e-mail address, they ask you not to reply. They have my money, but I have no book."
1,Steering Wheel Cover Disaster,"I got this rather fast, wrapped nicely, had it one day and the elastic broke and had to remove it. Very thin material, not impressed at all."
4,Ideas on how to express your Love,This is a good book! I would not used it as an instructional hand book. But' it is good to have on hand for referance; you know. When you have a question or you are not quite sure about something. It's that kind of book.
2,Whippets Today - for the expert only,"First a disclaimer: I haven't had a dog in over thirty years. So adopting a whippet was daunting. I wanted a book that told me how to take care of this new creature in my life - how much food and exercise she needs, the kinds of toys and games whippets tend to enjoy, etc. What I got instead was a book that described the various international standards by which whippets are judged in the show ring, and a great deal of detail on champions, their bloodlines, breeders and kennels. This is fine for those interested in breeding or showing, but wholly inadequate and superfluous to the besotted albeit novice whippet owner!"
4,A very good book for whippets lovers,"A very good book if you are interested in the race, shows, racing and blood lines. It describes in great detail the standards of the breed and the defects that may have dogs. It is not a book like ""care of his dog"""
5,Love It,"The two bag trolley is better than expected. I received it before Christmas which was awesome. I purchased this a gift for my mother and she absolutely love it.Thank you,Kim West"
4,So good...but so obscure.,"This very obscure 1987 release features some divine and exquisite Quiet Storm ballads that will please all romantic and smooth Soul fans. ""Stay and Let Me Love You"", ""No Conversation"", ""Lover's Confessions"" and ""Turn Out The Lights"" are understated but heartfelt tales of love and lust that will soothe your heart and soul. View From The Hill recorded just one album... but it was a near-masterpiece."
4,The Making of a Man Who Moved The World,"Engaging right from the start, the author does a wonderful job of keeping the reader laughing and thinking as he lays down the course of this incredible man's life. I particularly enjoyed the way the author leads us through the changes in Franklin's thinking and mind set, showing us both his flaws and his character and growth as a man. Franklin is the portrait of a nation coming to grips with itself, and the world. As much as Ben Franklin grew, developed and gained personal power over his life, so too did the nation. Truly history is the story of the interventions of great men at the right time and place to perform the task."
5,"Amazing book, amazing man!",If someone would have told me that I'd read a book about Ben Franklin and wouldn't be able to put it down I'd call them crazy. I did though. 'The First American' held me spellbound.
3,Did not fullfill my expectations,"Having read Franklin's autobigraphy and many of his other writings, I expected a more lively read. However, given that Franklin was in England prior to and during most of the Revolutionary period, the book does offer a perspective not found in most books on our founding fathers and for this reason the book is worth reading."
5,Well worth the time,"I am a working mom and have little time to read for pleasure. I devoured this biography! Any fan of American history should read this work since it gives new perspective on the lives of not only Benjamin Franklin, but other important historical figures from the late 18th century. The humor and humanity of Franklin is clearly presented yet his fallacies are not hidden. The author is not afraid to present Franklin's shortcomings along with his many gifts and lets the reader decide what to judge. This important biography is well worth adding to your bookshelf!"
5,The First American Book on Franklin worth reading,"I shall keep this short and sweet. This is a wonderful book, over 700 pages that bring Benjamin Franklin to life, and lead us to better understand the events and mood of the colonies and Britain in the 18th century. I am a voracious reader (two or three books per week) but paradoxically I have savored this book for several months several pages at a time hoping somehow that the book would never end. I am hooked on H.W. Brands' writing and style. I will be looking forward to getting his new book on the gold rush and any future books that I hope he writes on American history. This is a great book to buy for your friends."
2,"A life, but too long a book","Author Brands certainly knows his topic, through some 700 pages. The more I read this book, the more I felt drowning in information, and by the time I had read 300 pages, found I needed to lightly skip some sections, especially those about the French-Indian Wars. The depth of information in this book is impressive, but it would have been more impressive if the book were 1/3 or so shorter."
3,Difficult to Read,"I was curious about the founding fathers of today's trend setting nation and having read the reviews, I decided to choose H.W. Brands' biography of Benjamin Franklin... But I was dissappointed... Yes, more details and you have a more accurate account of your hero's life... But what about the reader?... It took me great amount of effort to keep reading the book because the life pictured in it deserved it all... But I can not say the same for the book itself... Too detailed, too long, too confusing..."
1,Receipt of A Book in Deplorable Condition,"I thought I ordered a new, hard-back,collector's edition, of a book -- or at least one in good condition, ""The First American"" (Benjamin Franklin). The book I received is a paperback in deplorable condition -- old, yellow pages, dirty,terrible odor, falling apart and marked in ink on pages. I could not be more disappointed and I have not been able to find out how to return it. This book is not even in condition to give it away!"
4,"A bit Byzantine, but effectively dread-filled and creepy.","The story could have benfited from tighter focus and fewer subplots--a couple of the characters seemed extraneous--and some developments felt really contrived, but overall, this is a highly effective representation of the sub-sub genre, ""home invasion horror."" Rebecca De Mornay reminds us that she is very talented at playing a certain type of intense character. My expectations were contained going in, and they were substantially exceeded. I give Anchor Bay credit for releasing some of the better horror I've seen in the past few years. One thing: I realize this is a remake so probably no one had much choice in what to call the film, but ""Mother's Day"" is a pretty stupid title for it. Unless you're Norma Bates, do NOT get this as a Mother's Day gift!"
3,Oak Magazine Cabinet--family room,"I bought the magazine table on line basically because I could not find one I liked in retail stores. Once assembled the quality is good and the unit has several nice features like a pull-out drink holder and doors on the back and front that are somewhat disguised.Everything fit well and it is a fairly sturdy unit.From the description I knew it was one of those ""some assembly required"" deals but I was not expecting the task at hand. I was somewhat surprised when the box came and it was only about 3 inches deep. Truly, the parts were well fitted and the hardware was good quality but the instructions were terrible. The instruction set I had was ripped in the box (box was not) and that made it worse. Some of the hardware is not intuitive and you have to glue some of it (glue provided). To get it right took 1 1/2 hours from start to finish. All in all I am happy with the end result but if you are not handy--don't buy it"
2,Not very good,Arrived way later than the actual date. Product was printed hp printer paper. Very bad quality.
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed. I have been a Kris Kristofferson fan for many years. You could always identify him immediately on the radio. This CD does not sound like the Kris Kristofferson I love to hear. It isn't only that some of the songs are from his younger years. He had his own distinctive sound even then. This CD does not sound like him.
5,Love it!,Kris Christopherson is an amazing artist. I have followed his career since he started. Love his music and will be buying more of his CD's.
5,Great game for the playstation 2.,Son really enjoys the lego games and this is a unique one. The game has enough levels to last quite some time.
3,The Duchess of Devonshire's Chatsworth Cookery Book,"I was hoping for a specific recipe for amazing ginger scones once purchased from the Chatsworth Orangery when I ordered the cookery book. The recipe was not included in this book. The recipes which are included sound terribly old fashioned and not too appealing. I am reading another one of her books, ""Wait for Me"", which is very interesting."
4,Learn To Fly With Hilary Duff!,"This is Hil's third music DVD, and it's really great! Yes, as most of the people here are saying, it was a little short. But still, short or long, Hil's DVDs always turn out awesome. This DVD is mostly about the video Fly and the Most Wanted tour. Join Hilary in this DVD when she takes you behind the scenes in how the video of Fly was really made. Hil takes you to some shows and rehersals for you to watch. She talks about what it's like to be on tour, how it is to make a music video, about her own albums, and much more. In this DVD, Hilary puts on a concert rehersal for some contest winners. She takes you inside the tour bus and introduces you to her band. Plus, the video of Fly is on the DVD too! This DVD was worth it. Any Hilary Duff fan should own this DVD!"
4,Very good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ok this movie was a bit too short but it is worth the price even though it didn't have alot of bonus features i liked the ""Fly"" music video at the end of the movie. Hilary takes you behind the scenes of making the concert ""Most Wanted"" and the ""Fly"" music video. You get to see her tour bus her wordrobe for her concerts and you get to meet the band. Overall this is a good DVD."
3,Awkward & Inconsistent,"I bought this book for myself several years ago because I thought it was really cute. The paintings/illustration are nice, but the author tries way too hard to make this rhyming story sound smart and well-written when it really isn't. The author sounds like she's rambling and prattling on just to hear herself speak. It just doesn't work because the half her story doesn't match the book. Other than the cute pictures, the book really isn't a children's book. Some of the words are too advanced, though it does attempt to have a nice moral, even if a bit pretentious in its wannabe philosophical way. My husband thought it was weird and awkward too.Also, the pop-ups in the book are inconsistent. Didn't like that. It's a 34-page book (so let's say 17 sections) and there's a big chunk in the middle where there aren't any pop-ups at all. It's 9 out of 17 sections that have no pop-ups; that's over 50% of the book. I'm giving this book 2.5 stars at best."
3,Exercise Ball for my Father,"Great sturdy material--way to expensive for what it is (a plain old exercise ball), but I wanted my dad top have something nice. Perfect gift for my dad who is 6'2'' 200 lbs. Be careful not to throw away the plug for the ball--we had to retrive them from the box in the trash because they were not tapped to the ball or visible in the packaging."
4,cuts to the chase,"I purchased the book last year, and found it to be extremely valuable - online now because I am ordering a copy for my attorney!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought a French Roast variety, and did not like it taste at all. It is unpleasantly sour, with smell which reminds of a wet rug left in a dump place for few days. The vendor claims that one pod is good for an 8oz cup. It sounded suspicious, because the pod doesn't contain that much coffee. It fits in a ""one cup"" tray of Senseo. I tried to brew two 4oz cups, and the first one had a normal strength, but the second one was very weak. Overall I am very disappointed with this product. It costs more than Douwe Edberts brand, but tastes worse. The second star I gave it goes to packaging- it is very convenient, with each pod packed in a separate sealed envelope."
4,Good introduction.,"Straightforward, practical legal and business advice from a Hollyoodentertainment lawyer. Major focuses are copyright law and contracts for services.Includes advice on writing careersfrom established TV and movie writers."
3,somewhat disapointed,"The first two movies were worth watching, that's pretty much it, I was hoping to see all 4 movies with William Powell. It was worth the price I pd."
3,Worth the price,"The emphasis on William Powell leads you to believe that they are all Powell movies. There is only one, Kennel Club. The others are good flicks and worth the few bucks but they are also available on other collections."
5,You Can't Go Wrong w/ Wm. Powell,"Being a true fan of the early movies, you just can't go wrong with any movie that includes William Powell. I feel he's very underrated by most critics and have to say they can't be more wrong. His sense of timing and excellent humor bring out the best in any script. If you've not seen a movie with Mr. Powell, grab some popcorn, turn down the lights and get ready to enjoy."
3,Beware annoying watermarks !!!,"The movies themselves are neat, but they are average Platinum mediocre fare, varying in degree of quality of picture and sound. Still overlook-able in my book, but what annoys me most is the pop-up watermarks in the corner. Ugh"
5,Mystery Package purchased on Amazon .com,"I have not yet watched any of these movies, but I have reviewed the synopsis of each movie and I am anxious to see them. The casts are excellent and the story lines are very intriguing. The cost of the package was very reasonable."
3,Good for people who won't read the book,"This CD makes a good gift for people who would appreciate the advice offered by these therapists, but who would not take the time to read their book on disciplining teens. The style is rather repetitive and very chatty; I found this a little annoying, but many people would find this style friendly and accessible."
4,Not good in Mac,"Good over all quality.But the driver sucks in Leopard and therefore the 10 side keys don't work. Waited for a year, but no driver update come out yet.But after all, I like its key feeling, better than most other keyboards."
1,Surreal,"I don't know what to think of those people who give this book high ratings. Clearly, there are deluded folks out there.PS. This book doesn't deserve a rating, but Amazon makes it necessary so I have given it the one star."
3,perhaps with tea....,"yes, unfortunately it is a task to clean up, the nonstick surface isn't so effective, and contrary to the tall and fluffy waffle image shown, the waffles come out thin, thin, thin. and as an earlier review says, they also come out a little on the done side; done and thin make for great tea cookies not waffles."
2,Not so happy,"It was all it was described to be, with a few exception. The waffles were not like the waffles from our perevious maker. The batter ran out the front and sides. What a mess. The waffles also stuck when trying to remove them. We returned it to the seller and obtained one like our old one."
1,Terrible product,"First, this waffle iron gets way too hot. I have never owned any other appliance that got this hot on the outside. This is not safe.Second, it does not make good waffles. The heat is not uniform. The beep to indicate when the waffles are ready is way too early.Third, pieces have started to break including the knob to set the temperature. You can still turn the metal piece that sticks out but this gets even hotter than the outside."
2,the only redeeming quality is that it makes several,"So, after seeing the stock photos of golden, beautiful waffles, and dreaming of actually being able to make waffles fast enough to feed my four kids at the same time, I purchased this.Wow.... Uber disappointment....First, we all know, SIZE MATTERS! Six waffles in this waffle maker equal 2 regular waffles. Ok, disappointing, but better than my old one, and 4""x4"" waffles are kinda cute, so, a we fired it up. Second disappointment- beautiful golden brown bottoms, patchy on the top. Turning up the browning control only leads to burned patches. .Also, as pointed out in another review, the heat element is circular, so the corner of the waffles are not done as well as the center.Overall.... Probably returning this, and getting a decent regular size single waffle maker."
2,"If you decide not to ever use it, it must be a failure",Got ours out this fine holiday morning to make waffles. The plates are so sticky that there's no way a waffle will come out. Cleaning nearly impossible and cannot take the plates out to give them a good wet scrub. Whoever designed this made sure it could be used exactly ONCE. Waaay too expensive for that.
3,Not Belgian,"We'd ordered this as a larger replacement for our much-loved Cuisinart WMB-2 waffle maker, which just died after 5 years of weekly service.Sadly, we didn't read carefully enough. This makes waffles with small indents, not Belgian waffles. The individual waffles are also quite a bit smaller, rectangular instead of square, and use quite a bit less batter per waffle. So back it went, and we got the Cuisinart WAF-4B model instead, which only makes four waffles at a time but we like the waffle dimensions better.Also, I can see why people complain about the size of the handle -- the heat-protected part really is narrow and would not be a full-hand operation (I wear women's size small gloves)."
1,Buyer beware,"I mixed up my favorite waffle recipe in anxious anticipation of delicious waffles. No matter how little or how much batter I placed in it, it mostly went to the middle portion and ran out the front and the back. What a mess. We could not get it to work right. We were terribly disappointed."
1,Worst Kitchen Co Ever,Cuisinart Hase the worst customerservice dept ever refused to honor warrenty acuseed me of useing product comercialy and would only fix if I paid a fee almost equal to a new machine. Don't take a chance with Cuisinart
1,I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA,"After almost a year and a half, this camera has simply quit working correctly. When I turned it on, it either wouldn't focus at all, making the pictures extremely blurry, or wouldn't let me take pictures. At first, it would only do that sometimes, but it continually got worse, and now it won't work at all. Even while this camera did work, it was very slow at taking pictures, and even after the picture was taken, it took at least 15 seconds to take another picture. It is very bulky, and hard to carry around with you. All in all, i do not recommend this camera for anyone."
3,Fair camera for low price.,"The price is the best part about this camera. I played with it for about two weeks and did not have a good deal of luck. Pictures outside in bright light were good. But any pictures indoors with light and flash were not as good as my other digital camera. Lot of blurry pictures. Flash would completely blackout the rest of the picture. LCD display not very crisp to check for blurriness of snapped pictures. Easy to use, just very slow in saving pictures, erasing pictures and shutter speed. I don't know how good a deal it is when the pictures don't come out well."
5,Great Camera.,"Ive been on the search for a decent DigCamera, and this has reached my expectations in every level. I see some complaints about the LCD getting grainy. #1. Yes its not that great of an LCD, but what would you want a better LCD than picture quality? I think not, its all about the Picture Quality, this thing can hit up to a 2048xWhatever, And still its better than a 35MM picture, All In All I took pictures in pitch black from about 30 ft away, and my pictures turned out better than you think. Get this camera while you can. And yes ive taken over 200+ pics with the standard batteries, that came with the camera, and yes the LCD was on. No battery's dead yet."
3,Edgar Allan Poe,I got this e-book to read on my tablet but I expected Poe's stories and that wasn't quite what this was. I did not finish this so I am unable to rate it fairly.
2,Just not my thing,"I love Poe's poetry, but I just don't think his shorts are my thing. There is too much tedious dialogue and detail that, to me, bogs down the stories. I really wanted to love it. Just couldn't do it though."
5,Creepy!,"So... Edgar! If you like horror, or just creepy poems, YOU WILL LOVE IT!!! I did. It was excellent!! YAY!"
4,Great poems!,I've always loved the story of this book. This classic really draws me into it and keeps me interested in continuing to read it!
4,husband review,My husband asked me to get this set of Poe for him. He seemed to enjoy it. He is not normally a reader. I was surprised that he read it.
5,Gujarati text is is Econometrics understable.,"As a Professor of Econometrics (Faculty of Insurance, UAP University at Madrid. Spain) Demodar N. Gujarati makes completely accesible the science of Econometrics to students of the nucleus of this difficult matter."
5,Excellent reference book,"Good for both students and graduates, this book offers clear description of concepts and equations."
3,"Basic, but might not be simple enough....","Although this book seems pretty widely respected and used, my usage of this book (which was a text for a course in political data analysis and not econometrics) was relatively infrequent. not discounting the need to state all of the maths involved in econometrics, I'd suggest that for a student new to the field, Studemunds ""Using Econometrics"" provides a better introduction on how to actually USE these tools (and a fairly good.... although not as good as in this book! explanation of the mathmatics, etc. involved....)Perhaps for a Ph.D. student.... this might be a great book to have.... I like it.... I just like the Studemund better.... especially if added to by SAGE paperbacks when more specific information is needed...."
5,Wow,I have owned this tv for about 1 year and it is about the most user friendly hdtv on the market today. And the picture is awsome with a high def. feed. This tv is a great value with all the goodies!!!
4,Great features at a great price.,"I can't believe no one else has reviewed this TV. The C32V37 looks great sitting next to a Sony HDTV, with perhaps a little red shift. The case design is clearly a copy of Sony's.This set had all the features on my list including DVI inputs, 16:9 enhanced mode, a cool zoom feature that fills the screen by stretching 16:9 HD signals, and (of course) a built in hdtv tuner. We'll see whether the tuner proves to be of any use to cable subscribers. I have seen posts on other sites suggesting a few local hdtv channels were unscrambled and this TV could tune several digital channels in addition to the standard analog channels. This probably varies by provider.I purchased this TV yesterday and it will be delivered in a few days. I hope Zenith's spotty reputation for quality control doesn't prove to be true in my case."
5,badass,This is one great album. These boys rock out with the best of them. Full of great melodies and tales of teenage love. Check them out.
1,WOW! . . . not.,"i didn't enjoy this book. it was not funny, and it was not interesting.Minnie is the main character. the book is supossed to be loke the life of a real teenage girl, but it's not. most girls don't have affairs with their mom's boyfriends. overall, the book was kinda disappointing."
2,Mystery Classics Vol.6,Frankly couldn't enjoy because the sound was not clear enough to understand. The film may have been good but when the sound is difficult to hear you lose in the interpretation.
1,Better used as a doorstop,"I just received this guide and really wish I hadn't taken the advice of the single other reviewer. I am currently planning a tent camping trip with a focus on the National Parks of Utah and Colorado. Then majority of the sites reviewed in this book are private campgrounds and KOA's!As example, of the 85+/- Colorado campgrounds detailed, eleven are operated by state/local authorities and two are operated by the National Forest System -- the other 70 plus sites are run by private operators. Within the NPS in Colorado (Rocky Mountain, Mesa Verde, Black Canyon of Gunnison, and the Great Sand Dunes to name a few) there are no less than 10 campgrounds -- yet none of these are covered in this guide!If your desire is for tent camping and to gather information on the National Park system you are better off to find another source. If you want to pull your RV into a KOA then this guide may be of some use."
5,Slednecks Rocks!,"My girlfriend is ready to burn this DVD because she's seen it about 4 or 5 times.It rocks!Unbelievable scenes: Cliff jumping, helicopter sledding, 200foot jumps, jumps over ski chalets, mountain climbs in Iceland, the world's first Ski Doo backflip, and much much more. All to an obnoxious new-rock soundtrack that fits this video to a tee. Could've edited out the dippy MTV girl in one segment. After a guy crashes trying to jump over a ski lift, her insightful comment: ""All Bad! All Bad! OH OH OH!!!"" Well, duhhhhhhh......If you have any interest in snowmobiling, you'll love this one too. Kids don't try this at home!Notice these guys are all in their 20s and kinda NUTS!"
2,Lacie 500gb Big Disk,"We purchased the BigDisk in December 2003 to act as a secondary backup for our office.For the first few days it worked perfectly, install was quick and easy and the back up of data was very fast. Then without warning the drive letter was gone, and looking up the ""computer management"" tool reported the BigDisk as ""unformatted"". Er, not a good sign. All our data was lost. We've since had to reformat the drive at least 4 times - and we are at the final straw.I've just written to Lacie to request a fix, as there was nothing relevant in their FAQs. Lets hope they come back with some clue as to what's wrong with the unit. I should point out that the Disk becomes extremely hot with use."
1,From a 10 year old,"I think this is a good toy while it lasts but,its not very good because it breaks very quickly. My brother had 2 and they both broke. Its not an educational toy. I found it too hard to use because I couldn't get the truck to move. That might be different for other kids because I don't weigh very much. They should discontinue selling it in the store."
4,Mar Hollis is on this album,"The individual named John Cope is inactuality Mark Hollis. These segments were recorded between Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock. It is minimalist and not your usual seven year venture out by MH, but I believe well worth it."
2,Disappointing,"Honestly I was really looking forward to this cd because of all the positive reviews. Being a big fan of Mark Hollis (solo and with Talk Talk) I expected a lot. It was quite a disappointment when I heard it.Do not expect something close to Talk Talk. Most of this cd sounds more like The Art of Noise (but not as good). The one (and only) track played by Mark Hollis sounds like his solo cd, but it does not really got me like his solo album.I will propably sell this cd, something I almost never do..."
1,JUNK!!!,"What a frustrating piece of garbage. I bought one at the local Office Depot, got it home, and realized that, despite the claims on the packaging to staple from ""2 to 25 sheets"", it wouldn't do either. Thinking I just got a bad one, I went back to the OD, and discovered they were out. I drove a few miles to the next OD, also out, (Back To School time). I waited a week, then was finally able to exchange it yesterday. Same results. Junk. At least 50% of the time, the staples stick inside the stapler, so you have to pull hard to free it. When it is free, you'll notice that the staples, (and yes, I am using the recommended staples), aren't bent flat. So if you are stapling 5 sheets, for example, which is within claimed capability, (2<5<25), you will have either the top of the staple or the bent over pieces on the other side sticking out, ready to catch and scratch stuff.It's going back, and I am a bit peeved at how much of my time I have wasted on this stapler."
5,love love love law and order svu,I thought season 13 wouldn't be good because of Christopher Meloni no longer on the show but I was proven wrong the cast is wonderful and now everybody is involved in the case instead of just the main two people
2,Sissy bar bag,"Side pockets got real wet while I was caught in a rain storm. Needleess to say I was dissappointed. Nicefair weather bag lousy inclement weather bag.Fast delivery, Good communications.You would be better served buying a higher quality bag.I would not recommend this bag to a friend"
5,Not just what but why,"Chris goes to length to tell you not just what to do, but why your are doing it. I believe the intention of the video is to educate someone while taking them through a workout. Chris has a pretty good sense of humor displayed throughout the video. I suspect you will find yourself chuckling here and there.It is a good workout and a great building block for your own fitness program. It is probably the best video exploration of PT I have seen. Certainly the first to make me laugh with the instructor and the first to explain why certain things are important.If you progress beyond this tape, try the other tapes starring Chris. Oh my. If you can honestly do them all ... wow."
5,The Office: Seasons One and Two,This is a great deal! If you buy both seasons together you definately save. This is based on the British version and is just as funny if not better. I'm very happy with my purchase.
5,Great Series,"The Office has quickly become one of my favorite tv series. It's both hilarious and heart warming with zany characters, clever dialogue and a story line that keeps you coming back for more."
5,Great Quilt Guide,"Granny Quilt book by Darlene Zimmerman is very helpful for a beginning quilter, as well as those already familiar with some quilting techniques."
1,Leslie Sansone,"Old material, very very disappointed. The material looks like it is from her old exercise dvds, all combined in one"
4,Walk Away the Pounds,As with all of Leslie's videos...she talks a bunch. I do however enjoy her workouts and feel that you can easily increase the intensity by doing each move with ankle and wrist weights or decrease the intensity by doing each move slower. All of her DVD's are similar because the moves don't change just the people in the recording and the placement of each move.It is a good alternative to walking outside. Her series have helped me with my weight loss goals and weight management. I lost 13 pounds in 4 months doing her workouts...that includes the times where I did not eat the way I should. The one thing I love about her workouts is how inspiring and encouraging she is¡Kwhich is why I can get over how much she talks :)
2,"Gaiam vs Anchor Bay, Old vs New",I agree with the other reviewers who love Leslie's walking workouts but were disappointed to find this 2012 DVD was previously released workout materials from years ago. What I believe I've discovered is that any DVD where the Studio is listed as Gaiam seems to contain Leslie's old material. Any DVD listing Anchor Bay as the Studio seems to contain her new workouts. I will now be ignoring the release dates and focusing on the Studio information when deciding to purchase Leslie's workout DVDs.
3,Only 4 flavors.,"I only got the soda, cherry, strawberry and strawberries and creme flavor. Regular sized pops. But very disappointed I didn't get more than 4 flavors!"
4,chupa chups,"I love these lollipops, was a little bummed that none of the creme ones came in it though. but still loved the flavors I got."
4,Good candy choice,"I took these into the office and they were a hit. Good assortment of flavors, tasty, and vitamin fortified is a nice benefit. Would be five stars, but a little pricey, especially with shipping."
2,Surprise!!! There are NO CHOCOLATE lollipops!,"I'm not one to really write a lot of reviews but i thought since i would have liked to have known this before ordering i should take a few min out to rite a review.So i ordered this 5lb Assortment for a friend of mine who LOVES chupa chups...Upon arrival, we noticed in this huge 5lb bag of chupa chups there was NO Choco Vanilla lollipops. Seriously, NOT EVEN ONE!!I do realize it says there is no guarantee what flavors will come BUT you would assume in a 5lb (36pop/1lb) assortment you would receive a few of the choco vanilla ones!NOT even ONE!HUGE disappointment considering its one of the most popular and our favorite flavor.If your ok with all the other flavors listed go ahead and order, BUT just know that whatever ur favorite is, you may not even get one in the 5lb bag!"
5,It Works!,"The Conair Ionic Hot Air Brush works like a charm. My hair is dry in less than 10 minutes, my hair is shiny and easily styled. The smaller brush really does make my hair shinier."
2,Don't bother...,"If you have long, thick hair, don't bother wasting your money on this ""dryer"". I had to have a substitute dryer that had a brush and/or comb feature to get through my hair. I thought this one may do a good job (first time I've tried one like it), but I couldn't have been more wrong.After 30 minutes (using both high and low) the hair on my scalp was still damp to wet, the ends were flying and frizzing like nobody's business, and there was no way to style the hair around my face without ripping skin with the bristles.The handle is extremely large and way too slick; my hand kept sliding all over the place, hitting the high/low selector button and slipping up onto the barrel of the brush part - OUCH! There needs to be some sort of ""stop"" rim put up there to keep your hand from hitting that and getting burned!Time to go back to the tried & true Vidal Sassoon 1875 - that one really DOES work! This piece of junk is going back!"
4,Easy and cheap!,"I have been considering the Instyler for a long time and opted to try this one first due to the good reviews and way cheaper price. A good move! Its not perfect, but I do like it and its pretty easy to use. I have shoulder length thick, course, slightly wavy hair. I still have to use a flat iron on the stubborn spots if I want my hair to look really perfect - but this a so much better than using a round brush and heavy blow dryer. The only con is that both attachmnets are not ionic -- only the big one."
4,Good condition,"As I live in Freshwater I thought it would be facinating to see what the antics of the locals was like. Very funny, and book is in perfectly good condition..."
3,Use olive oil for a healthy choice,"It says no oil needed, but it does to achieve a very good and thin consistency. Glad a friend of mine came to our child's bday party and helped my husband worked it through the machine and chocolate, she was liberal on oil. Use olive oil for a healthy choice. Overall, my fondue was a hit, everyone loved it! We're having another choc waterfall this New Year's celeb."
3,Works ok.,"This item works as described. The complaints that I have are: 1. It is kinda hard to get the consistency of the chocolate right so it works correctly. 2. This thing is loud and annoying. We bought it for our family get together during thanksgiving, and we had to keep shutting it off due to it being loud. Other than those 2 things, it works and it is cheap. I would recommend that you spend a few more bucks, and get a better unit that is quieter."
3,It was alright,"I used it for my graduation party. We were indoors on level ground, but the chocolate didn't flow very evenly. but it worked out okay and everyone loved it."
3,mini fountain,"I bought this for a girlss' 10 yr old birthday party. The kids had a ball with it but it never did work like it looked on the picture. The third fountain tier just dribbled chocolate. I thought it was because there wasnt enough chocolate but even when we filled it to capacity, the third ""fountain"" never flowed. The kids didnt seem to mind though...the chocolate tasted great and they thought it was wonderful."
1,Never heated up!!!,"I bought this for a special event. I heated it up at home before the event and it seemed to work fine. However, when I set it up for the big night the unit didn't heat enough to keep the warmed chocolate flowing. In fact the whole mechanism froze up because the previously warmed chocolate cooled down and hardened! Don't buy this unit!"
2,Its not HOT enough in here,"I actually really like this product. The problem is, if youre not in a hotter area, the Chocolate does not flow as pretty as it should (which might be why another suggested use thinner chocolate).The plate does not get hot enough in my opinion, and theres no real way to adjust it. You have 1 heat setting labeled ""Heat"". If you could make the plate hotter, this would work much better"
5,intriguing,"I actually have enjoyed all her novels.and her writing style allows you to love, then hate and love again her historical characters."
5,Excellent Product,"I am extremely satisfied with this drive enclosure. It is a bit pricey, but very solid. Installing the drive was quick and simple, and with the FireWire 800 it is VERY FAST! Comes with everything but the drive and works great."
3,Disappointed,"Yes, the Blu-Ray picture is better than the DVD version. The movie is still as good it was. Not much credulity is needed until the end.No, the only extra is one trailer. The DVD has an alternate soundtrack with the director and actors, a short movie, bloopers, trailers, etc.The improved picture is not enough better."
4,Gave Mailbug to elderly parent for gift,I recently gave my father a Mailbug for his birthday as I felt he would be intimidated by a computer. He really liked the large keys and the very readable screen. The only down side is the transmission of messages can take hours and sometimes up to a day. Perhaps it has to do with the service in his area. Overall it was a great gift and now he can communicate with his ten children.
5,Simply Amazing,"The quality of the leather, workmanship and design of this boot is simply amazing and almost unbelievable at this price. I would have paid triple the price for a boot like this. It is perfect in all ways."
5,Great Comic!,"Egg Story is quite an adventure in showing what a few eggs get up to as they fight for their freedom from the frying pan. It is intense, scary, amusing, exciting and intriguing. The pictures are great and very well detailed.I recommend this comic book story to anyone who is up for a good adventure."
4,Creative Questioning and Sensitive Listening Techniques: A Self-Concept Approach,Every teacher should have this book as part of their instructional library. The techniques and supportive research are as applicable today as they were when the book was first written. I use the information to guide teacher candidates during their internships and student teaching in classrooms. It is an easy read and applicable to varied instructional settings.
1,Should have read all of the reviews,WARNING : Enclosure doesn't pull in enough power for my Seagate's 250G Barracuda *sigh* ... So... if you have anything bigger than 160-200 be weary
3,How Many?,"I wish to purchase these from you, however, there add does not tell you how many are for the price. I am sure that the price shown is not for one, that would be inappropriate.Tom"
5,Litle Jordan Ray's Muddy Spud,"Bought this book for my two Grand Daughters, age 2 and 4. Will be some time before they get to enjoy it but it looks like a winner to their Gran Pa."
3,For SMALL pet,This is cute for a very small pet. My terrier/chihuahua mix weighs 13 pounds and is too big for it.
4,fun with numbers and food,A fun way of learning about calculus. The author has taken a very neighborhoody way of presenting a somewaht complex subject matter to his readers.
5,This book is a satisfying spiritual guidepath.,"I was, at first, simply curious about Candy Abbot's book. Candy and I attended the same high school many years ago, although we did not know each other, and we will soon be attending a long-awaited reunion. When I heard that she had written a book, I just had to see what it was about. What I found in Fruit-Bearers has been life-changing. Reading it has been like carrying on a heartfelt conversation with an intimate friend. Candy tells the story of her spiritual journey in such a way that any of us can relate to the trip. In reading the book, you will feel more comfortable with your own spiritual journey and will be able to take comfort in the knowledge that you are not alone in the bumps, ruts, scenic views and comfort-stations that you will encounter along the way. For those seeking a closer relationship with the Lord, or for those who already have a close relationship and simply want to review the trip, this book is a must-read!"
2,Art Book-? Yes. Design Guide? No Way,"If you'd like a beautiful art book to display on your coffee table that attests to what you do for a living (designing Web sites, typography, software, interiors, etc.), then this book would be a good option. If you want real information about design, and guidance to improve your design skills, keep on looking. You will be disappointed in a book with illegibly tiny type for its body text (I know, I know, this book is about designing for users' needs first and good looks second).I feel sad to have to report this, because Ms. Baggerman seems to write well (yes, I suffered through reading all the 6 pt. and smaller type), and has useful information to present, as well as interesting examples. Unfortunately, the designers got in control of this project, and the editorial staff didn't rein them in. Design for Interaction is a treat visually. For usability, however, it undoubtedly lacks."
5,This is solid and holds air very well!,"I bought this about 6 months ago, looking to get rid of my desk chair at home.It did take some getting used to, and it took two adjustments for me to get it to a good inflated size, but since then I've been using it daily and haven't had to add air yet! it does not show any signs of stretching out or getting out of its shape. I'm really happy with my purchase of this, and i might get another one and get rid of my chair at work to improve my core and bad posture habits."
3,good fitness ball but I don't like its plug.,"I'm a little bit over 5'5"" so wasn't sure which one I should buy, 55 cm or 65 cm. Last ball I owned was 55 cm and it felt a bit small so this time I bought 65 cm. I think I made a right choice. I don't need to blow a ball to its maximum size to get right height (knee bent at a 90 degree angle when I sit on it) which makes the ball not too hard. When I used 55 cm I needed to blow it to almost max size so the ball was quite hard and not flexible. Overall I like this ball but my only complain (the reason for 3 stars not 4 stars) is a plug. Somehow it is quite hard to insert fully into the hole and hard to pull it out. I know it's not a big problem and tightness may help to seal it but my previous ball's plug was a lot easier to handle and didn't leak. Other than this, it's a good ball."
2,Smaller than advertised and lop-sided,"As other reviews state, this ball is smaller than advertised. I just got mine and inflated it to quite firm, and it's A. egg shaped (not round) and B. Smaller than 65 cm. About to return it. It's also rock hard (I tried to get a few extra pumps in) and not very comfortable."
5,Exactly What I Wanted,"I'm 6' 150 pounds and feel fine using this ball. The set-up was easy, the ball is durable and the size is good.Chest flies, sit-ups, bench press and leg lefts all work fine with this ball. Fortunately, there's an exercise poster showing various workouts you can do with the ball. I've used this ball for about three months continually and haven't had any problems.There are a few points you should know about the ball:1)Don't put in the white air pin in all the way though. It's an enormous pain to get back out again. But leaving inserted 75% works fine.2)Don't leave the ball leaning against a wall. I did accidentally and part of the paint tore off when I grabbed the ball later on. That was my fault though."
1,no plug so it leaks!,just put in for a refund...ball came with no plug so the air just leaks out after you pump it.
2,well,"i love it, i got this to make home exersice but one issue, the ball missed the lil thing that makes the air stay inside, so mean that i cant use the ball, pefect, so please confirm all the piezes before you get it. only missed the most important part besides that all good."
4,LELANDL,"this fitness ball serves it's purpose well.You can use it as a chair, as a exercise ball, or just to do crunches/sit-ups."
4,Very sturdy ball,"Very good quality exercise ball, and it comes with a great brochure to remind you of some good exercises you can do with the ball. The pump is pretty straightforward and they give you an extra plug for the air hole, in case you lose the first. Seems very sturdy so far. Dont be afraid to inflate it as much as possible - it can handle the pressure."
5,Fast Service!,"Honestly, I haven't even blown it up yet, but I wanted to say that I ordered this yesterday and got it today! That is terrific. I am going to blow it up now but I am sure it will be perfect. Thanks Amazon for the fast service!"
4,Office Chair,"I am a slave to the office day after day, I'm always looking for something new & exciting to liven up my day. I also have a history of bad lower back pain and recently upper back pain. I saw the ball chairs (with the frames that hold the ball). Too expensive to try it out, so I bought this ball just to see what I thought. I bought the 75mm because I am 5'10, and I would rather it be too big than too small. It's only been 2 days but I am loving it so far. I can bounce when a good song is on, or I'm having a bored moment... I can roll around and stretch on a whim. It is making me use core muscles to balance, in a subtle way, I only notice it later when my muscles are sore like I've been working out. I have no problem without the frame for the ball, and not sure that I think it's worth the $70 or so more just to put it in a frame. I am on a plastic roller chair mat and my ball's not going anywhere.I will update as time passes to see if I still like it!"
3,A good ball,"I received this ball and was very excited I opened it up got it pumped up only to discover that I pumped it up for no reason. It didn't have a plug. I called tko and they were very good about getting one to me. When I called they took my mailing info and had one to me in about 3 days. Glade they got me one but a little sad that the product didn't come with one.For my height this is the size ball that is recomended but I found it to be a little to small, so I will be having to purchase a larger ball. I have used it a few times till I get the bigger ball and it does well."
5,Sexy silver!,"I love this ball, I don't even mind if I leave it out at my home. It has a bit of sparkly in it. Totally different texture than my old ball. The ""Anti Burst"" feature sold me as after 4 years w/ my old call it bursted on me during a ""Pilates on the Ball Session"" luckily I wasn't hurt. (If I had been turned the other direction I could have smacked my head on the coffee table on the way down.)So I went online and found this beauty to replace it. Love the foot pump too, felt like it inflated faster than my old hand pump."
5,Bought this for a computer seat,"I bought this last month to use instead of a chair when I am sitting at my home computer. It was very easy to inflate and, so far, has held the air. I haven't used it for any other exercises yet, but the instructions came with some recommendations that look interesting."
3,Good,This fitness ball is a good start for those who have back pain and want to try to get back into shape. I use it to stretch my back and sit on it while I use the computer for posture.:)
2,Too small,"The ball seems to be decent quality, but it is not the advertised size. It is way too small. (I have a little tape that is exactly the length of the circumference of a 55cm ball for measuring.)"
2,Not the correct size,I actually ordered this ball in 2 different sizes; the 65cm and the 75cm. When I inflated the 65cm it was MUCH smaller than it should have been. I compared it with another 65cm ball I have from a different manufacturer and the sizes were not even close. It was the same situation with the 75cm ball ... actually it was only a tiny bit bigger than the 65cm ball. I won't order another ball made by this manufacturer.
3,It lasted over a year... then it burst and put me on the ground!,"I can't really complain, I guess, because I got over a year out of this thing. Then again, 2 hours ago I was sitting at my desk when this TKO ball just DISAPPEARED on me! I mean, it was instantaneous - from sitting on the ball to sitting (somewhat painfully) on the floor. Maybe I should proactively replace these things after 11 or 12 months?"
4,Go a size up/ pump is hard to use,Overall pleased with the ball. Very sturdy and works well as an exercise ball.I used the size chart to find the recommended size for my height and was surprised to see how small it was - I would probably go a size bigger next time. The pump is pretty hard to use and it took 2-3 times for me to put the plug in without a large amount of air coming out.
4,good enough,"ball seems to be working pretty well. the pump was REAL cheap; broke during the pumping up, but i was able to just tape it up and it worked fine. all in all, you're lucky to get it for $13 or whatever as it is."
1,Not 65cm,"These people need to buy a tape measure. As others have noted, it is a 55 cm. TKO can print whatever they want on the side but it is not 65 cm. Further, it is not nearly as sturdy as a previous fitball. The only advantage is that this is inexpensive. Unfortunately it is also cheap."
1,55cm is not for everyone,"SO ON AMAZON http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZJA0/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_details YOU SELL THIS PURPLE BALL which on your web site it shows purple is for 5.2 and under, it says this nowhere on amazon page it is not until you open the package do you find that there is different sizes per height so i really need theBall sizing guidelines:Sku Size Color Chair Exercise Price44827 45cm Yellow n/a 4'1"" - 5'1"" $28.9544828 55cm Purple 5'2"" & under 5'2"" - 5'8"" $33.4944829 65cm Blue 5'2"" & over 5'7"" - 6'2"" $37.9544830 75cm Silver 6'0"" & over 6'3"" & over $41.95fyitrying to exchange"
4,Good quality for a good price,"I was pleasantly surprised at the good quality for the price. Size was right for me, and ball retains its inflation well. The only thing I would change is the pump that comes with it - would have paid a few $$ more for a better pump. I will say that it worked fine, just takes a while."
2,Not Very Happy with Ball,"We received this ball without any instructions what-so-ever. Received that hand pump as well, but no instructions on how much air we can put in it or any kind of help with this product at all. I would spend a little more and try another one."
4,got 2 plugs,"I was nervous about the reviews saying people got this missing plugs. I got two! only 4 stars since the pump is super cheap. If it bursts I""ll update."
4,bouncy ball,"It is blue, it holds air, (once you have the stopper that should have come with it) and seems to work like every other stability ball I've ever seen.It was a bummer that the plug that was supposed to be in the box was missing, but with a call and a few days wait it arrived in the mail and I was all set. The pump that it comes with does fine for inflating it, so no complaints here.To really add value, I recommend getting a dark sharpie pen and making a fun face on the side!"
4,Durable!,"I've had this item about 2 months now and only once have I needed to add air, and only a few pumps of it. The pump itself is flimsy and requires 2 hands, but I've noticed with other exercise balls I've owned that it's the same issue. The only thing I wish would be different is the color - I use this as a chair at work and I've gotten quite a few stares. A grey/silver or even a more muted blue would have worked better!"
5,PHANTASTIC,"Well, there really is only one word to describe this 7-DVD set: FANTASTIC.You get 6 DVDs full of music, one bonus disc with interviews, the (almost) hour-long soundcheck, and all of that in a beautiful box (not like the one from the Roxy release) with a 50 page booklet and a set of photographs. What more could you ask for?If I could I'd give this set 10 stars ..."
5,"""As Good As It Gets""...","I Love Phish, so set your bias levels at what you will...This production is wonderful. The video and audio are as good as the playing! I can only hope that the band will release this quality of DVD from 1997 and 1998 as well!If the Beatles had remained friends then they would have put something as good as this out as well! Please get this DVD set as it will BLOW YER MIND...Thanks Guys!!!"
1,IF I COULD RATE IT A ZERO I WOULD!!!!!!,"I had been enjoying this book up until page 102 - where the author has written a joke about sex and said that jokes like that can ""trigger good conversation"". I may be old school, but, I am sitting here in SHOCK that I read a nasty, vulgar, tasteless joke like that in a supposedly Christian book, ESPECIALLY one about hospitality and manners!!!"
3,"Cute, but not really so great","We actually have the Trackmaster line (note that this holder is for the Wooden Railway), but I thought I'd try it anyways because I couldn't find a Trackmaster case. Well, the engines and cars from Trackmaster don't fit in at all and I had to remove the plastic organizer trays. Now the engines and cars can fit in, but they don't fit well and they slide around too much to even move the caddy without everything falling out. Although it's cute, this has ended up being a waste of space and I wouldn't recommend buying it for storage of Trackmaster."
2,A Little Disappointed,"I'm not that impressed with this item. I purchased this item because I need to fall asleep with noise of some kind (tv, sound machine, radio...) So I thought this would be perfect to travel with. Well, it's hard to get the time set, turn on the sounds, control the volume, basically anything. The buttons just don't work very well. For example, if you press the button to turn the volume up sometimes it will suddenly be blasting, or it will turn the volume down instead. I think it works fine once you get it set. It's just a hassle getting it set where you initially want it."
5,Required Reading for Golf Enthusiasts,"To the Linksland has something for everyone: a look inside a pro tour, an intimate view of Scottish golf, and, most of all, an accurate depiction of the never-ending quest for improvement and the associated cycles of hope and despair that all golfers experience. Bamberger manages to evoke these weighty themes without crossing over the line into contrived mysticism or gross sentimentality. I re-read it every spring, when it's still too cold to play but I need a golf fix. My favorite golf book, it captures the true spirit of the game!"
2,Shoe size runs extremely small,"I absolutely loved these shoes the minute I saw them. Tried them on and they were way too small. If you order these shoes make sure you order them in a full size bigger. Also, in my opinion I feel there wasnt much cushion in them....but because they are so cool I was willing to overlook that fact and figured I could just get a cheap insert pad if I had to. I did have to return them and could not get another pair because the largest size was a 10 - I was highly disappointed ;("
5,"""first"" best describes the music and this artist","... This album of songs can make me think, motivate me, feel content, and feel sad, and give me an inner peace like no other. I have three ""first"" albums as the many times I played them, the sound quality is less than good. I was elated to see this album finally released on CD format. My only disappointment is that this is an English import as the only other Gates solo album from his '70's/early 80's releases on CD is ""Goodbye Girl"" as a Japanese import. ... If you want to hear David Gates open himself up in song and verse like no other artist I have ever heard, buy this CD. I promise you will not be disappointed."
3,Read The Economist instead,"I've read 130 pgs of this book and I'm going to put it away. I'm not hooked by it. I'm an American living in Taiwan and read the Economist regularly. So perhaps I'm not the audience the author is addressing. Basically from reading the Economist and keeping up on China in the media I feel most of his information is dated. Ohmae's style has a lot of filler and not much substance. I get the impression that his audience is older Japanese business people who are perhaps not aware of what is going on with the rise of China. I bought this book because I recently read J. Siegel's Future For Investors and thought highly of Wharton Publishing.On the positive side, the author's emphasis on the rise of the region state is important to consider. The coverage of the rise of Ireland provides useful insights. Perhaps for American business people who aren't in touch with Asia this book could be important. I recommend Inc's 3/05 article ""How China will Change Your Business"" by Fishman."
2,I expect more.,"I bought it for my ACCA P3 study and for personal interest.I found that lots of ""history"" in the book in the first 2 chapers.I feel it not bad but not so impressive. Maybe I should have read it 7 years ago."
4,Enjoyed the Show,"The divas were very good. Actually better than when I saw them live. I'm giving 4 stars because the editing was choppy and some of the best performances were put under the 'extras'. The performances were haunting, funny, energetic, majestic...I could go on. There is something there for everyone."
2,Not the good read I expected from Beverly Lewis,"I didn't even realize that Beverly Lewis was a Christian author until I read this book. Sure Abraham's Daughter series had quite a bid of Christian revelation in it, but the story was compelling. This book was predicatable from the start. The heroine's unhappy childhood seemed far fetched. The story line was incredibly unbelievable. I had a hard time believing that a modern day family from New England would up and convert to the Amish way of life and even harder time believing that a loving parent would select as gaurdian an estranged sister. Not to mention the Chrisian theme was dominating versus Ms. Lewis's other novels where it was simply part of the story. If Christin books aren't your thing than this book is not for you. If your looking for a believable plot this book isn't for you. this book is way to heavy handed with the Christian awakening of the heroine."
3,The Princess Present,"This was enough to keep me entertained for the moment inbetween novels, but if it would have been any longer I would have fallen asleep. I honestly don't get the point, except Lilly and Michael are coming to Genovia for Christmas and Lilly makes a mess and Mia is trying to find the perfect gift for Michael. Funny how it turns out...I guess it was okay, but I really like the novels better than the novellas."
2,"Great at first, but disappointing performance as time goes on--flimsy construction","I've purchased this Archos 20 GB USB 2.0 mini hard drive a year ago. When it was new, it worked great. But as I've used it for a year, the USB connection jack on the hard drive gradually became loose. Eventually, it has become a daunting task to wiggle the USB cable just to re-establish hard drive connectivity to my computer. As I write this review, my Archos 20 GB mini hard drive is officially dead and not connecting anymore.Archos has a one year limited warranty. Unfortunately, the hard drive no longer works just a bit after a year of operation.It's a great product if you plan on using it for a year. Unfortunately, the construction of the connection port is less than sturdy."
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"When I first looked at the title and saw the word ""Essential,"" and then the track listing, I was disappointed, expecting a more thorough mix of the ""old"" and the ""new."" But this CD is a very pleasant surprise, in that it presents songs that are not the typical ones you would expect to encounter in compilations such as this. It is a very ""mellow"" collection that will provide pleasant listening and relaxation, on the couch or behind the wheel. A pleasant surprise indeed!"
2,From Back Cover,"Katherine Inskip's ideal man didn't exist in this century. Nevertheless, her dreams and the books she wrote were dominated by a swashbuckling pirate. She'd never imagined she'd encounter him in the flesh... until she met Jared Hawthorne.Owner of the South Seas island where Kate was unwinding, Jared could have stepped off the pages of a historical romance. In almost every way was her perfect fantasy - bold, dashing, domineering... But when Kate began to suspect that Jared had something more in common with his piratical ancestors - something that wasn't all 'by the book...'1st in trilogy."
2,2 1/2 stars,"The heroine in this book was just not that likable. She complained too much. Also, there was no passion in this story. It was like, 'Oh, there's a connection between these two people? Really? When did that develop?'The story just wasn't interesting as well. I never really understood the plot, partly because I was so bored reading this that I was only half paying attention. I liked Jared though in the love scenes; his dialogue is sexy. But the story was flat so I couldn't fully enjoy them. I only really enjoy books under Amanda Quick, sometimes some under Jayne Ann Krentz, but this one was just not as good as her usual books."
2,Don't get Stuck with this Waffle Sticks maker!,"This waffle maker has a very poor design, mainly due to the fact that the steam from making a waffle will heat the button you must push in to lift the lid, requiring you to use a potholder to lift the lid. Also, the sticks that are made often have one side that has a very poor appearance due to the fact that you can't fill the slots with enough batter without it overflowing over the sides. The bell that rings when the waffle sticks are done is a nice touch, but you would be better off buying the Hamilton Beach model for less than half the price."
1,This utensil holder ships WITHOUT the spoon holder,"As you can see in the photo provided by the manufacturer, the utensil holder has a stainless steel spoon rest in the front of the item. That spoon rest can be removed and used to set spoons on. However, the utensil holder as shipped to me did not come with the spoon rest. It even has marketing/instructional material on it with an arrow pointing to the spot where the spoon holder should be and says ""removeable spoon rest"" but has no spoon rest with it. I shipped the holder back and then received yet another holder without a spoon rest. So, I guess I'll have a utensil holder with a big black hole in it where the spoon rest should be. I would not buy it again."
5,Yay it works,"What's there to review? I needed an IDE USB/Firewire enclosure during the upgrade of my Powerbook HD, and it just works. Note the other review that mentions the lack of a truly unique Firewire ID: you may have problems if you use more than one Macally Firewire device on the same bus."
5,Very satisfied,Solidly-built HD enclosure. I needed the FireWire option so I could boot my Mac from the drive. Has an interesting extra USB cable to provide extra power if you need it for USB connectivity. Worked flawlessly with FireWire and no external power source. Very pleased with quality.
3,Please not that this is PATA not SATA,Just bought this enclosure for a 2.5 SATA drive. However this enclosure is only for PATA drives....so make sure you have the right connection. This should be clearer in the product description or else my eyesight is on the blink. Other than that the built quality is excellent.
5,Great enclosure,Comes with firewire which a lot of enclosures don't have. This allows it to plug into any computer and for older macs to boot from it. Simple to put together. Would definitely recommend.
5,Solid,"I`ve tried different types of enclosures for my hard drives, this is by far the best so far, its very rugged, neat design, and very easy to install..."
4,Doris Day and the Andre Previn Trio,"This CD transfer dates from a 1961 recording. Although only Previn and DD are billed, it actually involves the Previn Trio with Red Mitchell on bass and Frank Capp on drums. There are 12 tracks - mostly `standards', like Bernice Petkere's `Close your eyes', Bloom and Mercer's `Fools rush in', Rodgers and Hart's `Wait till you see him', `My one and only love', `Falling in love again'. But there are some less often heard numbers too - `Nobody's heart' from the 1942 Broadway show By Jupiter, which proved to be Rodgers and Hart's last collaboration; Sigmund Romberg's `Who are we to say' that Nelson Eddy sang to Jeanette MacDonald in the movie `The Girl of the Golden West', lyrics by Gus Kahn; Alec Wilder's `Give me time'. There are also three tunes by Previn, lyrics by Dory Previn (née Langdon): `Yes', `Control yourself' and `Daydreaming'. This is a relaxed and enjoyable CD if a little short on playing time by today's standards."
4,You can't go wrong with Cleveland Amory,"This book is a continuation of his adventures with Polar Bear. I didn't find it as compelling as the first or third books in the series, but well worth reading. It's quite humorous reading about how Polar Bear deals with fame."
3,Good Sound but too tight to the head.,"These Hphs. deliver in the sound dept, for the price but loose one star for being so tight to my head. Very uncomfortable after just a few minutes. I have a small/petite head so I'm dismayed that I can't alter the fit to fit!"
5,Simply Awesome!!,Been using these in school for a while and just thought I had to have a pair for myself. Really clean and clear and balanced. All my mixes that I have done on these translated really well on bigger systems. I was able to mix for 4+ hours on these without any noticeable ear fatigue. They are well worth the price and are a must have for anyone serious about audio.
5,Works Well After Some Thought,"I was apprehensive since I was planning on using this for a Hitachi Travelstar notebook drive as others were and thought I would give it a go. Low and behold when I first went to use it there was some difficulty that the computer had in recognizing the drive. After disassembling everything and thinking about it all I realized that there was different jumper configurations that could be used. Upon further inspection I noticed that the HDD was set up in the ""Cable Select"" jumper position. After changing the jumper to the ""Master"" position the drive was recognized by the computer and everything went swimingly. I don't know if this may have been the same problem that others had, or that the tech's at Macally even thought of the option.Really its a decent product for what it needs to do. For the price, I have no complaints."
5,For the price very good,"Did all that was advertised. For this price and the capability can't be beat. OK product for a great price. Well worth it.Also - not sure of the posts discussing the need for two USB connections for power, but this handled my 120 gig hd with ease using only the one USB connection for both a desktop machine and my laptop. It could well be different for individual computers."
3,Works,"I ordered this (as I'm sure many people do) to salvage a laptop drive. It worked well. I was able to pull out my 2.5"" HD and stick it in this enclosure then pull the files off over USB. I was the least expensive way to accomplish what I needed to accomplish.The enclosure comes with a USB data cable and a second USB power cable.The enclosure is not something I would ever consider using to turn a 2.5"" drive into a portable HD. The case is simply not tough enough for that kind of use.I didn't even put the silver enclosure back over my drive to use it. I just used the end-plate to adapt the drive over to USB and pulled my files. After the fact I wanted to put on the enclosure to protect the drive for storage and found that the little screws included for this were a bit hard to work with.Bottom line: need to connect a drive via USB this is a cheap and effective way of doing so."
4,Interesting 2nd book continuing a great story,"This book continues on from the earlier book, The well of eternity, i was so wrapped up in the story of the first book this was not a let down at all. I weas turning page after page so unravel the story. i can admit some sections began to repeat themselves slightly but i did indeed finsh this book within a week.A fantastic read and continuation of the war of the ancients series.4/5"
4,Alternate tunings or Irish music fans.,"This book went deep into Irish music played in DADGAD tuning on guitar. Songs are in tab with chords above. It teaches about music theory, and chord shapes for DADGAD. I ordered the cd from the company that made the book also, to hear all the tunes. This book is a must have for anyone into Irish music for guitar or just wanting to expand there guitar playing into alternate tunings."
3,"Overfills one cup, underfills the other","The diverter spout above the mugs does not send equal amounts to each mug. One fills to the point of overflowing while the other is barely more than half full. If I walk away while it's brewing, there can be a mess when I come back.It is an otherwise very nice little unit, and perfect if only brewing a quantity of one mug. A single mug can be brewed by placing it in the middle of the base, catching both streams of coffee from the diverter spout."
1,Nice Idea - but bad design,Was hoping this would work because I just needed one cup in the mornings - but it leaked all over the counter if you tried and use the two cup option. Works fine if you are brewing just one cup. Not worth the money.
1,Very Disappointed,I am VERY disappointed in this product. It did not work from day one when it was taken out of the box. It will not brew two cups of coffee without spilling over on to the counter. It seems it just keeps filling up one cup and cannot switch to the other. I would NOT recommend this item to anyone. It was a waste of time and money.
3,good for one cup,if you wanna have one cup then is it a good coffeemaker.but for two cups sucks. you have then one half full cup andone very full (1.5 full) cup
1,"Close,but no cigar...","First of all,I am not a coffee ""afficianado"".My life is not defined by the coffee I drink.I like the products I buy to work efficiently.This machine doesnt really do that.First,the point of a lid on a travel mug is to keep the coffee in the cup.The lid would need to stay on the cup securely.These dont.The plastic liner also pops out at its liesure as well.Travel mug?No.The ""maker"" itself works pretty well,except for the tendency to spill water that is trapped in the lid from the previuos brew.I read some guys review in which he claims to use ""distilled water"" only.Well,I have a life.And it has largely NOT been made easier with this product"
1,"Cuisinart Much Better Quality, Watch out for ""Exploding"" cup","I also had the cups explode/separate. Very messy cleanup on the counters. Poor quality. I had the Cuisinart 2 to go for about 3 years and my mom decided to suprise me with a ""new"" one for Christmas. Well, after giving away my still perfectly working Cuisinart, I have had several complaints including spilled coffee while driving from the loose and poor quality cups as well as the ""explosions"" written about by another reviewer. There is nothing worse than putting on your coffee, getting in the shower and then come down to leave for work and find a big messy puddle all over the kitchen counter. And then you have no time to make another cup because you will be late! That makes for a terrible morning and a terrible coffee maker."
2,Worked for 1 and a half months,It was nice while it lasted. My unit stopped working after 1 and a half months. When the button is pressed steam just comes out of the front and back and no coffee brews. oh well I guess you get what you pay for (25$).
2,very nice if you can get one that works properly,"I have now bought three of these. I was so excited to get it because it is so convenient. Unfortunately I have also returned three of these. They all three have dripped faster on the right side than on the left. Therefore, the right cup overflows and the left does not fill up. Works fine if you are only making one cup of coffee, but if you ever want to make two it is a little messy and frustrating. If I can get one that works I am sure I would rate it with five stars."
2,Not the Best!,"I bought this for my husband for christmas of 2002. It worked great at first and was great for on the go, but after a few months, the machine started leaking. It leaked from the bottom, about 1/2 cup total. Therefore the coffee would be stronger than intended. Also the cups started to leak out the bottom around the seal. As far as travel mugs, they don't fit in our car cup holders, so we would have to transfer the coffee into other mugs, which defeated the whole purpose."
1,Fiddly - fills 2 mugs unevenly - leaks on counter-top,"The maker needs to be ABSOLUTELY level or else one cup will overflow and the other will not fill at all. The unit is way too sensative about being even slightly tilted. My unit sat on a seam in the formica and one side was about 0.5mm higher than the other. That is enough to cause a flood of coffee that overflows the drip tray and flows onto the countertop.The way the water reservoir lid is attached makes it difficult to fill without spilling. The lid also drips 2cc of water when I raise it.It appears that water also leaks from the reservoir, but I haven't proven this conclusively yet; there is so much water everywhere it's hard to tell exactly how much of it is from each of the many faults.So far my mugs have held together...This appliance is an overall disappontment. All the little faults could be tolerated if there was only one, but the cumulation of many faults makes this coffeemaker one to avoid. NOT RECOMMENDED."
4,A decent coffee maker,"I ""inherited"" my Melitta Take 2 coffee maker from a co-worker who left recently, and I cannot comment on the quality of the mugs that come with the machine because she took the mugs with her.However, I bought a nice 16 ounce, stainless steel travel mug and have had no problems using that with the coffee maker instead of the original mugs.I use the machine to make one cup of coffee at a time; I never need 2 cups at once. For just one cup, it does a great job. It's fast, the coffee tastes fine, and the coffee comes out very hot.The one drawback I've noticed is that it keeps drip-drip-dripping for about 5 minutes after it's finished brewing, so I just stick an old ceramic coffee mug underneath to catch the drips after I pick up the travel mug.Oh, and by the way - I did what some other reviewers recommending for single-cup brewing, and popped off the silver distributor nozzle. It looks better without it and there's less splashing that way."
2,Disappointed..,"When I ordered the movie poster, I was thinking I would actually get an 11 x 17 poster, that would not have so much excess white space all around it. It was as if somebody just printed it out at home on regular paper and sent it.If I wanted quality of this sort for a poster, I would have made it myself and saved $13."
5,Just what I needed,"I bought this tumbler because I have had 3 computer keyboards ruined by dripping condensation off of my drink glass, not to mention water damage to my desktop. I have only used it for about one day but with an ice cold drink sitting on my desk for hours, not a single drop of condensation fell off of it. As others have pointed out, you can feel a very slight amount of moisture on the outside after a while, but it is so little that it is never enough to form a droplet or a ring at the bottom. I'm 100% confident I will never ruin another keyboard from condensation droplets as long as I use this great tumbler. I'm glad I found this, but I wish I would have found it sooner, it would have saved me the cost of 3 new keyboards, which probably cost me like $60-$80."
3,"Tumblers good, accessories not so much","I LOVE Tervis tumblers as I like to carry ice water in the car and this is a good solution over bottled water. HOWEVER, I am not at all happy with the lids and straws! The lids break easily and the straws get holes in them. All that can be done is to replace them, and they are expensive. I would suggest that they use the kind of plastic that Tupperware and Rubbermaid use so that this stops being a problem."
5,"Karajan, Or, Beauty As I see it","There are several DVDs on the market that treat the life and career of Herbert Von Karajan, this one is more balanced. Historically, it doesn't emphasize so much on Karajan's political affiliation, but concentrates most on his music making. That is, after all, where his fame rest. One could say the same for Richard Wagner."
1,Dont buy this!!,I bought this lotion and it was very watery and old. I have purchased the same lotion befor in my salon. This was not the CT-7 that is was suppose to be.
5,Fitness for Dummies Will Get You Fit,"Not only is this a great book filled with a lot of exercises, it also:* Dispels common fitness myths like, ""no pain, no gain.""* Outlines challenges to becoming fit.* It contains nutritional recommendations and sample programs.* Shows different ways to gauge your progress.* Gives critical prenatal fitness advice/warnings.* Provides tips on how to motivate your kids to workout.* Compares different methods/modes of achieving fitness.So many aspects of fitness are addressed here, like fitness club etiquette with detailed info. regarding various machines & what muscles they work out.This has helped me see how I was making the same mistakes that proved to be self-defeating to achieving my own fitness goals.This book cuts through many misconceptions, making it a great education in overall fitness."
3,Lives up to its Fitness for Dummies name,"A pure fitness novice may find this book useful as it truly lives up to its name of Fitness for Dummies. If you paid any attention during your high school or college PE courses or were active in any sport, you likely already know 60-90 percent of the information in this book. As a matter of fairness, I listened to the audio version, which appears to have left out several chapters that looked more interesting. Nevertheless, this book is only for the pure fitness novice, or perhaps, older Americans who would like to begin a fitness program after decades of inactivity. It also has a slight female slant--though not enough to deter males from reading it. I do believe the information to be accurate and helpful to the ultimate beginner."
5,This book is a domer,Everything Schlosberg writes is hilarious! She used to write for Shape magazine too.I was laughing so hard I didn't realize how much useful information the book gave me until I was finished.Anyone who doesn't give this book a 10 is a doofus
2,Not convinced,"Reading this book leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling. It raises as many questions as it answers. Mr Johnstone has written several other books, mainly biographies (Pattie Smith, Sean Penn) and inevitably glorifies the self-destructive nature of anyone he writes about. In this, his latest novel, the author pens his own memoirs. They are complete with the usual wild student tails of excess and drinking. However, it is the forced narcissistic attempt to equate these antics with the plight of the genuinely ill throughout the whole book that ultimately rings hollow. One has to question the author's motives in writing this book"
2,Pity the writing is so poor.,"I'm just finishing reading The Prince of Dreams, the second in the Seven Brothers trilogy. I bought books one and two not knowing how good of a writer Benjamin was, and unfortunately I have been very disappointed on that score.The author has obviously researched ancient Chinese history extensively and has crafted an interesting, vivid story. The problem is his writing abilities do not live up to the story he is telling. Often I am reading and find myself asking ""WHO is he talking about?"" ""That statement makes NO sense"", ""WHY is he telling something that he's already told us twice before?"" etc. His writing is stilted, forced and confusing in many places in the book.A pity. With more honed writing skills, this book could have been a huge winner. As it stands now, unfortunately I doubt I'll buy the third in the series."
2,"First book was good, the 2nd lost me....","I really enjoyed the first book by CB in this series, however, the 2nd novel could not keep my attention. I have always been a very earnest reader, often finishing the book in about a week. After two months, I still had to labor to even read a chapter here. I can't explain what was wrong, other than it bored me to death...imho."
2,filter body failure,Beware - if the filter traps water and is not changed the moisture will go after the powder coating inside the housing and then the aluminum. this requires complete replacement. I have never seen powder coating flake like this.
3,It's OK,"The waffles that this makes are very thin. Also if you happen to overfill the iron, it is very hard to clean, there is a seam that everything seems to collect in and is very hard to get out of. But the waffles do come out nicely, and the timer with an alarm is a nice feature."
1,Terrible design,"Got this as a wedding present and after one use, the hinge stopped working. It's supposed to have a subtle mechanism that locks when closed, but opens when the hendle is pulled.But the design is poor and after one use, the iron wouldn't open unless a knife is used to pry it open.Also, there is non-heating material on only part of the handle. I burned by hand on the burning hot metal of the handle, which is easy to do when handling it.So one of the poorest designs I've seen on a consumer product in many years."
4,Waffle Iron review,"This is your typical non-belgian style waffle maker. It has a nice contemporary/retro design to it. The warm up beeper is nice, as is the signal telling you the waffle is cooked and ready to pluck. Even with the non-stick grills, you still should spray PAM on them before each use, though, or the waffles will stick and are a bear to pick off the grills. It would be nice if they were removable so they could be washed, but I suppose that would just add to the price. All in all, a nice product for the $50 price. Enjoy!"
3,Try a different one,"I have just used this for the first time (made 4 waffles). The hinge doesn't work; it won't lock. So the green light, which is supposed to go off when you close it while the waffle cooks, doesn't go off. So I have to hold the handle down pressing down hard till the light goes off. I burnt my hand twice doing this since only part of the handle is heat-proofed. The waffles come out well for traditional waffles (I prefer Belgian and am thinking of getting the Waring). But it's too bad it doesn't work right right out of the box :-("
2,Planned Obsolescence,"I bought this product on December 31, 2005 and on June 1, 2009 the black non stick coating was all over the waffles. Since this was 6 months beyond the 3 year warranty Cuisinart told me I had to buy a new one. I used the waffle iron with non stick spray or butter and cleaned it according to the instructions. I expected it to last longer. I certainly did not buy another Cuisinart waffle iron. Is this planned obsolescence? I think so."
2,Real cars don't behave like this.,"First, I definitely have to give the designers of this game some credit for the really wonderful graphics. I'll admit that I may just not like this particular genre as much as I had hoped. But here's my problems with the game.*It's much too easy to roll your car. It's difficult to cut loose and run the car full throttle in this game because you're always rolling the car.*The tracks aren't particularly designed well--mostly just the same set of tracks on all the levels, with a little tweaking to make them SEEM different.*The English accented commentator is a bit rude at times and he tends to grate on your nerves a bit after a short time.There are several other complaints, but bassically, I am very dissappointed with this game."
5,Great racing game,"I rented just about every other racing game before buying this one.By far and away, it was the most fun. There is a nice variety of cars to choose from, and a large number of tracks. You're challenged to keep working at the game to unlock more tracks. There's a lot of realizm with flying gravel, cracked windshields, etc. Head-to-head is great (even my 65 year old Dad enjoyed it - when he could find his way back to the road!)What would make it better: Online play over Xbox Live. A ""beginner"" mode that made it harder for my kids (and father) to run off the track.The only alternate recommendation: if you like street racing more than off-road, then check out either Project Gotham or the Sega racing game."
4,finally a good racing game,"Ever since Grand Turismo, I have not been able to find a racing game that could even come close to the amount of fun I had with GT. RS Challenge is the best racing game I have played since GT, I would recommend it to any and all race fans. The graphics are amazing, and the sound is cool, I love the english guy telling me whats up next, and besides, you can make your own soundtrack. The controlls are second nature to pick up, and the cars handle in a way that is easy to controll, but there is still enough realizm in the way they handle to keep me happy. When I bought the game, my sister complained that I bought that one, but now she plays it more than I do, and she doens't usually like racing games. There is only one complaint I have with the game, and that is the multiplayer mode. If 2 controllers are connected, there are 2 cars racing, you cant add any computer controlled cars. but other than that, best racing game out."
3,Let's Race,"This game is pretty cool, and if you are a fan of the Rallisport series, you will not be disappointed. The game does not take advantage of xbox's awesome power, but it is very enjoyable."
5,Very Good Rally Game!!,"This game is extremely fun, I didn't think that it would be too fun but I gave it a chance. The graphics are excellent! This is a must have for all x-box owners."
2,pong was more fun,"When you see the intro scenes for Rallisport you think ""Wow! This is going to be great!"" Unfortunately, that's about as fun as it gets. Sure the graphics are awesome and the number of car and driver options are titilating, but the fun quickly runs out. I rented this game for the weekend, and definately would not buy it.I found the cars difficults to control, and even with hours of practice there were some tracks that I could never win on, even on the least difficult setting. In early career mode, most of the more interesting races, tracts, and cars are locked out. Until you achieve enough points you cannot get access to these advanced options. By the time you get enough points to get there, you no longer care.Definately failed to keep me interest."
3,Rent it First,"-Chad Steingraber--Paradigm/Infogrames--Level Designer/Game Designer/3D Artist on The Terminator: Dawn of Fate-Definately rent this one first. I borrowed it, played it for a day and then gave it back. It's not that it isn't good...because it is. I found it to be a lot of fun, but it's one of those games that you have fun with for about 4-5 hours and then don't want to play anymore. I raced all the tracks, tried as many cars as I could...and that was it. I didn't feel the need to play it much more. Maybe it's because the tracks aren't all that interesting? Maybe it's just because I like more of the ""smash 'em up demolition derby"" style racing? I don't know. If you LOVE rallisport, then you will love this game. It is by far the best of this genre on any platform. But like I said, it's best to rent this one first to see if you like it."
4,"Very easy to use and ideal for that in the field ""scouting"" training.",I bought this to be able to teach scouts outdoors and not have to worry about lugging a large flip chart in to the field. It works perfectly. I am able to print my presentations and note pages and facilitate dynamic training sessions in an ideal environment.
3,Cool case-little pricey,"Very cool case, plenty of room for a stage set and a mic, need to add some felt packing so the harps don't slide. The cost is a little high."
1,This is NOT the 1991 Hired To Kill!!!!,The write up on the film and the picture (which FINALLY showed up after purchase) are for 2 entirely different films. The one that I thought I was buying based on the words and description is a 5 star film with Brian Thompson. The film that was actually being sold is a 0 stars rating and GARBAGE!!!!Barbara Lee Alexander is not even in this film. This product was plagued by the missing image in the first window when it was going to be released. My mistake was buying it before the image finally appeared recently.I wish they would release pre-orders with the requirement of having the actual product pictured accurately BEFORE you can pre-order. I'm seeing this trend more and more.
3,Don't bother,"If you want this because of the word ""bacon"" don't bother. There isn't enough bacon flavor in there to taste (I could smell it a little) It's fine as far as Easy Mac goes, just not bacon-y enough."
1,Great when it works but useless when it doesn't,I bought this printer to print work documents as well as pictures. At first it worked fairly well. Not top quality photos but colorful and alright. After I replaced the color ink cartridges the color stopped working. The test print page shows color but the pictures and my reports come out in a grainy black and white page. I am very dissapointed and even more dissapointed when I got no help from the company.
1,"Prints looks amazing!, that is until the printer stops working :(","I got this printer for free when I bought my mac, not that it really matters since I've spent a fortune in ink. When my C84 worked, the prints were absolutely astonishing. Too bad it will cost you an arm and a leg to keep the nozzles clean. This printer should really sell for $1.50 since you're going to need the money for ink. I figured I would bite the bullet one evening and try to clean the heads. I finally got them working again after going through my new ink cartridges in their entirety. (they were full when I started). A day later, I couldn't print magenta. hours after that happened I couldn't print yellow. I've spent enough headache on this printer and can't wait to throw it in the trash to get something of quality. If you are looking for a printer that will save you money, please don't get this one. It's a trojan horse that will bleed you of your hard earned cash."
1,Got Ink?,"This thing WONT PRINT if ANY of your ink is out. It keeps telling you to buy more ink. If you're luck, you can get each ink cart. at $17 a piece + Shipping. Otherwise... $25+ at Best Buy, Target.. etc. I'd say go with something else.Not ONLY will it not print when one of four ink carts are out, but when you take out the carts-- THERE IS STILL A TON OF INK! You know how most printers will print until they die and they're printing out blanks but still trying? Not this one. Ink refils? They made it so the read on the cart. wont recognize it as full.I purchased a new full black in cartridge anyway--- put it in-- and now my printer says I'm out of color ink (I never use the colored ink. I'm always printing out papers in Black ink). Why do I need to buy more colored ink to print in black? Even if I tell my printer (via computer) to print in back and white. Why do I need blue, magenta, and pink? Geez* The thing is stupid.It's an ink conspiracy!"
1,Epson ink drinker printer,"My Epson CX84 is an ink drinker or you can say money eater!! Replaced with a proper Epson black ink last night, then the printer pretent normal, but print blank pages. Clean head, clean head and clean head ... still blank pages. After used up one other color ink, couldn't print and couldn't clean head. You need to a new color ink in order to continue. Put a new color ink then clean head, clean head... STILL blank pages. Eventually changed all color inks. Still print blank pages.. I owned this printer a little over a year, printed less than 300 pages, paid more than $100 for the ink. Then wasted more money for this cleaning heads... *?$%$#!!EPSON, I hope to see your company out of business!! You at least should pay me back for the ink I bought to debug your design flaw!!!"
4,Replace the printer not the ink,"So I have been using epson printers for several years now. I agree that the Epson Philosophy appears to be sell the printer at a minimum profit, and clean up on the ink sales. I do not do a great deal of printing. Maybe a half dozen photos a year, and occaisional text printing. For the price I am happy with the performance of both. As to the ink, I have found a solution that works for me. Ink lasts me 9 months to a year, and you are usually looking at 50-60 dollars to refill with Epson ink. When my last 2 printers have run out of ink, I find a newer model for sale re-furbished for usually about 40-50 dollars. I buy the re-furb which comes with new ink cartridges. I now get the benefit of newer technology, and new ink cartridges for the price of new ink. I can also sell the old printer for a couple bucks to help offset the cost. It helps combat the Epson ink price bite."
1,Expensive printer,"I print an average of 5-10 pages/month. Each time I have to clean the heads otherwise the print quality is low. This consumes a lot of ink. BTW, you can't clean the heads if one or more cartriges are low on ink and using the printer w/o one cartrige is not an option.Also, printing photo quality is not efficient.Overall, a low cost color printer is desirable."
1,Avoid the C84,It's a clogger and you will probably have to just throw it away within 2 years. Thanks Epson!
2,a real clogger,"First, I had Stylus C82 and it got clogged within 6 moths of purchase. Epson replaced it with new C84 ( 1 year warranty) and it worked pretty well for about a little over a year. Got clogged again and it is out of warranty so I'm out of luck."
1,short useful life,"I didn't get my printer free, so I'm really upset with this unit. Epson has done everything possible to make this one waste ink. I have extra ink cartridges, but now that the print head is clogged, I'll try and unload them on e-bay because I'll never buy Epson again."
1,1 star cuz it only worked thru one set of ink cartridges!!,"I purchased this in Feb 03 and it worked fine and the print quality was great. Ink ran out and I replaced. I noticed the one of the nozzles was clogged and so i run the nozzle check, which I believe run a small amount of ink thru to unclog. Long story short, just when it looked to be getting unclogged, I run out of ink!!!! I whipped thru the ink in less than 2 hours of nozzle checking! I looked online as well and it seems I'm not the only one that had nozzle problems. I've tossed this guy in the trash and purchased an HP 7550. It's older technology but at least it's proven and the reviews are good on amazon and CNET."
1,Don't Do It,"This printer lasted just over one year before all of the print heads clogged. Naturally, the warranty had just expired. I won't ever buy an Epson again. Quality has declined rapidly in recent years. Buyers beware of the new C86 printer as well. Same basic printer. Same basic problems."
2,Great until replacing cartridges,"The first moment after putting in the generic ink cartridge there was a message from the epson driver that the printout might be ""different' by not using genuine epson. Correct: the printouts became terrible, smearing, etc.I have used generic ink before, no problems.I just replaced the black ink again and this time also replaced the color ink carts. Of course I cleaned the heads several times and checked the alignment.This time the generic black ink prints perfectly, but the colors are almost non-existent. Hmm, I'm gonna buy some more generic color and maybe the second round will work."
4,Graphicdesignstudent,"This computer is a good deal,for doing the minimal stuff like priniting some from the internet ,spreadsheets,etc. If you want to see great pictures get a laser printer duh !!!or print them at a photography studio. How do you expect an ink jet printer to do that. My Ink lasted 4 monthes and proubly would off laster longer but i printed some graphics, so of course that took ink. its a good printer for you're home computer, nothing big like pictures."
2,Good While it Lasted,"I got the Epson C84 with my Macintosh four years ago, and it was a pretty good printer. Then it stopped working. No ink comes out when it prints even though there is ink in the cartridges. I suspect it's clogged. Cleaning with alcohol did not help. And, I've always used Epson brand cartriges. I plan to replace it with an HP."
2,Same problem - shortly after warranty expired - failed print head,"Same problem listed by others. Shortly after a year, the yellow just suddenly stopped working completely. No cleaning solution or similar remedies have worked. It printed great pictures UNTIL this happened."
2,"Produced nice printouts, until it broke down","Like many other reviewers, I was quite happy with my inexpensive C84 for about a year and a half, until the print heads got clogged with ink and failed. Both the black and yellow inks simply stopped printing one day, and no amount of cleaning or replacing cartridges helped. I finally contacted Epson support to see if there was anything else I could do, but repairs would have been more expensive than a new printer. Given the rather alarming number of folks who have had this problem, I'd say it's a design flaw. I replaced the C84 with an Epson CX4800--now I'm crossing my fingers and hoping for the best. In sum, stay away unless you can find an inexpensive unit and don't mind chucking it when it breaks down."
1,"Ink sucking, nozzle plugging JUNK!",This printer is designed to sell ink--it isn't good for much else. The nozzles plug frequently. It usually takes at least three cleaning cycles to unclug--which uses about 1/4 of the print cartridge ink. Ink cartridges are at least 1/2 full when the printer says they are empty and forces you to change them. My printer is now permanently plugged. The solution according to the Epson tech is to send it in to them for repair. I wouldn't waste my money to repair this piece of junk. AVOID EPSON!!!
1,Lasted less than a year,I can't remember when it started going bad but it was less than 1 year. I keep cleaning the heads and it works for about 10 pages then they need cleaning again. I print online postage and I am always worried because lines are going through the addresses and postal amounts. Bye Bye Epson.
2,Great while it lasted,"We bought one of these back in December of 2003 and were very happy with the the quality when printing out photos. Black only text also looked great when we started buying the nice paper. In June of 2004, it stopped printing the Magenta color so we had it replaced under warranty from Epson. The replacement worked great as well....until July of 2005. It again stopped printing Magenta. After running SEVERAL cleaning cycles and replacing all the ink cartridges, it still does not print Magenta which means everything we print looks blue/green. Not good for pictures of our new baby. Epson will not replace this one because their warranty only covers from one year of the date of original purchase. I would recommend this great little printer if you are ok with buying a new printer every year or buying an extended warranty."
2,Be very leery about Epson's C84,Like others...black ink ran out.. I changed the cartrige it wouldn't print black any more. Did all the steps recommended by Epson. Even reloaded the software...still no printing in black. Called Epson...don't waste your time!!!
2,Not grt for very sensitive people,"It is unscented like anouther reviewer said but, still naturally scented so that bothered me. It's also not clean rinsing so oily heads, it's not for- like mine. In my shampoo review I recommend anouther shampoo/conditioner which is much better. But this conditioner is okay for sensitive skin people."
1,not what i expected,"I was expecting country dance songs in thier entirety and by the original artists. It was a compliation of songs sung by other artists, not the originals, and they are badly blended in to sound like someone just changing channels on the radio. I was grateful to the seller for sending the item all the way from England, but disappointed when I broke open the package and played it. Better luck next time...."
1,It does not work with Windows XP!!!!,We tried to install this program on three different computer with windows xp - it does not work!
4,Nice Product,"The product arrived sooner then expected, and was well packaged. The quality is good, but the postage was almost as much as the product."
3,"Disappointing, but worth reading","I read Open Heart after having taken a course with AB Yehoshua and after having read Mr. Mani, A Late Divorce, and The Lover, and found it the least satisfactory of these four novels. (I would give the other 3 five stars.) I found the narrator annoying and his relationship with the fifty year old woman unconvincing. I think Yehoshua is brilliant at depicting all kinds of people except middle aged women, and I don't think he really understood how a woman would react under such circumstances. However, I loved the descriptions of India, and thought the prose style in general made the book worth reading."
4,Lund carrier,I used the carrier recently to bring our bikes to the Chicago Air Show and I was impressed with the quality and versatility of the carrier. I bought the bike carrier attachment and the rail attachment to get the most out of the carrier and I am very pleased with the Lund products.
1,a terrible product,"I buy products online frequently, and rarely leave a bad review. With that said, I have the Lund cargo carrier. It works fine. This attachment though is a complete waste of money. I have a road bike and a mountain bike. The attachment is not capable of providing any stability to either bike. Essentially, you put the bikes on and strap them down, and the straps provide the stability. With or without the bike attachment, the straps do all the work. Don't buy this, just use the cargo carrier."
2,Does not hold wheels snugly,Only the bottom third of the wheel rests in the bike carrier. This does not provide a lot of stability for the bike. I ended up mounting the bike carrier backwards (facing in board). This way the carrier supported the backside of the wheel. Recommend get nylon straps with a cinching mechanism to secure the bikes and prevent them from moving.
5,Heavenly!,"What a remarkable book! Every story has brought a tear to my eye. I could not put this book down once I started reading the beautifully written, heartfelt stories. The photos of the pets are a wonderful addition. The author's quotes and comments before each chapter add so much love and insight to the stories, they are truly God's messengers themselves! I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves animals."
