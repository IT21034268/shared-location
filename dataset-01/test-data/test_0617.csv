1,"Had to return it, not compatible with any OS > Windows ME","Don't have any real opinion of this game as it was sold under false pretenses, sent an inquiry to the seller prior to purchasing if it was compatible with Windows XP, the response was yes, but upon attempting to load the software and subsequently reading the 'compatible with', it was not able to operate in any environment greater than Windows ME, even when changing the properties to run under a kernel simulating Windows 95.It was very inexpensive, but eventually returned for a refund, it's too bad, as I was looking forward to this game as one of my preferred video machines at the casinos is the Monopoly games."
1,Monster Cable FM,This product tends to have a lot of static on most stations. I would not buy this product again.
5,Blackjack: A Morgan Horse,"Ellen Feld's captivating novel about a young girl and her passion for horses. This book has it all - the excitement of fulfilling one's dreams, and the reality of running into obstacles along the path to achievement. The author depicts an accurate account of the Morgan horse arena, while entertaining a wide audience with the story of a young girl's touching bond with a special horse. Recommended for young readers and adults, and is suitable for all levels and disciplines of horsemanship. A must-read novel for anyone with a passion for horses!"
3,Your books are okay for the little stuff! U-R-Not complete!,I have bought many of your books! But they need help. For instance Ranger 4x4 remove all the front axles! You have no lines to say how to get the passenger axle out of the PIG. You have 2 picture that you can look at but no INFO! Front axle 4x4. Some one should proof read step by step. It looks as if it was copied from incomplete information. Other then that your books not toooo bad. I preferred the old MOTOR repair manuals. Kinda like spending money on a book on fishing so you can go find a fisherman to correct what you just read! ( Get the picture )
2,very vague manual,Not much info in this book. Yes it contains some things but not a lot. It mostly has a lot of stuff about cats and dogs being attracted to antifreeze and thats bad. Yea I'd like to read about if I need o-ring seals on my exhaust valves and how to take intake exhaust combination manifolds apart instead. Will be used as bathroom reading material.
4,Well-made and great price,"This is a sturdy, well-made trowel. It feels good in your hand, and the handle is real wood. I got it for around $5, and it was completely worth it. I have not been able to find a trowel this quality for so cheap at any hardware store. I took off 1 star because it is not as sharp as I would have liked. It has stood up to heavy clay soils without any bending or wearing, so I am satisfied with it. This would be a great item to add for super saver shipping that you will actually get some use out of if you are an avid gardener, like myself."
4,Guidebook for the thinker.,"Do you think? Do you use your mind? Do you contemplate what is going on when you use your mind? Do you think about thought? Do you think about what you think? Then read this book... humor him with his criticism of other, less integral thinkers, and this book is an incredible view into our own thought patterns. Ken Wilber nails the human condition directly on the head with this book.Read it, and be happy; you are not alone in your head."
2,OK for beginers,"This book contains the basic information on 8051 but is not very well written and largely is just summary, without added explanation, of data sheets. A bit specific to phillips 8051 variants also.Somewhat too keen on TLA's ( three letter acronym's) I personally think saying CLM instead of click is just silly.Appendices only have title at start so are difficult to find quickly without using contents page."
4,Nice surprise,"I picked this CD up on a whim last week, and played the second track (""Queenie's Jam"") at a party I DJed on Saturday. The crowd really enjoyed it, as I had no less than 4 people come up to the booth to inquire about the artist."
5,waiting !!!,"Aw, come on , now !! One of the great films of the early thirties, and it is STILL not available of DVD ? Get with it, Paramount !!"
5,A SUPERB Manual of Basic Cell CultureTechnique,"I purchased this book a year ago to use in a clinical virology laboratory. Although many of the recipes used in my field are essentially set, this book allowed for broad learning in the skill of cell culture. I learned many principles of cell culture that were poorly explained or not mentioned in clinical literature and books.This book is well laid out, the chapters well written, and the information is comprehensive. Subjects include (besides the usual stuff of cell culture) chapters covering equipment materials, safety, contamination, scale up, a reagent appendix, and supplier's listing.This book is an excellent choice for the serious beginner. The expert will certainly find this book of value because even experts are only expert at what they do routinely and there is so much to know. This would be a great training source for research or clinical laboratories who perform cell culture."
3,good hypothesis...but,"Brian L Weiss has written a highly readable book that answers many questions about life. Or does it? He informs us that he is a well reputed psychiatrist who leads a patient back in time to remember her past lives. In between these lives, the ""masters"" speak to him, through his patient, in a different voice(male,of course). It's too bad that John Denver is no longer alive to play the lead role in the movie version. If the book has the effect of curing sick people, great going Dr Weiss.But if it has the effect of making us all think suffering is good for us, and then go out and make others suffer for their ""health"", watch out."
1,Hollywood next....,"The writer says he is very scientific and well educated, still he has a very sure knowledge of what a assistant in a hospital can know. He thinks she is non poetic, non thinking, has no knowledge about history etc, just because he can't get her to admit that she has read any books or had any education about history in her life. He constantly claims him self to be open still his driving all sessions to where he think he will gain personal advantage, i.e. his so called messages from the masters. THIS IS : an atempt to write a hollywood screen play for people who is desperatly looking for easy existenstial answers.(i wonder if Julia Roberts and Harrisson ford will accept the leading parts?)"
1,Give me a break!,"I find it dismaying that there are only 37 negative reviews. Those who have given glowing reviews must be people who are afraid of ambiguity, uncertainty and just not knowing what happens after death. This book has no more claim to ""certainty"" than many religious books. This psychiatrist's claims really tarnishes his professional creds. Don't waste your time. There are too many other books waiting to be read!"
3,Interesting,I felt this book was interesting however it was quite repetitive.. I am unsure what to make of his conversations with the main spirital being. Is it really that easy to get answers to all of our questions about life?
5,An Important Read for Me,This book was recommended to me by my physical therapist. I couldn't put it down and it gave me such an insight into my own belief system along with new concepts I learned and could honestly believe. It made a change in me in giving me a peace within myself. I would recommend this book as a read for anyone and everyone who reads with an open heart.
5,Makes the case for reincarnation,"I opened this book to ""peek"" at the beginning and before I knew it I had read the whole thing in a sitting. Fascinating story told simply and convincingly; you see the story unfold through his eyes. The words of the masters were profound and thought-provoking. I need a copy for my shelf!"
1,Drivel,This book wouldn't even make a good novel. I was disappointed because I wanted to be convinced of reincarnation. I wouldn't waste a nickel on it. I can't get rid of it and I've tried to give it away!
2,"Hello, my name is Bob and I am living in the year 100 BC.","Your name is Sucker and you are living now, but not very effectively.The author did nothing to generate alternative hypothesies for the apparent past lives. How about having heard about past lives and wanting to please the treating doctor? How about hypnotic suggestability? As for the Deep Truths revealed by the Master Spirits, they seemed to be just trite instructions to the effect that one should be nice to others and try to learn throughout life. Fun to read, but.The masters emphasise learning, which Weiss emphasises. I don't think that this is a coincidence.Weiss raves on about his scientific rigor, and then just about asks his subject to predict the future. He woke up the same time she woke up and concludes she is psychic. Scientific, like Paris Hilton."
3,Nothing Special,"I bought this book in a half-price bookstore to see what all the talk was about, and still can't figure out what's so special about this book.Maybe it would be interesting to someone who hasn't been introduced to the past-life/reincarnation thing yet, but to the rest of us it might just be a boring account of something we already know about or believe in.All in all. See if your local library has a copy before going out and buying it, and if you do decide to buy it, check out your local half-price bookstore first. (What's the point of paying full price for something if you can get it for half?)-AterPS: 'The Masters' were kind of annoying. Do they really think that 'second-hand' experiences give people much hope?"
5,Get the Book!,"I found this book in my time of need and it has changed my life. I am much calmer and worry less about life, which allows me to do positive things. It is easy to read and not tedious at all. Do something good for your self. Get the book."
3,This is actually an abridged CD,"The three star rating has to do with the fact that even though it was clearly marked as ""unabridged"", there are only two CD's with a total of 90 minutes of materials. I guess there is an error in the amazon's database. On the back of the CD jacket, it clearly marked that it is an abridged reading, but you can't tell from the front and the title listed on amazon is misleading. The other reason I put a three star is because the content, when cut down to 90 minutes, seems too rushed; unless you already read the book, it leaves you feeling a bit unfinished. The CD focused on transcripts of several key regressions and some of the relevations from the ""masters"" but without the detail account, it seem one hardly had the chance to get a feel of the main chacaters in the story."
3,Entertaining But Questionable,"Why did she provide a B.C. year when asked what year it was? (Living at that time, one would not know that it was before the common year ""1""). How did she know her own eye color when asked to look at and describe herself while ""inside"" herself in a past life? These are just two of the questions that arose in my mind when reading the book, and the author never even recognized the issues on his own. I have serious doubts about the author's claim that before doing prenatal regressions on patients, he lacked belief in paranormal or supernatural phenomena. In addition, it seems likely that ""Catherine"" is a composite character, not a single individual. The book has a very serious credibility gap. Notwithstanding all that, the book is very entertaining, as perhaps some form of reincarnation is possible."
5,Great book,Great book for psychiatrists!!! I would recommend this to anybody going into this medical field or that is in this field already!!
5,also from bettylous husband,good reading after journey of souls but felt the author might have put some of his opinions/bias in relating the content.
3,Tom Brown's Field Guide,"Some helpful examples for starting fires, building lean too, etc. Way to much story telling for me. I just like the facts. I'm sorry I bought his collection without knowing about all the stories first. Oh well."
4,Good book for road trips,Son likes to read this when we go on road trips and right before he goes to sleep. The book has alot of interesting things to try. We enjoy trying and confirming some of the things the book mentions.
4,great for the price,I bought this table for my 3 year old twins and they love it I was able to put away some of there other toys and they play for hours on this table. It is thomas compatable although the smaller metal thomas trains do not fit on these tracks that was alittle dissapointing....Other than that its an EXCELLENT buy....
4,Great alternative to pricey other tables...,"I bought this for my 2 boys, ages 2 & 3. Bought it in April '05 and it's now Nov. '05 and doing well. I got this on sale at Toys R Us for $99--compare that to the ridiculously pricey Thomas and what a deal. It's held up well so far to my 2 rambunctious boys. I don't think the wooden train is stellar quality, but it's definitely worth it for the table alone. This is probably the only toy that my boys play with consistently. I would have given it 5 stars if it were compatible with Thomas playboards (it's not big enough for a thomas playboard--boo!). We buy our boys Thomas brand accessories (trains, buildings, etc.). I would really recommend this item!"
2,Sold a bill of goods and that's it....,"Very disappointed in Geoffrey, Inc. The manufacturer of this train set. Everything is in French!!!! All the names of everything is in French. I'm sure this would be helpful in Canada or France but this is the United States. Hospital, even in French is spelled wrong! All the directional arrows especially on the aiport do not point in the proper directions.The wooden track is missing a straight 4 inch piece that allows the curve to be constructed properly. Our box that was purchased and all it's contents was new and never opened.Very disappointed. Not a fun Christmas present when all this was discovered."
4,=D,As always I got a fast dilvery from amazon. The condition of this volume was perfect upon arrival and I think it is a decent anime.
4,Finally!,"I cant tell you how pleased I am that this collection is coming out! I have been trying for several years to replace my vinyl copy of just ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" with no success. I found the original in a cut out bin at a camera store when the own stopped carrying records back in the 60's. It has a flaw on the first band of the ""b"" side, but it is still quite valuable(yes I still have it, and have no intention of parting with it. Thank you for releasing even this portion of a great film score. Any chance that the full score will be reissued on CD??"
2,A big lump of coal in Sam's stocking!,"I hate to be the skunk at the Christmas party, but I just don't get all these 5 star reviews. I had never heard of Sam Harris and really took a chance based on all these glowing reviews and the comparison to Linda Eder's Christmas album which is one of the best I've ever heard. While he does have an excellent voice, there are just too many things wrong. First, the sound on the CD is muddy and poorly engineered. Second, there are too many original Christmas songs (4 out of 11)written by the artist and they are horrible. Finally, the instruments are all played by one person and the music sounds cheesy like cocktail lounge music. All-in-all you'd do better to try some of the old classic Christmas CDs and leave this one alone. If you want to hear a great modern CD try Michael Crawford's Christmas CD!"
2,Not so good grip,I purchased this for my husband who had a stroke and the use of only one hand. He has great difficulty buttoning shirt collars. I thought this would be helpful. The first time he tried to use it the wire popped out of the handle. I super glued it back in but I don't think it has helped him much.
4,Up there with Austin,"I love Eliza Haywood and only wish I could get all of her novels that are out of print. Eliza's novels are absolutely wonderful. Her characters are real people with real vices and good intentions. Her plots a completely twisty and surprising. This one is not her best, but if you love the genre, you will love this book also."
3,Good CD but not their best,"After reading all the reviews about The Crypt, I fully expected to love this album when I received it. However, after giving it a few listens, it leaves a lot to be desired.It has a few good songs but many of them sound ""muddy"" with too much bass and not enough balance between the highs, lows and vocals. Some of the vocals are totally hard to hear and sung a little unevenly. In short, this CD doesn't sound like it was professionaly produced compared to Fear of a Red Planet and The Bitter End, which sound much better on my car stereo.By comparison, Fear of a Red Planet has some really good songs with good lyrics that you can sing along with. I've found songs from that CD get stuck in my head long after I've stopped listening to the music, which is an indicator of how good the CD is.So...I'd say this is a decent CD, but I think Red Planet and The Bitter End sound much more polished and complete by comparison."
2,Not enough information,"This video appears to be nothing but an advertisement for stent surgery for TAA's. Stories about two men, no female patients. No patient with open heart surgery to repair aneurysm. Over priced and disappointing."
3,"a sweet, albeit implausible regency......","the story's premise-of a wonderful but tall and ungainly heroine who becomes a shy and reclusive young girls companion, then starts receiving anonymous love notes was interesting.Unfortunately, this sweet story was too filled with implausibilities to make it a five star book. Add to that was the fact the the hero/heroines romance seems only a sidebar to the reclusive sisters love story and you get a just average regency. Which is sad because I think much more could have been done with the genuinely nice lead characters. There is little romance in a book set on the most romantic day of the year.So, unless you can get it for free at a library, I would not suggest this book."
5,One of the Most Amazing Sweets cookbooks of all time,This is an amazing book... if you're french or miss the pastries and desserts from your last trip to Paris.. invest in this book... ! You can recreate the eclairs and financiers that you've been missing and dreaming about!!!
4,You get what you pay for,"Works as advertised. Haven't tested the S-video but no reason to believe it does not work. Notice that S-video cable is NOT included.Pros:Inexpensive for the functions it has.Can dock iPod with skin on. Mine is 30G video with iSkin, and I use the 60G video adapter.Comes with 5 dock adapters so can be used with all ipod models.Cons:Plastic is kinda cheap, and build quality is a little crappy, compared with the Kensington dock I got.There is noticable hissing when you forward/rewind if the volume is turned up, which is a bit disturbing.Get this if you need a dock that just works fine. But if don't care spending more money and do not use skin on your iPod, buy the better quality Kensington dock instead."
4,"""change of pace for our composer...David Arnold""","This latest venture from David Arnold has given the ""film-score-buff"" a change of pace, known for his past scores of action and adventure...this one has short cues, but with counterpoints that leave you satisfied...a few stand outs ~ ""JODY AND IVETTE"", beautifully done...""DRIVE BY"", gives the music collector their moneys worth.Hats off to ~ Nicholas Dodd (orchestration/conductor), Shirley Caesar (vocals) and Varese Sarabande for doing what they do best...give ""film-music-collectors"" something to sink their teeth into!Total Time: 41:09 on 19 Tracks ~ Varese Sarabande 302-066- 280-2 ~ (2001)"
2,No bad !!!,"I used with my ford ranger 1996, It fits perfectly, but I have some problems, when I parked my truck in the night, next day when I run I have felt blocked, may is another issue, but I am not sure....."
2,Alrighty Then...,"The whole idea of releasing just ONE episode for the price of $10 is outrageous. Then they try to make it seem worth your money by putting The Pilot on there as well. Ok then. Sounds like another way they're trying to make a buck off of one of the most widely successful sitcoms ever made. The least they could have done is put a bunch of making-of featurettes, gag reels and interviews with the cast on it! But obviously this is lacking the kind of stuff a real Friends fan is intrigued by! If it was $5 it might be worth it to see the 5 minutes extra footage on it. But then again maybe not.My second issue is what's the point of doing a review on something that you don't even like or watch just to express your hatred towards it? And better yet, post that review numerous times becuase we didn't think it was pathetic enough the FIRST time we read it. Grow up people. Write a review on something that you can be senseibly critical about."
1,"No, it's just bad","How anyone could describe this show in its last seven years as ""witty"" is completely beyond me. It was terrible in its death throes, how it could ever last 10 years (and achieve increasing popularity with its increasing intellectual offensiveness) is likewise beyond my grasp. This show is so pablum, so utterly mindless, and the finale matched it. It offered absolutely no surprises: wow, Ross and Rachel wound up together?!!! What a shock, no one saw that coming! Twins? How unrealistic (not the twins, but that no one knew) can you get? All I know is this show should have went out gracefully seven years ago, instead of becoming merely a steady $1M paycheck for the so-called ""actors"" who will find little or no work now that Friends is gone (does anyone expect ""Joey"" to last?)"
3,"good, but where's the insert?","I agree with most everything people are saying. Other than the general feeling that everything that happened was a little too... I don't know...EXPECTED, I came away with a general good feeling. (But couldn't we have a few surprises? I mean, this thing has been leaked forever!)However, am I the only one to get this crazy DVD and NOT receive an insert? Has this happened to anyone else? Am I just extremely unlucky? If the DVD just doesn't come with an insert at all, that seems like a huge judgement error on the part of the company!"
4,The One With The Tearjerker,"I have watched friends since it began. There is a reason why most shows are not watched it is because they suck! Friends won the peoples choice award and I wonder why, possibly because it rocks. It is the only show I ever watch. I have watched it all 10 years and have not missed one episode. People say I am obsessed and it is probably true. I have every episode on tape. Friends will never be forgotten, it has had many memorable moments, and will go down in history. Friends is still on and has better reviews than Seinfeld. For those of you who think Friends is overrated and sucks, you don't know what you are missing, and obviously don't have any clue what you are talking about and don't have any idea what good tv is. Since Friends is ending we are losing one of the best shows of all time!"
2,Special Features Not So Special,"I loved the series finale! That said, I agree that the DVD disappoints. The producers, creators, and writers spent 10 years focusing on and responding to audience reaction - what happened?!? The 10 Years of Beginnings would have gotten a better reaction from this audience if it had been the piece that aired prior to the finale instead of 10 years worth of opening credits!Actually, all of the DVDs in the Friends series have disappointed me with the lack of cast commentary/bloopers, etc. The Special Features on this limited edition DVD and all of the season DVDs could have been awesome instead of mediocre.But hey, I'm grateful to have the DVDs to relive those classic moments now that Friends has come to an end."
3,Clasp Doesn't Hold,"The watch is lovely, the price was great. The clasp does NOT hold. I didn't go to the trouble of returning the watch and will get the clasp adjusted somewhere along the way. The discount was probably worth the defect, but I wish it had come in perfect working order."
3,War Along the Mohawk,"Good short survey of the 1779 campaign against the Iroquois of the Mohawk valley and the Finger Lakes region in what is now upstate New York. Informative, although not a smooth read. I didn't like the font the publisher used, and that may be part of it. The maps were merely adequate.Evenhanded; pulls no punches about the often savage behavior of both the Iroquois warriors and the American troops. In one case the same incident was described twice within 5 pages; better editing would have caught that.Good on the complex and often changing alliances between the tribes, Americans, British, and Tories."
1,The worst computer book I've ever read,"This book was absolutely mediocre. It covered the instalation well enough, but after that, things went down hill. The book covered software, but didn't tell you anything about where, or how, to install the software (if it wasn't automatically done). Also, at one point, it tells you that you may have to recompile the Kernel, but leaves you clueless as how to do this. It also only covers the extreme basics of how to use the shell. Also, it talks about using different Window Managers, but leaves it to you, mostly, to find out how to install them! All in all, the only good thing about this book is that is comes with Red Hat Linux. And that's only version 5.0, not 5.2 that is now available. I do not recomend this book at all!!!"
2,"Not bad for beginners, but...","This book explains Linux in a very systematic, step-by-step manner, from installation to administrative tasks. However, there are some differences between the software on the disk and the text in the book. The downfall of presenting the material in such an ""idiot proof"" way is that there are no suggestions for troubleshooting - the text assumes that everything works from the initial install. Anyone with any Linux or UNIX experience at all might be better off seeking a more advanced book."
2,Up and running the FIRST TIME,The book got me up and running the first time. That also had alot to do with the RedHat install software. After that I found the book some what useful. I would have appreciated a listing of ALL the LINUX commands in one place included in the book. The Indexing is OK. The table of contents is a laid out very well and can send you where you need to go. This book is not for the computer newbie. I am glad I did purchase it. It is reasonably priced and does come with RedHat 5.0 and other software on the included CD.
3,Worth Considering,"""Teach Yourself Linux in 24 hours"" isn't the best Linux book on the market,but it's pretty darn good.I diligently completed each of the 24 lessons and feel it paid off well enough to justify the cost.However,the book is outdated."
4,Good value for first-timer,"This was the first Linux book that I bought, and I don't regret it. More info on LOADLIN and LILO, X-windows config, modules and processes, and LESS on text-editors, etc. would have helped me. Also more info on what the services acronyms are,so that you would know what to install, would help."
2,Cooler Pump,"The Pump is a great replacement to my original stock pump and seems to be doing a great job thus far. Now for the negative part, the part was delivered over a week past the expected arrival date(and yes I acounted for buiness days only). When I treid contacting the seller via phone I was put on hold never pick up after that. I then used the email, they had responded fairly quickly however only gave me a link to track my package. Bottomline great product poor service, if you have 3+ weeks to wait for the product it is worth the price."
2,Not for those that don't follow Calvinistic views,"While there is some decent information in this book, overall I was disappointed with it. While I don't agree with many views of those that push Dispensationalism, this book seems to spend too much time attempting to point out that Dispensationalists do not follow Calvinistic doctrine. It becomes clear that the writer is more of an arrogant Calvinist than someone who wants to present an objective perspective on Dispensationalism. Starts out decent, and then raises flags with it's agreement to strict Calvinistic doctrine."
3,OK but spout is not so good,"I like this product and use it outside. Overall it's nice, but the rubber head of the spout hardened after a season and no longer is useful. I had to take it off."
3,Not for the money...,Well balanced design but too expensive for a small plastic watering can. The spout coming from the bottom seems fragile so I hope it holds up over time.
5,A great and sad legacy,"Former BIG COUNTRY singer & songwriter Stuart Adamson moved from his native Scotland to Nashville to explore a new new musical outlook on life - a life which tragically ended with his suicide in December 2001.This is Stuart Adamson's final project, and what a thrill it is to listen to this wonderful recording. A pleasing mixture of Celtic folk and Nashville country, and two voices that harmonize quite well. The Raphaels could have really become a huge success if only Stuart Adamson could have recovered from his fatal depressions. Listening to his swan songs on this fine album reminds you again what a tragic loss to the worldwide music scene his passing really is."
3,It's a transplanter...,"The handle on mine is black, and the blade isn't as broad as it appears in the product image, it's actually quite narrow.Take care when digging in thick, heavy or wet soil as it can bend. This works best in loose soils.It has markings at 1"", 2"", 3"" and 4"".Mine is Made in Taiwan."
3,Textual Criticism,"Bart Ehrman is a biblical historian who posits that scribes' alterations to New Testament manuscripts reflect both human error and the influence of theology, culture, and politics. He explores the development of written scripture from the Greco-Roman era, the effect of inconsistencies on doctrine and later versions, and attempts to reconstruct original text. This was written with lay readers in mind rather than academics. And I would have rated it four stars if the author would stayed away from adding his own speculation. But it is a serious work that will open discussion on textual error again."
5,Finally - The Truth About the Bible,"Bart D. Ehrman is the leading biblical scholar of our time. Mr. Ehrman's thoroughness and thoughtfulness are bright rays of intellectual and scriptural light piercing the darkness surrounding biblical matters. Here's the bottom line - If your concept about what the bible is isn't enlightened by Ehrman's excellent scholarship, no matter what Pastor you have, you do not fully understand what you are reading in the bible. People would and should be horrified to know that their worship of the bible is based on unsupportable theological positions, because of how the bible was written and passed down. In very readable, clear terms Ehrman demystifies the process the bible went through to become what it is today. Ehrman has done the world a great service with this book and all his others as well. The paperback version also has a wonderful addendum with an interview with the author. [...]"
2,Good review website,I find Ehrman to be mixed with his opinion and truth. Most do not have enough background to separate his opinion from fact.There is a good review at [...]
3,The misquotes are minor.,"Bart Ehrman has made several lecture series for the Teaching Company. They are excellent. His recent book, ""Misquoting Jesus"" contains three or four changes between translations, made by scribes before the advent of the printing press. None of the changes are important to my faith and beliefs. He does point out there are 3000 to 4000 changes between texts. Most of them are very minor word changes or commas. I feel the book is a big todoo about nothing."
4,Recommended by a friend,I have only skimmed through this book and find it interesting already. A friend highly recommended it to me and I can see why.
4,Good reading - did not agree with the author's conclusion though.,"This is an interesting book. I enjoyed reading it. I almost didn't buy it because I was concerned that it might be too technical and above my head. The author has published a number of academic papers and books on the subject.However after reading the first few paragraphs I realized that my concerns were unfounded. The book was easy to follow and understand. I didn't particularly agree with the author's conclusion that the Bible contains errors, but enjoyed reading his perspective and point of view.I would recommend this book to anyone that is curious about the Bible and how the original texts were transferred to us. After reading this book I now want to read other books on the subject."
3,Misquoting Jesus,"Interesting title for a boring book. Let me save you the price of the book. There are two cases of words added to Jesus quotes and a few errors that were made by transcription. That's about it. The documintation is well done and the pace of the book is slow. I like the author and think he took a hand full of observations ans streached it into a book. ""Bible Errors"" would make an accurate title but not have the draw of Jesus name."
3,"It is not ""right"" to misquote Jesus","I think this man did a remarkable job with his research, but he is extremely repetitious. It is painful to keep finding the same information. He is daring in his writing and I think he is probably right about a great deal of it. I have shared his opinion for years."
1,Not what the book title seems to imply.,The explaination is not clear and some arguments are not logical. I think the author could not put aside his biased judgement when reviewing the Bible as an open minded person.
1,"Pure, Crap!",Don't waste you time or money on this. Take the time you have to pray for this man. He's as lost as goose down in a snow storm.
5,Bias Observation by me.,"One needs to know I am a captivated reader of Professor Ehrman so this is biased. Dr. Ehrman shows how the Bible is probably far from what it originally was intended and how it became what it is today. In it he tells of the early manuscripts and how scribes probably sometimes inadvertently and sometimes intentionally altered the early manuscripts. For those believers of an inerrant Bible written by a god, this book is probably not a good choice. Those of that persuasion will have to believe the god also had men nuance the subsequent changings after reading ""Misquoting the Bible."""
1,Faulty Conclusions,As a reactionary to strict biblical inerrancy by discovering inconsistency or flaws of Greek manuscripts Ehrman concluded the Bible is a very human book devoid of divine inspiration. This is like declaring genetics to be devoid of the virtue of maintaining species integrity when mutation is possible. Ehrman has thrown out the baby with the water. The fact that basic tenets of Christian faith are well preserved through the ages despite flaws in manuscripts is strong indication of divine inspiration. Good scrutiny of scripture integrity with faulty conclusions.
2,The problem with Ehrman,is the same problem with Christian fundamentalists ... they are extreme. Ehrman was a fundamentalist. He believed the Bible literally. Now he's a fundamentalist secularist. He believes nothing in the Bible ... or at least that nothing can be taken as truth. How both sides can be so certain of their position astounds me.
3,Too many moot points,There is a fundamental problem with this book that I don't see emphasized in the other reviews. Ehrman DOES NOT consistently tell you which alleged copyist errors made it into our modern Bibles. I would think that copyist errors that have been recognized and either noted or omitted from modern Bibles would be of interest only to academics. I wish Ehrman had focused only on the passages that are still in dispute. Including recognized errors may be mildly interesting to some but for me they only served as filler to pad his book.
3,Not sharp at all,"Mine came badly sharpened. The edge was dull and there was quite a bit of sprue (excess metal extending from the edge leftover from a shoddy sharpening job).Fortunately, I have some sharpening equipment, but the dramatic curve is hard to sharpen. I'm not sure if I will be able to make use of this tool."
5,Interstellar Hatred,"Limbonic Art is the closest you can get to the beyond without actually killing yorself - although it is certainly what every dedicated death worshipper should do... ""In the deep pitch black halls of darkness, the cruel high-council of evil demands self destruction""...Only then can the journey Limbonic Art intended for us, begin. It's all about letting go. And being a misanthropic necromancer, of course.Some of us actually feel this way."
1,Please do not buy this product through Amazon,I thought these people might be exaggerating a bit and the bike was such a great price. My bike arrived in a broken box with the bike center all scratched up and broken Styrofoam all around it. Like it was a return or something and the person just threw it back together. I didn't even take it out of the box. I am not paying one penny for it or anything with regards to it. I'm sending it back and if Amazon tries to have me pay a restocking fee or shipping then I will stick my credit card company on them and have them debate it with them. I also have photos as evidence. I'd rather pay $50. more and buy it from Sports Authority.
2,Never again....,"Never again will I buy any exercise equipment from Schwinn or Amazon. Bike showed up and the box was open. All the parts were there, however....it is very scratched. All the pretty plastic covers have scratches on them. Also, it makes noise after you have been on for about 15 minutes. Not happy at all. The bike sounds bad..but looks worse. I am actually ashamed of it when people come over. Amazon and Schwinn should be ashamed for knowingly sending products out like that!!! And from reading the other reviews, they know how bad these bikes are packed and sent."
4,Great bike for home use,"This bike is fantastic for home use. It is compact (fit through the 20"" doorway up to our finished attic) and virtually silent (noise is far quieter than your breathing will be!).Compared to a commercial bike that you might find in a Bally's, it does rock slightly when you are pedaling above 80 RPMs but it's totally acceptable and does not compramise the workout. It's probably just a function of the bike weighing 200 lbs. vs. 1000 lbs."
2,Lasted about a year.,"This was actually great while it lasted. I used it 4 or 5 times a week, and did 15-20 miles a day, sometimes more. It was very quiet. Eventually, it started displaying the dreaded E-2 error, and then that was it would display, and was then no longer usable."
1,Damaged and Returned,I purchased this bike from Mercantila because of the numerous reports of damage. Mercantilla chose Amazon to ship the bike. The bike was recieved with one end of the box open. The styrofoam packing was torn and crushed and in little pieces. The bike was damaged with scrathes and dents to the main part. UPS has picked up the bike for a damage claimBuyer beware
3,"""going no-where slacker score...doesn't cut it""","This is the only score by James L. Venable, if there is another it hasn't surfaced to my knowledge...the score is slightly better than the film, but not by much.Writer/director Kevin Smith once again comes up with a messy script, nothing about the story-line comes together...retarded and simply in bad taste...the score has twenty-eight cues going no-where, much like the screenplay.I'm being kind, when giving this three stars, more like two and a half...wish this composer would choose better projects to write for, but with a little luck, his next gig maybe ""The Mummy Returns Once Again""!Total Time: 39:58 on 28 Tracks ~ Varese Sarabande 302-066-277-2 ~ (2001)"
1,Don't waste your money,"I should have checked Amazon before purchasing this at my local garden store. I have a short handled version this style weeder and I was tired of bending over to weed. So I decided to try the long handled version. The handle seemed sturdy and I was aware that this is *not* a pry bar, despite the long handle. So I made every attempt to use it as a digger. I would attempt to push it into the ground along side the root of the weed, do the same on the other side and hopefully I could then use a small amount of forge to pry the weed out. Boy was I dumb! Despite taking care to not bend this item, it bend after the second use. The another annoying thing about it is that it has no cross piece that you can use to push it into the summer dry soil. You would be better off buying a long, thick, heavy metal pry bar of some sort to use. This weeder is horrible. I'll stick to the short version and a shovel."
5,Dandelion Weeder,"This is the greatest tool to remove those pesky dandelions. With the long handle, you can get enough force to get below the dandelion base and remove the whole plant. No more dandelions !"
4,"Nice Chairs for the Price, But Hard to Assemble","These chairs are extremely hard to put together. If you are not mechanically inclined you should avoid purchasing them. The problem is that the bolts often don't line up with the predetermined bolt holes. This was such a problem with one chair that I had to drill a hole myself to assemble it. Be sure to check all the seats thoroughly before assembly since the top of one of my chairs had a very small cut (which I didn't discover until after I put it together). Once assembled though, the chairs are very sturdy and well padded. They are definitely worth the (quite reasonable) asking price and are great for persons with the patience to assemble them."
3,Too narrative for an informative text,"While as a writing consultant and presenter, I do recommend many of the strategies mentioned in this book, I also find that a majority of my audiences (inservice teachers) admit that reading Lucy Calkins is difficult. Finding her important ideas is like looking for treasure without a map! What about clarity and conciseness? Despite the focus on story-telling, the book is worth reading - particularly if you enjoy Mitchner novels."
4,Worthwhile Read,"The Art of Teaching Writing by Lucy McCormick CalkinsI would reccomend this book to anyone who must assist a child in learning to write, escially teachers, but also parents who want to better assist thier children. Calkins keeps the focus in the ""why"" rather then simply the ""how"". She allows the reader to see the importance of each of the different strategies and methods and the skills that they produce. Throughout the book she inserts stories about students and even her own child to illustrate how the methods work and the benefits they can provide. Her inclusion of real-life occurances make the book very readable. While many books of this type end up with a text-book feel, simply relaying factual information, this book has a warmth to it which makes it feel more like a novel then a manuel for teaching writing. This book is worth buying, I know that I will turn to it in the future as both a teacher and a student reference"
4,The Art of Teaching and Writing,"In the book The Art of Teaching and Writing, Lucy McCormick Calkins discusses various types of ways on how to instruct children to write efficient papers. The techniques that she illustrates in her book mostly came from her original ideas. These effective ideas could be used while instructing children or when teacher workshops are set up. Calkins writing style was very easy to read. She sets various examples to help illustrate her teaching techniques. One issue that I had with this book was the fact that the topics were too broad. Another problem that I have is that this book is not appropriate for elementary teachers. It could possible be used for middle school students but it is more suitable for teachers who are instructing High School Students. Overall, I feel that this book was organized very well and was easy to read."
3,The Art of Teaching Writing- Review,"The Art of Teaching Writing by Luck McCormick Calkin is a book that would be great for new teachers. It is also for teachers who need to come out of their shell when they are writing. After reading this, you will get a feel of what good writing is. It makes a teacher want to get up and start writing with her class and teach the fundamentals that were in the book. In this book there is an ample book list, which is great for reading out loud and silently. Even though this book is wordy and lengthy, it is a good idea for a teacher to read before teacher writing."
2,Lasted 5 months then stopped working,"I don't think I used it more than 5-6 times in the 5 months I've had it, but now the tape deck spits it out or it'll play 5 seconds then go silent for 5 seconds, then come back in and out. I've since replaced it with another brand and I have not had any issues with it so I know the issue is not with the tape deck. The product is cheap, so you get what you pay for. The new one I have was $30-40 and you can tell just by holding the two it's not as cheaply made."
1,Does not work in a 2001 Lexus RX300,"When the casette is inserted into the player, it makes a bunch of clicking noises and then the cassette ejects automatically. Returned this item the next day."
1,Awful product,"This adapter is totally worthless. I bought it to avoid replacing my factory head unit with a new deck (w/aux input), and I was very disappointed. I returned the adapter and replaced my head unit. Good decision."
3,Inconsistent Performance,The product worked adequately in one of my cars but continued to make a loud clicking noise in another car.
5,excellent quality. Best of the bunch.,"This product works well, and sounds good. I compared it to the Coby CA-747, and Griffin DirectDeck (7256-DDECK). Both of those had *awful* sound quality. The philips adapter sounds good, about as good as one can expect going through the cassette head of the stereo system."
1,Don't buy from Bowster,"Purchased this item from Bowster. After a week it had not yet been sent, so I emailed to ask why. They were prompt, but revealed they actually didn't have it in stock. They could have told me this earlier, but chose not to bring it up until I actually complained that it was taking so long to ship. What a waste of time. Don't order from Bowster!"
1,Horrible,"The product came packaged nicely, I went out to the car popped the cassette in and plugged the aux jack to my phone. The sound coming through my stereo was complete garbage. It sounded muddy and staticky. Don't buy this product it's a complete waste of money."
1,worked for one day then stopped,worked for one day then stopped. unfortunate but maybe it would work in your car. Guess thats the risk you take at this price
3,Does not work in all cars,I drive a Saturn S1. This type product cannot work in this and probably more models of Saturn. You cannot incert it with the ignition off. When the ignition is on it will eject the cassett regardless of putting it in with the player on or off.
2,Got 6 Months Use....,"It worked well at first, but it always had a cheap look and feel about. It was light and noisy and the sticker was slapped on skewed with a big crease in it. Despite all that it worked well for about 6 months. The first symptoms of its terminal illness was just playing in the right speakers but quickly degraded to not working at all. Had I to do it over again I would look at a different brand. I replaced it with a Coby that ""feels"" higher quality."
4,"Quality cassette, thin cable","Cassette seems to be of solid construction. The product works like a charm under normal circumstances. However, the shielding on the audio cable is THIN. This means your cellphone signal etc. will cause unusual sounds occasionally when transmitting data. Retail packaging was in perfect condition, and shipped with care."
2,Worked great...for awhile.,"When I bought this product, I loved it. Sounded great, no problems, right? After a few months having the tape converter in my car, the sound from the tape started to get lower, and lower. Now when I pulled on the cord of the tape converter that's in the stereo, the volume would kick back up...for awhile. When the volume gets really low, I would pop out the converter from the tape player, and the radio would be BLASTING! Put the tape back in, and the volume would be extremely low. Now I know its not my mp3 player, since when I pulled on the cord to the converter, the volume would jump back up. This is the fourth time I replaced mine for the same reason.But this is the only converter that works without spitting the tape back out. Why can't they make something guarantee to work perfect...instead of these cheap o' products under $10? I would love pay $20 for one, if it promise to be the best...but good luck finding it."
2,Problems,I just got this and put it in my car hooked it up to my mp3 player and it would start to play and every 2 minutes the tape would just eject . It gets kind of annoying after awhile. Has anyone else had this problem? I guess that's what I get for buying something so cheap .
3,"Low cost, Great Sound, Problems with some cassette players","5 stars for sound quality, 1 star for it's ability to work in all models of cassette players...1st time playing, the sound quality was amazing. The 2nd time, the cassette player just kept ejecting this adapter. 10 tries, 10 ejections...Since this is a known problem (auto reverse conflict), I opened the case (per instructions in other Amazon reviews), and was able to get it working again by removing one of the gears. But the tradeoff was a change from noiseless to noisy operation...I put the gear back in, and pulled off a tiny black plastic triangle on the case that appears to jam one of the gears when you spin the gears in one (not both) direction. The adapter now plays (silently) ~ 50% of the time..."
2,Cheap.,It worked very well for about two weeks. It is starting to go out. I estimate it has two or three weeks of use left.
4,Excellent Product,"I have had no problems with this cassette adapter. I have read previous reviews that cited problems with background noise, but I found that if I turn the volume down on the radio and turn the volume up using the MP3 player that it reduces and/or eliminates the background noise. I much prefer this adapter over having to use an FM transmitter."
2,Philips PH-62050 CD-to-Cassette Converter,"I ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices (all had the same description and specs). It worked for about 2 weeks, and then quit. A friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette, which had come loose. Since then it has come loose twice more, so I just don't use it anymore. When it worked, it worked fine, but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution."
1,Unacceptable,"At today's level of technology, I thought some simple electronics like this from Philips should simply work without a glitch and provide beautiful sounds at this price. To my utmost frustration, it was rejected from a 2004 Lexus LS430, a 2003 Cadillac Escalade, a 2004 Infinit G35, and a sony portable audio system at home. (I've definitely inserted it the correct way. And the auto reverse feature tried it a couple times too in each car.) The only cassett player it stayed in is in a 1990 Dodge Caravan. Due to the poor stereo system, I was not able to evaluate the sound quality. I may have gotten a bad unit. But for something this simple, every unit should have worked. This is just unacceptable."
1,terrible audio quality,"This product is terrible. More specifically , it does work, it fits into a standard car tape player and plays music, but the sound is just terrible! I am not a music fanatic, and was trying to play normal pop/rock, nothing fancy, but the quality is so bad that it fails to meet my criteria for bearable even when driving.It might be inherent to this type of conversion (digital-audio) with such an interface, so I don't know how competing products out there fare."
5,I bought it a while back,And it's still working in great condition. Sound quality is very good. I tried to cheep $2 one's before. it's worth paying a little more for this one
5,Keds Women's Kate Stain Resistant Sneaker,Very satisfactory product; excellent price; very good delivery time.Couldn't be more satisfied.
5,love these shoes,I bought these because I couldnt get my size in the leather Champion style. However I got these and I love them. They give better support then the Champions but aren't as heavy as a regular running shoe and in my opinion look nicer than a running shoe. I wear them almost everyday.
1,Obscure Mob Stories,"May has compiled,not written, about a collection of the most obscure mobsters in the pantheon of mobdom.The writing is derivative, and mostly amateurish.The book is a waste of money and time."
1,WHAT A RIPOFF!,"The author has simply taken publicly available information off the Web and repackaged it for sale to unsuspecting saps. John Titor's story is evolving in the light of current events and therefore has quirks and side issues that cannot be captured in a book. It is an important story by a purported time traveler (NOT the author of this book) about the direction the United States is headed, with predictions of civil war beginning in 2004-2005 as the result of America turning into a police state, with global nuclear war in 2015. Although the truth of the story is yet to be determined, the early prediction of civil war will validate or invalidate it very soon. Interested potential readers would do far better to peruse the information available on the web, ..."
5,Early stirrings of world music,"I believe this recording was originally released (on Verve,a jazz label) about 1967. I heard it (in Detroit!)around 1968 at a time when I was just learning about rumba and salsa. I used to play it constantly to try to learn Patato's conga patterns. I still have an LP version that I listen to occasionally. I have heard (and met) Los Munequitos de Matanzas, and have heard much recorded rumba guaguanco, but I would have to say that this recording is one of the most important specimens of it ever recorded (in the Havana style): Arsenio, Patato, Cachao in their prime en la calle playing 'to conquer the universe...' The record is primarily distinctive in its genre for its melodies. Timeless, haunting and unforgettable! Extremely higly recommended."
2,very fragile,"After a months I used it, one day I had put it on the chair. Someday sits on that and the wire rip from one end!"
2,Stereo Headset adapter,"Its okay. Took an effort to put it on, after a week the cord pulled from the nokia plug side.Audio quality is pretty bad, it ruins volume control, so it is VERY loud, it disables the microphone, as I said feels very cheap and falls apart.You would say this was what I could've expected for the price, but I paid $20 for shipping!!"
2,Good coverage but *very* poorly edited.,"I find this book useful but I have to rate it unacceptable for all but the *very* determined reader. It is loaded with typographical errors rendering formulas wrong, numerical examples wrong, etc... Really infuriating and unacceptable. I sent e-mail to the publisher complaining and they said ""oh, the copy editor on that book quit."" No errata sheet available.Caveat emptor."
5,A warm & wonderful journey.....,"I laughed, often cried at every one of Carol's life stories. Her insecurities, her annoyances, her tender learnings, herloving and her being loved are so completely her own, and yet familiar. Her ""Bloody Duck"" incident touched a chord so true that we read it to brunch guests a few weeks ago, after which we spontaneously shared our own stories of love and forgiveness.I highly recommend ""Catching On"" for those who find loving another a worthy journey of the heart."
1,"Introduction is good, but...","The introduction is good, and shows some insight. But the rest of the book is a description of the minutia of her husbands love of fly fishing and her love of her husband. It lacks a story. I do not recommend it."
2,Song name???,"Does anyone know who sings the song at the very end of the movie? It's not on the soundtrack.The soundtrack wasn't that great, only 2-3 good songs."
2,SUMMER CATCH CD,THERE WERE SOME SONGS FROM THE MOVIE THAT WERE NOT ON THE CD. OF COURSE THEY WERE THE SONGS THAT I LIKED.
3,No score at all,"What??????? Not even one song of score by Geroge Fenton? Songs are okay, sometimes. But we would like music that is actually from the movie, not inspired by. Not worth getting if you are looking for score music."
2,Buy Any Other CM Album,"First off- the Crystal Method are brilliant. If I could describe this album in a word...""standard"". I had much greater expectations from this ground-breaking duo. Nothing struck me as new or innovative. Was a bit on the boring side at times and although I'm sure the folks at Nike are happy with it, it sounds pretty bland. It's not 'terrible'. Just too 'generic' sounding for a band with so much character."
1,"forget substance, there's not even style.","Honestly, I'd first like to say that amazon recommended it and I stupidly took the recommendation. I'll never do that again. Secondly, even though I freely admit to loathing cheesy romance novels such as this, this book is not even well written. Every few pages the author rehashed the same few paragraphs. I read the book, skipping paragraphs that looked familiar..I know I skipped at least 70 of its 333 pages. Perhaps Ms. Wilde was getting paid by the word. Surely that is the only excuse for such poor writing."
2,Not great,"The songs were okay and ""catchy"" however, there was no challenge. The songs just sing the multiplication tables in order and there is never an opportunity for the kids to have to figure out the problems for themselves."
5,AN AWESOME BOOK!!!,"THE FIRST TIME I READ THESE BOOK I FELT THE POWER AND THE ANOINTING OF THE HOLY GHOST, I CAN SAY NOW I CAN UNDERSTAND GOD AND HIS WILL FOR MY LIFE NOW..... A GREAT BOOK."
3,Beautiful score by John Williams,"I got the OST from one of my best friends yesterday.I listened to the music again and again, it seems brought me to the wild countryside of England.I almost lost in it and cannot come back.I would say this is the best score of John's early works.Love it so much, love it to death, not only the film, but also the great music.Jane Eyre, our Jane Eyre forever..."
5,5 stars all the way,"This Cd really shows how talented Kyle and miles really are. This Cd was recorded at Rock 105.3 a San Diego Radio Station, it was done with two acoustic guitars. If you listen to Longest Barrel Ride and Slightly Stoopid(self titled)CD's you will get a completly different feel. This Cd is more acoustic reggae feel to it. I love all three Cd's and I am anxiously awaiting the next Cd which I am told comes out in Summer of 2002. If you get a chance to see a Slightly Stoopid show you will not regret it. What an experience they provide."
1,Good Product - BAD BAD Supplier/Shipper,"DO NOT purchase this product if shoplet.com is the supplier. They ship out in the thin box intended for store display and you will receive a damaged product. Sure, you'll call and they'll give you an RA for return, but will never schedule the UPS pickup, so in frustration you end up paying to ship it back to them. Then they will refuse to receive the return because, get this, the package is damaged when it arrives at their site.The parts of this riser that weren't damaged appeared to be nice. The riser is adjustable so you can determine where you want it. Too bad the damage to mine was so visible, otherwise I might have kept it."
1,Fluffy,"On the plus side, this book was cheap and a quick read. However, I found very little tangible, useful information in it. Seemed to be mostly common sense stuff."
2,Cannot get past the first fight,"I know it must be me but I cannot get past the first battle. What am I doing wrong, cannot get the ships down. I loved the first Ty but I have tried and tried and cannot get any further. I would love to see what the game is about."
2,Anubian Lights - 'Outflight' (Crippled Dick Hot Wax) 2 1/2 stars,"Five track CD single that was put out around the same time as their 'Naz Bar' effort (see my review). Only two cuts here that are even worth having are ""Starvox"" (radio edit) and ""Babu's Kitchen"". Myself, I wouldn't pay more than - say $4 for this title. Basically, pretty much left-overs aimed toward completists and die-hards."
2,Disappointing.,"I thought this book would be entertaining, but turned out to be a big disappointment. Boring. Never finished reading it."
1,Doesn't hold up.,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. Despite being hand washed, the plastic inner cup came apart from the metal outer cup after just a few uses. It seems the glue wasn't strong enough. We thought it was a fluke and exchanged it for another one. Sadly, the same thing happened. We ended up getting a refund."
2,Nothing really distinctively Asian here.,"I could care less for any of these plays. The authors seem to try and create a new brand of Asian literature. With the plays that I've read here, I hope that won't happen. Some of them are badly written and the characters aren't all too complex. But, this book shouldn't be called ""Asian American Drama."" Because there isn't anything Asian about it, except that the plays were written by Asians. Aside note: David Henry Hwang writes, ""Frank Chin's play The Chicken Coop Chinaman was criticized for reinforcing stereotypes of broken-English-speaking Chinatown tour guides."" If you read Chickencoop Chinaman, there is no Chinatown tour guide! Anyway, If you want something distinctively Asian, you have to narrow it down somewhere. You can't make up something culturally phony like some of these authors."
1,Good service bad product,"The Company who sold the MASMT5 to me, were very good and did what they said they would do. But the product never worked from the day it arrived, however to be fair, I have never asked for a return, as it would cost more than worth, by the time I pay to have the item shipped back and than pay for the freight back."
4,Mark Farner Makes This CD Special,"There are a few very good Christmas songs on this CD, especially those by Styx and Survivor. But it's Mark Farner's beautiful and inspiring ""Mary (The Return From Calvary) that makes this CD special. I would recommend buying the CD just for this song alone. Truly inspirational!"
1,Waste of money.,"Never worked properly. Impossible to tare, can't switch from imperial to metric. All the scale does is turn itself off when you try to tare or switch measuring units. What a piece of junk."
1,Wanna be ripped off?,"This is the worst purchase I have made on amazon.com EVER! It is a pitty I bought this before there was a review to warn me. The booklet is a cheap pixelated piece of junk mail and the squawking cat that sings all the COVERS on the album sounds nothing like, Kate Bush, Joni Mitchell or Tracy Chapman. The back up music isn't true to the songs either AND there is even a mistake whith the tracks where my copy had a doubled up on a song.Nowhere on the cheap box does it say that this is a cover album. Only buy this if you collect bad, pirated, asian imported ....VERY DISSAPOINTED amazon.com"
3,Not a comfortable watch to wear,"The watch keeps time well, but is too bulky to fit well under shirt cuffs and the strap is far too thick and stiff. It is difficult to fit the strap through the retaining loops. It's an inexpensive watch, so I suppose it's no surprise it's a cheap watch. It is rugged and accurate--that's almost all I care about. Because it is so much trouble to put on it lives mostly in my pocket, where it keeps time just as well as it would on my wrist. If it were less trouble to wear it would be a good cheap watch and I'd give it five stars."
3,Great watch for the price,"I looked all over the web and decided to buy this watch. No regrets. It's a great watch, especially at these prices.I looked at watches costing as much as $1,500, but nothing caught my eye the way the design of this watch does. Plus, it's a Timex. You get a lifetime battery warranty (the battery is actually only supposed to go 10 years, but you can take the watch to a Timex store and they'll replace it at no cost), great accuracy, and a day and date indicator.I recommended it."
2,Looks inexpensive and weighs a ton,"I'm not a watch connoisseur but own several. Up close, this watch looks inexpensive; it also weighs a ton. It's extremely shiny and the band looks like a thin, plated metal rather than stainless steel. The black face has a stylish look from afar, but the watch looks like a bad knock off in close proximity. Quality workmanship that I associate with the Pulsar brand influenced my purchase decision. However, this watch looks like it is of lower quality than the probably $75 Fossil watch that I received as a present. On appearance alone, I don't recommend this watch nor would I wear it in public."
3,Vendors try to get Dragon to stop at their booth!,"This game is really about making money. You could easily substitute the chips provided that represent Chinese currency and make it a real gamblers game at a 5 to 1 ratio between coins.The Dragon is moved about two sides of a city. It depends on cards played by players but it is also a guess as to where the Dragon may end up at the end of a round. You, as a player get a chance to place 3 vending stands along the parade route based on a previous dragon move, one at a turn, and attempt to get as close as possible to the final resting place of the Dragon.The final place determines how much money each player receives or does not receive. Typical materialist stuff but overall fun to play."
1,Returned this CD,I bought this CD by mistake and have returned it because this is not my type of music.
4,Its wonderful!,"It really twists your entire body , especially you feel it near the abs and the stomach! it's worth buying!"
1,Shame on So-Called 'scholars'....,"""The Church says the Earth is flat, but I know that it is round, for I have seen the shadow on the Moon, and I have more faith in a shadow than in the Church."" Ferdinand Magellan (Spring 1480 - April 27, 1521, Mactan Island, Cebu, Philippines)"
3,Slightly disappointing,"Although I mildly enjoyed ""The Magic of Provence,"" I felt that too much emphasis was given on certain, select topics, such as her friendship with the local nobility, and not quite enough to such things as the seasons, the surrounding country, and what (besides the *lavandin*) makes Provence so special, so unique. The recipes are good, the descriptions of her house beautiful, and the Aida story hilarious, but I felt that the entire work would have benefitted from some tightening up."
5,Love it!,This is a gorgeous ring! It really looks like the real thing. It was a little larger than I thought it would be but it looks great on my hand. It arrived in the cutest packaging that would be great if giving this as a gift. I will definitely buy from Gem Avenue again. The price was better than anything else I found anywhere.
5,Tells why Catholics Do that!,"Very informative in an interesting, easy to understand format.I am a cradle Catholic but myself had questions of ""why"". I found this book answered a lot of my questions."
5,A Jewel of a Book,"I loved this book so much that I have shared it with friends, including my pastor who found it true to the faith and exceptionally well written. I am a librarian and enjoy reading books on my faith. These books have been useful on specific subjects but did little to fill in those little holes that made me crazy but I never thought to ask about. This book caused me several times to say to myself, ""Ah, so that's what that's all about""! I attend mass at least five days a week, teach religious ed., and have served on parish council so I thought I knew everything. Boy, was I wrong and how fun to be set straight so gently. This is not a book to be gulped down in one mouthful; you'd choke on all the information, instead savor it chapter by chapter. I highly recommend this book to Catholics, practicing and non-practicing, and anybody who wants to learn more about the Church."
1,Look elsewhere for Catholic information,"Unfortunately this book is poorly written, highly biased, and inaccurate. I bought it to learn more about Roman Catholic practices, but it is very offensive to non-Catholics.There are a lot of accusations made toward historical Jews and Protestants - however, the author gives almost NO evidence to support his accusations. His footnotes are simply further accusations leveled against non-Catholics with no citations. Some of his accusations are simply incorrect, most are simplistic, and almost all serve best as mere opinion. It is fine for the author to lift up his religious ideas, and I have no problem with him disagreeing with beliefs that he does not share - but he offers no supporting evidence for his accusations and conclusions, and that is simply poor authorship. I would have thought that the publisher or editor would have made him back up his assertions. Makes me want to steer clear of them too."
2,A mixed blessing,"As a non-Catholic with a Catholic family, I hoped this book would be an objective presentation of the basis for Church tradition. I wanted to be informed without being lectured to.I tried to read this book a few times, but am always put off by the condescending little asides scattered throughout. While the book presents clear explanations of many things within Church tradition, the message is always, ""When you really think about it, the Church is perfect.""It's not one of those objective books that informs and allows readers to make of it what they will. Rather, it builds the case for the view that the Church is ""indefectible,"" as the author states in several places.I still use the book for quick reference, but only recommend it to people who are looking to justify the superiority of their faith."
3,Too many subplots spoil the main plot,The book was better than I expected but could have been tighter. The whole story about Eve and Tyler was unneccessary and distracting from the core stories of Maylene and Allison and the building of the Jade Palace.
4,So far so good...... it has a power switch?,"Well, so far this machine has been wokring for me. I'm about 220 lbs and have been running on it and it's still in one piece. I wish I would have gotten a model a little higher up but for the price this works great and is easy to fold up. I put it togeather myself but wish I had help getting the main part out of the box because it was a tad heavy. The assembly is pretty simple but I'm not sure about the directions. On the front of the treadmill there is a reset button and a power button. I thought the darn thing was broke because when I plugged it in it wasn't turning on. After some reasearch I read about a power switch located towards the bottom. Needless to say, I felt pretty stupid. All around, its a great machine for the price."
5,bowflex series 3 treadmill,"I looked in Consumer Reports for the best treadmill for my dollar and decided to buy this model. I absolutely love it! It was very well priced through Amazon.com and I thought the shipping was very fast.(About two weeks which is not much considering the weight). It is very heavy and well constructed. It does need to be put together, but I did it with my twelve year old daughter in about an hour with no difficulty. Everything is so well laid out for you, and the instructions were great! The treadmill is comparable to fitness center models! Very easy to operate. The folding is easy and it comes down very gently. I am very pleased with the Bowflex series 3 treadmill in every aspect and I thank Amazon for making it available for such a good price and free shipping to boot!"
3,Fun but short,"This game was fun, but it was way too short. I got it cause of all those TV spots I've been seeing on TV. It didn't really meet my expectations. We got over it in half a day and after that it was really like ok we're done. I wish I could've bought another game. I'm still looking for the best collection of micro games for Wii."
4,Fun game!!!,Very fun game.. keeps me laughing all the way!!! Graphic is really poor but its fun and thats what it counts!!!
2,Not a fan,"I got this without having smelled it before, which turned out to be a bad idea. I'm not going to try to describe the smell as that's pretty pointless to do. Words don't really convey smells very well, haha.I really like Man of Aran cologne a lot and I was hoping that this would be along those lines. It isn't really. I wouldn't recommend buying this smell unsmelled as I did."
2,Below expectations,"I bought this fry pan because it was deeper than most but was quickly disappointed in its performance.The bottom of the pan is thin and therefore heat distribution is uneven. Additionally, the non-stick surface dissipates quickly so don't expect much life out of this product."
1,Disappointing: Repeating the same idea all along,"This book could be half of its actual size. The author states his ideas in the first part and then just repeat them all along in the second part. For example, there are two chapters on extreme value theory, one in the first part and the other on the second part both telling basically the same story (and both very simplistic by the way). Perhaps he thinks that by repeating the ideas the reader would catch his message. The part of the book that it is not pure repetition waste space with the ""most famous operational losses"" with no further analysis but just stating them. There is also no indication on the author's bio whether he has any real-life experience in operational risk to write a book on the subject. Hence, his ideas to measure and model OR might just not work at all. The industry is still waiting for a good book in operational risk."
3,Slightly outdated basics,"These texts were written in 1978-86, and updated in 1999. Do not expect to find anything of the latests research here.My main concern is that the examples are not really about intelligence,they are general psychology, with very few examples directly relevant to intelligence.There are not revelations about secret war here, not even of old incidencies: the book was carefully screened by CIA before it was declassified.More modern books (and in freestyle, not in textbook format) with the same contents include:Massimi Piatelli-Palmarini: Inevitable illusions: How our mistakes of reason rule our minds (1994)Inevitable Illusions: How Mistakes of Reason Rule Our MindsCarol Tavris & Elliot Aronson: Mistakes were made (but not by me): Why we justify foolish beliefs, bad decisions and hurtful acts (2007)Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts"
5,A very good read for self-help analytical guide in any corner of intelligence studies,An excellent composition of non-fiction information. It presents very good details about the foreign policy and current information. This book is a great read for the layman and the global security reader.Author of THE SHEQEL
1,A complete WASTE OF MONEY,"My son got this as a Christmas gift and tore to box open because he was so excited. I can't believe what a complete waste of money this was. I couldn't believe it cost someone $40.00 to buy it for him. It went in the trash the very next day. The sides fell off, the top has no way of staying on and I can't believe the company would put a forty dollar pricetag on this. I've purchased better toys at the dollar store. I have never written a review on anything, but hopefully this will save someone else some money."
5,Hummzinger,Performs as advertised. Hummingbirds go to it. Ants and wasps etc. Stay away as long as you keep the exterior free of nectar.
4,"No more wasps, bees, or ants!","Definitely meets expectations...ended the bee/wasp/ant problem and the hummingbirds love it. Easy to clean, MUCH less messy to fill than the old feeder."
4,Outstanding,"Given that this was their first album, it's still a superb one. Maria's vocals are fully developed as displayed in her following two albums, but the band still brings the In This Moment feel to another level. Amazing lyrics, amazing songs, and above all, a beautiful album."
4,A New Dawn,"Metal Rock Music - whatever you want to call itthis band hit straight out the gate with a deep emotional gut wrentching laced album................its what the world was waiting for.........................and its just a start.......please believe me when i say that maria has been through alot, and it shows in her lyrics...............and as insurance that you understand and feel her, she comes thru with a band that supports her pain by making you feel her heartbeat........i had a chance to see them when they came to brooklyn in a small ""personal"" venue and wow i was blown away by their presence.......truly down to earth, this cd is worth spending some money for - from start to finish, no personal fav's only truly appreciate and love this album as a whole............"
5,Must buy!,Every song on this album rocks! It is hard to describe the music type... definitely hard core. Maybe Mushroomhead meets Kittie with a little bit of Iron Madenish riffs. If you are like me and like crazy screaming music with a little bit of actual singing you will love it!
4,"If you like In This Moment, this is a good CD","I bought this CD based on the song Beautiful Tragedy, but found there are other songs on here that I enjoyed as well. In This Moment is a great group but I'd have to say that the latest album ""Blood"" (in my opinion) is much better."
2,Not my Favorite MacDonald story,"I have read a lot of George MacDonald. His books vary in quality a great deal. Many people had recommended The Princess and Curdie to me, so I finally read it. This is not, in my opinion, one of his better fantasies. By far his best story, in my opinion, is the Light Princess (clever, playful, but also rich in symbolism and allegory, with characters that one comes to care about)."
4,Great for hall speakers,"I don't think these souls as good as my Phoenix Golds that I have in my den, but the price is right and they are perfect for the hall. They are perfectly fine for an ambient application. Also, the documentation on this and the Musica volume control is excellent. I got a great deal from amazon by combining the speaker with the volume control. Don't be affraid to buy Musica these products because there are no reviews; the quality is equivalent or better that other products in this price range."
4,A Newcomer's Guide to Writing Online,"I found this book to be extremely helpful. I think that Paul and Anthony Tedesco explain all the ins and outs of actually earning a living by writing for online markets in a way that is very easy for even the most inexperienced freelance writer (ie. ME) to understand. I especially appreciated all of the contact information for various online markets that they provide--so many ""writer's guide"" books stop after explaining HOW TO WRITE for the intended market and don't explain HOW TO FIND the intended market. The legal/contractual information and contacts they include are really valuable too--I could have jumped headlong into this writing arena without knowing my rights and been taken advantage of rather easily... Their conversational, quirky style also makes what might be intimidating to computer-insecure writers seem familiar and accessible, as do their down-to-earth reviews of the online markets. Best of all, they offer FREE market updates in a newsletter!"
4,Great Job!,I really enjoyed this book. Anyone that is even thinking about writing for the internet should check it out!
1,This book is out of date!,"This may have been a great source of info when it was written, but, as with life, the internet world has moved on. Many of the links simply do not exist any more. Even at a used price under $5, you will be better served just Googling what you want. Good luck.John"
2,Wont play on my machine,What a dissapointment that this Blu-Ray set wont play on my Pioneer (Model BDP-120) Blu-Ray disc player. All attempts to update the firmware have proven ineffective. Major Bummer!
5,COMPLETELY SATISFIED!,This miniseries is as close to being embedded with some of our military without the real gore. This war is not covered enough in our media to make people realize how horrific it is for the soldier's fighting it. The cinematography and acting is very realistic. It is a depiction everyone should be made aware of.
4,Generation kill from a veterans perspective.,"I was in Iraq in 2003 too, we even has some of these guys show up at our camp to get supplies.Excellent portrayal of reality 4/5. The only thing I disagree with was the poor portrayal of the officers.I spent eight years in the Marine Corps with five different units, I can honestly tell you that the great majority of officers I ever served with where excellent marines, very competitive, knowledgeable and they were good at what they did, I have nothing but respect for them, I myself was enlisted so this is an honest and unbiased opinion."
1,"Generation KILL - Trash it, Quick !","In my military veteran experience and in my opinion, I viewed only 2 episodes of the series, AND ""I TRASHED IT""... This movie was so full of CONTINUOUS, VERY VERY VERY VERY FILTHY LANGUAGE that I just couldn't take it anymore. I do not, ever, want any of my family seeing this material. I believe it also put a bad light on the United States Marine Corp. Therefore, I recommend ""NOT BUYING"" this series."
4,I got PTSD from watching this.,"Excellent series. All I have to say is this ""explicit"" gave me PTSD. In some scenes my heart was pounding and body trembling then I found myself right back in the sandbox which was about six years ago.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was too real. Brought back memories I'd rather not remember. I thought I was over this, thanks HBO."
4,Awesome Mini Series,"Loved it on HBO, loved the book, now I have the Blu Ray. I'm happy now. Wish there was a digital copy."
3,poor battery life,"I got this laptop for my son. He uses it very little on battery, but the battery went bad in about 11 months, which seem way too short a life. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about the same thing. Other than that it has performed OK, it is not a high end machine.I have had several Dell's in the last 10 years, both personal and business use and they have performed well. I currently have a 630 desktop and it is super fast - I have heard a lot of bad things about Dell customer service, but so far they have been OK when I have called them."
4,"I've had this computer for 9 months. I paid $700 for it on sale from Dell directly, free shipping and handling. Overall it works","I've had this computer for 9 months. I paid $700 for it on sale from Dell directly, free shipping and handling. Overall it works great and I've never had any OS or software issues. I use it for school and home only. I did elect to get XP instead of Vista because of all the problems I've heard about.I have three issues with the computer. It's heavy, I'm a girl but not a small girl and by the time I've gotten to class my shoulder hurts. The fan turns on after half and hour of the computer being on, and it always runs hot. Thirdly, the battery life does not last as long as dell said it does. It runs about two and a half hours.This is my second Dell and overall I'm quite happy with it and it works well for me. I can't say anything about customer service because I haven't had to call them."
2,Not as good as the origional.,"So Far, So Good...So What! (in it's origional form) used to conjure feeling. The remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just didn't quite hit the nail on the head. If you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s, get your hands on that version."
2,So Far So Good...So What Megadeth,"Not too fond of this one. Shoddy production. I feel either you like this album or you don't. I like ""Hook in Mouth"", the others I can take or leave. After the first two albums this one really slowed down. The album just doesn't do it for me. This one and ""United Abominations"", I haven't taken a liking to."
4,Cute Hallowen Story,I purchased this DVD for my grandson for Halloween. He enjoyed watching the movie as did I. It was entertaining.
2,Probably for older kids,"I though this movie would have more buddies in it and be funnier. We were so happy we had it in time for my son's birthday. It's always hard to find things that are for halloween but are not too scary. We turned it off after the first 15 minutes and even that was too much. The scary looking, glowing eyed, evil dog sucking in the puppies souls as payment for a portal to the underworld in order to unleash all the underworld creatures on Fernfield?! Totally have to shelve this one for awhile."
5,Awesome,My son and I love watching these cute lil puppies they are a lot of fun to watch and enjoyable for the whole family
5,Puppy's Rule,"This is the first movie in the buddy series that my 2 girls age 5 and 7 have seen. They love the puppies and their costumes. They also like to watch the additional features at the end where you get an inside look at one of the puppies houses. However, their are two parts that the kids did find scary. The very beginning of the movie when they ""trap"" the evil wizard and then again later on when he there is the final confrontation. All of the characters are dressed up in different costumes throughout the movie and the girls did not find those moments frightening at all. My 5 year old especially asks to watch it over and over. We will have to try the other buddy series now."
5,spooky buddies was a hit,I purchased Spooky Buddies for my 6 year old. She loved it. Very cute movie - even my 13 year old enjoyed it!
5,Spooky Buddies,"Very great movie. I now have the entire collection of the Buddies movies. Still working on the ""Buds"" collection though. Hopefully I'll soon get the entire double collection. They are the best and most fun movies about puppies that I have seen in a very long time. I think the entire collection is very, very good."
2,Not for small kids,My two year old twins loVe buddy and marly the puppy years. But lost interest in mins on this movie. Thankfully that was the case because I was about to turn it off. Too scary for small kids and hardly saw the puppies.
1,Not for the faint hearted.,This movie was a huge disappointment. Children aged 4 and 8 were so terrified by the soul-stealing character that we had to turn the movie off. What were the producers thinking??
5,Kyo Kara Maoh - God (?) Save Our King! (Vol. 1),This was a real good movie. I'd seen it once before it was made into a dvd and I loved it even then. I loved it so much I made plans on getting the dvd version so I could watch it over and over. The main character is so loveble I mean who wouldn't want to have this dvd and watch it over and over.
4,Needs more Slash.,"Alright...the first 2 episodes would throw any Yaoi Fan off - with that damn disguiting Queen shoving her sons in her giantic boobs (WTF?! The anime is supposed to be for a female audience!! Who the hell wants to see that??) but if you just ignore the first 2 and go to the last 3, it's a great anime. I love Wolfram's attitude toward Yuri dancing with a 7 year old girl and he is jealous. It's so sweet. There's lots of Bishonen and lovely slashy bits, but it is disappointing that it isn't Shonen Ai right now and still they shove in chicks to ruin good Yaoiful moments."
3,Disappointed,"Tabitha King has an excellent facility for prose and language, and a very intimate take on how the trailer class lives, but string a story together? I found myself painfully waiting to discern what exactly the plot line was other than estrangements and reunions between erotic interludes. Kissy is depicted as a ""strong"" character with every author's gimmick except a neon sign, but I'll be damned if I discovered anything about her motivations in the midst of her quirky and indecisive lifestyle. Or any other character's, for that matter, in this quirky and indecisive novel.Thank God it wasn't longer. I began slogging out of sheer determination around page 100."
3,Yes and No.....,Yes to the look yes to the color shade(if you're looking for red shoes) but no for the comfort level of the shoes. they were far from comfortable even when sitting down. there's a reason why they're $20.
5,IT IS DUBBED,"Despite what you may have heard,it will be DUBBED and subbed after contacting Pioneer animation/geneon they assured me this would be.This is the 10th installment of the great series!!A must have for fans of the series!!"
2,MJ,"I have installed outdoor lighting several times and thought I would like to add lights to my front porch. The box said easy to install. I bought two the first problem was the light and the connector was not in one of the boxes. When I called the company they were very ho-hum are you sure you bought it from us. It took several minutes to find the parts then she guess she'd mail it out at no charge. It will get to me in 10-14 DAYS. The connector is also the most difficult I have ever worked with. If this was someone's first attempt I can see why electricians get called so much. I will give it points for looks, they are very pretty but not much good if you can't or don't have the parts to get them up and running.I love Amazon and have never been dissatisfied with a purchase until now.MJ"
3,Not the Best Zorn,"Overall the tracks on this Film Works go beyond haunting into depression.It seems the compositions strive to be so, so esoteric, but mostly they just barely register a pulse. The music does sway from time to time, but slowly and darkly. ""Family Found"" is hinted at a on several tracks and there is some pipa-like cello plucking similar to some of Zorn's pipa-works. I like Zorn and most of the Film Works, and this one is okay, but not great. Baptiste, however, truly stands out on track 12, Voudoun."
1,Low Quality,Not really the quality you expect after all the adds on TV. Didn't get what I paid for but made overseas. Would not buy again.
5,This is what we miss....,"How nice to immerse oneself in the story of a man of character, a true hero. I found it to be a perfect antidote after reading the NY Times and Washington Post. What a salve in this age of cynicism, agnosticism and mediocrity."
4,"Excellent bio, but somewhat flawed","Robertson's intense, personal devotion to his subject is evident in this otherwise excellent bio of General Jackson, although the general's flaws are somewhat glossed over, particularly his unjust treatment of General Richard Brooke Garnett at Kernstown and the often-buried fact that Jackson had an illegitimate daughter. Still, an excellent account of the life and times of a Southern hero whose career ended tragically and much too soon."
4,i love broken yoke!,broken yoke is a rock band currently with 3 cds out with destiny being the second. these guys are great musicians as well as wonderful people. you can feel the music and cant help but to move to it. with each cd they keep gettin better and better! God bless!
2,Liked the other Sims better..........,"It was nice to play a different version of Sims, but I'm a die-hard fan of the Sims we all know and love. After playing this game, I went back to Sims Bustin Out. Urbz doesn't have much replay value. If they could make a PS2 version of Sims 2 for PC, then I would be in heaven. I love all of the Sims games, EXCEPT the Urbz."
3,"glad i played it, but it lacks a whole lot of something","This game has really nice graphics. I was really wowed by it, and the environments. the music is cool (typical Sim/gibberish style) and the environments are something worth seeing. If that's what you like to buy a game for, then Urbz is the game for you. But if you'd like to have a game with a good plot line, or something that shows you've come to the end of the game and achieved victory status, don't get this game. It is fun, but in the end, you feel kind of gipped out of your time and money. I'm sad because this game had the potential of being great, but the shortcomings outweighed any good this game had. If you can find it for real cheap, then buying it is a good idea. But don't spend anything higher than 15/20 dollars"
4,"Is really fun, graphics are awesome!","The game is really amazing, graphics, music, etc. the one problem is that it takes a while(perhaps 10 or 15 sec.) to load when going to place to place, but I like that, gives you a chance to rest your eyes. You can rent the game from places like blockbuster to figure out if you like it, thats what I did. But once you rent it about 9 times you might as well buy it.I like that there are differant jobs you can have and you dont just have one, like on the origanal sims for pc. It's really cool to change the urbz style! I think this a great game and sutible for kids/teens. I'm 13."
1,Loading,"I did not enjoy this game much. I never play it because it takes so long to load. You have closets in each of the neighborhoods and you are supposed to keep track of what kind of clothing is ""in"" in each particular area. For example, if you are in the skateboard neighborhood, you have to dress like them. BUT then the outfit you were just wearing is now in the skateboard closet so all your clothes get tracked everywhere, i have no idea how you are supposed to keep up with that. If you think of how a kid with divorced parents may have two rooms with all their stuff, but now multiply it times however many neighborhoods are in this game, all you are doing is changing clothes and waiting to reload the screen. For me, it was a total waste."
3,"Oh, Yuck",Little boys like this Yucky book.... Grown-ups do not...... Would get it again for younger boys who just adore grossing out the adults with this humor.
4,Great gift for a boy,"Buying gifts for boys ages 8 to 12 is difficult. This book is a great gift for a boy in that age group. I read it, too, and was interested in the information it contained - although it is kinda gross."
1,Ugh!!,"Seriously crap! I forced myself to watch 2 1/2 episodes before I couldn't take any more. This is cheesy and the plot is very superficial. I can't tell if the acting is also really terrible, or if it's just so badly written and directed it seems that way. I feel bad for the actors either way.I usually like shows like this, even ones that I'll admit are corny and low budget, but this is just the worst. There is nothing about this that redeems the God-awful plots. Just mind blowing how this could make it on TV, much less network TV! This would make SyFy ashamed!!Anyway, I never submit reviews, good or bad, but this show just has to be called out!! It's straight doo-doo!!!I can't believe they canceled Heroes and put on this garbage??!!"
2,"What it's got is OK, what it lacks is sorely missed.","Face it. You cannot have an overview of an entire genre of music written by a single author as opinionated as Smith. Apparently he believes that if he doesn't like something, it's not worth mentioning at all. Examples? The entire progressive rock output of a quite important contributor to the progressive rock movement: Italy. Not a word! Smith also feels that it's more important to talk about bands like Throbbing Gristle than mentioning bands like Van Der Graaf Generator and Gentle Giant. These are two of the most important groups of the genre behind the biggies (Yes, Crimson, Genesis). Smith oddly enough mentions bands influenced by these groups, but feels their influences are unworthy of mention. Rather than an overview of a genre, it's an overly opinionated guide to Bradley Smith's favorite bands and nothing more. I cannot recommend this book."
3,A work in progress,"Smith's guide to progressive rock music is a good start but far from complete. The book ignores the existence of bands he does not like: for this reason Gentle Giant, Van der Graaf Generator and most Continental European, Asian and South American prog is ignored. What is covered -- much of the British symphonic, space rock, experimental -- is done quite well. I believe if Mr. Smith were to expand his coverage in a future edition it would be worth five stars, but as it is it can serve only as a partial guide. Stick with the Macan and Martin books for now."
5,"Not excellent, but author is true prog rock nut! Buy it!","I must agree with previous reviewer: a few significan prog rock ""monsters"" were ignored. However, author says in the book that prog rock is such a vast area that cannot be covered by a single book.Besides, this book reflects the author's preferences, which I don't share completely.Anyway, I highly recommend this book as an addition to another books, for instance, Makan's work. You can find here deep reviews of 325 (!) prog rock releases!Besides, the author demonstrates such a deep knowledge of the subject that I must take my hat off! And, keep in mind the book was written and released before Internet era, so it's hard to belive how hard the author worked!"
3,Lacking In World Music Influences,"Not a bad guide, but sorely lacking in terms of covering the incredible influence of reggae, Brazilian and World music on progressive pop. I would also recommend ""Rough Guide to World Music"" and ""The Brazilian Sound"" to flesh out the library."
1,This seller is a thief,"I never recieved my item, although my credit card was charged. I recieved an email that my item was shipped and never heard anything again. I emailed the seller and they have refused to respond to me. Upon reading reviews I have learned I'm not the only one."
5,The complainers are crazy...,"All those bemoaning the remastered versions of these albums have lost their minds. The songs sound 100% better than they ever did. In fact if you want to hear how awful they sound in comparison, just listen to the four Randy Burns mixes at the end. These recordings show how the songs originally sounded and they are absolutely horrible. Dave included them for the sole purpose of letting people hear how much better the cleaned up versions sound."
1,Watch picture is deceiving,"I bought this watch because it appeared there was silver running down the middle of the leather band. When received, there is no silver or line down the middle of the band, it is where the two leather pieces come together. I was very disappointed as it clearly looks like a silver piece. Have to be careful with misleading advertising!"
3,The Jewels of Aptor,"""The Jewels of Aptor"" is probably the silliest entry in the post-apocalyptic genre that I've ever read. That's ok, I understand that not every science fiction author strives to create literary masterpieces as well. I can forgive the undeveloped characters and cliched dialogue (sample lines: ""Boy am I glad to see you."", ""Let's get out of here."") What I can't forgive is the fact that much of the novel doesn't really make sense. Especially at the end, it was hard to keep track of what was going on, and the sudden revelations about who's actually working for the side of good, who's a double-agent, etc..., fail to really explain all of the characters' behavior earlier in the book. Even so, ""The Jewels of Aptor"" does have enough fast-paced actions scenes to earn a three-star rating."
4,A good start for the curious,"A collection of ska - both from the ""first wave"" Jamaican sixties and ""second wave"" British eighties. You will find obvious hits like ""Israelites"" and ""Rudy A Message To You"" as well as hidden gems like ""Double Barrel"" or ""Skinhead Moonstomp"" or amusing covers like ""Guns of Navarone"" och ""Bonanza Ska"".The liner notes consist of a brief history of ska musik, but not much information about the songs, and that is a shame."
4,Adorable,"This Barbie is very special to me as my name is ROSELLA, she is beautiful, the grandkids all love her and the little raccoon is darling, except that one of them is a little deformed, I'll probably call about that."
4,Beautiful but Tail falls off & Panda does not sing,"I bought it for my 3 year old who adores Princess Ro so much. The doll is beautiful and the gown is cute. But I'm a little disappointed with the tail that falls off every now and then and according to description the red panda sings when Barbie hold it but it didn't do anything. For $12 I paid, although the Panda doesn't sing I think is reasonable. I just hope their description is more accurate other than that my little girl love this doll."
1,a shameless trick to get your money,A BOOK? IT'S A PAMPLET I've read term papers that were longer than this! USELESS NOT WORTH A DIME!
4,When money is tight this item is right!!,I usually go with the higher end effect pedal such as digitech but being out of a job and needing to rebuild my musical equipment collection after it was stolen. I was VERY happy with this item. I paid $15 for it and it was well worth it. The effect it's self isn't spectacular but its it rivals some $60 or even $80 dollar pedals I have used. For the price I give it five stars but as a musician I must look at the pedal it's self and not the price and in my opinion it's a pretty descent chorus pedal! I give it four stars and until I am working again I think I will be buying more of these cheap danelectro pedals to help me get the effects I need for the music I write.
5,"I know what you're thinking, but...","The Danelectro FAB series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals. Cheap. Mass-produced. Housed in a plastic casing. But the FAB series offers affordable effects ($15 to $20) at surprisingly good quality, and end up sounding as good as some pedals that cost 3 times more. If this pedal cost $50, I might gripe about how tight together the input/output/9V jacks are. I might also complain about the weird position of the Mix, Speed, and Depth controls on the top of the unit, or the small footswitch. But at this price, for it to sound THIS good, I can't complain at all.Don't expect the FAB series to be good at everything. But if there's and effect out there that you only use once in awhile (especially anything involving modulation or delay), the FAB series is going to do it well, and do it for a fraction of the cost of other pedals. It's just a great option to have for casual/budget guitarists."
3,Battery killer,"The pedal itself is well built and sturdy but the 9v battery you put inside the sucker will die very quickly although all the Fab pedals seem to do this, I wasn't even using mine and it killed the battery. The effect is ok but not anything I fell in love with but worth getting if you want a cheap thrill."
4,"Wierd, but pretty neat!","An experienced, very good baseball team made up of some kids finds themselves facing against a group of aliens! The kids think that winning will be no sweat, but boy are they wrong! This is the alien's first time playing baseball, but they sure are good! The kid's begin to think that there is no way they are going to win. By then, it is getting late and the aliens say they have to be getting home. Then the kids think up a very clever way of winning, but I'm not going to tell you how they won. Well, because they won, they win a ride in the alien's spaceship! This is an incredible, non-forgetable book! It is also very easy to read- I read it in about 40 minutes."
3,"The book's ok, but ""Bayview"" ain't that great...","If this were to be a truly honest account - as it claims to be - then it should have commented on the atrociously poor reputation that ""Bayview's"" surgery residency has across the nation. As a former surgery resident, I can comment with confidence on this point. To say that ""Bayview"" has one of the best surgery programs in the country is absolute fantasy! Teaching is poor and resident morale is abysmal. Murrah's success is probably mostly due to his personal strengths in spite of ""Bayview"" rather than because of it. True, ""Bayview"" surgery has a rich heritage, but its luster has faded in recent years. Other than these falsehoods, I found the book largely enjoyable."
1,This is toilet paper,"I found myself laughing at what amounts to a surgical resident with a godzilla ego. I can't believe that someone who is entrusted with protecting and saving lives can make such fun of the very people he is charged with helping. If I were one of these patients and read this scrambled mess, I would hire an attorney for slander and malpractice. I only hope that he never passed his boards and if he did, practices in a state far from mine....you're the type of ass that gives doctors a bad name."
3,1 of 2.,"This is a superb soundtrack, but it is one of two and quite frankly, the weaker of two. It's number two is THE ARCADE VERSION of itself. The game music is disjointed and choppy, but the arcade music flows like blood, this one flows more like puss. Before you buy this know the difference. I bought it back when it was $3.00 (sellers...shame on you) and I was expecting tracks I heard on [...], unknown to me those were the arcade versions. Boy, was I peeved when a soundtrack showed up sounding completely different. Still good, but notably the King and The Unknown's theme on the arcade version are singularly the best video game tracks I've ever heard, not including the classics, lol, but those tracks changed me after listening to them. Both can be sampled on [...]. I suggest you do so before paying the big bucks here."
1,wrong,No songs or tracks from the TV series. Just some pictures from the cast on the front and is really expensive. Save your money!
3,Royal Cash Register,"I was happy with the register itself. HOWEVER, when I ordered it I did so with the understanding it had a battery operation option as well as a plugged in option for powering it. It instead only has a battery back up in it for date/time and such. I was hoping to not have to use power to run it.Also still trying to figure out how to program some things into it. It will probably work fine for my farm shop once I figure out all the programing. Because of the power issue I am only able to have it in one spot in my shop."
5,A Coal Miners Bride,"This book is an amazing book. Out of all of the Dear America books I've read, this is by far the best one. It was so descriptive and it amazed at the things that Anetka did that my mom doesn't even do. I've read so many books, and this is my new favorite. Anetka is a strong, interesting girl!"
5,read this book,"Oh,it was so good. I'm going to read it once a year so i'll never forget this wounderful and great book."
5,My favorite book,"I read this book first in 6th grade and as an adult is still my favorte book. I reread it all the time, while it is a very easy read for adults its a very good story."
5,A POSITIVE UPLIFTING EXPERIENCE,THIS ALBUM WAS SOLID FROM START TO FINISH. IT IS A SHAME THESE GUYS BROKE UP. I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THERE PREVIOUS ALBUM CALLED THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE... CHANGES IS AN A+++ ALL THE WAY
4,Must Read,"Though this edition is not a great translation, the themes of the book still emerge and lay seeds of thought in the reader mind. If you have not read this book, you must. However, beware of the time commitment necessary for it is quite long and must be read as quickly as possible so as to not forget too much."
5,A uniquely compelling story with wonderful characters.,"Dostoevsky's perennial classic about a bizarre family of four brothers in pre-revolutionary Russia. Dostoevsky originally intended it as a book about children and their world, but it evolved into one of the most expansive books in Russian literature. It deals with nearly every aspect of pre-revolutionary Russian life: the courts, churches, social life, and most of all the attitudes and quirks of her people. Although it is filled with memorable adult characters, including perhaps the most obnoxious personage in literature in the person of Fyodor Karamazov, the children in the book are so well developed one can enter their peculiar world and be transported. Wonderful reading!"
1,A flop,"A Violetta that sounds like a cheap imitation of Callas, Cura sounding crude and Panerai way over the hill. There are much better Traviatas out there than this one."
1,Not good for Lancruisers,"I have a 1988 Landcruiser and am in the process of changing the water-pump so I bought the book by Chilton seeing as it ""claims "" to cover Landcruisers thru 1988. Well, I got into the job and it turns out that the Chilton book fails to accurately describe how to remove the water-pump. Specifically, the book fails to mention the need to remove various parts like one of the pulleys/pulley tensioner and bracket, and unbolt the AC compressor bracket from the engine so as to be able to remove the water-pump once it has been unbolted. It seems that in order to reduce costs and in an effort to ""appeal"" to more Toyota owners, Chilton has skimped on their research/detail in putting this repair manual together. I am a very dissatisfied customer! A word to the wise, look elsewhere for a competent repair manual"
5,GREAT MANUAL!,"This manual is outstanding and is quite detailed. While I would not call it a ""shop manual"", it DOES provide wonderful insight and help. I also purchased another Toyota manual from another publisher and between the two ~ I GET the job done!100% Happy!!"
2,For Game Fans Only,"Forty-five tracks in 63 minutes pretty much sums up this ""soundtrack."" There are many pleasant melodies on this CD although none last for much more than 60 seconds, which is both disappointing and unsatisfying. The cheap, synthesized music may be quite effective for a PlayStation, but sounds atrocious on a home stereo. This CD is probably great for game players who wish to relive their digital triumphs. For the rest of us, its not worth the effort."
5,I'm guessing Liberty City is New York,"The year is 1998 and Toni Cipriani has been laying low for a while now. Salvatore Leone requires his services and takes him under his wings, Toni must work his way to the top to become Capo. However, gangsters and other families stand in his path to the top."
3,Better on a bigger screen,"I picked up SA on PC and thought I'd give this a try. The story line is pretty good so far (I'm not that far yet), the controls can be a little ifey. You have to be looking direct at the person your're trying to lock onto or you'll miss the guy right in front of your face for the pimp behind him not even looking at you. I do think it would be eaiser to play this game on a bigger screen, but I haven't tried with my TV yet. All in all it's defenitly worth a look, it keeps the same intensity as the other GTA titles."
5,GTA again and again and again,These games never seem to get old although the storyline never really changes. This game is no exception. Graphics are some of the best on PSP.
2,Not very fun,"I would highly recommend you buyGrand Theft Auto Vice City Storiesinstead of this game.I have been a huge fan of the entire Grand Theft Auto series on PC, so I figured I should buy it to play on my new PSP as well.I was highly disappointed.Luckily, I also grabbedGrand Theft Auto Vice City Storieswhich was a LOT more fun.Enjoy!"
4,grand theft TO GO,"This game was the main reason I bought a PSP. And to be honest, it is worth every penny. The graphics aren't quite as detailed but still very impressive. The action feels just as gritty and real as on the big-brother consoles. Pretty cool storyline but there is an issue with repetition as far as the missions go. My only complaints are that the game freezes up sometimes, and that the pedestrians on the street don't talk as much junk as on the other versions.Still, get this game."
4,Here's what I think....,"This game is the whole reason why I bought the PSP slim. I played the PC version and could not stand looking at the screen longer than 15 minutes until I felt sick....motion sickness I guess. Playing it on the PSP eliminated that problem. It still amazes me to have all three islands on a small little handheld. The controls are better than expected. Unlike the PC, you've got the option and advantage of auto-aim. The only problem is, once you're done with the game, the PSP slim seemed to crash randomly. The only way to avoid this seemed to require loading another game...minor inconvenience. I still highly recommend this game to PSP ownerz. (Of course, this is the patched 2.6 fw version)"
4,GTA: LIBERTY CITY STORIES,"Just as good as the Vice City release for the PSP. Gampe-play is a crisper, with a great soundtrack much like the others."
3,"Good wallet, with one flaw","Bought this wallet a couple years ago. It has many slots and holds quite a bit for its size, but has one problem. The credit card I put in the lower right slot eventually will get worn and actually split lengthwise where the digits on your card are."
5,This is a grabber,"Like suspense, drama, the unknown. Take a trip through this book, Once Again. On the surface it is deceivingly simple but then... Wow... It pulls you in and takes you to the mysterious. Great book!!"
1,yawn yawn yawn,"My local bookstore had very limited guides for Georgia and Savannah so I bought this on the fly. Wish I'd leafed through it more. While I'm sure the book is fine for fairly conservative, middle-aged or elderly travelers, I knew I'd made a huge mistake when I read the strange ethnography of attending a drag show by Lady Chablis. It was as if they had no clue drag shows existed or that one might attend one and leave -- entertained.Since Chablis has become one of the city's leading attractions (due to Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) and she is a VERY talented performer, it's great that they included her show in the list of things to do while in Savannah. But the sort of shocked tone came through in other ways. I didn't trust the restaurant sugggestions or anything else.While this is certainly one sort of inside look at Savannah, there's a hipper, funkier Savannah they are unaware of or unwilling to acknowledge."
1,Buyer Beware ...,"As one reviewer put it, ""buyer beware"" when considering purchasing this volume. This book is superficial and fails to separate fact from fiction, Christian and Judaism from pagan influences. While the authors compiled a great deal of information, the research is not originally their own. A rather shallow piece of work if you are looking for some real meat for Biblical studies. There are several misconceptions that form the basis of much of the authors' explanations of Biblical holidays and how the practice would be relevant in our world today. This is a case of good intentions gone bad. Do your own research, you'll get much more information from more learned and experienced people for a much smaller price tag."
3,Homeschoolers be prepared...,"Many of the reviews for this book say it's wonderful for homeschoolers. Certainly, the wealth of information in it makes it a decent resource, but the problem I have is that the resources listed for the unit studies include books that are nearly impossible to find! Even amazon.com doesn't have many of them, and one that I searched for today doesn't come up in any search at all, although the author's other books do (and it was printed in 1992, not necessarily a 'vintage' book by any means). For example, for the Fruits unit study, our local library only had two of the books. Of course, you don't have to use all the resources listed, but I certainly want to use more than just two! Be prepared to spend a year just trying to find the resources necessary to actually do the unit studies! Glad I just bought the e-book and didn't spend a ton of money on the printed book."
3,You get what you pay for...,"Plain, cut mirror. This is not OEM Replacement. There isn't the thin plastic frame you see on the OEM mirror. It is literally like they used a cookie cutter on a mirror to punch out the approximate shape. It comes with double sided tape for affixing it to your housing. Good luck with that...PROS: CheapCONS: CheapA whole new power mirror is ~$33 on Amazon. Get it instead."
4,A mixed review,"If you have already purchased the 3-disc Japanese CD set from Chrono Trigger, don't spend the money - you already have 90% of this CD.If you never purchased the 3-disc set, but enjoyed the music from Chrono Trigger, BUY THIS CD! It has the best scores and one or two great arrangement versions!(And if you loved Chrono Trigger, you've got to buy the Chrono Cross game. It has F A R surpassed Chrono Trigger as my all-time favorite video game.)"
4,A book you will want to read over and over again.,"This book is one of my favorites because it really makes you think. Master of Mazes starts out with you, Lynn the Tristler (a tristler is one who looks for a vegetable called a tristle) finding your friend, a beast named Redfern who helps you find tristles. One day, Redfern chases a cart that is filled with tristles into the estate of the Master of Mazes. After he enters you are stuck outside until you sneak in when the cart comes out. Your friend is nowhere around. Now the rest is up to you. You may search for your friend by going into the manor house or search the grounds. After this, you will have to make decisions on every page, some of which will result in life or death as you brave perilous mazes, race down a hill on a bobsled and even outwit a nasty minotaur to find your friend."
3,Got my money's worth,"I bought 15 classics for $5. During Of Humnan Bondage, the dvd would ""freeze"" while the soundtrack played, then the film would run silently for a minute. Afterward the film coninued. This happened about every10 t0 15 minutes. Was it annoying? Of course. Did it ruin the film? Um. No. Did I mention I bought 15 classics for $5?"
4,Still wort it,"A couple of the movies had some viewing problems due to age, however I still enjoyed these classics. Great price. Would reccomend."
2,Fluff vs. Facts,"My roommate recently gave me a copy of this book and I wanted to give it back! Reese delivers the information in scenarios and homilies and its very difficult to seperate opinion and fact. Which is OK if you need a cheerleader but if you are a driven person who needs cold hard facts, up front and accessible then this book is NOT for you."
4,Quite Different Book - My Son Loves It,"After reading the book, you are left pondering what exactly has happened. I don't believe Courtney ran away because the children loved him exactly as he was. The parents were terribly judgemental but happily accepted Courtney's favors. Perhaps the authors point of the whole story is to get you thinking - did Courtney, who arrived with a trunk that appeared to have travelled the world, run off to some exotic destination? Or, did the ""old, mongrel dog"" just pass on? My 4 year old son and I prefer to believe that because he was old, he went on to doggie heaven. And when the children were lost at sea, Courtney was sent down as an angel from God to save them. This version warms our heart. (We're not at all religious but I do like to believe in miracles from God.) Whatever the author intended, my son loves this book! =)"
3,Bormioli Rocco Eclissi Clear Square Dessert Plates,"First I would like to say I LOVE the style of these plates! They are good quality except for the fact that a few of mine arrived with tiny chips on them. I am not an extremely particular person but I do expect for something to look new when I purchase it as a new item, especially something that will deteriorate quickly once it's damaged. The damage is obviously not from shipping and I would like to request the factory inspects the dishes more closely before packaging them. My dishes also came VERY soiled from some sort of liquid substance that left spots that I am having to spend quite some time polishing off. I also ordered the dinner plates and medium sized bowls and had the same issue with these items as well. I hate to complain, however, I felt this need to be mentioned to whomever it may concern."
4,Not much new or humorous,"Most of this material was issued by the US Government with serious intentions. Although most of the instructions would not help a wombat survive a bee bee gun, they are instructional to a tiny bit. This is not one of the great video hits of the atomic city parade but it will do until the next one comes flying down the Amazon tube."
3,A Movie Full of Sexy Female Vampires,"In this very sexy and explicit movie, Wilhemena Van Helsing attempts to kill countess Dracula (Darien Kane). Countess Dracula can only survive by drinking the blood of female virgins. Having difficulty finding any virgins, she decides to try to attract lesbian girls to her crypt.Wilhemena is put under a spell by countess Dracula to find women to bring to her. Wilhemena is given a necklace that puts women in a trance. She uses this to lure the women to countess Dracula's crypt. However, Wilhemena wasn't really under a spell, and she attacks countess Dracula with a stake. Will countess Dracula die, or will Wilhemena fall under her spell as well?This is an extremely sexual movie, and is definitely not for younger viewers. There is very little plot, only a lot of female sex. There are some rather funny parts, though. Make sure to watch this movie when no young children are present."
3,Good,Not too bad of a movie. Bought it mainly cause I totally love Costas Mandylor. He plays an awesome bad guy.
4,Why we use it for a graduate class,"The one major strength of this book, from a computer science viewpoint, is its emphasis on ""attack patterns"". This systemization of these issues really differentiates this book from many of its competitors (which tend to be either the latest 500 hacks or descriptions of standards). Put simply CS is the study of algorithms, and this book fits nicely into that tradition."
3,..... A True TV classic,"Amazon have found this rare little gem on video- a true classic TV series. Sam Cade is a compilation of two different episodes from the 1971-72 Cades County series. Veteran actor Glenn Ford, stars as Sam Cade a modern day sheriff of Madrid county on the Mexican border who, races againgst time to track down hit men and prevent mob warfare as well as being pitted againgst his loyalities of an old war time buddy and old girlfriend.By todays standards, its pretty tame kick butt fayre but, it does provide for good afternoon entertainment.However, joining two original unassociated episodes, results in the video appearing too long and confusing to follow at times.Interestingly, this is the first time I have seen this series since its initial TV airing in 1972,and for that reason, for the astute collector of rare videos, this is a must!!"
4,The wonder nut of Shea,This is a great skin softener for your skin. I live in the desert and we are always dry. This Shea Butter from Amazon and Now foods is wonderful for just that reason.
4,effective product,"This is the first time I've tried shea butter. It's not as effortless as lotion but works much better. It has a consistancy of cold butter. As suggested in previous reviews, I whipped it in a separate bowl and put it back into the original container for use. With severe dry skin and eczema I'm always trying to find the ""perfect moisturizer"". This goes on light, absorbs well, and isn't scented. My hunt is finally over. My only complaint thus far would be the size of the container. It would be nice if it came in a larger size."
3,Problem with product consistency,"I have been using the shea butter for the past few months. It has been working great. I bought the first bottle in whole foods and the 2nd/3rd bottles from Amazon. The 3rd bottle arrived with melted oil floating on top. Also, the texture of 1st and 2nd bottles were very creamy and smooth. However, the 3rd bottle is not creamy at all. The entire bottle has this granule texture.. Don't feel good about the product consistency."
5,Best Korean Drama of 2010,Another cute and funny Korean Drama. If you loved Boys Over Flowers then you will not be disappointed with this one. Typical high school story of a girl crushing on the untouchable Goldenboy in school and goes through hell back with all the ridicule and teasing and meanness. But of course he's a sweetheart deep down. Can't wait to own it!
5,Book of Conquests,"This book was revolutionary when it hit the stands. It still is. Take a visionary artist like Jim Fitzpatrick (who is immersed in the styles of Mucha, Hal Foster, and the Book of Kells) and give him the chance to edit the Irish epic ""Lebor Gabala"" into a meaningful whole and you have one of the most dynamic synthesis of myth and image to emerge in the last half of the 20th century. It may be said that it is an ethnocentric project with an egocentric edge, but since that ""edge"" is competently rendered, then the project can be praised for it's daring. Bringing a myth into a new age is no small feat and to do so with such flair can only recommend itself to those who seek a Celtic Revival."
2,Not funny enough,"Nick Twist is an awkward teenage boy who moves with his mother and her loser boyfriend into a trailer park. He meets a pretty girl in the neighborhood with whom he falls in love. He creates a fictitious alter ego in order to become someone that he is not so that he can be with the girl he loves. Michael Cera is effective here as the virginal teenager, and there are moments of levity, but the film just is not as funny as it should have been. A fun movie to watch at times, but will be a disappointment for those expecting another ""Superbad""."
2,"Not A Bad Ass, Just Bad and Revolting","Youth in Revolt, not funny and not enjoyable and way too much Michael Cera talking to himself. A youth that comes from a divorced family, unemployed father who is dating a way younger girl, slutty mother that will settle for any guy that comes into her life and he happens to fall in love with a pretentious dreamer girl that wants him to do all sorts of stupid things to be together with her.This isn't much of a romantic comedy but more of a lets see how screwed up this kid really is. Especially when you find out he purposely creates an alter-ego to carry out his misdeeds or rebellious actions.The movie will definitely have a following as some sort of cult classic based on the acting and storyline for every white kid that comes from a broken family. This movie is not badass, its stupid!"
5,AwesOME!,Very cool movie lot of language at times not a child's movie but I do love the comedy.Has a great cast of actors that keep you laughing.
4,Yu Yu Recca-sho?,"I really, really liked Flame of Recca. It had all of the greatest genres: Romance, comedy, and action! It also had lovable characters--but I hate the similarity between Flame of Recca and Yu Yu Hakusho. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Yu Yu Hakusho, but I hate it when two great anime are similar; I like variety. Well anyway, Flame of Recca is about a highschooler named Recca Hanabishi. He has a strange idea of becoming a shinobi when he grows up. Along his journey he meets some iteresting characters...I think that Recca is just like Yusuke (yu yu hakusho)I think that Domon is just like Kuwabara (yyh)I think Yanagi is just like Keiko (yyh)I think Fuko is a bit like Botan (yyh)I think Tokiya is a mix of Hiei and Kurama (yyh)I think Koganei is like Koenma but he looks like Hiei (yyh)I would only watch FoR if you are interested in Yu Yu Hakusho and if you like Naruto! (Naruto-a manga about ninja) Oh and I think the manga of FoR is better! (please check the manga out!)"
3,K&N 33-2362 Air Filter,"Item well packaged and arrived on schedule. After installation, car engine revs a lot smoother at high rpms. Totally eliminated the high rpm shake felt inside the car that was present with the stock air filter. No other noticeable advantages noted. Same MPG. Same engine note. Installed on a 2010 Jeep Patriot 4x4 2.4L."
5,The Village People,"This brought back so many memories. It also made me get up and dance, excercise I badly needed. I enjoyed every minute of it."
4,I Love It.,"Just a must have for the your music collection. Good, cheesy fun. You just want dance and got the Castro."
1,The Human Race Will Thankfully Be Extinct Soon,"I thought the Village people should at least be campy, but when I actually listened to the songs they are so bad it makes me ashamed to be part of a culture where this band existed let alone was hugely popular. Species Deceases quickly!!!"
5,The finest Acappella version of Neil Young's classic.,"After many years of searching I finally found it! ""After The Gold Rush"" is simply the best. As a youngster I played the song on a radio station I was working for.. I received a 'gold record' for playing the song. I was one of the few DJ's who played it and put it on our 'hit' list. ""Prelude"" makes Acappella a thing of beauty. A must buy for anyone's collection."
4,Bruce Greenwood is my favorite.,Loved this movie! Bruce Greenwood and Emma Samms were great together. I could have done without the Simone/Brent shower scene but other than that it was a perfect rainy day romantic movie.
3,"Lots of fun, but don't expect too much","Anna Waldron takes the reader on a delightful romp through all the wonderful places that make Princeton such a special place. Anyone who has ever lived in Princeton--or dreamed of living in Princeton--will relish the references to local joints (I miss the Annex) and campus sights. This book definitely fell into the can't-put-it-down category for me.As addicting as it was to read, the murder-mystery plot is a bit predictable. I guessed the murderer rather early, and I never guess the murderers of well-crafted mysteries. One very implausible (though amusing) aspect of the book is how many parties the heroine attends. As a professor's wife (albeit, not a Princeton professor's wife), I can attest that the social lives of academics are not half as interesting as McLeod Dulaney's.Even so, I am glad I read it and will likely read more mysteries in the series when I am in the mood for some book candy."
4,"""GIMME THE RENT!""","Joe Pesci and Vincent Gardenia star in this 1991 comedy.A slumlord is sent to live in one of his tenaments he mustfix. This is one of Joe's best and I'm glad to have it ondvd that has good picture and sound, but only a trailer.I recommend this great comedy."
5,THE SUPER,"I am so happy to have this in my collection. I laugh everytime i watch this movie. I have watched this movie a lot, and laugh just as hard, as the first time i watched it."
3,Love Outward Hound,I love this company but the one of the bags I received this time did not hold up. Both pull tags on both sides of the bag came off. Very disappointing.
2,too much talking; not enough instruction,"I purchased this video hoping it would help me with my coaching of two youth league teams. One 10-11 year olds; the other 12-13 year olds. I've been coaching several years with good success and thought Mr. Wooden's video would heighten my knowledge of the game and game preparation. Frankly, I am dissapointed at the long-on-talk short-on-skills development contained in it. Mr. Wooden goes on for long sections discussing tiresome aspects of the game...and the excessive length makes it useless for kids. It strains my attention span. The drills are one or two-on one; if I do these drills, I have eight other kids standing around bored. Good man, dated video style. p.s. The coach of Duke University (Mike K) has an excellent vido out for teaching kids although I can't find it on Amazon and someone borrowed mine. Help if you know how I can get it."
2,I didn't care for it,"THIS BOOK IS FOR 5.0 AND NOT 5.5, I was disappointed. if you still use 5.0 it's OK, very basic. It's perfect for the user who is just starting out or, ""lost the user manual"""
5,Simply beautiful....,My only concern with this watch was would it be shiny enough. It looks a little dull in the pictures. When my wife opened it for her birthday I was so very pleasantly surprised. It is shiny to the perfect degree and not the least bit chromy. I really couldn't be happier and my wife loves it. It is a classically beautiful watch.
5,Excellent book by Leslie,"I enjoyed this book and followed the plan several years ago. What worked then is still helping today. Thanks, Leslie!"
3,good in the end,first order was not what was asked for but some kind of redirection in amazon went to a company who did send us the right mirror for the right car. all is well
2,Hoping for chipotle,"I've always trusted Lawry's for good and successful spice. I expected a robust chipotle taste before and after cooking. We marinated chicken for 45 minutes, well over the recommended time, then baked per instructions. The uncooked marinade has a very slight chipotle taste; the cooked marinade has no chipotle taste at all, overwhelmed by the taste of what may be cayenne. It's hard to tell - the taste is very metallic."
5,Puritan devotion to Christ at it's best.,"Puritan writers are known for thier marvellous logic and their thorough commitment to Jesus Christ. Thomas Watson has these qualities in common with those who were his contemporaries, however he injects into this book many poetical, descriptive and even romantic images that cause the deep truths he is presenting to rush home vividly to the mind and heart. Watson deals with many practical matters of Christianity and his effort is most helpful to those who yearn to be more godly and more honoring to Jesus Christ. The title should not put women off! It is a book that applies to both sexes. It seems the term ""man"" is generic. If you are serious about practical Christianity then this will be a challenge and a blessing."
2,not quite right,"The manikin i received was not the the one pictured. The skin tone was MUCH lighter, and the face was different. As an art student, I wanted to look at the different lighting, at various angles. (Real life models get bored just standing in one spot for hours at a time, sigh...)The hair itself was very thin, and began falling out the first day. For an artist, learning to draw hair, and make it look right, is a challenge by itself. The manikin is bit 'bleh' but it will have to do. Save your money, I'm sure there are better ones on the market. You get what you pay for, I didn't pay much, so I didn't get much."
5,"excellent, insightful book on Broadway producing","This is a remarkable book. I have read many books about the Broadway theatre world, but this is that rare book that combines extraordinary research and scholarship with vivid, involving prose and a truly insightful, erudite analysis of the elements that make up the Broadway producing world today. This kind of intelligent, scholarly book (without post-modern lingo) is a rarity these days. Adler's ability to conceptualize and analyze in a manner that is logical and clear is always engrossing. This is the perfect book for those who work in theatre, those who love theatre, and those who are studying theatre. A rare and remarkable achievement. I learned a tremendous amount about today's Broadway theatre world. This is the first book I have come across that truly explains all the elements that make up Broadway producing today."
1,Do NOT buy this product!,"This razor is fun to use. The grip and gliding action are cool. HOWEVER, the blades are merciless! I have never bled so much in my life! My bathroom sink looked like a murder scene! And my head was HORRIBLY IRRITATED! This was the absolute worst purchase of my life! Don't fall for the gimmick. Stick with a Gillette."
2,A Fun Gadget that's about it,"I had been shaving my head for over a year with a Gillette Fusion. A colleague suggested I try this guy. While it seems to be a quicker shave on account of it feeling safer I haven't been that happy. The shave isn't all the close and I have nicked the back of my head each time I've used it. I hadn't nicked my scalp at all previously.Its a nice gadget to have, but I have stopped using it. I would only recommend the HeadBlade if you're looking for something fun rather than an upgrade from your current razor."
3,The idea of running a toy car on your head.,"Great concept but not for everyone.Pros:It feels like running a toy car on your head.It shaves the frontal region of your head well.Cons:It does not shave well on the back of your scalp.If not careful, you will nick yourself behind the ears with the HeadBlade.You will need a separate razor to get all the fine grain that the HeadBlade leaves behind on the back of your scalp.You will need to take extra care (go very slow) while shaving the back of your head. The HeadBlade does not go over skin folds or skull dents well.Device is hard to clean."
1,HOLY MOLEY...STOP THE BLEEDING!,"Unbelievable how this product can get the positive reviews that it did, but everyone has a different head shape and hair type. Short and to the point, I looked like I was on the losing end of a knife fight. Many nicks and cuts and a nickel size gouge on the bump at the back of my head. If you still want to try this, have a stypic pencil on hand, you will need it."
5,I use a Headblade just about every day.,"I shave my head everyday, and I have been for about five years. The Dead blade makes it quick and easy to do. I use the AstraPlus blades in mine. This last one, I bought the finger loop is flexible, and makes it feel pretty good in the hand.I do fine that I end up replacing the shaver about every 18 months. I end up breaking the piece that holds the blades on. Other than that I am a completely satisfied."
2,Meh...,"Does the job, just, but more awkward than a conventional razor. Too fiddly. Also, four blades would make it more efficient. More design gimmick than anything else. Not really worth the price."
1,Headblade,Gave this to my husband as a x-mas gift along with the blades. He did not like them. It cut the heck out of his head.
3,the best way to shave your head,i recommend this product it feels right its easy to useand gets the job done
2,Seven years is too long...,"Just a word of warning: Anyone expecting T.R. Pearson's fabulously convoluted sentences is in for a shock. The sentences are simple and even sparse. While he retains his ability to set a scene, this one seemed plodding and lifeless to me. Perhaps it was the expectations attached to a seven-year wait, but Blue Ridge has too much Grisham and not enough T.R. -- let's hope he doesn't wait until 2007 to get back on track."
4,I love wahida's style of writing,"Initially I was bored with this book, so I put it down and read another. But when I started reading it again, Wahida didn't fail me. If your reading my review debating on picking up this book. Go ahead you won't be disappointed!"
5,This book is the bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is so good. The relationships in this book are juicy and good. But it was sad how the book ended.
5,This book is hot!!!,"Thugs and the Women Who Love Them was very good to the last word. Very realistic and gritty, with messages thrown in.I was very impressed that Wahida Clark wrote this book from prison, which should let anybody know that you can follow your dream no matter where you are or going.The three main characters in the book were females that were living the street life but at the same time trying to obtain a collgege degree and along the way came across some tough situations with the thugs in their life. Some situations came out bad and some situation came out good, you have to read the book to find out what was what.Later!!!"
4,GOOD BOOK,"THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK,ONLY DOWNFALL IS THE BOOK IS SHORT.THE BOOK IS ABOUT A FEW FRIENDS WHO IS DATING THUGSALL OF THEM LOVE THUGS, BUT ONE FRIEND HAS A SECRET THATSHE IS KEEPING FROM HER MAN, BUT WHEN THE SECRET COMESOUT SHE WILL NEED HER THUG MAN TO HELP HER, OTHER THAN THATTHE BOOK WILL LET YOU KNOW HOW THESE GIRLS DEAL WITH DATING ATHUGS, THIS IS A MUST BUY NICE READ"
1,Disappointing,"I was expecting a ""kit"" based on the title. It turned out to be a 210 page paper-back book. The main reason I bought the ""kit"" was to get sample contracts, but none were included. He does a decent job of describing the basic process, and good ideas on marketing. Overall, I'd look for a better source if you're planning to FSBO your home."
5,Great book,"In twisting the story to the Demon's point of view, Lewis gets the Christian message across in a funny, satirical way. This is a good read for anyone of the Christian faith, or C.S. Lewis fans. Witty and funny."
4,Makes you think,"Anything by C.S. Lewis is a good read, in my opinion. Interesting take from the perspective of the demonic side. Gives you plenty to think about. Don't make the mistake of considering this a total fiction story"
3,"Tiny, tiny type","Yikes. The type size was so tiny, I returned it and will try to find a different edition with normal size type. It wouldn't have been comfortable to read. I've bought hundreds of books on Amazon, and have never seen this. Hmmmm..."
4,Pretty Damn Good for an Indie!,"Wow! That is all I can say about this one...wow! I am usually not an indie horror fan but I was bribed into seeing this one and to my surprise, it was actually quite good. It has the gore, suspense, story, everything! I don't think you will be dissapointed by this one!"
1,Hair loss increased,"After reading in some forums that this product helped with hair loss, I'd say the opposite. When sitting anywhere and playing with hair id notice a lot of hair falling. The product claims a lot of things but didnt see any results. I went back to nioxin and my hair stopped falling."
2,"Too expensive for what it is supposed to do, but really does not do","This product is really too expensive. The price per ounce ratio for the shampoo is not realistic. Just because it is extremely costly, does not mean in is going to do the job."
2,Stopped working after one and a half months,"Up until today, I would've rated the watch with five stars, easily. Looks great, feels solid, feature packed, overall an excellent daily beater, BUT, the digital functions stopped working today and it's no longer switching between modes. While trying to get to the chronograph function, it simply gave a loud constant beep noise for about two minutes and now it's simply stuck in alarm mode. I've taken great care of this watch, and while not wearing it (mainly for office use) I store it in a watchbox with the rest of my watch collection (so it's not a question of abuse). Too bad too, I really liked this watch (so much, that I might even give it another shot considering the price). Oh well, Timex is known for reliability so maybe I was just unlucky, who knows."
3,TIMEX- KEEPS ON TICKING.....,"The watch is fine. Possibly a bit heavier than I had anticipated but you get used to it. The multiple functions are easier to use than older versions but for me, just as complicated. The leather strap is better than previous Timex watches. Overall I think it is an excellent value for the price!Mike Briggs"
5,Very good,"You won't go wrong with a Panasonic DV. I've had a few models. I have several of this model for my business. They're rock solid reliable, nice and small for portability, and the quality of the recording is very good."
1,Died after 3 months!,"This was my second camcorder- after a Canon that lasted 2 years but developed motor noise. This Panasonic literally suddenly died after only 3 MONTHS ( well, 3 months and a week- thereby a week too late for the warranty and a ""too bad, so sad"" response from panasonic!). I had used it to film a wedding- it had terrible indoor quality and poor sound quality and obviously had a short pathetic lifespan. Do not buy this camera!"
3,Be careful!,"I want to warn you that in the product descritpion saying""The PV-GS29 includes a DV output (firewire) for easy digital connection to compatible PCs or digital video editing equipmen"" is not true. The camcorder doesn't come with the firewire port, you need to buy it!!!"
1,Worst baseball book,"Wow, with all due respect to John Scherholz this book is just a waste of time....The number of contradictions and arrogant comments are just too much...."
3,good book,"the book beneath the ashes is about jessie arnold being framed for burning down the local pub, her house, and a couple other places that were linked to an arson murder 10 years ago. jessie tries to prove her innocence while looking for her missing friend ann holmon who is also a suspect in the arsons."
2,This set is junk,"I must have received a different set than the other reviewer because this set is what you'd expect to pick up a the big box store for $29.99. The aluminum cues are very thin, lightweight and cheap. It just has that junky feel to it. I try to buy nice quality items, but I made a mistake here. And the pucks are poorly put together plastic that survived today's games, but will not likely last for long. This is NOT a good quality set. If you play shuffleboard like I do and want a nice set don't wast your money on this."
5,A Radical Read,"Books on leadership development and organizational change are a dime a dozen. If you read only one this year, make it Radical Change, Radical Results. Ludeman and Erlandson are obviously highly experienced executive coaches who take us to the heart of the issues in organizations today with their intimate style, compelling coaching vignettes, and thought-provoking development models. This material makes a science out of what many of us intuit or experience in ourselves or our organizations all the time but don't know how to identify, much less address. This book gave me information and tools that I was immediately able to use personally and can clearly imagine applying on a larger scale in my organization."
4,Good big picture,This is a good big picture book. Additional reference books will be required to fully appreciate theory.
1,Not for me,"How can people read these kinds of books? It's like Allan Wright re-wrote the bible! If you want a book to put you asleep when you are wide awake, this is the book for you."
1,SHIPPING!,"I wanted to buy 6 pair of Labtec earphones because I think they are the best and I can't get them around here. Total, $30. Good price right! Well the shippihg is $30. as well. WHAT A RIP! For that they can keep them. Talk about highway robbery!!"
1,MexGrocer corn husks,"I read all the reviews before I bought the corn husks and it was all good reviews so I went ahead and orderd 3 packages. Big mistake the first package was all dirty with bugs, corn silk, and mold. I expect the package to have some corn silk and some (2 or 3 ) molded husks, but when I have to throw all 3 bags, away that makes me mad and I'm not going to return husks I already opend and tried to wash. So it was a big waste of my money and thoses of you who gave them a good review were either working for them, lieing or are lucky they got good husks."
5,Great Product,"This Hair care product is awesome...It Hydrates your hair like no other. As a matter of fact, it is the only Conditioner my wife will use. She makes me buy it for her even though it is rather expensive. I live to please her and I have Purology to thank..."
3,"same clips as her ""Ultimate Body"" dvd","I bought this because I have her workout dvd, ""Ultimate Body"" and LOVE it. However, this dvd had the exact same clips, not just the same moves, the same clips (just less of them). I highly recommend Meghan White's ""Ultimate Body"" dvd instead for these moves, plus arm, leg, and cardio exercise routines."
5,Excellent!,"Very good video - the exercises are clear and the sections are short but effective. Each segment is 8 or 9 minutes long so it's over before you know it, but you still get results because those few minutes are comprised of non-stop crunches."
4,Good abs dvd!,"I really feel the burn with these exercises. It's very short and too the point, but I feel like I truly worked my abs. The exercises are different than most and it's fun. My only problem with the dvd is that there isn't as much work on the obliques or lower half of the abs."
2,Boring at best,"These workouts are little more than crunches and reverse crunches. Maybe effective, but too uninspiring for me to ever put this dvd on. Also, there's very little instruction on good form. The kick boxing segment, as someone else noted, is all lying down. It's really no different from the bootcamp segment, except that you make a fist when you add arm movements. There's very little variation among any of the workouts, really, except to add weights. I found the instructor completely uninspiring. She seems to be trying to express enthusiasm, but it seems completely forced and comes off as just shouting. I really wish I had previewed this on netflix; I wouldn't have bought it."
3,Abs video,"Perfect AbsShort effective abdominal workouts. One error in the challenging abs section, she says left when she should have said right."
4,Great Game!,Great game! You can show off your knowledge of trivia or just bet on the player you think knows the answer. A round can be played in under fifteen minutes. It's a great conversation starter - we spread it out at our favorite Brooklyn bar and soon had everyone joining in.
5,Most Fun Party Game!,"This game was a HUGE hit over the holidays, especially at our big family reunion. The youngest was 16, the eldest 79; we all had a blast! Great, fun, entertaining game that is very easy to learn!"
5,Great game,This was pretty fun. The questions are impossibly hard but really it's all about wagers and approximation. Very enjoyable. Wish it included a larger number of question cards.
4,double the fun,"This is like a trivia game with the excitement of gambling. You learn some unusual facts from playing this game. It comes with little erasable boards and markers; one of the markers was dried up. Once you think of an answer to the trivia qustions, you place your bet with poker chips. We bought this game to play on Thanksgiving and everyone really enjoyed it, so we bought 2 mores games as Christmas gifts."
3,OK but too complex,I bought this book to help me teach basic perspective to my drawing classes - a subject I've avoided myself through the years. I found it a challenge and a bit too complex for beginner drawing classes. then I realized - o - it's written by an architect. Duhhhh - it would be complex.
1,don't do it!,"This past Christmas we bought this hockey net for our 13 year old son. He used the net twice, by the second time the top crossbar split in at least two different places and the joints came apart even though they are screwed into place. He tried to use the net again and this time the plastic shattered .... Needless to say, the item is very poor quality and the net is now useless taking up space in the garage."
4,As good as current laser rangefinders get.,"The binoculars and excellent, but a notch below the ultravid. The rangefinder is good, but from my testing against the 1200, not really better. Light flat objects can be ranged up to 1000 yards, but darker objects loose the ability to be ranged around 500 yards."
3,Fun Mysteries,"Laura Childs' Tea Shop Mysteries are fun to read and ""Shades of Earl Grey"" was no exception. The characters are well-drawn and likeable. The settings and descriptions are colorful and easy to imagine. The plots require a bit of suspension of belief - mainly because of the coincidental aspect of certain events happening to the characters in quite the way they do. Nonetheless, The book is one I have recommended to friend - particularly those who also like tea. They remind me of an adult Nancy Drew series and I don't mean that in a negative way since I thoroughly enjoyed those books years ago."
3,Very cozy!,"I enjoyed this book more for the setting than for plot, which was very predictable (I had the suspect pegged from the outset). I am drawn to books that take place in the low country of South Carolina, and the author portrayed both the sights and the people in such a wonderful, charming and delightful manner."
2,"An unrealistic, unsatisfying mystery in an interesting setting","All the perfectly coiffed society people of Charleston and their antique shops and beautifully decorated boutiques and all. I put the book down and almost unwillingly picked it up again to find out whodunit, but by the end I didn't care, and the big denouement turned a formerly reasonable person into a snarling snake of a talking criminal who was going to confess all to the amateur sleuth and then just leave town? And what's with immobilizing a villain with _superglue_??! Sheesh. I enjoyed the tea shop setting, and enough scenes happened there to keep me hooked, but still I found this a silly and unsatisfying book. Plus, it needed basic copyediting. Sentence fragments. As if the publisher didn't care either."
3,A mild offering in an uneven series,"Again, I loved all of the atmosphere of Charleston -- I can't wait to visit! The plotting was a little better than in her second offering, but it's not the strong point here. This is more a book of Charleston than a mystery. It's an entertaining evening, nothing more."
2,Iffy,"Works with some valves but the tolerances are on the limit. It has to be screwed onto the presta valve first (taking care not to inadvertently tighten up the valve locknut) and then attached to the pump/inflator nozzle - pushing all the way on. On one bike, the rear could be inflated this way but the front refused - it appears the inflator was not pushing far enough on the valve to open it and enable compressed air to enter.With all this fiddling, it's possible to use this adaptor but it worked out easier and quicker just to change the heads round on the floor pump."
2,Get it at your local bike shop.,"This product is way overpriced. Every one of the bike shops where I live sell them for $1 each. This will not allow you to use a tire pressure gauge. It only helps when filling up the tires with air. Also, I find that the adapters in general are annoying--when you unscrew them, the adapter will often unscrew the stem too. Then you are left to screw the stem back in and pump up your tires again. The very best option is to buy a bike pump that is compatible with both Shrader and Presta style valves. I got a fairly nice one at Wal-mart for about $20."
2,I'm not sure if I'm broken or it is,"I can't get this device to make a good seal and actually work. It's likely that I'm just doing it wrong, but I have yet to get it to actually work.Maybe someone can give me some pointers? It just doesn't come anywhere close to sealing."
1,Poorly written,"I like Diana Palmer. I really do. But this was not a good read. The story line was fairly weak; almost too sentimental and very, very predictable. It read more like a disjointed soap opera than anything I've read in recent years. Sorry, Diana, but I know you really can do better!"
1,Not That Desperate!,"For SHAME Diana! I agree with the previouse reviewers (except Harriett), if you change the cover, you've got the same OLD story. I think what really upsets me is that I feel like Diana is stealing from me. Why did this book need to come out in hardcover? Did you think you were fooling us with the LARGE print and thick paper? This story was not worth the price and not worth waiting for. . . .and if a man calls me ""little one"" as many times as Cord did, I'd run screaming from the house. I still love Diana's previous work, but I think she needs to update the stories. If this were a paperback, then I'd give this book 3 1/2 stars. All in all, it's still an ok way to pass the time, but if you are a big-time reader of romance novels . . and a loyal fan of Ms. Palmer's, you won't find this to be one of her best works. Better luck next time, Diana!"
2,Entertainingly amusing,"A film for the gullible and for those who want to be persuaded into believing the diabolical 'End Times'.A film to be watched, not only by those who take the Bible literally but for the non religious as well. If you are an unbeliever, you will know how religion wants you to be damned, tortured and destroyed in the worst ways possible.A must for any who believes a tolerant and compassionate God does not exist and that heaven is reserved who places religious fervour above kindness and compassion."
5,Wonderful Book,"This is a great introductin to Chinese tea, its history and all of its incredible variety. I bought it in preparation for my first trip to China, and found it invaluable. I was not aware that there was much beyond black (red) tea, green tea and Jasmine. The depth of taste in puer (aged tea), ti guan yin (Iron Kuan Yin) and da hung bao (Great Red Robe) is amazing. It is like having a whole new world open up. This book should stay in print forever, it is a classic.By the way, if you do go to Beijing, go to Maliandao, the street of tea shops -- at least a thousand of them. What an experience! Sadly, the tea houses in Beijing have gotten so expensive that a cup of tea can run $200 - $1,000 in US money! But there are bargains on Maliandao. Just take your book with you. And enjoy! That, after all, is Cha Dao -- the Way of Tea."
5,Christas Jars/excellant read,"I found this book very easy to read, touching and very meaningful.I live in a our motorhome in a park in Florida during winter months and shared this book with about everyone on our street!Sent it to my daughter who has shared it with many.I have another book by the same author - love his writing! Several of us have actually started a ""Christmas Jar"" to be given to some needy person around the holiday - I had a friend who used this concept for her Sunday School lesson."
5,Christmas Jars,I love the book. Fort the past 4 years my Sunday School class has been giving Christmas Jars anonomously and including a copy of the Christmas Jars book with each jar given. It's a very heartwarming story.
5,Christmas Jars by Jason F. Wright,"This book was fantastic! It really makes you think about what is important in life, and that small things can make a huge difference in someone's life. I have recommended the book to several people already."
1,3m tegafoam 4x4,i feel very ripped off on this product. i have purchased this many times and payed only a few dollars per per 4x4 dressing. i assumed that i was buying an entire box of 5 and only recieved 1 inavidual pad instead. the description of this needs to be more clear.
3,Not for me,"This is a well-done program with nice visuals and easiy-to-follow cues from the instructor. I'm guessing that it's great for people who have been really active all their lives are are just getting a little inflexible due to age. I'm closing in on 60 and found this too difficult, so was not faithful in pursuing it as a regular form of exercise. I am unable to even partially perform many of the poses or stretches demostrated. Besides age, I have the added disadvantage of hip and knee joint pain as a side effect from a drug that I'm taking, and have not found this to improve my joint condition. I would like to see some unfit seniors working out with the instructor, just to see if it's really doable."
2,Are you kidding?,"I had high hopes for this dvd, and I was sorely disappointed. I'm giving it two stars because there is value in the material itself. Unfortunately, Maggie Rhoades' delivery is so ridiculously poor it overshadows everything else. Ever heard a second-grader read something with such a complete lack of fluency that you can't comprehend the sentence, even though you can understand each word? In a nutshell, that is Maggie Rhoades. Her pained grimace, her use of ridiculous jargon over simple language, the voiceovers that make parts of the video look like a dubbed foreign film, all make the dvd so irritating to try to follow as to be useless. Save your money."
4,pilates,"I have tried pilates for dummies and loved it, this cd is an extention of that video with more moves."
5,BEAUTIFUL REFERENCE BOOK,"I purchased this book as an aid in understanding the geography of the United States at different periods in history, and it has fulfilled my expectations perfectly. I am writing a biography and this has filled in my lack of knowledge of how people moved from one area to another in the past, when territories became states, the building of the first railroads, who the first nations were who settled the eastern seaboard, and many other details pertinent to my research."
4,they need to read it,..just wish he would read it now! It does no good for me to read it and badger him about all i discovered that could help him fight his addiction. He needs to realize he has a problem first and WANT to change!!
5,A GREAT INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO BY NOLAN RYAN & RANDY JOHNSON,This the best information I've received for teaching my athletes how to pitch with speed and accuracy. I was especially impressed with the professional quality of the video and the eavesdropping on Nolan Ryan as he offered his tips to Randy Johnson. Apparently they worked. I also liked the historial footage from Nolan Ryan's career. I encourage everyone to get this. Ryan will be enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1999. This stuff is priceless. Just ask Randy Johnson. END
4,The voice I don't know/but the book seller was excellent,"I bought this product for my invalid mother who was in the hospital and bored.I felt it would be a treat.When I listened to the tapes, I NEVER heard the powerful, booming voice of James Earl Jones. His voice is very distinctive and I never got on these tapes.When I read the box, it gave the name of some other person who was reading the Old testament and James Earl Jones reading the new. I have heard JEJ use a low, soft tone but even then you KNEW it was him. Even if this was him, I would have thought it would be more effective if he put more style and flair into the reading. The bible is a powerful book and should be recited that way. Soft where its soft, booming when a point is to be made. It would have worked for me, but I was sorely disappointed.In my opinion it was all the same voice, and certainly not that of the man I know.Please be advised this review is in no way agaisnt the seller. I received the package on time and in excellent order"
3,New Testament by James Earl Jones,"What a marvelous narrator! I wish I would have read the other reviews prior to purchase as I too was under the impression that this was the entire Bible, not just the NEW TESTAMENT. I would highly consider letting buyers know that even though it says Deluxe, it is referring to the lovely box it comes in. This is very deceptive. Now I have to spend another $41 to get the entire Bible. Please correct this if you value your feedback."
4,"Not the Bible, just the New Testament","When I search for ""The Bible"" on CD, and I find on title ""THE BIBLE"", I expect it to be the WHOLE Bible. Not just one part of it. ""James Earl Jones Reads the Bible"" It should say he reads the New Testament. Other than that, it is great. TRUTH in ADVERTISING!! Especially when it is the BIBLE!!"
5,Nice and Relaxing Way to Experience the Bible,"Vader reads the Bible, what could be better? In all seriousness, this is a nice and relaxing way to hear the Bible. It's definitely better to read the words for yourself, but not everybody enjoys reading. The music is pretty loud but it doesn't drown out his voice or anything. It's all instrumental. Go get it from a library if you feel like you're going to ""waste your money.""The value lies in the words being read. I would be interested in hearing what someone thinks of this if they've never heard these books of the Bible before. I've read them before but not in a while.Nice experience. Well worth the time."
1,Only the New Testament,When it said that it includes the entired New Testament. Dummy Me thought it would have the Old Testament with it. What is a bible if it doesn't have the Old Testament too. I was so excied to give this as a gift to a friend that can't read. He was just starting to get into religion. What a heartbreak!
3,KJV Bible,The CDs we're fine. However I thought the set included the old and new testaments. The ads to state only new testament included ; not includes new testaments.
3,stop the music,"James Earl Jones' wonderful reading of the new testament is totally obscured by the most banal background music imaginable. What a disappointment. In the first place, his voice needs no musical enhancement for such a signficant text. And if music were absolutely required it should be of a quality to match the words and the voice (Handel and Bach wrote some pretty decent stuff using this text as a theme.)"
5,Very clever,"The Solar Cat Book is a great introduction to solar energy using cats as a model system. Augustyn teaches us about solar energy and heat flow mechanics through a series of small stories and jokes. The illustrations and cartoons are not to be missed. Although one of the reviews suggests that children can read this book, I think that it is intended and is more appropriate for adults. It is really a shame that this book is out of print. I think that it should be revived!"
3,YOU CAN'T CHANGE WHAT'S MEANT TO BE!!,"i love sandra bullock she's such a great actress. so down to earth and she's real. many of her films are deep, hope floats and the lake house which was beautiful to name a couple. this one she acted well, the story was good, but there was something missing. it didn't grab me like the others. i got the movies lesson, it's never to late to change things, to hope, and to believe. it also gets across that you can't interfere with destiny. what's meant to be will be and it'll happen regardless. that's life, and you have to learn to move on what else is there to do. the movies not great, but it's not bad. i'd say give it a chance, starring sandra bullock it's kinda hard to go wrong."
4,Fractured Timeline Well Handled,"What makes Premonition work is its fractured timeline. Because you experience the tragedy of Linda Hansen's husband's death as a precursor to the actual event, you wonder if the reason for the foreknowledge is to prevent the event if possible. But what plays out is the eventual causation of the tragic accident at the focus of the story. Then you wonder: If it couldn't have been prevented, what's the point to knowing ahead what would happen? The filmmakers did a good job of bringing meaning to what appears at first as a senseless tragedy. It was well acted and filmed. It bears watching again to see how the plot elements tie together."
2,Blah,"Spoilers - ------- - - ---The main character did some involuntary time traveling throughout a certain week. The things she learned during this week, since it was out of order, caused her to inevitably kill her husband. However, she knew he was going to die on mile marker 220, but why didn't she tell him to not go there and definitely not stop his car there? The main characters become total idiots at the end of the movie. ""Do you trust me? (then pull out into the middle of the highway without looking)Nice going. Unsatisfying ending."
2,Very Disapointing,"Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses but this movie was very disappointing. If you look at the premise or the trailer it sounds like it has the potential to be a pretty good suspense thriller. It disappoints on all fronts. Its not scary, not thought provoking, and not worth watching!"
4,Premonition,It's a pretty good movie. Sandra Bullock's character deliver a strong feeling of confusion that is primarily the subject of the movie. Generally speaking I think people won't feel their money wasted.
2,Back & Forth,"There was too much back and forth in this movie. Heck, it was hard to keep track of. It started out good, then went pretty much downhill from there. One question, in the end if hubby wanted to cut it off with the ho, why didn't he just call her from work? Why did he start to drive to the hotel? Why did Sandra Bullock's character make him turn the car around? She should have just pulled up behind him. Remember, throughout the whole movie all she was trying to do was save him (and their marriage). So much for faith, eh?"
1,Underwhelming,"Ugh, the trailer seemed interesting but the movie never delivered. The ending was very underwhelming. It probably would not have made a difference if they filmed the movie in chronological sequence rather than skipping days back and forth. Skip the movie. Take a naps instead."
3,"Creepy at times, but a love story in the end","Sandra Bullock is practically the whole show here as a woman who wakes to find her hubby dead, but then not dead. Over and over, we see her go back and forth, until it all begins to make a little sense, or does it? Little of this is realistic, even the scenes where nothing is happening, such as when Bullock climbs in the shower fully clothed with hubby after having a premonition. Instead of laughing at her and calling her crazy, he just stands there looking pensive...Hmmmm.... The whole movie goes on that way."
3,Good but not great,"This movie was a little thin on storyline and acting, but still enjoyable. I will watch almost anything with Sandra Bullock and I like Julian McMahon generally, but together they had no chemistry. As much as I like mystery/suspense dramas and plots with twists, this wasn't one of my favorites. Too many time jumps/flashbacks for my taste. Nevertheless, I'm not sorry I bought it, and will watch it from time to time."
4,Good resource for teaching ballet to adults,"I purchased this book after I was asked to teach a recreational adult/teen beginning ballet class. It provides a good overview of how to structure a class and how to build on lessons. There is also extensive discussion on teaching the basic concepts of ballet (beyond the actual steps) such as posture, alignment, turnout, counterpull, distribution of weight, etc. I also liked the fact that the authors provide suggestions for teaching images and teaching cues to use. I will definitely continue to use it as a reference, however this book was clearly intended for those teaching ballet at the college level. There is a great deal of discussion on how to structure written examinations, written assignments, and performance tests which was not relevant for my needs, though others may find this aspect quite helpful."
5,Excellent resource,"This book was written to be used in an academic setting but is an excellent resource for teaching beginning ballet in general. I was a dancer for many years, but I am just now getting in to teaching. Like the authors said, it is good to get a review because it is a long time since I was a beginner. The book helps to clarify what beginners can and can't do. I just skipped over the parts about tailoring your classes to teaching in high school/college since it didn't apply."
4,Good reference guide!,"As a new dance teacher, I have ordered several books and other resources on teaching. This book is definitely a good purchse - it basically outlines class format and what should be covered for various levels of beginners. I feel it also applies to intermediate students as well. Lots of pictures and descriptions make it easy to understand. I would recommend it for any ballet teacher."
3,Double Check,I ordered this item to replace my current charger. This charger did not fit the radios that I have. You will want to double check your radio model when ordering the charger. It is not a one size fits all.
4,Handy to have on long drive,We used these to communicate between 4 cars while on a long drive on vacation. The batteries will run down after a couple of hours so you must have a car charger. The range is not quite as far as advertised but they work well if you keep the other vehicle in sight
3,Broken peices,"I bought this product to replace the batteries in my radios for work. The extra cradle was a good bonus. The 12 volt car adapter wasnt a neccessity. Thats good considering it arrived broken. The cradle came in one peice and the batteries work great. They hold a damn good charge under heavy use. I have not contacted the seller about the 12 volt adapter, but I'm sure if I did, they would have made it right. Like I said, I just didnt need that. I was very surprised to receive my package 2 days before I expected. Quality product, and quality seller. I would definately buy from them again."
2,Not at all a Tami Hoag caliber book,"I love all of Tami Hoag's books, especailly Night Sins, Cry Wolf and Dark Paradise. This book was merely a ghost tale with a little romance mixed in for good measure. This had some great characters who could have been expanded on, but the book was too predictable."
2,not the usual standard,"What a let down this book was. I read 'Guilty as sin' a while back and loved it, so I've been reading some of her other books. None of them have been as good, this one is particularly bad. I find that Tami Hoag's books are rather predictable, and are more romance than crime. Gorgeous girl meets handsome man, cue lashings of sex (depicted in graphic detail) and not much else. In 'Magic' there is no plot, just a predictable romance between the two major characters. This is so similar to another Hoag book 'Lucky's Lady': the man and woman, both good looking, meet, don't get along, but are overcome with sexual desires and end up in bed.Boring, is my verdict on this book."
5,The best Huapango trio,"This CD is unbelieveable. It sounds as if the same eight bars are coming around for an hour, but with such lively energy and through such deliciously subtle variations, you will NEVER tire of this robust, cheerful, almost trance-inducing set. If you understand Spanish, or care to look up the lyrics in the accompanying booklet, these songs are at turns poetic and hilarious. Soaring violin, heroic and graceful falsettoes, and heartbeat-steady, pulsing guitar rhythyms make ""The Muse"" one of the best damned CDs ever made."
5,What great fun!! If you want to be entertained--this is it.,Bette is the consumate entertainer. She actually cares what her fans want and she gives it to them in spades. Bette can tease you and then make you cry in a matter of one track. If you love Bette you will love this new release. Thanks Bette!
4,"Quality ""Adult Contemporary""","If you're at all familiar with Bette Midler, you'll know what to expect with this album: competent, middle of the road muzak. ""Bathhouse Betty"", though, is reasonably representative of quality easy listening. Midler sings her expectedly undistinguished, by-the-numbers ballads, but sprinkles a few surprises in the mix, notably Tin Pan Alley gems like ""Ukelele Lady"" and ""I Sold My Heart..."", and the accomplished r'n'b of ""Big Socks"" (thanks largely to writer and producer Chuckii Booker). The closer, ""Laughing Matters"", is a maudlin tune that somehow works. Pretty much like the album."
5,Finally!!!!,"Very seldom do I give 5 stars unless it is well deserved. Well, this product is. It is so hard to find flex band aids 1"". They stay on longer, don't wash off and stretch. I love them and will purchase again when I run out.Thanks, Band-Aid."
5,Great instructional book,"This is a great instructional book for the aspiring Naturalist or journal keeper. The instruction is well written and geared for the beginner to advance intermediate skill level but may provide some good tips for the more advanced artist. As the title states, this book provides many examples of the more common animals that can be found (for a while anyway) in Florida. I was able to advance my ability quite a bit by using this book in my nature journaling and sketch sessions. If you take your time and stick to it, this book should provide great instruction."
3,The Purpose Driven Life,"I purchased this book as new or like new. It had writing in the front page, and no cover, it also was a hardcover book, making it difficult to use as a gift. It would of been fine if it was for me, I think these things should be told in the description so people know what they are going to get."
5,Great Book,This is one of my favorite books By Tracie. It talks about true things that goes on in everyday lives. It is also a very sweet romance.
4,Excellent tear-jerker,"Will Smith hit another home run in this one. It's a bit predictable from time to time, but is so well done and performed, I didn't really care.It makes you think a little differently about people and how we should treat one another and how deeply one stranger can affect your life or you affect another. Well done and be prepared to shed some tears."
5,A Superhero movie.,"Did you like Crash? Then you will likely enjoy this flick.Rosario Dawson knocked it out of the park!Slow to start, great finish.Accept movies for what they are. This was a heartwarming movie."
4,Seven Pounds,"Movie had a really good story line, it was just a ""little slow"". Will Smith is a great actor and did a good job."
4,Pretty good,"I like the plot of the movie; you don't really know what is going on until the end (although you might be able to guess a few things). It's pretty sad but also very fulfilling; you end up just feeling good about the ending. I feel the characters should have been developed a little more (at least Will Smith's character), but I liked it overall."
4,good Smith vehicle,"I like Will movies, and this is one of my favorites....did I mention Rosario Dawson is not too shabby? A story line twist that completes the circle."
2,This movie BLOWS!,"I did not like this movie. I felt that the only good actor in this was Will Smith. I had no idea what it was about going into it. After watching it, I wish that I had so I could have avoided it. For all the praise it achieved from people, I hated it. Will Smith should stick to comedies."
4,A Note about Rosario . . .,"NO WAY, absolutely positively no way that she winds up with Woody Harrleson . . . UNBELIEVABLE. No way!Bad casting on Woody, bad acting . . . a throwaway"
1,poor,the company sent the wrong item.They were good about crediting my account. I did view this from a friend and didn't like it at all. The plot is too confusing and it jumps around in the beginning. It's a warped way of thinking too and not realistic.
4,Great movie for great thinkers,"Not a light-hearted movie, but worth watching for sure. If you like a mystery to figure out or if you like to consider the really important things in life, you'll want to see it. Not a typical Will Smith movie, and not a typical movie at all. If you want something with meaning, watch it. Don't try to figure out what the title has to do with the plot; you can find the answer to that if you Google it after you see the movie."
5,Absolutely Fantastic & very touching movie!!! I cried!!!,"Will Smith should have been given at least an oscar nomination for his performance in this movie! Seven Pounds is my movie of the year--2008. He was so into his character and has taken his acting abilities to a new level. Who would have believed 20 years ago that a young rapper called the ""Fresh Prince"" would become an outstanding, multifaceted actor on television and on the silver screen? Thumbs up to Will Smith!!! I do hope that he will win an Oscar at some point in his acting career; he deserves it."
2,"two stars for ""heart""","the idea wasn't bad...the acting was sufficient...the film was just a mess, however.it was unclear and so non-linear that it was impossible to follow, until you got it, then the last 40 min become unbearable because it is predictable."
5,thought provoking,How can one even out the score...or correct a wrong? Is it our place to try to even things out? This movie brings up lots of questions and interesting answers.
5,These are great,I've been using these for gigs for half a year now and have no complaints. I can see these being the last mallets I ever buy.
1,Disappointed,"The bag was not designed for a live, five pound dog. My dog looked so frustrated inside the bag for the few seconds he was in it. It was incredibly uncomfortable for him, me, and my family who saw the unhappy fellow via webcam. It was a complete waste of money and too late for a return due to damage done to the drawstring by the annoyed little dog. Sigh."
1,social worker,"the medium carrier is too small for a 10 lb dog. the bottom will not hold the dog up. My dog has his hind legs in it and holds on to my arm with the front two legs. It is hardly a ""hands free"" carrier. Very disappointing."
3,Small,"Our 17 lb dog did not fit. The pack maybe able to carry the weight, but, if the pet is slim with log legs he/she will not fit."
2,For beginners only,"This book is simple, direct, very basic, and unfortunately I agree with others who feel it's primary purpose is to sell other products and services."
5,Hands down best conditioner,"Having parents that are Dominican, I am constantly caught between the ""bad hair/good hair"" discussion with people. This conditioner is the ultimate in moisture, manageability, shine, THE WHOLE PACKAGE. I LOVE this conditioner. It's a shame that it's not available in larger quantities because I would purchase it by the BARREL. My hair is very curly and frizzy in its natural state and so when I straighten it, it becomes dry and dull. After using this conditioner my hair has been restored to its healthiest state. It doesn't even feel like my hair anymore! I give this conditioner an A+++++. If you are thinking about buying it, STOP THINKING! Just do it; you won't regret it."
2,The tube looks big but it is not,This is the same size tube that is in the gray solutions box. So for $10.00 I could have purchased the product w/the tube. But I purchased the gloss treatment thinking it was more. So for $16.00 I got the tube only. Not to happy with it but it is my fault for not reading more in to it. So if you need more just buy a box of coloring w/ tube in it.!!! I had to pay shipping is why it was higher than advertised.
1,Simplisitic,"It's quite amazing that this book is a business best-seller. The book contains nothing new and, in fact, the 17 so-called ""laws"" are just overblown statements of the obvious. For example, in the Law of Significance, the author ""explodes"" the myth of the lone ranger by stating that ""the belief that one person can do something great is a myth."" Really? In the Law of the Big Picture he says, ""people who build successful teams never forget that every person on the team has a role to play and every role plays its part in contributing to the big picture."" Another insight? I could go on. However, equally important, the book does not contain any new research or even interviews with key team leaders. The conclusions, such as they are, come from secondary sources such as the popular press and the author's personal examples, none of which seem to be based on any real business experiences. I returned the book to Amazon."
2,Disappointing,"I've only read a few books by Feehan, but this one was a huge disappointment. After a reasonably good opening, the author launched into page after page of backstory. By the time she resumed going forward, I'd lost much of my interest in the rather thin plot. Apart from some sizzling sensual imagery toward the end, there is little reason to read this novel. If you want paranormal romance, try Wild Rain instead."
1,A disappointing book from a talented writer,"I have been a fan of Christine Feehan's work since Dark Prince. However, with this book I was not drawn into the world of the characters and found myself annoyed as I attempted to read it. I do not mind a bit of repetition in theme (I enjoy her Carpathian novels) and there are only so many basic plot elements to choose from. What I do mind is a lack of focus. There were too many characters with too little substance. The dialogue was often forced and stilted. The romance between the two ""main"" characters was weak and they never captured my interest. The constant push for scrapbooking by the aunt and her plug for a scrapbooking company was ridiculous and jarring. While I usually finish a book in one sitting, it took me three days to force myself to read 74 pages. At this point, I have given up."
4,Amazon's terrible service,"My daughter is a Pink Panther fan. In November,, i ordered3 Pink Panther movies in November. In November three were sent out. Somehow, two out of three were sent to the wrong address and arrived in February. She had already left for college.My wife and I love to watch the Quiet Man for St Patrick's Day. Order shipped a couple of weeks ago. DID NOT arrive before St Patrick's Day. There is no way to contact a human at Amazon. Not able to write Amazon to inquire. Can only contact them to order more items. Movie is good. You may want to get it somewhere else unless you feel like waiting three months."
4,pink panther2,Not as funny as the 1st pink panther but steve martin still shines as the bumbling inspector. The movie is funny in its own right but if youve seen pink panther 1 you might not enjoy it as much but it is still worth seeing.
2,Bad experience with seller,"I ordered all of the Dollanger Saga in one inning, I am a BIG reader. All of the books I ordered used (because I'm cheap). They all arrived promptly and were all good quality.. Except If There Be Thorns. from the outside it looked good, apparently used, but good quality. Once I started reading I noticed the middle pages, about twenty of them, were almost falling out. They were basically on the last hinges. Once I got to the middle the pages actually fell out. This was very annoying - I had to tape all of the pages back into the book and now the pages are not all aligned."
5,this book was fantastic,"well, i think the fist two books were better, but i couldnt seem to put this book down. i do have to admit it was good, but the way bart acted was getting annoing. and i disagree with cathy and chris's ""marriage"" but their love for each other made me foeget the were inscets, that shows how good v.c. andrews is. i am reading seed of yesterday now, and so far it seems to have my attetion as all her other books did."
3,Many typing errors,It may just be this copy but there are so many typing errors in this book. It is extreemly distracting to me. That is why I gave it only 3 stars.
3,Good but a little dull,This book seems out of place with the other Dollanger books because of giant gaps of time between the first and third book. Don't need to read the book to understand the whole series. Told from the view of children so nothing risky about the content. Good read if you like to know everything about the characters.
2,Disappointing,"I can't say very much for this series in the plethora of Andrews' books. I can say, however, that this metaphorical cow has been milked excessively. Andrews had perfectly written the story in ""Flowers in the Attic"" and ""Petals on the Wind"", but the story continues when an old woman in black moves in next door to Chris and Cathy, who have married. Now they have two children, Jory and Bart, who are very different. Bart gets drawn into the old woman's home and atmosphere and takes on a strange attitude after being around the butler and his propaganda. I had a weak plot and wasn't as satisfying as her other works."
5,great for long straight runs,"used 3 times in the last 6 years and always gets the job done. it will only work with one bend down the clearout and turns to the street, my run is just under 100 ft so this fits the bill just right. bought two just to have second on hand."
1,incredibly boring,"This was the first book by Silverberg I have ever read with the exception of ""The Positronic Man"" written with Isaac Asimov. As that was a very good book and Silverberg having somewhat of a reputation, I had many expectations of this book only to have none of them met. The story line was weak, the characters as developed as cardboard, and the dialogue almost laughable. I felt as though I was reading the script for a childs cheap cartoon, not a novel. A definite don't read."
2,Disappointing,"This book has the same plot as ""Lord Valentine's Castle"" (rightful prince is overthrown by usurper). Silverberg is capable of far better."
1,A VEEERRRY Expensive fix,I used this a total of once before it broke. Worst is that it broke in my toilet and has wedged in and clogged the main drain pipe out of our house. We are now waiting for the plumber to open the pipe and remove it! How much will this cost!!!! Do Not Buy This Product!
1,Calcium Propionate IS BAD for you!,"This author is wrong. My Sister and I cannot even have one bite of calcium propionate without suffering severe flare ups of pain, bloating, rib pain, etc...CP is banned in several countries, which is not mentioned. It is a toxic pesticide for God's sake. My Aunt was doubling over in pain every night and after medical tests showed nothing, I told her to look at the labels of what she eats...she was eating a ton of calcium propionate in breads etc...it was the cause of her pain! Do some research. This preservative is nasty. It builds in the body and eventually, in some people, will destroy your digestive system."
5,A Tale of Two Cities,I really liked this movie and I wish it would come out in dvd.It brought back a lot of memories of American Bandstand and my teen aged years.The plot line reminds me of A Tale of Two Cities.
5,Postmark Paradise is special delivery,"This is a delightfully funny AND poignant movie set in a comfortable small town in Michigan that could of been ANYWHERE, USA. It's easy to watch, easy to smile with and easy to think about. One of my top five movies of all time."
1,Forget it!,"I bought mine about three years ago, and rapidly found out what all the complaints about battery life were about. The unit has a high current drain for detecting outside devices, even when ""shut off"" and it pulls the battery down quickly to zero charge.Sound was great for such a portable unit. Too bad Logitech has taken a completely unacceptable battery replacement stance (after originally claiming they would offer a replacement battery!) which you will find hundreds of irate customers if you do a google search.To Logitech engineering...put a damn switch on the unit to totally shut it off!! Offer a battery replacement! Wake up and find yet another customer who will NEVER buy any other Logitech product."
2,Not bad if you only need it for a couple months,"As far as the sound quality for the price, it's great. Unfortunately, my first system lasted approximately two months before it simply quit. I just couldn't power it on anymore. I took it back to Costco & exchanged it for another. Fool me once, shame on you...fool me twice...this unit lasted about the same amount of time. I tried to power it on this morning, and it's just as dead as the first unit. I should point out the unit sits in my climate-controlled office and gets minimal usage - it's never been outside, on trips, or anything else that might compromise its inner workings.I haven't gone through the reviews to see if anyone else has had this problem, but I for one will NOT be buying another hoping the 3rd time's a charm."
5,Great Sound,"Wonderful deep sound at high volume. Carry case helps keeping unit looking new. Only issue is one control button fell off, however still able to control the funtion by carefully pressing finger into the opening."
3,Expected more for the money,"I expected better sound and volume (be able to play it louder) for the money. Its advantage is that it is portable with rechargeable batteries. But since this wasn't a feature I really needed, I should have bought a PC speaker system with an amplified sub."
4,Very good speaker system for the price,"The speakers arrived much earlier than expected, which was a plus. The system itself is very compact and looks great. The speaker system is truly easy to set up-- you simply select the right fitting for your Ipod and plug it in.The speakers sound excellent, especially considering the size of the system. The included remote is a nice touch, although it can be maddeningly unresponsive. Overall, I recommend these speakers."
4,Good sound for the price,Used this with our Ipod on vacation. Worked out very well for long playing and can re-charge your Ipod when plugged in. Overall a good value.
2,Meh.,"You definitely get what you pay for. The leather is poor quality, and it has this really ugly marbling on it that is not shown in the picture. All the credit card slots have a gummy glue in them which gets all over my cards and makes it an ordeal to get them in and out. Clearly this thing was factory assembled by children in China."
3,Eh,"Im not thrilled with the quality of these shoes, but I'm writing more to inform Amazoners that these shoes are NOT THE COLOR DEPICTED. AThese are much a lighter shade of brown - and a not particularly attractive color at that. Please refer to kenneth cole's website or somewhere else to get an accurate gauge of the color before purchasing."
1,Incomplete Template Information; Code doesn't link,"I bought this book as there are not many books that focuses on templates. As such, I was quite disappointed that only the first chapter talked about templates in general. Also, different C++ compilers treat templates differently (e.g. Unix vs. Visual C++). Examples, getting code to compile under both would have been quite helpful/useful.The template library offered did not link under Visual C++ - some files were just missing from the disk!! There is an executable given that tests the library - but so what!! I assumed the author tested his code!"
3,"Cheap screen, but does the job.","This IS one of the flimsy screens that you have seen in the presentationrooms so many times before. I thought it might be a nice one, but in fact,I was wrong.It works okay, the screen is bright and it will reflect a Powerpoint, but don'texpect anything fancy. Just folding it up and down is a chore.Lugging it around isn't too bad, but I wouldn't recommend it for an extended period of time.If you need a screen quick and cheap like I did, go for it. If you need something thatyou need to last for a long time (more than a few years), then spend the extra$100-200 and get a really nice one.The DaLite screens are all the flimsy models."
4,Less fuss is a must!,After a busy day or lazy day using so few ingrients allows you less preparation mess and quicker ready to cook meals.
4,Simple,"I like short and simple.Although I've only had a chance to use a couple recipesI am glad I bought the bookI have been cooking and baking for aprox 50 years-I'm ""burnt out"" but my husband insists we still have to eat, SOOOOI am always looking for: as I said short & simple, especially withthe small crock pot!!"
3,Poor Range,"Nowhere close to 10 miles, maybe a mile if it is not too crowded.No battery indicator, or charge indicator, a real pain since you can't work out what state the thing is in and whether it needs recharging. I bought two packs and one of the four does not seem to work, but I don't know if its just the battery, since there is no battery level/charge indication to tell me what going wrong. They work, sound quality is decent and are good for close range, Disneyworld/Beach. 2 stars of performance but gave then 3 because of low cost - you get what you pay for?"
4,what a relief,"This book gives you the insight that only o.j. can give. With very dynamic prose, he tells you what can only be the truth from the heart of a grieving widower. I feel sorry for the man who lost not only the beloved mother of his kids, but a brilliant acting career. His life was stolen from him by a quick to judge public. This is a must read."
4,HESS TRUCK WITH RACECARS,These trucks are first quality and almost indestructable. I look forward each year to their new vehicle and so do all of my younger grandsons. A great product for the money.
3,Carmen Miranda Collection,"Dear Friends,IT WAS WONDERFUL to watch Carmen Miranda in all her glory. BUT BUT BUT one of the discs was restored very poorly -- ""Something for the Boys"". The color was off, the quality was diluted and foggy....It should NOT have been included if it was NOT up to the others' standard. BUT, thanks for giving us the treat of re-living the good old days. Thanks. Ben and Gladys Caterinicchio"
5,A Testimonial the author received- #2,"""My older brother died unexpectedly last week at the age of 48. I volunteered to give the eulogy because no one else in the family felt they could do it. I wasn't sure I could do it, but felt someone in the family should do it.I learned of your book on the internet and ordered it. It was the best thing I could have done. After reading about clustering, I tried it and I didn't stop writing for thirty minutes...ideas just poured out of my mind. I also found your tips for delivering the eulogy to be very helpful.As you suggested, I found this experience to be one of the most rewarding of my life. I felt good about the eulogy and many of the over 200 people in attendance told me it was the best eulogy they ever heard.So....thank you for making this book available....I highly recommend it to anyone who finds themselves in the position I was in last week.Sincerely,G. E. Smith"
1,Not totally accurate,"My mother and I purchased this book and were sorely disappointed.This book is *not* recommended ... and especially not for vegetarians. Martin and Gerstung (the authors) believe that ""substituting soy for milk, cheese, and meat can block the absorption of important nutrients."" As though that is not already absurd, the authors go on to state that soy milk is ""lacking in needed natural vitamins and cholesterol."" Needed cholesterol??? That statement is simply outrageous. The truth is that not only do most people have enough (or even too much) cholesterol in their bodies already, but the human body *manufactures* all the cholesterol it needs. Cholesterol is found in nearly all animal-derived foods, and is absent from all plant-based foods. The consumption of cholesterol is neither necessary nor beneficial for good health.My recommendation? Try out a book by Dr. Andrew Weil or Dr. Dean Ornish for more accurate information."
4,delightful book,"This is a delightful book. It's beautiful to look through and very inspiring. There are a variety of recipes including ones combining different fruits to make jams, jellies, or preserves. Although some of the recipes aren't as precise as I'd like, I love experimenting with recipes and making then my own. You can hardly go wrong with fruit and sugar!"
3,Just Ok,"I loved the Fit For Life diet and was hoping for new receipes along the same lines. I was mistaken, this cookbook is just a rehash of Fit For Life, reusing many of the same receipes. What's more the receipes are not very good, I have tried quite a few, many have ingredients that can only be gotten at speciality stores, receipes are not very comprehensive or thorough and some receipes just plain suck. Many better choices out there."
2,For the hard-core vegetarian.,"I have recently decided to become a vegetarian and this is the first vegetarian book that I have bought. It is filled with meatless, dairy-free recipes, and is great for someone who is familiar with spices and veggies that are not widely used. I found it intimidating and will probably not use this one very much. This is a book for true health nuts."
1,Not a perfect accent at all!!,"I have been teaching my daughter French since she was born. I speak French fluently, but my accent is far from perfect, so when I learned about this CD I was delighted: this was (or so I thought) exactly what I needed to make up for my not-so-great pronunciation. Was I dissappointed!! The accent in the CD is worse than mine!"
4,Good,"A nice book. It made me wish I had more dolls. The only thing I can say is at first I thought I would never be able to read it. Then I found out, I could read it in a day! P.S. my name is Lydia. heehee"
1,Anti-Christian Revisionism,"This confusingly written accountThe Crusadescombines poor scholarship with a heavily anti-Christian bias. The author has oversimplified the complex relationship between the two great religions of the world. His verdict: Christians are bad, Muslims are good. According to Mr. Paine, the life of non-Muslims in Islamic lands: being forced to pay a tax to be non-Muslim and being discriminated against is ""reasonable"". He portrays the evil Christians as the sole source of every conflict. He dismisses centuries of Muslim aggression, murder and forced conversions as a minor inconvenience.The author displays his own ignorance and prejudice when he states that Christians, Jews and Muslims worship the same God and that Islam is arguably the more advanced stage of Christianity. Christians are instructed by their religion to pray that Mr. Paine see the truth. Muslims are instructed by their religion to kill him if he does not submit. Can both be serving the same God?"
3,Worth the money but ...,"This is a really good video as far as the content goes. However the video quality is very poor. It looks like they used a VCR/DVD combo unit to record the VCR version onto a DVD.I think this video could use an update. That being said, the content was very helpful."
1,2nd half missing,"I ordered this for my son. He watched in excitement but then when it came time for Part Two, there was nothing there. I ordered a replacement, which was sent promptly. Same problem, in the exact same place. Part Two is not there."
3,"It's OK, not the best","I've been using this product on my Keratosis Pilaris for about a month now. It has mainly been more of a smoothing cream. When I use it before I go to bed my skin feels softer in the morning. The redness from my KP is still there though. It has a really weird feeling after you rub it all in. It actually makes my hands feel dried out, which is really strange. It seems like a product you would have to use continuously if you want to keep the smoothness, so it's definitely not a miracle. I think it's over priced and feel there could be something better out there for KP. I just haven't found it yet :("
2,hype,"hype hype hype. all hype. the only thing that topical creams CAN do is moisturize. You can get very good moisturizers at drugstores, and need not spend 60-100 dollars for them.i'm sorry to tell all you folks out there hoping for miracle wrinkle cures that your ONLY options to get rid of those lines are 1. don't get any in the first place and 2. cosmetic surgery.prevention is best cure. for all you folks who don't have huge wrinkles yet, AVOID prolonged sun exposure, drink lots of water and eat lots of fruits and vegetables. living healthy is your best fight against aging, not shedding cash on ""miracle"" creams."
1,worse product ever,"I was very dissappointed in this product , I wrote a review and got prompt attention a call saying i would recieve a refund if i took my review off . i did that . never recieved my refund. will never purchase from this company again. although i will use Amazon again."
2,"Good thesis, but terribly repetitive","The main point of this book is well supported with examples from ""innovative"" organizations. However, I was continually under the impression that this was a 30 page research paper converted into a 200 page book. How did the author accomplish this feat? Repeat, repeat, repeat. This book is full of redundancies, repetitions, summaries, and introductions that are all superfluous. When you're done reading this book, you will know the examples of good innovators by heart because they are repeated in every chapter, sometimes multiple times."
1,Nasty,"The book wasn't what I want it, neither what I expected. The book was dirty inside and outside, it wasn't even the edition that I ask for."
4,"Yes, it IS a video compiliation","This DVD includes 17 music videos, including three from their reunion album, ""Don't Mind If I Do"". The 1983 concert is also included, as an extra feature, making this a great value. I love blue-eyed soul, and Boy George is one of the best in the genre."
5,He's a little less afraid of me! lol,"I had to laugh at the TV ad for this product ,the lady holding the sign ""He not afraid of me now"" or something like that.That was me before I started taking Estroven.lol Just ask my poor Hubby! We finally got his head back on right after I bit it off so many times ;.)"
5,Purchase Estroven,Excellent product have used it for six months prior to this - another Amazon purchase. Significantly assists in menopausal symptoms. Delivery was exactly as advised - very impressed with the seller. Unable to take Estrogen type products - this has been a miracle.
4,I was taken back to the 60's!,"Every Saturday night Wilmer played at Club 86 in Geneva, NY. We wouldn't have missed it for anything! As it turned out, I married someone who used to see Wilmer play on Friday nights at Bristol Ski Lodge in Canandaigua. Those were fun days!"
4,Good info for the price,"This book explains the primary problems with Evolution theory in language understandable to the non paleontologist. It is an interesting, and sometimes entertaining read."
2,Not as easy at it looks,"Maybe I need to let the icing dry first, but these did not work as I expected."
3,Slightly Surprising,"This recording is a surprisingly weak follow-up to its superb predecessor, ANA. With the exception of the very striking composition ""Anthem"", the writing here seems unfocused. The playing is superb (as always), as is the recorded sound. If, like me, you find even lesser works from Ralph Towner to be far preferable to most all other alternatives, then you should purchase this recording with no reservations. But if you are looking for a recording which stands up to ""ANA"", ""Batik"", ""City Of Eyes"", ""Old Friends New Friends"", and some of Ralph's other great ones, you may be disappointed here."
2,"Too much fighting, not enough loving","I thought from the other reviews I read that I would like this book, but I was sorely disappointed. The first part was very promising, but once it progressed, the plot really tanked. The two main characters made me mad with all of their anger and frustration toward each other, keeping secrets for no good reason and constantly getting hot for each other in spite of how angry they were. None of their actions matched who they seemed to be at the beginning and when they finally DID reveal their motivations, it didn't seem to relate to what had already been written. We get all of this emotion and turmoil in their first encounter, but when they finally talk about it later, they don't reference the same emotions or even events. I found it frustrating!And then all of a sudden they each just decide they love the other and everything works out in the last 10 pages. I was annoyed and started skipping whole sections just to finish it!"
1,NOTHING WORKS...THIS EITHER,"I haven't seen the slightest change with the dark circles under my eyes yet. Grant it I've only been using it two weeks, but I definitely am not one of the lucky ones that can say I see any immediate changes at all. Unlike others who don't like this product underneath their makeup, I don't have a problem with it. I put it on, then some eye hydrate and then my concealor that I so badly need. Doctors said for yeeeeeeeeeears my problem was allergy related, then last year they said it was birth control related, and now they say it appears my blood vessels seem to be damaged. Whatever the case, NOTHING is helping, not Hylexin, no Hydroxatone, not Lemon Eye gel, not hydroquinone a bleaching cream and NOT VITA-K SOLUTION SUPER VITAMIN K. Just isn't working for me."
3,Survival in Combat,"I found this to be an interesting booklet, but it is almost impossible to demonstrate any fighting technique with only 1-3 cartoon drawings. Of course, this was a WWII publication, so large computer animation wasn't feasible, nor Youtube videos. The reason for the low rating is because this is so dated.The greatest value of this book is the development of a kill-or-be-killed attitude in life-threatening situations. The reticence to use violence has become pervasive in our society, seriously handicapping someone who wants to survive. For this purpose, I recommend this to anyone who has the remotest possibility of being in this situation. Which, of course, is really everyone.The other reason for buying this is to gain an historical insight into the conditions leading to the US involvement in WWII, and how Britain and the US were preparing for Nazi aggression."
5,The great Ms. Walker. One of my all time favorite books,I bought this book for the Lora Leigh story (Cowboy & the Captive) but staid for the Shiloh Walker story. Don't get me wrong Leigh's story is good but I gave the five stars here for the first book;(Her Wildest Dreams). I liked the fact that the heroin did not cower away when she was pushed aside in the beginning by her hero and that she took herself on a trip purely for self redemption. The love scenes are scalding hot and the chemistry between the two is so strong you can reach out and touch it. I simply fell in love with Ms. Walker's book.
4,Sopranos entertaining book,This was an ideal present for a Sopranos fan who is difficult to buy for; a great mix of recipes with input from the characters.
3,Informative but too restrictive,"I found the information helpful in understand the acid/alkaline science, but the proposed diet would be extremely hard to incorporate into ones life unless very motivated and dedicated to change."
3,PH diet,A lot of chemistry and I like chemistry. I tried it for about a week (not long enough) and couldn't stick with it. I think the book needs more food lists and repititious on the listings. Tough diet to stick with. I think anyone would lose weight it you ate primarily veggies all the time. Not a bad idea don't get me wrong just not so easy to do.
3,It was good but incomplete,"I thought this was a good book with a lot of great information about health but what disappointed me was the alkaline food list or lack thereof. There are so many foods that aren't listed as being alkaline or alkalinizing in the body. I believe a diet that includes as many healthful foods as possible is important and these foods aren't included here. If you look at other alkaline food lists you will see what I mean!Also the use of soy is a problem for me as there are so many problems with soy, one being that most of it is genetically modified! I could have missed it but I don't remember the author even mentioning to eat organic soy if you are going to eat soy...that really bothered me. I would rather avoid soy altogether. I make my own kefir at home with raw goats milk. Kefir is alkalinizing in the body and what about fermented vegetables? Alkalinizing! There are so many more food choices to know about."
5,Life change,Book was in excellent conditioned as stated. Wish the shipping was faster but book was delivered within the time frame stated. No complaints would purchase again from seller. Price was a super deal! Thank you.
2,Different chain,"The pendant itself is beautiful, but the cross came on a really cheap and ugly chain that resembles something you'd see on a key chain, not someones neck. It would be different if the seller showed this in the picture (I wouldn't have bought it if they had), but they didn't. They showed something that actually looks halfway decent.I guess don't buy this unless you have a chain to put the pendant on."
5,John Sheirer Book,"A good read if you are from S. E. PA, or a relation to SHEIRER family. Brings back alot of memories for people who moved away from Bedford county area."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This book is more about bagels, than actually about MAKING bagels. I would recommend Joan Nathan's ""Jewish Cooking In America"" for a book that has a better recipe for bagels as well as SO much more to offer (heck, even if you are only looking for the bagel recipe her book is still a better way to spend your money)."
3,wild design little mouse,"Actually I'm a linux user who barely use mouse. When it comes to gaming, I got to switch to my windows7 and use a mouse to shoot my enemies. Then that's when this mouse starts to shine. It moves with precision and never got stuck on the table. The tail, when lit, looks like an angry lizard. Not mentioning the easy-to-custom interface which, if you set to Alt+F4, could let you close your porn faster than ever!!!(Commented by one of my roommate). However, I don't quite like its shape when I first saw it. It looks soooo creepy. I was expecting a office friendly design when I booked it on amazon. Then it turns out to be something punk. Kind of surprised."
4,Magnificent Magnifying Mouse,"It was the compact size and scroll wheel that first attracted this petite woman to theMicrosoft Notebook Optical Mouse 3000. Since I'd planned to use it with my laptop, the short USB didn't seem like it would be problematic. However, I like the ergonomic fit so much, I find that I use this mouse with my desktop computer, too, and the short length is a nuisance on that full size computer.The center scroll wheel tilts left and right, and can be pushed to Enter (to select), but the tiny left side button is the gilt on this great little mouse...it enables/disables a magnifying function that is such a bonus for tired eyes. Only wireless functionality with multiple bases for use on my differet computers could improve on performance."
4,Disable accelerated scrolling and its great!,"I like this mouse. It is small, stylish and inexpensive. Plugged it into my laptop and the drivers were automatically installed in Windows 7. The placement of the side button works well.My only gripe was with the scroll wheel. At first, scrolling tended to be imprecise. Using it in games, for instance, would rapidly scroll through all my items and then end up back on the first item. I found out later that this annoying little ""feature"" could be disabled: go to the control panel, click mouse properties, go to the wheel tab, click advanced, and clear the ""enable accelerated scrolling"" option."
4,Good mouse so far,"So far so good. It's just a bit on the small side but for the price, a good deal. It is better than the last cheap mouse I had-- seems very accurate and responsive. Works with no problem on new MacBook Pro, no need to download any software or install anything-- just plug & go. Scroll wheel tilts sideways too, works great."
3,Not what I wanted.,"Bought this Mouse to replace the one I had for my Desktop. First thing, was that the cord was shorter than my old one and wouldn""t reach. Then noticed that this was labeled for a notebook. DUH!. Now only use with my laptop."
4,"As pictured, possibly slightly light weight...","The delivery and design of the part are exactly as described on line. The bulkhead is appropriate for light-weight applications (such as my 75 gallon aquarium). However, the user should beware that tubing clamps can crack such barbs at relatively low clamping levels-- this happened to my previous bulkhead. In high-risk applications, I'd recommend an 8"" nylon wire cable clamp for vinyl tubing applications where vibration or vertical weight might otherwise loosen the joint over time. Heavier duty bulkheads are available -- but they are bulkier so may not fit in tight locations."
4,Erm...yeah....,"Hiya. For me, this book was great! It helped me with a lot of cosplay. I'd be lost on the Miroku costume without it. ^_^ This book is great, even if you can't read Japanese (I can! Haha!). If you haven't been keeping up with the Japanese manga or newly release episodes, this may spoil a bit for you. It has great unreleased art and color manga srips. I stongly recommend you buy this.I gave it a 4 because it's not in English. This IS an english site and I doubt you can all read kanji. Also, the skip throughout the manga skips some important facts, but other than that, this your guide to Inuyasha!"
4,Very customer oriented,"I ordered the candle mystery box & when I received it one of the candles was broken. I emailed the company asking for a replacement of the one candle that was broken. It took a while for them to answer my email, but when they did they told me they would promptly send a replacement. I was very surprised to get not only a replacement candle, but they sent me a whole new mystery box of candles.I would order from them again."
1,Don't Waste Your Time & Money,"You've got other places to spend your money. Don't waste it on this ""Glossary"" of nothing new under the sun. What no one ever tells you about investing in real estate--believe me, you've probably heard it before."
3,Sensible advice overall,"There is nothing here that you do not already know. Yet we know what we need to and still dont often act on it, so this should serve as a good reminder. Its easy to read as you can read the articles in any order. A few themes run across all the articles- that a good life is lived by taking risks every day (as TS Eliot said: Do I dare disturb the universe ?) , that people often forget to be kind in their close relationships, that we limit ourselves in fear of failure.Whether this book will actually change your life or just be another means of keeping busy or escaping the present(without actually risking to apply it in your own life) depends on the reader. I laugh when I read about people gifting it to all their friends. Wisdom cannot be acquired by buying a book, it has to be internalized. But I guess now that M Scott Peck is dead we need a new Guru and this certainly caters to that market.Anyhow, sensible advice overall."
5,great game,This is a really awesome game especially for gamers who want a simplistic roleplaying game. If you dont have anyone else to play with you can buy some solitaire adventures
5,GREAT!,"I ORDERED 2 SETS, ONE FOR MYSELF AND ONE FOR MY SON-LAW, WE ARE WESTERN FANS AND IT IS ONE OF HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENTS"
5,A decent Magnifying Glass,"This was a present to my 7 year old, and I cannot be more than happy to get this product. The product is nicely built, the handle has a good grip, the rim around the glass holds it in a way that the glass will not slip out. I was looking for something inexpensive and just found this to be a perfect match."
1,Not pleased,Ordered these online based on reviews and all the hype. They were a big disappointment - didn't sound like musical instruments at all. Sent them back the same day.
3,Good,"First of all, this video has been shot by professionals and it shows. It gives an excellent idea about what BaGua is. Moreover, although I do not practice BaGua, I believe that it is a good instructional video for practicioners who want to improve their forms. On the other hand, the internal aspects beyond the techniques are neglected, thus making the ChiGung section rather clueless. It cannot be used to learn a little BaGua to supplement other martial arts' studies. I give it three stars mostly because, in my opinion, the price is exceedingly high even considering the high graphic quality."
4,Baritone greatness,I have enjoyed Lou Rawls for more than 30 years. His ability to put character into his music was unmatched.
2,Kakuro for Dummies-I must be a real one.,"I wanted this for Christmas because I enjoy Sudoko and can do some pretty hard puzzles in that arena. They get boring so I thought I'd try out some math related puzzle. ""Kakuro for Dummies"" lets you do a couple you can figure out and goes straight to the hard ones that say they're easy. It took me 3 attempts to get into the book just to figure out the basic scratch and deduct method. I haven't even tried to go get another book; one with pages of easy puzzles. I think I'll just go get work books with algebra problems to solve."
1,amen to previous review--too difficult!,"I thought the ""dummies"" title was just marketing, but this book is out to make the customer feel like one. I've been on a kakuro binge lately, and have enjoyed doing the moderately hard level puzzles in other books, but in this one, I couldn't even do the easiest level."
2,It seems cheaply made,It seemed flimsy and not very well constructed. It did arrive on time and in good shape. I doubt I would order this again.
1,Extremely Boring,"Don't let the title of this book fools you. The pictures inside the book are in poor quality, of course, we can not find any pretty model inside the book."
5,"Nothing negative to say, everything to me is excellent.","Nothing negative to say, everything to me is excellent.It really is an EXCELLENT product, do not know why people are so unhappy, in short all excellent.Nothing is perfect except ""GOD"""
5,Going Home,"Very good movie, a very family friendly Movie!!One of Jason Robards last movies & one of his best!!This is a very heart touching movie!!I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!"
1,[rubbish],"Save your money! Not only does this author not understand what leadership is, his arrogance and inexperience oozes out from the text. Although well written, it's [not reliable]!"
3,make sure you have space!,this probably would work very well. I simply could not get into where my pump inlet is to attach this unit
3,Have to wait and see.,Have not installed this accessory as of yet. Waiting till the Spring. Fairly simple to install no doubt. Should work well.
3,Wrong connections,The main issue I have is that the connections from my pump to this converter dont match. For this year I just hooked up amother connection and hose and did it that way and re-connected the main line hose afterwards. Next year summer I will work on getting the right connection so I can use the converter
4,Helpful; has me thinking about things,"I just bought this book, and it is actually quite helpful. I have never written a game, but am fairly experienced in VB6. I wanted to explore DirectX programming, and this is a good start. As far as other reviews complaining about having to use Truespace, you can also use 3dStudio Max, get the file exporter from Microsoft and you can can create .x files with that. Should also work with Maya, and you can get that for free. I thought the code was well organized, and on my 1.2 ghz machine, I get excellant frame rates. I only wish there was more detail about Direct3d, but still, enough here to get started. I recommend this book if you are an intermediate level VB programmer, and need some ideas on how to program games, if you are new to VB, probably not the best book to get."
2,Needs work,I brought this item when it first came out. Nice unit but it has problems with the USB conectors. I returned it.
2,The Only Reason to Buy This Book,"Is if you want a smut fix. Yes, Asagiri You's a respected mangaka, yes, there's a lot of sex in this, but the story and the characters are just . . . annoying as all git-out. Shun's one of those weepy, whiny ukes and Cain, the self-styled ""Golden Beast"", is about as seductive and menacing as Sebastian Bach. On a bad day. The plot, such as it is, hinges on the ol' dead sibling aspect, except that the sibling's not really dead. In fact, he's alive. And in love with his brother, who's--oh, never mind. And the dialogue? The less said, the better. Which is a maxim I wish the author had followed."
5,WONDERFUL MUSIC,"I bought this because it was so popular the summer I was fourteen. The music took me back all those years to some beautiful memories of a carefree summer. These songs make younger people wonder what the world was like then, which provides for interesting conversation."
5,Great video,"A classic tournament and great to see on video. There aren't too many Tiger videos, and this is one of the best."
2,Advert for their seminars/courses,"This book is heavy on excitment and 'systems' but very light on details. Not something to buy if you want to actually go out and DO something now. This book is mostly intended to get you involved in their very expensive mentoring, coaching, or course programs."
3,Making Big Money Investing in Foreclosures: Without Cash or Credit by Peter Conti,"An official Library Weekly book review.REVIEW:This book generically highlights a few ideas on how to invest inforeclosures and how to finance it without using cash or credit.Part of the formula is the use of ""double closings"" which allowsyou to simply invest with a minimal amount and use the sell priceas the payment during the title closing. The difficult aspect ofthis is it doesn't truly describe certain foreclosure techniquesavailable in each state (generically applied). Additionally,you may need to read this with a grain of salt with the currentreal estate market conditions.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS ON FORECLOSURES:1. The Beginner's Guide to Real Estate Tax Lien and Tax Deed Auctions [ISBN 0978834607]EXCERPT:""There's never a better time to invest in real estate.""RATING:3 of 5"
4,Helping Others in Financial Trouble,"This book really opened my eyes to how investing in foreclosures can be a win - win for both the investor and the seller. It also gave really easy, doable ideas on how to start investing in this niche, a niche that in Chicago and the rest of the midwest is experiencing high growth.If you are serious about getting started in real estate investing, read this book. It gives you the basics and some advanced, yet simple, investing techniques that get you started on the right path."
4,Great Toy!!,"This is a great action , as are MOST of the new star wars toys. She has a fabric skirt, which is neat because most action figures have plastic skirts. Luminara is very movable and an cool character. The other people who complain about durabilty and not being able to hold the weapons, well ask your self what these people are doing with the action figures.If you plan on throwing , stomping, crushing or generaly abusing these figures, or any action figure then yes, it will break. My kids play with these all the time an understand that toys do break. So far we havent had an ""deaths""Great Toys, beutifully made."
3,tarnishes quickly - but I am happy,"I am a very skeptical person, but for some reason (placebo ?) these things do appear to work. I know they are not supposed to...but hey!"
5,I'm telling everyone I know to watch this movie,"This is truly a wonderful piece of entertainment. Guided well by the Coen brothers, John Turturro offers us this gem of a ""home-made musical"" filled with a stunning cast. It's clear these actors had a ball performing and this infects the viewers world.If you enjoy great acting, infectious storytelling, and complete inane seemingly non-sequiturs that take you on a merry-go-round of enjoyment: watch this film."
1,Not worth buying!!!,"I bought this watch from Amazon.com months ago but I have a Timex Ironman that doesn't have an hour/minute hand function. At first it looks cool but once you purchased it then problems starts to pop up. First problem I encountered was the time from the hand seem to be getting late and does not sync with the digital time. Second problem was after adjusting the crown for sometime it fell off. Third problem is, its not ""waterproof"" as they adverstised it to be 100 meters. Water could get inside the watch vessel by just washing your hand in the sink. Bottom line, this is a waste of money and I don't recomend this for you consumers out there it you're thinking of buying this one."
2,Review of Timex Ironman Model #TSE361,I liked the look of the product from the web pictures. Did receive the watch but ended up sending it back when I noticed that the band could not be replaced. I was buying this watch to replace another Timex watch I currently own which I can no longer find a band for. I didn't want to end up with another useless watch without a band. This is the first Timex watch that I've seen that does not allow for a simple band replacement. I hope that this is not a pattern in the design of future Timex watches since I am a big fan of the brand.
4,Great information ....even if you don't agree,"From a research stand point, the book does a great job summarizing Elvis' FBI involvement. Some of the dates that Giorgio provides in the book are very, very hard to find unless you look real deep and many of the documents she summarizes are very hard to read. For those aspects alone, I think the book was worth the purchase.Bottom line is that today's Graceland or Elvis Presley Enterprises want to bury these areas of Elvis' life. This is not the tourist destination, white-washed image they need to market, so in turn, you'll never get the information unless someone tells you where to look.I recommend this book for those with an open mind. If you begin to read with a close-minded point of view, you'll never get what Giorgio is saying or appreciate the amount of work to bring documents to life that would otherwise be buried.I'm not saying that I agree with what Giorgio's conclusions are in the book but for the facts alone, it's a great book to read."
2,Not what I expected,"This is not a night scope but an adapter for a night scope, does not include any directions on how to mount or use it. The picture shows an 'add on' night vision item on top of the adapter - it does not come with it. I'm not sure what this product is for, but night vision doesn't seem to be one of them. Misleading description and somewhat useless product. Note on Vendor - APD doesn't have very friendly support hours and sales people answer the phone as if it is a hassle to talk to you."
3,Best of their Worst,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE the Ozrics, but their early stuff is weak compared to everything on the major labels. This is a good CD for those of us that feel that way as it picks the best of the early cassette tapes and puts it in one place."
4,Perspective made Easy is true,"This book has broken perspective and realistic shadows into some simple steps that build upon the previous steps. There are mathematical formulas that govern perspective drawing, but this book doesn't bog you down into that, and simply shows you the easy way to draw what you see, and not what you think is there."
3,not about camels...,Is it just me or does the cover image look like a camel? Well there is no actual camel info in the book. It might be good for perspective so Im giving it 3 stars but this is a very misleading book.
2,Just one Woman's Thought!,"I did not enjoy this book .... I thought the plot was alluring because it was a unlikely state of affairs, however, I felt the journey to all parties realizing the issue at hand, was much too rapid. You read a few pages then all of a sudden; everyone knows about the predicament, she was moving in to a house with a picket white fence and they were falling in love? I also didn't like that the reference to 'A black chick' was a reoccurring statement. I prefer Black woman... I was unclear as to how Nigel found out [who] his father [was] and what the end result was. Did he say anything about it? Personally I felt it could have been written better."
2,Editing Anyone?,"I think this book could have been a lot better if the editing were done correctly. There were so many typos it was frustrating. I put the book down several times bceause of this not intending to finsh it, but finished none the less so I could find out how it all turned out. The story was a good one but often when mvoing from one scene to another I got lost at who was speaking. That does not happen with a story that is well written. This book was clearly written in a hurry to get it published fast I think. Time should have been taken to make the reading experience worth while."
4,A SWEET SUSPIZE,I read this book 5 years ago and I thought I wrote a review for this book. but I didn't I correct that mistake. It was very interestingly. It had refreshing intake on romance Qiana want to have a baby old-fashion going to sperm bank. Nigel want his cake and eat too but life has a way turning his world upside down. Don't forget all secondary characters with their share of problems. It was crazy insightful wonderful emotional ride. It was good book and I hope one day Ms. Michelle write a sequel about Nigel and Qiana life. What happen after they got married.
3,Good brush for the price,"This brush worked well for the price, but I ended up purchasing another brush that had a soap dispenser built into the handle as well for a duel purpose tool for wash and rinse."
4,Impressive,"This is a most impressive and realistic recreation of the terrifying consequences of this recent natural disaster. This is no maudlin tear jerker, and fortunately does not rely on special effects for its impact.It is simply a very well acted drama which probably even underplays what must have been sheer hell, although that is not to say the film in any way falls short of conveying the true tragedy of the event.It has the even greater merit of having been made for TV, which one does not normally associate with this scale of production. If this interests you, and you missed it on TV, get it on DVD - you won't be sorry."
3,Good for the price..,"The movie was ok, longer then I remember (2 disk) Worth watching if you are a fan of Chiwetel Ejiofor!"
5,All Clad Measuring Cup Set,"I gave this set as a gift to someone just starting out as a new cook. It's a beautiful, well made set."
4,Ashley and Bruce trek South America and journal..,"Ashley and Bruce aka Joe and o traversing Chile and Argentina...good fun, metaphysical musings and insights...All is perfect exactly as it is, all happens for a reason, and the laws of attraction , all addressed 25 years ago...Good minds, fun read."
5,Surviving is the countersign!,"Powerful, haunting and bravery portrait in the middle of the WW2, when by those random' s caprices, a Jewish boy and his father are separated, in times of Nazi invasion. This boy will face to face by himself, day by day the horrors of the War under different perspectives. Fortunately his smartness will allow to build an improvised bunker: a desolated wreck that will work out as an attic. The way he builds the stairway and his undeniable love for his pet ""Snow"" (a sympathetic hamster), and his persuasiveness despite the worse days will earn his own honor 's medal.A worthy picture that deals a matter depicted many times before, but that nevertheless maintains its own artistic integrity."
2,Never received,"I try to have the item, but all that I did was unsuccessful.Miss delivery at the correct address (surveilled 24/7), refund without answer at my question sent via email, answer after refund procedure with a pre-wrote mail very confused and uselessness.I never received this item, and received a less refound than I had paid with my pre payed credit card."
1,No XP Driver!,"This would be a fine printer. It produces lovely prints. The problem? For reasons I cannot fathom, CANON HAS DECIDED *NOT* TO RELEASE A WINDOWS XP DRIVER!! Now that I've upgraded my PC to XP, my Canon is a paperweight."
5,Good product,This mouse really extends the usefullnes of my laptop. It has the resolution that I can move the curser over the full screen by moving the mouse about 2 inches. It also has the radio range of about 5 feet. Nice product
2,Very poor tracking,"I use it with a vaio laptop. The cursor jumps around all over. Very hard to use sometimes. I am typing and I tend to look at my hands and I find when I look up, the cursor has jumped to some other location and I am not at the end of the document. Then I have to move the text. Bad!"
1,It never worked for me.,"I bought this mouse at a Bestbuy store. It never worked for even a second. I went to Bestbuy stores, talked with different sales representatives, and learnt the tricks such as pressing ""connect"" button with the tip of a pen, it still does not work. My old wired MS mouse works much better, and it's shape is much better as well."
3,Wall Mounted hair dryer,"I have had three of these hair dryers, and they last me about two years. I like the convenience of having them on my bathroom wall."
5,buy it,"I have two of those purchased 8 years ago. One of them finally died. I will order another one, same brand."
5,Great Product,We love this product. Very powerful and compact. We have them in our home and summer house. Great product.
2,Not so hot....,"While I love the convenience of this dryer mounted to the wall, which is why I bought it, it lacks power. It is also very, very noisy on the high setting. There was no warranty either. If it wasn't such a hassle, I'd try to return it. It was the cheapest - you get what you pay for sometimes."
2,Short life.....,"We had the dryer for a very short time when the switch would no longer work. It is almost impossible to take apart to repair because of the odd screws, holding it together. We are totally disappointed and just now ordered another brand through Amazon. Hopefully, this one will not be disappointing."
4,not entirely agree...,"I have experience in college teaching myself. There are some important points that the author brought out regarding study methods. However, I must also say that some studying environment that the author mentioned in the book is too ideal. I know of too many average or poor family who can not effort to provide their kids that kind of luxury in terms of attention and physical environment. However, their kids often end up much tougher and successful. My point is that few things that the book considered important is really secondary in my opinion."
2,not very brite,Not as bright as a candle was expecting more than it was might be ok if you bought the color tube but still im not thrilled with my purchase
3,glo toob more like 2.5 than 3 stars,i bought one from think geek via amazon and they charged me full retail.i read the instructions. the different settings are hard to adjust because the twist mechanism needs some waterproof silicone grease or some kind of lubricant in there.when you turn it the metal to metal aluminum grinding can be felt in your fingers.the solid body is cool.when i bought one only blue was available.i wanted green or red.overall its not worth 32.95+shipping.now that i see the price of it slashed i feel hella burned and the manufacturer should send me one free just because how lame the first one was.
4,Great Motherboard,"I've bought two of these and have no complains so far, everything works and its fast. Using it with Intel Q6600 CPU and nVidia 8800GT. I gave 4 stars because price could have been better."
4,Not the best at everything but great for what it is,"Lets face fact if you look at triathelete that person is not going to be the best at each of the disciplines but combined together then that person works out greater then the sum of their parts. Same thing with this. Not the best griller, microwave aint bad and the same for the toaster. But when you put together the sum of all its parts it is a great appliance in that it saves me having 3 appliances on my counter and does everything that it says it does just takes a little longer then an appliance built strictly for it"
1,"Looked great, but...","Bought the microwave because it looked great-retro. BUT, the turntable vibrated and spilled filled coffee mugs BUT since it looked great, only filled them halfway. BUT THEN, it stopped working in 3 months."
2,Frustrated,"So it turns out that if you have a new desktop with new windows the scsi card will not work for this device. So, I don't know how good this device is because seems no one is making new scsi devices. So, I guess that means I have to partition my new PCs hard drive, buy and old windows version to install and hope it works. More money and time. All a waste."
3,Not for iMacs,"This is probably a great film scanner, but you won't be able to use it if you have an iMac. The scanner has a SCSI-2 connection, and even includes a ""Mac adaptor"", but it won't work at all for an iMac. Even if you're tempted to buy that $100+ SCSI-to-USB adaptor, don't bother because the software is incompatible with this particular piece of equipment. I spent hours on the phone with the tech reps from Canon and the adaptor company, but to no avail. (Bummer, dude! I really wanted this film scanner!)."
3,Strange book..,"I started reading this book, and I am puzzled by its style! While the information seems to rely on a huge compilation of data from many books, there is a lot of rather crude QM stuff (ordinary QM and AMO). Its style is rather pretentious, hard to follow, jumping from one thing to another.."
4,love it,love it....so happy amazon kicked this out as a suggestion when i was searching for a sweater dryer could not have found a better product
5,Fits in smaller changing tables,The main reason I bought this pad was it was the smallest I could find. Even though it says 30 x 16 inches it fit nice and snug in our changing table that is about 15 x 29 inches
3,I haven't used it yet...,"This arrived today and I haven't used it yet, but wanted to post a review. A couple other reviewers commented on the non-slip/non-skid bottom being great. Well... They must have reviewed the wrong item, because this is NOT non-slip at all. I bought it to place on the vanity in our master bathroom, and will need to be careful so it doesn't slide (can't secure it to the vanity top, so was really counting on the non-slip).Other than that, this seems nice for the price, I am happy with the 4 sides (another big factor in choosing this changing pad) and happy with the size as we needed a slightly shorter pad."
5,Perfect size & shape,"Our baby's changing table could only accommodate a 30"" long changing pad, so I was glad to find this one. Before ordering, I wasn't sure if I'd like that it was contoured on all 4 sides instead of just the long sides, but I do like it this way. In fact, the contour seems deeper than most changing pads which makes it a little bit safer in my opinion - my daughter is very wiggly! It's very easy to clean when my daughter isn't quite ""done"" when I think she is and there's no diaper under her."
3,Great behind the scenes work,"This is an awesome film about the creative process of a musical genius,however the video quality is a bit sub par."
4,very good. but short,if you are a big fan of john you will like evreything he will ever came up to .. great musician in the d.v.d but i expected for more... too short for me...
2,Very superficial look at computer arithmetic,"Although the author does a good job at explaining arithmetic in the areas of RNS and SD arithmetic, the other topics are done very superficially. The book is a good reference, but you can find better books on understanding computer arithmetic."
4,Great video for packer party... Not Superbowl !,"At first I thought the video I ordered was the Superbowl as stated in the title.... It's not. However, the highlight video and all the behind the scenes are great and I hav no regrets buying it. Will be a great video to play in the background at packers parties next year."
2,left me wanting more,"Huge Packer fan but this dvd left me wanting. I have an old vhs tape of the last Packers superbowl run and in my opinion it is much better. The color was more vibrant and the replays were much better. This whole dvd looked ""washed out"" and most of the replays were from ground level, at times even from behind players. I enjoy seeing the plays develop from up above. Some of the antics by some of the players does provide enjoyment however."
4,The best highlights.,"Great DVD, with all the major highlights from the entire season. A must buy for all Packer fans! Wished it would have been longer, but at 2 hours it hits the highlights from the season and the Super Bowl. There are some nice special features including some of the Super Bowl media day."
4,Great piece of Packer history,"There's nothing like winning the Super Bowl and being able to look back and say we we're the best team. Equally exciting for me though is the journey... and you can't tell the story of this team without talking about the season as a whole. This film did a pretty good job of telling the tale. With jaw dropping highlights that we won't soon forget as well as game after game of heartbreaking defeats in the end. If you're looking for a Hollywood style movie with ups and downs, twists and turns... watch Rudy. If you want to be able 10 years from now to relive this unbelievable season then definitely get this DVD/Blu-ray."
1,terrible,I hate this book. it is the worst book ever created and has no plot or story line. Charles dickens has got to be the worst writer in all of history. I feel that the time i spent reading this book was a waste and i am sorry that i can never get those hours of my life back.
5,great mouse,I got this mouse a few months ago and it works great. It is a good size and shape. The battery life also is good. I would definately recommend this mouse to a notebook user
2,SHORT-LIVED NAVIGATING,"Was in need of a new mouse and after using the basic corded where the cord would be in the way, I thought I'd try a cordless with a reputable name. Was great to program as far as the set up, had good option functions, was smooth for navigating, but over time say a couple of weeks later, the thing would EAT through batteries, the scroll wheel became sticky and the clicks were unresponsive. Was good but not for long...only 2 months ?...sorry Microsoft."
1,NOOO GOOOOOD,"I BUY THIS MOUSE AND IN 20 DAYS STOP GIVE PROM. AND TWO DAYS MORE STOP WORKING , DO NOT LOST MONEY IN THIS IS ."
1,Microsoft B5W-00001 Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse 6000,One of the worst pieces of hardware I've purchased in the past two years.Short on features/functions.Short on range.Suggest buyers consider Logitech.
5,This Mouse Rocks!,"I have always been a fan of Microsoft mice and this mouse continues to confirm my belief. Very easy installation, smooth-as-silk tracking, great horizontal and vertical scrolling. The best notebook mouse ever made!"
1,Doesn't work with Windows 7,Would have been good to know that this product doesn't work with Windows 7 before ordering. Just sayin'.......It would seem like that would be worth mentioning since it is what people still have.
3,"Nice inexpensive mouse, not for gaming.","Overall rating: good. Shipped very quick. No complaints.PRO'S: Very good working mouse, excellent connectivity, works great simply by plugging into a Windows 7 pc, RECOMMENDED for a pc or mac user for ANY purpose OTHER than gaming.CON'S: This is NOT a mouse for gaming! The middle button rolls too smooth and when you scroll through any inventory it is very difficult to select your intended item."
1,"Very poor quality, stopped working after three days","This product was reasonably easy to install (both devices, it comes with a ""free"" wireless keyboard).Both mouse and keyboard are very comfortable, although keyboard letters require young eyes and good lighting.Mouse stopped responding properly at day three, we had to click three to five times to initiate computer responce.Keyboard followed two days later.I connected my old wired Dell keyboard and mouse but I had to manually uninstall both devices from within Control pannel because my computer kept looking for those more advanced devices.Company promissed a replacement but never shipped one.Shipping damaged goods back with provided RMA (works for 14 days only)costs almost as much as I payed for it.Putting em in a trash was an easier option."
3,HOW TO STOP THE ANNOYING BEEP!!!,"This product is great if you know how to turn off the freeze warning... why they put it on there I have NO idea. I gave this product three stars because I had to look up these instructions, I should have to hunt all over for these and neither should you.These are instructions I found off the company's website.To deactivate the freeze alarm on the RAR381/681 and the RMR382/682, you will need to set the remote sensor to Channel 2 or 3. The freeze alarm does not work on channel 2 or 3.1) Remove the cover from the remote sensor and locate the channel switch (see item 6 on the figure below).2) Slide the channel switch to channel 2 or 3.3) Depress the reset button with a paperclip or pen (see item 5 on the figure below).4) Slide the battery cover back on."
3,Over priced All-Clad Stainless measuring spoons,"I admit I didn't need any more measuring spoons, but the old aluminum ones were all bent and the mismatched plastic ones from different sets broke. The All-Clad spoon handles feel great in the hand and the balance is perfect. However, being made overseas for the amount All-Clad over-charges is gouging. (For the count, if All-Clad is paying attention, I too am sorry to see that these were made in other than the U.S.) There are other measuring spoons just as nice, for less, although also made overseas. I would have been fine with the price had they been manufactured in the U.S."
3,Expensive Chinese Spoons,"Just in case you were wondering if All-Clad was outsourcing its merchandise, it is. These measuring spoons are made in China. Now that's some expensive stainless steel."
1,A waste of money,"I bought this as a replacement for a slightly older Microsoft wireless keyboard that was stolen. The other board/mouse used bluetooth, and was great. This one uses a different system with a long cord & reciever unit, as opposed to a small plug in USB.My main complaint is that it frequently drops a letter or number here and there. This would not be a big problem if you are writing a letter to your Aunt Margie, but if you are entering financial data, it is a very big deal.Varying the distance from the reciever to the board makes no difference. Ditto with fresh batteries, even Duracells.There are plenty of other good board out there, so do not waste your time on this one."
1,Not Recommended,"I wish that I had read some of the reviews here before buying this product. The big problem is the left mouse button which only works part of the time. Quite often I will have to click the mouse 4 or 5 times before an action takes place. Sometimes performing a left click will cause whatever I'm looking at to scroll very quickly. Since I use the left click all of the time, this is unacceptable. The problem didn't start until about a week after I purchased the product. The mouse movement is fine, the scroll-wheel works, but doesn't have a good feel.I don't not recommend this mouse and keyboard."
2,Downed in the Flood,"Baez takes her pompous attitude to the greatest extremes by trying (and failing) to perform some of Dylan's greatest songs. ""Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands"" is not a song that was meant to be covered, especially by the like of Ms Baez. Although I respect and appreciate her position in the heirarchy of folk singers, on this compilation, she it clearly taking her association with Dylan to the furthest level of pomposity and arrogance by attempting to cover such songs as ""Sad Eyed Lady"" and ""Love Minus Zero/No Limit""."
4,Great Basic Makeup Tips,I would recommend this book to beginner makeup artist or for oneself. I read it from front to back and it gives you a lot of insite and gives you a great place to start especially if you are working on other people. The pictures are great.
5,Very good book,I carry this book with me when I do a consultation with clients. Very good book with great photos.
1,THIS BOOK IS EHHHH,I thought this book had step by step application but it didn't. I hate that they edited all the photos. It was so fake. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO ALREADY KNEW THE BASICS OF MAKE-UP! For beginners it still wasn't good
3,Pictures are not realistic,"I like this book. It's very informative, but I don't like the pictures of the models. They are obviously edited (look airbrushed) and I think there should have been unedited pictures so we could see what the make up would actually look like in real life."
4,Great book but I guess I was expecting....,It has great information on formula types. Great application tips. Beautiful pictures of his before and afters. I guess I was expecting something more straight forward that instructed you on how to achieve a makeover. he amount of makeup suggested by him to apply would make me feel as if I was wearing a mask. Not really a great look for everyday...
4,So informative,I love how this book broke it down. I just wish it would have given you more of a step by step look at how to look like the amazing women in the book.
5,great book,I got this book to learn new techniques and ways to make gorgeous makeup. I ended up already knowing all the techniques but it should be great for someone who doesn't know a lot alrleady
3,"Nice, but sync problem","Nice watch, but Timex should have made it so that the analog and digital sections stay synchronized together. You have to reset one or the other every few days if you want them in sync.I have a Casio watch that was half the price that keeps analog and digital in sync automatically."
2,Band problem,I bought it about 6 months ago and the band is broken now. I am a thought guy but I bought it thinking that an ironman was made for that for thought guys... Not this watch or at least not this band as it is one peace only and can not be replaced... what a waste!
4,Over all a very good book for the aspiring writer.,"Graves new book, Bring Life into Learning, is written from the point of view of one who's been there. We've all had creative writing courses that followed such a structured curriculum that they might as well have left the word ""creative"" out of the course description. I particularly liked his human approach to writing. Writing begins as thought. We don't think in perfect sentences and paragraphs. We can't be expected to write like that either. The only disappointment I had with his book was chapter 9, Let the Arts Lead. Since I am a music teacher I got excited, until I realized he omitted the performing arts. Children sing and dance long before they write. I would like to see the chapter re-titled. Otherwise the book is excellent and I would strongly recommend it."
2,Do not buy for kayaking if you are female,This is a well made life vest and comfortable (my boyfriend tried it on and liked it a lot) but if you are female and looking to paddle (kayaking especially)- you are going to have problems. The straps are only adjustable on the side and sewn onto the front- forcing the bulk of the vest to rest on top and in front of your chest. This made it very uncomfortable (and somewhat difficult) to paddle properly. I would not purchase this particular life vest if you are looking to use it primarily while canoeing or kayaking.
3,Arrived okay,Haven't used it but it seems okay.13 more words - 13 more words - 13 more words - 13 more words
3,Gets the job done as an extra vest.,"Good for emergencies and as use as an affordable spare/extra vest. Not something you'd want as a primary vest, especially for heavy use or active skiers."
3,"Acceptable but a bit small, Not tested inside water yet","Bought this a week ago, have not tested it in water, however its a bit smaller than you would expect. Im 5,8 170lbs and looks a bit small.It did have a couple little holes inside the vest, I dont knw if they are for draining or just a deffect.I got two just to be legal in my kayak, so for the price its acceptable."
3,It could be better.,Because this harness is one-size-fits-all it's really loose and you can't make the straps stay connected at all. It kept falling off my dog!
1,Flimsy and ineffective,"We bought this product to try and teach our 65 pound, 7 month old dog not to jump our fence. It failed miserably. First, though the instructions and illustrations make it look easy to put the harness on the dog, it is not easy. The straps all look alike and the buckles are interchangeable. When we finally got the harness on and fitted properly, our dog chewed the straps to pieces in only minutes. The webbing straps are flimsy and thin, and would probably not have restrained our dog even had she not destroyed the harness. Don't waste your money."
1,Didn't work for my dog,"I have an Irish setter that can jump four foot fences in one leap and climbs six foot fences and where I live there is a law about not having dogs on tie outs. My dogs is housebroke but when she does go out she escapes. I was told by the Irish setter rescue to get one of these no jump harnesses, that it not only prevents dogs from jumping up but from jumping over fences.Well, it is not easy to get on a dog that moves and took almost an hour. Then I let her out to watch and well, she tried to jump the first time and stumbled so she walked around the yard a few times, took off at high speed and flew over the fence with no problem at all.Also, the harness keeps sliding over to one side, it doesn't stay like the picture shows. I thought maybe it wasn't on right so I rechecked and it was on according to the directions.Maybe it works for some but not for my very determined Irish Setter."
2,"Good Concept, but...","I purchased the No Jump Harness by Classic Products. The concept is great, but it is so complicated to get on. It took 20 minutes to wrestle the thing on and everyone got frustrated, including the dog. By the time we finally got the contraption on, the dog just sat there and wouldn't move. The B clip malfunctioned and won't stay closed. The straps are way too narrow and flimsy for a very large dog. When we finally dragged him outside, he walked a little then saw the dangling straps flapping in the breeze and then chewed on them as though they were a toy. Does someone else have a better suggestion? Maybe one designed for specific breeds or wider - sturdier straps?"
1,Big Disappointment!,"This toy does not work at all as advertised. You can put in UNDER the warm bath water and it turns yellow - take it out to start drawing on it, and it cool too fast and turns all green. Even if you try to draw ""real fast"" the ice melting in the drawing tool very quickly. I am very disappointed with this toy and would not recommend it to anyone. My too children were frustrated that even I could not make it work."
2,Gone Without a Trace,"This toy does not work well. First, the drawing board must be hot/warm for it to work, and the drawing ball must be ICE cold. However, the board does not stay warm enough and the ball does not stay cold enough. For example, we soaked the pad in hot water for a few minutes to warm it up. When my daughter began to draw on it, the lines would disappear within seconds. Also, splatter marks and lines appeared everywhere water dripped."
5,"WHETHER YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP, OR JUST DATING--BUY IT!!!!","The book didn't just contain great food ideas for two, it was very well written, clever, funny, sexy, and it makes your imagination and appetite take over and run wild. Author Diane Brown takes you on a rollercoaster ride of sights, tastes, and smells that appeal to ALL your senses. Recipes are pretty easy to make and turn out fabulous, even if you're just an amateur chef. Dining in has always been more romantic. Now it's a little easier to seduce that special someone!"
4,Brilliant or Schlock?,"It's hard to appreciate Alex Chilton's Clichés if all the listener is seeking is a rememberence of the power-pop melodies of Big Star. You ain't gonna find that here. But Chilton strangely reverts back to his soulful youth, covering jazz and soul classics with a soft leathery voice that still makes your bones tingle. He accomplishes no small feat, giving the listener something he doesn't want to hear (""Dammit, where's Don't Lie To Me???"") but still putting a smile on their face. This is truly wonderful music. Great chill-out tunes for when you're alone."
3,Solid But Dated,"Written in 2000, this book demonstrates what a decade does to sully scholarly work. There is a lot of great (dated) information here for students and researchers to get a snapshot of Central Asia just after the fall of the USSR and before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The insights are sound and relevant, especially in the cases of the autocrat families choke-holding onto power in the 'Stans. However, the What-if predictions are moot after all the hubbub in the region. The introductory chapter was outstanding for its cold, realist view that the world doesn't always change for the better, despite best intentions from outside nations -- Afghanistan being a testament to that sentiment."
1,Bad Writing Contest Winner,"This should win the Bad Writing Contest. Pretentious, self-conscious -- so bad it's funny."
4,Effective,This pedicure set does what I expected it to do. The batteries are difficult to get in and out but the product works well. A good value for the price.
3,Good for what it is.,"This is a cheap product, but does work reasonably well.That said, after buying this, I then purchased the 'Tweezerman Callus Shaver & Rasp' and 'FootSmart Pedicure Set'. Since I purchased these other Amazon items, the Jerdon Perismooth hasn't been used once.This product smooths, and will improve hardened/rough skin, but it's not enough to get to fresh smooth skin. Best as part of a larger arsenal of pedicure equipment."
1,"Just didn't work, at all","There's not much you can say about this product except that it doesn't work. I put the batteries in(you really have to shove them in there). The battery cover doesn't even close all the way. You turn it on and as soon as you touch anything to the sandpaper the machine stops as if it had no power. Just a bad product. Some people give it good reviews, maybe there is a bunch of defective ones out there and I got one of those, but enough people complain that they got a bad one, so maybe it isn't worth trying. Pretty sad."
3,Works as expected but...,"It's a tight fit in our shower space, but it works as expected and allows me to air-dry several articles of clothing at one time. My main issue is that only 2-3 sweaters will fit across the top at one time (we have *many* lay-flat-to-dry items), and based on the design of this product, I cannot use other hanging dryers at the same time (I wish there was an option to go vertical with this!). In addition, I've noticed the mesh is starting to sag a bit in the middle; but it's still usable.As other reviews warn, be careful when opening this from its collapsed storage position. It springs open rather quickly and can hit someone (say, a little kid, a pet or spouse) who is standing too close (yourself included). I usually toss the product away from me to open it. :)"
3,Awkward,"Not sure what I expected, but this is not it:-)I'm using it and it's OK but I wouldn't re-order it."
5,Kirton's Approach Make Sense,"This was purchased as a text for a course on creativity and problem solving. Kirton's main premise is that we are ALL creative, just in different ways. Worth reading even if you don't have to take a course on problem solving."
3,Very focused - but perhaps too much so,This is an excellent scholarly resource for those with a keen interest in Kriton's Adaption-Innovation thoery and measure. The main criticism is that the book takes way too many liberties with the work of other scholars - and it seems that the main reason for many of the distortions is to try to make Kirton's theory even more acceptable. It is a useful theory without needing to go to those lenghts.
5,Excellent tip,"You receive exact what yo order for, and it is automatic so you don't have to care about the capacity. Excellent item."
3,"GREAT SERIES, NOT GREAT QUALITY!","This is our favorite TV series ever. It's a shame, because the discs have flaws. We had 2 discs that wouldn't play right at all. And when I went back to replay the series, the first disc went bad too. Whatever happened to quality control?"
4,Great gift,"Bought this as a gift for my mom, she loved the series when it was originally on TV.This is the complete series and includes the movies.I would recommend this to anyone!"
1,Great show... BUT...,I wanted to submit this as more of a warning. The show is great... however the discs I got were faulty. The audio does not match up with the video. Please check your discs to make sure that they are correct.
5,Best Family Series Based on Love and Truth,"The best ever dvd series! The first time I watched the re-run of this series, I know I wanted to see the complete series from the beginning to the end. I wished this series never ended. So I searched for it and I found it through Amazon and it was the best deal ever. This series has family values based on love and truth. God Bless!"
5,Love It,"Great Price, new in box. I have never seen the first episodes on television, you always see the episodes come on, but never in order."
3,What's happening with the Complete Series?,"I just rec'd The Complete Medicine Woman Series, which I ordered for a gift at Thanksgiving. However, I am holding it until Christmas, because I am concerned with a ""Flagged"" notice on Amazon about this DVD set. When I called Amazon, they told me it's with disk 28, skipping. If this is the case, Amazon should have had the notice up prior to my ordering or during, or simply inserted a ""new"" copy of disk #28 without me having to find out by surprise after the delivery came. Has anyone recently purchased this series, and had a chance to watch it? I do not know if I should be returning without opening, or ""wait"" until Xmas, but then what happens when I want to return the disk and the package has been opened?? NOt a good feeling. Your help appreciated. The rating I gave was necessary for me to provide this note to you. Without something ""stared,"" I was not able to post.Thank you."
2,Navigational info,"The videotape I received was of poor quality (sound mostly). Although much of the dead reckoning navigation was very helpful, I found they went too fast in some areas, too slow in others. The delivery was very matter of fact. A more interesting delivery would have helped. I found sailing books more informative likeYour First Sailboat : How to Find and Sail the Right Boat for You. That is at least a great place to start for beginners."
4,Bat*21 Score: Hauntingly brilliant.,"I'd seen the movie Bat*21 back in 1988 when it first aired in cinema's, and since then have found myself quite fond of the music that helped make that movie.Christopher Young has made magic with this score, it was very true to the themes of the film, and allowed the film to have more essence. I have found the music to have a rather haunting effect, as long after you've listened to the music, it's still very much with you. Bravo on an excellent score!!"
3,Not quite what was expected,"I bought this book thinking it'd be more or less an encyclopedia of natural pain relief methods... aromatherapy, massage, homeopathy, reflexology, etc. To a certain extent, it was, but the first 40+ pages simply repeated the same message, stated as a fact: Labor is going to be absolutely the most horrible, excruciating pain you've ever had. I was put off by this for a couple of reasons. First, a paragraph would have sufficed, not half the book. And second, if I had read this book before I had my first baby, I'd have been scared out of my mind, and that fear would have made things worse! I just had my second baby, (both born naturally), and neither labor was ""excruciating"".There are a few worthwhile chapters, if you're looking for essential oils that specifically benefit labor or listings of homeopathic remedies and so on, but they aren't as thorough as they could be."
2,Not for self study,As I'm taking the CAE test as and alot of the writing tasks are unfamiliar for me I hoped this book would be of great assistance. Unfortunately it provides mostly questions which you are supposed to answer with your colleague in class. For self-study it is easier to do Google searches as this book mostly gives vague advice.
5,Jane & the Sneaky DOM - Hannah Murray,"What a wickedly delightful read!Jane is a successful bookstore owner, but lately her sex life is a dud. What used to work for her just doesn't anymore and she's not sure why. So when her best friends suggest that maybe she needs to break away from her usual patterns, Jane decides to give it a go.Ian can't believe his luck. Talk about being in the right place at the right time. So this gorgeous woman thinks she might like to try a little bondage? He's her man.I enjoyed the way author kept the playfulness in the incredibly hot sex scenes. If you like light BDSM, but are turned off by thoughts of pain and extreme submission, then you should really give this book a try. This really was about what turned the two of them on while still concentrating on the growing relationship, respect, and trust between the two.I'll be looking for more by this author."
4,Interesting information,"While information is pretty much free on the internet, not all of it is useful. The information in this book is a little eye-opening for those who have any interest in this area. I have not used the information in this book yet. When my wife and I are ready to buy a home, hopefully we can go this route and buy a diamond in the rough."
4,Interesting,I liked how the author brought out the history of Mata Hari through another individual. It rather made Mata Hari more personalized.
1,"Product is good, tubes are garbage!","This is my third attempt to use Phenoseal. What you can get out of the package is good. The problem is that the tubes always end up blowing out the back. Even the little dispoable tube exploded on the ""sealed"" end. Terrible product quality in my opinion. If the package doesn't work then it does not matter what's in the tube."
1,Item is no longer being manufactured,"This item is no longer being manufactured -- Do not buy it! I can't understand why Amazon is still offering this for sale. I attempted to purchase this for a wedding in October 2006. The item arrived broken because it had not been packaged properly. I returned the broken dishes and was told I would receive a replacement by November 22, 2006. I finally called Amazon in mid-December to ask where my replacement was. I was told it would arrive by December 28, 2006 (although they never updated the estimated arrival date on my account page). I finally canceled the order and received a refund in late March 2007. Obviously this item is not available. Why is it still for sale?"
2,The Confessional,This book was boring. Too much Church and God in it for an erotica. The sex was not well done at all. The book was at times hard to follow and I found myself skipping pages. I would not recommend it at all. There are so many out there that are so much better.
2,A little disappointed,I was a little disappointed with this bag. The denim is basically denim colored material. It isn't thick denim like you think of as a pair of jeans. The drawstring is quite skinny too and when you fill the bag you would think the drawstring would be made of thicker material. Just not as durable as I had hoped.
1,Unimpressed,"Mediocre at best, and what sort of unhappy cover of Roxette's 'Listen To Your Heart' have they wrought? The girl is no match for Marie Fredrikkson and the result is disappointing. Here's hoping the radio stations grow tired of the single as fast as I did."
1,Sorry but this isn't Roxette,At first I was very happy to hear something from Roxette. But then I heard this garbage. Sorry but Listen to your Heart is one of the best songs and Roxette was is and will be the best group ever. We don't need such a cover we need the original.
5,I Love D.H.T.!,"This CD is amazing. If you like Ace of Base, you will like D.H.T. The whole time I was listening to it, I thought it sounded like a new Ace of Base CD! This is a must buy!"
2,Automotive,This book is a very general account of antilock braking systems. A lot of the information in the book relates to older systems. Not a lot of info of current systems after 1990.
3,older edition,Manual was produced before the system in my 2000 F150. Did not include the system installed in my 4 wheel antilock vehicle.
3,It touch a cord,Some of the poems touch a cord. I felt almost sorry for the person in these poems and then I felt dread and someone longing for what another has and happiness in some light. It was a well written book
1,Buyer beware! Extremely heavy edits!,"This is a heads-up to anyone wanting to purchase this DVD. I just read an online review which states that only FIVE original songs out of 50 are on this set. That's right -- 45 out of 50 of the original songs are replaced with generic music. The reviewer also states that the video quality is inferior. I'd think long and hard about purchasing this, and would shoot off a note to the studio complaining about it."
1,unhappy days,"nothing i can relate here will really be anything new...i just wanted to do my part in sending the greedy corporate vampires (a class of people truly disconnected from human reality, and totally unfamiliar with the true meaning of ""work"") responsible for this unforgivable fiasco the nearly unanimous message of complete and utter dissatisfaction with their horrendous, butchered product. poor video. edited credits. crappy, generic ""clip art"" music. i will be trading in this heap of unexcusable rubbish for credit toward my purchase of odd couple season 2. if paramount has set themselves out on a mission to ensure that certain among us will go out of their way to avoid buying their products, they are doing a fine, fine job. thanks for the bait-and-switch, paramount, and by the way...fu** you, and the horse you rode in on. really."
2,Very Dissapointed,"Wow, what a dissapointment. I knew I was in trouble when I popped on the first show and found no ""Rock Around The Clock"" in the opening credits.All the ""oldies"" have been removed from the soundtrack, and the picture itself looks like it was recorded from TV Land reruns. If it were not for the fact that all the episodes are complete and unedited, I would believe it. The picture is that poor compared to the great quality of season 1. This should all have been advertised before these sets went on sale. If they were too cheap to spring for the music rights to the songs, the set should have been offered at a reduced price. ""Happy Days"" without the original music is like watching ""Cheers"" without the beer."
3,The same thing was done with the WKRP sets,"Yep, from what I've been hearing & reading, they've done the same thing with the ""Altered Music"" on the ""WKRP"" set's, added different music due to licenseing."
5,"WHILE PASSING THROUGH, BY BEV-E","This book is off the chain. Totally open, honest, and just raw with a girl-child's hurt, pain, and her recovery from what was done to her person, her spirit, her entire life. This book is used amongst incest and molestation survivor's in treatment. I purchased this to understand what happens to the survivor afterward. So many never heal, never recover. My salute to all that seek and utilize therapeutic counseling of any kind and DEAL WITH RECLAIMING THEIR LIVES! Very heartrending, as such stories of horrendous abuse are. Praise God that Bev-E survived and told the tale, for the recovery of others."
5,saw it back in the 90s..,it was 1st on fox local station here & it ran a whole week & i did tape it but that copy wore-out & i just thnkfull enuff that i found all the episodes here on amazon so i can watch again..
2,"Guys like maps, gals like directions.","Sorry to be a sexist pig. I just need to visualize the words. This dawned on me as I began to study with the CD alone. (Retention=zero!).If you are a visual person, use anything but this. Some men really ""don't listen"".Probably would have rated it one star, but others have far less difficulty learning in this way. Women seem to learn much more quickly using auditory methods."
3,Nothing New,"I first bought this dictionary in 1990 for a college course. It was well worth the money. So, I decided to buy a newer version since mine was old and frayed. Upon inspection, I noticed that my old dictionary and this ""new"" dictionary were identical page-for-page. Bottom-line: only buy this book if (a) you don't already have a copy or (b) your copy is falling apart. Otherwise, buy another dictionary."
4,Bantam italian english dictionary,It serves me well. it arrived just in time. i use it often for class. i couldnt have chosen anything else
3,wish there were more for the money,"this is a really good workout, but it is short and I wished there had been at least one additional workout included on the DVD for the $$. Also the extras that were on the DVD weren't really useful to me."
4,Live perennial geraniums,Very nice plants that were secured in shipping container without any damage.Size of plants are perfect for planting. Have bought from this seller before andalways satisfied with purchases. I would not hesitate to buy any plant from this seller.
4,Marty the best,As a fan of Marty Robins more so in my later years than when I listened to him when the songs were new HE had a great voice and funny personalty can't get enough of him THANKS
4,"An oldie, but my favorite nonetheless","I own all of the ""Raviana"" dvds. Out of all of them, this one is the one I reach for most. I do the ""warm up and open up"" section (about 32 minutes) at least once a week. It's perfect...not too tough, not too long. Good breath meditation at the beginning.Frankly, I can't remember the last time I did the other 3 sections...I'm sure they are great. But Warm up and Open up is my ""go to K Yoga workout"".Highly recommended."
4,A must-read for young directors,"If there are directors out there who are at all interested in directing straight plays and especially the works of Beckett, Pinter and the other absurdist, you really ought to listen to what the highly esteemed Alan S. has to say about his experiences. Perhaps more valuable than any text book on directing. I refer back to this book whenever I am preparing an avant garde or post modern play."
4,Feverish,"Feverish, urgent blues and R&B vocals from the Baltimore-based chanteuse and a crack session band. Cathy's got some great chops and a good sense of material. A steamy experience."
1,Horrible Book - Especially for Beginners,"I bought this book for a school project for a master's level software enginnering class. I have an undergraduate CS degree and have done my fair share of programming but since I do not have any experience with VBA or with Access I thought ""Access 2002 Programming by Example"" would be the perfect book. Was I wrong. This is a horrible book. Yes the book is splattered with numeours coding examples but I couldn't make heads or tails out of what the book was trying to explain or what feature or technique the author was trying to highlight. I learned more by just playing around with Access than I did from following the book. So now I'm on the hunt for another book to help me with my programming project. I hope that Bob Villareal's students at Tulsa Community College fair better with this book that I did."
4,ONE GIANT FAULT OF WHICH TO BE AWARE,"I have just ordered this book. I had not done so previously because I have the first edition of this book written under a different title in about 1983. That is a wonderful book for the western fan and is a ""must-own"" in my opinion. However, one VERY SIGNIFICANT FAULT in that book is the fact that the author included an extremely high number of spoilers in the synopsis of most of the films. Why he would do that I cannot understand. But, be aware, if you do not want to read spoilers than do not read the thumbnail sketch of each film's plot before you view the film or you may be disappointed. I am hoping that the author did not repeat this stupid mistake in this new edition of the book. Otherwise I cannot say enough good things about the earlier edition."
3,Not that awesome,"I was under the impression that this product would surprise and impress me for the money and size. I was wrong. It really is cheap, boring, and childish. I shouldn't have expected much but everyone else seemed pretty amped that had purchased one. Its loud. The effect is small, takes up a square foot of wall space, and the design looks like the one from that kids toy where you put a pen in a hole and swirl it around, making a design. I will use it, its not worthless. Just don't expect much."
3,WORKS WELL FOR WHAT IT IS,IT WORKS WELL FOR WHAT IT IS ITS A LOW POWER LAZER LIGHTUSES 3 AAA BATERIES ONE COLOR LIGHT RED THERE IS NOT MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT IT PERHAPS IN A DARK ROOM WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE FOR IT TO WORK REMEMBER ITS A NOT TO BRIGHT LAZER LIGHTRED IT SPINS MAKES DIFFERANT SHAPES AND YOU PROBABLYWILL NOT REPLACE THE BATTERIES FOR A LONG TIME WATCH OUT THAT YOU DONT FALL DOWN IN THE DARK ROOM AND WATCH OUT THAT THE LAZER DONT LET IT HIT YOUR EYES ITS A TOY AT BEST THE PRICE WAS CHEEP ITS ONE OF THOES MUST HAVE DUST COLLECTOR THAT YOU MAYFORGET YOU HAD IN TIME YES A BORING RED LOWPOWER LAZER BUTGOOD FOR WHAT IT IS A TOY I THINK I WOULD NOT GIVE IT TO A CHILDDO TO ITS A LOW POWER LAZER RED IT COULDS BE CONVERTEDTO RUN ON 4.5 VOLTS DC/AC CONVERTER BUT THATS ANOTHER STORYTHEN HOW LONG WOULD IT LAST BEFORE IT BURNS OUTTHESE QUESTIONS ARE OF COURSE UNKNOWN
3,"Solid construction, but not a phenomenal performer","Bought this because I needed a sharp bread knife and it matched the knife block set I have. It's a solid chunk of metal (particularly for a bread knife), but it's not as sharp as it could/should be. Sharp enough to draw blood if you graze your hand, but not sharp enough to cleanly cut through a soft bread roll with enough surety that you don't accidentally graze your hand. Not that I would ever be so foolish as to try cutting something while holding it in my hand. If I had it to do over, I would go with the Victorinox 47547"
3,Black Mountain,"It just does not make sense that the ""bad guys"" plan went so wrong and out of control. They had actually captured there benefactor and were about to ""do him in"". Where's the motive? Ok! At times the writing is good and the locale presents a strong back drop to the story. But overall, the hero is just standard ""variety"" and his ""girl Friday"" proves to be resourceful but very typical. Standard mystery except for locale."
4,This Book Offers a Quick Tour of New York City,"The problem with this book is, there's not enough of it. There are a few major sites included, but I kept wishing there was more to it. What is here is gorgeous, there's just not enough. I have a Pop-Up book Collection. I added this years ago, then bought it again so that my neice who does not live in the city could take a short tour. I love the Rockefeller Center scene as well as the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Maybe one day, they'll make a follow-up. I recommend it to Pop-Up book collectors and those who love New York."
5,Beautiful,"A wonderful pop-up book of New York's best Christmas locations. As a life-long New Yorker, I really appreciated the details of each pop-up illustration. I will have this on my coffee table every holiday season from now on"
2,keep looking...,"This phone has a horrible sound quality - it is always hissing and fuzzy. The features are all pretty nice, except you can't get the phone book to go in alphabetical order - it is all in the random order you put the numbers in which is very inconvenient. The caller id was great, but the little screen-cover kept flopping off as soon as I started using the phone. I am returning this phone today!"
1,Horrible sound quality,All I can say is that the phone has horrible sound quality and it is annoying to talk on it. Lots of crackles and hissing. I would highly recommend NOT buying this phone.
3,Not what I was hoping for,"To be honest, I didn't read the book - I skimmed through, but enough to find that there aren't really any stories that give examples of teens who have prayed, and made a big difference because of it. The content that I saw was good and solid, but in my experience as a youth pastor, I see something with real-life stories as a lot more effective with teens."
3,Cool .... but ....,I was left feeling cheated by this movie. I sequel to this would likely answer all the questions that you will be left with. What happened to ??? Where are they in their lives?
2,I Liked It Okay But It Was Kind of Boring,"I took time out from playing vidio games to watch this DVD that I saw laying in the family room. There's one show called Nightmare at 20,000 Feet. The scary parts are not all that scary, and a lot of it doesn't have nearly enough action. I didn't understand the show about the bookworm but I mostly hate school anyway. One show showed an airplane. It wasin another time zone. It didn't land there but it went there. It was okay but not enough special effects to keep my attention. My favorite show here was about the monsters on Maple Street. There was a lot of good shooting, and some blood."
1,Frozen in Time,"I purchased this book for my 84 year old mother who lost her brother in this horrific plane crash. He was not a member of the Olympic Ice skating team , but was the head steward on board the flight. The 50th anniversary just passed and my mother requested a book written in english about the flight. Thank goodness I reviewed the book first before giving it to her. It is from an American perspective and focuses solely on the individuals of the Olympic team. The crew members and others who also lost their lives were mentioned as an after thought, essentially dehumanizing the effect this tragedy has had on our families. Sadly my Uncles name was grossly misspelled. If my Mom had read that, she would have been devastated. I'm returning the book. My Uncle left a young wife and 4 young daughters at the time of his death. My mother still has the tie he wore, burnt and singed along with other personal objects."
5,Legitimate. Not like the many correspondence hypnotherapy scams.,"Richard's stuff is credible. A REAL course, not the baloney out there. The only complaint that I have is his cerfiticates that you earn are really, really cheezy looking. Totally inappropriate to hang on the wall with any credibility. Why he couldn't just charge $20 for a nice certificate is beyond me. The certificates he sends out are hoakie considering the course work is rigorous and thorough. I give him an A for the course though!"
2,Good soundtrack but not complete without the end title,"The movie actually is one of my favorites & that time I watched it,at the end I heard 1 of the best end titles I'd ever heard before.Ya ""Shape of my heart"" from Sting.I got the soundtracks just for this song & I saw what the hell its not in the CD!!!3 stars for the the CD 5 stars for the song..."
5,This Game Rocks!,"This is a great game for the money! Multiple race tracks and nothing but MUSTANGS, MUSTANGS, MUSTANGS! You can select from a vast array of Mustangs and the more you play and win the more cars you can unlock. The tracks are detailed as are the cars (you can even select different colors) and you can choose between a guick race or start career mode that let's you win more cars and unlock more tracks. The only drawback is the background music is pretty lame, but for 20 bucks or less you get a lot of bang for your buck!"
1,Another piece of crap,Cult movie yeah right this is a failed attempt to make a new monster movie in the 70s. Pass this title by...
1,this toy really stinks,Paint doesnt load or expel easily...waste of money and time...my daughter is happier with a bucket of plain water and a brush
1,Worst movie EVER,"This was an awful, awful movie. Just terrible. Boring, not funny, and lacked plot. Also, Meg Ryan's face is scary and unnatural. Maybe she can play the joker in the next Batman movie."
3,Surprise of a movie,"I bought this movie not expecting much, even though the scenes looked funny. It turned out to be a very decent flick with both laughs and some action scenes. It was well worth the money I paid for it and was definitely worth watching.You see previews of many movies which make them look great, but these scenes turn out to be the only good ones in the entire film. This was not the case with this movie. It really was a good watch and the end really surprised me.You should absolutely give this one a try."
2,you'd expect much better from this cast,"It turns out Meg Ryan is still acting in movies and for this movie she drags Antonio Banderas down. Banderas is delightful as a charming con artist who falls in love with Ryan, who has recently made a fortune on stocks and lost a ton of weight (a very unimaginative fatsuit). The movie is not only degrading to fat women but it also makes fun of just about anyone else. That wouldn't be problematic if it was done well, but unfortunately it is not. There are moments that are still funny and the actors make the best of the script, but for a movie with a lot of promise, this movie fails miserably. Additionally, it's a shame than Colin Hanks (Tom's son) and Selma Blair are underused."
4,Entertaining romantic comedy,"I saw a preview of this movie when I was watching another DVD and I had to see it. I like Meg Ryan and I miss seeing her in films nowadays. What's wrong with Hollywood not utilizing a great comedic actor like her? I've heard several female actors say Hollywood loses interest in them when they age but come on, this is ridiculous. A woman really starts getting interesting and comes into her own beauty after 40 in my opinion. Okay, I'm off my soapbox. This comedy made me laugh out loud and I could really identify with Meg's character who went from over two hundred pounds to fit and healthy and really started living her life fully. Antonio Banderas is wonderful as always as her new boyfriend who may or may not be an international art thief. All of the supporting cast was fabulous too. Enrico, the Italian chef whom Marti (Meg's character) broke up with was hilarious as the spurned lover who just can't let go."
2,Still wondering who this film was actually made for....,"I have to agree with what the other one and two star reviews have said; it goes so far overboard trying to pack so many interviews into a relatively short period that any real message is lost. It would seem that this film was made by the ASC for the ASC, with the sole intent of seeing how many accomplished cinematographers could be interviewed. Presumably, the subject of style was supposed to be explored, hopefully showing how great cinematographers translated story into visual language. That didn't really happen. It was loosely touched upon in a series of extremely short snippets that altogether lacked substance. Bummer. Nice looking interviews though."
4,Fantastic Book,"I read ""The Elementals"" after it was recommended to me. What a great and scary book! It captured the characters of the Deep South very well, and the haunting was unusual. I highly recommend this book. Picking up more books by McDowell in the near future."
3,Cruciflicks' Review,"""I tell you, I have never watched anything, secular or religious, that could be so extremely outrageous and yet so intriguing at the same time."" -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder""I think it's nearly impossible to watch it and not have a strong reaction to the story being told. Not all viewers will have the same reaction, which is something the filmmakers took into consideration. I think they did a superb job of not only remaining unbiased, but also presenting the story from several different points of view."" -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-FounderFor the rest of our reviews on this and other faith based films, check out cruciflicks.net where ""We don't judge people, just the movies they make."""
2,Dissapointed,"This is one of my favorite kung fu films of all time, but the quality is horrible. My cell phone could've done a better job and mine is not that good. If you've seen it in theaters you'll be disgusted at the quality and if you've never seen it, you'll never get to appreciate the action and choreography at its best. A shame."
1,It doesn't work,"All those reviews here that say this cookie press doesn't work because it doesn't have enough power? They are true. To avoid hours of frustration and wasted effort, avoid this product!!"
1,Was ok when it worked.,"I purchased this cookie press because I thought I was buying a product with a good name behind it. However, with full batteries the unit seemed to labor to push the dough out, and then 3/4 of the way into the first batch of cookies, the unit stopped working all together. I tried replacing the batteries, but it still didn't work. Not sure if I should return it for another of the same unit, or try another brand?Too bad they don't still make the Wear Ever Super Shooter cookie press. I had that unit for years before it gave way due to over use."
1,Don't waste your time or money,I purchased the Wilton Cookie Master Plus Cookie Press last evening. I followed the directions for assembly and tried to pipe out dough (following directions in the manual) onto my cookie sheet. The plunger moved to the dough then stuck and would not move once it made contact with it. I ended up having to microwave my dough to mush in order to get the cookie press to press out anything. I had to keep pressing the forward button so frequently to try to get my dough to move and press out that the handle portion (engine portion) became hot to touch. My cookies turned out terribly and the recipe took me two to three times as long as it should have taken due to the complications with the press. I am taking it back for a refund today!
5,easy to use,I received item in short time but could not work it right. E-mailed seller and he answered very fast and directed me to the problem which was my putting in batteries wrong way. Switched batteries and it worked beautifully. Love it. Saves my arthritic wrist and hands. Will use seller again.
2,manual would be as good,"The dough still sticks and smashes down the cookies. I'm sure there is a technique, but I don't know it. Not impressed."
2,Nah,"If this score had the suspense music shown in the final battle bewteen Griffith and Keaton in the movie, I would have kept it since that is why I wanted it in the first place. Empty score without it, nothing great here, some moments but not enough for me."
5,The Symphony Rages On,I don't have Trilogy but I have all three albums individually. Thirteen and Lingua Mortis are five Star albums and Ghosts is close. This is a great buy for those who like Metallica sounding metal but want something more. All three albums are collaborations with the Lingua Mortis Orchestra of Prague.This is some heady stuff for anyone who likes symphonic metal ie. Therion etc.
5,Warm and cozy!,Another great Friday Sale bargain. I purchased these in several colors and gave them as Christmas gifts. You can't beat Isotoner for warmth and comfort. The snowflake pattern in green and white was not too childish.
1,Dreadful..,"a very anorexic volume that comprises a short three page (!)introduction on the history of one of the Jagdwaffe's best fighter aircraft, some walk-around pics of the Champlin Fighter museum's Dora, a few indifferent profiles and a series of model build projects making up the bulk of the 64 pages.... In the modelling chapters Bretscheider's 'red 1' (with spurious red engine cowling and cooling fan blades) and Walther Dahl's 'blue 13' ( here with green spinner!) are featured...the quality of the build ruined by totally erroneous camo & markings..not to mention the 'sit' problems sadly evident. It is obvious that the model builders have little appreciation for the Fw 190 as an aircraft..oh and the bibliography only features references to other Osprey works....I really do not know how Coughlin could have put his name to this as his Osprey Luftwaffe fighters book is not bad at all..Buy any other Fw 190 book EXCEPT this one if looking for a decent reference...I want my money back..!!!"
1,Don't waste your money on this one...,"We bought this vacuum 2 days ago, I set it up and tried it out. Result: the dust in the first room picked up ok with the dirt in the cup. In the second room I realized whenever I carried this vacuum (over the wire), I had big rolls of dust and hair under the wheels and nothing was sucked in any more. Also, after 1/2 hour of vacuuming over and over again trying different areas and floor surfaces, I had an immense amount of dust blown out by the vacuum covering shelves, nightstands and other furniture which had been cleaned before. I will return this product today and not settle with a cheap vacuum any more. Good luck finding the right one for you - this one won't be it!"
2,Not Surprised by the bad reviews,"I gave the Eureka Altima 12 amps vacuum 2 stars because it lasted me for 4 years. For the first 3 years it did well in my two bedroom condo. This was before I got a cat that sheds. Just recently the vacuum died on me, which is why I am on Amazon looking for another vacuum. If you have minimal use for a vaccum, then it's worth the small price you pay compared to the high priced vaccums. If you have pets, wool rugs, and vacuum at least once a week like myself, this is not the vacuum for you and will crack under the pressure (literally)."
1,Vacuum is a waste of money!!!,"I bought this vacuum approximately three weeks ago. It seemed like it had some good features, and the price wasn't too bad. Well the first time I vacuumed just after I took it out of the box, it did work well-sucking up a ton of dirt and fur etc. However, there seemed to be fine coating of dirt all over the outside of the machine. I was a little perturbed by that, but didn't think too much about it. Well the next time I went to vacuum, it sucked up something that it shouldn't have and then quit sucking. We took it apart and apparently the belt had broken. So we replaced the belt, and also cleaned out the filter which was totally clogged. I went to vacuum again, and it was only picking up about half the stuff on the floor. Plus I could now see that it was spewing dust into the air. So I returned it, and have since purchased a Hoover Elite Rewind which has many great features and works well."
1,TERRIBLE ENGINEERING!,"Previously owned the same model, worked great when brand new. Within a few months, the beater bar broke. Thought it was a freak accident, bought another Altima to have spare parts. Within weeks, the same cheap plastic bushing/bearing on the beater bar wore through, completely ruining the vacuum. As they say, fool me once..."
1,Absolutely WORTHLESS!!!,"I wish ""zero stars"" was an option. This was by far the worst vacuum I have ever used/purchased! The thing stays clogged, the filters require changing/replacement far too often, the belt constantly breaks and it has ZERO suction - it actually blows dirt around! I will never waste money on a piece of junk Eureka again. I should have listened to my gut when hubby suggested this vac at the wonderful, bargain basement price under $70. You really do get what you pay for!My advice - save your money and your sanity and DO NOT buy this vacuum."
1,Good-for-nothing,"It's not a vacuum cleaner - just plastic piece of junk. It has no suction power at all, you go over the pieces of trash/dust many times, and they are still there on the floor. Or you chase them around as the exhaust from the engine is right in front."
1,the worst vacuum,all dirt and fiber is stuck in the hose. it does not fill the 'Easy Empty Cup' and must be removed handful by handful. Shame on Good Housekeeping for giving the machine a seal of approval.
5,CET is excellent,I've been using this product on my dogs for a couple years now & it works great. Next I will try the CET treats and see how those work out!
2,HERB JEFFERIES IS FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN COWBOY STAR,"Crooner Herb Jeffries made it a first in a trio of ""B"" Westerns in the late 30's that featured an all-black cast. All in all, the films came across very well, with good direction and action and are worth viewing today. The other two titles are ""Harlem Rides the Range"" and ""Harlem on the Prairie."""
1,Waste of Money,"I was very excited to find this power carver. It looks just like the ones that cost over $300, so I gave it a try. The motor works great and for about 30 seconds I was very pleased. Unfortunetly, the handpiece gets very hot very quickly. After about a min it was too hot to touch. After 3 min it is too hot to use with gloves on. The motor and shaft are cool, it is just the handpiece that gets hot.This one problem makes the tool unusable."
5,There should be shows like this on TV today...,It's Full House. It was a great show during its original run. Now on DVD...It's honestly like reliving my childhood.
2,What Happened?!?!,"OK, I'm not that new to Kundalini. I really enjoy their Kundalin Yoga-For Beginners and Beyond. But this was done so poorly. The quality of the video production is horrible (1 star); there is even misspells in the closing credits - assistant, not asistant. The clothing is a poor choice; don't need to see that much nipple. The music was bad and narration was equally bad. The actual routines itself was marginal (a 3 star) but definitely not my favorite. What's with the ""grace is given, but is also to be earned,"" seriously?! What kind of spiritual teaching is that?! Grace is never earned, but freely given by God. I almost wish I hadn't bought it. Will I do it again; maybe. But this one will go on the bottom of my DVD stack."
5,you feel great afterwards!,"a good video, though it's a little older, you will feel really purified afterwards. in the video you can actually see ravi in the beginning and in the end. the acoustic in the newer videos is better, but this video is still one of the best (next to fat free yoga).i really can recommend it. it's really good for people who suffer from indigestion..."
3,Pro-Simpson but also an interesting perspective.,"Very overlong and shamefully pro-Simpson to the point of unbelievability. However, for those who want to learn everything about the Simpson trial, it presents an interesting perspective."
4,Another nice album from Elektrolux,another nice album from Elektrolux. I cannot stop paying for elektrolux albums. The artists are amazing. Here is another nice one.
3,Works well,"This is my first peel and cutter so I don't have much experience with other similar products, but this set does what it is supposed to do.The peel is very smooth and beveled at the end to pick the pizza out of the oven. I have had no problems getting a pizza on or off of the peel.The cutter fits well in my hands and makes it very easy to slice a pizza. The beveled edge on the cutter does separate the pieces when cut and does work as a handy way to put a slice on a plate. The only complaint I have is the cutter edge is already starting to fray and I worry about getting wood slivers in the pizza. I don't know if it is a manufacturing problem or a user handling problem but be aware that it can happen."
4,Great peel!,"Love the peel. Makes it easy to place and remove the dough from the oven. The wooden cutter doesn't work as well as I expected (from reading the other reviews). For the most part, I am very satisfied with the set!"
3,Talking about Gehry...,"What makes this book interesting is its format and organization, and the candid presentation of the projects by Gehry himself. What the book confirms, though, is that Gehry's work lacks any theoretical dimension, unlike that of his more serious equals, like Moneo or Siza. Gehry will be remembered one day for pushing the limits of architecture in the formal sense, for his wizardry and creativity. But eventually the repetition of the same forms in unequal contexts raises many questions. Does MIT's science center warrant the same formal expression as a museum in Bilbao? And will it really adapt to the changing demands of its client? Gehry lovers will definitely appreciate this book. Others who are looking for a more critical examination of his work will have to search elsewhere."
2,Not so good an experience,"One of the Brake Drums that I received was out of balance! This problem caused a transportation/time problem that forced me to perform some unethical actions at the local auto parts store. But in the end, Raybestos got the bad drum back!"
4,perfetto,Kaplan knows best how to describe issues within corporates and how to address them better. Alignment is very insightful for driving your company's departments and employees to strategy.
3,Worth Watching Once,"I was expecting a little more from this movie. The entire movie basically takes place in one cell and the storyline was a bit jumpy and it didn't build up enough that you could see a relationship building between the two which made you undertand. True, Michael Pitt is gorgeous enough to pass as a beautiful girl in the prisioners mind but it made me feel the two were stuck together and not together because they wanted each other.It would have helped the movie if you saw some sexual interaction between the two, but that was missing also and if there was, they cut away.Michael Pitt has done a number of gay-related movies, lets just hope the next is better!"
2,I hated this,"This movie is as painful to watch, as it would be to actually spend years in jail. Really makes you feel like you are there. Was hoping for a nice shot of the boy at least but there's no nudity worth seeing."
1,don't buy it,"I already own quite a few Star Wars action figures, and wanted to add this Darth Vader to my collection. Unfortunately the best thing about it is the look of the plastic package.Once I unpacked it, it looked cheap and worst of all, it does not stand, nor does it come with any kind of support base or platform.So you can't display it and it is way overpriced."
4,good pouch,My husband liked this pouch however it was a little to large for his comfort. He said it was a great product for someone who likes a bigger pouch on your side.
4,Eye Opener,"Having met Josh Kilmer-Purcell in his adopted town of Sharon Springs NY and toured the farm he and partner Brent now operate, I was relieved to know Josh survived his young adulthood. This book is a very personal look into the world of drag queens, an eye opener for me. Josh is a gifted writer, and I would suggest reading not only this book, but his Bucolic Plague, the story of how Josh and Brent became farmers - delightful."
2,I'm NOT an alcoholic because HE's a crack addict! [and such like],"Unfortunately, my reaction to this book is very harsh. Throughout the reading of it I kept thinking that someone must have told the author to write down all his adventures because they are so interesting. In fact the story could be fun if it were told with a sense of irony, or a sense of humor, or a sense of recognition but the author's voice is lacking any sense of direction. Hang on, here-it-is-the-point: we are to take seriously the invisible bond that is the relationship between the drunk drag queen and the crack-addicted prostitute. I felt neither laughter nor tears in this flat recitative."
1,"Poor writing ability, linear narrative, uninteresting story ... a waste of time","Told in an elementary-school narrative style, this book is trite and insipid. I'll save you the time reading it ... a drag queen who's an alcoholic meets and moves in with a drug-addicted male hooker, then they break up ... the end. There's no dramatic tension, no redemption, no pathos, no nothing. It's a book with neither a plot, nor a point of view. If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have."
1,Unfortunately NOT worth the read nor the money,"Anxious to read yet another memoir by a (...) New Yorker (though I don't know why), Mr. Purcell's account of his work as a drag queen falls bland within the first few pages.While his effort deserves merit, the author's attempt to bring the reader on what he sees as the dramatic ups-and-lows of a less than extraordinary life, immediately crashes to Earth like a lead balloon; Dreadfully boring at it's worst, fantastically made-up at best, the book hides no facts of it being the work of a first-time author. For readers' sake, let's hope it's the first and only time, or that Mr. Purcell fine-tunes his writing talent while living within the publishing capital of the world.If you can't muster creative talent there, perhaps penning memoirs and other written things isn't your calling."
1,A Sad Attempt at Both Camp and Story Telling,"Purchase of this book would be a gross waste of money and not worth the time to bag it and take it home. DON'T BUY IT!The author appears to take scenarios from accomplished, educated authors such as Augusten Burroughs and David Sadaris, and weave them into his own, some how.It isn't very funny and the stories are all over the place as if the author is jabbing for anything that may actually have the reader glad they've wasted $12 on the bunk he's printed.If you're considerthing this, don't make my mistake. Consider something from Sadaris. War and Peace has most humorous and interesting moments this this drivel."
4,Great read,This was a very entertaining book. I really enjoyed the writing style and the author really painted a vivid picture of all of his interesting experiences. I felt as though I was there with him. Definitely recommend this book!
3,not myself,"While the book is well written, quite humorous in places, I wish I had never read it. I liked Josh before reading the book. Now I see him in a whole new light. I feel very sad for his mother, I hope she has not read the book."
2,"It doesn't suck, but...","This book has some very funny moments (the drag queen shooting candy out of her butt had me rolling) but the brunt of the book was a disappointment. The author seems to string a bunch of exaggerated one liners together to impress rather than truths to inspire. It's just too superficial and pretentious. The book has no real heart. It was entertaining at times, but on the whole it's nothing special or memorable."
2,soso,"Received it very fast so it was good service. The Condition was ok, a bit dirty but it was used.The book itself is a lousy read so my advice is find something better to read."
1,Very judgmental without basis in facts. Some good ideas.,"Mr. Bracken makes loosely-worded assertions (too many to mention here) and does not back them up with facts. I was disappointed by a lack of a scholarly, studied approach. He is quite judgmental and sometimes outright wrong. He has a shallow understanding of the countries that he mentions in his book. The book is repetitious and belabors certain points over and over again.To be fair to Mr. Bracken, he does make some good points. However, what the book lacks is a substantiation based on facts. Most of the substantiation is on basis of judgments (which is a weakness of the book)."
1,Absolute feminist nonesense,"This is the single worst text book I have ever read, IF you can even call it that. It is more accurately a poorly written persuasive essay littered with inaccurate references and faulty arguments. It is absolutely appalling! Everything is geared towards being against men, he draws conclusions with unrelated premises. A great example is a study he showed that observed men being more skilled at high level math. His conclusion of the study was that clearly women have better verbal skills, though the study showed nothing of it. I truly enjoyed the womens studies class, loved the professor and took a LOT out of the class, but to this day, I cannot tolerate this book. It is littered with weak arguments and conclusions often drawn from next to nothing."
1,ear thermometer does not deliver,"Purchased the ear thermometer, then spoke with my doctor. Doctor said that they are not accurate at all, especially for children under age 3 years. My children are 2 years and 4 months old. Description of product says that it is good for all ages. Additionally, I cannot get the thermometer to work ... not even for my ear!"
2,Not good quality,I am disappointed in this product. I guess it is possible that mine is defective but it gives very inconsistent readings. I have a two year old and a one year old and it gives the error more often than an actual reading.
1,Not worth it,"We got this for our baby as a baby shower gift. It registered accurately only twice. Since the second usage, it registers drastically different temperatures within seconds of each reading. Covers are also impossible to find. Plus, I was told that I would have to wait until baby was 6 months for an ear thermometer to work properly. She's 7 months and no change!This is a complete waste of money. Please don't bother. Your best guess is more accurate for your baby's temperature. We bought a basic digital for less than half price and use arm pit temperature now. Much closer to reality!"
2,Discontinued,"March 18, 2003I just called Safety 1st to obtain covers for this thermometer and this thermometer has been discontinued! Safety 1st doesn't even make the covers anymore. They told me to go to CVS and purchase the CVS brand covers #1604. This is very frustrating to me, especially since this thermometer cost [alot]when I purchased it.I wouldn't buy it since getting the covers is almost impossible. I haven't checked CVS, but I will do that and hopefully find the covers."
1,What a horrible product,This product is completely inaccurate! It is dangerous to rely on this product to tell you your infant/childs temperature. It should be recalled.
3,Get extra covers...if you can find them!,"We have been fairly happy with the performance of this thermometer, however we are now running out of covers. It sounds like (from the reviews I read here), that I may never find them! I called Safety First, and they no longer carry these covers, since they discontinued the thermometer almost two years ago, however they tell me you can find them at CVS stores ...(also available online or over the phone). I will be checking into this, before CVS discontinues it, as well!!!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!,"I bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born. It is AWFUL! It gives strange readings like 94.5 and 95.1, when in fact I know that she has a fever! I bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings. Don't buy this, its a waste of time and $$$$$$!"
1,Inaccurate and Inconsistant,This thermometer is not very accurate or consistant. Whenever my son was sick and we used this it would give a normal temperature reading and I knew that it couldn't be right. We would take our sons temperature 3 times in a row and never get the same reading twice. I even check my own temperature and it would come up with crazy readings like 95.1! We got rid of this one because fever-induced seizures run in my husbands family and we needed something more accurate. It has been my experience that nothing digital gives accurate readings and that the old-fashion oral and rectal thermometers work best.
1,The Worst!,"My husband and I decided to buy this product because of the cost. We really wanted another brand, but we figured it was too expensive. Now I know why this thing is affordable...it's the worst!!We constantly had error messages, the readings always seemed inaccurate, and the covers are so hard to find in the stores! Plus, you had to wait an ETERNITY for the reading! By the time we got a reading, the baby had squirmed so much that we doubted the reading was accurate at all.By the way, we ran out in the middle of the night to get a Braun Thermometer, and we are sooooo HAPPY with it! It takes a second to get the reading, the covers are sold everywhere, and it's not that much more expensive than this one (only about 10-15 dollars). Believe me, it is so worth it!!I am going to write the company, as one reviewer suggested. There are some definite flaws that need to be fixed."
3,Good,Good product. I like it. Good cd. Good tool. Good . Good . Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good !!
1,Not worth the money,We bought this item for my daughter's 5th birthday and were very disappointed with it. It came with minimal accessories including 4 small bottles of paint that were gone after one usage on the canvas. The replacement paint is around $20. Over all this product is way over-priced. We paid $79.99 at Target and will be returning it tomorrow.
5,Dogs Love This!,"Now. brushing is a treat for the dogs, I use this on my dachshund and Pit Bull, it was before very hard to get them to let me brush, now they stand in line and drool!"
2,Over and Over and Over,"As a Rangers fan, I expected at minimum an interesting read. But what I got is a poorly written piece of tripe. Talk about repetitive: In one instance the writer, Rick Carpiniello, quotes three players--back-to-back-to-back--who essentially say the same thing.This book sorely needs an editor. Long rambling quotes permeate, while there isn't nearly enough analysis. The writer also has a penchant for doing things like saying the Rangers poor play is not acceptable. He follows by quoting Theo Fluery who says ""No, it's not acceptable,"" and Mark Messier, who says ""Losing isn't something we can easily accept."" NO KIDDING.It's a difficult read and way too repetitive. Did I mention it repeats itself--over and over? I ended up skipping paragraphs at a time. I don't know how this guy made it out of J-School."
5,A Must-have for Renaissance Dance,"Nobilta Di Dame is one of the major sources for information on renaissance dance. It contains detailed ""rules"" for how to do the various 16th century dance steps, as well as choreographies with music. However, this book is a translation, not a reconstruction of these dances. You still have to do the work of figuring out how to dance them yourself. Nevertheless, if you have any interest in 16th century dance, this book is worth buying, even if you don't dance the specific choreographies contained in it. Sutton's overview of the dance types of the period and the chapters discussing the issues involved in translating the text and music would be of use to anyone who is interested in the process of reconstructing dances from primary sources.Dover Publications has done the historical dance community a great service by making the paperback edition of this work available."
1,Great Music - Terrible CD,"When I played this on my computer it installed software that corrupted my playback software. I love the music but am severly pissed that I can't play it on my computer. Don't The Chieftains and RCA have enough money that they have to screw up the systems of poor fools like me? Derek Bell is probably flipping in his grave. Hell, I may never spend another Euro in Matt Malloy's pub and Paddy Maloney should be ashamed to call himself an Irishman - an Orangeman seems more like it."
1,Dust collector,Musically this is probably an ok CD - I say probably because as others have said it is so hard to listen to this CD it is going to gather a lot of dust. A waste of money and one I shall not repeat. .
5,Lost Cities,"This is the best adult game for two people we have ever found. You can play quickly or as long as you choose. This is a great game to keep the mind sharp as well as great fun. It has a board for discards, but it is a card game."
3,"Lot of Information , but...","Although there is a wealth of information provided in this book, it's jumps all over the map in it's presentation, and never really takes a stand on the validity of near death experiences."
4,"Sheepishly, I enjoyed this film --","The prospect of a low-budget horror film involving an eight-foot-tall mutant sheep probably doesn't inspire patronage from mainstream movie fans, but it's surprisingly competent and features far too little of its title beastie. Director had the temerity to name it ""Godmonster,"" and his other titles (""Alabama's Ghost"" and ""Roseland"") are likewise wonders to behold. The DVD features two creepy educational shorts on rural fly and rat control and the hilarious black-and-white nudie ""Giel and the Geek!"""
2,"very ,very basic instructional dvd","Good, but extremely basic instructions. Rather short dvd. This is only for someone who is an absolute beginner with no prior experience. Anyone else would say ""where's the beef?"" Save your money and buy the book, it is much better than the dvd."
1,Boring DVD,I actually fell asleep during the instructions. The instructor is VERY boring. DO NOT buy this DVD.
5,great clippers,i was nervous -this is my first baby and those nails are SO tiny!!! a friend swore by these clippers and i have been using them since i brought my daughter home! they are great-would recommend to anyone!
1,"Nail Crimpers, not clippers.",I got these in a baby 1st aid kit. Don't know if mine was just a defect but i could'nt get it to trim my 1 month's nails at all. It would just crimp the nail and then I would have to tear it off. I thought maybe it was because his nails are soft so I tried it on my nails and it did the same. I just threw them away. I wouldn't reccomend them. Although they were very confortable in my hands and I felt total control over the clippers. But still no good at trimming the nail.
3,broke after a couple of use,"It was great while it lasted. Broke easily and can't be fixed. If you use it with great care, then it may last awhile."
5,elegance,"I bougth this perfume because it has nice review and i can say it wasn't a mistake while walking some ladies ask me ""what are u wearing its smell soo good"" to make it short JUST BUY IT."
3,Stop and Go,"Bought the Lovesome Dove Collection and loved the stories, but all had a problem with the discs freezing. Tried on 3 different DVD players, with the same results. Really frustrating."
5,Womderful again,This series is an all time winner your. You can watch again an again. Ok here ar six more words
5,Aweome,Cool movie this totally influenced my life. I'm like wearing a cowboy suit. It's awesome what you can find when your 55.
5,outstanding,"I never saw this series when it was on television but I heard a lot of friends talking about it. I'm so glad I purchased this set, it was well worth the investment. Great entertainment."
2,Lonesome Dove DVD,I was very disappointed as [[ASIN:B003Q7B6ZC Lonesome Dove Collection]it was a Poor quality DVD with many difficult spots and couldn't see the whole DVD. I usually am very satisfied with all the products I've purchased and this was such a surprise.
1,Disappointed,These drip pans did not fit contrary to that which I had read and been assured of via reviews. They may well be decent drip pans but if the description is inaccurate as to the models they will fit then it is a complete waste of time and money.
1,no good,These pans did not fit my ordinary electric range. They were just off enough to not quite be right. I guess you get what you pay for. Cost almost as much to ship them back as it cost to buy them. what a rip off.
2,Doesn't fit GE Spectra,This doesn't fit my GE Spectra stove.The pans rest in the hole well and the electric grill parts fit in but when I try to lower the grill it won't sit in the pan. The pan is too small for the electric coils parts to fit in.Very frustrating. It is a slight problem and I couldn't force it to fit.
3,Nice,I ordered the wrong sizes so had to return these upon receipt. They are nice just don't fit my stove.
5,"Excellent, But...","Didn't fit. I knew I was taking a chance when I ordered these because there are several sizes and shapes of these drip pans. You would think that for something so simple, the stove manufacturers would agree on what size to make the drip pans."
1,The Edge,This book is very rubbish for it is just a boy runnig from a city. P.S i have not just looked at the front cover.
5,A Rock Music Fan's Delight,"This DVD is sensational. Every performer on here is a rock legend. I own all the VHS tapes from these individual tours, and I'm very glad to own this ""best of"" release, which captures all tours between 1989 and 1997 on film, including the 1995 tour which was not released individually on VHS like the other three, and thus hasn't been seen on video until now. Highlights for me include a rocking ""Iko Iko"" by Dr. John, an excellent rendition of Joe Walsh's ""Rocky Mountain Way,"" and Jack Bruce singing ""Sunshine of Your Love."" Also the big man himself (Ringo) gives many splendid renditions of classic Beatles songs as well as some of his own hits.This DVD is a marvelous compilation in every way. I also highly recommend the companion 3-CD set, as it showcases even more fine work from these very talented performers. (Also the CDs include music from the 2000 All-Starr tour, which was completely left off this DVD.)"
2,a punk band???...uh...i think not,"well anyway to categorize this band as ""punk rock""..let's examine ...the music is pretty much the new-metal (nu-metal i don't care how they call it (...)) type of sound...it has a mix of I guess some punk elements in a song..for about 5 seconds..then it breaks off into a...well nu-metal style..can't say death metal either...this is far from death metal. ( some idiots even called Slipknot death metal =]])..however.lyrically...I think they have some very thoughtful and provoking lyrics..showing a strong disgust for american corporations , religion , and a nihilistic self examination..something that the bands that are defining themselves as punk have given up and started singing about how much they love their girlfriends...i don't care much for this album...i love the lyrics...the message is great...but the music...i dunno man..the music sucks...and is it punk rock?...nah these guys can actually play"
2,A litle boring,"Amen could be a great band if the sound not was so Punk rock.the voice of casey chaos is not good to sing punk.more metal in the sound of amen is the best choise to them be a good band and not so boring.If you like bands like korn,deftones and slipknot listen to a band call SIEGRID INGRID you gonna fall in love for this band.peace!!"
1,Product is a promotional CD not for resale,There is a label on the record that clearly states it is only for promotional purposes and not for resale.
1,Pin head sized LOL,"This is supposed to be for adult costuming but there is no way this is intended for anyone over the age of maybe 10 years, unless they work in a circus sideshow as Zippy the Pinhead. Either they goofed, or their manufacturer goofed, but we ended up getting a ""mask"" that could only be used as a beenie on an adult - no way is it large enough to pull down over my head and face. But it was cheap and hardly worth returning, so I am going to give it to my neices to play with :)"
3,Other coments were perfect,"The price was perfect. The size was a bit small and tight (though, you would want it tight, it doesn't stretch or have much give).The comfort was less than... well, the entire mask wants to slide up or back, so the part under the eyes kept sliding up into them, and there is a lot of preasure on the nose, so your nose gets squished to one side or another. This coming from a 5'4"" size 10 lady.Decent buy for the price."
2,I was expecting more,"I was wondering if we would ever hear Bob Seger again, and what he was up to. 'Face the promise' fell short of my expectations, ok there is still this good old sound and the hammering and chorus that Bob Seger is good at, but not in a very exciting way anymore. Basics are there, but there is something missing, and at the end it is not very inspiring."
2,Painful.......,"Bob should have remained retired. I love his stuff and was a fan long before the live album put him on the radio. But this CD hurts to listen to. His voice is clearly strained on many of the tracks and it lacks energy. The CD starts off at a great pace, and I thought this was going to be something special! Then it starts to slowly, painfully die off to some off pitch, strained country crooner type of ballads. The electricity from previous records has indeed shorted out. Very little power left in his voice. I am glad he made a comeback attempt, but it didn't work. I think there is maybe three keepers on this one for me. The rest I can't even listen to, even as low backround music. Play this, and then play ""live"", ""Stranger in Town"", etc and the difference is obvious."
4,It's nice to have him back,"This is a solid, if not inspiring, Bob Seger release.There is some fun stuff here--I esp. like the duet with Kid Rock. About 50% of a great album"
2,Bob Seger has lost his voice,"I love Bob Seger and still listen to his best hits album in my car, but this new album is hard to listen to. The songs are good and the style is still there but Seger has lost his voice and it saddens me to listen to him sing. I only wish that he had not witheld himself from his fans for so long."
5,Bob at his best !!!,"Simply an awesome CD from Mr. Seger. I don't think he has missed a beat. ""Wait for me"", ""Face the promise"", ""Simplicity"", and ""No matter who you are"" are my favorites. He can still rock with the best of them, and that is what this CD is --- straight rock and roll. I bought 4 copies just to give to friends. AWESOME!!!!!!!"
4,An admirable effort,"Not his best release ever, but a very admirable effort from this classic rocker who has been away too long."
4,Seger-Face the Promise,The CD arrived within the week and was in great same...we have enjoyed it many times.
1,No wattage listed,"This is a good device,but what is the wattage of the bulb? There are more than one models using different types of wattage for this UV sterilizer. For example, 15w,25w,etc."
3,Avoid Mary Tamm,I have been a WHO fan forever.Tom Baker is outstanding as usual.I recommend that you seek episodes without Mary Tamm as she is very pushy and obnoxiously masculine really degrades the show.Would have been 5 star though Tamm made it very trying.All other aspects are excellent.
2,Will NOT work on computers with a RAID array,"Symantec doesn't share this little tidbit of information until after you have downloaded and tried to install it. I purchased the Norton Internet Security 2007/Norton System Works Basic Upgrade bundle. During installation of the System Works, I recieved the message that the GoBack utility will NOT work on computers with RAID drives. The message included a link to Symantec's knowledge base that confirmed this. This is a feature I was interested in--I would not have bought the bundle if I had known this in advance."
4,Works fine,"Had no problems installing this software. I first deleted my NSW 2006, deleted Windows temporary internet files and then installed NSW 2007 Basic. Works fine."
4,Healing live in Detroit,"C'est du pur smallwood, on ne se fatigue jamais à l'écouter. A consommer sans modération"
5,California Hardcore,"This great DVD contains four classic California punk shows originally released on VHS (Flipside Video Vols. 1 and 6). Two early punk bands, the Weirdos (in 1986) and the Dickies (in 1985) are paired with two hardcore bands, Circle Jerks and Bad Religion (both in 1984). A multiple-camera setup is used for each show and the loud sound seems to be from the soundboard, preserving the chaotic shows in all their ragged glory. The bands blaze through their sets as the stage divers dance among them and sometimes grab the mikes. Get it, you punk!"
3,"Poor quality video, CLASSIC content","This is multi-angle, shot on video concert footage from the early 80's. The video is bootleg quality and the audio is muddy.It's still great stuff if you're a fan of classic punk. Just don't expect much quality-wise. It's worth it for the Circle Jerks 20+ song set alone. That, and the out of control crowds. Lotsa fun."
4,Bargain!,"Bargain price for repair manual. Only thing is you'll need to convert metric (newton meters)to US (ft. pounds)for torque setings. Easy enough to do, as most wrenches come with the conversion."
5,TOMMY MY FAVORITE,"This is a lovely parfume, long lasting and clean scent. I love it. I have worn it over 5 yrs and don't plan to change anytime soon..."
5,Melodic Metal At Its Best!!!,Anyone who is into Melodic Metal MUST pick this one up.... Highly recommended. Catchy chorus and very melodic at the same time heavy as hell!!! Powerful vocals and the entire band are simply awesome!!! Do not think twice!!
1,Worst Main Event Ever,"The only reason anybody wanted to watch UFC 46 in the first place was for the main event between Vitor Belfort and Randy Couture. Instead what you get is a fight that is stopped within moments due to a cut from a glove seem. Pathetic. You can tell that all these guys in the ufc have very little skill compared to the guys in Pride and sometimes are akin to fat barroom brawlers.Pride FC is the top organization in the world. Sadly, the UFC is far behind."
4,Great Organic Garden Primer,"I had been gardening for years, but with conventional fertilizers and methods. We decided to go organic last year and I picked this book up. The first 60 pages were really helpful to wrap my head around the whole organic method. The rest of the book has the listing of all the vegetables and herbs that can be grown in Texas and notes on each one. That does feel like a bit of re-run from other books, but it's a very easy read and I got some great tips. I have since moved to Michigan, but I still pulled it out the other day as I start to prep for my season up here."
1,"no, thanks","This book is very,very Christian. I was expecting something far less so. In fact, I want to get rid of it because it mentions God and Jesus and so forth at least every other page. This book is a stinker! (no-I am not an a godless heathen)!"
5,One fo the Best!,"Helping the Struggling Adolescent is one of the best resource books on my shelf. While I am sure not everyone will agree with Dr. Parrott's conclusions or methods, this is one of the best books on helping teens through some of the most difficult issues in life. If you are looking for a book that you can pull off your shelf in a crisis to help you get some footing with what to do next, this is the book for you!"
2,Belongs in Russia,"Alesandr Rou's fairy tales don't travel well. They are very Russian and hard to understand outside of the USSR. He made many films of this type but I have not enjoyed any of them. This one makes no sense. If you want a good Russian faity tale get THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA, also very Russian but quite different, great fun and understandable."
2,SLIGHTLY SMALLER,"These are slightly smaller than the #1 envelopes you will get from say, Uline.So, if you have a very tight fit, as I do - they won't work."
3,adhesive strip was a little low,"Although these are a great value, they do have flaws. The first batch I bought had the adhesive strip was a little low and that made the flap to seal them hang over too far so I had to add a piece of tape to secure it."
1,Horrible Glue on Decent Package,"This is my first review on Amazon as I felt I needed to warn other users about this product.I use padded mailers at home regularly and have used a variety of products.Pros:1) Bubble wrap inside mailer is great quality2) Outside of mailer is strongCons:1) Glue on mailers is HORRIBLE. 1 out of 10 of the mailers have glue that works. The others, the glue either sticks to cover when it is removed instead of to the mailer or rips off the glue and part of the mailer.2) Size is tighter than other mailers so larger books won't fit inside.Due to the poor quality of glue used in this product, I will not be ordering these mailers again."
3,ok,The customer service could have been a bit better (nicer). The shipment was late and the quality of the mailers has gone down and the price has gone up. But otherwise no problems.100 #2 8.5x12 KRAFT BUBBLE MAILERS PADDED ENVELOPES #2
5,Great product,What a super product. Saves lots of money and time. Packaged perfectly and in great condition. Will buy again. I had no problem with the adhesive.
3,Needs tape on top of seal,The adhesive was not very strong. It needs tape over it to seal completely. Probably won't purchase this item again.
4,smaller version of this,"I am very pleased with this screen. It arrived in only a few days, during the Christmas rush! The quality of the materials and constuction were more than I expected. My one complaint is the brackets to hold it in place require you to drill into the firebrick. The screen is sturdy enough to stand and perform on it's owm though."
4,This music explains the story without words.,"The soundtrack of this movie goes along with it so well. It explains the movie to a tee. It expalins with out words how the life is for the characters of the movie. If you like the movie, you'll like the soundtrack."
3,How To Use Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional,"This is an interesting book on Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional that certainly covered the basics of using this software program. This would be an excellent guide for a first time computer user or for someone who was not real computer savvy.This guide has step-by-step full color pictures that will help you to understand what the book is explaining. I feel the photos are a real plus to the book.There is also a section on ?how-to tips? that offer some pretty interesting advice, such as how to lock your workstation or how to make a folder unavailable.Windows 2000 Professional is a software program all of its own, quite unlike Windows ME or 98. There is much to learn in order to successfully operate this system. This book does a good job of covering many of those aspects.This is a reference book that I would suggest you have on your shelf if you are running Windows 2000 Professional Edition, especially if you are new to computers."
2,Poor&Frustrated,"I was looking for products Ms. Ash recommends and I was disappointed. She gave some ideas on what to look for in products, but it requires me to spend alot of time looking. She even says it's a difficult process (unless you go to a professional spa). I looked at her website and as I suspected you'll have to spend alot of money (at least $30/product). I bought this book to try and find a way to spend less money-- but I found out I have to spend at least $120 for cleanser, toner, moisturizer and a mask-- this doesn't include the other stuff she recommends! Ugghh... Please someone recommend another book!"
2,What????,"Well I agree that it is colorful and whimsical and all of the above but I was shocked when I saw that this book is actually 4.5"" x 6"". I never seen a Dr. Suess book this size and was shocked not to mention disappointed to see what I got for my money. Too bad Amazon! You should have put the size in the description and If you did, it needs to be more prominent because I have looked once again and do not see the size mentioned. It will make a good story and a good laugh at the baby shower."
3,"Okay for babies in utero, but less so for older kids.","Our kids love Dr. Seuss in general, but this book hasn't been popular. Part of the problem is that many of the concepts are abstract and advanced, and thus difficult for kids ages 2-6 to grasp even with explanations. This is okay if you are reading the book to babies ""in utero"", as the cover suggests you do, but not for those who've learned to talk. The other problem is that the language, pace, and imagery are not up to the standards established in the earlier Seuss books. It's as if, near the end of Theodore Geisel's life, others were ghost-writing and attempting to imitate his style.My advice: Stick with Sneetches, Horton, Bartholomew, the Cat in the Hat, Yertle and all the rest, and leave this on the shelf after your kid starts to talk."
3,Disappointed,"While the story is itself is what I had hoped for, the size of the book was shocking. It is extremely small!"
5,Wonderful!,"What a fantastic idea! I really felt a connection while reading this to my baby girl who is due this September. The book is wonderfully written. As you read to your baby growing inside you, you feel like you're really helping to shape her attitude coming into the world! I can't say enough. Be sure to buyOh, the Places You'll Go! (Classic Seuss)along with it for when the baby is here and for later when they start reading."
5,"Oh, Baby, the Places You'll Go!","If you are interested in starting a library for your new baby of Dr. Seuss books, this book is important to have. It is a nice introduction for baby for the Dr.Seuss books to come. I myself am soon to be a new mom and have started a Dr. Seuss library and I am so glad I came across this book at the book store."
5,LOVED it!,"Bought this book for my sister almost 5 years ago when she was pregnant with my nephew. I even read it to her tummy at the baby shower!! So sweet, love the rhythm of the writing. Then when I became pregnant with my daughter I had to have this book! I read it everyday to my daughter in utero, and now (she's 6 months old) we explore many of the other Dr. Seuss books. :)"
4,I am one of the lucky ones.,"That's right. I saw this movie when I was 6 years old, in 1976 during a snowy night, at the Leo Mall in Philadelphia, and in 3-D! I haven't seen this movie in 31 years until tonight. I wish it was in 3-D still. Then again, I also wish I was skinny with more hair. Things change. But I still love this movie. And now I can appreciate how utterly bad it is. If this movie were a real ape, it would throw its own poop at itself, and love doing it. I couldn't praise this movie more."
1,What is this?,"As a conisseur of fireplace video programs, I would have to say that this is by far the worst. Or should I say ""blurst."" This DVD's technical shortcomings amount to visual misspelling, and I'm afraid I can't recommend it to anyone."
1,Um... My TVs on Fire,"Well what can one say? Not much really..Here is an hour of DVD that shows a fire burning to give you the feel of having an open fire, Heat not included (Unless there is something wrong with your TV)I would not bother to be quite honest, but if someone out there does not know how to use matches, then this could be just the ticket."
3,"Not a fireplace, Just a fire....","The view of the fireplace is not seen at all. The fire is more of a closeup of different angles / times. The picture quaility is good though. This DVD is not in widescreen. It is 1.33:1 (standard). The soundtrack / music is all classical music, which is ok with me, except the modern tunes. Please, ""Jolly old St. Nicholas and Up on the housetop"" is not what I would consider pieces to play in the classical style.The music is in either Dolby surround or DTS, and your sound options are: 1. Fireplace only, 2. Music only (in either surround)or 3. Music and fire (in either surround). The music is too pronounced in the foreground, if you were to turn the sound down because the music is ""waking the kids up on x-mas eve"", you wont hear the fire crackling.I would have perfered a fireplace from edge to edge, STATIONARY video and better mixed levels between audio and fire sounds."
1,were was the wide angle,short and sweet where is the fire? You sure don't see it in this DVD. At no time do you see the flam top to bottom. I wanted the DVD so my large living room TV could simulate a fire place but this simulation would have to include burnt eye brows.
5,"""You'll Believe A Man Can Fly!""","And we did! Superman was one of my favorite movies of alltime! It's action packed, exciting, romantic, and fun! Warner Bros. can try, but they can never replace Christopher Reeve as Superman! Not now or ever!"
4,Book Seems Rather Hard,"I took the AP US history exam last year and received 5. Now for the fall I plan on taking the SAT II, so I bought the book and took the diagnostic test and got more than half wrong, the questions seemed impertinent to american history and ambiguous. But the book does cover the topic in depth and the summary is helpful. Don't feel dejected when doing poorly on the tests."
4,Now on the big screen....in colour !,"No complaints here.Good quality widescreen transfer of the movie and some interesting additions such as the original trailer, a slightly inaccurate history of Dr Who's various TV incarnations, a Peter Cushing bio and commentary by Roberta Toovey and Jennie Linden.If you like Dr Who this DVD will be a good addition to your existing TV series collection. If you have never seen or heard of Dr Who (where HAVE you been !) you can still enjoy this colorful family adventure film which can be viewed with no knowledge of the TV series that inspired it."
4,DR. Who and The Daleks,While still markedly different from the BRITISH SERIES Peter Cushing's performance as (the human) DOCTOR WHO is still fun.
2,For young kids only,"To be fair, I only made it about 20 minutes into this movie - it's all I could take. Horrifically bad acting, simplistic characters, ridiculous slapstick, painfully obvious dialogue. The original TV show did it a hundred times better on 1/10th the budget.If you're not a Doctor Who fan you'll be bored. If you are a Doctor Who fan you'll be annoyed, offended, and bored. I'm sure this probably brings back good memories for people who saw it as young children, and maybe it has some camp value, but otherwise do yourself a favor and just watch the old TV show again.And not to beat a dead horse, but WOW is the acting bad. I've seen puppet theater with more nuance and subtlety."
3,Larry Buchanan rules!,"I love all of his made for TV/AIP movies. Curse of the Swamp Creature is 2nd only to Zontar the Thing from Venus. Francine York is one of the best looking women ever on film. You might have seen her in the Catwoman costume on an episode of ""Lost in Space"". John Agar lands his plane in the middle of the street (!). And goes to a local bar. He hooks-up with some....won't give away ""the plot"". This version isn't as dark as some other cheap dvd's. Let's hope RetroMedia issues this in better form like they did with Zontar/Eye Creatures. Still,if you find this in a dollar store like I did,Pick it up."
5,m77 rings,"They work fine.I had no trouble mounting my scope (3x9x44).Can hardly wait to take it to the range,then hunting.At first I was a little concerned about the way the rings mount to the receiver as its a little different than Ruger rings.I bore sighted my rifle during the mounting process getting same picture through scope and bore.With my scope in the neutral position for windage(center position) it seamed to be dead on.Really good set of rings(IMO)"
4,A pragmatic yet hopeful book on community currency innovations,This book allowed me to understand the system of money and money supply. I will be attempting to convince our small midwestern county to adopt a community supporting complimentary currency as a result of reading it.
5,"Local Currencies build Trust, & power to the people with more acountability","If you want to leave a legacy that counts then get on board . This is the issue . Now we need it even more with corporate currencies coming our way as the author stated years ago . Bernard Lietaer is well known is in Europe, & the currency markets . Bernard lays out a view that most people are not aware of . Bernard also gives solutions . Only about 20% make have been able to make it do able so far . Please do research ? I believe we now have even a better chance of making a local currency happen very soon . Do to over spending of the top 20 nations holding electronic currencies ?Are you aware that N. Dakota had 26?% return on their state bank ? Good for the taxpayers right . How very few politicians don't bring the issue up ? Maybe we should mention it at every town hall meeting ?"
1,green lantern animated series,be careful when buying this dvd i purchased it 4 times at my local walmart had to return it because disc 2 was in it twice. anybody else have trouble.
1,Not my favorite album,This is not my favorite album. I love country music and prefer Kenny's other albums that bring out his TN. roots.
3,Not Typical Kenny,"I am a tried and true country boy and will always love country the most. If you fell in love with Kenny from back in the day then this album will not be what you expect. It is very ""Island"" like and not his good ole crazy country music like Young, Back Where I Come From, Just Dont Happen Twice etc. If you are expecting that kind of music I suggest skipping this album. Not one song on this album is fast paced and crazy. If your looking for something that makes ya wanna put the pedal to the floor when drivin dont buy this. Good cd though with lots of songs that will calm you. Kenny please come back with the craziness we all came to love."
2,If you are looking for classic country.. keep lookin',"I've really enjoyed Kenny's past albums, I still listen to them all of the time. However, this album shows that he is moving away from the classic country sound that I loved so much. In past albums I've been able to relate to the songs and they've made me feel good about certain aspects of my life, pointing out that it's the little things in life that make life great. This one does the opposite. All this talk about the island getaway/lifestyle.... Are all of his fan's lives so terrible that we should strive to ""get away"" and go live in the islands? I prefer feeling good about my life.It gets 2 stars for being risky on some of the songs. But overall I'm quite disappointed."
1,What A Disappointment!,"This guy trys SO HARD to be Jimmy Buffet or like a Sammy Hagar for rock. This cd is average at best. All the songs blend together without any stand out single. Kenny needs to stick with having people write his songs for him. I find it amusing the image he trys to portray as a humble beach bum. I met him and he is only interested in talking to you if you are a young attractive female. The guy is not humble and very into selling you an image and lifestyle that makes him lots of money. No shoes remains his best cd with the greatest hits. Grow up Kenny and leave the high school girls alone, it might get you in trouble some day like R. Kelly."
5,Another Chacko Winner,"Chacko is a superb writer and story teller. His characters are real, and his plots exciting. This is one of his best, which is saying alot!"
2,Not for beginners,I tried this product because I want to shape my body. I was very disappointed when I started the DVD because it's very fast paced and there are no instructions on the steps before it starts there is a ten minute tutorial with basic use of the wave but not the moves. Not impressed. Wish I could get my money back.
4,A GREAT way to get into working out,"Like others have said, this isn't a workout for a hard-core fitness enthusiast. BUT, this is a TERRIFIC workout for someone who needs to get back into (or just INTO) working out. The workout is tough enough to be challenging, yet not too tough to make the average person want to walk away from. I'm not a ""gym"" person, truthfully, I *hate* working out. So for me to recommend ""The Wave"" (or any fitness anything) is remarkable. It's a great way to make really great strides in your fitness. It's fun, it's engaging, the hosts aren't obnoxiously enthusiastic! The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is that my stepper squeaks something fierce when I step on it! It's not terribly bothersome, but I wish it wasn't quite so squeaky."
1,THE WAVE NOT FOR POOR BALANCE OR PEOPLE WITH BACK PROBLEMS,"I brought this and its really hard to stay on it, Its real slippery, you have to make sure you have rubber on the bottom of your shoes. If you have back problems or balance problems this is not for you. Infact its scary. They should have made the top and bottom with more rubber on it. Its so slippery. I plan on taking mine back to the store. An accident is about ready to happen. i HAD TO TRY 3 DIFFERENT SHOES AND ITS STILL BAD. THEY NEED A NON SLIP ON THIS ON THE TOP AND ON THE WAVE PART WHEN ITS UPSIDE DOWN. I SEE THE POTENTIAL BUT I HAVE TIRED EVERYTHING TO STAY ON IT. ITS SO SLIPPERY EVEN WITH MY GOOD SHOES. I AM GOING TO HAVE HUSBAND PUT THE NON-SLIP PAINT ON STUFF ON THE WAVE PART SO I CAN STAY ON IT. YOU CAN HURT YOURSELF BE CAREFUL."
1,Not for the out-of-shape,This exercise product is not for someone that is totally out-of-shape. I just did not like it at all. The plastic that it is made from is hard on the body.
3,CRAPTACULAR DROID!,"This figure looks simply cool with the electro staff and removable cape but, here are the down sides: 1. it has NO ankle or knee articulation 2.his hands can't grip the electro staff 3. In the film they wore there capes while weilding the electro staff, but with the figure if you try to make him hold it in two hands, his cloak will usually look like it is defying gravity!So it's best to just use them as statues!"
1,Same old battle of good vs evil,"If you're familiar with the age old battle between good & evil, then you already know what's in this book. Personally I was overwhelming disappointed that there was nothing revealing in the book, just the same old religious Armageddon-is-coming-repent-now story with a new addition of alien (yes I said alien)characters and mystical names. Even the mystical names, The Shadows, aren't new. It was discussed back in the spring of 2001 on Art Bell. I give this book 2 thumbs down."
2,"not great, BUT . . .","I can't honestly say that this serial episode is very good. The aliens are just not at all well realized, and the conflict between them is just not interesting enough storywise to overcome that major fault. Also, the Zarbi sound effects are so annoying that I was tempted several times to stop watching.That said, the concept of the story is SO ambitious that -- given how little money was spent on ""Doctor Who"" during this era -- I can't help but give everyone associated some applause for even trying it. In my opinion, they failed, but failing every now and then isn't the worst thing in the world. And I also have to admit, William Hartnell is very good in this story, and some of the dialogue is excellent. All in all, I think it's a weak story, but very much worth seeing for fans of the franchise.And, of course, the bonus features are typically great. You've got to love the BBC."
2,An Ego Trip for Rick Steves,"I am giving this a low grade because Rick Steves appears in nearly every scene. I would much prefer to view England with a background voice-over instead of watching Rick Steves chatting people up and feeding his face.His book, however, is truly helpful and filled with wonderful advice."
2,The Last Express,"I definitely don't care for nonlinear games. I may go back and try to solve this one again some day, but for now, I prefer games with puzzles and progress. I did a lot of dying the few attempts I made at the Last Express."
5,This game is great,"I love playing this game, I love running up and down the train (or hanging off the side) in order to find things and people, sneaking into rooms, stealing certain items, and most of all ... the indian gentleman in my sleeping car. It's great because you can wind back the clock (although there are only preset times you can set it back), and do over whatever you did wrong. You can just walk around the train until the game ends, listening to everyone's conversations if you want, although you won't get far in the game. This game is great!!!"
2,Very poor packaging,"The liquid works as well as the more expensive brands, however, the packaging is very poor and cheap. The top was difficult to screw on properly once opening and this caused a lot of the liquid to evaporate and was a nuisance. In addition, the tray and brush inside are very difficult to reach/grab so you end up sticking you fingers inside the liquid for every cleaning. I am happy to pay more for the better packaged jewelry cleaners."
5,Jewelry Cleaner,I found this jewelry cleaner worked wonderful. Just dip it in and instantly my jewelry was shining.
1,Not very clean items & bad packaging = messy,"It sure doesn't seem like this stuff cleans very well. I left a necklace to soak, then brushed it and rinsed. When I got done I thought it didn't look clean so I used one of those jewelry cleaning rags - LOTS of tarnish came of the necklace - like I hadn't cleaned it at all.The brush needs to be wider - its skinny and difficult to use on items like necklaces. It worked fine for rings - and after much brushing, the rings were definitely cleaner than before soaking.My largest complaint is the packaging. I had to cut the plastic protector off the top (standard), but I can't get it off the actual outside of the jar - so it doesn't close properly and leaks everywhere. I have tried multiple times to remove the plastic, spilling the liquid all over the place. Very frustrating :("
3,10 British war movies,These movies do show their age but all-in-all were pretty good. Considering what is on TV they were an excellent alternative to flipping channels during all the commercials.
5,Animation at its best.,"Mushi-Shi is animation at its best. This series shows that not only can Japanese animation stand among the heavyweights here in America, but it can ever surpass them. The only real short-coming of this series is that there is no over-arching plot of any kind. But the vignettes are fun, the characters are great, and the series is one of the best ever mad."
5,Masterworks of Classical Photography,"My family likes this calendar so much -- we have been using it regularly since 2001. Congratulations to Amazon for making the purchase of this calendar so easy from any part of the world! Guido Milanese, PhD, Genoa, Italy"
5,Love the socks,"These socks are the only ones my husband will wear -- white for running, comfortable and wear well. Also the package arrived quickly."
5,Gift for my son,Best report they are fine. Could be larger as he has very large feet. Manufacturers do not seem to market to the larger foot.
5,Best socks,These are the best socks ever. I have flat feet andthese provide soft cushioning.I still have the original ones I bought 10 years agoand they still do not have holes.
1,wabi sabi for the illiterate and unpoetic,"Of all the wabi sabi books I've attempted to read, this one is the most poorly written. Same old regurgitated information, but written by someone who must have flunked out of their high school English composition class. Sorry, with so many better books out on the subject-at least three-why subject yourself to this gibberish?"
4,Odor Absorber Really Works,The Punati corp's Lavendar Odor Absorber really works. In less than five minutes it will eliminate odors in the bathroom. The only down side is that one jar only lasts 3-4 months.
1,Propaganda for the weak-minded,"'What is $cientology?' is a publication that seeks to draw upon the most vulnerable and gullible in our society into surrendering their minds (and pocketbooks) to what is quite possibly the most dangerous cult in the world yet seen since Jim Jones and 'The People's Temple Full Gospel Church'. Should you feel the need to join the Church of $cientology, sit down and discuss your decision with a friend, family member, or significant other, and listen to what they have to say."
1,Not an accurate description of Scientology,"Well, what would you expect from the charlatan who created the scam. Better, more accurate information, can be found by searching online for the St Petersburg Times (now called the Tampa Bay Times), in Florida."
1,Goofy Video,"I really hated this video. I thought it might have interesting animals or African landscapes or something, but it's just goofy. It's geared more towards people who would like Bratz dolls - intellectual parents will not like this video. I gave it away at a yard sale."
1,"If you want to teach your child to break dance, ...","then by all means, please buy this video. If you want to reinforce that handwashing is important, buy this video (there is a very random handwashing lesson inserted among the break dancing). If you love yoga, and want to share this love with your children, go somewhere else."
1,Dead on first impact! Hazard! Do not buy!,"This product has been a complete disappointment. My husband had the older Dead On for more than 7 years and it was great, unfortunately a friend lost it, so he decided to replace it with this product. He purchased two of these, one for him and one for his friend.The first day of use on the job, the tips of the claw on each side broke off into soft Doug Fir! Unbelievable! Well, he decided it must have been a fluke; fortunately he hadn't given the second to our friend yet, so he kept it for himself. Well, guess what? He only got one good day out of it before a tip broke off and embeded in his finger. Poor quality of steel and DANGEROUS!! And we just found out we are three days past the deadline for a full refund. Buyers beware! Worthless!"
1,Caution: This product may do more harm than good to your body,"I ordered the Braggs Liquid Amino Acids because I love their ACV. I was looking online for recipes to use the product in and came across the following blog. After reading this, I would caution others not to use this product, as it may be harmful. The blog seems to be reviews of honest people who have had very negative side effects from using Braggs Liquid Amino Acids. I am posting the blog source so others can read, and determine if this product may be causing them more harm than good.[...]"
4,I like it!,"Very tasty. Have been experimenting with it. Even basted pork chops on the grill with it. Put some in the bottom of the frypan while making an omelet and was very surprised on the good flavor it gave the eggs. If you try the omelet thing remember that if the frypan is very hot it will cause a lot of spitting and such when it hits the pan, so be careful. Finding lots of ways to use this, glad I tried it out. Not expensive either."
1,This album was NOT released by Ginuwine,Ginuwine appears on a few tracks but the album is the work of a shady Bay Area producer that has misused Ginuwines name to make money.
1,the boredom was endless and lasted a long time,"Nothing could have prepared me for the monstrosity I was about to read. This book starts out promisingly but quickly degenerates into the ramblings of a spoiled and inarticulate man. Tierney is repetitive and continuously strays from the topic of religion to that of his own experiences. These experiences are useless, unless the reader plans on scaling large mountains in Peru. Besides this I thought the book was generally awful. Explanations are given numerous times, the author is self-glorifying and useful information is always lacking."
5,Buffalo Engineer,"I became a self-taught electrical engineer partly due to this textbook. Later went to Univ of Buffalo, and took two of Dr. Wobschall's classes. Good guy; good book. Too bad both are semi-retired now."
5,Unwritten Rules of Social Relationships,Very fabulous insight into the world of ASD and being a grandmother to an Aspie I welcome all the info I can gather. Such an interesting world and Temple Grandin and Sean Barron are heros to share their life experience and expertise. Thanks so much for your wisdom!!
2,Not worth watching,"This is the worst adaptation of literature for TV that I have seen, and I have seen many. The acting is comical, when it is not wooden (Mr. Domby). It seems more like a high school play that was filmed by a parent than it does any kind of decent TV production. And it goes on for 10 episodes like that. The end is so simplistically trite that I felt cheated after putting in so much time watching the rest of the story."

I changed the power supply to make my machine run like a Gamer PC. its is worth it for the money i would say Go for it but for technical side i dont like the fact they ship with cheap power supply. LOL Enjoy
4,Wonderful!,"UPDATE 11/24/12Although I have retired these for the season, I'm still quite happy with this purchase. They're comfy, subtle, and look a lot more pulled together than run-of-the-mill flippie floppies. Really impressed they still look good after all this time. If Amazon hadn't dated my purchase I never would have imagined I ordered these 5 years ago. Strong work, Rainbow!ORIGINAL REVIEW ca. 2007These sandals are comfortable, durable, and versatile. Although I have a closet full of shoes, I wear these more than any other pair (probably more than the others combined!). I have Rainbows in other colors and variations, but find the hemp easiest to wear and the thin strap more feminine than its wider cousin."
5,Beautiful decadence.,"This is a great issue by Decca's Entartete Musik series. Unlike the grim timeliness and edgy expression characterizing otherreleases of this anthology, Kálmán's ""The Duchess of Chicago"", is an awesome Operetta that oozes froth and fluff. Cockamamie plot notwithstanding, Kálmán's facile tune-spinning and modest knack for musical parody (Beethoven's Fifth meets Black Bottom) save theday. The excellent cast sails through the polyglot dialogue, brandishing a variety of convincing accents, and Richard Bonynge transforms his crackerjack Berlin Radio Orchestra into a cafe band from hell. Fun, if ultimately inconsequential stuff."
5,Serious page-turner,"Just when you think you've figured out who ""dunnit"" - think again. At first I thought, ""oh, this isn't that good of a story, I know who did it."" I was absolutely wrong.I bought this book because of my respect for Rabbi Tulushkin's work with Judaism and for Mr. Estrin's production of Dennis Prager's radio talk show. I was not disappointed. For skeptics, synics, and those with a lot of questions and curiosity, I highly recommend reading this book. You will not be able to put it down.I'm looking for a sequel."
2,Celtic? More like Irish rock for the most part.,"This album would be better titled ""singers from Ireland and Scotland"" rather than Celtic music. You're not going to get too much Altan or Capercaillie type Celtic cadences here-a lot of rock groups that originated in Ireland, and a lot of fiddle instrumentals, many of them quite melancholic. An expensive pick for just a few worthwhile tunes. Stick to the Putumayo collections-they are much more upbeat and authentic."
4,John Lee Hooker at his prime!,"Who needs color and hi-def when your talking about the music of legendary John Lee Hooker! Yes, the camera work is only fair and whoever was controlling the switching of the cameras was evidently new(!) at the job, but it's great to watch John Lee performing several of his well-known masterpieces for a appreciative crowd. The sound is better than I expected, thanks to the performance being recorded on videotape. For an almost 40-year-old performance, not bad!"
2,"A book for a beginner, not a professional",I am a massage therapist who frequently incorporates aromatherapy into my practice. I was looking for a book to broaden my work with my prenatal clients. I found this to be more a book for someone who knows nothing about aromatherapy and isn't a professional. Lavender and orange...knew that before buying this.
5,Snowman Rug,"Matached the shower curtain and has stayed clean with just vacuming. Colors are great. So far, no problems with this product."
4,The standard,"I have used FrameMaker since it first came out. So did the tech writers in my group. I'm now retired, and use FM to produce and mail out up to 5,000 volunteer organization docs and newsletters and so forth per year. We are likely to remain on our present desktop system for some time to come, and I wanted to install FM on our new laptop. Well, we retired and moved to a new house, and God only knows where those installation kits are. Yes, it's important enough to me to buy a whole new FM V7 so my productivity will not be impacted by worrying about learning a newer version. And it's a testament to the stability of the product that I believe it will be viable for years to come. I simply don't need any unknown feature upgrades that might be glowing in a newer version. It works for me, and that's that.Why did I chop one star off the rating? I've never been impressed by the FM documentation itself. It is more of a ""You can do this"" rah-rah rather than a powerful how-to guide."
4,Soul Explosion,"This double CD set is great! In addition to providing a wealth of songs in a single collection, included is the only CD available with ""Funky Chicken"" by Willie Henderson. ""Funky Chicken"" is a legendary soul song."
5,The best ELEKTRA so far!!!,"Great, amazing production.Kupfer rules with this intense and inspired stage directing.This is the first Elektra of Eva Marton and it is the best interprentation I have ever seen so far.Her Elektra is passionate, human, full of pain, insanity, fear and fury. Multimensional portrayal and great conducting from Abbado, as well.A MUST for every opera fan!!! A MUST SEE!!!"
2,Another Kupfer Disaster,"Harry Kupfer has a long history in destroying opera productions. This performance of ""Elektra"" is no exception. I find it amazing that after all the operas he has ruined, he still has no understanding of the operas he directs - or opera in general. If you love opera, avoid Kupfer. The music, the performers, the story of ""Elektra"" are all so powerful, it's hard to think that simply bad direction could ruin this particular opera, but it does. And if you don't believe me, before you buy this version, see any other non-Kupfer production first! The sets and lighting (not to mention the singers and the orchestra, which were covered in other reviews) here aren't particularly bad. But, the costumes are awful. In what period in history did people dress like this? And what psychological motivation would cause each of the cast members to go swinging on ropes?"
3,good book but less than i expected,"I bought this book for my 3yo daughter. She likes a few stories from the book, but mostly not so much. The stries are mostly quite long and there are not as many pictures as i was hoping there'd be. Overall, far from our favorite."
5,"19"" Hanns-G Widescreen LCD Monitor",Excellent! Easy install. Fast refresh. Unbeatable price for the quality. Beautiful picture even in direct sunlight! Buy it on Amazon.com from TigerDirect.com. You won't be sorry.
4,good game if you like these kind,"i bought this game for my wii when i first got it, and i remember playing it and liking it until i got to a certain part that make no sense. so i thought that for the ds it would be a little different. as i was playing it, things didnt react the way the were supposed to and therefore i would fail missions or get a crappy score. then i had the same issue as i did with the wii version, i got to a part that they dont give you any instructions on and you cant get past it because you have no idea what your supposed to do. so this game is good and bad!"
5,Final book - great ending and new beginning.,"I thought this was a great series and am happy that they have concluded this story thread til now. I always fouynd myself wanting the books to continue, Morgan is a geat character."
4,Good battery,This is a good battery. I had a device in which the battery ran down. It was this type of battery. I replaced it with this battery and it worked fine again for a long time.
3,It was O.K.,"This book was about a girl named Karen, who supposedly gets mysterious phone calls. All of them were when she was on the phone with her boyfriend, who she thinks she is losing to another girl (hint, hint). Anyways it is alright. I read it about two years ago. So I'm not that much into R.L. Stine anymore. Christopher Pike is way better. I recomend this book somewhat"
4,The Day To Day To Die For,"Call Waiting by R.L. Stine; Scholastic: New York, 1994. ISBN: 0-590-4780-4Have you ever been betrayed by someone before? Well, Karen, the main character, gets betrayed by someone really close to her in Call Waiting. This is a mystery book written by R.L. Stine.The book Call Waiting is about a girl named Karen who is dating a guy named Ethan. She suspects that her boyfriend is cheating and lying to her. Also, they stopped hanging out. Then Karen starts getting creepy phone calls saying that they are going to kill her. Everyone thinks that she is making that up so she can get Ethan's attention. So is Karen lying or telling the truth that they are going to kill her?The theme in Call Waiting is that there is always going to be somebody who is going to betray you.I recommend Call Waiting to people who like mystery books. The reason why is because you don't know what's going to happen next. The author tries to confuse you.By: Angelica Londono"
2,Phone trouble,"Karen suspects that her boyfriend Ethan is losing interest in her, and that he would rather be with Wendy, the most popular girl in school. The suspicion is driving her nuts.Then the threatening phone calls begin. Are they jokes or is someone after her? Or is she losing it?I found this book disappointing. It didn't captivate me."
4,Good product,I bought this to replace the filter in my wife's Rav4. I have had one for years in my mustang and really like it. So far so good with this filter.
4,Great artistic film,"The music is great, as well as the scenery - good for both adults and as an educational video to show kids that play the cello"
3,Yoyo Ma is the best!,"I love the music, and so Yoyo Ma becomes the first musician to receive a paid purchase from me in years. However, the disk was one heck of a pain in the neck, due to copy protection that made it not work on my linux machines. To watch the videos, I had to hack them out of the the disk and cut them into pieces with the same software used by people who post this stuff on youtube. Makes me feel really smart for paying for the music instead of just downloading it free from youtube, a much easier proposition."
2,"An encyclopedia of Fencing, NOT of the sword!","Being fascinated with swords of all types (Mostly eastern), I eagerly snatched up this book. I was dissapointed to find that this is not so much an encyclopedia of swords, as it is an encyclopedia of fencing with a strong bias towards film and european styles and figures. If it wasn't $80 I might have kept it."
4,Wonderful story to prepare your child for entering school,"The Betsy series are a wonderful way to introduce a young daughter to the delights of starting school. While Betsy's adventures reflect life in the first half of our century, they ring true as high drama to a five-year-old. There's the search for a lost dog, plans for a birthday party, a lesson learned from violets snatched from the neighbor's yard, walking to school, meeting the new teacher etc...The books, four in all, include just enough drawings to keep a child peeking ahead to the next chapter. Each chapter is short enough to read at one sitting"
1,euro-bore,"I agree with Frankenberry from Hollywood Ca...however he was much too kind...THIS IS THE WORST mess I've purchased in a long time and I sold it for junk. This is not Franco at his best, it's Franco at his most boring! Not even worth keeping as a Franco curiosity. So the cinematography is nice and the print is good...nothing happens until that ridiculous ""torture scene""! That's not why I enjoy Euroshock. I want something that keeps me glued to the film and this waste of disc material wasn't it....I adore Image for their diligence in reviving these old chestnuts with such TLC, but they should have slipped the old Baron out the back door to the dumpster. Pee-eew. I'll wait for ""Mill of the Stone Women""---it ain't Franco, but at least it's Euroshock!"
4,$100 Star Wars E3 BF52 PALPATINE,"The reason, more than likely that this particular figure is so expensive is I do believe that it is a variant, the figure was packaged with the wrong color lightsaber-Jedi blue instead of Sith red, and then later corrected by Hasbro, I don't see why the vendor fails to mention this in their description. Figures with mistakes are generally more sought after and therefore more expensive as they are obviously limited in number"
2,the end of believable plots,"The British television industry has such an appetite for detective stories that the script writers are running out of quality, believable plots. This may not bother you if you view this series to enjoy the eccentric characters. Others will have to use their ""suspended disbelief"" mode of viewing to not get disappointed. Fans of the original Agatha Christie novels will be disappointed. One example of a ridiculous plot requires Japan, a highly industrial nation with the best fighter airplane in the Pacific for the first few years of the war to not be able to make low technology equipment for its army and have to import it from other countries without the government of those countries noticing.This set of programs comes from the time when British television viewers started complaining that the BBC programming was being dumbed down."
5,A Must have book for anyone!!!,"One in four of us will get cancer, that is scary!! What is more scary that we have put forth over 2 trillion dollars in cancer 'research' and yet they are treating cancer that exact same way they have since the 70's. Radiation, surgery and chemo are barbaric, expensive and unsuccessful! b17 WORKS and this book written in 1974 proves that!! You can find the vitamin by searching 'laetrile'. Another great must have book is 'Cancer step outside the box by Ty Bollinger. This book has many proven cancer cures. Also listen to the cd Dead doctors don't lie. Its very enlightening about the medical field and how most diseases start from a simple deficiency."
3,I consider this book it's o.k.,"I rating 3 starts because even the book it's good , hasn't the number code if you need to work with "" My laboratory writing"" you need to buy the access code online, so it's more expensive, but if you don't need to work online just with the book that is really good book."
1,A Pitiful Orgy of Irrelevance,"To butcher the words of Winston Churchill, Never have so many paid so much homage to such a non-deserving target. This book seeks to celebrate such an infantile idea as royalty by exposing the reader to pathetic emotionalism. It does, however,provide an insightful glimpse of the potential for the maleability of the human mind by the media and our disgusting obsession with minutiae."
5,Thank God for A Good Game,"I'm so glad Aspyr Media decided to make this game into a mac. I have never been able to play any games I enjoy because of my Mac system. But all of this has changed. This game has great grapihc's and sound which get's you into the game. So many great levels, but the Normandy mission is one to be hold. BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!"
1,what a dud,I had more fun assembling my kids toys with instructions in koren and no pictures than i did with this game. I can see where it can require 3 hands and is a fast paced game. But it is extremely difficult to command and stay alive. I can not understand how anyone can play it and have fun.
5,A surprise treat!,"Stories about the Old West, (cowboys, Indians, settlers, etc.) usually don't appeal to me, but I was surprised and delighted by Settler's Law. It grabbed my attention, and I could barely put it down. It was also a very reasonable price to pay for a great read. I look forward to her next one."
5,THE PRELUDE TO HIS SEVENTY-THREE RECORDING,"THIS IS, THE FAMOUS RECORDING STANLEY KUBRICK USED FOR 2001!! IT IS, A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE, ONLY OUTDONE, BY THE GREAT CONDUCTOR""S BERLIN PHILHARMONIC PERFORMANCE, OF SEVENTY-THREE!! IN STRAUSS, KARAJAN, HAS NO PEER!!HIGHLY RECCOMENDED"
3,If you want a 'just average' score,"This book was ok if u only want an average score. I just took the SAT II Biology E the other day and the questions on the test were BARELY covered in the book. The does have some detailed summaries, but only about 1/4 of the material on the test could be found in the book. and the practice tests were SOOO incredibly easy. Perhpas this was to boost morale so it made the book look like it was a good book......but I dunno. When I take the test again after i take AP bio, i'll use the Princton or the Kaplan."
3,Good for the practice tests....,"I was getting a B in my honors biology class, and I decided to take the SAT II Biology. My teacher gave us a practice test one day and I got a 510, and I almost decided not to cancel taking the test because of a fear of getting a 500 or lower on the test. I bought this book and the Kaplan book and I did not really like this book too much because the review was horrible. It was good for the practice tests though. With the aid of the Kaplan book, I managed to get a 650 on the test (which is a long way from 510), so I suggest getting the Kaplan book for the Biology SAT II."
3,Possibly too simple,"As Shilov write in the introduction ""I have tried to accomodate the interests of larger population of those concerned with mathematics"" and at that he seems to do. However, the book does require some mathematical background as he appears to omit defining a few things. I believe the book would be ideal for those who want a handy reference, or an easier book when struggling with an analysis course.However, for the more mathematically inclined readers, the problems are often too easy, and many things are proved that could be better left as exercises. For a more difficult Analysis book, I would reccomend Rudin."
1,Don't bother with this movie,"If I could give this movie a half star, I would have. The acting was really bad, there wasn't much in the way of a plot, and the special effect weren't even that good, either. Talk about pretty cheesy! Don't waste your time with it."
4,Gritty Good,"Very good movie. Decent acting on all parts. I think it was a little chopped up with all the commentary breaking the flow of the movie. They should have spent more time on the story line like Big Al's associations and how Kat got where she was. That is why I gave it 4 stars..45 is pretty true to life what goes on between a battered woman and abusive man. Very well played. The friends all want to do something but like in life, most talk big but can put the rubber to the road. And like most people in this world, nothing gets done unless there is something in it for them. So bottom line is, this is a well acted movie about what real life can be for the unfortunate in these situations. The movie is gritty and coarse but then isn't life sometimes. Well worth watching."
1,Dumb movie .... a waste of time,"Thin plot and Grade B acting. Nothing worth adding to a worth nothing movie. You'll want to eject the DVD after 22 minutes. Oh, don't forget to set your automatic counter for the word fu**ing. Milla still can't act."
1,No Substance!,The tiny book is notjing more than some pictures of some average pools. Then the rest of the book it a translation into other languages!Save your money!
3,A book that tries to be simple and at the same time rigorous,"A book that tries to be simple and at the same time rigorous. In my opinion, not succeeding to well in any of these attempts."
3,Needs A Jumpstart at the First,"The Great Houdini, by Monica Kulling is about a little kid who goes to a dime circus. His family is very poor and barely has enough money to get him a ticket. While he's there he goes to watch a magician, and he is amazed. After the show the magician shows him how he did it. He decides he wants to be a master of illusion. He starts practicing what the magician shows him, he decides he will leave home and become a performer. He goes all around the world, he has bad times and he has good times. This book was boring at first but got better in the end, it's worth the boring reading. I give this book 3 out of 5 stars."
3,A life of tumult,"I was a 5 year old boy when my father was assigned to Iwo (earlier Guam) with the Third Marine Division as a Battalion Surgeon and have read many if not most of the books on Iwo and the Pacific War. This an engrossing book with a lot of drama, but most of it relates to Mr. Lucas' life as a civilian after the war. He was unquestionably a very brave, determined, driven and intelligent man. Some of his ""exploits"" en route to Iwo and after the war are almost unbelievable (I believe them)--the courts martial, disobeying orders, constantly fighting (the mention of him punching someone at the VA who ""irritated"" him tops the list) etc. What does it say about somebody whose therapist commits suicide and his wife tries to hire a hit man to have him killed? Man oh man. But you have to admire and have compassion for this man who obviously had some significant anger management and personality problems. He obviously did a lot of good and deserved to seen as a hero."
4,Great Info!,"I moved to San Francisco in 2002. I found this book browsing at the Borders at Union Square on the first weekend I was there, and it was the best introduction I could have had to the city. This book helped to make my year in the San Francisco very memorable and magical. I didn't have many girlfriends in the city when I moved there, and this book filled in the information void very nicely. I found good hair stylists, spa services, activities, restaurants and shops which would have taken a lot longer to find on my own. San Francisco became very comfortable very quickly. The format of listing by neighborhood (with no index) made entries in this book a little hard to keep track of, but I always found what I needed with a little extra time. And, if I knew I would be in a certain neighborhood one day, I would look up shops or restaurants in that area so I would have an idea which ones would be worth trying. The maps in the front of the book were very helpful, too."
2,A Bimbo's Delight,"If you are well, maybe a little shallow, maybe a little bit dim, maybe a whole lot narcissistic, well then, you can turn a city like SF into a spoiled child's paradise. This book will definitely appeal to some lovely dumbies, but to others, well, there's always the Eyewitness Guides."
1,Old News and Typos,"This guide is the absolute worst! I don't think the editors even proofread this thing before it went out (""Prada's other line: Mui Mui""). Give me a break! As an SF native, I consider myself a city insider and I can tell you that this guide is basically a ripoff of Splendora, the beauty and shopping webiste where I found my absolute fave facialist and masseuse three years ago. Coincidentally Jane recommends the same facialist and masseuse but my people have never heard of the authors or the book. The only thing savvy about this guide is (maybe) its cover but even that's a stretch."
4,Origen-Clasics of Western Spirituality,"This volume contains a good overview of the works of Origen, including ""An Exortation to Martyrdom,"" ""On Prayer,"" and selections from ""On First Principles,"" ""The Homily on Numbers,"" and more. The Translation is in clear, contemporary English. The introductory material is well writen and thorough, with plentiful notes. The text is annotated with cross references and biblical citations. This volume is exelently produced, as is the entire series."
5,Outstanding Instructional video for beginners!!,"This outstanding video takes most of the mystery out of setting up and maintaining a successful salt water aquarium. By acting as a visual guide, Jim Wolf takes you step by step through many important topics regarding the setup and maintenance of your salt water aquarium. By following the easy to understand instructions, you will be well on your way to becoming a salt water aquarium owner. Whether you are a beginner or are more experienced, this video will be a valueable addition to your video library.Highly Recommended"
3,Spider crazy,"I'm spider crazy, so of course I like them. They are a bit delicate though. Gotta be careful putting them on and taking them off."
4,Works very well for your ducts/furnace,Excellent aluminum foil tape that I used to replace old dried out tape on furnace ducts. Very sticky and works extremely well. Good value!
1,It's Not What it Used to Be,"For years I used a Garmin 48 GPS on my boat, but, as it happens it was stolen and I needed to replace it. While the 48 did not have soundings or coast lines it did have all aids to navigation with full descriptions. You could tell which blinking light was which. Place the cursor on the mark and it would tell you it was a FL R 10s (flashing red every 10 seconds). And this data was part of the base unit. Beware the ""basemap"" that comes with all Garmin units has almost no aids to navigation at all. And the ""Blue Charts"", while providing so much data as too make using a 20 mile view almost useless, DOES NOT CONTAIN LIGHT DESCIPTIONS AT ALL. A channel marker is only ""2"" or ""3"". So, buyer beware, the new Garmin products have less practical navigation value than the older units have."
2,"""O"" Really?","I found this product to be useful in most regular household application such as sink faucets, garden hoses, etc...However, their assortment did not contain anything that would accommodate myBig Black Penis: Misadventures in Race and MasculinityPerhaps I should have read their dimensions before ordering, but their return policy left a lot to be desired.after explaining to customer service the reason for my return, they were quite rude in telling me that I did not qualify for an exchange for a larger set of ""O"" Rings or refund any of my hard earned money.Very disappointed. However, I did use several on sink faucets and garden hoses and it did make the cap on myTuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl ozseal quite a bit tighter.2 stars"
1,this thing is useless!,Using this thing took longer than actually typing in the information myself! First the scanner only gets about 10% of the scan correct. Second it loads it into a database that for the life of me i could not get to transfer to outlook. Third there is no third i thru this in my box of crappy electronics that don't work!
1,"I hate this product, AMAZON should be ashamed to sell it!","Name is ""ColorPage-BR600"" implying color scanning and I thought it scanned in color, but I cannot get anything in color from this scanner, Also I cannot find support for this product! No documentation to help. Scan is very poor; I am warning you check before you buy, this must be the worst purchase I ever made from Amazon.com. Price is cheap but so is the result, I have wasted too much time. Amazon just lost me as a customer!"
4,Soweto Gospel Choir,"I loved the Soweto Gospel Choir when I saw them on TV and decided to order the CD. As a professor in a community college, I start my 3-hour classes with music, play music during breaks, and occassionally during various activities. I try to end the class with music, too. The student population is quite diverse; infact the students hail from approximately 30 countries of origin. Last week, to the students' complete enjoyment, I used this CD. Many of the students inquired where they could get it and wanted to see more than time permitted. (It is much more interesting than my lectures, I'm sure!) They, like me, enjoyed the vibrancy and beauty of the music, costumes, and dance."
4,GREAT ENTERTAINMENT,"The songs were captivating! I have enjoyed what I have seen and heard thus far. My mother was visiting me and I had ordered the dvd for her, it was wonderful indeed!!"
3,This costume is ok,"I purchased this costume for my daughter and she loves it, but complains the arms are itchy (the ""tulle"" used for the upper chest and arms are not padded and can scratch delicate skin). The ribbon that ties the skirt on is unfinished and unravels easily - it is worth taking half a second to put a few stitches in it or tie a knot in the end. The wings were very cute but did not stay on my daughter at all. I had to do some creative safety-pin work and they still didn't stand up well.It did hold up in the wash (the main dress) and she was able to run around in it all day and it did not fall apart. Not a bad costume, but be prepared to put a little elbow grease into it to make it all work, and I would suggest a body suit or same colored shirt to wear under the dress due to the scratchiness."
2,this book needs improvement,"i bought this book, believing the words of those who rated this book a 5 star....well.... the books is full of spelling mistakes, a few wrong answers, needless stuff.sure it covers a wide range of topics..but the topics that don't neccessarily come up in the test..and the explanations both for the reviews and the answers are INadequate...it leaves u with doubts and..""Huh....uh....""and belive me, i've taken AP calc and am currently in IB H1 mathit's not really a problem of my (or UR) understanding abilities... the book just can't explain them well."
3,"Good, but then not so good....","I just took a peek at my Math IIc score and I got an 800. Then the thought occured to me to write a review on the Math IIc review book I used. All I did was, 3 days before the test, crammed 2 hours for 2 nights, then the last night took a practice test and then did random questions in other practice tests.Warning: I am an experienced crammer!Now, on to reviewing the book. It covers all the topics you will need to know in a very organized fashion, although it was lengthy. Also there are a few errors here and there, which is why I gave it a 3. Some of the explanations are confusing for certain problems, but it's better to take a bigger picture of the overall topics than to waste valuable cramming time trying to figure something out, which may even be erroneous.If it worked for me, it can work for you!"
4,Sturdy - but heavy!,"Wanted for my RV... too heavy to justify.. just swapped in my kitchen for my light, white plastic home model. Again, nicely made and would be great for anywhere (this would be great on a picnic table... hold down the damn umbrella with it! ;-)"
4,One the best Atlas's I have ever bought,"This has got to be the best atlas I have ever found in its price range. I gave it a 4 because there are better ones out there for more money, but for this price it is really very excellent. An must for a Geography lovers library."
3,New Concise World Atlas,"I am very pleased with the Atlas, it is easy to use and very accurate. The size is perfect, magnifing glasses are not needed. I have had some trouble however identifiying & finding rivers & topographical features, perhaps they should be indexed also."
3,I am a Hogan's Heroes Fan,The complete Fourth Season is worth buying if you are a Hogan's Heroes fan but as each year in the series progressed I liked it less. The first year was by far my favorite. The series still makes me laugh and remember the times I watched it with my Dad.
4,Hogan's Heroes,We are fans of Hogan's Heroes and thoroughly enjoy each and every episode. We have the first four seasons and have ordered season five.
3,Good Idea but better if less science more characterisation.,"Follows the usual theme in J Chalker's books that everyting including identity is fluid.In this novel he appears to have decided to adopt a more hard science fiction approach as opposed to his more normal sod the science lets keep the plot moving style. This I believe has not added greatly to the interest of the book and has reduced its readability. However persevere there are some good ideas in there.It should be interesting to see how he develops the premise in books two and three.In this books he is addressing the same Zeitgeisty theme as Sliders, Quantum Leap, and Hard Questions by Ian Watson"
2,For beginners only.,The book is just that . . . some riffs. I cannot really say I got my money worth.
2,"They're OK, but you should save your money.","Don't bother with the Paraflexx sheets for fruit leather - unbleached silicone parchment paper (NOT waxed paper) is faster and less expensive, and you can just cut and store the finished leather with the paper still on. We did a lot of trial and error, and now we just line the bottom of the dehydrator with the Paraflexx to catch drips."
2,Not blown away...,I didn't finds this title as interesting as some of the other GGW videos. (I just got done watching it and almost wish I had ordered a different one.) I got it simply because I went to Cancun for spring break and wanted to see it all over again. The camara work isn't the best and the wet t-shirt contests aren't the best either. It will give you a taste of what spring break is really like in cancun because I felt like i was there again. I just cannot stop thinking that this DVD could have been much better!!!
3,Relaxing and Funny,"From a relaxing point of view, this DVD fulfills its requirement.It's fun, and you can enjoy the craziest things that teens and women can do.It's perfect for a pre-bachelor's party"
5,"Great Read, Great Pics, & Great Recipes","Not only does this cookbook have great recipes spanning from salads and sandwiches, to tarts, cookies (best ginger cookies i've ever had), scones, quickbreads, etc etc; but it is a feast for the eyes as well. The full color pictures make you hungry, and the simple straightforward writing and recipes make everything seem doable. I tried madelines for xmas presents (one of those wanted to try but never had recipes) and they came out just like the picture and tasted heavenly! Everything I've made has been delish and I keep finding more in there I want to try. Now if I could just find enough time to try it all!"
4,good place to start,"I thought that it was a volume 2 to ""walking for pleasure exercise"" but it is really a revision of it. So either one is sufficent, no need for both books by this author. Covers the topics needed to get a good start on exercise walking, a little bit more on diet than the earlier book.Informative, straightforward, no surprises nor bad advice, a worthy start to any walking library."
3,Not very comfortable,"I purchased these from Amazon.com, without trying them on ahead of time. The style looked almost identical to the Airwalk Sunny Thong, which sadly has been discontinued. The footbed on those is very soft and comfortable. I thought these Crocs would be the same, but the footbed is very hard, no cushioning at all. Not real great for someone with sensitive or painful feet, so keep this in mind. If you don't mind a 'solid' feel on the bottom of your foot, you'll like these.The fit otherwise is very good, and I like how the strap is raised, and not real tight, on the top of my foot. They seem to be well made, and should last awhile."
2,Desperately seeking for crocs athens sandals that would fit,"The other reviews are accurate, these sandals run big esp. the straps are so wide,These sandals sizes are messed up. I ordered the mens 4/womens 8 size, and let my son who wears a 10.5 tried them on, it fits him perfectly. So what's up with that? And this are made from China. So is this authentic? Probably not. Comfort wise, they're comfy. I just wish they make their sizes accurate. I also ordered them in pearl/charcoal. Don't be fooled with the color on the screen. They are not white or beige color straps, it is gray. Hope this helps..."
1,Very disappointed,"I wish I had read the other reviews before ordering. I ordered two pairs of these crocs in the size I and my mom usually wear and our size according to the sizing chart on the Crocs website, but they were two sizes too big. I had to return them and am now out $5 (for return shipping) and have nothing to show for it. The product description should include a warning that the sandals run large. I bought Crocs in the Baja style instead and they fit much better."
3,Good... but VERY buggy.,"Does set a nice mood and does have some scary parts, but the game is VERY buggy, even after the patches. Examples:Player can unavoidably take damage during cutscenes, even if trying to skip them (screen black and AI's are active during this time on boss battles).Ambience sound effects can play over the dialogue so it's hard to figure out the plot.Team members can get stuck in their ""...out"" animations after they calm down.Bad texture seams in characters faces.Dead bodies which include wall textues (blood streaks) are not lined up on the wall; so the ""blood streaks"" are haninging out in mid air.All of this really breaks the mood that they are trying to set. All of this could have EASILY been caught with a good test department, and wasn't... that's disappointing."
5,Prison Break,OMG we were so SAD when this was taken off the air...why do they do that?? Take off the most Awesome shows...Looking back on the 1st seasons and made us realize how much we miss Prison Break..Thanks for such an Awesome Value!!
4,"Sexy, Violent, Funny!","I loved this show when it first aired and knew immediately that I would buy the DVD. I was disappointed that only seven episodes were released and I have not seen anything about the rest coming anytime soon. I mean how hard would it have been to put the whole season together? So I took off one star.This type of humor/violence is right up my alley. This is not a kids cartoon! There is mystery, intrigue, violence, sex, and lots of cool creatures. It does remind me a little of Superjail (which I love) so that is probably why I am drawn to this show.This show is a little kooky and not for everyone. I was really afraid there wouldn't be a second season of it. I am glad I was wrong."
4,Apple Cider,"This product was used with 'Aztec Secret IndianHealing Clay' to make a mask, and it is performingvery well with the powder."
2,Didn't do much for me,"I used it for about 3 weeks. Didn't notice much of a difference in any way. I bought it specifically for seborrheic dermatitis. There was a bit of improvement but not enough. I didn't like the taste much, even with mixing it in with stuff. So I won't be buying again."
5,"Great preventive, nutraceutical","I didn't start out with any health problems when I began taking Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar several years ago, neither chronic nor acute problems--I almost never get flu or colds--so I can't report on any miracle cures. So why do I take 1 tablespoon every day? Because I consider it tremendous preventive nutrition. It has an anti-inflammatory effect, which is crucial for health, and it aids digestion. As we get older, our body's production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach decreases, and the acidity of Bragg helps with that problem.Personally, I love the taste of this wonderful vinegar inV8 low sodium vegetable juice. Previously I had used lemon juice in my V8, but this is even better.Highly recommended1"
2,"Burning, Nasty Taste, Couldn't Get It Down","I can't comment on my experience with Bragg's ACV health benefits because I couldn't get enough of it down.I like eating spicy and tart things like whole lemons, but this was a whole other level. I tried to put it in a drink and it burned my throat too much to get more than a quarter of the drink down. My mom tried mixing it in a drink because it's supposed to help with menopause and she couldn't get it down either. She said it tasted horrible. So bad that even though she was suffering quite a bit with menopause, she couldn't finish drinking it. The only way I could use it at all was as a light dressing on a salad, but there are much better tasting options.Given the low price and all of the health claims I'm glad I tried it, but ultimately I had no luck."
4,Great brand,"Great Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar Unfiltered - 16 oz - LiquidBragg, you can drink a little bit with water, it helps with constipation and blood pressure, it can cause gastritis. I'm talking about my experience with this product."
1,I couldn't even make it through 10 mins..,"This was indeed the first time I wish I checked out the reviews first. I could deal with the low budget but the acting is not watchable at all. After seeing just a bit of the series, I had to see what people thought. Please save your money!!"
1,Debunked!,"Although there are SOME truth to the allegations of political and financial conspiracies in the film, all the allegations of similarities between Jesus and Horus, et. al have been debunked by a video entitled ""Exposing the Satanic Empire"" on Youtube. Apparently, the producer of that video did more research and interviewed more experts who said that D.M. Murdock/Acharya S. is either wrong or made the stuff up. Jesus said it best, ""Many will come in my name and claim that I am the Christ and will deceive many."" See Matt 24:5, Mark 13:6, Luke 21:8."
1,Disappointing....,"I have to say, I love her books... I was very eager to read another, and I was vastly disappointed. It was predictable, some of it was even hard to believe (like getting away with being a boy? what?), and it was like the heroine was perfect at everything she did! I found myself from page to page, shaking my head and hating the girl more and more. And the man she loves? If someone had done all the things he did to her to me? He would have to suffer BIG time. He was let off way to easy.Disappointing...."
1,Horrible!,"I don't even know where to begin...I guess I can start with the fact that the author tried. I can see where she wanted to go and what she wanted to say, unfortunately, she failed. The writing is just flat, the pace of the story is rushed and the dialogue between the characters boring. After 39 pages I just couldn't get myself to read any further. I used to force myself to finish any book I started thinking that there is always a chance it might improve...now I know that life is just too short for bad writing.Do yourself a favor, pick something else. Some suggestions are books by Stephanie Laurens, Kat Martin, Diana Gabaldon, JD Robb, Lisa Kleypas...there are plenty of great writers out there. Don't waste your time with this one."
4,Liked Book,"This is another in the series of Gordon L. Rottman military books that are well researched, written and illustrated.John D. BennettKaneohe, HI"
3,Belkin Travel Surge Protector,"This surge protector is big, bulky and heavy. But it is sturdy -not really good for travel as advertised cuz it takes up so much room in your netbook case. An inline surge protector would have been better. But then it only cost less than $8 so I can't expect much."
5,Slick design,"The plugs on each side allow 2 bricks to be plugged in at the same time. Folding plug prevents in bag snags. Have not used the phone/ethernet protection feature, like others have said, protect one or the other, not both at the same time and made for US 120V current only. Plugs fit a little tight in the outlets such that it may be easier to plug in devices first and then plug this into the wall, but that could just be my plugs. I always keep this with my laptop bag, it's small and light and never noticeable."
1,this game rocks,this game is cool because you can breed different dinosaurs and take pictures of different dinosaurs in a lookout.You can also build different structures.
3,Seconding David Wilner's Review,"He was spot-on. I read his review prior to purchasing this and bought it anyway because I wanted a lightweight, simple continuity tester so I didn't have to drag around a wiggy. Everything he said was correct. I had to take mine apart and re-crimp the lead. The probe is just pressed through a plastic piece that screws into the handle. I love Klein pliers and drivers but some of their gear is weak. All this being said, it does work."
5,"Pyscho-analyse super heroes, then kill them.","Marshal Law lives in a world where 1000's of men became super-powered in a futuristic equivalent of the Vietnam war. They were made to commit attrocities and this combined with the indifference, even fear of their government has left them homeless and bitter. This is scathingly funny, though it will be more to your taste if you have an anti-authoritarian streak, barely disguised versions of famous heroes are parodied to expose their dark underbellies. Marshal Law himself is hilariously obssessed with his hatred for the heroes. A familiarity with the heroes parodied is helpful to an appreciation of this wickedly brilliant story."
2,"an original idea, i'll give her that...","but her writing talent falters constantly throughout the book. It's so unbelievable, so fake, it really isn't worth it. She ruins a wonderful, inspiring idea with a bunch of silly names like 'fire-breather' for dragons, and 'shreddermouth' for a croc. Then you have this selfcentered, conceited little boy who won't shut up about 'me me me me me me!' so you get really annoyed and bored. I personally love dragons to death, and having them used as airplanes made me laugh. She had some wonderful creatures in there, and the whole idea of the divide was great, but she tried to make it too childish. Another little pet peeve of mine was that almost everybody's name was two things or items put together, like 'Snakeweed' or 'Stonetalon'; things like that. one or two is ok, but having practically everyone named like that is really annoying and confusing."
5,Outstanding!!!!!!,Well written and documented. Great account for anyone interested in going to Ranger Course. Personally had a hard time remembering my personal experiences through the course. Doesn't include the desert portion that I had when I went through. Bought the book to remember myself and to help a student interested in going into the now R.A.S.P. Process that they call it now. RIP was only about 3 weeks long in 1988 when I went through. I understand now that it is 8 weeks and called RASP. Recommend for those that wish to remember or help someone to get an idea to prepare for Ranger School. If that is even really possible. RLTW 2nd Bn 75th Ranger Regiment.
2,"Neat and useful, but out of date","The small size of this book, and a chornological organisation of key events makes it a very handy reference tool to India's history, especially for last 2000 years or so. You could also carry it around and dip into it whenever you have the time.But you also need to be careful. The presentation is out of touch with archaelogical findings and interpretations of the last 50 years or so. For instance, it refers to Aryan invasion theory, which has been abandoned by every historian, because there is no evidence of a massacre at the sites. The extent of the Sindhu-Saraswati civilation (Indus Civilation), 2.5 million square kilometres, mapped by the ASI is not mentioned.It also makes some religious booboos. For instance, talking of the Shiva Linga, it tells us that Hindus worshipped a 'phallus' at Somnath. Shiva Linga actually refers to an oblong stone, which symolises Shiva, as any Hindu scriputre will tell you.So buy it, but read it with caution."
1,"Fun Program on MTV, HORRIBLE DVD !!!","This DVD is 55 MINUTES LONG! 55 minutes of garbage, and I really liked the program on MTV. Sure would be nice if MTV just offered the program for sale by season. They say on their web site that is coming soon. Whether it is or not, DO NOT waste your money on this frisbee."
2,"If you liked the gameshow, you will NOT like the DVD!","I saw a one-off show broadcast on British TV and thought the blair-witch style gameshow was amazing. It had my eyes glued to the screen for the whole episode, and was scarier than anything I'd seen before. After searching around I got the DVD with high expectations but I have to say it was a dissapointment. The DVD only features about 6 dares, and at that you would expect them to be the best. They are not! The dares are spoiled by constant cuts to commentary from the contestants which means you can never settle into the action. The biggest downfall on the DVD is that it takes the freight out of the successful episodes. If you get a chance to see Fear on TV or know a friend that has any episodes, it's a must see. But as for this DVD, leave it on the shelf!"
1,Clips Galore!,"I was not impressed. I thought it would be more of the old ""Fear"" episodes but wasn't."
5,Excellent Ink -- Long-Lasting,"I have been using Sarasa pens for more than seven years and I can say with full confidence that these pens (particularly the fuchsia ones) are excellent. I purchased a dozen .7mm fuchsia pens about four years ago in order to use them for grading papers. The ink is never spotty and it writes until it's dry. I cannot speak for the other colors (sometimes certain pigments allow for smoother writing), but I know that I have never been disappointed with my pink pens. I hope they never stop making them!"
2,"Somewhat useful, but a bit out of date.","This book seems quite dated for its copyright date of 1990; it is somewhat inconsistent with the currently favored fresh-is-best and low fat cuisine. The use of canned soups in the recipes is surprising in light of the fact that they are on the `foods to avoid' list on page 28. Since the assumption is that greater quantities of tyramine cause headache, it would have been useful to have tables of the estimated tyramine content of each food. Then, one could better gauge how much can be tolerated without repercussion. Recent material available over the internet identifies more foods with high tyramine content, including onions, canned tuna, all nuts, and hot yeast breads. An updated version of this book would be most welcome."
3,ok,It took a while to get enough blood to fill it. I don't think I got the full reading because of the time it took to fill it. Reading at the doctor's office was off by 40.Instructions were easy to follow.
4,When your home network grows too big,"When my home network got too big, I decided to wall mount a Cat6 patch panel and 1gb router (see my other reviews).This wall mount works fine and has good manufacturer packaging. All the hardware seems to be of decent quality. The hinge comes in handy when I need to punch down a new connection.7/28/10 Update - Product still performs well."
2,CRAP,"I'm a HUGE Cactus Jack fan, but this DVD was very disappointing to me. I read the other reviews and they make valid points on why they think this is a good video, but unless you liked the old school WWF Superstars in the late 80's then you will think this video is awsome. The quality is crap, the wrestling is crap, you might as well get a video of Lief Cassidy because it would be just as exciting. They call this video ""No Holds Barred"" that is not the case at all. I've seen more hardcore in a Gilberg match. Overall i was very disappointed"
5,Great value!,"I was a little skeptical when I purchased this, since the price was so much lower than every other website I had visited. I expected to receive an opened bottle, or a knockoff version. When I opened the package, I was pleasantly surprised to find the real deal, in perfect packaging. This was a great value and I am extremely happy with my purchase."
3,"Good guide, but only for elementary instructor","It's quite a good book of ""teaching literature"", but for me an advanced pianist, and as a guide to ""performance literature"", it is quite unsatisfactory. For instance, even Bach's English Suites are not mentioned in this book at all! Especially if you've read some piano liturature books like in German (eg. Handbuch der Klavierliteratur by K. Wolters), you would feel this book relatively inferior. But it provides good information for the piano instructors indeed, like which repertoire is a good preparative study for another repertoire, etc. Acutally I would still suggest this book, because it is sufficiently informative for the basic piano instructors in my country."
3,"Durable case, placing shafts a little tricky","The case is rugged and durable. The only problem is placement of the dart shafts, as the shaft holders are a little tight and the points can pierce the material too easily. However, the points to not extrude outside the case, so you are still protected if you carry the case in your pocket.Not a bad little case for the price."
4,Another good Roe,Loved the story! I thoroughly enjoyed Roe's antics and her fierce side in this one! But the editing and formatting left quite a bit to be desired. It lacked the usual precision of other Charlaine Harris books.
2,too slanted,"First, I will be honnest. I have only red 80 pages of this book (about to give up).I go through hundreds of bios, but rarely have I red one as negatively slanted as this one.There is a lot of research and knowledge to it... And that is its best side... But the interpretation of the facts can be pretty scary if not right down wishfull at times.Everything is told in a negative fashion! With no love for the subject whatsoever.Nothing wrong with finding some negative side to anyone, I didn't expect a fan bio, onlya cultured and balanced one. It makes one wonder? Why spending so much time writting about someone unliked?Well... The author seems too personaly involved... Obsesed with a feminist agenda totaly incompatible with writting about Miller inteligently. It feels like a bio written by a scorned woman.Read this book if you like good facts, Tarot card quality interpretation and feel like being nagged for 300 pages..."
2,How can there be so many grammatical errors in the 8TH edition!?,"I must agree with one of the other reviewers in regard to the abundance of grammatical errors. It mystifies me how there could be so many errors in this - the 8th edition - of a book! In addition to grammatical errors there are frequent repeating sentences. For example the author may end one paragraph with a sentence, and then the next paragraph begins with the same sentence...this is not a transition! The content itself is very thorough - perhaps overly thorough, especially in the excessive number of statistics. Statistics stop being useful when perhaps four pages of a thirty page chapter are literally bullet-point lists of statistics. Overall, I believe I am learning from this book, but am certain there are a dozen other books that can do a better job in a more concise way. Perhaps edition 9 will be the lucky number?"
4,An Insightful Book,I found Susan's book to be fascinating in the revelations of possible and/or common meanings of symbols we all use. I can see it as an invaluable tool in understanding a child's self-disclosure. I appreciated her eclectic perspective and respect for religious symbols as well. It seems to me to also be a valuable tool in the interpretation of symbolism in dreams. An excellent and insightful book.
5,GREAT STUDY BIBLE,I LOVE THIS BIBLE. I HAVE JUST THE NEW TESTAMENT AND THIS IS THE WHOLE BIBLE. WHAT A STUDY TOOL ALL THE EXTRAS ARE.
1,This pillow is a joke!,"I could not believe it. This pillow is flat. I had to double it over to get any kind of volume. It is a total joke, one that ripped me off to the tune of $40."
5,a classic,It is a classic spanish book. i've read it so many year ago. it is still very good and for free
3,Critics Cuentos Excelente,HistoriaHistorExcelent story. The plot is intriguing and exciting. I will recommend this book to Hispanic people who likes good literature. I give 5 stars.
4,Lo recuerdo,"Leí los cuentos hace mucho tiempo, pero aún los recuerdo. Definitivamente tienen encanto y sustancia, de otra manera ya los habría olvidado. Me gustó."
5,Loved this product,This hinge was a lifesaver the hinge on my old clippers broke and I bought this to replace it and it worked perfectly
5,Laundry Cart - Triple Sorter,"This laundry sorter was exactally what I was looking for. It doesn't take up a lot of room in my small laundry room and it serves several purposes for me. I can take it from room to room to gather and sort laundry, I hang my hand wash laundry bag on it on the end, I can hang clothes up on hangers to dry on the bar and it has a storage shelf on the top. Perfect for the space minded person."
5,A compact laundry organizer and hang-dry rack,"I love this laundry cart! It was fairly easy to put together (took me about 20 minutes). It makes a cluttered space in my bedroom look neater. It also allows me to hang dry clothes, or lay them on the top rack to dry flat. And it's so easy to just grab the bag of darks or whites and throw the clothes in with no sorting! I highly recommend it."
1,Missing parts,"After taking everything out of the box, and organizing for assembly I realized that all four wheels were missing, and the tool that comes with it. The box seemed to have been opened before. I'm really upset because I was pretty excited about getting this organizer; it is something I had debated on for awhile. I am getting a replacement, and HOPING that the second go round will be much more successful."
4,"A very thick, non-greasy lotion","I've been using Lab Series Daily Moisture Defense Lotion for the past few years until I decided to give Anthony Logistics a try. I like that the Anthony Logistics product is not greasy, but the lotion is very thick, possibly because of SPF 20. It takes a little effort to work into your face, but once it's been properly applied, it feels like a very light lotion.I have used the Anthony Logistics all-purpose facial moisturizer and I personally found the scent of it to be off putting, so I am very glad that this has no scent."
3,I've been using this for years: Loved it. Till I tried something new.,"At just SPF15, I decided to follow the instructions of my dermo and go with something higher.He said SPF15 just isn't enough. So I switched to an oil-free face lotion with SPF 30 in it.White and yellow bottle. Do some searching. A bit more greasy at first but a much better result."
2,Greasy,Oil free doesn't make a difference. This stuff makes my face shine. I was looking for something more of a matte finish.
5,Great support,"I hurt my ankle playing basketball, got the ankle support and I'm very pleased with it. Great support and protection."
5,Just what I wanted,"I've broken both ankles, almost bought one, I bought two and they have been the right amount of protection for my needs. Remember, think about what you need and look up the details of the product, I got what I expected."
3,just another brace,"brace is a lot of work for a big guy to put on and off seems to have a little more support that regular braces. I needed it for golfing walking on uneven fairways and greens it gave a little more support but not what I'm looking for, taking off after golf when my foot was a little swollen was really tight even after I opened all the way, good for cutting grass,to much work looking for a simple brace."
5,Ankle Support,It is a very useful product. I play a lot of basketball and have injured my ankle many times. This brace has helped me during the game and helped support my ankle after I sprained it.
5,Recommended,"I didn't necessarily buy one from Amazon but I've always had issues with my right ankle. I was in marching band, soccer, and basketball so sprains, strains, twists, stepped on, sore muscles, tears you name it. My doctor gave me the exact same brace and it was like immediate relief. I had 2 other braces in the past and I had never not once felt the same relief. It's extremely comfy, rigid enough to provide protection, but flexible enough to move and participate in other physical activities. And it can fit in any show easily. Don't let the thin look fool you. Everything it describes hits the nail on the head."
5,good,it is very good i m so happy that i can buy a good stuff.very good stuff.and it protect me .very much
5,Love this,"I broke my foot several years ago, and then I sprained the same foot 7 months ago. I have had terrible ankle pain since, and I was not sure what product would work best. I don't have to wear this every day, but on the days where my ankle gives me a lot of pain, this is very comfortable and eases the discomfort. The price is great, and the product is awesome! Highly recommend!"
3,Wrong Order Received,"I have used this ankle brace before and I loved it. I needed a new one and in white because of my uniform. I was all excited to get them. I not only received the wrong ankle brace, but it was the wrong color as well! Good thing I only ode red one. Had the ankle brace been white, I would have kept it. Has this happened to anyone else or is it just me? Very disappointed because I really needed this for next week. Now the price has gone up $5 and i still need to order it.I give it 3 stars because the brace I received was great, it just was not what I was looking for."
4,good but...,"The Greatest Hits is not really, but culled mostly from his 90's period and 1 new song coupled with a few classics (for Kim anyway) including the ever popular Go For Soda. Now, onto the DVD. Since this is the only live video released by KM so far, it stands as a must have for fans. The problem with this video is that the camera spends TOO much time on the audience, and for no good reason. This is an 80's bar crowd, lots of mullets, big hair, nothing to see. By the end of the show, the camera is on the audience so much, you could forget who is playing if you turn the sound off. When Kim is soloing, you want to see him, not some knucklehead pumping his fist in the air. That said, audio and video quality are very good. One other complaint, the beginning of All We Are seems to cut into a solo already in progress by Kim."
5,Still Riding the Turtle's Back.......................,"I'm not a huge anime fan, but there was some great imagery here. Scenes linger in your mind, touching on some great memory you know you had but can't remember. You will begin to care abou the characters, and yearn to be part of their ""perfect world."" Dealing with how to cope with a natural (or unnatural, in this case) calamity is what makes this a survivalist's story: the ability to live and have fun doing it. Whoever made this needs to be acredited with making a modern masterpiece, because the experiance of watching Beautiful Dreamer is inspiring and intense. If you close your eyes you can almost see the broken ruin of Tomobiki high. I could see myself under the big sun above Tomobiki, listening to funky 80's japanese pop while taking in a beefbowl with a smile on my face, waving to Lum and Ataru as they tear up the lake in their Kawasakis."
3,Good condition but Video is not in English.,I recently purchased this VHS video for my Son It came in the mail quick and in good condition but he's NOT happy because it's in Japanese with english sub-titles and the seller did'nt state this when he or she was selling it.
3,Not the best Urusei Yatura,"Unfortunately, for me, this movie didn't portray the wacky, loveable characters nearly as good as the television series did. If you get a chance, check out the television episodes. Now those are funny."
4,Challenging,This game challenged my very logic and strategy skills to their limit and it was a pleasure to play.
2,Could of been better,"This game is not very good for many reasons.1.the touch screen controls can be finicky.2.The sailing that occurs in the game is downright boring and very time consuming and you can't just leave your DS alone since they are enemies who attack you while your sailing.3.Some of the puzzles are very frustrating and not fun at all4.During the game you are going to have to return to the same dungeon over and over again, which means you have to go through the same area again just to unlock a new area. This can get tedious considering some of the things you have to do are really stupid like carrying key pieces from 1 point to another all while trying to avoid enemies you can't even kill. To make things worse the moment you enter this dungeon, a timer appears so you have to do it in a certain time. i don't know what nintendo was thinking when they went with this design choice but overall it pretty much destroys the game, dooo noooot buuuuuuuuy!"
5,Big hit with my Grandson,I don't know much about these games but I can tell you my 12 year old Grandson called me several times to tell me how he was doing with the game and how much he liked it.
5,panamaleo,"ok the delivery was perfect, i did what i want i have the game before everyone here :P at least i think and imagine i'm a big fan of zelda adventures the twilight princess was a huge upset for me but this game manthis game did it i think is maybe the best of zelda games for now.... they did it :DIs the perfect Game"
4,Good game... but,"Everyday I have a long commute on a train I have to take to and from work so I play my DS a lot to pass the time. I got Zelda since I've been a long fan ever since the first good ol' NES version. I thought this Zelda was a good game, but I couldn't possibly play it on the train. Even though I had the sound turned all the way down in certain spots music still came out of the speakers! Also, people look at me weird when I have to start blowing at my DS, I wish there could have been a button option to replace the blowing. And only being allowed to use the stylist made my wrist start to ache after awhile. It would of been nice if I could have had the option to be able to play off the D pad for at least some of the game, all of the buttons besides the power button are utterly useless.Now with all that said, this is a great game... I just wish the developers could have designed this game with the above mentioned in mind."
1,"""Brainless product of a third-rate amateur""","Don't waste your time, even if the plot seems promising. It is not. There are no bright moments there at all. I've endured this book to the end, and deeply regret the wasted time."
2,"Tastes Good, Hidden Surprise","These taste great, I was eating them for years.As I said, was.Unfortunately, Quaker is using partially hydrogenated oil (in English, that means trans fats).While they claim 0g Trans Fat, they're rounding down anything below .5 grams. There's no way to know if each bar has .1g or .4g... Quaker won't say.All those .4g add up in a day, as everyone touts ""0g trans fat"". So, in all, I had to stop eating them. Quaker Simple Harvest bars do not appear to have any trans fats, and I suggest those as an alternative. Unfortunately, they're much harder to find... and more expensive."
4,Works Just Fine,"This light seems a bit bulky, but it works great and it's hard to find anything similar to it. We leave it on all the time-- the light goes off until dusk, then comes on at app. half-power until dawn. If it detects motion, it goes to full power. Note that the electronics in the round part that attaches to the wall takes up too much space for the wiring to fit inside. You'll definitely need an electrical box of some kind in the wall to house the wires. (This makes it unlikely that you'll be able to just bolt it to a brick wall.) I had to cut out a portion of plastic siding with a knife and do a lot trial-and-error before I could attach the light successfully; it was a pretty big pain in the butt, actually."
2,Hard to read,"Bought this phone for the bedroom - and liked what it said about it so much that i bought one for my sister as well. when you wake up in the middle of the night to answer the phone - well, it's hard to see - buttons are teeny, caller id screen is small - even when i turn on the lights hard to read - not currently using (neither is my sister)"
4,Women - experiencing,"This is a collection of experiences that come from women who are a cut above the norm. The stories include travelling experiences, but they are more about centered, courageous women who are paying attention to the life around them. Short, but well written, inspiring stories."
2,O.K. Debut Novel but Needed Better Editing,"This is the story about three sisters, two of whom are estranged from the third. One is an author, one is a school teacher and I couldn't quite figure out the occupation of the third sister. The story essentially revolves around the relationship between the sisters and the sisters relationship with others. Although I thought the story had potential, I felt the author approached the issues presented in the novel in a rather simplistic and pedantic manner. I would like to have seen more development of both the characters and the various storylines. In reading the novel, the characters were pretty one dimensional and all of the main characters seemed to focus upon was the presence and love of a man. Additionally, the poor editing detracted significantly from the novel."
4,a great inexpensive filter,"I've had this filter system for about 6 months after using the Brita and Pur pitcher filter systems. Haven't had any problems with leaking. We have a very standard (basic model) kitchen faucet, so that may have something to do with the filter mounting more easily for us and not leaking.While I don't think the water from this faucet mount system tastes quite as sharp/refreshing as the water from the pitcher filters, it does effectively remove the chlorine and bad tastes from our tap, and it definitely makes cooking/filling pots with filtered water easier. I like to use the Pur pitcher for cold drinking water from the fridge, and the faucet filter for making coffee, cooking, etc. It works perfectly.If you have terrible-tasting water of questionable cleanliness like we do here in the Nation's Capital, I think this is a great, inexpensive option. It's also the best option for renters who can't install a serious under-cabinet or whole-house filtering system."
5,Good Expansion,"This is a great expansion to Guild 2. It adds more optoins to what you can do in the game. Very fun to play with friends and the replayability is outstanding. It is a little buggy, but what new game isn't?"
