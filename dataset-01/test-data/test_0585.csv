3,A two-piece orange suite in a blue jacket,"""And a silver belt buckle with his initials in green jade acrosss in face. ... Can you see it? Do you get the picture?"" And no, he is not out of business.For me it is a number of good ideas and a hard sales pitch. Next time less pitch more workout please."
5,A Must Read if You Want to Own a Buisness,"This book opened my eyes to what I was doing wrong and very shortly after putting these principals into practice, everything turned around for us. I highly reccomend it to anyone who owns, or is thinking about owning, their own buisness."
1,Old 1995 Book,"Old book that does not even mention the internet. While systems are important in a business, it must be run using new technology tools otherwise you are out of business fast because your competitor will take market share from you. This was a good book in the 1990's but not now. Because of the forms in the back of the book it appears to be a lead generation tool for their $12000 per year consulting program."
1,Infomercial,"Useless - this was just a long commercial for the author's services. Worse yet, I paid for it. Very little concrete information. Very disappointing."
2,Should have been a pamphlet.,"This book provided some good insight into common business assumptions. Gerber has some good points, but had trouble putting them into a book. The dialogue was forced, dull, and extremely repetitive. This book could use a lot of editing.The book seemed more like a sales pitch for his company. He listed all the pros of his methods and beliefs, but didn't address any negatives. His fictional character Sarah left the impression she would believe anything he said. Why doesn't she question anything he suggests? She just bought into everything he said.Did McDonald's pay him to write this book?"
2,Author should have been a fiction writer,There's a few good ideas in this book. The best that a business should be thought of as a product you develop so that it can run without you. These good ideas could have been summed up in about 10 pages. Instead the author goes off on tangents that are 100% unrelated and he tries to show off how good he is at crafting literary prose in little fictional stories. VERY DISTRACTING. All the raving reviews could only be a hoax.
5,FOCUSED ON WHAT BUSINESS SHOULD BE ABOUT,"TERRIFIC BOOK, I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE THAT I COME IN CONTACT WITH THAT IS STRUGGLING WITH THE BASIC PROBLEMS OUTLINED IN MICHAEL'S BOOK. MY THINKING WAS CRYSTALIZED BY THE IDEAS IN E-MYTH AND THE EXAMPLES OF HOW AND WHY THE GREATS ARE GREAT. THE CONTINUED READING AND LISTENING TO THIS STUFF KEEPS ME FOCUSED ON BUILDING MY BUSINESS WHILE I AM DOING BUSINESS. THE VERY BEST BOOK, AND OTHER GERBER MATERIALS, THAT I HAVE READ. THE DIFFERENCE IT HAS MADE IN MY THINKING, IN ME AND MY BUSINESS IS INCREDIBLE."
5,Good systems,"I liked this book because it uses system to create business processes. These business processes are used to manage and operate a franchise business.It focused mainly on franchises even though the same concept lends itself to other type of businesses. So far, the e-myth, Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, Stop Working by Rohan Hall seem to be the best on the market. They have similar concepts though applied differently."
3,"a few interesting and though-provoking things, otherwise not impressed","I did not really learn anything, but just obtained a different perspective on his take on what is required to succeed in building a business. He said a few interesting and though-provoking things, which allows me to cautiously recommend. I did not like the writing style in this book; his paragraphs did not flow and I found the book hard to read. I read it in 2 sittings, so it was not a long book."
1,smokin' crack,"I started reading and thought this guy might have some interesting ideas about how to manage a business. As I read, a few items I disagreed with, then more and more until I decided he must be living in some purple haze, academic, sterile laboratory. Then he freely admitted to being a dopehead. Mystery solved!!I've managed and owned several successful businesses myself and his ideas are a quick way to stifle any creativity and suppress any ambition your personnel might have."
2,Terrible Audio Version,"Given the great reviews and recommendation for this book, I may have gotten more out of it had I read it. But I listened to the Audio version. It was terrible. I bought it for a car trip and I wanted to hang myself after listening for an hour or two. The author has a slow nasal whining delivery that drove me crazy. Every time he over aspirated the word ""pie"", which he must have said nearly one thousand times because his example was a pie store, I felt like I needed to wipe spit from my face.I actually deleted the file from my player. It was so horrible I knew I would never listen to it again."
5,Most valuable business advice I've ever read...,"This book emphasized concepts I thought about and even started before, but had never seen articulated like this. Gerber's style really pulls you into the message and makes E-myth an interesting and personal read. I finished it in 2 sessions - I couldn't put it down! The book really made me see my business in a different light and will change the way I operate from here on out. A previous reviewer mentioned that systems stifle creativity. NOT TRUE. As a matter of fact, systems are quite liberating. I run a creative business and systems allow us spend more time doing our jobs (being creative) and less time figuring out HOW do our jobs. At any rate, E-myth is the single most valuable piece of business literature I've ever read. Period."
1,All fluff,"I have no idea why this book is so highly rated. Like most of the folks who rated it two or less, I encountered a few a snippets of wisdom, but the book is mostly fluff. Removing the superfluous content may yield an interesting pamphlet."
3,Dilbert Material,"The primary point of this book - that most small business people spend too much time on the technical details of their business and not enough on developing a scaleable, repeatable business model - is well presented and a point that is certainly worth making. I really liked this first half of this book. However the second half revealed Gerber to be some sort of a paperwork/control freak who proposes systems so burdensome and detailed that they would stifle most real small businesses and insult most employees beyond recovery. This isn't terribly surprising coming from a consultant. A lot of the material in this book would fit nicely in a Dilbert cartoon."
3,"A good 20 pages book, inflated to be a bad 270 pages book","After reading many books in my life, I have noticed several things.Most books are about 200 pages long.and all books split into 1 of these 2 categories:1. Books that are 200 pages and contain 200 pages of content.2. Books that are 200 pages and contain 10 or 20 pages of content, (the rest is inflated, 180 or 190 pages of bubble gum that is being chewed and chewed, so the writer can say ""I have a 200 pages book, pay me a full price"").This is the feeling I have from this book.The 20 pages of content are good,the rest is horrible and irrelevant, and it wastes my time.I would prefer to pay a full price of a book and get some small thin notebook of 10 pages, and read it straight, rather than having my time disrespected and wasted."
2,"Good start, fails in the second half","Although this book started out with some great ideas, by the middle I was tired of the self-promoting and sappy style. In fact, I could not read the second half at all. I tried to ignore the writing style and get to the meat, but the book was ruined by too many personal stories and pontification when I was looking for straightforward, solid business practices. Some of the basics are there, but they are hidden in a sea of mush."
4,Recognize your Role,"Michael Gerger does a wonderful job of illustrating the trials and frustrations of starting your own business. By breaking down the component roles of the business into three facets.1. The Entrepreneur2. The Manager3. The TechnicianGerber helps us ""see"" the different roles we must assume simultaneously while building our business.The main takeaways are... Build your business with a purpose, Systematize your procedures for success, and Plan every aspect of your business so it harmonizes with your ultimate purpose for your business.I found this book to be very interesting, inspirational and easy to read. Gerber personalized his ideas to the point where I could visualize the story as it unfolded. I recommend this book for everyone who is either thinking about starting a business or has already jumped in and found themselves in over their heads."
4,E-myth revisited essential for success,"This book is a must read for any ""technician"" going into business for him/herself. Save yourself a lot of heartache, time and money by reading this book before you open for business. This book has answers to questions that you haven't even asked yet as well the questions you're trying to answer right now."
4,Very Good Toothbrush,"I like this toothbrush very much overall. I used to use the Sonicare (the original one, not the Elite. I guess the Elite is supposed to be new and improved) although the Sonicare sent and unplesant ringing and tingling sensation through my mouth and face. The Sonicare seemed to work just as well as the Oral-B except the Oral-B doesn't have the unpleasnt tingling. My dentist recommends any Oral-B electric toothbrush over the Sonicare and ever since I switched to an electric he has been very pleased. He never noticed a difference bewteen the Sonicare and Oral-B, but he still recommends the Oral-B."
2,"Well, I Read It....","My problem with this book was not the graphic content. Although it did bother me at first, after the first few chapters, I got use to the writer's sick and graphic nature. What I found to be the weak point in this book was the writing. It was amateurish at best and lacked that certain something that makes a writer a writer. The basic plot was a good idea and I applaud the writer's effort, but his writing did little for me and I doubt I'll be picking up another Tim Waggoner book again. Now I can see why he's failed to top any bestseller lists and why he hasn't had any type of recognition. The writing skills he possesses are rusty and need to be oiled before being put to the test again.I suggest you look a little harder for a book, instead of picking this one up. If the writing doesn't irk you, then the obscene and very graphic language will."
1,Sea Essentials Vital...disappointment,"I bougt Sea Essentials product few months ago and it was great.The new as they say "" improved formula "" is totally diffrent .I poured it out straight to the toilet.I wasted over 50$ ."
5,Vampire Diaries season 2 review,"The dvds I ordered were all in great condition and has a booklet with the list of episodes on each disc,such an amazing show!"
5,for my collection,I love this show and had the first season and had to finish my collection so I bought this it is great
5,such a rich story,The writers of this show are amazing as this story is so multifaceted. I love the vampire brothers and root for them both to find love. This is the only booked based show that makes me want to avoid the books so it won't taint my love for this story and world. TvD is Brilliantly done and I will remain a loyal fan til the last episode.
3,Vampire Diaries Complete 2nd Season,The set was missing a CD and after I told Mark he gave me the money back.I have nothing negative to say about him at all and will buy from him again.Thank YouLinda Collier
3,did not like as much as the first,"I really liked the first series, but I guess as with other seasons the plot gets kind of old and boring. I have not even finished this series."
5,Vampire Diaries is soo AWESOME! and a must see show!!,"For anyone who love the Twilight series, you have to watch this show!! It is full of drama,romance,action, and soo many sexy characters:) After I watched the first episode of the first season I was hooked and since bought the season and have watched it over and over. Can't wait to get the second season!!"
5,Great Show,"I started watching this show while babysitting my boyfriend's 13 yo little sister and ended up liking it almost as much as she did. I had read the books and frankly it was one of the few series that I had to drop. This show is different from the books. Elena, for one thing, is not the selfish, obsessed brat that she was in the books. Finally a female character (in the recent vampire teen dramas) whose life doesn't revolve around having a boyfriend and who cares about her family and friends (yes, I am talking about Twilight). As a fan of the genre, I really liked this show, it seemed to get better and better with the new season (unlike True Blood, sigh...). There are no LONG boring scenes with no dialogues in this show and the writers are not afraid to kill off characters in order to move the story forward. That's always refreshing!"
5,Vampire diaries season 2,Amazing! This is the best show you can watch right now and every episode just gets better and better! I can't wait to see what comes next!
2,Hard going,"This book is written in an extremely hard to read style, with long and convoluted sentences.The writing style is almost unbearably boring. It you thought Hardy's ""Return of the Native"" was too fast paced, this is the book for you!It also tends to explain the micro details without clearly explaining how it all fits together. In this respect, it almost assumes you have read and understood the Device Driver Kits, although the reader will be generally looking for help getting started with the DDKs.There also seem to be a lot of omissions, in that it does not do a very good job of getting you started. Want to write a winmodem driver? This book gives you no idea where to start.Having said all that, you probably need this book if you are writing a WDM driver. It does have a lot of useful information and tips. However it assumes you are a guru already."
5,Ideal for your PET RAT,"I know the item description indicates this item for ferrets. I can't see a ferret running a wheel myself but I do have two pet rats who totally delight in this wheel. They run on it constantly. I also have a guinea pig who will sit on the wheel but that's all. It is not a guinea pig ""thing"". Five stars for the appropriate use of this item. It's not the item's fault that it doesn't get used properly."
3,"Fair Sound, Great Microphone","This is definitely not what I expected. It has ""simulated"" surround sound, and it requires AA battery if you want to simulate surroundsound. The battery lasts about a week if you use it constantly, 12 hours a day.In all honesty, it is more of an echo than surroundsound. To me, it sounds like any other headset, just a bit louder. The microphone however is really good. I use Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8.0, and I noticed a tremendous accuracy increase when using this headset.IMPORTANT NOTE TO PEOPLE WITH GLASSES:The cup ear pieces press the glasses into your head. After about two hours, it gets quite uncomfortable. They fit very very snug around the ears, but this causes the ends of the glasses to poke into your head behind your ears. The headset is also quite tight, even after adjusting it.To sum it up, the sound is fair, and the microphone is great."
5,Better than expected...,Great product at a great price. I just installed them today. I ordered 2 and they came with covers and wire connectors pre-attached too.
4,great light,The lights arrived in a timely fashion and with necessary hardware though the casing said they were 55w bulbs not 100w like online. either way it took some work to get them installed since it was already a tight fit to begin with but the work great when driving at night to light up a long dark section of road. I would recommend these as a great budget light and wouldn't even consider paying the extra cash for a brand name light.
5,awesome book to do review on your own,It requires a good ton of previous knowledge. The problems are excellent and worth knowing. Some of the terms the author uses are very old but this book is printed in 60's.
2,Not believable,"As hard as I tried to take this book seriously, I just can't. The evidence she provides to suggest the Romanovs bones were not authentic fell flat on its face, making the rest of the book do the same. And better yet, she places much of her reliance on a book written in 1920 called ""Rescuing the Czar"" which suggests the Imperial Family were rescued through a ""secret tunnel"" under the Ipatiev House. I'm sorry Ms. McNeal, but there's got to be more to convince me. 2 stars for effort!"
1,Rehash of old information,Sorry the theory that is put forward in this has been out there for years. It is a rehash of material used back in the 70s. Except for the DNA reference everything has been written before.I was very disappointed concidering the publication was continually backed up. I really looked for something new and exciting something that may even have convinced ME. I would sayif you are going for information for this subject go with the pros like Mr. Robert Massie and Mr. Edvard Radzinski.
1,The Worst,"I previously had 2 Black and Decker under the counter can-openers. They worked great! This particular one had not worked but 3 times since I got it over a month ago. I would have taken it back but threw the box away thinking it would work since the previous ones I had worked. I have been using my $2.00 hand- held opener and at least they get opened. I will never buy anything else from Black & Decker!!! What happened to the days when you could trust a Brand Name???? As far as I'm concerned, it shouldn't have one star!!!"
2,autoazore,I purchased this product for my father on 4-21-2010. It didnt come with any instructions or hardware for installation. I had to go down to te hardware store and buy some screws. Also the handle to operate the product was too close to the bottom of the cabinet. I think there should be a spacer included between the can opener and the cabinet. It works fine but I think for 50.00 total it should have come with instructions and hardware. I would not recommend buying this product.
1,Only lasted 2 months,"I bought this at Walmart and was happy with it for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks it sounded like it was barely making it around each can. Than it got louder and sounded like it was moaning ""ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR gRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRg aRRRRRRRRRRRR"" and would only make it half way around the can. Finally it just died, well it still moans a little when you attempt to open a can, but it will no longer have anything to do with actually opening a can....it's dead.... What a piece of junk....."
4,Dead on Arrival but replaced at no charge. I am Happy!,The canopener was just what we wanted and the price was right. It came quickly but alas it was Dead on Arrival. Called Black and Decker and they replaced it. Took two weeks but alls well that ends well. Can opener works great
4,Pre-K & Kindergarten,"The book itself is very nice quality. The pictures are cute cartoons, but the dot-to-dot ""work"" isn't very interesting, nothing tricky, just straight lines. A good activity book for 4-5 year olds, but not for older kids."
3,Another fine work from a true poetic master.,"Robert Penn Warren, Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce (Random House, 1983)Warren's penultimate book of poetry, published as he was nearing eighty, is less something to be criticized or examined as it is to be learned from. Warren, seventy-five at the time of this long poem's writing, had been in the game for over a half century, had won the Pulitzer three times (as well as most other major prizes known to man), and was one of the last century's most influential writers on many fronts. Forget nitpicking, and just learn from one of the few Americans who has truly earned the title of ""master"" in the poetic realm. ***"
4,A little worried at first,"I have two cats (9 & 10 mos) and I decided to go cold turkey as far as switching their boxes. After a week I haven't had any problems with them going outside of the box. My male cat is already about 12 lbs and is quite big and he squats over the hole just fine. The first couple of days he would pee on the seat, however if accidents occur their are slots in the seat for it to go through. I think it is an adjustment for them, however it is a much cleaner option as opposed to having a full sized box because they stand on the seat and not inside the soiled litter, which also helps to prevent tracking litter on the floor. If you own more than one cat it is better for them to each have their own box, and for the box to be cleaned every day due to the small size. Paired with the Petmate Litter Locker I think it works great."
3,Promesas inconclusas,"Este no es un disco que Soda pensó en sacar. Es más, los que conocen al grupo saben que no sacaría un disco con ese nombre teniendo los temas que tiene....Son versiones que tenía la discográfica y que decidieron sacar para hacer un dinerillo. Como no tenían como completarlo, en primavera cero le subieron unos sonidos y les bajaron otros y para terminarlo le agregaron temas que ya habían salido en Languis o Rex Mix.Se notan que son lados B que quedaron en el aire y quizá esto justifique el hecho de comprarlo.Mas allá de las críticas al origen del disco rescato a ""zona de promesas"" y la versión de la ciudad de la furia."
3,Bill Moseley is fantastic,Moseley was a joy to watch. He literally stole the film and it was disturbing and wonderful at the same time. The rest of the film was good and followed a good pace. I'd recommend this film to any horror fan because it was not as bad as other independent horror films out there.
1,Pile of poop,This movie is not weird gory or cool. It just seems like some dorks with money made some crap movie with lots of things that uncool people would think it would be cool to say. This movie just sucks don't watste your time or money. what a let down for synapace
4,El regreso de Spinetta a sus raíces,"Este disco doble nos presenta a un Spinetta de vuelta a sus raíces, con una música dura y desgarrada. Derrocha originalidad, fuerza, aunque con algunas piezas desiguales. Buena producción y mejor sonido. Para los que gustan del Spinetta de las guitarras chirriantes y el rock básico."
5,Spiritual,"Hiscano's work is like a prayer. He evokes the creator and holds man to the side for a moment. By leaving us outside the frame, he touches us deeply. We remember our source and claim it as our heritage.Dwights photographs have the power to heal."
5,Every household needs this book!,"I got this book as a Secret Santa gift. After one night in the kitchen, I went nuts with all the recipes. They are all written so simply! They don't take too many ingredients. And I use my judgement on how healthy I want to cook. If I want a lower-fat meal, I just use a bit of butter/oil.It has recipes from all over the world, Scandenavian cookies, potato pancakes, Jewish Apple Cake, pork friend rice, not too mention traditional Soul Food dishes. Also, I have a lot of experience in West African cuisine, and the traditional dishes are very similar.You don't need to be of a certain race/culture to use this book! Most dishes are ready from 30 mns to 1 hour."
4,Ummm Ummm Good!!!,"I love this book. My daughter brought it home from her school library. I loved it so much that I had to buy a copy to keep. I have made several of the recipes, and all I can say is YUM!!!!"
2,Accessory Kit is ehhhh,"the things that i liked about this kit was the 4gb sd card and the nikon bag. the tripod felt a little too much like a toy from what i'm used to, and the battery is 3rd party. it doesn't last long at all. the card reader is okay but isn't as nice as the one in the picture shown. The software given is pretty much useless and everything else is practically not needed especially if you are like me and prefer to get genuine products for your camera. to some it all upPros:4GB SD ChipNikon Bag is big enough to carry a few lenses with the camera and a few more accessoriesCons:plastic feeling tripodgeneric spare batteryeverything else is not needed."
2,"Hey, wha happened?","This album lacks the musicianship of their other releases. I understand what they were trying to do, but the cd is more about the producer than them. Little to no guitar, sax and keyboard solos and intricate melodies. Stanton must have been bored drumming the same hip hop beat through the whole cd. Just pick up any other of their studio stuff (or for that matter We Love Em Tonight) and rock out. Unless you're more into the hip hop scene and less funk, jazz, and new orleans style."
1,Excellent for the beginner.,"David Holt starts with how to hold and tune the 5-string banjo and progresses from there. For the beginner, this is an excellent place to start. He describes and displays instructions that are clear and concise, then leaves plenty of time for you to practice and play along. His good humored approach is refreshing and easy to follow. It's like having a friend in the room, sharing his joy of playing, and helping you learn."
3,"OK, but not great","I think Intel should warn Windows XP users that even with new drivers, the dual-core is lost. If they're lucky (without overclocking a lot) Windows XP will read the processor as a single 1.9Ghz."
5,Bring on season 3,"I have just finished watching season 2 and will be buying season 3 in the near future.I recomend this series to any fan of GOOD BRITISH TV.Plus it reminds me of the days when I did the car boot (Flea markets) sales looking for that item that might be worth a bit of money,I did find a few!!!!"
5,The divvy extraordinaire,"Lovejoy is always entertaining, sometimes funny and occasionally romantic. Imagine someone with a sixth sense regarding true antiques who just can't seem to do well in the trade. He is always chasing the elusive great antique item and usually falling a little short, mostly because someone needs the money or whatever more than he. He skirts the law and often brushes it a little too close, but in the end right will out, even if it does not favor him. You will enjoy the antics and maybe learn a little about antiques in the process."
3,"Easy to use, fill and works well, outside is plastic.",Guess I did'nt read the description well enough. All in all I do like them just was expecting a little more.
4,+Easy twist; -no serving tray,"Great mechanism--even easier to twist than the original barrel-twist pepper grinder from Unicorn. Simple to fill, simple to adjust, simple to use. Perfect. I do wish it came with a serving tray, like the 6"" magnum pepper grinder, as it does shake a bit of extra ground salt from the milling teeth every time you set it down. If it came with that tray, it'd be 5-star! Since it is 2"" OD, a white, PVC pipe cap may do the trick."
3,doesn't work with Verizon XV6700,"Only plays in one ear for the Windows Mobile XV6700, so most likely the same for the Sprint 6700. Like all others, backing it out will get stereo. Not sure what the magic is for why this works on some phones and not others designed for a 2.5. We don't have this problem with hands free cell phone headsets, so why with headphone to cellphone plug converters?"
5,"good price, good product","for the price, i'am gonna buy another one for a spare. mine came with 6 plastic vials in stead of 3. these vials are long enough to hold 2 browning invector chokes and will hold one invector plus choke. excellent for sporting clays where you may want to change tubes at every station. the vials are a must, as my choke tubes are always greased up to the max. looks durable, but for the price, i'm getting a spare."
4,A perfect pouch,"Why anyone would pay more for a pouch to hold six chokes is beyond me. This pouch includes three vials, but if you purchased your chokes you already have vials and they fit fine. Also, even without the vials the chokes fit nicely into the elastic interior straps. There is a simple outdoor pocket where I keep my choke wrench that was well thought out. This is a good and serviceable choke pouch I think everyone would be happy with."
3,OK,This is a printed flag with acceptable quality. For the price it looks good. You can find better but it will cost more.
5,very cool,I love soviet collections and this was a great addition it is perfect for its price. It was bigger than i thought it was going to be but it was still worth it great flag.
4,Don't Know much about American History,I gave it as a gift to a 10 year old. Hope he likes it. It looked like a easy read.
2,Way too much audience sound...,I was amazed that the sounds from the audience were so much a part of the singing. The mic's had to be in the audience. Way too much screaming and overall audience sound. The three music videos included are very well done.I also thought that the advertising fo rthe new season of M-TV in the beginning of the CD was in poor taste. If you bought the CD don't you think you would watch the show? Really...think about it.
4,"If you like Letterman, you&#65533;ll like this book","My friend recommended this book to me after she read it. Andrew Harter is a *very* funny writer (I admit I have a demented sense of humor.) As you can see from the reviews some people don't get it. If you like Letterman, you'll like this book. If not, you won't get it. It's very hip. He's a real person that explains the reality of filmmaking on NO budget. His story about buying a wheelchair for his movie at the thrift store killed me. It's also very encouraging. He makes you want to go out and make a movie. He also helps explains why certain movies work and others don't. I recommend this and Rebel Without A Crew."
3,This was embarassing,"I'm sorry, the Moody Blues are one of THE great music groups in rock in my opinion, but this one made me want to cry. Why do they need shapely backup singers? Aren't their voices good enough??? I found that some of their numbers (i.e. 'Ride My See-Saw') just DON'T sound good with an orchestra. Maybe i'm too much of purist, but i think just a concert by the 4 of them (and a keyboardist) would have been just fine. I did not watch this a second time."
4,Quality Vanilla Chai.,"I usually buy Big Train. This is the first time I try David Rio Chai.There is equality in the quality between the two brands, but I didn't analyse the price difference."
5,Can buy it cheaper,"You can buy this item at World Market stores for $7.99.The flavor takes a little getting used to, but is a good option for chai lovers who can't have/don't want the sugar."
3,Good but not Great,"So i was browsing around amazon and came across this chain it looked nice and cheap so i ordered, but when the chain came it i was really dissapointed. The picture was very decieving because it looks like a thick chain but it is soo thin you can hardly see it from a distance. However it is a strong chain and if you keep it nice and shiny it looks good. Also i think the 24"" chain is a better fit than the 22"""
3,good for beginner,"This book has very basic beginning obedience exercises. If your dog already has basic obedience, Teamwork II is a better choice. If this is your first dog, the tricks for getting your dog to do these things are great!"
2,Useful for people with impaired mobility,"It is very breif, and lacks a lot of detail, which I would personally have found helpful. It would be useful for those with impaired mobility to find ways to achieve basic obedience skills for their dogs."
4,Very useful book - faulty cover!,The book is a comprehensive review of 6Sigma tools and 6Sigma Project management life cycle. Hard reading. Recommended if there is no fault with the book! This suppose to be a new book from amazon.com I can not send it back as this is very heavy and I need it!!
4,Six Sigma - Breyfogle,"A thorough reference book for Six Sigma and the implementation process. As a beginner, I have found it very dense. It seems to explain everything involved in Six Sigma in great detail, but it does not offer examples, so ought to be supplemented with other reference materials."
3,Sour Taste,I thought it was a very sour script that left a sour taste. McMurtry on some sort of downer. The performances were excellent and the direction was nice. There was a nice accuracy of place & delineation of character. But too much vinegar.
2,My son did not like this game at all,"I would not suggest purchasing this game. My son was disappointed that you can only play as 2 characters. We exchanged this at another vendor for Mortal Combat Armageddon which he loved. More characters, and a better game overall."
5,Best book I've read about true wealth,"This book can be read in a night but contains wisdom for a lifetime. Expecting another book about estate planning, I was pleased to find only the essential data needed to introduce the subject and the bulk of the content about thoughtfully (and prayerfully) making the six decisions about wealth transfer. This is the first book I have read by Ron Blue but I suspect it is one of his best. Intertwined between the chapters teaching us about the six decisions of wealth transfer are sole searching questions, historical examples of heros in philanthropy, and humorous cartoons introducing each chapter. But the real treasures in this book are the biblical references with reminders of the definition of stewardship in nearly every chapter - ""God owns it all"""
5,Fascinating,"This book is full of fascinating information about reading the lines, bumps, and configurations of the face. It is based on ancient Chinese tradition and will intrigue you enough to get out your mirror. Putting it into practice will require re-reading the book but you will never again look at someone's face the same way. Amazing!"
5,"The most useful, helpful practical guide to understanding.","This book answers questions about my self, my health, about others and their health with a breathtaking generosity of goodness. The goodness of everyone conveyed by the author is not to be confused with a sugar coated sweetness but an honest look at the options we have in perceptions. The gentle teachings conveyed pictorially via facial markings gives the questioning readers a bright ray of enlightenment."
4,13 fun projects to take the experienced user further,"3ds max 4 magic is full-colour, glossy and packed with 13 projects covering a variety of common tasks, individually written by professional 3D artists. There are detailed chapters on for example simulating flowing water (without expensive plugins), creating realistic underwater scenes, using the new max 4 IK, churning out textures for games, and even a bit of camera matching. And as usual, they are detailed enough to be usefull but advanced enough not to be patronising and time-wasting for the experienced reader, for whom the book is intended.The small critisism I may have centers around the lighting effects in certain chapters. They seem somewhat basic, explaining much to very little effect. In general though, the tutorials do expand on many of max 4's new features - and the accompanying CD features bonus materials and projects from those authors that got a little carried away. Good stuff!"
2,Unsatisfied,"I recently purchased this box and have been extremely disappointed. The projects are extremely interesting and detailed, if you can complete them. Out of the 6 projects I have tried, I have not been able to complete any of the them. Problems range from not getting the correct colors and textures to appear after following the steps listed to ""intuitive"" steps that are not listed that I evidently don't know. There is ""help"" available from the book's authors, if you can get a response, and they don't always know what is wrong. Overall, I have not found this to be a helpful book."
1,I just want to watch the beautiful show,Who ever produced the filming of this concert should be shot. They added cheap fade graphics & superimposed inappropriate & ugly images over ALL the concert footage. West End Girls is unforgivable. Do not buy this crap.
4,PSB Still Fresh and Relevant,"Heres' what you don't get with Pet Shop Boys ""Montage-The Nightlife Tour"": * no preening, posturing, and star tripping * no self promotion of recent album, stage play, back catalog, merchandise or website * no endless, moronic banter between songs * no tubthumbing or strident sexual politicking.Here's what you do get: * 111 minutes of soaring, melodic pop music, some of the best made in the past 20 years * innovative stage design and overlapping film imagery that enhances each of the 22 songs * engaging lyrics and charming stage persona of Neil Tennant * a ""must have"" for fans and a fine introduction to the band for anyone else with an ear for pop music. If all you know about PSB is ""West End Girls,"" their only U.S. #1 from 1986, you may be pleasantly surprised.Sound and video quality themselves are quite good. Videotape does not merit the Explicit Lyrics Advisory that it's tagged with-there's no objectionable language that I could discern."
2,Interesting Visuals - But The Sound is WOEFUL,"The visuals are interesting (when you can see them in the dark), however:* I might have a defective DVD* The mixing could be, well, rather awful* Tennant's voice might be quite weakI think I'll settle with the second point, coupled a little with the third. Maybe I'm just being harsh because most of the live shows I've seen have been by people trained in theatre/musical stage.Hmmm.I'd bump this up to four but _only_ if I could hear the vocals.D."
3,moonstone-loose stones,"This is a pretty bracelet but definitely not worth the price, shortly after buying it, one of the side stones fell out and it was by luck that I found it. It also bends too easily."
5,Fun Music,It is fun to hear music that has something to say. Love the old songsI would tell my friends to buy it.
3,Entertaining,"I actually bought the book as a X-mas gift for my father and was pleasantly surprised when after opening the book I couldn't put it down. Growing up in Millville, NJ it was interesting to look in the book and actually see the history of my hometown. The book is filled with facts about how Millville started out. It was also interesting to recognize some of the names of families that still live in town. Overall the book is filled with a colorfull history that is entertaining to read."
1,don't bother,"There is nothing in this book that is not in the MSDN documentation (comes with Visual Studio, and is freely available at the MSDN site). In some cases, this book actually tells you less than the class library reference help. E.g., the example code regarding metafiles in MSDN has more detail than this book -- and that's not a lot! The examples in the book are just way too simplistic. In places, it seems plain that the help reference has basically been copied. Every time I check this book when I'm facing a real-world problem, the book is useless. There is nothing regarding best practices. It almost seems as though the author has not done serious work with GDI. Other books in this series from Addison are ok, but not this one."
5,Perfect Reference Book,"Definitely one of the books you want in your shelf. I usually use it as a reference book. This book is full with sample code which MSDN is missing. Author also goes in the depth of many topics with interesting and fun samples.Many topics are covered in details. Full chapters on Fonts and Colors, rectangles and regions, two chapters on images tells you that author has done enough research on GDI+. In other books I usually found couple of pages on these topics.I admire the Printing chapter. Almost 100 pages chapter. WHOAaa... Every thing about pinting in .NET including customization on printing related dialogs.Great reference book. Worth spending your money. Well recommended."
3,they do some wild stuff,reno continues to produce good comedy good comedy is hard to deliver to produce it year after year is even more amazing the police of reno and the people of reno create some funny stuff.
1,Trying too hard,"I loved Motherless Brooklyn. And I thoroughly enjoyed Gun, With Occasional Music and As She Climbed Across the Table. I had high hopes for Fortress of Solitude, especially because of critics' comparisons with Kavalier & Klay.However, excruciating detail is not a substitute for plot or, more importantly, character development. Unlike Lionel Essrog (of Motherless Brooklyn) or even the ""Lack"" (of As She Climbed Across the Table), Dylan Ebdus is nothing but a sieve for long-winded overwrought descriptions of 1970s Brooklyn.Fortress of Solitude is, put simply, obsessively overwritten."
3,"Slow reading, but probably worthwhile","I found this book VERY slow going. To some extent this is because the writing is very rich--like eating fudge or chocolate cake. You can only eat a little bit at a time, even though it's delicious. I wonder how much of my reaction is that of a baby boomer white woman in the face of the much younger, multiracial cultures depicted in this book. But I had trouble making it through 25 pages a day (to meet my book club deadline) and if I didn't ""have to"" read it, I might not have finished it.I think that some of the book's problems involved insufficient editing--it might have made 2 good novellas, rather than one very long novel, and tighter editing might have made it a better book as well.Yet, I am glad I read it. I learned a lot and believe that Lethem will be one of our great American novelists if he keeps producing work."
3,Mostly great -- weak second part,"I love the first part, when the main character was a child. It was a really engaging and magical story. To me the book kind of fell flat when it moved on to the adult life of the protagonist. Ah well, I still like the book overall."
2,A Disappointment....,"Don't believe the hype. Johnathan Lethem has many strengths as a writer but they are not on full display within the pages of Fortess of Solitude. The book is a mediation on the lonliness and isolation which plaugues every one of the main characters in this book as they each deal with the changes happening within their Brooklyn neighborhood. Brooklyn is treated more like a character within these pages than the people that in habit it. If you're expecting much in the way of character development or a less than easily foreseeable plot you'll be waiting. None of the potentially interesting characters develop beyond the limits of Lethem's narrative, which is too exposition heavy. The final 200 pages jump and peter way it's way out. Instead do yourself a favor--check out Craig Clevenger's riviting 'The Contortionist's Handbook'."
5,Fantastic pillow!,"My toddler son loves this pillow. It was easy to travel with, but even at home it gives him the right support he needs at this beginning age to use a pillow. It is not flimsy so he cannot wrap it around his face. With other pillows, he usually pushes them away in the middle of the night. This one, he sleeps soundly on his back, on the pillow, all night."
3,Buckwheat pillow,"I was buing it for my son,but it's too hard and noisy for him to sleep on. I guess you have to get used to it, maybe I'll give it a try sometime. And if I'll change my opinion of it, I'll change this review then."
2,Not an exact rendition,Hearing this difficult text read added to our comprehension. I only wish the entire book was read as it is written. Some text was left out and that confused students.
5,Wow.,"I purchased this CD shortly after it was released, and let me be the first to say I could not have been more pleased with it. The opening track, ""Do What You Want"", is an upbeat, energetic song which makes dancing hard to resist. This is followed by ""Invincible"", my personal favorite on this CD, which, while a bit darker than Do What You Want, is a very good song for the fan of rock. The third and final track is a cover of The Cure's ""The Lovecats"". While I have not heard the original version of this, I must say that the boys of OK Go have done a very good job on this track. In its own right, it is a mellow and spectacular track."
3,"WORKS OK,BUT ,NO CONNECTOR ON END !!","This product works just fine,but,there is no connector on the end.You will have to butt splice the leads onto the old connector ! The sensor comes with the color code chart,for matching up yo your model vehicle."
5,Mega Gifts - Mega Helpful,"This book was almost like listening to a professional and highly experienced fund raiser give his unvarnished perspective on the motivations and realities of raising Mega Gifts. A nice peak into the human nature of those fortunate enough to be in a position to make large gifts to worthy and perhaps not so worthy causes. I found the book to be very helpful being new to the field of fund raising, though experienced in dealing with powerful and wealthy people in other professional settings. Not a ""How To"" book in the strictest sense, but more a what is and what motivates type of book. Worth the read."
1,Don't use this book alone,"I studied this book from beginning to end. There are more than some typos and mistakes even on the answers. I took the exam today, none of the questions were on the test. The material covered in this book is about 60% of what is on the actual exam. Don't use this as your only source."
4,"A Pretty Good Travel Guide, Perhaps Too Condensed.","This is a pretty good travel guide. It might have been a little too condensed. I liked the slim form factor of the book. I personally would have preferred if it was a little bit larger and went into greater detail on some of the topics.As opposed to the more complete Lonely Planet Beijing book, this book was published earlier this year. I would like to think that some of the information is more up to date as a result. It's simply too difficult to compare due to the fact that the book doesn't cover as many topics.On the upside, like most Lonely Planet books, the graphics and pictures are awesome. I would have preferred a little more detail on the site map, but in general Lonely Planet does a nice job with their visuals.On a whole, I would recommend this book to somebody who will soon be travelling to Beijing."
1,ID clip,ID clip keeps falling off and my ID tag separates from the latch. Not a great product. Look elsewhere. Waste of money
1,Piece of Junk,"I had this reel for about a month. During that time, the string in the reel wheel would always jam. After about a month, it jammed up so badly that it no longer reeled back into the wheel. When I tried to fix it, the string just straight up broke. I will never buy this product again. You better off getting a cheaper wheel from your local hardware store or section. I went to Walmart and got one with a chain, instead of string, and it cost $4 instead of the $6 or so this piece of junk cost from this seller."
2,"Ok at first, but failed after 30 days","When I first started using it, it was quite nice and worked well. After 30 or so days of use holding nothing but a couple of ID cards it suddenly failed to retract anymore. Nothing I could do would fix it, ended up having to throw it away."
5,Does what it says on the tin.,"Larger than I expected, but I got used to that pretty quick. Sturdy and reliable so far. Does what it says on the tin."
5,Waspinator,"I was skepticle of the Waspinator, but it has virtually eliminated wasps from my front porch and my back patio. Great idea; great product!"
1,Dissolved after just a few rainy days...,"I've ordered this exact item twice from the exact same seller.The first set I ordered in 2009 and those are still in excellent shape and are still holding up. For those, I would give 5 stars.The second set I ordered in 2011 and those disintegrated within just a few rainy days. Since it is obvious to me that the material used has been changed at some point between those orders, I unfortunately have to give them 1 star.If the material goes back to what they were originally, I would order again and give 5 stars at that point."
5,Works great for cold process soap...or in recipes!,"I bought this grapeseed oil for making soap. The price is right and it works great! My soap comes out just the way I expect it to every time. Highly recommended to those interested in making cold process soaps with lye.I have also started using it as a replacement for ""vegetable oil"" in recipes. I don't feel comfortable using actual vegetable oil (which is usually soybean oil), and I usually substitute with olive oil...but sometimes I don't want things to taste like olive! This grapeseed oil has a very light flavor that does not affect the taste of recipes. I also feel good about the high smoke point; this makes it an ideal oil for use in cooking and baking."
5,Electric Prunes at their Best,"If you liked I had too much to dream, I would highly recommend this album. The songs have beautiful harp-like sounds and excellent vocals. This is a must have for anyone who collects 60s music."
4,Best Value,"At fifteen bucks, this is the force feedback accessory you want. It isn't subtle, but if I didn't want feedback I would have put the money towards Jet Grind Radio instead of buying this. The vibration is strong but not distracting and is very effective in light guns.The fit is good, but not perfect, and the pack does rattle more than Sega's That costs the InterAct pack a star in my book. Of course, I just do the same as when something rattles in my car-- turn up the volume and the problem's solved. Some people may find it annoying though."
5,Which Jumpack to buy?,"I was a little scared about buying a rumble pack that was so cheap at first. I already had a giant subwoofer and I didnt think that I could get much more. So I decided to spend a little on the Temor I bought 2 for the price of the Sega model. I was able to rent the Sega model and it was not ""rumbling"" very much so I was hesitant to spend $60 on the Sega Models. I bought the tremors and I was simply amazed. The quality is excellent."
1,did not work,looks great but does not work! i should have known better from the crappy reviews. this is going back asap!
1,Nice not sheer,"Nice quality satin, not sheer as they appear. Kept them because the quality was good and fit my 15 y/o daughter well. Used for a XV party outfit."
3,Average,"I read this book in no more than two days. Yes, i enjpyed this book but I felt no desperate need for it to continue. Normally when I read a really good book I long to read more even if it has finished at the right place. This was my first dark-hunter book. I read a previous review that said you could not read this one first. Actually i found it relatively easy to get into the plot and understand what was happening. A quarter of the way through the book i did have to go to the back and read ""the beginning""- a short story of how dark hunters came about. It was really useful to read this because it explains a lot. I liked the plot a lot but i found the romance lacking. For me it was all too predictable- sometimes i like the predictable but I didn't really feel a conection with the main characters. This is an average read and i didnt really feel for the characters."
3,I was disappointed...,"I am a huge fan of the Dark Hunter books, but Alexion and Danger's story was a disappointment. Totally cardboard characters! The only point to reading the book is to add to the information we know about the DH world, since it provides some information that lays groundwork for future stores. I really think that Kenyon is spreading herself too thin by writing several other series along with the DH (both as Sherrilyn Kenyon and Kinley McGregor). I didn't really think the Valerius and Tabitha romance worked in the last book in this series, but at least those characters were acceptably fleshed out. I hope the series gets back on track with the next story."
3,cute,"This is my first Dark Hunter novel. It was cute. Read it quickly, enjoyable twists and (slight) turns. Liked: the Alexion and Ash and the other dimensions alluded to. Did not enjoy the overdose of ""hip"" talk, but I guess the young folk like that sort of thing. Did not like the ending, that Disney-esque happily ever after stuff. The whole thing was a bit on the ""fluffy"" side. Not sure if I will read another..."
3,Borrow It,"Kenyon is a real ""hit and miss"" author. I have decided her books fall into 3 categories - ""Buy,"" ""Borrow"" and ""Don't Bother."" This falls between ""don't bother"" and ""borrow it."" The story shares nothing new about Ash and is not related to any of the other dark hunters so can easily be skipped with no impact to the series. While I felt sympathy for and interest in Alexion's character, Danger was rather flat and uninteresting."
4,"Not the best in the series, but still enjoyed.","I had taken a little break from the Dark Hunter series, but got right back into it with this installment. I read it quick and enjoyed it like all the others, but the characters in this book didn't capture my attention as much as the others. It was a nice way to advance the whole storyline and learn more about Ash. I loved Simi and her sister, they brought lots of smiles to my face. I missed the other characters like Julian and Kyrian in this installment.Since I read the kindle version, I did not see the short story, ""the beginning"" and I feel very disappointed that I missed this story. :("
3,NOT as good as the others,"I did not care about anyone in this story. This book is not in the same caliber as her other DH books and to me was not important to the series. It was this book and book # 9 that made me stop buying her series - two not even good read in a row is all I give an author. Maybe if they would quit turning out so many books a year the story/style would still be the same.Your over doing it SK with the DH, Dream series and the one under Kinley MacGregor."
5,I LOVED IT!!!!,I am really into these fairy tale type of things. I picked this up off the shelf off the library expecting it to be like a fairy tale. I was wrong. It is so ful of adventure! I finished it in ONE DAY! No kidding! I could not put it down! I highly recomend it to any one with a good appetite for books!
2,Couldn't get it to work....lost 2 days on this,"I'm surprised why this would not work. It seemed to get my desktop settings right. But the most important thing: my data it didn't get right!:(The file and byte count didn't match(not even close) between the source and target XP systems. It also copied a secondary backup drive on the source computer even though I didn't specify it. Another shock: it didn't get the byte or file count right on the secondary drive on the source computer either!But not getting the byte and file count for my crucial data directories just shocked me...I'm now going to just do a manual move I think.I've to reimage my target pc again(because i'm not sure what this program did!), and then just do the move manually.I can't believe XP does not have something like this built-in, that users have to try programs that don't work."
1,Roman Catholic Theology vs. The Bible,"It saddens me to see a former Bible-believing Christian succumb to the seducing spirit that is Roman Catholicism. You will not find apostolic succession, papal infallability, purgatory, indulgences, Marian dogmas, or salvation through works in the Bible. In John 17:11, Jesus Christ refers to our Father in Heaven as Holy Father. Now Mr. Ray refers to the Catholic pope as Holy Father. How sad. How very, very sad."
3,"Excellent basic book, lacking in-depth analysis","An excellent book for beginners, but lacking an in-depth analysis of why term sheet are built in a certain way. Most of the content is boilerplate and useful for somebody that has never seen a deal term sheet. The comparative approach on content is good. For the price, it is a good shelf acquisition, though."
5,"Must Have Book For Every VC, Entrepreneur & Financial Exec","I was very impressed with this book, as it provides an ACTUAL term sheet with line by line wording for entrepreneur favorable, investor favorable and neutral. It also goes into detail on valuations, comparables and other important issues that affect every term sheet. By far the best VC type book I have read so far-this book is a must have on the bookshelves of every financial professional, executive, vc or entrepreneur."
4,A Sensible Approach,"As a 39 year old single Wharton Business School graduate, I was thrilled to read this book. Greenwald adopts basic marketing techniques and teaches the reader to market herself effectively. It is a take control program, completely empowering for a single woman. Finally someone has stepped beyond the typical pop-psychology books and given women a sensible and methodical means to finding a partner. I am on the Program!"
3,Finding love does not require a college degree,"This book has some good ideas but I became lost in the idea that you can use mechanical means to make love happen between a man and woman. If you read it with the intent to take some of the ideas and use them and discarrd those that sound a bit far fetched then you will still come out ahead. A book I like better than this one was ""How to Date Your Wife"" by Stan Cronin. Take his ideas and apply them to your huband hunting and I think you will get better results. Though ""How to Date Your Wife"" is aimed at husbands, any single person or wife can use the ideas to latch onto their dream spouse or become a dream spouse. Love cannot be found by going through checklists and using mechanical means."
1,Pay attention to which iPod,"This product didn't work with either of the iPods in our home. Further, finding out which iPod it works with and doesn't work with is confusing. I finally found an Apple site that describes how to determine the version of an iPod.Amazon made it very easy to return but, it's still a hassle and it would have been easier to determine the iPod version first."
5,Griffin iTalk,It was in great condition and I got it really soon after i ordered it. It works really well!
3,"High compatibility, low quality",The iTalk Pro works seamlessly with my 5th generation ipod. It doesn't use a lot of power. It records in WAV format so the file size is about 450mb for an hour of recording. Its easy to transfer recordings to iTunes. The only downside is that there is no recording level adjustment so it peaks out when you try to record music. It works great for just voice recordings.
4,Cheap and easy way to turn my iPod Touch into a VOIP Phone,"Using my 32GB iPod Touch running the 2.2.1 firmware and the free Fring App I have turned my MP3 player into a SIP(VOIPStunt/Skype phone and with a phone number from IPkall.com as long as I'm connected to wifi I can make FREE SIP call anywhere in the USA and recieve incoming calls also. At first, I was using the headphones with the builtin microphone but the iTalk along with the iPods speakers allow me to hold and use like a phone to hold a conversation. Until the 3.0 firmware upgrade allows me to use bluetooth with the itouch is the best you can find for the price."
1,shoddy,"I bought this to record meetings of 25 people. Plug it in, simple, easy to work. Picks up the whole room. But it always picks up the sound of the drive writing and when the auto gain boosts on lower voices that clicking overwhelms the signal. I thought it would be great once I plugged a mic & amp into it, but I could never get the mic input to work. After plugging it in a few times, the whole device fell apart, literally (and I was not at all rough with it). I bought the Belkin, 2x the cost but works like a charm - even better than plugging the mic & amp directly into my Powerbook (the Belkin seems to add a little boost & is less noisy). The Belkin can also charge as you record, which the Griffin can't. Seems an iPod can't record much more than 75 minutes before it runs out of power, so the ability to charge while recording can be crucial."
1,it's alright,"bottom line... it works, BUT it'll drain the battery in no time at all, so make sure you battery is charged before you use it because you can't charge it while you are recording. I have also noticed that upon playback there are skips or jumps in the recording. Which kinda sucks if you're recording vital info. You end up getting the point, but you miss a couple of seconds here and there. It's also really quiet on the playback, I had to put it on my home computer and blast the speakers until I could hear it. Wait until it's on sale or until they release something better."
3,Blocks headphone output of Nano 2G,"My wife uses it to record short snippets of herself, so that she listen to and correct her pronunciation of some particular words in a foreign language. She is happy with the recording quality, but it blocks the headphone output of iPod Nano 2G (the tall ones with metallic colors, but cannot play video.) I don't know if the full size iPods have their headphone outputs on the top, so it may work better for those, but my wife has to disconnect iTalk before she can listen. Repeating this step after each word recording makes it quite impractical for this purpose. Otherwise it works as promised; the recordings gets transferred to our iTunes automatically."
4,Nice Product,Wish it had a built in speaker. Other than that the audio quality it great! I have been using it in my guitar class to record the practice sessions. Sounds Unbelievable.
4,Sole problem is no way to lock it off,"Considering the size, cost and convenience, the audio quality is excellent. I've carried it around for interviews for podcasts and they are fine.The iPod scroll wheel can control the recording unit, so a separate start/stop button is not required on the iTalk. Unfortunately it's there, though, and the iPod lock switch does NOT override it. So you cannot keep it assembled and at the ready because it's forever turning itself on and draining the battery, recording hours of unwanted background noise. It's like having a camera that you have to take the film out of after every shot.If the iPod software can be upgraded so the lock switch locks out this button, the utility of the device would be greatly improved."
1,Avoid.,"I was extremely disappointed in this device. The line-through is useless recording completely inaudible mush. The actual mic itself records with incredible amounts of noise, distortion and volume fluctuations. I found the iTalk a complete waste of money."
4,First episode with the Klingons,"This is the first episode that introduces us to the Klingon Empire. All-out war almost breaks out when some unlikely beings interfere.John Colicos' Commander Kor is marvelous and sets the tone for suceeding actors who portray Klingons.This is the origin of the Organian Peace Treaty, referred to in subsequent episodes. This also sets the foundation of the eventual peace between the Federation and the Klingon Empire, which we saw in Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine."
1,HP 98A Cartridge - BEWARE,This was my first bad purchase on Amazon. I'm by no means blaming Amazon. The cartridge leaked toner and streaked every page printed. I will probably never buy refilled toner cartridges again from anywhere.
4,good little hairdryer,"Pros: quiet, small and portable, cute, works well.Cons: needs a setting that blows just air and not heat."
5,Jerdon 1600w hair dryer,"I first tried this hair dryer on vacation and thought it was great because it was small and delivered the power I needed. Now, I don't have to hold heavy blow dryers twice the size to do my hair. I love it."
4,Good all-purpose chairs,"We have two of these chairs in a pediatric office and they are great. Not only do they stand up to constant, daily use, lots of people mention that they are very comfortable. They were not difficult to put together and are quite sturdy."
5,About this Author,"We have a new P.G. Wodehouse, maybe even better, we will see. One of the best pieces of fiction I have read in a long time. what a find, this Author deserves all the great reviews he is getting.All the wonderful twists in this great story will have you either smiling or laughing out loud."
2,Disappointing,"Cal Cunningham works in a bookstore in Manhattan and dreams of being a successful novelist. He discovers his roommate's manuscript and is stunned at how great it is, and when his roommate is killed in a traffic collision, Cal passes the book off as his own and is soon the hottest commodity in publishing. He marries and tries to settle into being the successful novelist he's supposed to be. His own guilt and a young woman named Lesley from his past begin to unravel the scheme. Lesley not only blackmails Cal, but she also seduces his wife. Cal is soon thinking of murder, but can he possibly pull that off too? The book is supposed to be satirical and suspenseful, but it comes off as pretentious and fatuous. None of the characters are worth knowing, and the ludicrous ending stretches this farce too far."
3,Recommended Reading for Those in Need of Brain Candy...,"John Colapinto's ""About the Author"" is a well-paced, well-written farsical tale. Its highly improbable plot and exaggerated characters are lots of fun, but I think it is a stretch to call this dark or clever. The author does a great job poking fun at the literati and his nods to pop culture are right on the mark. This is a book that does not require a lot from its reader. It is quick, fun, and wildly entertaining -- a perfect vacation read!"
2,not natural at all,"they don't show you the ingredients for this product & now I know why: it contains the same nasty ""petrolatum"" (petroleum product) that most other hairball remedies also containI wanted something better than that & have not gotten it in this productmy cat doesn't care for it to boot (can't blame her)I have been looking for products to help her digestion - this is not it - makes her throw up :PWON'T buy again!"
5,Great stuff!,"Grass Gel is the only brand of hairball remedy that both my cats enjoy. It says it's malt flavored (you'd have to ask Blue or Bear about that). Usually, one is picky and turns up his nose at anything but cat food, but even he loves the taste of Grass Gel. Both cats have lovely shiny coats, too, an additional benefit. Most important, it reduces hairballs a lot. Will keep buying this!"
3,There isn't any kind of information about how to use it,This tape is divided into three segments but there isn't any kind of guidelines of how we are supposed to use it and how many times a week. Because it's not a normal weight workout it should give that kind of information.
5,Tiger,"Very rapid delivery, a few days. Easy to apply. Works great. First time I tried this formulation. Usually bought the gel. This is much easier to apply."
5,Life Changing,"This book touched me deeply. I have a renewed desire to live closer to Christ and to God because of this book.I respect the author for his willingness to share his own weaknesses and what he needed to learn. It takes a lot of courage to bare one's soul and he did it so others could learn from his experiences. I, for one, learned and I thank him for that.Read this book with an open heart to what is taught. If you do so, you won't be disappointed."
1,Not a great cookbook,"I saw this book at my local library and decided to borrow it. I looked through the cookbook to see what Mama Dip had to offer, well, I was very disappointed in the recipes for this cookbook. I want to learn as much as I can about Southern cooking, but the recipes in this cookbook are so basic and uninspiring that I would be ashamed to serve them to my family. I expected better from a woman from North Carolina, but I guess I was wrong. Such a shame, too, because I've read good things about her cookbooks. Either she's not giving her best recipes, or she must not be that great a cook. I returned this book to the library the same day that I borrowed it because it was downright terrible."
4,Prenatal use?,"In anticipation of our upcoming baby, I took the tube out of the box and noted for the first time that the instructions also recommend its application in the third trimester; as a preconditioner. A customer testimonial included in the packaging indicated that having started the treatment *before* the arrival of her 3rd child made her last breastfeeding experience pain/crack free. Just thought I'd mention this since I haven't seen it discussed in any of the other reviews. I'll let y'all know how it goes! This will be our first baby. Btw, it is slimier than vaseline!"
4,Useful,"I used this with nursing two children and I only had luck when I discovered the plastic nipple shields with my second child. Without the shields I couldn't keep my nipples dry long enough to make the difference.It really has made a huge difference and got me past that initial OUCH. I've discovered its got multiple uses besides just for nipples, you can use it for just about any severely dry skin and it will help.It has a smell, I'm really not a huge fan of the stink but its well worth it."
4,What is it with orphaned boys?,"I don't know why, but orphaned boys get under my skin. I always want to take care of them, all the while I'm admiring their independence. Jack is no different. He's exciting to be around, wild at heart, and just now realizing that his upbringing, while giving him major skills for a life of crime, has left him a bit short in the morals department.Enter Draycos, a highly-sensitive, highly-evolved, very moral creature with the wisdom of ages of culture and a desperate need for help. He's a great foil for Jack, a loyal friend and a noble warrior all in one. They work well together--very well.For me, it's all about the characters and how they impact each other on this long journey they're taking to save Draycos' people from extinction. The books only get more exciting from here.Good series, good read."
5,Awesome All Around!,Excellent service! The set came as described and very quickly. The set is one of the most helpful retreats I've heard. I've already listened to it several times! Well worth the money.
4,No Frills Advice,"I opened Furnishing Forward to the author's advice on dealing with ""emotional-attachment"" issues between married couples. It might have fended off some nasty arguments if both my wife and I had read it before we crossed swords over a matter as small as which constitutes the ideal trash can. ""If compromise can get us out of the Cuban Missile Crisis,"" writes Bridges, ""surely it can get us out of decorating disagreements."" There's solid, ever so practical advice like that throughout this truly helpful book."
5,Great concept!,"The Torch throwbot was my first. My favorite part of them is standing them on their carrying cases and battling with a sibling. Our rules are: 1. Hit the throwbot owner with disc. 2. Hit opposing throwbot with disc. 3. If disc slips, you make take ONE retry. These rules proved to be a big help!"
5,I lent it out and never got it back.,"Just what I wanted. It's got a lot of pages and was worth the money. For some reason, instead of receiving 1, I got 2 as I thought I had cancelled the first one. It showed ebooks which I didn't want and hoped that I had actually cancelled it. The book is great."
4,Take one part Monopoly and one part Magic the Gathering and all parts awesome.,"Culdcept Saga is a weird idea but done right. Tons of cards, long Single-player campaign with helpful tutorials to suck you in, and endless amounts of online battles with friends and random people Via Xbox live. Not the game for everyone, but if you like Magic the Gathering, Yugioh, or other card battle games as well as some strategy, you own it to yourself to buy this hidden gem.Worth every penny."
3,Just ok,"Ok set, price ok, not great. Didnt realize this set was not the one that had the indentions in the blade so what you are slicing doesnt stick to blade. Can't remember what that is called, they are sharp but I have concerns about edges after sharpening. They are attractive tho on my counter.:-)"
5,All the difference:),Only thing I regret about this pump is that I've waited so long to buy it. As many other Moms I went thru some manual and cheap electric pumps just to realize that if I really want to be successful with breastfeeding for long time I have to spend some money. I love this pump and personaly recomend it to all nursing moms. It may seem expensive but if you think how much money are you saving on formula each month it's really not that bad and very much worth it!!!
2,Thanks for the reviews,Thank you for the reviews. I was just upgrading from QB 2001 PRO to 2003 Pro and had some concern regarding the new version. My bookkeeper wants me to move to Peachtree after a bad year of working with TurboTax and QuickBooks together..thanks for the advice. I shall return my QB 2003 Pro purchase and find another product.
1,Quickbooks Requires Gator Spyware to Run,"I have verified that Quickbooks pro now REQUIRES the Gator SPYWARE to run. They don't tell you this, but it silently installs Gator, a long known spyware program, and if you uninstall the spyware with ad-aware or manually remove the spyware Quickbooks tells you that you are trying to open a document created with a newer version than your software. When you go to the automatic update online, it REINSTALLS Gator spyware. BEWARE. My intrusion detection system showed the PC with Quickbooks/Gator sending ten times the amount of information back to Gator than the pc's infected with the regular version of the Gator spyware. Spyware advice sites report that Gator sends the information you fill into forms back to them. Now imagine filling in a credit card number on a web form...BE AFRAID. BE VERY AFRAID."
3,Wobbles but works,"Well, the title really says it all. It is a bit wobbly, but works just fine. I like it, and the wobbling forces me to keep a healthy balanced stance while using it."
5,"""He knows, Doctor, he knows...""","This is simply the best TOS episode ever. It is really a thing of beauty. Of course, get the book by Harlan Ellison, which is also genius, but if you choose to see one episode, make this it. I am a die-hard Trekker, but even novices choose this episode, because it has the best science fiction plot in near ANY of ANY Trek episodes. Live long and Prosper."
1,The picture of this book is not matched with the tile.,"Is the picture of this book miss placed with John Scofields Jazz Funk book? And the one of Scofield's Jazz Funk is miss placed with ""Guitar lessons with the greats""?!"
4,"Great boat, but not a 5 person boat","Bought this for my wife, two kids and myself. It takes 5 or so minutes to pump up (hand pump)and 2 or 3 minutes to take down. It seem to be a solid and sturdy boat. Quality is above average. I use a 30 lb. thrust electric and it moves it well. It comes with a carry bag to take it from/to the lake and works pretty well. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it only handles 2-3 people comfortably. I have hadme, my wife and 2 kids all in at the same time and all works well, just not quite enough room. I would say 3 people max for comfort. It is an awesome boat overall."
1,PS2 INTEC WIRELESS CONTROLLER_PROBLEMS!@!,"Received the controller as a gift....after charging the remote 12 hours!!! I was able to play Lord of The Rings for approximately 4 hours, before it lost power....Charged overnight...was able to play a baseball game approximately 2 hours before it ran out of juice!!!!This item will take more time to write a review, drive to the post office and return it than MY ACTUAL GAME TIME, as well as, I will still have to find a new wireless remote...If you spend less than two hours playing a game in a day, great...if not look eleswhere...When the remote works...it works perfectly, however the lack of playable time makes this remote virtually worthless!!!!"
5,No-mor Flats Tube,"A great product. It makes my bicycling life so much easier. This was my second tire to replace, so I know it works great. Car tires really need to adopt this sooner."
4,A silence that speaks,"This collection of silent films adapted from Shakespeare's plays is really funny and interesting. It is even amusing to see how the genius of words and shouts and all other vocal expressions is translated in pure silence thanks to gestures, postures, costumes, settings, and a few pages summarizing the successive scenes. We probably miss the words, but we do have the feelings and the atmospheres of the plays. It is important to watch these short films to really know how fascinating and universally known Shakespeare is. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX."
3,coming undone?- wrap this up with more stuff,"Hey,I am all about the delicious collaborations of record execs sitting around trying to decide what to put in a collection.The next eclectic group should comprise of old school durans-all the b-sides, simon's solo work and other band member's forays into movie soundtracks.I was a little unimpressed with this. What about a collection that appeals to fans who already own all the works? This is a great collection for the import purchaser only- keep it on a shelf, but wait for a better collection to play-something with the funk we all know and love."
4,Mid-size Plates,"These plates are bright and attractive, and reasonably priced. My only reservation about them is a reaction to the cautions in the accompanying directions, which imply that they are more fragile than many such plates, being subject to damage from quick changes of temperature."
4,ITS NOT HARD TRANCE,"Well, dudes surprising most of you all, Mauro Picotto DOES NOT spin OR produce HARD TRANCE. Mauro Picotto spins OR produces TECH-TRACNE or, TECHNO-TRANCE as you wish, which is a gap between techno and trance and even some house influences tend to appear in his songs.He's very good indeed and this cd for sure rocks. Its very good, has excelent tracks - alltough MP gets too much melodic sometimes... but yes, its worth buying, and its worth having it in a decent techno/trance/eletronic music collection.Positive vibes... to all of you out there!"
2,many songs are filler tracks,Roughly half of the CD are either instrumental tracks or sung by someone else. I doubt most people realize this before they buy.
1,cheap plastic,These push-up bars are cheap plastic. They flex when you put all of your weight on them. Don't waste your money....buy a good metal pair.
5,TKO Extreme Training Push -up Bars,Pros: Works as advertised. Inexpensive.Cons: Could use a slightly larger grip and more padding. Floor grippers could be a bit more sticky to avoid slipping.Overall Assessment: I'd buy them again
5,"Cheap, lightweight, strong, and portable.","It's cheap, lightweight plastic, strong, and portable. I've been using them so far for a month, and the grips have stayed in place. I can do more push-ups with little to no pain in my wrist... a huge improvement. If you're looking for cheap push-up stands that work, this fits the bill."
4,Good Product,"For the small price these push-up bars are great. I'm a 200 pound man and I feel confident that they will support my weight when I'm using them. The only negative about these bars is that the handles could use a little more cushioning but once again, for the price they are exactly what I expected."
3,Does the job,"Far more efficient than regular pushups; gives you a deeper shoulder workout, better flexibility and joint control after you master the technique. I'd also recommendPerfect Pullup Heavy Duty Performance Series Ab Strapsfor workouts around the house."
3,Could be better,"I was a little surprised to discover that they are plastic and assemble like Leggos. They are stable enough for me (180 lbs) but I could see them failing for a big person.Since they are just molded plastic, I would like to have a wider palm rest to distribute the pressure. The thin foam grip helps a bit.I don't think the manufacturer put much effort into this product, but they work and I'm using them."
4,They performed as I expected them to,These handles serve the very purpose I bought them for. The are comfortable and lightweight. I don't disassemble them but they still fit together and take up very little space. I am not heavy so I can't comment on the strength but my wrists are much more comfortable and I can do a full range push-up without touching the ground which is why I bought them.
4,Speaks Too Explicitly,"I have thoroughly enjoyed most of McCammon's books, especially Boys Life and Gone South, third choice is Wolf's Hour. This one I'd rate fourth in line. Too much ..., I found myself skipping pages to avoid undesirable mental images."
3,descent low level bike,"The bike is a good starter first bike for your child. The only issues I had were the rims being bent due to loose spokes. I had to take to a bike shop to have the spokes tightened. For the price it is a good bike. But if you are looking for a better quality, this is not the one for you. Overall my 10 y.o. son still likes the bike."
2,Unclear and not helpful,"This book is not at all helpful, it is hard to follow, and problems are hard to understand without diagrams. Sometimes you're stuck on one paragraph for an hour, because you're unable to see how the author got some equation, and he isn't the least bit interested in giving readers a hint. There are also a couple of bad mistakes in problem sections, asking students to prove incorrect statements, or omitting assumptions that should've been stated. This book will confuse you more than it'll help you."
5,XUXA 10 anos,"Very very good. I used to watch ""El Show de Xuxa"" in spanish. Love the CD and our little song too."
3,One of the Only Options...,"There are similar atlases to this one available for the US and they are great tools for travelling and finding out-of-the-way spots. This one however lacks the detail that would allow it to be similarly useful. Unfortunately, you could get a map from AAA that would be as useful and for much less..."
4,Very Good Album,Bradley Powell creates another Acoustic Relaxing Guitar based album with natural sounds that are a Pure reflection of Atmosphere&very comforting.very pure tradtional sounds&very re-freshing to the Ears. a Nice collection of Songs.
5,"""coffee table"" book for the mind","This is a ""coffee table"" book of ideas to spend a few minutes with at a time rather than a book to sit and read from cover to cover. As a kid I used to read through the World Book Encyclopedia; this book provides the same kind a service and sometimes excitement for selected important ideas that have ""changed the world"".Brief, concise, pointed sketches of important ideas are on target for their selection and coverage. Perhaps far from perfect, but there is nothing else nearly as good. Selected notes direct one to books to purse any idea further. Many ideas will be familiar and the short essays and photos may stimulate memories or reflection. A few will be new - or commonly misunderstood. Either way the open minded reader will learn something and be stimulated. Except for the tired cynic, most will find some intellectual entertainment and perhaps even stimulus to deeper thought."
3,Perfect for the toilet,"This book is perfect toilet-reading, if you're so inclined. One idea is presented on two pages, which makes it a quick read. The book is in no way an essential reading, so I cannot give the book more than three stars. Still, it is a good book in the toilet-reading category."
1,"Each song on ""Wish It Would Rain"" is edited!","This import series of Temptations 2-fers is notorious for editing the tracks to make two albums fit on one CD. In this case, they have been a little trickier, and the edits are not so obvious, but to me it matters! What they have done is to fade each track from ""Wish It Would Rain"" 5 seconds early, which shaves 60 seconds off the album. Ridiculous!I didn't bother to evaluate ""In a Mellow Mood,"" since it is available as a domestic CD.Why are so many of the great Temptations' albums out of print? They are the most popular, most famous group of their type, and yet there have been huge holes in their catalog for many, many years now. I bought this series of import CDs to help correct that, and I have been bitterly disappointed, due to the shameless editing of the albums."
3,Good watch but some issues...,"I gave this watch as a gift to my dad for Christmas in '07. The watch itself is really nice and a good value, but there was a problem with keeping time. The knob to set the time sometimes comes out which stops the time. It's happened quite a few times. Other than that no complaint."
5,"For a glimpse of what a real human being can be, read this!","The Monk of Mt Athos is a small volume written by a remarkable Russian Orthodox monk about his experiences of a genuine modern saint who died in the late 1930's. For a savor of authentic Eastern Orthodox Christian spirituality this book is a real gem. Sophrony is himself something of a saint and he writes with clarity of the man he intimately knew on Mount Athos for nearly ten years. It offers a glimpse of the power of God's Grace working in the heart through constant remembrance of the name of Jesus and interior spiritual warfare. Fr. Silouan is a living modern example of real Christianity. He is an example of what true purity of heart and wakeful attention make possible in a human being. Very highly recommended. It is one of a very few books that are genuine, accesible to the reader and yet far enough beyond that they continue yielding fruit after many attentive readings."
5,rival slow cooker,"Great addition to the kitchen , I have a larger one as well. Cleans up easily. Miss the 4/6hr timer that the larger model has, but still great product."
3,I have a question??,I just received my Rival 3735WN slow cooker in the mail from Amazon.com. The glass lid has a manufacturer's hole in it - why would it have a hole in it? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of a crockpot? Does anyone else's have a hole in the lid? Other crockpots I've seen don't have holes in their lids. Is this a new thing? Thanks for your comments.
5,The Inexpensive Alternative to Gold Leaf!,"I have used this product multiple times. In fact, I purchased four tubs of the gold and silver luster dust (2 each) five years ago and I am JUST NOW running out! I use this stuff to gild all sorts of things for Renaissance themed banquets - including gilding an entire roast duck and then, using vodka, painting filigree designs onto it! The clients thought it was prop food it looked so beautiful. I can't recommend this stuff enough!"
2,Replacement Sony Battery,Didn't last long. We bought them before and they were good but not the last ones we bought.
3,perfect glass cover,top was very well made but didnt fit right had to sand off 1/4 of an inch to get it to fit
3,sunglasses,"Delivery was fast and product is like picture. A part broke off after a week. But they are pretty cheap, so i didn't expect more.Nice looking."
2,Suprisingly small,"We just received the silver polishing cloth. It arrived promptly from the vendor. I was shocked, however, when we opened the mailing box and found a cloth not much bigger than a postage stamp. Also, no instructions came with the product, so we don't know if we can wash the cloth or not, to remove the dirt the cloth picked up. (It did clean our silver jewelery very well.)Would I recommend it? Probably, but I sure wish that a) It was a little bigger so that it was easier to handle, and b) there were product care instructions."
1,terrible product,"I (Gina, Dave's wife) purchased this back in June 2010 and finally got around to using it at the end of last year (threw my old cloth away). It cleans silver jewelry veryy well. However, after wearing the earrings that I cleaned with this cloth, my ear holes had a gray tarnish stain on them - consistently! At first I thought it was the earring, but after this happened with every earring that I cleaned, I figured out it was the cloth. This had never happened with previous cloths I had used. I tried to return this but obviously the return policy does not allow me to since too much time has passed. So, I thought I'd post this review to let you all know not to buy this cloth."
4,"Western, history, love story","This is a good book to get you craving more western love story's. I could not put it down. Enjoyed it very much. Now I have added her next two. ""Fireblossom"" & ""Wildblossom"" loved them all. looking for more to come!"
3,"Great burp cloth, but...","These work great as burp cloths, but not actual diapers. The fit won't be snug and the diaper not absorbant enough. I hear some of the more expensive specialty diapers work better if you want to try cloth diapers. I gave up and went with disposable."
2,Very poor DVD quality transfer from original,"Despite their best efforts, this was one of the worst DVD transfers I've ever seen. There are lines running throughout the entire film and it gets very bad in some spots. The audio also rises and falls in volume unexpectedly. And the DVD jammed up and would not play through to the end (it stopped around a minute and a half before the end).As for the film/story itself...I found it to be boring as all get out, and anything but erotic. The acting was wooden. And the music was annoying. 1 hour and 34 minutes, but it seemed like an Eternity. If this is one of Sarno's best, I'd hate to see his worst.(Oh...and the wigs were absolutely hideous -- 70's or no 70's. They were so ugly they were distracting.)"
5,EXCELLENTE!,Wow..first off let me tell you how I recieved this cd. This kid gave one of my friends this cd. And she didnt know who they were so she offered it to my other friend and she didnt want it. So I took a look at it and said id like to check it out. As soon as I got home and heard the first bit of it..I blasted it up and sat in my bed and put the cd on repeat. (Though my parents didnt enjoy the loudness). The lyrics in the songs just move me. and explain a bunch of things that happen. I dont know what it is but how the emo lyrics and the music just mix and I feel they did a really good job in this cd! I now want to go see them now while their on tour and I am hoping they make another cd!
5,Love it!,"I really like this video. I recently got back into step and needed some additional videos. I need the higher impact and look for longer (rather than shorter) routines. This video fits the bill perfectly. I like that you can increase the difficulty to your own preference for each mini set, and within the set. I also like that Gin Miller's body type is like mine (athletic) so I can relate to having a fit body like hers. I do like her personality (not too bubbly or false) and her cues are perfect. I have done the video twice now, and it will definitely be in my rotation."
3,text,"This book was purchased for my daughter for school. Other than the fact that she passed the course, I really cannot review this book!"
3,Better solution for tall roofs?,"Two story houses with high roofs are a tough reach. I need about 30 feet of pole to reach the peaks, so this product (while clearly very useful) unfortunately won't work for me. Any suggestions?"
2,does not work but did not increase my hair fall either,I have tried so many products to stop my hair fall. I have had 3 hair plantation sessions too. I care so much for my hair that I spent a lot on it. This product is a part of my trails and it does not help. I used it as suggested for more than 2 months and I do not see any thing working. At least it did not increase my hair fall like Nisim.I would not recommend this product if you are looking to stop hair loss.I am using nioxin 2 system and Nioxin is better.
5,A book that does justice to this great little plane,"The book covers the major part of this plane's service life, starting at its inception and ending at the fall of the USSR. Retelling its birth as a prototype, its service in Afghanistan and subsequent design changes, and its ongoing service in several airforces. All illustrated with lots of B&W photographs, line-drawings that illuminate speficic details and more than ten colour paintings (the frontpage features a truly outstanding painting of a hapless Iraqi pilot pursued by F-15's)."
2,Actually Crashed My Computer,"I was very excited about playing this game, but when after I installed it, my computer crashed every time I tried to run it. Then, upon rebooting, the machine had trouble booting up. It got so bad I had to go into Safe mode and uninstall the game before it began running smoothly again. I suspect it has something to do with the copyright protection software.The game itself may be awesome, but I have to give it a low rating because I just couldn't get it to run.Very disappointing."
3,Ok,They came and I couldn't tell what was what in the container. I used them but my plants still died so I don't know
2,Not shipped properly,"When you read the instructions that come with these, it mentions that these are live creatures and are supposed to be shipped at the correct temperature. There was no mention of this fact in the description, and they were mailed completely unprotected... it was late June. Needless to say, the surviving population, if any, was most likely significantly less than 7 million! The seller responded immediately to my complaint with a no-questions-asked refund... which was great. However, it would be nice if they incoporated some protection in their shipping method."
1,What?,There is no way for me to tell if these were alive when I got them. I saw no decrease in fungus gnats.
4,Giving it a try,I bought this as part of a bundle with a couple other garden provisions. It arrived very well packaged with an ice pack to insure the product was kept cool in transit. Instructions were clear and I did treat almost all of my plants. I kept a couple as a control for future comparison to verify results.
1,"nematodes, De-Flea, and Diatomaceous earth.","I ignored everyone when they told me it wouldn't work, just because the diatomaceous earth and the de-flea didn't do the job. So, with all good faith I went ahead and bought yet ANOTHER disappointment in my quest to rid our pets and home from fleas. Yes, I followed instructions for all ~!,( for those of you that might want to chime in there, and YES was let down , so much for this season, I wonder what WONDERFUL products there will be NEXT year that I can waste my money on ! Gee, wouldn't it be nice if you got what is promised in a product ? especially when you are disabled and can't afford bulls*** that doesn't work. My disability check WON'T be going to flea products again, unless its a BOMB ! Also had to buy another vacuum thanks to the DM gumming up my old one--Thanks EVER so !!"
3,I dunno.,"I used this product, and have no clue if it worked or not. I saw absolutely no difference. It's been four months, and I still see nutin'."
2,For Root Weevils...,"I have used nematodes quite alot trying to control my weavil problems. I've now found something better. I take 2 cups of water, a few drops of soap, a tablespoon of olive oil, and 3 twenty dollar bills. I blend them all up briskly into a paste, and place it around the base of my plants about every 4 days. It works much better than the nematodes, and its cheaper!!!"
3,A Fine Book for Children Learning About Hong Kong!,"The book about Hong Kong is really aimed for children. It's brief with colorful photographs and useful information. Since this book was published in 1998 after Britain handed over Hong Kong to China, the book is outdated but still has some interesting information.This is not a tour guide book at all. Children readers will come away reading briefly about Hong Kong's history and culture. Even though it's been 12 years since this book was published, some things haven't changed. If you are visiting Hong Kong, you don't need a visa to enter the city except if you are visiting China. Still, Hong Kong is pretty separate from China in most regards.But for a child reader, they'll enjoy the photographs and read briefly about visiting Hong Kong. I'm sure there are better books out there."
4,very readable text as well as a reference book,"this is a very readable book on semiconductor devices that operate on quantum principles. the book starts with Schrodinger's equations, discusses in detail the different perspectives of the particle in a box problem, then gradually develops to other theories, for example the Boltzmann transport equations. other processes (impact ionization) are also covered in detail. ofcourse optical processes are not discussed as this is only a device-level book. suitable for electrical engineers to learn the basic underlying concepts that dominate the present day state-of-the-art devices."
4,Works fine,"It's a stand, what more can I say. It holds the shaving brush as it should. It's hard to say anything more about this item."
4,Nice shaving stand for your shaving brush,I have mine stuck to the wall (double sided sticky tape included) above the sink on the marble wall and it holds my brush just fine. Not bad for the price.
1,Does not work for art of shaving trial kit brush!,"Call me naive, but I thought this stand would work with the brush that comes in the Art of Shaving trial kit. Why stock the kit with a smaller brush? Smaller bottles with less product? Yes. Smaller brush? Without stating so? While suggesting that you buy their stand?NO.So, it is decent quality for plastic and $11, but make sure you have the standard sized brush (which they do not define, and is not stated in the product description). Good luck!"
1,"Poor design, not universal","The bevel for holding the brush is too small, I have a standard issue boards head brush and it cant even fit it inside the thing without forcing it and having half the bristles sticking out, basically was a complete waste of money since it cant be used. For those who still want to try it the diameter of this holder is just a bit smaller than the narrowest point on a beer bottle, I don't know about you but that is a straight up dainty brush."
1,Not for Beginners,"If you are a beginner looking for a challenging tape, don't buy this one. It is in fact challenging, but it moves way too quickly. also, the instructed takes virtually no time at all to explain any of the moves. I am some what coordinated and I had a lot of difficulty following this work out. Also if you do decide to buy this tape, make sure you have plenty of room. Many of the moves have you treking all over the place, and if you don't have enough space, you'll be bumping into your furniture. For a much better workout, stick with Step Reebok The Video. I find Gin Miller to be a much better instructor."
2,Not a textbook,"This is a great history book but not a matlab book. Yes it is interesting and well written but I am almost through the first hundred pages and I will read no more. The math I found so far is thrown out without explanation. I skimmed through the book and found only one or two matlab examples. I thought from the title, that each step along the way to the development of radio would be given an example to enter into matlab so I could understand mathematically what was going on. The introduction says that any 2nd year student could use this book as long as they have had calculus. The author assumes you already know Kirchoff's Laws and Euler's formula. I am teaching myself after a 35-year layoff from my college days. I have obtained a ham license and have started studying electronics, math, and physics on my own. Apart from revealing the scandals behind Marconi and Tesla, I see no relevance for this book. I am very disappointed."
4,Another remake Hit!,"Look Out ""When Something is Wrong with my Baby"" should be the next duet hit of the year. Someone made a mistake putting ""Are We Rockin"" on this disk. It would seem Special needed a filler song and found it on the studio floor. He made up for this slip with Cool World and Mozart Street great up beat R&B. The Sleeper is ""Hold On"" Remember you heard it hear first.!"
2,Pretty but not pratical,"Dish is not recessed in the middle, any type of liquid, gravy or sauce WILL run off the sides-do not buy these, Im looking for a white square dish that is recessed to replace these!"
4,"Now, by The Tubes","The cover art alone makes it worth getting this album. Of course, Strung OUt on the Strings is my favorite song on this record. I hope this gets released on CD with the original cover art. That would be cool."
4,Fun but not Intense enough,"This is a fun and very doable dancey workout with a pleasant instructor and ok music. However, I consider myself advanced and know how to modify, so I added hand weights and jumps throughout to break a sweat. For example, there is a lot of marching between other moves, so I was jogging instead, or side-steps and I added ponies, and so on. All in all it was very easy to follow the first time through and I would consider it a fun low intermediate cardio workout."
4,captivating and informative,"picked up this number used. definitely worth the seven bucks that i shelled out for it. the subject, ""nute,"" is a very interesting one. the guy came from, basically, an iron-age existence in africa to emerge as american pro hoops player. albeit not a great player, but he DID make it, right? even if all of his ""talent"" was tied up in his height (an astounding 7'7""). an amazing story, and manute is portrayed as both intelligent and amusingly eccentric. still, montville's style of writing is a tad simple, so if you're used to and fond of, say, nineteenth-century russian-literature-in-translation, you'll find the complexity of syntactical structure and the level of descriptive detail to be somewhat lacking. then again, it's only a sportswriter talking about a ball-player. any hemingway fans out there?"
1,arn=ego,"even though the book has its interesting parts, it is poorly written with english mistakes through out. This is not the most annoying part though. Arn tries to make himself into the hardest working wrestler of all time and one of the best. Arn was a good wrestler but not the god that he tries to make himself through out the book. Also, there is so much filler like a page devoted to what hotel chains he likes. Who cares. Next time arn, hire someone to write for you"
4,A great read about one of Wrestlings greatest!,"What can I say? The book was written by Arn Anderson, AA! If you are looking for dirt here you wont find it. Arn doesn't say a lot about the other wrestlers, except funny stories. If you can get past the grammar and spelling mistakes - this book was rushed, by the looks of it - it is a great read, very pro-Horsemen with lots of ""We did it first"" comments...referring to the NWO."
2,Huge Disappointment...,"When I buy a wrestler's autobiography, I expect a few things, namely an honest, true-to-life portrayal of said performer's time in the business. I didn't get any of that here and that disappointed me greatly because I am and always will be a fan of Arn Anderson.This book is one big kayfabe (aka ""in-character"") mess. If this were twenty years ago, I'd understand Mr. Anderson's reluctance to expose the business, but this is a different day and age. Everybody, even fans, has been exposed to the truths behind professional wrestling. Heck, there has even been a reality show focused primarily on the training that goes into learning these basics.I find it silly that Anderson went the kayfabe route with his book, knowing what he does about the modern state of the business."
2,Disappointing Book,"I always loved to hate Arn Anderson but like a train wreck, you couldn't take your eyes off of the man as he was a great performer.My big gripe with the book is that Arn can't break ""kayfabe"" and tell some of the real life, behind the scenes stories of the business. He tells it as if it's all for real and not ""works"". Other books I've read, such as Bret Hart's and Bobby Heenan's first books are much better reads and have the inner workings of the business.Arn's book is a paperback and the pictures were not clear at all.. it almost looked like a second rate Xerox job so the quality overall was ""fair"". If I had to do it over again, I would have passed on buying this book.."
2,Jars are great looking BUT..,"I bought them for a friend that collects and gives canned items as gifts. The jars showed up in a timely fashion and look great, BUT the way that they are packaged to ship are horrible. Half of them were broken to pieces and I went to do a return to get them replaced and was put on a back order for over a month. NOT HAPPY!"
3,ABC Soaps In Depth,"The headlines on the cover are not on the inside. The cover gets you to buy the magazine, but does not deliver the goods. I don't think I will renew this subscription in a year."
5,Great watch!,"I like this watch a lot. It is very stylish and goes with both casual and formal wear. In addition, the quality is very good. I have knocked it hard against corners and metal edges and it has no scratches whatsoever. I have some other watches, but every time I want to choose a good one for making a good impression, this is my go to watch. The price is very good, too. I recommend it."
4,Classic GS guide,This reference gives all the pertinent data and photo's to help guide you to maintaining or repairing this great cycle. If you don't do maintainance then you will cause the need to repair or replace more parts.Recommended for anyone who is inclined to do it yourself and even those who don't should reference this for simple maintenance periods. Keep it running well!
5,Great Manual,"This manual is great as always. No complaints, easy to follow, great picture references. Helped me out several times with my bike."
2,Right-wing book with depressing atmosphere,This book was boring and contained way too much pro-conservative feelings. I would not recommend this book to most people. Don't be seduced by the comparisions of this book to those of Frank Peretti...there IS no comparision!
2,A real dissappointment.,"Being familiar with Burkett's non-fiction work, I looked forward to reading this novel. It turned out to be a big dissappointment. The book is filled with characters that are undeveloped and one-dimensional. There are also many inconsistencies and errors. I am afraid I could not recommend this book."
1,Disappointing,"I ordered four of these nice looking knives at a great price but am very disappointed with them. I put my knives in the dishwasher and after two washes, the knives had rust spots all over the cutting edge. Yes, the product description does say ""hand wash for best results"", but it does not say dishwashing will ruin the knives. I wouldn't have cared if the dishwasher made the knives turn color, but I do care that they are now rusted and unusable."
2,not very effective...,"I felt like this product didn't do very much for my hair. However, the fruity smell is terrific!"
3,small talk!,"this stuff smells awesome! it smells almost like trix cereal! it's a real fruity smell, i love it. but it kind of leaves weird white chunks in your hair when it dries. i've brushed it through my hair, thinking, maybe i was chunking it up in some spots, but i got the same results. i followed the instructions on the back, i don't know, maybe i'm using it wrong! but i find it best to help fight ponytail frizz and use it mainly for the smell of it!!!"
2,command line,"The ad said it was a little used, it was a lot used. It doesn't look very good. Thankfully it has all the pages."
5,Magna Carta never ceases to impress....,"I bought this album simply because I saw it in the store and it was a Magna Carta release, but let me tell you, this is one of the best releases of the year.This band is tough to explain; it really is that original. The killer tracks are ""This Golden Voyage"" and ""Seeing Eye God"" but I really enjoy all of tracks except for ""Perfect World"". Some of my friends like that track, so I guess it is just a matter of taste.Do yourself a favor and pick this album up."
5,Long Time Fan Thrilled with Release of UTS CD,"I've followed Under the Sun for years on the L.A. club scene, & knew they'd eventually get their break. This music is complex, exciting, and dynamic. It is fun to listen to; when I have it on as background music, I constantly find myself being drawn into it. The musicians are consumate professionals - they play well singly, but there is magic when they play off of each other. This magic is even more striking when you hear them in person. Their music has a dramatic element like Yes, and a majestic quality such as in ""The Wall"" by Kansas on Leftoverture. The music is more challenging & complex than these 2 examples, though, but the talents of the individual musicians working together pull it off into a seamless whole. Looking forward to the next one - go, UTS!"
5,AMAZING,"First impressions are great so far so good, if i had to complain about anything its the smell of the boot and a the slightest 3rd gear rattle. Im a ase cert. tech so install was cake to a average person with wrench skills it would still take 1hr max i did it in 20 min in the dark lol. it looks clean and has a really firm snap into gears i love it, and with the hurst name you know you are getting top quality! would highly recommend only wish i woulda bought it sooner!"
3,HELPING OUT,"To the lady that wanted to know the name of the song....if you are talking about the one where the two brothers end up alone together drunk and pass out, after all the dancing and rap music, the song is I'm All Out Of Love, by Air Supply! If thats not the one your talking, opps.Not a bad CD, good tunes! The movie was hillarious though!"
3,It depends what bands you like...,"About half of the songs on this soundtrack were ones that I personally enjoyed. I don't know if you feel the same way or not. I have not seen the movie yet, so maybe it makes a difference. Speaking of making difference, Sum 41's 'Makes No Difference' is on this soundtrack. I am a huge Sum 41 fan but my parents wouldn't let me get the 'Half Hour of Power' (which 'Makes No Difference' is on) CD due to the title of the first song. If your parents feel the same way, you should get this soundtrack because 'Makes No Difference' is a great song!"
3,"Decent, But bargain bin decent...","This is a fairly solid soundtrack. Has an up beat mood, Any common Alternative fan could get into. Lit, Sum 41 & Eve 6 songs are the highlights on here IMO. But there is still one flaw to be announced. The one song that in the movie stands for the two lead characters love for one another. Weezers ""Island In The Sun"" which would have made this compilation seem more complete.P.S. When will someone get the great idea of putting ALL the movies songs onto the soundtrack?!?"
4,"Great, but too many songs MIA","Ok, what is the name of the song when Jenny is sitting waiting on Rick called, and who is the singer?"
4,question on a song,"WHAT IS THAT SONG that is played when inga walks into El MAtador for teh first time,w hen shes in teh blue outfit and everyone is awestruck??? please help"
1,not what i had hoped,"this book was not as informative as i had hoped. very hard to follow and not for the home cook, like myself!"
5,Zen Journal,"The ""Zen"" Personal Journal is a blank journal filled with Zen quotations and teachings. The cover is a striking red with Kanji characters. This is perfect gift for either a man or a woman."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"The pros: This unit does make a lot of steam very fast.The cons: The top of the unit melted so now the top won't stay fastened. The tank in front to add scents doesn't work at all. I tried several times and reread the instructions; no luck.The $20 unit I got from Walgreens takes a lot longer to warm up, but you can add scented liquid to its pan very easily, though it quit working after about 7 uses.Bottom line: still looking for a good personal steamer to get me through cold and flu season. I would have returned this unit if the 30 day warranty was still in effect."
3,"Good, not great","Decent steam, smells plasticy, but the body of it broke after a couple of uses and we've taped it together. It works, but not thrilled with the quality"
1,The smell of plastic permeates the product,I am returning this product. The odor of the chemicals in the plastic is intolerable. I ran a full container of water through it and still can't get the odor to go away.
3,Mabis Steam Inhaler,"The inhaler has been a great help for my sinus problems but it is not well designed. The lid does not close properly and it falls apart from the base very often, and I am afraid that one of these days it will break when it falls down to the floor. Everytime I use the inhaler I have to secure the lid with my hand! Too bad they did such a poor design..."
3,INHALER,WORKS OK I GUESS BUT IT IS TIME CONSUMING GETTING IT READY TO USE AND THEN CLEANING IT AFTER. I THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP AND IT MIGHT BUT NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE TO SET IT UP FOR ME.
2,Very overpriced for what you get,Very overpriced for what you get! Boil water and put a towel over your head. Just as good
1,poorly made,"I've never bothered writing a review before but in this case I will. I was hoping this steamer would help with my allergies. Unfortunately, the top of the unit doesn't stay attached. As you can see in the picture, the top isn't balanced and since the cheap plastic snap together construction is of poor quality, I have to use rubber bands to hold it on. I brought this to the attention of the company, but they did not respond. I regret purchasing it and recommend you try a different brand."
2,Adequate but overpriced.,"I bought this to replace my second Vicks/Kaz steamer. The old ones had cracked easily, and I thought this would be a better quality. I do like the design much better and this does pour out a lot of steam, BUT the plastic has already cracked in two places. I have been careful due to prior experience but obviously not careful enough. When this one goes, I will go back to the old pan on top of the stove technique."
1,Mabis inhaler,I fallowed the instructions to the letter for operation. The second time I used it the water in the steam chamber leaked all over the place. Don't buy this product!!!!!!!!!!! I will package and return the product.
5,Great Inhalation Steamer!,"This inhalation steamer works perfectly. It is easy to fill, easy to use, the level of steam is adjustable, and the face piece is comfortable. Working in medical facilities and using respiratory therapy equipment , this is comparable. I just used it for my bronchitis, and added some essential oils to the reservoir. The steam really helped open up my airways, made it more comfortable for me to breathe, and helped my cough. The steam lasted for ten minutes and was still going strong before I turned it off. Highly recommend!"
4,Good Bike. Great Service,"My son selected this bike and is extremely happy with it. In fact, there are so many gears, he almost doesn't know what to do. I know very little about this bike/brand but seems as though he'll get a few good years out of it before he outgrows it. However, what I do know is that we received excellent service. Once we ordered the bike, we were told it would take 5-7 days. Of course, that was too long for my son who wanted it yesterday. Well... the FedEx man came down our driveway at 7pm on day 3. Great service!"
3,A Sad Story!,"It is hard to say I enjoyed the film because the content was so tough to digest. It depicts the life of hustlers from start to finish and details how bad things can go when they go bad. However, I would strongly recommend it to anyone with a child, nephew, etc... who is hustling or thinking of that lifestyle, cause this video will shut all those dreams of the glamorous lifestyle down, period!!!!!"
3,Mask protective cse,"It's a ok product I wouldn't spend the money for another. It's ""almost "" too small Mask Is protected and that's what I got Protection is what I wanted. Color? wish I had a choice"
2,Just didn't do anything for me,"I liked Satisy Me by Lori Foster but had already read it in another anthology.Stranger in Her Bed - who believes that the guy in her computer was cursed. WHAT!?!No Mercy - hasn't seen the ex in seven years but just tips over into bed with him. And that's after she says, multiple times, that she's not going to have sex with him.Something Wild - cute. Not quite sure why Annie was so willing to walk on the wild side and then be angry when she found out Jacob wasn't quite so wild. The rest of the story is pretty good but that part confused me. She thinks about how expensive his clothing is at the beginning - where would a big, bad, down on his luck, biker get a $2000 jacket?Overall - just didn't do anything for me."
2,Not too hot and steamy.,"These types of books are always a hit or a miss. I do like to read them from time to time though to try new authors and see if I like any of them. I bought this particular book because I really enjoy ready Lori Foster's romance novels. This book didn't really do it for me though. I did enjoy Lori Foster's story and REALLY enjoyed Shannon McKenna but I was not really impressed with Thea Devine's story. It seemeds a bit bland. Also, this book didn't really fit the genre of 'erotic' romance, I have have read far more in depth books in that genre then this book lends itself to."
5,Wicked Scary Page Turning Thriller,"I don't often read thrillers but I read this one on the recommendation of a friend, and I have to say that I loved it. The action sequences were great and kept me turning the pages well into the night, but I think it was the characters who truly made it for me. The heroes were well developed and sympathetic, so much so that I found myself mad at Charles Gramlich whenever one of them got hurt, or worse. The villians were wicked scary. This is definetly one you will want to read with all the lights on. Gramlich turned this one out like a pro, though I understand from what I've read that this book is his first paperback. I hope it won't be his last! I like the idea of discovering a new writer who I can enjoy. I recommend this book highly and hope one day to see it as an action-packed summer blockbuster."
1,Painful,I wish I had read the reviews if this book before I decided to read it. I had such high hopes for this book! I keep trying to finish it but it is so tedious. The women are as snotty in their treatment of and attitudes toward the local women as they claim those women are to them. The plot is lumbering. I love British chick lit but this is just awful.
4,Oscar's enjoyable tribute to the classic bolero.,"On this fine CD, Oscar pays tribute to the classic boleros of yesteryear and most of his renditions are quite enjoyable. True, Oscar is not as great a bolerista as Cheo Feliciano, Santos Colon or Tito Rodriguez but his unique versions of some of the standards featured here are thoroughly enjoyable. Buy it while you still can."
3,A fun listen--but doesn't approach wolf at his best,"This album was my introduction to the Wolf, and I loved it. It was after I had heard some of his other work and then came back to the London Sessions that I found myself disappointed. Howlin' Wolf possessed the most distinctive voice in blues--a genre full of distinct voices. The London Sessions feature a fairly ill, and rather old Howlin' Wolf, and he simply doesn't have the raw power that he possessed on earlier albums. The songs on this album are good as always, and the Rolling Stones' rhythm section, the Eric Clapton guitar work, give Wolf an updated rock feel. If you're looking for classic blues songs with a slightly smoother feel and production, this is definitely a great purchase. But if you want Wolf at his most powerful, check out something earlier, like ""Moanin' in the Moonlight""."
5,one of the most powerful books on jewish history ever written,"When I was visiting Germany some years ago I happened to stop in a bookshop in Munich, where I saw an English copy of Hitler's Willing Executioners, by Goldhagen. Bringing this, along with a Sunday NYT to the counter, I was met with ghoulish silence from the tellers. Inhabitants of the shop glanced at me, and my purcahses, with looks that had ice water in them. Reading Goldhagen's book on my trip through Germany was an unforgottable experience - I could not have asked for a better travel guide.The soul and theme of Levin's book can be summed up in the remark made 48 hours ago by Abbas to Sharon: ""You hurt me by not giving me what I need. You use terror as an excuse not to give me what I need. You only make matters worse.""A great difficult and worthy read."
5,Very good capacity,Very good capacity! For a month of use in my camera I have charged them just once (about 2000 photos -canon A480)
5,Used for many years,"I've used these batteries for at least 2 years with a Sony charger (BCG-34HE), and I have not been disappointed. They do lose charge when not in use (maybe, in 3-4 weeks), but they recover quickly when I need them. I've used them in wireless Xbox controllers, Canon S3 and Canon external flash units. Recommended"
2,"Sony 2500 mAh AA rechargeable Nimh batteries, 4 pak",Not as many shots as other batteries before needing recharging.$7+ postage for 5 oz. a bit excessive.
1,poor battery life,"I have used Nimh rechargeable batteries for years now for digital cameras, and my experience has been that new batteries can last for hundreds of shots, especially if the flash is not used. However, these batteries I suspect must be a bad batch, because after only 10-30 pictures the low battery indicator comes on. I had not opened them for several months after I purchased them and actually thought there must be a mistake on my part, but after a few uses found they were not lasting. When I got around to looking at my purchase order it was too late to ask for a refund. I did write a note to Amazon but after a week, no response. Sony is a good brand and previous Sony batteries worked fine. Not sure if these were old or a bad batch, but a word to the wise to be careful and check these out as soon as you get them."
1,Useless - really disappointed.,"We purchased these batteries with the charger confident in the name brand and the customer reviews. What a joke. The batteries lack the needed voltage (even fully charged) to run ANY of our devices. Regular AA batteries are 1.5 volts, these are 1.2 volts. They don't have enough power to run our Flip video camera, Vtech children's camera, or any of my sons baby toys...they are basically useless to us. We have yet to find a single device that these will run. VERY DISAPPOINTED...I've never been so disgusted in a SONY product.WARNING TO ALL RECHARGABLE BATTERY BUYERS - CHECK THE VOLAGE OF THE BATTERY YOU PURCHASE OR YOU MAY BE STUCK WITH USELESS BATTERIES AS WELL. Not even the Eneloop batteries are ""strong"" enough - they too are 1.2 volt. Until rechargables are the same voltage as disposable - I guess I am stuck with being wasteful in order to run my battery-operated devices."
3,Just OK batteries,"Purchased these batteries for a flash for my camera, but they died pretty quickly. It's probably just because I'm expecting too much from them, but they don't last very long."
5,Good buy for rechargeable batteries,These batteries are a really good deal. They last way longer than other batteries we've tried in our cameras.
5,Wonderful,These work great in my Canon 430 EX flash. They last a decent amount of time and recharge quickly. I usually carry a few sets in my camera bag to shoot a wedding.
2,Low quality as other battery made in china,"Please describes that the battery are ""made in china"" because other battery sony made in japan are superior in battery life and recharge times."
1,NOT THE SAME IN THE PICTURE,"Probably the batteries are good, or the best, or bad... I don't know yet. But The batteries and the package are not the same as the picture and that's just wrong. I have used previously the batteries from the picture and they are great, and that's the only reason I bought these. How am I suppose to know if the product I received is exactly the same quality I ordered?."
4,reliable performance,"I bought these batteries initially 3 years ago before a trip to Alaska. They worked great all day, every day. I just charged them up at night and they were ready for another full day of sight-seeing and picture taking. Now, after three years of pretty consistent use, they no longer hold a charge for very long. I think they had a pretty good run, so, I just bought my second set."
4,Works well so far,no issues yet with this product. Seems to hold the charge pretty long. Just keep in mind they do not come pre-charged
1,Horrible Horrible,"I bought these batteries when I bought the Sony charger. The charger is cool, the batteries are the worse I've ever had. Even in a clock, they last about 3 days on a full charge. What's the deal with that?"
5,These are what I use in my camera,"I have two sets of these, so I always have a set charged and ready to go, but so far it's been good enough to replace my batteries once a week and recharge the set I took out. I use them in myFujifilm FinePix HS10after reading a lot of reviews that said that the Eneloops don't last long in that camera.These have been good for me in terms of battery life and how many pictures I can get off a charged set. I'm planning to pick up a couple more sets for some of the other electronics we use regularly."
2,Not holding charge long,"After I owned 2 sets, 4 months. I throw them to trash because they discharge very fast rate when not in use, just the name brand, but quality is questionable. I had older Panasonic set with lower milliamp rating I still kept because of holding long time the voltage when not in use."
5,Long lasting batteries,With the name Sony you can't go wrong. These rechargable batteries last a long time between charges. Saves money in the long run.
1,I am still waiting for the order,It is like one month now i am still waiting for my order I am really having hard time in chasing the seller
2,Misunderstanding,"I thought I was buying a bridge CD that would actually involve bidding of the hands by four players, myself being one. I have one such CD and wanted another one with different scenarios. I don't recall seeing an explanation onscreen of what the CD was all about. My mistake in ordering it, I guess. I would very much like to return it, but seem to have lost the return label, etc.If it's possible to return it I would like to know the procedure, as I will probably never use the CD.Thank you for your interest.kit-kat"
5,"Beautiful gifts for wedding, birth, anniversary, graduation,",These are exquisite gifts for special occasions...especially weddings and anniversaries. Also gave them to new parents as baby gifts. HIGHLY recommend. I paid more than previous reviewer (a lot!) but it's worth every penny. Very tasteful and memorable gifts.
1,Product never arrived.,Not to sure where this product went too but I never got it. Has been couple months now :-(
5,Hot Chocolate,I don't think people should buy advance devices or phones if you aren't planning on utilizing the features on the phone. It's like buying an Audi A8 but you walk everywhere???? I Dont get it??
4,Not a stinkaroony.,"You probably won't watch this one with all your friends. It definitely is for acquired tastes. If you're into John Waters type, semi trashy films, that strike back against certain self righteous groups, I would say you will enjoy it. This is probably how they enticed JW to do the religious figure cameo, in the drug induced strip bar sequence. The characters are funny and quirky with a quasi-realistic trailer park charm. I give it 4 stars for doing what it does well. The staging of the musical number could have been a little shorter without taking away from tne story."
1,Cheap thin breakable plastic -- wont last a year.,"I remember the Brita filter from 20 years ago and this isnt it. The cover has a tiny lip, so it can easily fall out when pouring. And the plastic overall is hilariously thin. Taking the parts off to clean it offers a risk of the whole thing cracking. I've tried the other Brita pitchers and they all have issues of one sort or another. But this pitcher would have been 3 stars if it were make of thicker plastic. I rarely give one star reviews but this deserves it."
3,Great Tasting Water,"I have a love hate relationship with this pitcher. The water is very good. But, the pitcher is small and if you drink a lot of water, get a bigger pitcher. I only recommend this for a single person. My son and I have to constantly refill it because we drink a lot of water. When you tip it over, the filter can come out very easily, so you have to be careful and hold the lid when you pour. You have to wait for all the water to filter through, before you use it."
3,decent...,"nice and comfy; however, the padding is pretty thick, and shows through tight/slinky tops, in a bad way...also, the 'lily of france' on the label had been cut out with a marker; i wonder why? are they used or something? they werent even packed in boxes; just all four together in a sealed plastic cover...but theyre cheap and quite comfy..."
3,Christian meditations for moms,"I bought this book from Amazon based on the title alone since there were no prior reviews and no ""look inside"" option. I am trying to find short, non-religious daily readings to encourage me as a mom. This book has 45 day readings, each about 2-3 pages, that begin with a Bible verse. I only glanced through the book, but the readings seem fine if you want a Christian emphasis. They seem to use her experience as a mom of one as a springboard to discuss mom-related topics, ending with an ""application"" idea for your own life. I gave it three stars since it seems decent enough for what it is, but a bit frustrating that it did not indicate its religious bent. It wasn't what I was looking for, so I will continue my search..."
1,Cheaply Made but $$$ priced,It is barely September and the Dock already stopped working. For that kind of $$$....you would think it would be made better.
5,Win for Apple (and me),"I see many people like to bash this particular item. I don't know if they leave in on the floor and purposefully try to step on and break it or what. I simply misplaced mine original dock during a move and had to replace it. The first one worked perfectly well as does this one. I keep in in a drawer. It's out of potential harm so it won't break... really people. Get a grip. If it doesn't work for you then buy a 3rd gen shuffle already. For me, I'm happy. :)"
2,Apple Device,Expensive accessory for small plastic device. Already gave it away with the Ipod shuffle I bought at the same time.
1,Buyers beware,"Ordered this dock as a replacement for the original dock that came with my son's IPOD. It is advertised as retail packaging, which it is not. This dock is visibly worn, the cord is dirty and there is dirt/rust on the USB plug. It was contained in a small ziplock bag and then wrapped in 2 small pieces of foam and put in an unpadded envelope for shipping. The metal plug in on the dock itself is bent (whether from shipping, or from prior damage, I don't know) and the dock is not functional. Disappointing purchase, will return this item and pay more to purchase it in a store where at least I know I'm getting what I need."
2,Didn't last long,I bought this used and it only lasted for about a month. I will now go to the Apple store and buy a new one which I should have done from the beginning.
1,Does not work as expected!,"This does not work well with Treo 600 at all. You have to keep a button pressed all the time to talk on your phone, what kind of hands-free is that!"
1,Dont buy these head phones !,I had these head phones/ear piece for under a month and they fell apart .
5,Informative and interesting!,"An amazing book, written about a practical machine in a way that's not dry and theoretical. If you are still studying in CE/EE, this is a book that'd perk your interest even more in the field. As I read Huang's book, I couldn't help but feel his excitement as he hack through the security encryptions built into the XBox.It's written in formal yet... somewhat casual manner for easy reading. I recommend it to anyone that have a desire to understand how computers. Especially to freshmen in universities thinking about becoming an engineer!"
3,not exactly what I was looking for,"This book could be a good resource for someone interested in general hacking and reverse engineering, but it fails to provide enough details or describe enough Xbox-specific projects to be truly called ""Hacking the Xbox"". Maybe if the title had just been ""Hacking"" it would have lived up to my expectations. As such, I feel that Jonathan Harbour's ""The Black Art of Xbox Mods"" was more what I was looking for. Still, this book has some value for me, particularly the soldering tutorial."
4,COOLEST LIVE CRUST SET EVER RECORDED !!!!!!,"Recorded at a festival in Nottingham in `82, 15 songs, 39 '. If you can live with a little imperfection-this one sounds far from perfect-you'll experience one of the most exciting gigs in the history of HC Crust.I'm a audio freak and tend to discard whichever records I can't make to sound at least more or less OK.This one has little treble so I applied plenty of eqs and other signal processing and it sounded good except for the guitar that goes louder and louder on the right channel as the gig progresses.But I really did'nt care.The attitude-call it guts, balls, whatever-put in this live performance is so mind bending I didn't care . Believe me,if you like raw,powerful,in your face live redords,this'll be one you'll really treasure.Nuff said !!!"
3,KeKe Wyatt.....,"I know this cd has been out for a few years but I like to go back into the archives, from time to time and pull out songs & cd's that make great slow jam playlists on my IPOD. Well, KeKe Wyatt does not disappoint especially when it comes to her sultry voice and slow jams beats that I desire. Now, he cd was not all that hott but the 3 songs that I like are: (1) If Only You Knew (2)Nothing In This World (3)Don't Take Your Love. Whether you like KeKe Wyatt or not, you have to admit that she has a great voice. Her slow songs are on automatic repeat status in the ride and at the crib. I hope this helps. YMMV..NEOSOUL."
3,patti labelle girl you need to quit,"okay keke's cool but she's no patti labelle and does'nt come close to her level, still this is an okay cd though."
4,refill filters for PUR pitchers,"PUR filters take out the cocopods(as well as larger impurities) that populate the NYC water supply and leave the fluride in the water(dental protection). Additionally, pitcher filters last longer that those placed on the sink spout and cost less. Amazon provides the lowest price since retail purchase is higher and this item usually will qualify for free shipment when buying 2 packs."
5,Have used these filters for many years,All bad taste is removed from the water. They are very easy to install in the pitcher. I prefer this system to a bulky filter on the faucet but that is a personal preference.
4,"Convenient, pure, but costly","I don't know of any better product on the market, but with my water supply these wear out in about a month. It's probably no fault of the product itself, more the fault of the water quality coming in."
2,An downgrade from previous version?,"I have been using PUR for 10 years and have seen several generations of PUR filters. The last generation is the one with orange indicator that tells the life of the filter.Now, PUR has smartly integrate this indicator inside the latest version of filter, where the filter will stop filtering (water stop dripping down the container) around the 60th day of usage! Now I have to rush to buy another replacement filter..., what a hassle!!"
3,Trickle down filternomics,"For the first week of using this filter, the water would filter through very quickly. Now that I've been using it for about 3 weeks, it takes over 20 minutes to filter a full load. I've seen other filters work much faster, so I would not recommend this one.However, seeing as this is a replacement pack, you probably already own the pitcher so this is the only filter you could buy. Too bad."
4,pur filters purchase,The new filters don't have a way to measure when they are used up like the old ones used to. Measuring 3 months on the little stick-on calendar is not all that accurate. I could have a family of 6 or just one and could use 3 gallons of water a day or 2 quarts. That means I may be throwing out a filter before it has truly been used. They are also really hard to find in the stores.
1,Don't buy from this seller,"I bought the 3 pack and after 1 week the tank would only fill 25% which makes the filter virtually useless. My guess is the filters are very old, have been sitting on a shelf and just do not function properly. This is the first time I have encountered this problem so find another dealer."
2,Worked well for two weeks...,"It worked well for two weeks, then the filter started filtering very slow. As soon as the filtered water goes above two inches the filter slows down a lot - like it takes hours to filter the last 1/4 inch of water. I'll try the second filter from the 2-pack and adjust my review if it performs better. I'm the only one using it."
5,very good filter,"I couldn't stand any funny taste in the drinking water, and this 2 stag filter indeed get rid of most of the stuff out of it. I have been using it for the past 4 years or so. It's a shame that Costco no longer carry it."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"I have been using the PUR water filters for over 2 years successfully. The last batch of three filters I purchased through Amazon experience the same problems other reviewers have reported. They work well for about 1 week (or less) and then stop filtering the water. I have filled the unit and had the water sit there for over 2 hours and not drain down into the pitcher. I thought perhaps it was just the first one in the pack that was defective, but it happened to all three. Then I figured perhaps I just got a bad batch all together due to a manufacturing defect, until I read the other reviews. Do not waste your money, obviously PUR filters have gone down hill."
5,Works great,Very good product. I've been using them for years now. Could'nt be happier. i just keep stocking them up whenever they are on discount for $17 for 3.
2,Does not filter the stated amount,PUR CRF-950Z-2 Stage Repalcement Filters.This does not filter the stated amount of water. I could only filter 8 gallons before the filter began to just trickle the water. Did not care for them at all.
3,Pricing ???,"This product works well overall. However, if you don't like the tast of tap water then you might want to buy a completely different filter system/With that being said, why is it more expensive to buy a 4 pck instead of the 3 pck?!?! That make no sense at all."
1,Dirty Filters,"Two of the filters were wet and looked as though they had been used. Would request that new filters be issued, please."
3,Liked the old version better,"I also preferred the previous version of this filter. I'm sure P&G; changed it to be cost-effective. I'm still ordering it but am on the lookout for a better system. The filter cartridge tab was the reason I'd switched from Brita.If enough people complain, maybe they will bring the previous version back."
2,New style doesn't fit cooler,"I own a Pur water cooler and purchased the replacement filters. The filters are redesigned. With the new design, the water tank doesn't fit exactly as with the old filters. The cooler still works but the tank doesn't sit correctly on the cooler."
4,so far so good,I bought the Pur water dispenser and the filter catridges last november and I am happy with Pur. The con is one has keep tab when the catridge needs to be changed based on the sticker on the that comes with the catridge. I will recommend this. They claim to do a better job than Brita.
3,"Good filter, but it won't soften your water","These filters work fine for improving the taste of water and removing impurities, but when it comes to the way it feels in your mouth Brita takes it up a notch. Brita filters are the only filters on the market that soften water with silver oxide pellets that act just like expensive water softening equipment. From what I can tell the Brita filters (dispensers, pitchers, and replacement filters) are all less expensive than Pur."
5,Money saver,"This is cheaper and safer for the environment to just buy these filters. I don't know if it really makes a ""difference"" in terms of the quality of the water, but the water I drink definitely tastes fresh and does not seem to contain any impurities."
4,Makes great water,"If you're buying this, it means you own a PUR water pitcher of some kind and don't have much choice about your filter purchase. Same here. But these make great tasting water, last fairly long, and are relatively inexpensive. I only gave it 4 stars, because I just can't get excited enough about a water filter to give it 5 stars. I don't have any complaints."
2,Called Procter & Gamble about the missing Monitor feature,"First off, I want to thank all the reviewers for having called to our attention the missing monitor feature on the new version of this filter.Like many others, the advice of replacing the filter every ""one or two months"" is of little help--our use varies greatly. These filters are not cheap!I called P&G;: they say the monitor was often inaccurate so it was removed. They stick to their ""replace filter every one/two months."" HOWEVER, they also say: ""replace the filter when you notice it takes longer than usual to filter a pitcher's worth of water; the filter will not leach impurities, simply begin to clog up and take much longer to filter the water.""Considered switching to Brita but PUR filters out many more impurities than Brita."
3,"Good deal on these, all things considered","The PUR 2-stage water pitcher filters used to last for MUCH longer (like 5 or 6 times longer) but they've made some change such that now the water flow begins to slow down fairly quickly with a new filter, and will soon thereafter simply stop flowing. They've found a way to force the consumer to buy new filters by creating some sort of blockage within the filters. If not for deals like this, I would've chosen to go with another brand and type of water filtering, because I feel like what PUR has done is a ripoff for the consumer and I prefer to not give my money to companies like that. At $6+/filter, I still think that's too much for a month or two, so will probably be switching to another brand soon."
1,Wrong product,"The description was too vauge, and we needed the filters for the sink unit, not these huge filters. The trouble with online is that you cannot just return them to the store, you have to pay shipping or keep it...... Otherwise they would have been good....."
4,Pur Water Filter,"Great Product, fits in firidge, makes great tasting water. Easy to keep the tank filled so cool clean water is on tap at will. Have only had the unit less than a month so I can't speek on how long the filters will last. So far so go. No more plastic jugs to recycle. Never run out and have to go to the store. My oly question is: is there a filter recycle program for this product? That would be the ultimate. Then I would give it 5 stars."
3,"Indicator light is a little ""speedy.""","Pur's new blinking light indicator seems unreliable to me. I'll still use the filter, but I keep track of it on my calendar because last time it indicated that I needed a new one after just 4 weeks. I drink normal amounts of water, don't use it for the coffee maker or make soup with it, so replacement after 4 weeks was ludicrous. I kept using it another month and will keep an eye on the next one. If it konks out after just a few weeks as well, I may complain to Pur or scrap this product all together. too expensive to replace once a month! I suspect it's a trick by them to make you purchase more often."
1,Bad batch product,"I have been using these water filters for a year. The filters I ordered in the past worked fine. But the recent shipment I got appears to be some bad ones because the water just don't go from the top chamber to the bottom chamber even in a few days. At the beggining, I thought it was just one of the four, so I replaced the first one, opened a second, then same story. It still does not work. The water has been held on the top chamber for three days now."
1,Very dissapointed,"Considering myself a light user - about 3 liters daily, I bought the 3-pack about couple months ago and I am down to the last filter. The first two worked from two to four weeks and the water just stopped running through. I have had the PUR dispenser for about 2 years and haven't had this problem before. I contacted the company and they wrote back to me, blaming our water and giving me instruction on how to properly use the filter, acting like they have never heard of this issue before.I hesitate to buy these again as I perceive it as an incredible waste of money."
4,Could be better,"The old model had a built in indicator that told you when it needed to be replaced.This unit just has a sticker that reminds you to replace it every 2 months.Of course, this does not take into consideration how many gallons you have processed.So, it is not a good guide to the actual condition of the filter.I'd pay an extra dollar to have a more accurate indicator.However, it does produce great tasting water."
3,Lasted shorter than it used,"I have been using this filter for a few years. Just like the other reviewers said, the filters these days lasted much shorter than before. In my case, it's like 2 months vs 6 months. Also, the red indicator is gone, which I don't understand why they took away such a nice feature. Makes me think twice about buying another PUR product."
1,3 hours per pitcher,"How long do you expect a water filter to last? Maybe the advertised 60 days?I make two pitchers of water a day. My last four Pur filters (from two separate boxes ordered months apart) have gone ""slow"" on me within 3 weeks of starting them. 1-3 hours for a pitcher of water is not acceptable, and since this behavior is new within the last year, it's rather suggestive of a company trying to pressure us into buying a new box sooner than they advertise we'd need to.I'm in Mountain View, CA, where the unfiltered water is pretty good, so it's not an issue of my input water having more pollutants than average. (For reference, the water here is better than Santa Fe, Chicago, DC, LA, and just about everywhere else in the US. So if you live in a place with water about as hard or harder than in any of those places, expect these filters to slow down on you even sooner than they do for me.)"
1,Filters clog,"Clearly PUR has changed their product -- and the glowing reviews in the past are not for their current offering. The filters clogged and water could not pass after about 3 days (3-4 refills of the container). We had a four pack, so we tried all four of them using warmer and colder water, not filling it as full, etc. It did not work. We are contacting PUR to see if they will be reengineering the filters. Until they do, do not buy this product."
1,Very disappointed,The filter works good for about 2-3 weeks then it now filters very slowly if i want water to drink i have to filter overnight. Bad design that i think was done on purpose to buy filters more frequently don't think i will want another pur filter. So i guess am gonna have to go hunting again
3,Good filters just not the price.,Not a good deal at the price. Menard's has 3 filters for 15 dollars.
4,Does the job,Have been using it for a few years. Only complaint is for whatever reason this type is not widely available in stores when compared to Bretta brand
5,One of the Greatest,"This book is one of the greatest. Gordon Korman is, in my opinion, the best fiction author of the 20th and 21st centuries. I LOVE his books, and wish all the great old ones were back in print. I highly recommend his books to all the readers I meet. Thankfully, among my siblings and I, we have several of the old books, but I wish they were all more readily available, as we don't have some of our favorites. I don't think words can adequately express how beloved these books are; they are a delightful read. The person who decided they should go out of print must be insane or have no taste. If I were a school administrator, I would have all the children read these books, especially this one. They are a shining star among the trash that is out there today for young people."
5,I loved it,"It is not for those looking for a hi quality movie, but I liked it. I still watch it everyday."
5,Sturdy yet easy to build,I've used this gate kit to build 2 gates so far and just bought a 3rd kit. It's so nice and sturdy and does not give ANY indication it will EVER sag! Very solid fell when you slam it shut. Love it so far and the price can't be beat. Amazon shipped it right away so also enjoyed speedy free delivery! Great experience all around!!!!
2,Very disappointed,"I made two 4x8' gates this morning, cutting all wood to the exact size needed, and when I went to hang them on the 4x4 posts (which I double-checked to make sure they were exactly vertical) they weren't square. Not sure how I'm going to fix it, but I am sure I won't be using these things again."
2,Poor quality but salvageable,"Rusted within 2 weeks of semi-rainy weather. Hinges bent from weight of door within 6 months. All the screws rusted within a month. I suggest if you must buy this product because there are little to no other choices you do these things first.1. Repaint all of the metal work with rust protection.2. Get different screws, stronger and longer ones with rust coating.3. MUST also add a separate middle hinge (or more for heavier doors).The idea of the hinge connected to the bracket is neat until you've had to replace a broken hinge. Also, remember, you can get plain metal brackets and separate hinges from the store for about the same price of this whole package. After trying to remove rusted screws from a huge gate - I wished I had never bought this product or at least did the 3 things I listed here first."
5,Fantastic Portable Speakers with Great Bass Sound,"I think there are only two portable speaker systems on the market worth purchasing, and this is one of them. Most are sorely lacking in bass sound. The Maxx bass technology is pretty amazing. This set of speakers is small, light (between 22 - 28 oz.) folds flat, has great battery life, uses easily replaceable batteries (4 AA's will play for 6 to 18 hrs depending upon volume), and these speakers work with any portable music device. You can actually connect two devices at the same time. My husband and I like the retractable cable and the fact that they easily pack into a backpack or kayak. Very simple and practical solution for portable music. Great design and great sound. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for something very portable for use in the outdoors or even for playing in a hotel room when traveling."
5,Highly recommended,"These speakers deliver quality sound for a pretty good price- Altec Lansing is a great audio system company, and these speakers have been perfect for me. They can be plugged into an outlet and be used, or they can run off 4 AA batteries for about 4.5 hours. They're very portable, and even come in their own carrying bag. There are also some charger adapters that will work in other countries."
3,Okay... for the price,"This sound system is okay. Only okay. The picture is deceiving as to the size and the appearance of style. They sound fair-to-good, but their volume range is extremely limited. They'll do for what I need them for ."
4,Eye opening,"I was actually quite shocked to find that so many parents were SO mortified and ashamed when they found out their child was gay/lesbian. I bought this book looking for a little camaraderie, since I don't know of anyone who also has a gay/lesbian child. I don't struggle with the same conflicts with religion or social pressures that the parents who were interviewed for the book seemed to, but I can see that this would be an INVALUABLE tool for those who are struggling. I would highly suggest it for anyone who ""just doesn't understand"", but not for someone like myself. My heart bled for those poor kids whose parents rejected, chastised and otherwise made them feel horrible for who they are. I was looking for a book that celebrates our gay/lesbian kids."
1,can't tell yet,"This video is in PAL format and I have not yet been successful in transferring it to NTSC format, hence I have not yet viewed it. This is more of a pain than I had originally envisioned, and I warn other potential purchasers to consider their resources before ordering a DVD in foreign printed format."
3,leaf/feather earrings,the picture makes these earrings look beautiful but in real life they are not quite so. the brass is very thin and it basically just has one green stripe down the middle of the earring... not very natural/pretty at all. seems as if someone rushed to color these. would be much better if the green was applied like in the picture. this is the second time i have bought from this seller. seems their jewelery is always less sturdy/appealing than seems in the description/picture
2,Kind Of A Rip off,"I don't get it. The single Cd of this great CD is very good. It gives you the CD in remastered sound, plus a few bonus cuts. A good value. This ""Deluxe"" edition gives you the original cd, and then the ""Criteria"" cd. Both the band and the record company felt the Criteria album was not acceptable, and one listen lets you know why. Then there are the bonus ""live"" cuts. Anyone expecting good sound is in for a shock. It a poorly recorded bootleg! This ""Deluxe"" package runs about $30.00 and the only good thing is the original Cd, which is a lot cheaper in the single disc edition. This is the record company trying to make a buck off this legendary band. Shame on them."
3,Not the best Skynyrd album by far!,"I love Lynyrd Skynyrd, every damn thing about them except for this album. I just never could get into this one. The only songs I like are the commercial ones which is quite sad. 'I Know A Little' 'That Smell' and 'Little Girl' are the only songs I was able to get into. The rest of the album was just boaring for me. After this was released Van Sandt was killed in the plane crash and the band was never the same! This is not an album I would recomend to new fans of Lynyrd Skynyrd because to be frank, its not all that good. Go with One More From The Road, Pronounced, or Second Helping all of which are way better then Street Survivers!"
5,Lens adapter ...fits great!,"I needed a Lens adapter for my Kodak P712. this one fit the bill and the price was right.fits like a glove with my telephoto lens.great price, fast delivery. very happy!"
1,I was ripped off,"First of all it was the wrong item, second after contacting Amazon 4 times they ignored me and by that time it was too late and I never got my money back even after sending it back with a written letter and all pertinent information. I bought another one for $16 more and chalked it up. I want to see if there is new mgmt working the shipping dept. and take a chance. I'm logging all information now and will take legal action this time.They lost lots of business as I blogged them and received mucho reply mail telling me of cancelled orders. I told them to give Amazon another chance in the next years future. Working for a well known gaming company has many followers and perks. I'll let you know what happens. The other items were sent w/o a hitch, gr8 biz"
2,leaky,"I ordered this cooler. When it arrived it wasn't blue but red and gray which, is fine i guess. It had alot of great features but, when i actually used it, it leaked. I had some ice in it with food and once the ice started melting it started leaking a good amount, and that kinda sucked. There was no holes or tears in it but, it still leaked."
1,Killed one cat and my other cat is struggling to survive,"Please do not buy this product. My vet confirmed that this product killed one of my cats and my other cat is struggling to survive. The ingredient in this product is a known toxin to cats. Please do your research. I didn't and today I am mourning the death of my beloved kitty and praying for my other one.There are multiple websites discussing the risks with this medicine.- [...]- [...]- and many, many morePlease don't use this!"
1,Don't waste your money!,I bought this product in hopes of helping my cat with his flea problem. It left oily area and had to bathe. It drove him insane and he kept trying to lick the area (obviously didn't let him). I wouldn't waste your money even trying a 1 month supply.
4,Not bad,It's a little pricey and the 56inch I put on it does fit but you can pretty much push the TV right off if you're not careful. Watch out if you have kids - your expensive TV can go flying and the glass shelves are not good for kids who trip near it. I'm considering getting a kid proof screen to put around the base.
4,Samsung stand,"I had very few choices for stands because I needed the TV to fit inside a given space and was limited by height. My 3 choices were a tech craft the samsung, or a piece of furniture. The samsung ended up being the best because it looks like part of the TV.The glass is sturdy and the rods hold decent weight so that there is no fear of having to heavy a receiver down there. If you remove the shelves you can even fit a small subwoofer below the TV.If you have the stand set at the narrowest setting like I do there is no concern of buckling, but I can see why people would hesitate if their TV is 50"" or wider. The 'extensions' may not make for great support.We're happy with the stand because it does what it's supposed to do and was easy to set up. If only it came in wood finishes..."
4,Works as promised,"I ordered the TR46X3 TV Stand for a Samsung 50"" DLP TV (model HL-R5067W). While this stand is compatible with a number of Samsung DLP sets ranging from 46"" to 56"", a unique width adjustment part is included for each TV size supported. This provides the look of a ""custom fit"", regardless of the TV size. I was pleased with well written and easy to follow assembly instructions.My only complaint is that there is no way to lock or attach the TV to the stand (the TV simply sits on top of it)."
3,So so,"Plot was slow and left nothing to mystery. It wasn't horrible to read, but I found myself getting bored quickly with it and wanting to finish it to get to a more entertaining book."
2,Not decked - flogged! The dead horse.,"This is Carol Higgins Clark's first book. A friend gave me the book and I paid too much for it. I can't say this is the worst book I have ever read, but it is close. As an author, Carol Higgins Clark has fallen far from the tree. Her mother, Mary Higgins Clark is known as the Queen of Suspense. Carol isn't the Princess nor close to being the heir apparent.Regan Reilly is a private detective in England for the tenth reunion of her class. The body of one of her classmates, who all thought had run away prior to graduation, is discovered near a professor's home. Regan is able to put pieces of the crime together while accompanying an elderly woman on a cruise to New York City.Higgins Clark relies on cliched characters and situations. Despite the vapidness of this book, I will try another of the series to see if Carol Higgins Clark's writing matures. And, yes, I'm still talking to the friend her gave me the book. Turns out she had very similar feelings about it."
4,An excellent book,An excellent book by Carol Higgins Clark. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down! A definate recommendation for mystery and suspense fans.
1,BUYER BEWARE - NO NOTES OR DOCUMENTATION,"If you expect any notes or historical documentation that these recordings are authentic, forget it. To say that this is a shoddy a piece of merchandise is an understatement. This is the kind of CD that gives Public Domain a bad name."
1,none,"Seems like you have the wrong item in the wrong bin in the warehouse. I ordered ""America, Why I love Her"" by John Wayne and I got ""Sting"". You might want to check for yourself and see what you come up with when you order, ""America, Why I love Her"" by John Wayne. You'll come up with ""Sting"". Fix It!! and send me the right one."
2,A Disappointment,"I am a big fan of Sting and usually enjoy it when re re-fashions his songs so that they present new styles and dimensions. But this album was a disappointment. His re-working of Fragile, for instance, makes it so light as to float into insignificance. Many of the other songs are similarly inferior to their previous versions. The whole album has a feel of a lack of energy, like he woke up one day and figured he would fool around with his songs rather than putting the time and energy into crafting appealing alternative versions."
3,some hot....some not,"My main problem was walking into this without knowing that Sting was 'doing jazz'. Ignorance is bliss. I saw him perform ""Fragile"" on the Tribute for Heroes show and loved it. Dashed out and got this CD asap. Love that song. But that's it. I am NOT a jazz fan. Most of these songs seem like an awkward fusion of gospel, jazz and whatever. Maybe I'm still too invested in Police versions....maybe I'm too old to be flexible. Bottom line is that there are only 2 songs I really liked here: Fragile and Every Breath You Take. Oh well."
1,HYPE,"I grew up right with Screw. I was there from the beginning. I have over 50 of his grey tapes. This CD is a disgrace. It's like someone is trying to get rich off of Screw's name with this poor quality CD. There are some hits on the CD, but most are hits that most real Screw fans would already have on a grey tape or another CD. I would not recommend this CD."
2,"Too much rock, not enough folk","The title of my review sums up my opinion of this CD. I am a folk music fan. ""Bedlam Born"" is Steeleye kicking out the jams. As an agressive non-rock fan, I am unqualified to assess how good or bad the rock is. The CD has none of the beauty orhumor that other Steeleye Span recordings have.All respect to Gay Woods, but Steeleye Span without Maddie Prior, the 17th century Gracie Slick, is not Steeleye Span."
2,Hit a brick wall,"The first chapters are wasted on basic servlet and JSP coverage...if you are not familiar with them already, it is certainly not enough to get you up to speed, and if you already know the basics, you will just skip over them anyway.The promised ""downloadable"" example code and instructions to install them are not available. You get plain text files with several files cut and pasted into them all at once, with no instructions at all. And the suthor's site, (...), has no content on it whatsoever.I would wait and check back for the example code with instructions on Newriders.com and the author's site before buying this book...the examples import packages that you will not have on your system already.It is hard to give it a fair review without the resources, because it is not possible to proceed past the first chapter without them."
2,"DVD is NOT a brain training program, it's an infomercial for one.","I donated to PBS and got the set of Brain Training items. This dvd is just the PBS program all over again. It is NOT a brain training program with exercises you can do, etc. It's talking heads plugging how great their program is. It's marginally interesting on first viewing but I can't see wanting to watch it again. Just watch it on PBS and save your money.The actual brain program this dvd touts is very expensive and available on the website. It came w/ my donation and it's very well made, but is truly boring, as the other reviewer stated, I dread doing it (and in fact, haven't in a week or more). It's focus is auditory not visual which is ok but it'd be better if it had both. I haven't done it enough to give a thorough review of it or it's benefits."
2,Mistake,Thought this would be some exercises and things to do to improve the brain. It says Brain fitness Program. It turned out to be a copy of the PBS program and not a program for brain fitness. Hana
1,"Another ""extreme plasticiry"" scam!","Once again the science of the brain is being spinned and twisted in order for some one to make money out of it. I watched this entire thing on PBS. It's the same old trick, taking bits of scientific facts about how the brain works and completly infering all the wrong conclusions. ""plasticity"" (the ability of the brain to learn) is nothing new! Anybody who can remember what they had for lunch can understand this since that expericence had to leave some phyiscial trace in the brain in order to remember it. Explaining the phyiscal process behind this ability to learn, and then pretend like this is all some new scientific discoveries about how the brain is mallable in any shape or form is extremly deceiving and quite sleazy. My advice is to stay away from this dogma based nonsense.. save your money!"
4,The Brain Fitness Program,This video is helpful for individuals that have had a stroke. It gives them new hope for recovery.
1,Whoa! Too much perfume!!,"The frangrance in this stuff is overwhelming. It smeels like someone dumped a bottle of a Polo knock-off in it. The shampoo is fine, lathers nicely, rinses clean, but that smell is unbearable. I had to toss it."
4,Aqua dry towel,"I purchased two of these for a raft trip in the Grand Canyon. They are as described; soft, light weight, compact and very efficient at drying off wet bodies, hands and hair. Size is as described. The only negative comment is they take a long time to dry themselves. The material is highly absorbant but seems to retain the moisture more so than other materials.This trip was damp with a lot of monsoonal rain so drying conditions were not optimal. Sometimes the towel, notdrying overnight, had to go into the wet storage area of the camp bags. No problems, no odor or mold, just wet to damp towels at the next camp. I will keep these and try under drier conditions. I like them, other than the length of time to dry out."
2,Not great,Not a great product. There are better towels out there. Not very absorbent and the size is not very practical. It also feels weird on my skin.
2,No Index = Bad review!,"This book can be very helpful, but with no Index, it is quicker to do a Google search to find the information you need. The book has 25 blank pages in the back of the book, almost like they forgot to include the Index."
4,nice and comfortable,These ear plugs are very nice and comfortable. Not very great but good worth for the price. You've to twist them a bit to fit properly. Best part is they stop the water properly and no water goes inside the ears.
3,didn't work for me,"Nothing wrong with the quality of these, they just didn't remotely fit in my ears. Not even close. I have a pretty small head, so I guess maybe narrow ear canals (I'd never really thought about it until I started shopping for earplugs!) I have had a difficult time finding anything that will work for me to keep water out while swimming laps. So far, Mack's Aqua Block & Barracuda are okay, not perfect. I'm going to try a few more, but unfortunately, Aqua Sphere's did not work for me."
2,Not good for sleep: they hurt,"I bought a pair of this ear plugs from Amazon. I didn't use them for swimming, but for sleep. After wear them for 10 to 20 minutes I have to take them off because they hurt in my ear channels. I tried them a lot of times, with the same result: I couldn't sleep with them in my ears. They seem very well designed, but maybe they must be used for what they were made for: swimming."
2,they run very large,"when looking at earphones, I use medium on every set I've ever owned making me think I have a medium sized ear. That being said, these things seem to run Large! I am able to get them to stay in my ears for the most part but it's very difficult.On the plus side, they float and are easy to sport floating on top of the water."
4,Good,"Good earplugs for price, needs a better case to maintain and add to the existing swimming gear, otherwise could get lost."
1,Nikon Coolpix 2500 minisync retractable charge cable,"I received the minisync retractable charge cable, when I tried to use it, it would not fit my camera. I have a Nikon Coolpix 2500. According to the Ad, it is suppose to fit that camera. I returned it to the company, as yet No refund."
3,"Entertaining to read, short for real insight","This is a good book for the reader who wants to read about some real life crime stories and how they are solved.Also a useful read for someone looking for a good real crime story, to buy ANOTHER book to read further about it.Personally I found this book entertaining and read it with interest, because i mostly get bored with a crime story that covers a whole book, that goes on and on about what the neighbor' s wife told the police about what her husband told her that he saw and all the not-so-useful-facts.Beware though that the story for each crime is real short, it mostly covers the forensics point of view of how a crime was solved."
4,Muddy's Delta Blues,"Most Blues fans have heard a lot of chicago blues. Most fans have a lot of Muddy Waters chicago blues. But not alot of Muddy Waters fans would have heard Muddy sing the delta blues. This CD is very intersting because it shows Muddy playing the first blues he ever heard, The Delta Blues. Much like the sounds of Son House, Robert Johnson and Skip JAmes this cd is all acoustic blues. It is great to be able to hear a very young Muddy sing delta blues because once he went to Chicago he abandoned the delta sound and went electric. Muddy does several Robert Johnson songs on this cd quite well, and there are some interesting interviews with Muddy explaining what life was like in the delta and why he made songs out of his experiences. For those who like the old delta blues this cd is a must have, on no other cd do we hear Muddy singing blues like these."
3,Aspects Nectar Bar,"Good, basic product. However, because of construction design, the ""C"" shaped plastic body which encompasses the ""roof"", back and base (the nectar tray sits in it and is removable) bends quite a bit in the warm weather. I had to insert shims in the front of the nectar tray to try and level it, but it still sags. Also, the leveling pegs on the back don't protrude equidistant to the depth of the suction cup, so I had to modify that to prevent it from being even more off-level. The more off-level it is, the harder it is for the hummingbirds to reach down to the nectar.The good news is, Aspects says it's no longer available, and is being replaced with a better, more sturdily designed model, which should be available by now. It will also include the NectarGuards, (that work quite effectively) which this model doesn't."
2,Zone 7 for Hawaii never would have worked,"We just moved to Hawaii and found the clock had changed for DST on, of course, the old date. Well there IS no DST in Hawaii - so even with the OLD DST dates, this clock radio would have changed the time on us. I do like the big numbers, though. But I'm getting a new clock."
2,Don't trust Emerson,"Ever since I sold electronics in the late 80's, I always abided by the adage ""Don't trust Emerson."" There's a reason their products are so CHEAP, people!I bought this clock radio and loved it. The two alarms, the 7-5-2 setting, the automatic time setting...good stuff.HOWEVER, the LCD went out (parts of it) within a few months of getting it. I can safely say I will not allow another Emerson product in my house again. Now I have to buy another one. You don't save money in the end.Avoid this product."
2,No closed captioning,"I loved this show and was so happy to finally find it out on DVD. There is a fly in ointment as us old timers say NO CC or SUBTITLES. Since my hearing is no longer good, I will have to sell my set. In this day and age there is no reason that all shows don't come with CC. Show 5+ stars DVD 2 stars for no CC"
3,Definitely Action packed!,"I like the show,as I did when I use to watch it when it originally aired.It has a terrifc cast,who all interact with each other very well.Great storylines and always some crazy monsters or something else around the corner. I guarantee any little kids would be glued to the tv set watching this,HOWEVER if I am to be totally honest? There is a certain level of cheesiness that I must admit gets a little lame at some times. Lots of action and fighting scene,but done in a very silly manner and unrealistic. if I am to give examples of other shows like that I would the Zena,Hercules,Sinbad series ect. if you are ok with the style of those shows than you will love this.And it is a fun show!"
2,From the early 90s?,"This DVD is extremely outdated. I wasn't expecting it to be an almost live interview simulation or anything really spectacular and yet, it was still disappointing. It didn't operate properly on my MAC but worked fine on my PC. I think if you're looking for something where you're able to hear interview questions (so you can get used to the language) and don't want to go through the trouble of looking them up on youtube, then this dvd might be beneficial. Otherwise, I'd look skip it."
4,Dust Bag,The sander works well with the exception of the the dust bag. No matter where you direct it it is always in the way. I knew this about the dust bag when I bought the sander. It isn't something that would stop me from purchasing the same sander again.
3,Marin for small dogs,"My yorkie was diagnosed with mild/moderate liver shunt after developing pancreatitis a year ago. After a lot of research, we decided to try diet and Marin before more invasive, risky and expensive treatment. I began making her food from all natural/organic chicken, beef and fruit and vegetables. I also give her 1/4 of a Marin tablet. I can't say that the Marin is the only reason she is doing so well. But today her symptoms are nearly gone. Her recent vet check up showed she is healthy and needs no further treatment or testing at this time. We plan to keep her on this diet and the Marin forever."
5,awesome collection,excellent collection ......personally i bought it for 12 months of the year and mama loocie since im a huge marvin gaye fan.
1,"talk only,few music","This evening is an interviewing evening.Talk, talk, talk.Words,words,words.Only a few music performances.No clips.I read Quincy's bio book(trancelated in japanese), and that's enough about him.DVD could show us more visualy about the man."
3,"Good idea, poor implementation","Actually, I was pretty impressed when I saw the contents of the book - it looked like it covers lots of practical programming aspects, in addition to the algorithms basics & advanced topics. But I was pretty disappointed - the book is almost unreadable and the code it pretty poor (I'm not a C++ guru myself, but it looks like the code in the book was written by the C++ amateur - I've had that 'wtf' feeling pretty often).However, the book is not a complete disaster. It has pretty nice exercises as well as giving pretty complete list of topics that you can 'google' (or find somewhere else) then.Fortunately, I've borrowed that book from the university library - I would never spend 71$ for that."
4,"not quite, but close","Now that I have the CD, I find it's NOT an exact reissue of the LP. I know this album note by note and some things have been edited. Not the least of which is: Where's the caterwauling at the beginning of Tom Cat? And ""My Girl"" at the end of ""She's Alright""? Overall a great flashback though."
2,Strangling Cats.,"Would I have to shoot myself if I bought this?I gave it two stars because I love Muddy Waters.Otherwise, it gets zero stars."
2,Used to be alright.,"I bought this on vinyl when it first came out and back then I thought is was just fantastic. However, I now give it a poor review, because since this album's release there have been countless productions so much better that there is no reason to ever listen to this cd again. Not to mention their sound is commercial sounding and cheesy at some points. I am a goa dj who has been collecting records from around the world for about 4 years and I think this album is placed at the very bottom of a stack records somewhere. I love goa music and am always willing to turn people on to the underground beat. Email me at djarchetype21@hotmail.com for a free demo cd."
3,Robert Rogers: Roger's Rangers & the French & Indian War,I found the writing & Illustrations entertaining and informative though I didn't realize the book was for a youth or younger reader.
3,Silly fun!,About 8 years ago one lonely Saturday night I was bed ridden with the flu. As I was surfing the cable channels that night I surfed right into the Turner network channel. There they were airing four sci-fi fun gems.Two of those were The Creature With The Atom Brain and The Werewolf. I was in 1950 Sci-fi heaven. Finally they are on DVD. If you are looking for some big serious production out of these films then you'll need to pass. However if you are looking for good cheap fun then grab some popcorn and turn off the lights.
3,More 3 1/2 stars than 3; good for summer,"Martel's novel raises some interesting philosophical and religious questions, but they're more likely to get the gray matter working a little than to get you reflecting on the deepest mysteries of the universe. The style is serviceable but shines in a couple places, the story is top-notch, and it will get you thinking. This is the kind of novel I'd suggest for summer reading."
4,Piece of pi,"While the book took its time to to get into the nitty gritty of Yann Martel's wonderful storytelling it was well worth it..enjoyed the bizarrely surreal, yet completely believable adventure of Pi and Richard Parker..think jungle book crossed with Tom Hanks' castaway.."
4,A good read,This was a bright adventure. A rich and affirming story that lifts you up. Something good for when one is a little down.
2,left with nothing,"I couldn't put this book down. This guy can write. But, coming to the end, I was left with nothing. No epiphany of any kind. No emotional or intellectual satisfaction. Just a sense of wasted time."
5,incredible,"life of pi is such a wonderful story. if you want a book that you'll never forget this is the book you want. i still cannot stop thinking about it and i finished it a week ago. halfway through the book it got really slow but don't get discouraged. read it, finish it. the ending is everything."
5,Very Intelligent...,"This is a very intelligent book. It asks all the right questions and provides glimpses of various answers but leaves it to the reader to make his/her own conclusions (if there are any).Most areas of the book are preposterous but it only adds to the experience and highlight the futility of the human condition. I can't wait to read this book again!Usually, the only books I read in one sitting are trash novels but this was a pleasant exception. I could not put this down once I started reading it. Buy and read this again and again...."
4,A journey from Innocence to Experience,"Yann Martel takes the reader on a journey from innocence to experience symbolised by William Blake's ""The Little Black Boy"" from Songs of Innocence and ""Tyger"" from Songs of Experience."
2,should have been a short story,"Wow... did I hate this book. the first half of the book was terrible. It felt like the author wrote the first half only so it would be long enough to qualify as a novel.I rated it as a 2, only because the second half was was ok.if you really want to read it, buy this one used."
2,Reader from Houston,"In the Pacific ocean of praise for this book, I have to sound a critical note. As many others, I was ready to love this book after all the hype surrounding the Booker win. Alas....the book is too self conscious to be engaging, too puffed up to be sincere, too melodramatic to trust. It could appeal to many adventure seeking readers of young age ( minus the mushy spirituality) but it is too winded to hold restless young minds. For this adult reader, the major mood after reading it in one seating was - "" this could be written by senile Salman Rushdie who tries to win the Hollywood crowd"". It lacks subtlety, wisdom, grace, strangeness of really great work of literature. As for the endless spiritual cliches...only feeble minded can find any divinity in them."
4,Decent,I picked up this book becaues friends have been recommending it to me for quite some time. It is a funny read with some interesting parts. I liked the tiger the best. Overall a decent read.
4,A great adventure,"I enjoyed this outside of the box adventure. I appreciated learning some zoology and biology. I think it is also a good exercise for the reader to imagine being alone in a boat in the middle of the Pacific - enough time and space to be alone with your own thoughts and what that would be like to explore your mind for once without distraction (until you starve, that is). The character Pi is completely loveable. I could relate to the theme of dynamic resilience - stretching oneself over and over again to meet the never ending challenges."
3,Disappointed...,"I had read so much praises about this book that I was expecting something brilliant. The beginning contains a lot of humour, but is overall very slow. I would say that the book is divided into two parts: Before the ship accident, when Pi is in India, and after. I was very disappointed, because I saw no connection between these two parts, especially after having fought through the first part. There is no mention of religion anymore in the second part, so I didn't understand why it was such a big thing at the beginning. I agree on the fact that this book is original and unique, but in the end, I was disappointed. Maybe I am not the reader to enjoy this new sort of book! I would still suggest to try it."
3,"Not Bad, but not one of my Favorites","This was an interesting book about a boy who is ship wrecked on a life boat with several zoo animals. The last to survive are Pi (the boy) and a tiger. It is interesting how Pi learns to survive and to keep the tiger from eatting him, but after awhile, floating on a boat does not leave for the most exciting read. It is worth reading, but do not expect an ""keep you on the edge of your seat"" or ""touch the heart"" kind of book."
2,Life of Pi,"Confusing, dark and way too discriptive. I enjoy an author who develops an idea to help the reader view the story accurately but I do not need 10 descriptions of the sky, or the ocean or any other part of the book. I found myself skimming parts because they were unnecessary. The only reason I finished it was because of a book club and I resold it immediately. I would not recommend it."
5,A Positively Brilliant Book,"Reading this book became more than the simple act of reading. As with truly intelligent writing, for days after the last page was turned, I was left thinking of the magnitude of this tale and all that it implied. When I first heard of the premise, I wondered how it would possibly work, but then, sea voyages are nothing new to literature. Moby Dick, The Old Man and The Sea, and of course Kon Tiki all took place over long periods at sea. Life of Pi contains elements of those aforementioned master works, but maintains its own special dignity by adding spiritual lessons to this unique genre.There are many in the world today who could learn from the intelligent look at the innocence of a child who becomes entranced with the Muslim faith, Christianity, and Hinduism. It is through the varied faiths that he has that Pi is able to survive his ordeal.This book is simply astonishing and I recommend it highly."
2,Let-down,"Powerful story, cowardly ending. The author spends the first 400 pages weaving a story about the nobility of creation and man's relationship with it, then ends the book by saying ""never mind""."
2,:(,I had been seeing the trailer for the movie and I really wanted to read the book. But I was really disappointed with the way that the father teaches the children the importance of never turning your back on a wild animal. To respect the wild animals. I won't give away too much about the book....but being a lover of animals I couldn't finish the book.
5,Lisa review,"Very interesting book. As is almost always the case, there is much more in the book than the movie adaptation. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,Life of Pi,"A well written, and entertaining account, even if somewhat bizarre in places. Definitely a book to read before seeing the film"
5,Inspiring,To me this book represents the quest of the human being for the presence of God not only in himself but in all other beings. The oneness of I and God.In it we see and experience the mastery of manWhen he sees himself as being the individualization of God. How he masters the elements and finallyConquers himself and his environment.
3,First person boring,"Can't really put my finger on it, but had a hard time wading through this book. I thought there would be more inneraction with the tiger, and Pi simply didn't get my affection."
4,Ummm,This has been one of the most gruesome tedious exhausting fascinating bewildering pieces of pure artistry I have ever read. Much thanks...I think.
4,Life of Pi.,Life of Pi. Intriguing story. A little too much narrative at times. A good read looking forward to the movie.
1,I did not care for this type of story at all.,I did not think this book was very entertaining. I did not expect it to be so gory and shocking. I ordered it because I heard of the movie and have ordered others made into movies and enjoyed them
4,Life of Pi,"I loved this book, although it was slow to begin and toward the end it rambled a bit. Can't wait to see the movie."
2,Not that great,"With all of the hype around this book, I had high expectations which were not met. It was a relatively slow read, which picked up here and there. It had some interesting parts, and kind of a cool ending/twist. However, I expected it to be more inspiring and more reflective and more compelling to read."
2,First Book,"This was my first book on Kindle and it wasn't what I expected. Knowing that it had already been made into a movie, I just couldn't imagine them bringing it to life as some parts were gross"
3,Boring in its sameness,Boring and really to dull to be fun reading. I think that its a good book for early teens and some what younger kids.
3,Nightmares,The story itself was quite extreme. There was a lot of unexpected descriptive death. I recommend this book the non animal lover. I felt sorry for every animal that died or was killed. This will be the cause of my nightmares.
2,Not so great,"Don't be dragged in by all the hype. This story and book is just OK. Its pretty unbelievable too, but to each his own, personally I just didn't care for it. I'll give you a list of book worth reading.The Accidental Tourist - Anne Tyler - just plain cleverGhostmap -- Don't let the title fool you, its about the cholera epidemic in 1800's England. This was real medical detective work.The Trail - M L Dunn. Best Western Novel to come along in years. Top notch dialogue and action"
5,Spiritual Journey,This book was amazing. I read it for book club. It was spiritual and eye opening about human nature and our close-mindedness to labels and preconceived notions!! The story is a big slow going but if you can read between the lines you'll come out with more perspective than most people!! LOVE IT!!
1,Waste of time,This book was the worst crap I've ever read. Time in my life I'll never get back? Some say spiritual---I say just BAD
1,Terrible book,"I heard the movie was coming out, and as books are normally better than movies, I decided to read it first. After reading through it 1. I will not watch the movie 2. I regret wasting my time reading the book in the first place.The book is not very well written, and gives the feeling that it was just randomly thrown together. My largest issue is that early in the book it says ""it's a story that will make you believe in God"". This sets the bar high, and after spending a decent amount of time writing about the different religions and how Pi learns about them, the second half of the book makes few references to god again and just continues to blather randomly on.The book was highly disappointing. Save your time, don't read the book."
1,Not worth the time-I wish I could get the Hours Back I invested!,"I did give this book one star, only because I found one or two pearls of wisdom! Other than that it was a waste of time and money. I should have followed my instints early on and stop reading it about 40 pages in or sooner, but I almost always finish all books I start-just a habit that I may need to break after this waste of time!"
4,Fun Read,"This was a fun book. I was attracted to it because it was about a boy shipwrecked with a tiger, which I thought was an interesting premise, but my favorite part of the story was actually the first part, which told of the boy's upbringing in India. The lifeboat part was cool too, but to me, the ending was fuzzy and not very satisfying, which is why I gave it the 4 stars instead of five. Doubtless it was ended this way on purpose, but I would've liked a better closure. However, getting to the end of the book was enjoyable!"
1,Terrible,"I am an avid reader and have read some books that were difficult to get through. Nevertheless, I did so and with little effort. I give the book a chance till the very end. The Life of Pi was the hardest book that I have ever forced myself to read. Absolute mind numbing torture."
1,slow start/disturbing ending,"I was interested in the movie and wanted to read the book before I went to see the movie.It was a V-E-R-Y slow start. I actually love philosophy,but this did not feel like a real person's experience.It is written in the first person but switches between 2 different first person voices which means you must pay very close attention.The ending is very disturbing. I certainly won't go see the movie, and would not recommend the book to anyone."
5,Unlike Anything I've Ever Read,"Yann Martel's Booker Prize winning novel is an amazing work. Told with the lightest of touches, the beauty, humour and sheer savagery of Pi's world will stay with you for a long time. It has been months since I finished the novel, and I can't get it out of my mind. Other books read since pale by comparison. Some of Pi's adventures in the lifeboat with Richard Parker (the Bengal Tiger) are harrowing, but it is the final chapters that are truly stunning. The final sentence left me with tears in my eyes. This may well be the best book that I have ever read -it's certainly the best I've read in the past few years."
2,"good writing, boring story","I heard great things about this novel, but I found it boring.The first 100 pages are set-up about Pi's life before the shipwreck. These are interesting and unique, a boy so in love with God that he joins 3 religions. But ultimately, this has little to do with the real story of the shipwreck.The next 200 pages are a boy stuck on a small boat with a tiger. Interesting concept, but nothing happens. It's about a 100 pages too long. I ended up skimming over most of it without missing anything.Martel should have cut out about half of the boat travels and interspersed the intro materials with the shipwrecked period as flashbacks to break up the monotony of the middle of the book, and tied his love of multiple religions better into the rest of the story."
3,"It's good, but not that good.","Everybody else here seems to have enjoyed this book much more than I did. I thought the story was good, and his writing style is captivating, but it's a very simple story and doesn't actually take too much reader involvement. This is the kind of book you can put down for a few weeks and pick up right where you left off without actually missing it. There are many better shipwreck stories than this one, and the ending was just kind of blah. I don't recommend it for anything more than a beach read."
2,Terribly Disappointing,"After reading such great reviews of ""The Life of Pi,"" I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. It was a huge disappointment. The first one hundred pages were slow and painful. After completing the book, I was bummed to find the whole story a hoax. I think this author is very overrated, and would recommend ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,"" if you are interested in an excellent, fresh new author."
4,Enjoyable and Refreshing,"Perhaps what I liked most about this book is the fresh and unique story it told. Person lost at sea, what's so unique about that? Not much, but what is unique is the way the character deals with his dilemma, as well as his unlikely companions. The psychological twist at the end will have you introspectively engaged long after you finish the novel. I don't often read novels twice, but I picked this one up again just to make sure I didn't miss anything. Delightful, and quite sharable, you'll want to pass it along when you're finished."
2,Solid story and writing throughout...UNTIL THE ENDING,"Honestly, the first 350 pages of this book are excellent. I thought the author did a great job of illuminating the main character of Pi. You care about him, you empathize with him, and you want him to triumph over his dire circumstances. I stuck with this book (As a disclaimer, I'm usually a fan of well-written nonfiction, so I tend to be more critical of fiction books) for these reasons. HOWEVER, you must understand that the ending is completely disjointed, unexpected, and downright disappointing. I honestly felt that it invalidated the initial beauty and drama of the story. Sure, you can have some philosophical discussions about magical realism, the value of storytelling, and moral relativism, but what's the point? The ending was unsettling, both for its darkness as well as its disappointment. Just be prepared for that if you decide to go on this 400-page journey with Pi."
4,What an amazing story,I wasn't sure what to expect when the story began to unfold. This was an incredidbly vivid journey and I loved nearly every minute of it. The reason for only four stars- I still don't know what to make of the ending. Which version of the story do I want to be true? I may have to read it again to decide.
4,"Charming, inspiring story with great humor","A charming, observant and humorous story of an Indian boy who grew up in a zoo, later survive a shipwreck and even later survive being trapped on a lifeboat at sea, with a tiger, a hyena and an orang utan onboard. How a mere boy could possibly survive in such a situation perhaps might seem unbelievable. However, the author has managed to present a very plausible and ingenious case of how this could actually happen in real life -- with numerous little nuggets of information on how animals behave (and could be manipulated to behave) under certain circumstances.At certain points, however, the narrative (though humorous and observant) could get a little tedious. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it much more if the story were a little shorter or the writing more concise."
5,Life of PI,Grreat story! Recommend to anyone who is in for adventure. Haven't seen the movie although they say it is good too!
2,Life of Pi,I saw the movie and loved it and was anxious to read the book thinking that it would be educational. I was very upset to read all the blood and gore. It really turned me off.
2,Not sure it was worth the effort,"I found this book difficult to get through and could only read it in short bursts. The end twist was unexpected and in some ways a bit of a let down. The main character's self talk and descriptions were consistent but I certainly won't read it again. While not saying it was unpleasant, I couldn't really recommend it to anyone wishing to have a relaxing easy read."
2,Ok book,I had a hard time getting into this book. the ending was interesting but the first half of the book was slow for me and a little gruesome.
2,What is the big fuss about this book?,"I ordered this book with ""The Hours"" (Michael Cunningham), thinking, wow, what a great week this is going to be... Well folks, borrow this book at your local library, read the first third of the book (animals and theology stuff is great) but keep some time to do better things than reading the rest of it. The middle is boring and the end is like: ""where's the beef? You must be joking, etc."" It's is certainly a no go for his previous or next books for me. Sorry, Yan..."
3,Good storytelling,"It's a fun book, telling an imaginative adventure story. Perhaps winning the booker prize raised expectations a little beyond what is fair. Approach it with the right mindset, and I think you'll like it. If you expect it to trigger some deep, contemplative musings, you'll be disappointed."
4,interesting read,One of the most interesting books I have read in a long time.My daughter is reading this as part of their 10th grade summer reading.
5,Loved it!!!!!,"What an excellent story book, up there with the best of them. I loved the writing, the imagination, the adventure, the sadness, the excitement,the happiness and whilst reading wondering what will happen next!!!I just could not put this book down and found myself alone in the lounge reading with the voice in my head saying - only one more page......."
4,Let's hope the movie lives up to the book,"I would've given it 5 stars but i felt the bit where Pi lands on the island was a little far fetched. And I am sure the movie will not be as in depth as the book. ( They never are)I would recommend it to a few friends who would find this book very fascinating and adventurous.My understanding from previews I saw on TV is that the only stow away besides Pi on the boat is the Bengel TIger, surprisingly not according to the book.Mercedes"
3,A great start that slips...,"I really enjoyed the opening chapters of the book. They are very evocative of India and a bright and vibrant world. There are many questions posed and explored and I was thoroughly engaged.The problem for me came as the plot developed and the family move from India. From that point on I became rather switched off, I'm afraid, and my energy and enthusiasm for the book declined.There's a wonderful ending (10 out of 10) that made the slog worthwhile, but I did think it was a book of 2 very different halves."
3,Too much fish,"I realize that survival is a personal journey that brings one closer to God as your life stands on the brink of ending; but in the Life of Pi, the story gets bogged down in the many ways of eating raw fish and sea turtles. There is a constant struggle between the human, Pi, and other species to survive, with one predator eating another. After a while, you care little for the story."
4,Adventure beckons,Life of Pi was a very enthralling story that kept me hungry for the next part of the story to be revealed to me. When it was I was not let down but re-energized to keep on reading. I would recommend this to friends and strangers alike.
1,Awful,This is the worst book I have ever read! It was pointless until the last chapter. I was bored and wanted to throw the book away. Too much detail. One of the worst authors out there. Don't read if possible!
1,Disturbing and Dissapointing.,"I have to say, I'm glad I finished the book. Because, This book is a very gory book. It was sickening, disturbing, and I can't believe it was in my school library. It describes all the details of an inside of an animal, (when the zebra is killed), and not only that, It has a bit too much dialogue.This book is about a hindu boy who is shipwrecked somewhere along Boreno. He later on befriends a 450- pound tiger, and later on the tiger becomes gung-ho on other animals on the island. Unfourtanatly, I was dissapointed because of the ""reccomended age"" level is 10-16. MORE LIKE 14-23! anyways, good book, but FIZZLING QUICKLY!"
5,listening to audio,The eleven and one half hour audio is brilliant. Read by Jeff Woodman could not be better. This amazing story had me under it's spell.It left me wanting to know more about the author Yann Martel and how his brain could conjure up such an imaginative tell.If only Pi had such a book for his nine month ordeal as a castaway. It's one that he would have loved to read over and over.
2,No Take-Away Wisdom... Nothing To Do With God As Promised,"I have read the Life of Pi and found it quite the fantasy. (SPOILER ALERT) If you read to the end you will see that Pi admits to making it all up so he wouldn't have to confront what horribleness really occurred. A sad tale with really no take-away wisdom. The inside cover of the book makes the insane claim that this book may make you believe in God. There is nothing in the book that would substantiate that ludicrous statement. The book is well written and if you are interested in the difference between the two and three toed sloth, you will enjoy the first half. If you like fantasy, you will like the second half."
3,It's okay....,"Do yourself a favor and skip the first 100 pages. They add nothing to the book. It's only at around pg 102 that things get tolerable. On occasion, the book turns preachy, and the author frequently falls into ""telling the story"" rather than ""showing it"". (Telling me that this book is miraculous and will make me believe in God just doesn't cut it. I'm still an agnostic.) Also, the author frequently runs into entire chapters where he starts sentences with the same word, over and over. You'd think he'd add some variety, but I guess it's avante-garde to start each sentence with the word ""I"" or ""He"" and then go on and on in the smallest minutiae possible about a certain event. Just say you what you did and move on! Grrrr! On the whole, I put it somewhere slightly above stephen king and somewhere very far below Hemmingway. I give it 3 stars for effort."
4,Good reading,"I got this audiobook CD from the library. The first couple hours of the book are devoted to philosophical musings and odd insertions of observations from another writer from another time and place. The description of southern Indian life is interesting. The details of life at sea are very believeable and amazing in their detail. The book becomes confusing in the closing hour or so, where they land on some magical island. Other than that, the book is very believable and interesting."
4,Life of Pi,A friend lent me her copy to read. She was telling me this was a great read that her Book Club had read. When I read this book ten years ago.... I remembered it being pretty boring and hard to follow. I did not finish it. Well I decided to give it another try as there is a movie coming out so I gave it another try.... I stuck it out and was glad that I did the second time. The story actually was not that bad but pretty good! So if you find it is really boring in the beginning... hang in there!
5,* Great read *,I loved how the author was able to write about little tiny indian jokes that one wouldn't understand unless one was from south east asia. I had a tough time putting this book down because it was funny and painful at the sametime.I defintely recommended this book.
5,Loved It,"This was such a great read once you got past the 1st 2 chapters, I am going to believe the first story, so well written I am looking forward to seeing the movie to see how they could possible capture this on screen..My imagination worked over time Loved It."
3,Only Half worth the read,Well the first part of this book was extremely horrible and hard to muddle through ! However the second part of the book (the actually adventure) I really enjoyed I would not recommend the first part to anyone .
2,different,I enjoyed the book although had to skip over some parts that were too gorry for me. I'm recomending it to others cautiously.
3,One of the unimpressed,"After casting around for some summer reading I grabbed this one and another from the best selling list, assuming the great mass of numbers buying it up meant something. Unfortunately it meant very little :(Without going into a synopsis of the plot (see above for that) my feelings are the book was just *barely* worth the $9 and given the choice I'd rather get it from the library. Teased with reviews saying it would change my life or make me believe in God it only managed to provide a day and a half of well turned phrases. While occasionally quirky and clever I found the beginning slow and pedantic.Perhaps the symbolism -- obscure at times -- was crystal clear to those who rave about this book and they connected all the dots in their own heads. But for me...well I guess I still have to wait on Harry Potter"
1,I Don't Get It,I heard from everywhere and everyone how wonderful this book was and how I had to read it so I did. Or at least I tried to. I stuck it out about 2/3 of the way before giving up on it (which I don't usually do!). I just couldn't keep waiting for something to happen.
4,Like a fairytale you need to suspend belief - or not,"Like a fairytale you need to suspend belief - or not. What story do I chose? Would I prefer life in a boat with or without a companion? This book is one you think about more after you finish than when you read it. Did I waste hours on reading a tale that is unbelievable, or did I spend hours on a tale that was believable? I still don't know."
4,I enjoyed it!,"I don't usually write reviews for anything but I liked this book a lot. I wanted to see the movie even though I didn't really know what it was about, just because I liked the previews. But someone recommended the book to me so I thought I would give it a shot. Truthfully, I didn't have very high expectations, after all how many new adventures can you have floating around in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean day after day. But I was pleasantly surprised. I couldn't get it out of my mind for days afterwards. The ending especially."
5,Without looking back,"There are so many images in my mind after reading this book. The collection of animals, and bugs, on the lifeboat;the last glimpse of Richard Parker;the mysterious island-what visual magic Yann Martel writes!I loved the exploration of what the point of religion is in the end, no matter what form it takes.I loved the questions raised on many levels.I highly recommend this book. Savor and enjoy."
5,Very Good,"A great book to read for all ages, different and a change of pace from other story lines. highly recommended"
2,Okay-,"Although it was an okay novel, I feel there could have been much more done with the book. The details are immense and I found it difficult to focus and read most of the time. The time spent on certain details would leave the reader to believe that they would come full-circle at the end of the book; however, at the end, I was rather disappointed."
3,Entertaining,"It's entertaining and an easy read, but I didn't like the way it ended. I'm curious to see if the movie ends the same way."
3,Illustrated edition good; story so-so,"The Illustrated edition was a good deal; the illustrations were quite good impressions of the content. The narrative itself in the early part had too much religious philosophy -- although the basic idea of mixing Hinduism, Judaism, and Christianity was worthwhile. After pressing on, several sections were needlessly gross. In the final part with the island, I was just not able to suspend disbelief (even taking it as allegory or hallucination). Maybe the movie will be better."
5,Life of Pi,It is a good book and it takes you through some many adventures that you dont want to put it down i highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to visual the settings it has a whole bunch of detail that makes you feel like you are in the book
2,I love animals...,"I read this book with my book club. I probably wouldn't have chosen it otherwise based on the brief descriptions I had read. The chapters were very short, which I one of the reasons I made it through to the end. There were several times, during the first 70% of the book, that I had to skip a couple pages. I am not known for doing this; the detailed descriptions were just too much. On the other hand , I began to think those select parts were well written if I could visualize so easily. That being said, I barely made it through and I felt that it dragged at many times. I was reading fast, hoping to get the end quickly. I'm not so sure I would recommend this book to anyone."
3,Too Graphic,Too graphic detail...glad the movie didn't show what I read! Hesitant to see the movie because the killing of the zebra by the hyena was so graphic! But understand that the movie doesn't dwell on that part.
1,Whatever,"This book does not merit 20 words about it.The better story is that the novel Life Of Pi does not exist.Oh, damn. It's still here."
3,A nice read but there are leaps,"I enjoyed reading this book but did not enjoy the leap of faith that it wanted me to take in the end. Perhaps it is my own scepticism, but I don't ascribe to the idea that life is more fantastic and interesting if there is a God. That is not what I want to base my belief on. Again, it was a fun read, but not one that I got enough from that I would do it again."
3,Good Read; Odd Ending,"Martel paints his characters with humor and appeal and his settings are very visual. I found the book enjoyable, over all. However, I found it difficult to emotionally engage in places and was disappointed with some weak elements near its conclusion. In fact, I found the end pretty unsatisfying in its mechanics. From this reader's perspective, some seemingly important concepts laid out in the beginning, fell apart as the story progressed. The Author's Note claims, ""I have a story that will make you believe in God."" and there are some great ideas entertained with hilarity and joy along that vein. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, what started out as a charming call to choose to believe in GOD, any god, even all gods, became bogged down in the details of survival and the convention of a third party interview report. I would recommend Life of Pi... it just hasn't earned a permanent place on my bookshelf."
5,Beautifully illustrated!,This is a wonderful story. I decided to buy this edition because of the illustrations. The colors are brilliant and beautiful.
5,A wonderful book that no one should pass up!,"This is a great read for anyone. It's not tedious at all, but don't let the simplicity fool you. Along the same vein as other novels like ""Sophie's World,"" or ""The Alchemist,"" this book is inspiring and thought-provoking."
4,"A clever, brutal, beautiful and haunting story","Although the first chapters are rather slow and a little pedantic, from the moment you are on the lifeboat with Pi and the animals you will be gripped, spellbound and horrified.Pi's telling of his ordeal is unbelievably believable. At times it is so brutal you can't read on, at others it is so beautiful it will make you want to weep.This is a book to be read on more than one level and more than once. The last few pages will change your whole perspective on the story and you will be left wondering whether you have misunderstood Pi completely and whether you should go back and read the whole book again. This is where the Life of Pi is so very clever and so very chilling, revealing the dark side of human nature by comparing it to the instinctive nature of animals.This book makes Tom Hanks' Castaway look like a romantic comedy."
4,Have your Pi and eat it too,"Really, the only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was because the author claims in his preface that the tale he is about to tell will have you believing in God. Well, it's a good yarn, but not so moving that it has me embracing any religion. I did like its overall message however.Martel is a gifted storyteller. He hooks you with his opening words, and the remainder of the novel is simply him reeling you in. I often worry when I enjoy the first half of a novel because the second half rarely lives up to its predecessor and I find myself disgruntled with the author's vision. Not so with ""Life of Pi"". In fact, I possibly love the last 4 chapters more than any other part of the book.An engaging fairy tale for adults with a potent message.Note: If you have a weak stomach or are a hard core animal activist, some passages may be hard to handle. No overt cruelty, just some graphic descriptions of nature in action."
4,The unbelievable becomes plausible!,"Throw away the slow, pendantic personal essays of part 1 and skip straight to the real story where part 2 starts! The very idea of a boy stranded for 227 days in a lifeboat with a 450-pound tiger is objectively unreasonable, but you will find yourself believing it completely in short order! An old plot, with predictable issues and scenarios associated with survival on the open seas, but with twists you will never expect. This is a real page-turner once the story gets going."
4,Life of Pi,"- This is a good read, interesting story. I would recommend this book as a good short story. Loved the ending!!!"
4,Bizarre...,"A very unusual book, bizarre would be a good description of some parts, maybe I just didn't get it? Although it had me intrigued enough to finish it :o)"
5,Wow,"Very moving story, and a page turner.I raced through this just to see what happened next. I didn't want it to end."
5,Wow!,"This is one of those books when you finish reading, you realize you need to take a breath. The words I could use to describe how it made me feel, amazing, inspiring, imaginative, emotional, heroic, and more. There were so many wonderful moments in this book.... a couple times my throat clenched and the tears flowed. I laughed out loud. I cheered and I shouted for and against. It raised everything it could in me.And I am so glad this is not someones' real life story. That would be the utmost tragic thing to conceive. But for a story, this will be the one to beat for my favorite of the year. Man, I wish I read this sooner, but I've read it, and now can see the film. I hope it's half as good."
4,Disturbing yet good,"This book will ""live"" on your soul for days after you complete it. A little slow to get started but necessary for character development this allegory may leave you puzzled as well as troubled. However it opens topics that are great for dinner fable discussions. I am glad I read it."
2,Life of Pi,"Pretty far-fetched, and pretty boring. You are lead to think this is a true story at the beginning, but it's just the result of the authors's strange imagination."
3,PCS English Class,Life of Pi is a story about a boy and how he ended up in a life boat with a tiger. the story explains his journey through this unbelievable event. Will his past experiences help him survive this disaster?This story will have you question what is believable and what is not. it is a book that will make you wonder what will happen in the end.I must say that when reading Life of Pi keep an open mind. this is a good book; you will enjoy to read about this very interesting boy and his very interesting adventure.
2,Give me a break,"Maybe it's because I have a religious studies degree and have studied Indian history that I won't wax lyrically about this book. ""Life of PI"" didn't help me find God, quite the contrary, I found it had little to do with the mystery and magic of the otherworldly. What I did find was a writer who relished in describing how one animal rips apart another. Don't believe the people who tell you this is a kind of fable for the whole family. Unless you enjoy the Fight for Life kind of documentaries where animals hunt down another and then we get closeups of their rolling eyes and spurting blood, you'll best avoid this book with a body count.If you like stories about castaways, rent the Tom Hanks film. Don't get all starry eyed because a book is set in an exotic landscape and deals with ""foreign"" ideas. It had some interesting ideas but other than that was a real grisly waste of time."
5,A masterpiece!,"This is really an amazing story! Completely original in its plot and all the characters on it.... Its really 3 books into 1, the first part being very funny and adorable, the second part being the most amazing experience a human can have at sea... with a TIGER (no more explanation needed)! And then the end, where you are challenged to rethink the whole book, and its up to you in what you believe or want to believe in the end, and maybe that is the 'message' that lingers on after you've finished it.I remember when I watched the movie 12 monkeys, that in the end you start 'reviewing' the whole movie because you understand that is something completely different, so in a way it was 2 movies in 1. The same happened with The Life of Pi.... I had to re-think everything to make a second interpretation of what I had really read on the first place."
5,Great Book,"Very few books make a lasting impact on me. However, this book has not left my mind. It is such a good book I've told all my friends about it and even bought them copies of it so I can have someone to discuss the book with. It is by far the best book I've read in a long long time, if not the best ever."
3,Great bookclub discussion book.,"This was a little hard to get into at first, but soon got interesting.It's a real question of what you believe in the end... a good book overall, I would recommend it."
4,Interesting reading,"I found this to be thoughtful and entertaining enough that I wanted to go back to it time and again. Worth the cost of admission, in my opinion, Martel has a fresh take on writing that I thought suited his subject matter. Not earth shattering, but one of the better stories I've read this year."
4,Life of Pi by Martel,"Life of Pi was an entertaing and provacative read. I enjoyed the insights about animals. The one negative for me was the ""carnivorous"" island. That challenged my ""suspension of disbelief""."
3,Life of....Oh my!,"I gave ""The Life of Pi"" three stars, because I was unable to finish it. That does not mean that I do not want to finish reading it - I do. I would not really recommend this book for any ""light summer reading."" However, I find the book to be powerful and parallel to the theme in Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness."" What happens to the social order of all beings when in isolation? It is a question that is asked again and again, and I look forward to finishing Martel's novel in the winter!"
4,A Unique Refreshing Story,"My neighbor gave me this book to read. She thought the story was just incredible. The author is new to me, but I am always willing to try another writer be they well established or up and coming authors. Many times I am grateful that I have done this. In this story ""Life of Pi"" I didn't know what to expect, but when I finished reading the book I thought it was an amazing story. Yann Martel's prose is highly effective and a joy to read. If there ever was a literary example of giving the reader an insight into the human mind then Life of Pi does it."
4,a Life-Affirming Concept,"I passed this book by for years (I think it came out in 2002), because the description on the jacket didn't interest me. But, as it turned out, the story of a zookeeper and his family becomes a Story (with a capital ""S"") not just an interesting tale of a boy who negotiates life on a boat with a tiger, or a book in defense of zoos. Since it's hard to do the book justice without including a few spoilers, suffice it to say that the novel is more than meets the eye, asking a few enduring questions about the extent to which personal reality is to some extent fiction, since our own imagination plays a role in how we interpret the events in our lives. Do we prefer an interpretation that is ""dry, yeastless, factuality"" or one that is life-affirming, finding purpose and a higher order, even in the most hostile of circumstances? It also asks one of the most decisive questions for each of us: Are we related to the infinite or not?"
2,Not for everyone,"I had high expectations prior to reading this book, but was incredibly disappointed. 'Life of Pi' was certainly well-written, and based on an interesting story. However, I found neither the journey nor the conclusion reached by this book to be the slightest bit compelling. I did not find this book entertaining or amusing, although I was frequently nauseated by some of the descriptions of events on the boat.My opinion appears to be the exception to the popular viewpoint. It is great that this book has achieved such a high level of success. However, I do not think it is for everyone."
3,Catching,"A sixteen-year-old boy, the only survivor of a shipwreck in the Pacific of a Japanese cargo. A journey that should have been the start of a new life. His father, the owner of a zoo in India, sold all the animals, part of them were on this ship, to start new in Canada. In this tragedy the boy loses his entire family and remains alone of his species on a lifeboat together with a hurt zebra, a shocked Orang-utan, a beastly Hyena and a Bengal Tiger, the latter who turns into his last companion, his greatest danger, but also his saviour! Can you believe it? A catching story."
5,Perfect,Great buy. the book was brand new and came really quickly. Had no trouble with the purchase which is always a great plus!
4,Life of Pi,Seems that there are two separate schools of thought in this book. Very good read but still must have missed the connection between his search for the ONE true God and his ordeal at sea.
2,Hate this kind of endings,"So the story is ok, but I really hate those kind of endings where the reader gets to choose what version is the real one. I mean, I am ok with fiction, I actually enjoy it, but when you get to choose if everything was just some dellusion.... well,it kind of ""kills"" it for me."
3,I'm not sure..,"This is an excellent book, but the religious side of it kind of ruined the story for me. As an Atheist, this is a bit too much, so.. It's alright, but not the best."
4,Inspiring and worth the read,"If 'Life of Pi' were longer, I would call it a 'spiritual epic'. It's not quite epic in scope, but it is certainly an incredible adventure and spiritual journey. Like the ocean which plays such an important role, this book has many levels of understanding- some clear and apparent, some less easy to discern, and some deep and mysterious and filled with surprises. I especially like the two stories at the end because only the individual can truly tell what an experience or encounter with Got means to them."
2,life of pi,I did not enjoy this book at all. It is probably one of the worst books I have ever tried to read. Not a good book for anyone in my opinion
2,Eh. Not great.,The claim that 'This book will make you believe in God' is a bit of a stretch; the book provides an ARGUMENT for believing in God. Oh well. I am more of a non-fiction kind of guy and this book just wasn't for me.
5,Life of Pi,"The Life of Pi is a very easy book to read. It is easy to get into, and it is almost as if you do not realize you are reading. I am not usually a reader who can sit with a book for a long time, but I was able to get through this book rather quickly, which shows how it kind of pulls you in.The ending of the book I actually really liked. It isn't the typical ending but that is what I like about it. It isn't how you would invision it. The thing that I liked about it was, well at first I thought it was kind of funny, because I thought it was just so unexpected and it was almost frusterating at the same time. My reaction at first was that I felt like I was tricked or something which made me kind of laugh. I was like I can't believe I read all this for this ending but anyway, it got people talking and that was probably the idea of the author. It separated it from other books. I enjoyed it!"
5,An amazing story from start to finish,"From the beginning and incredulous, a boy surviving in a life boat with a tiger?! Yea right.But within 4 pages in I was hooked and could not put the book down, I read the whole thing for five hours and even cried a little at the end (it takes a good book for me to do that).I lent the book to my mother who initially was skeptical, like me. She is also an English major so she is also critical of language, sentence structure, and format. Having her help with book report was lets just say ""unpleasant"".She loved the book, she even was uncertain if the book was fiction or true she loved it so much, she kept checking.I will not give away the ending but I will say this is great read for young and old. Religious or Atheist, Animal lover, biologist, and the young and old.If my mom loves it.. its really good!"
4,Worth reading!,"Decided to read this after seeing the movie. Usually would rather read book first but think knowing story helped get through some of the tedious parts of book. Overall, an engrossing story."
4,The life of pi,"Enjoyable fantasy. Many episodes were quite disgusting. Some descriptions were hard to visualize as riding the waves and flying fish not to mention a floating island. But, all in all a hard to believe survival story."
3,Dmg,Slow in the beginning but the story was intriguing and masterfully woven into an eventful saga. The story was painful but realistic.
3,Life of Pi,Only up to chapter 20. Nothing of intertest has happened in the story yet. just telling me about animals and religion. VERY SLOW STORY.
3,Strange ending,"The book was pretty interesting. I enjoyed most of the story especially his story about his time on the boat, but the ending was strange."
4,Didn't see it coming,"It took a while to get in to this story, if I hadn't read the preface I probably would have given up or put it down for a while. Really glad I did continue as I wasn't expecting the ending."
4,Deep Thoughts!,"Here is a boy who finds dissatisfaction with his life, changing a name which was an embarrassment to him, and seeking out religion, only to find dissatisfaction there too when the three clergymen starting arguing with one another. His adventure was a catharsis for him, and as the characters in the boat were dealt with, the uncertainties and disappointments of his life were dealt with too, basically in a positive manner. Great ending. It put the entire book into a healthy, rational perspective. And a page turner too . . ."
4,Beautiful and inspiring,"Here is an exceptional book that I read in a few sittings. It was always a pleasure to rejoin Pi on his seemingly impossible journey. It is slightly imbalanced, the story being very much in two halves, but I enjoyed both parts. My imagination was sparked continually by the clever use of language and the character of Pi's continuing amazement of the natural world. It's worth reading."
4,Fulfilling And Satisfying,"Creative and imaginative. Book is spiritual without being overly religious. Easy to read, joyful, sad and ultimately triumphant.Had me wishing and guessing all along. Finished the book in two readings."
1,Life of Pi...ridiculously horrible,"Ranks as the worst book I have ever encountered. No symbolic messages, nor meaningful relationship to my life whatsoever. Do not waste your time expecting a valuable message...vapid ridiculous kids tale gone bad."
4,"a wonderful story of faith, hope and courage","I found it a little confusing in the beginning but once I got into it, it was very thought provoking."
5,"Read It. An Exciting, Inspirational Tale!","This is no Jungle Book! I'm Obsessed, as I have ever been in a very long time, for totally different reasons. Can't wait to see the movie in 3D... But better to read the book first! A bargain that gives a big bang for your buck on Kindle right now!"
5,A very engaging book,"I really liked this book. It made me think of my chances of survival under extreme circumstances and what I would be willing to do to survive. I gained new perspective on zoo animals and whether they are ""happy"" living in their environment."
3,Life of Pie does not have a satisfying end,"I enjoyed reading about the young Pi and his family the zoo his father owned and the stories about the animals and his friends. I also found it refreshing to have a main character whose beliefs combined Christian/Indu/Islam beliefs. However, the sharing of a boat with a bengal tiger, etc., his arrival in Mexico, and the interrogation by the Japanese representatives did not ring true. The book had a disappointing ending for me."
3,Dragged by like a castaway's day at sea.,"I'm not sure how the whole religious exploration that made up the beginning of the book tied in. I guess it's purpose was to demonstrate the strength of faith. The middle of the book was dedicated to the main character's, Pi's, hellish ordeal as the lone human survivor of a shipwreck which is made even more arduous by his companion, a 450-lb. Bengal tiger. Although everyday is fraught with challenges for Pi, it was also fraught with monotony. The life of a castaway in the middle of the Pacific Ocean lacks variety and so did this book. The ending was the only interesting part as it made me question the power of the mind and the spirit's will to survive."
2,a draining read,"Life of Pi proved to be a dissappointing read. I started out with promise, but it was not particularly well written and, in fact, came off as Salman Rushdie light. The author broached some interesting emotional and spiritual themes, but failed to carry them throughout the plot. After following Pi's struggle for survival, I wished for greater resolution and meaning in the end."
3,ehh,"Took a while to get into, then by the time I did, it was over. the story is a great one, but awfully sad"
4,Good read,Excellent story. Read the book and thought my husband would enjoy it for one of his long road trips :)
4,A great book!,"This is a great book, very different from the ones I've read. It is not packed with multiple characters of whom you have to keep track of. The story is simple yet offers a lot of food for thought through two main characters, Pi and a Bengal tiger. It tells a simple yet deep tale of a teenage boy stranded in the ocean on a small ""boat"" with a huge tiger and how they stay together and survive together. I especially love the ending. If you are a member of a book reading club, it offers some very good discussion topics and thoughts to ponder upon at the end of a book which can be even more interesting than the book itself."
5,Hanging On !,"Though slow moving at times, this was a really good story of survival. I liked the characters and their struggles on the raft, and I liked the ending. I rate it almost as good as The Adventures of Archie Reynolds, by Gifford Bailey, and Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone, by J.K. Rowling."
5,Just The Kind of Book I Like,"""Life of Pi"" is not only an outstanding novel, but is also very interesting. First, the story is surperb with the Indian boy learning the many ways of life, animal life and religion. Second, it has the twist and turns that makes a book great. It has the story where the reader has to keep guessing and guessing to comprehend it. I love stories where your not sure what exactly is happening but you understand the main points. I love a good mysterious plot. This is the kind of book i like."
5,Life of Pi = amazing!!!,Life of Pi is an unbelievable book that I have started reading and cannot put it down. I try to read a certain amount of pages a day but I just read way more than needed due to it greatness. It is a very good fiction book for people that like adventure and survival especially at sea.
3,Fun quick read,Great book for a long flight! Not great literature but fun to read. Many thought provoking ideas. Dialog seems forced.
2,Intellectually insulting,"Although the author says he will make you believe in God, he never follows that up with anything persuasive. There were points when I cringed because it was so cheesy. I don't know how this book won the Booker Prize. At most, this is a cute story. There are many other survival stories that are better."
5,Life of PI,A beautiful story that takes you on a daily adventure of survival. Provides a rich history of culture and family
1,I beg to differ on this book's value.,"I read several critiques about this book before purchasing it. It is the most disappointing book I have ever read, largely because of my expectations from the hype it has received. I read it from cover to cover to be sure I wasn't missing the pearl in the oyster but it was a waste of my time.The cover of the book has a quote that I find ridiculous in light of the contents of the book. The quote is: ""wondrous storytelling that it may, as one character claims, make you believe in God"". The book is boring, far-fetched drivel masquerading as fine literature."
5,Great read,I really enjoyed the book. I now need to see the movie but am sure it will not compare to how good the book was!
3,miscellaneous nonsense,"Martel writes competently--if you like this sort of thing, to which ""miscellaneous nonsense"" applies most aptly. First, we're shooting off guns next to sloths (as in unaus and ais) to measure their responsiveness; then we're adopting apparently conflicting twin majors in college; then we're sailing in boats with mixed arks of beasts. I just didn't care for the whole thing, ultimately, candidly. And the bit about how Pi ""amazed and perplexed"" three monotheistic clerics by being interested in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam was dead to my ears: I've adopted all three, let alone studied! (Well, I still have issues with an-Nisa 4:157, admittedly.)"
5,Great literature that's also entertaining!,"I never expected to get sucked into this novel like I did, but I'm certainly glad that I read the reviews on this site and gave this book a shot! Life of Pi is by far the best book I've read all year -- and the type of book I'll certainly read again! Beautifully written and substantial while being incredibly entertaining. This book is a rarity! Other recommended titles are The Losers' Club by Richard Perez and Will@epicqwest.com by Tom Grimes"
3,Great American Leather Updated Tote,Disappointed with this bag. Quality was poor then again it wasn't expensive either. I have ordered other Great American bags and have been happier with them.Thanks
5,AWesome sound editing for the price,"I bought this product becuase of the prie and listed capabilities. I am by no means an expert, I am just an average Joe that was needing some software to edit our digital recordings at church. Sony Sound Forge Studio 8 is the perfect software package for my needs. I highly recomend for ""home-studio"" music editing!"
5,Real Good Hip-Hop,"I recently bought this album on vinyl at a record store about a month ago.. all I have to say is that I really like it. I think probably my favorite track on here is ""Fair Weathered Friend"" but I also like ""Devotion"" and ""Methods"" quite a bit.. and ""Red Light, Green Light"" isn't bad either.. overall it's a good hip-hop record.. so if your looking for some quality hip-hop I would recommend you checking this record out..Justin"
3,Bicycle Accident Reconstruction - Some Issues,Having practiced as a motor vehicle crash analyst for over 40 years I found this book useful but marred by some unfortunate lapses in parts of the analysis. That was disappointing for me but I have kept it as a reference for the Author's work.
4,"Perfect condition, larger than expected","I ordered 2 casserole dishes and they came in perfect condition. Looking very good on our dining table and goes very well with our dining set. They were a little larger than I expected; the picture doesn't do it perfect justice! Only used for serving, not sure I want to risk putting in the oven or dishwasher!"
1,First Bad PC Tool,"Nice hefty medium service tool, however when received this tool was dripping with oil. Soon learned that it only functioned in high speed due to a broken switch. Returned the drill and re-ordered based on good experience on many other PC tools. The return procedure was extreamly easy - very helpful/plesant rep. on the telephone."
3,"Not bad as a synthesis of AMORC teachings, but bad history","This volume is an accessible text answering most of the questions an aspiring member of AMORC might have had. Well pitched and a testament to Lewis's marketing and promotional skills.However the 'history' provided is generally poor, and I would check with empirical sources before taking many of Lewis's assertions as fact. His comments on the Masonic Rosicrucian bodies are both highly inaccurate and blatantly sectarian, for example.So, an interesting read, and a good window on a particular period of Rosicrucian history, but don't treat it as gospel . . ."
5,A former Lifetime,"This book took me back 26 years. To the former company that I retired from in 1979. It is written in the present tense, but if I had read it in 1975, it would have told my story of how we prepared a company to show the pentagon this company was able to build a product that is still being used by the US Navy today. I had the privilege of spending 14 days as a Tiger Cruise participant on the aircraft carrier ""USS CARL VINSON"".It was such a thrill to see four Phalanx missile systems being used on this ship. It was a bigger thrill to see this system being fired at night and knowing I had something to ""Make It Happen"""
3,excitement ended in disappointment,"i was so excited when i ordered these shoes. First of all, these shoes arrived a week after the estimated arrival which upset me greatly since i was highly eager. then when they finally got here,they sent me the wrong shoes! i ordered the patent shoes (shiny) and i even reviewed my order form to see if maybe it was an error on my part. and it wasnt i infact ordered the patent wedges and was sent the pu wedges (non shiny)>_< the shoes non the less were very comfortable and since these shoes took so long to get here im not even going to return them who knows how long itll take before the new pair get here. then to top it off after trying them on and modeling them around the house to show them to my family the label inside the shoe peeled off....in short, beautiful shoe, very comfortable.terrible service."
5,Amazing harmonica playing.,"One word: wow.A must have-cd for students of the blues harmonica and for fans of innovative, heartfelt blues.Wonderful liner notes as well."
5,Terrific Puzzle for Geography,"This toy was used in a mixed 5-8 geography class for a contest. The students loved it ,and they learned the countries placement using it.I plan to buy the others in the series."
4,Very Informative,"Loved it. Just shows that when a person is free, they would do anything to get that freedom back if it were ever taken away from them."
4,Very Funny,"If you enjoy community, but always wanted it to get darker and weirder than this is for you. But, if you're not in to sometimes creepy sometimes profane, than it might be worth skipping.Personally, I enjoyed it thoroughly."
3,BLIND LEADING THE BLIND,"this video is informative. but it shed no light on the miscommunication between north korea and america. if anything, it deepens the rift.documentary makers really need more cultural understanding of their subject matters."
1,Student of Animal Sciences,"If you want to know some truly factual information about the dairy industry read a text book and not a book by a propagandist. ""Animal Science and Industry"" (AS&I) by Cunningham, Latour and Acker goes deep into the dairy industy practices in several chapters, as well as the industry of all animals. The biggest problem I have with the book is the notion that the milk we drink from bovine is loaded with antibiotics. This is simply not true! There is ZERO TOLERANCE for antibiotics in milk processed from the dairy industry. All milk is tested for level of bacteria, antibiotics and even squamos cell levels. There are specific standards for ""Grade A"" milk and if they are not met the dairy farm in question will lose this ""Grade"" license and the milk will be unfit for human consumption. ""AS&I"" specifically states that hormone use is NOT RECOMMENDED in the animal industry; of course this is not to say it isn't practice. Simply be aware of the products you are buying."
1,Wow,If i could rate this book a zero.... i would. This is the biggest load of ... i've ever read in my entire life! I seriously hope that all of you poor fools who bought this ... used it to fuel your fires in the winter time..... Who is going to believe that milk is a genocidal government plot to destroy African-American children... probably the same ... who think that the government is hiding aliens from us...
5,It's amazing,This knife is so nice I don't have to dirty all my other knifes when using this knife it get's all the jobs done. I almost didn't order this knife but I'm happy that I did. I will be buying more for gifts for my family and friends because it's so wonderful.
2,meh...,"Its more or less well made junk. If you have expectations, you will be very disappointed. If you just want a ""santoku"" knife to add to your collection, it may be just what you want."
2,How disappointing!,"ok when I first got these speakers I would have given them at least 4 stars. Good sound for the money.But I didn't write a review. Now, 4 months later, I get no sound from the right speaker; the one with the control knobs. I checked out everything I could think of, but nothing out of the right speaker. When I plug in headphones, I get both channels just fine which is why I still give them 2 stars. I read the other reviews before choosing to buy these so I figure it's only fair to warn other buyers that they may have the same bad luck as me and get the ones that break down AFTER the 30 days in which you can return them. 4 months for $25 is just NOT enough."
2,Product changed.,This eye liner completely changed.I used it before. Was very good. Now it is bad quality! Very dry. I even got allergy.
1,Sound qualtiy,"i had the previous nokia, the hs-11w. it was an excellent product. it was the only earpiece that i could hear with. i'm a railroad engr. i could hear all conversations on the engine. this upgrade, the hs-26w, has very poor hearing capability, the volume is too low. even with the volume turned all the way up, i can't hear normal conversation. very disappointed."
4,Not bad really,I have one of these units and it lasts me with my jwin portable dvd player about 5-6 hours. As I recall no effective directions for charging came with unit. Directions basically said to charge for a couple of hours. Not really sure how many hours that means. Personally I experimented and found that between 9 to 12 hours results in 5 to 6 hours playtime.
3,Poor Customer Service,"I bought this and needed some help understanding the software. Confusing websites. When you call, you can't understand the service people who speak English very poorly. It's a real headache to figure out what they are saying. Magellan is not a customer-friendly company, and they don't seem to say much more than scripted comments. I just didn't like dealing with Magellan.The unit worked well until the SD cover broke off. Battery compartment is hard to remove to get to the SD card. I returned the GPS to the store for a refund and am trying to figure out what to buy next. Maybe I should wait for a company that will make their GPS Mac compatible. The GPS industry overall seems ten years behind the times on dealing with the public."
5,American Pathfinder struts his stuff,"George Antheil (1900-1959)was a man whose music provoked riots in Paris 75 years ago. Sadly he seems to have been completely forgotten today. The piano was his instrument and he writes for it with considerable skill. Benedikt Koehlen is more than equal to the formidable demands that Antheil places on the performer. The pieces on this well recorded CD still sound quite ""modern."" All five of Antheil's piano sonatas are recorded here as well as six other works of considerable interest. If you like the Prokofiev of the 6th Sonata or the Bartok of the 3 Etudes, then you should enjoy this."
1,i don't like movie life,i don't like movie life. i also don't like pretty much any other drive-thru band either.
1,Not worth it unless you really don't care...,"... about how your music sounds. I hooked my VS2221 speakers up tonight and will be returning them ASAP. I listen to a lot of music on my computer and the low end distorts an awful lot with these speakers, which is something my crappy basic Dell speakers didn't do. This is even more evident with using a set of headphones. I adjusted the subwoofer as much as possible and the only way to get the distortion to stop was to turn the sub all the way down - which defeats the purpose of choosing a 2.1 system over a 2.0 system. Not worth the money I paid for them."
4,You & Me,"I could not find this on vinyl so had to pick up the CD--beautiful packaging--even the CD looks like the label of the record (Uni label) in a nice sleeve--deluxe job!Music is great..Gypsy Woman, You & Me....Like the previous reviewer noted there could have been some bonus tracks appended--like all the UNI singles and B-Sides (""No Place To Run"" ""Only Want To Make You Happy"" etc)--but why complain. Lucky to have it on any format at all. Highly recommended."
1,You've GOT to be kidding,"Having Aaron Cater in the music business was bad enough, but now I find out that ANOTHER Carter sibling is doing it?I dont need to hear the music to figure out what it sounds like. Titles like ""Oh Wow"" and ""I wanna be your girl"" just scream for originality. Anyone who says this girl isn't riding her brother's coatails is just plain wrong. Same goes for the other brother, Aaron."
5,Exactly what expected,Our glass canopy was wore out...could not find one at our local stores to replace it! This was exactly what we needed! Looks great! Received promptly from company. Would highly recommend them!
4,Sweatshirts,"These sweatshirts are very nice but not as heavy as I thought they might be. But overall, they are still nice sweatshirts. The size is perfect, but they do shrink a little."
3,Review,I purchased this one out of pure curiosity. There are a few fine moments but I was left underwhelmed.
4,"same book as ""pakistani bride""","for those of you that dont know, this bk was republished under the title ""the pakistani bride."" ""ice man candy"" was also republished under the title ""cracking india.""this is an amazing bk though, already wrote the review for the other though"
1,Full of Fluff,"How anyone can rate this book at 5 stars is beyond me. This book is not only one of the weaker contributions to the literature on complexity in the past two years, it fails to live up to the title. No one who reads this book will know how to take the first step toward ""harnessing complexity."" At best, they will have the broadly useful idea that it's good to experiment with new ideas (exploration) every now and then, and then pick the ideas that work (exploitation). That hardly seems like a great breakthrough. Organizational Implications of a Scientific Frontier?! Get real."
4,Clear thinking on complexity,"In clear, non-technical prose, the authors spell out the practical implications of complexity theory for a variety of domains. They use lots of examples to illustrate their points, and deliberately keep the discussion at a level accessible to non-experts. If you were baffled by Stuart Kauffman's writings, you'll be surprised to learn that complexity theory has practical applications!"
1,BLAH!,I bought this brush at Beauty Brands thinking it was going to be a GREAT brush because it's a CHI. Well... it sucks! After the first use it totally broke down. The bristles melted or something! It's a disaster. I wish I could take it back. I hate it! I have another generic round brush I bought at Sally's for 9 dollars that lasted me WAY longer than this brush!
2,Not what I had expected it to be,I was expecting a black antenna to match my black car. this is silver/chrome. It is very short if that's what you're looking for.
5,In The Sweet Light,"The Sweet Light is a must read! If you have yet to know love, if your heart knows the magical feeling of finding THE one or your heart still beats for the one that got away, you will truly enjoy this beautifully written book! Alex's use of words pulls you into this story as if you are there. I highly recommend this book and I'm looking forward to future publications of Alex's series!!"
4,Kindergarteners chose McDuff over four other books.,"Four classes of Kindergartners voted to read McDuff's New Friend over three other books (about monsters, magic, and big bad wolves...) Their only question about the text was ""What are galoshes?"" The children here enjoy McDuff's adventures!"
1,McDuff's New Friend,"This was a huge disappointment as we already had this exact book under the title, McDuff's Christmas. Please come up with original titles!"
1,Wasted money,"We bought this book in the hopes of finding good cheap restaurants in Paris. Not so. This book was completely useless. The phone numbers of many of the restaurants are inaccurate, and some of the restaurants do not even exist anymore. Each time we tried to use this book to find a place to eat, we came up empty handed. In fact, we found some wonderful places just by walking around. I certainly would not recommmed spending your money on this book."
3,Great Book but Outdated,"Back in the late '90's & early 2000's this book was the best of its kind & rated 5 stars then. Our favorite restaurant of all time ""A La Biche au Bois"" & our 2nd favorite ""Le Petit St. Benoit"" were found here & both are still in business. But copyright 1998 (meaning the data was probably gathered in 1997) makes it oudated. What drives this home is that the menu prices are given in French francs.Personal message to Sandra: We need you back in Paris updating your book!!!"
5,Zelda Oralcle of ages,- Interesting plot line - levels extremely complicated - need strategy guide to successfully complete game - charecters very interesting - thought it was cool that tingle returned - hard to understand at first
1,Faker!,"This Game, Oracle of Ages, was something that I wanted to play for a while now. When it finally came in, I rushed to find my Gameboy Advance and plop the cartridge in. When I did, It didn't work at all. After the screen said Gameboy, it turned and stayed white. I brought it in to Play N Trade to see if they could fix it, but the in-game battery died. I don't blame the game. I blame the seller. It was wrapped in a bag from Jewel-Osco. Seriously? Since then, I've been trying to find out how to fix it, but I need a 3.8 mm Gamebit Screwdriver. I won't ask for a refund. I'm asking for the screwdriver. It's the least you could do, Amazon."
2,Not Worth the Price,"I read all sorts of rave reviews about JW Macy's Cheesesticks, so I thought I'd try them.I don't know about the other flavors, but this one tastes burnt. The texture is much harder than I expected as well. I guess I shouldn't have assumed that they'd be crispy like real cheesesticks, which are usually made from puff pastry.These were just plain HARD. Hard and burnt. Lovely."
5,A History Lesson,"This disk shows that there is not much difference between the way politicians deal with war today than the way they dealt with it 100 years ago.I liked the way the different speaches goaded americans off into war - even though it was far away and a lot of people probably had no idea why we were fighting.This is an interesting study in propoganda during war time.I liked it. If that makes me a nerd, so be it."
4,"It was just fine, but...",The o-rings were just fine but I really think that you should put the actual picture of the item instead of a picture of a different brand. Otherwise a good item.
4,Can't go wrong with a yellow drill....,....even if it's reconditioned.Makes nice clean dimples on sheetrock once you replace the factory bit with a real drywall bit. It has enough torque that it DOESN'T EVEN BURP when you finish driving the screw! Does great with square-head composite deck screws as well.
3,It's ok for regular home use,"I got this set for Christmas a few years ago as I had asked for a knife set. It does not stay as sharp as I would like. I would recomend getting them professionally sharpened every 6 months. They are comfortable to use and easy to clean. The steak knives were not really all that sharp though and I had a hard time getting them as sharp as I wanted.I cook quite often and I feel this set was not superior enough for my needs so I am getting a Mundial set and will probably give the Chicago set away. It is not a bad set, but if you are a foodie and hate sharpening knives, save up and get something of higher calliber."
1,Missing Keystrokes,"Like the other models of HP, the 35s and 300s, this one too suffers from missed keystrokes.I like the look of this calculator, and if you are slow, and deliberate with your keystroke entry, you can get results. However, when you first turn it on and start to press the keys with any speed the calculator seems to hic-cup and does not record your entries.The HP 35s exhibits this behavior also. The last great non-graphing scientific calculator produced by HP was the HP 32sII. HP has gone downhill in calculator manufacturing. Too Bad."
5,I love it,I had lost my calculator in a flood a few months ago and missed it dearly. It was also an HP10bII I absolutely loved that calculator. I loved it so much I purchased the exact same one I had with Amazon. I'm so glad to have it back!
2,"Good functions, bad display","I bought this calculator a few years ago for a finance class, and it was easy to use and performed well. I am now taking some other classes that require present value calculations, so I dusted off the calculator. It worked for about a week before the display started malfunctioning. I bought new batteries as other people did, but that is not the problem. I also reset it in the various ways described in the manual, but the display was still malfunctioning. It is very disappointing since the calculator was not actually used that much."
4,good calc,"I'm not a fan of finance, but this calc gets the job done, and is also my professor's fav, so that has to count for something."
3,HP 10bll,It was required for school so I don't really have much knowledge about it yet. The thing I don't like about it is that I have been in school for 5 weeks and I have changed the battaries three times. Now I take them out untill I use it.
4,Good calculator,I needed a financial calculator for my new business. I decided on the HP over the TI based on the recommendation of a friend. I find the calculator easy to use but I am still dependent on the instruction book for more complicated calculations. I am sure when I have used it more I won't need the manual any more.
1,Poor Quality,"I had this for maybe 3 years, hardly used it, never abused it, and one of the LCD digits burned out."
5,Fast Service...Good Product...,"I received this product on schedule, at the same price as in the stores for a brand new calculator, but I did not have to go anywhere to pick it up. It was conveniently delivered to my door."
2,10B II Hewlett packard caculator,"I enjoyed this calculator, but I use the 10B a older version. It is just easier to me."
1,Poor execution of a good idea.,"Typical Chinese clumsiness and low quality. The on off button is too easily bumped to on, and the little sack they call a case is so tight it activates the on button.I cannot carry it in my pocket or briefcase without turning it on and depleting the batteries, so it sits in or on my desk. I leave it out, and no one will even steal it. Both of the two I have had were intermittent. The first one had the display die, but it was replaced under warranty. Wish they had given me a TI BA II+ instead. Wish I had bought one instead.The third one just had the display fail. All the characters are not complete.What a tragedy that a fine company like HP used to be is now peddling such junk."
5,Exactly as described,"I needed to get this calculator for a college course I am taking this semester. I almost waited too long, but it was processed and shipped quickly and it actually arrived a couple of days before I needed it."
2,very disappointed with HP 385 Printer,"I was very disappointed when I tried to use this item, HP 385 Photo Printer, I know it wasn't a new item, but said like new, but when I tried to print with it, I printed 2 photos and wasted lots of paper because the pictures come out red & green mess !!! I had to go to Wal-mart and buy a new ink cart, which cost 31.87. I feel that someone needs to replace my money on the ink cart.I am very satisfied with the order as far as placing my order and recieving but not product.hope to hear from someone...JoAnn Campbellorder item ID: 33838097750418HP Photosmart 385 Compact Photo Q6387A#ABA)"
5,This is an incredible book which kept me turning the pages.,The Power To Destroy is a terrific book for every taxpayer. It was a page-turner that left me knowing how to deal with the IRS. It has great stories and a strong message with real workable recommendations. And it is very accessible for everyone.
4,Roast Fish and Corn Bread Seems Like A Fishy Combo But It Works,"Lee ""Scratch"" Perry is one of my favorite reggae artists. The man has put his stamp on so many great records (mostly from a production standpoint). On this album, Lee Perry flexes his vocal stylings over some excellent riddims. While his voice might not be as impressionable as a Bob Marley or a Michael Rose, Lee can definitely throw down. Favorites include ""Roast Fish and Corn Bread"" which sports a hard hitting bassline along with a droned out bell effect. It's the perfect song for those blessed with a quality sound system. ""Soul Fire"" is an all-time favorite of mine. The production is classic Perry. Soaring horns, a percussion that sounds like steam out of a kettle, low reverb bass, and Lee Perry pouring his soul into this monster of a song. This is an album that shouldn't be missed when checking for some great reggae music!"
4,"""Not that hard to assemble"" says husband.","My husband has put together basic things, like cribs, some little nightstands, IKEA stuff, etc. He's a ""steady as you go"" kind of german guy, so he reads the directions, and just does what they say.I'd say it took him about 2 hours, putting it together without rushing. Says it's not hard ""at all"" just time-consuming, and you need to just follow the directions. Everything is labeled."
4,Nice enough. Requires a little extra though.,"This is a pretty nice unit. Good look and all. The drawer slides are plastic, never seen that before, but they work fine so far. It is constructed mostly of dense particleboard. Not ideal but economic and effective.My concern was for the sway of the unit when all set up. Granted, I had not yet nailed in the cardboard-like backing provided, but the thing had several inches of movement when I would rock it side to side.I felt that the stability the may be provided by nailing in the provided backing would not be enough to make me feel comfortable, so I went to Lowes and bought a 1/4"" thick wood sheet which I cut to fit the back, painted it white and screwed it in. Solid as a rock now.This is a good unit for the price. As in all things, you do get what you pay for. Caveat emptor."
2,Cute but downsides...,"Very nice looking, but:One, this took HOURS AND HOURS to put together. I am no constructing slouch but there was some serious muttering with this one. Man vs table and table almost won.Two, very strong chemical smell inside the drawers. It stunk up baby's clothes and I has to wash them all over."
4,Cute,Very pleased with this product. Very easy to put together and is also very sturdy. This piece does appear it may scratch and dent easy so not sure how long it will look so nice...
4,Country comfort and style,"This is a very attractive changing table and the style works well with many different pieces of nursery furniture. One definite drawback are the instructions. As usual for non-USA made items of furniture, the details of the instructions are poor."
4,good for the price,This was great for the price just was very hard to construct...my husband got a bit frustrated because instructions are not clear at all but about an hour 1/2 later we had a beautiful changing table. It looks great in the nursery...and you can't beat the price. :)
2,Looked 3 years old out of the package,"When my husband unpacked the box, we were really disappointed. It is made of cheap particle board (there are different qualities of particle board). The corners were chipped off. I don't see how it can be shipped without being damaged. Too bad, it was the perfect size for our room. We returned it."
3,Cute,"I am not sure how long this piece will last, but it looks really cute in our nursery. The clips that hold the drawers in are made of plastic so I would assume you can't place anything too heavy in the drawers (but it's for a nursery, so that's ok!) Once together it seems sturdy. It's a cute addition to our little girl's room!"
2,dont buy it!!!,"i bought this changing table because we both like the style very much and it matches the crib. but Lord IT IS PAINFUL TO PUT IT TOGETHER, dont understand why they have all the little tools so complicated and there are sooo many... and the quality of the changing table its just crap!!! i can use my fingers to loose some nails right after put them in... not worth the money at all!!!! dont buy it!!! same price range, you should go to Ikea, at least theirs are easy to install. and FedEx sent it to the wrong person on the lower floor, we have to wait for several more days to get it from them. happened many time with FedEx already!!! always use DHL or UPS!!!! FedEx sucks!!!! so bad quality and bad deliver company, BIG NO NO TO THIS PRODUCT!!!"
5,Adorable in the nursery!,This arrived in perfect condition. It was very easy to put together and it looks so cute! Great for the price! The drawers are nice and big and the top fits the changing pad perfectly! I love it!
1,Waste of time and money,"My husband is very handy and spent 3 hours trying to put this together for our 3rd child.Not only were the directions horrible, some of the screws and other materials were missing.We ended up throwing this piece of particle board in the trash and purchased another tableFrom a local retailer. Take my advice. Do not purchase this product!!!!"
4,"Beautiful, Awesome, Sturdy","I've read a lot of the reviews and I don't have too much to add. Just a short review to say how pleased we are with the price and design of this piece. It loses one star because, like many others have already stated, putting it together sucks! Patience and a couple hours need to be set aside before beginning the build! It's worth it. :)) Also, we did not get a ""blemish marker"" that someone else said they received, so I will be contacting them about that. Good luck!!!"
2,Hmm,"So I purchased this dresser/changing table because of the price, color & design. I do love it although it had so many steps to put together along with it being cheaply made...there are many chips, marks & the one corner is cracked plus the front piece on the bottom doesnt fit securely."
4,Whitney Houston Greatest Hits,gI love Whitney Houston. Almost all her big hits are on this CD. This is all we have left. She is gone too soon
2,Bad Kitty Review,"I think that the book ""Bad Kitty"" is one of the most terrible books that i have ever read. ""Bad Kitty"" has a very bad plot and is not very interesting at all. On a scale of one to ten i would give this book a three, beacause it is not even good as a mystery book. I usually read action and adventure books so that may be why i don't like it very much.The thing i most liked about this book is that it had many surprises and unexpected things in the plot. I also kind of liked how it was set up and that it had a third person point of view. One more thing i liked about ""Bad Kitty"" was the title of it; the title was what first got me to read the book."
5,Mastercard!!!,"This book is one of my American Expresses. I don't leave home without it! Bad Kitty's witty comebacks, snappy dialouge, fast-paces mystery, and thrilling plot make it one of my favorites. I cracked up laughing at the footnotes and Little Life Lessons, and wished I had friends as funny as Roxy, Polly, Tom and Jas. Michelle Jaffe is an expert at writing a book that captures the attention of teen girls and makes your sides split wih laughter. I read it over and over and over, and I absolutley LOVE the little computer-people that Polly makes. The Henchtwins are perfect villians, although I found myself liking Veronique and her analyzing, ""How To for Dummies"" self. I fell in love with Jack and smiled when Fred got Jas into trouble. I really love this book and hope other people read and enjoy it. I would recomend it to anyone."
4,What to do once you HAVE the job,"This is a good book because it deals with what to do after you get the coveted job. A lot of books deal with getting a great job, but then what? Chances are, you're not gonna be at the same job until retirement.I learned a lot from this book, like how to be a well-rounded employee. One needs to be an expert, entreprenurial and engaging. I'm only the latter, but it's important to be the first two also in order to get ahead.I just got a new job recently and my boss gave me a large manual on how to work one of the intensive computer programs. In the old days, I would have let it collect dust on my desk. Now, in order to become an expert (and look good to the boss), I'm definately going to leaf through it and try to become more knowledgeable about my job -- and life-long career. It can only serve me well in the end.Bravo to Eyres et. al. for sifting life down to a project-by-project basis. It makes it so much easier to swallow in smaller, well-planned bites!"
4,These are 2-way not 3-way,"These are 2-way spreakers not 3-way. Amazon's description is incorrect.Would change rating to 5 star if I could after listening to them.Look and sound great, speedy shipping! Arrived in 1 day by slowest shipping. Amazon rocks. Just installed them in my '99 Honda Civic at Ckt City. Sound blew me away. I was missing so much with the 8-year old original car speakers. I can undestand Bob Dylan's every word now!"
3,Not happy with speed,"In Nero, I literally cannot burn with the speed over 4x. It is the only choice in the speed drop-down selector. I still have left older, 8x Memorex and 16x HP, Philips and Sony blank media disks, which burn fine up to 16x without a problem.Here is an info from Disk Tools for this media:Manufacturer: : RitekMID : RITEKF1Write speeds: : 4 XNo damaged disks so far though... (burned 4 of them)"
1,Poor quality disks,"There were more bad disks with this package than I ever had before. Don't buy them, buy better quality disks."
2,It not packaged good,I didn't get to really to use a lot of these dvd because the way it was packaged my dvd were broken even the thing that suppose to hold the dvd in the middle was broken as well. Purchase something like this through amazon the company has extra support.
3,"great dvd's, bad shipping","The DVD's are great.Unfortunately, Amazon shipped them basically as a loose spindle in a large box, they were broken open and scattered about the box by the time I got them. Some have failed to burn on this set for my first time ever with this specific DVD."
4,A few coasters,"Over all, these are good disks. I have used them in the past and I would get 1 coaster out of 100. This must have been a bad batch. I have gotten 6 and have only used 15 disks"
4,Packaged Terribly,No question Amozon.com has these dvd's for the cheapest price around. But if you plan to buy 300 or more be ready to recieve some broken dvd's and cases. the price is the only reason i buy them from amazon.com they really need to do a better job at packaging these disc for shipment.
4,Discs,Some discs were not usable but for the most part the package was a good buy.I would recommend it.Thank you.
1,Trash,These DVDs were noticeably thinner than any other I have used. And when I attempted to duplicate home movies with them I was getting errors on 2/5 consistently through a whole spindle. I would suggest Verbatim or Amazon brand which rarely give errors.
5,Carville DVD,"Very good service, especially when Amazon pointed out to me that DVDs from different parts of the world may not work on local DVD players (I live in New Zealand) - something we were able to sort out quite simply, but wouldn't have known about without the warning from Amazon. Thank you.The DVD itself gave a good picture of life at Carville."
3,Hard to Fully Appreciate,"While often interesting, it was often repetitive (same problem, e.g., his malaria, or the rain, or the deceitfulness of the natives he deals with). He gives descriptive and interesting accounts of hunting and some of the scenery and difficulties he encounters and these make for interesting reading for those interested in some of the earliest accounts of Central Africa, but much of what he says about his search for the river's source is very hard to follow because there are no maps and places he speaks about in 1863 no longer exist on modern maps. This makes it almost impossible to appreciate his travels and in some way understand some of his decisions."
3,This book can be summarized on one sentence,"This is a detailed and well-researched book which essentially says one thing: The future of worldwide Christianity is Pentecostalism.I agree with the author that this is what the current trend seems to indicate, but I think that Pentecostalism will soon become a dying fad. The author says it himself that fringe groups in Christianity usually begin in Pentecostal ways, and then over time, become more mainstream, organized, and theologically sound. I think that the reason Pentecostalism is seeing a resurgence in places like Africa, Asia, and South America is because Christianity is having a revival in those places. As the people settle down into the historical practices of Christianity, many of the Pentecostal elements will fade away as well."
2,Enjoyment to horror,"I was enjoying Jenkins book up until the part where he described the countries that were experiencing the most rapid growth of Christianity and Islam and I realized that these are the very same countries that have the highest human rights abuses, the most horrid repression of their female population. Jenkins did not address this correlation and I read no further. May God help us all if this book predicts the future."
3,good book,good book that sheds some light on the church worldwide and points out what international christendom will do for the future of the church.
1,Not What I Expected,"I was very disappointed when I opened up my newly received DVD of Samson and Delilah thinking that it would be in the rich beautiful color that the original movie was in. Boy was I disappointed. The color was very faint plus I was surprised to see that it has Chinese subtitles. If I knew that it was made in China I would have never purchased the movie. The quality if very poor and fuzzy. I will never order another movie from this distributor again. I feel this was a waste of my money. I will now have to find another distributor who has a copy of this movie that I can buy that is not a Chinese copy, that is an American made copy and of better quality. Buyers beware of this distributor. I believe all their movies are Chinese quality."
5,Great game!,This game is really great It is identical to Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and with both of them you can create a linked game or secret game which are almost two different adventures.Also if you have both games you can get weapons like the master sword or mirror shield. In this game their are 8 dungeons with 8 mini bosses and bosses and also a final boss. This game is pretty challeging with puzzles and a great story line. It also has good sound and pretty decent graphics.
4,Great game!,"My son had been looking around for this older game and asked me to check on Amazon, where I was able to find it right away and order it for his birthday. He was very happy when it arrived and still plays it."
5,the greatest,i think that this game is way awesome its my favorite game that i own i still haven finished it yet but i enjoy it because it provides a very challenging experience that is also very fun.i do get frustraded and have to put it down every one and a while but it is still a great game.i would reccomend this game to anyone even adults.it has awesome graphics and is nintendo at its best.i would also reccomend a player guide just to look at when your really stumped but not for every move.hope that this was helpful!!!
1,Shame on Adobe!,"I have been LEGALLY using Adobe software for years, including Photoshop, PageMaker, LiveMotion, GoLive, Acrobat, etc. I own two registered copies of Acrobat 3.01 and I was still unable to install the 5.0 upgrade! I tried the passcode, pointing to the CD, everything! Adobe Tech support finally tells me that the reason my install is failing is because I still have the previous version on my machine...so I have to edit my registry. If this is your method of preventing software piracy (by keeping valid users uphappy), then shame on you, Adobe!Adobe has since released a revised CD, so I was told by tech support when I recently had to reinstall several times. His response was that if I did not like having to call for a new passcode each time I have to reinstall, then I should BUY the corrected CD. Never offered me a patch. Can you believe it?"
1,LESS Functionality isn't worth the money,"Although pdf files are very useful in digitizing paper materials, the fact that Adobe crippled its 5.0 version of its Paper Capture (OCR, text recognition) functionality is shameful. When I purchase an upgrade, I expect BETTER functionality, not worse. With 5.0, you can only capture 50 pages of a document - if its longer than 50 pages, you must purchase the... Adobe Capture product. With the previous version (4.0x), there was NO limit to the number of pages and no need to waste more money. Do NOT buy this product - go... buy somebody's 4.0 version... (Note: the 4.0 version of paper capture does NOT work with Windows XP and no bug fix is provided...)."
3,Wow,"Dean and Jerry hacks fumble through this Alley McBeal-thin plot. The only genuine talent is Bela Lugosi, though his skin and his personality are that of a leather suitcase by now. My suggestion is to pop in Ed Wood after seeing this movie. It will give you some idea of Bela's later years of life, and besides, it's just a great movie. But Brooklyn Gorilla...okay...Instead of watching it, you can beat yourself with a bullwhip and go through less pain... there, I just zinged this movie and now I'm done."
3,Bargain Bela,"If you really must own this title, you're better off purchasing this budget-priced edition rather than spending more elsewhere. It's an excellent quality copy of this oft-maligned movie. Actually, it's not that bad for what it is...in fact, it's often quite amusing. Sammy Petrillo's imitation of Jerry Lewis is uncanny."
2,Imitation Isn't Always Flattering...,"This movie could have been a classic IF... #1- Bela Lugosi had been awake. #2- The real Dean Martin / Jerry Lewis had actually been involved in any way, instead of the stagehands who apparently stood in for them. Unfortunately, the artificial Martin sings (Like a hinge) and the synthetic Lewis acts like an imbecile throughout. All without being funny. #3- It had been directed by anyone other than William Beaudine (Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter), even Jethro Beaudine! As it stands, BROOKLYN GORILLA has very little charm or appeal. However, the kids (toddlers) might get a kick out of it. I mean, there is a guy in a gorilla suit and there are goofy natives running around! Enjoy, if you can..."
2,Horrible!,"This movie was so bad, I even had a difficult time riffing it. The two night-club actors do a nails-running-across-a chalk-board kind of annoying imitation of Lewis and Martin on an island filled with natives that were whiter then white. The only actors in this film that could actually act were the chimp and Lugosi. This flick makes Ed Wood seem like Spielberg."
3,Over The Top And Uncanny Resemblence To Martin and Lewis,"Bella's last movie. He coldn't get any other work. His schtick had worn out by this time but he was still Bella! This movie is like no other. Total schlock comedy that is soooo bad , it's good. If you aren't a little warped yourself you may not like it. Doesn't hurt to be a little high either while watching it. You have to be able to appreciate the bizarre. VERY hard to find item."
1,Absolute junk as far as reliability goes.,"Nice looking radio, sounded good for about 3 hours total use. THEN..power on/off selector, except for counter clock, will not power up ANY functions. Should be easy to fix, right? NO. Small town repair shop(S) CAN NOT fix it. Save your money. Marv Krupp"
2,Generally a disappointment,"For what is supposed to be a world class receiver, I found the overall reception weak. Perhaps the problem is being located in a big city, with interference from buildings, jets, etc., but the Grundig people should really let the potential consumer know that the good reception best occurs when the user lives in a rural area. I find that when I take the radio to a remote area, the reception is excellent, but living where I do, I am frankly disappointed. The radio does have a nice design and overall ""feel"" but maybe is best for small town users and Europeans"
4,CRUISERIFFIC,"Nice headlight with a sturdy housing, no instructions and a bracket (fork stem mount only) that could be sturdier. I used it for 20 mile trip with no problems. The switch has several on and off positions with only one lamp intensity. The light was clean low intensity white with about a 20 yard effective range and illuminated a circle about 10-12 ft in diameter. This worked marginally for truly dark areas but was adequate around town with the aid of street lights. Having a headlight increased my ability to be seen by other traffic. I would recommend it for casual cruising and a million dollar old school look. For serious illumination look elsewhere."
1,SP62 Remington razor blade replacements,"This product ($7.63ea) DON'T work as a replacement for the Remington replacementblades. The blades in the unit need to be circular, these are ""crescent"" typeon top and don't fit tightly into the screen area and consequently don't cutyour beard."
4,BEAUTIFUL DRESSER,"FOR THE PRICE I THINK ITS WORTH THE THE TIME,YOU NEED TWO PEOPLE TO HELP WITH THE DRESSER.BUT I PUT IT TOGETHER BY MYSELF.I WILL SAY LAYOUT ALL OF YOU PARTS TO THE DRESSER AND TAKE YOUR TIME.YOU WILL NEED TO FOLLOW THEM CLOSE.IT TOOK ME ABOUT TWO HOURS TO PUT THE DRESSER TOGETHER,AND IM NOT A PERSON WHO NORMALLY WOULD PUT ANY THING TOGETHER LIKE THIS. BUT WHEN I FINISH IT LOOK PRETTY GOOD FOR MY FIRST TIME EVER PUTTING A DRESSER TOGETHER FROM SCRATCH."
1,ASSEMBLY REQUIRED,"This is perhaps the worst experience I've had in making a purchase on-line. Typically, I am very satisfied. However, this dresser came in a million pieces, requiring assembly. Had I known this in advance, I never would have purchased it. I would have returned the item except the cost would be too prohibitive due to the weight. I was trapped with the purchase. No escape."
3,Attractive but not very sturdy,"For the price this dresser is pretty good. The cherry finish wood matched the DaVinci crib that I had bought perfectly. The down side is that it does require full assembley, straight down to every knob on the drawers! The base of the drawers are a flimsy cardboard so you won't be able to put anything heavy into any of the drawers. I'm using mine for baby clothes and other light weight items so it isn't too big of a problem but just a heads up."
5,Fun and Adorable!!!,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas (I shop early). I haven't given it too her yet, but I had to try it out. The frog is too cute! Each of the accesories that he comes with has a little hard piece in it that makes the frog react to it. He sneezes or blows his nose when you hold the tissue to it, slurps soup off the spoon, etc. The only downfall is that the body of the frog is not that cuddly, but that is to be expected with electronic toys. I know my daughter is going to love this!"
4,Great reference for hikers,"This book is a wonderful reference for anyone who wishes to hike in Colorado. It has tons of information, such as types of trees, wildflowers, wildlife, camping information, first aid, trail guides, altitude information, etc. A ""must have"" for anyone wishing to take beautiful hikes in Colorado."
3,too much information,"The 40 hikes are so well described, you don't need to hike them any more. I can't memorize 5 pages of hike description, and I can't hike and read at the same time. I also don't need someone to explain what I see, if I can recognize it for myself when I see it. We didn't use it for a single hike - I recommend to buy it for the bad weather period when you have time to read instead of being on the trail"
2,Carriage Clock,"When I ordered it I realized it had Roman numerals but hadn't noticed they are lined up with the bottoms of numerals all toward center of clock face. This I guess is traditional as is the number 4 which instead of correctly shown as IV, it is shown as IIII. Five, six, and seven are all upside down. I realize that this may be traditional for a lot of clock makers but to me it just looks weird. The wood casing is very solid heavy wood and looks ok. The clock workings are in a plastic case and seem cheap. I didn't try it out so assume it works. I returned mine right after delivery.This seems to me not worth the money unless you really want a copy of a traditional mantle clock. I would prefer an old original one if I can find one."
5,Own it- LOVE IT!,"I bought this thru here, first thing I've ordered from this site & after getting it & having it, several months now.. I get so many complaments on it!! It really is a beautiful necklace & so worth it!!!!I work in the Fine Jewelry Department at JCPenny & honestly, you cant buy one of these at 3times the cost of this one, so know that its not only a stunning necklace, but at a cost you can not find in a store!!..WORTH GETTING!!!! SO WORTH IT!!!"
2,Will last for a year or so,"Ok bike if you got it for ~$150Bicycle will not last. Handles will wear off, gears will stop switching and it is so hard to tune it back. Plastic pedals are narrow and do not provide grip.Pros:Brakes are awesome even in the rainCons:Impossible to tune. Will stop switching gears properly."
2,An instrument with great potential,"I've owned an ETX-70AT for almost three months. It continues to frustrate me. I am a novice at astronomy, but I do understand technical matters and technical writing. I really want it to work and will keep trying.The scope optics are great. The Autostar controller software is awful. The instruction manual needs significant improvment. Scope alignment is difficult. Training the motors is essential, but Meade sent me instructions for another scope. A leg clamp on the tripot broke on the second use. The scope learning curve is long and steep.I've written a five-page letter to Meade describing my problems and suggestions. I hope Meade will address them..."
4,Works well for cleaning oxidation from my swords,"I have a Hanwei Raptor Katana, which I recently purchased, and it had some oxidation on it when it arrived. So I ordered metal glo, and polished off all the oxidative damage before putting Reniassance wax on it. The oxidation was removed quite well, but with a soft cloth, Scratches did not get smoothed out as much as I would like. I assume that if I were to put this with some fine grit sanding material I would get a better result."
5,The ultimate adventure guide!,"This is the most comprehensive guide to Sulawesi ever produced. Hundreds of pages of travel tips and dozens of lively articles cover every aspect of the island's history and geography, taking you to lots of fascinating and rarely-visited places. Detailed maps of each town and district of Sulawesi are included, along with personal recommendations from our authors on how to get around, where to stay, and how to get the best value for your money."
2,Disgusted in the Midwest !,Received the Makita RHP1501K 9/16 drill today. I have never purchased anything reconditioned before and never will again. I was expecting a Drill that would be cleaned up and look as if someone had took the time to check it. The chuck was full of sawdust. Sending it back - someone else might be happy with it.
4,As it should be,This was as it was pictured & explained in the buyer area. It is exactly what it said & was useful for my purpose.
4,"Item wasn't quite right, but DeWalt and Amazon made it right.","Excellent value, however when I recieved mine it was missing a dowell in a pivot point on the fence. I contacted DeWalt and without hesitation they sent me a whole new fence assembly. I told Amazon what was going on and they responded in a generous and satisfactory manner. As far as the tool goes it's a DeWalt, how can you go wrong?"
4,Eye Opening and Informative,"I knew that my knowledge of Latin America was wanting, but I had no idea how much I never learned in school nor received from the news media. Guillermoprieto does a solid, dispassionate job of explaining the complicated politics of Latin America and what it means for those countries and their relationships with other nations. The essays on Cuba and Mexico are particularly intriguing."
3,Self-titled 1983 album from Brazilian pop singer,"----------------------------------------------Ednardo""Ednardo""(EMI-Odeon, 1983)----------------------------------------------This is a reissue of a self-titled 1983 album by Brazilian pop musician Ednardo, originally released on the EMI label. The songs, all written by Ednardo, include:1 Super X2 Rockcordel3 Arraial4 Papai Mame5 Tudo6 Rubi7 Café com leite8 Encantado9 Nova raa10 Ponto de conexo"
4,"""A singular, mysterious book like nothing else""","Published in Holland in 1955, this has earned a lot of praise for being a singular, mysterious book like nothing else. It's the story of a Indonesian, Felicia, who returns from Holland to her native Indonesia with her baby son."
1,A big waste of time and money,It doesn't make sense... lousy.....a waste of time.....if you are very weird or in another sttae of mind maybe you would like it.
1,garbage on hot ******* ice,"I'd rather have a colonoscopy with a rusty shoehorn,ANDHave my home burn down with my pets inside,ANDWitness a spiders eggs hatch inside my own faceThan EVER watch another moment of this rudderless storyless garbage again.It featured the sets of 2001, the music of Apocalypse Now, and the plot of a Billy Mays OxyClean infomercial, with Billy pitching in his current condition. Porn has more plot and twists. Save yourself! !!"
1,Horrible,"Don't know how this movie got 3.5 stars. No plot. Very slow scenes. Horrible background music (sounded like somebody just discovered a Moog synthesizer and said, ""Hey! I think I'll experiment with this in a movie!""). If you really MUST watch this movie, do yourself and favor and put it on fast forward: you won't miss any dialogue and the action will pick up a little bit."
5,Imaginative Madness,"I enjoyed every second of this movie. It is strangely wonderful, visually epic, and the original soundtrack is a cosmic masterpiece. I hope to see more of Pano Cosmatos' on the silver screen"
1,"yeahh, let's shop...whatever!","I go to Tokyo twice a year so I guess my knowledge is ok. DVD starts from hotel Conrad but never mentioned are the prices--well, in my book prices go first and hotel name second. Tokyo designed quite practical and most shopping of any kind based around big stations like Tokyo, Ueno, Shibya etc and I mostly stay at Ueno as it very convenient to airport and Akihabara. And, in reality, Tokyo for a visitor starts from internet where we do research and when we land at Narita I buy me a pass for a subway which cost 1000 yen for two days but some routes not included. Each big station has multitude of hotels for any taste and price and Ueno is my favored. Any big station also has free map of Tokyo with shopping areas, subways and trains. Shopping in Tokyo does not start from Ginza as DVD suggests it starts from what you looking for--unusual stuff--in Akihabara, regular shopping--in Shibya, for young people--Harajuki etc."
4,Underrated gem,"I don't remember how I came across PJ, but wherever/whoever it was recommended it if you're into Beck.To be sure, there are some Beck similarities, but PJ also has his own voice and sound, and is in no way a Beck clone. Some of the songs are quite soulful. As an example, recently, I had the ipod on ""shuffle play"", and had to do a double take on the menu display, as at first, I mistook ""People"" for a Chocolate Genius song.There are a couple of throwaways here, but most of the record is mildly psychedelic, quite catchy, and very listenable over time."
4,What a Great Collection,"Bottom Line is, if you liked any of Frey's Material, this Collection is a great buy - do yourself the favor & get it."
4,Great Glenn Frey Collection,"This is a great collection of Glenn Frey's music. My only complaint is that I didn't like the ""One You Love"" being a live song. Otherwise this a great album for the GF fan."
3,"Pretty good, hey it's Glen Frey.","I bought the CD for Smuggler's Blues and The Heat is On. All the other songs that I can recall hearing weren't all that great, but I got what I was looking for."
3,disappointed...,"I like the Eagles, and Glenn Frey as a single artist. Although this was ""remastered,"" a few cuts sounded like they were the last prints of a very tired master. Plus the best song was a live cut, not the original studio release. Analog recordings are easier to master to SACD than digital--or so I've read. I really wish artists would push the record companies to put out hybrid releases that can be played on regualr CD players plus those that also play SACD discs. It's still a good listen, but a bit disappointing. Some instruments feel pushed down, like they are deliberately being suppressed vs. being let go. If you are a die-hard Glen Frey fan I guess you would purchase this, but after having it and hearing it, I would think twice. I gave it three stars based on the fact that he is a member of the great Eagles band, and is also good as a solo artist."
5,Love it and Glenn Frey,I love Glenn Frey (and the Eagles) so what's not to love about this cd. Could listen to this all day long. It has all the more popular hits by Frey and others that are less played but also FANTASTIC! Give yourself an early Christmas present and get it for yourself if you haven't already.
4,This is a book about when Mary Anne's dad marries Dawn's mom,"When Mary Anne's dad marries Dawn's mom,Dawn thought it would be fun having Mary Anne for a stepsister.But Marry Anne was driving Dawn crazy.So Dawn decides to scare Mary Anne once and for all!"
5,It 's the most fun for Zombie Fans,I just got this game 4 hours ago and i think this game is great its the most fun i've in a while on a game i think its way better than halo and honestly i thought halo was OK(by ok i mean good but i've played better) but not as good as everyone said but i might like this game more just because i'm a zombie fan and i'm also a fan of grossout and goofy humor but either way so far i've loved it
3,Best Zombie game ever!,"This game is so much fun because you get to be the zombie! You get to terrorize the city of punchbowl, eat brains, tear off arms, possess people, bowl your head, and so much more!!!!!! Plus the little clip videos are so cute. The only bad thing I would say about this game is that it was too easy to beat at first, but you know what? You can change the difficulty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So there is really nothing wrong with it. I wish there were more zombie games out there like this, but Stubbs is sure to stay a part of our gaming family."
2,So-so...,It's funny and cute for the first 15 minutes. Then it gets kinda boring. Do not buy at $50...wait 'till it goes down in price or rent it. You'll be glad you did. Far too slow paced for anyone over 12 years of age.
2,"So, So magazine","I bought this magazine subscription for my husband who loves Science magazines and I think he's been disappointed, as well as me. Not what I expected it to be."
2,I got this as a gift for a friend,I have a friend who wanted some magazines sent to him as a gift and this is one he really enjoys but he can't get it because the address keeps getting messed up. I have gone on their web site to change it but it still isn't coming to him.
4,Like good old times...,"For many years now I've been reading everything online. Low price and famous name has drawn my attention to this magazine. Delivered sooner than it was expected. Great articles. I enjoy reading the paper version of the magazine, being able to read it again if necessary. And I am happy to learn again something more than the private life of the celebrities and how to lose weight. I wish there was less advertising, but I guess, that's how the magazine is funded, so be it."
5,"Dewalt 705 12"" Miter saw",Tool looked brand new out of the box. This saw is a great deal. No blemishes at all. Great buy!!!!!!!!!
3,Would prefer Walnut Tradition,"I ordered these knives thinking they were the same as Chicago Cutlery's Walnut Tradition line, which has wooden handles and straight-edge blades. These Centurion knives are quite large, almost the size of boning knives, have black handles and serrated edges. They work quite well, but I would have preferred the others. I have used Chicago Cutlery products for many years and consider them excellent knives for the money."
3,OK. I am not thrilled,"I hate being the only one who doesn't like something. But, well....I am a curvey woman. Not fat. And actually the picture, without a body in it, looks like I thought it would look on me. And it does, and more. Because I am only 5'3"", I felt 'too' curvey. The dress did enhance all of my womanly attributes. But for me, too much so. It put weight on me. My waist is not long, and somehow the dress made it look even shorter. Instead of feeling sexy, I felt I looked like one of Cinderella's less lovely sisters.The one shaped like a bowling ball."
3,Whose side is he really on?,"Samir Horn (Cheadle) is a Sudan born Muslim (raised and trained in the US) who appears to have terrorist ties, or at least in the beginning to be some kind of dealer in explosives. Following his arrest and escape, we aren't really sure whose side Horn is on. How he struggles with his religious beliefs and his alliance to his country becomes central to the story. What I came to appreciate about this movie was portray of Horn as he struggled with his moral and religious convictions, and it is the dichotomy between these issues made for an interesting movie.I feel that Cheadle did a wonderful job with this role and anyone could benefit from watching this movie."
3,Not bad,"Don Cheadle put in a decent performance in this somewhat predicable drama. It is one of the latest movies in the ""war on terror"" genre.The effort to be sympathetic to both protagonist and antagonist ultimately undermines the ability to tell the story of either side. This is a drama that is pretending to be a documentary and it falls a bit flat."
4,"Generous size, lousy lock",The only thing wrong with this bracelet is that it keeps falling off the wrist. The clip design just opens all the time. They should have thought of something more secure.
4,Had extra links so you can adjust easily,The clasp was heavy enough and the length was long so you can adjust it. Its discription was right on
5,Superbly played works for bass clarinet and piano,"This disc consists of ten works for bass clarinet and piano. They're all from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. They're by Bozza, Semier-Collery, Krol, Kibbe, Rasse, Baker, Soll, Sluka, and Loeb. The disc also includes the sheet music for the Loeb and the Soll works, in PC and Mac-compatible CD-ROM format.If you don't particularly like bass clarinet music, I don't think you'll want this disc. I think the bass clarinet is a lovely instrument, and I like this album very much. Henri Bok is simply superb, and shows us what one can do with a bass clarinet. Rob Broek does a fine job accompanying him.If you play the bass clarinet, I think you ought to get this."
2,Disappointing,"Don't be fooled by the thread count--the duvet cover is not very comfortable. The only good thing about it is the big buttons at the bottom, so it's easy getting the down comforter in and out of it."
2,Must have tiny wrist,"No way could I wear this bracelet. The silver tubing is rigid therefore you better have a tiny wrist to wear this. Unfortunently, it was not worth the money to return it."
5,A Must Have!,I love this CD. I bought it along with their back to back CD and their Then and Now CD and simply love every song. I seen them in concert several times along with their little brothers and sisters and wonder when the Wolfgramm kids are coming out with one of their own CD's.
5,Ding a ling!,"We bought this for our 2 year old daughters bike and it is great. Cute picture on it, durable, and has a nice ding a ling too. Easy to attach."
2,Tisk Tisk Tisk...,"While this bicycle bell brings a lot of smiles from the looks of it, it quickly turns the smiles upside down once you start ringing the bell. We bought this for our daughter's bike, but it broke the same day. While you can probably get away with glue and tape to help, it's only a temporary solution.I would recommend spending a few dollars more for a higher quality bicycle bell. I felt terrible when my daughter came to me with a broken bell and I would hate for anyone else to have to go through that."
2,Cute bell but breaks easily,"I bought 2 of these despite the reviews that said it broke easily. One bell broke the first day. It was easy enough to put back together. They have broke several times since then and I have been able to fix them every time, until the most recent one. Now the bell won't work. These are very cute but poor in quality. I would not recommend this bell and wish I would have found something else."
3,flowers,it is ok but not what i expect. i thought i have hints as to how to paint flowers but i just had patterns
4,Works but options are finicky,"First off, I do love the show Vandread, so this is not a review of the show itself but rather of the set (since the show would get 5 for 5 stars).The set is rather bare-bones, with the only options being English or Japanese stereo and optional English subtitles. Fortunately, all I wanted was Japanese with English subtitles (best way to watch it IMO). However, the setup to change the options is much worse than it sounds. I generally have to select my options 2-3 times before it actually works (not once so far through 2 playthroughs has it worked first try). I select the correct options but they don't properly work, such as having no subtitles or English with subtitles. That would drag the set down to a 3-star but you can watch all the episodes at once, so you only need to mess with it once per disk, but it is still a large nuisance."
5,from my childhood,was good to remember what I used to watch on Sat. mornings. Amazing to see Peter graves a a very young man
3,Smaller than expected,"The dimensions posted are incorrect. The actual dimensions are 8.6 X 6.4 X 1.1"" It led me to believe the product was a little larger than it is. It will serve my purpose, but I would have purchased the 7.5"" dish had I seen it first."
4,"Good, but I had hoped for more.",The DVD shows that it can be very easy to train dogs to be of assistance. I had hoped it would go into more details and show more techniques and different behavours.
2,Now come on...,"Not to be a Debby Downer, but I've been amazed at how many reviewers of this episode (both here and in the DVD reviews) actually like this episode! Ridiculous-er than usual aliens (complete with language that a Native American might speak in a John Wayne flick), Bones slapping his pregnant patient around (""I'll touch you in an any way or manner that my professional judgment indicates!""), bows and arrows (bows and arrows?!), and Kirk's embrace of revenge (""Why not?"") all add up to a bizarre mismatch that's too unsettling to ever feel worth watching. Immediately after this I watched the 3rd season episode, ""The Cloud Minders"" and felt a wave of fresh air roll over me, as I suddenly had issues, acting, and writing that felt, well, quality. Sorry, ""Friday's Child,"" but I won't be watching you again."
1,Advertise 4 Cartridges BUT send 3!!,"Epson Color Ink Cartridge Multipack (C64, C66 ,C84, C86, and CX6400 Printers) T044520Multipack is represented as a 4 pack (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow & Black) but I received a 3 pack (no black cartridge)...When I went to reorder, my account page states that I already purchased the 4 pack...if I send the first order back, are they just going to send the wrong item if I reorder! I guess I'll just go to WalMart because I can no longer wait for printer ink!"
1,Epson ink clog problem,"I have used a cx4800 card reader,scanner, printer combo for 3 weeks. After 4 consecutive days of no use, prints were streaked, like horiz. striped shirt. Blue and black are clogged, and running utility many times improves, but does totally cure, the problem. Shows ink at 70-80% all colors, 60% black. I have bought NO NEW carts, so these are absolutely factory EPSON cartriges.If you have to run utility every time you want a quality print, even if it DID work, that's no bargain.Recomend: avoid all Dura ink printers until they get ""dry head"" bugs out of ink formula/heads."
3,What can I say?,"It's Epson ink. I buy it for my Epson printer. I don't want to pay these prices but what choice do I have?One of the great scams of our time- printer ink. It's INK, for god's sake, not a computer chip!Rant over. The ink is fine."
2,ifffy at best...a hangover movie,"Not exactly Bergman territory, a movie to watch when you're not thinking much. A real HANGOVER MOVIE. Understand it was the inspiration for hit tv show ""Hello Larry."""
5,"Good Product, I'll Explain Why","These are better than others because-All metal mechanism. The little lock button, the rod inside, all metal. I've seen other brands where the push-button/lever is plastic. I've had stuff, metal stuff, even, break inside my carry-toolbox, when I was going somewhere to do some work. I would certainly not buy tools with plastic mechanisms on there.In short, these are built well, and I recommend them 100%."
5,Victorian gothic adventure,"This novel probably fits into the Steampunk genre of science fiction but it is so much more than that. It is a compelling read written to a very high standard; the words wrap you in a darkly brooding Victorian world that is engrossing and at times will tear at your emotions. The atmosphere it evokes makes me think of scenes from H.G.Wells, Tolkien, Philip Pullman. Not a light read but I recommend it highly to anyone who likes good literature, atmospheric writing and a tense adventure tale."
5,works good,"it work good,I have 5 different copier's I use and love all of they.It was a good price and helps alot,I would buy another one."
4,great for cooking,"I use these for every recipe that calls for small measurements, such as 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Easy cleaning too. Really easy to break though, one drop and they break."
5,My favorite new gadget,"Truthfully, I bought these mini-measures because I thought they were cute, but they have become the most used item in my kitchen. I use them daily. I can't even explain how easy some of my recipes have become."
2,just learning,"This is not an easy language. this course would be great if you are refreshing your knowledge of this language. This course moves from learning the alphabet and how to speak it, directly into conversation. The book and audio do not follow each other consistantly. If you are a beginner look for something for beginners."
1,Bad Bubbles,"absolutley terrible. first of all the plastic is really hard to squeeze out.it takes 4ever to get the plastic on the straw and then when you blow it, the plastic pops before the bubble even goes up. but i think the plastic is fun to play with by itself. it looks like gashes when you put it on your skin. the only thing this product is good for is a halloween/april1 joke. do not buy!!!"
1,broke on day 1,"the handle broke, the teeth on the short comb were unusable, the teeth on the long comb were ineffective, waste of money,"
1,How cheap can you get??,"Came online tonight to pick up a vertical stand for the PS2 my Hubby got me for Xmas. But, come on!!!! $15.00 plus shipping and handling, not to mention any taxes? At the cost of this machine, Sony is really scraping the bottom of the capitalist barrel not including a round plastic disc with a slot or two in in it with the System. Shame, shame, I know your name!!! I'll just stand the thing between a few books or something. For $15.00 I'll be getting another game. And I will not be jumping to buy anything more from Sony, either. Feel like I am being ripped off, as in the old days when ""upgrades"" and new systems meant kissing all your old games goodbye!"
2,Just slightly more useful than the horizontal stand...,"...But that isn't saying much.Standing your PS2 vertically is a great idea if you're in need of some extra room. In fact, it was designed with this intent in mind. IN FACT, it stands upright perfectly well on its own, and even better so when leaning against your TV, some CDs, or books. So why is a product designed to save you space take up almost twice as much room as a bare PS2 while serving no useful purpose whatsoever?'Cuz it looks cool, stupid.If you need the extra space that you're hoping this stand will free up, then chances are you already plan to put it between some books or against your TV. How making it two times as wide as normal helps you accomplish the task at hand is beyond me. Even more baffling is that Sony expects people to dish out 30 dollars for a piece of (BLUE!) molded plastic. The sad thing is, people will."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,"I have a PS2 and it's been standing up fine, even without the stand. I have played the PS2 upright ever since I got it, but I haven't noticed a singe scratch on any of my disks. My advice is, don't waste your money!!"
2,Don't see the point,"I don't own a PS2 (yet) but i've rented one from blockbuster a couple of times for 5 days a piece. In those ten days I have stood the PS2 unit vertical for all of them, all 10 without a stand and have had zero problems with it.I don't own the stand, but when i get my PS2 i'm pretty sure i'm going to spend the money on a game rather than on a stand..."
4,great but overpriced,This is great and makes the ps2 look a lot cooler. But it is a little overpriced. It should be like 5 to 10 dollars.
3,Alert!! Unpleasant heroine ruins otherwise good book,"What is going on in the romance world lately? All the heroines are nasty, mean-spirited witches (or something that rhymes with witches). This book had great possiblilities. Fantasy and good fun, but ruined by my constant amazement that such a great guy could possibly be interested in this unpleasant woman. Come ON authors. Your seeming desire to create ""independant"" women is NOT working. It's surely possible to be strong and independant, but missing the nastiness factor. Let's go back to women with character and heart.If you didn't like the female lead in J.A. Krentz's ""The Pirate"", you probably won't like this one either. By the time both of these women became decent human beings, who cared. Certainly not me."
4,STARRY CHILD,Enjoyed this story very much. It got me hooked on the series. Can't wait for the next book to come out!
1,Honey is Sub-Par,"This honey was quite unlike anything I had experienced before. The flavor had a pervasive bitterness to it, unlike any clover honey I had tasted in the past, and I could only describe it reminiscent of extremely over-brewed tea. It made me cringe. Its odor also had a certain disagreeability about it; there was sweetness, yes, but it was accompanied by a faint chemical smell like that of petroleum.Pieces of honeycomb could be seen suspended throughout the honey, which I suppose at least tells you it is authentic, but they are not very pleasant to bite into... like a sticky yet dry piece of shoe leather---impossible to chew through.Avoid this product."
5,Finally a reference guide that weighs less than 20 pounds!,"Diagnosed with a number of psychological disorders at a very young age, I have been prescribed medication after medication. I soon found myself wanting to know what it was that I was taking. I trusted my doctors be feared they may have overlooked possible side effects or interactions. I have used the full sized PDR along with the Genarics tomb as well, books both very heavy and overly complex for someone uneducated in medicine. Now, PDR: Drug Guide for Mental Health Professionals has alowed me to quickly cross-refrence drug interactions and saves me the time of having to sift through medical jargan to find the information I want to know and can understand. A great buy!"
2,needed more than this book had to offer,"I found this book of limited use because anyone dealing with prescribed medications in the mental health field is also usually dealing with someone taking other medications- for pain, sleep, GI distress, etc. So having a book on only mental health medications has not been that helpful to me. It is worth getting a more comprehensive book."
1,Watch out for rip-off,"I received my order of replacement earpads as promised, but to my great surprise, Maxi Aids (the real seller here) tacked on a hefty shipping & handling fee. When I placed the order with amazon, there was no mention of this - not until after the order was placed and unchangeable. This is a huge rip-off to pay more for s&h than the product itself."
2,What a pill!,"""Zen and the Art"" is one of my favorite books of all time -- exquisitely focused and balanced, a fascinating exploration of intellectual high ground with compelling human interest.Pirsig should have left it at that. ""Lila"" is a rambling, shapeless polemic. Page after page, chapter after chapter of navel-staring diatribe, it is the work of a person who has spent far too much time in his own head. After about page 300, I found myself losing patience with it and skimming over the ""Metaphysics of Quality"" spew, in search of something resembling a plot line. (The only thing that keeps this review at two stars rather than one is that a plot line does indeed exist, if you're willing to sift through a mountain of repetitious opining.)Pirsig should have heeded the final lesson on Quality from his first book and never written his 11,000 index cards. Or ""Lila."""
2,Treatise or Fiction?,"If this is fiction, it lacks all the necessary ingredients: plot, character development, forward movement, and crisp dialogue. If this is a philosophical treatise, the ""examples"" are oddly formatted. As I slogged through this, I felt like a ball being volleyed between one player wielding a tennis racquet and another holding a badminton racquet, over a net that was constantly being raised and lowered. What game are we playing here? I actually like both philosophy and fiction and there are several authors that manage to combine them subtly and seamlessly (Andrews, Castaneda, Donner. and Villoldo being some authors that come to mind). In the case of Robert Pirsig, my perception is that the strength of his writing is as an essayist philosopher and shouldn't be confused by adding the fictional element."
3,Commitment Phobia,"After ten years or so, all that stayed with me was the main character barely being able to wait for Lila to leave, then once she does, he fantasizes about the wonderful life they would have had together, and how he could have ""helped"" her. This is a perfect example of what is popularly referred to as ""commitment phobia.""Also the name ""Lila Blewitt"" sounded like something out of a Thomas Pynchon novel. She had potential but she blew it?"
2,For new netadmins only,"Netmax Firewall is fine if you are a new network administrator (allowing it to protect you from your own worst enemy: yourself), or if your boss feels better with something in a box that says ""Firewall"" on it. And it's definitely way too much for home users who don't have a dedicated firewall server.There's a nice-looking but sometimes confusing web interface that lets you configure NAT (Network Address Translation) with one or more ethernet cards, and configure the firewall too. It can also let you monitor what your LAN users are doing, what websites they are visiting.But Netmax's simplicity becomes its worst feature as you start to learn more about network administration. In the end, you find out that you could just as easily have used RedHat and ipchains and gained more versatility, and then ftp'd some network monitoring tools if you want to watch how your users are using your net connection.In the end, Netmax becomes just a ""more expensive than RedHat"" RedHat distribution."
5,Please publish this again!,I loved this book as a kid. I am now pregnant and I would love to read this book to my son. Hope it will be republished by then!
2,Disappointing and sloppy,"This is a review of the KINDLE edition.I read books to escape the everyday. I dive into other lives and other worlds, and come up for air after an hour or more. That's how I like to read books. Total submersion, no interruptions, a private time, almost like a little vacation. When I picked up this book for free for my Kindle, I expected it to be a full version, edited and ready for readers. After the first few pages, I found out that it was not. I was constantly jarred back to reality with incredibly numerous typos - an unbearable intrusion into my zen of reading. Time after time, almost on every page, the same typos appear throughout the book. ""hi"" instead of ""in"", ""mad"" instead of ""that"", and so on and so on. It is so obnoxious, it makes it impossible to really get into the book. Very, very sloppy publishing. Shame on you, Harper Collins."
3,They needed to hire an editor!!!,"This book is a fairly good read but with the amount of typos in it, it makes it difficult to read at times. Good thing I got it for free!!"
2,Hour of the Hunter,It took awhile to get into this book. The other problems is there is a lot of misspelled words. The words are something not even close to the word they want there so it was very confusing. I wouldn't recommend this book to my friends.
2,Terrible editing ruined the enjoyment!,What were they thinking/ Just throw the book to together without editing. I decent story but ruined by terrible editing.They should apologize to us.
3,lots of time differences,"Book was ok, not my favorite. lots of going back into the past and then back to the present time. would have liked more of an ending. if you enjoy Indian history, you would like this book. also had several misprints which sort of threw me."
2,Just Ok,"I didn't like this book very much. It was very scattered, jumped all over the place. I kept trying to figure out whether i was reading about the past or the present. Plus there are a lot of typos. Once you get about 75% in it becomes interesting but you can skip the middle of it completely. I'm glad it was free. I think I'll stick to the Beaumont stories, much better."
1,Don't waste your $,if you are a firefighter or emergency responce worker then you might want to get this book but if your not dont spend your cash. This book only goes into common commercial and military explosives and does not go into detail about anything other then there physical appearance. the only good thing in the book is the last part when it goes into detail on how response teams should react to possible explosive threats
2,Too runny,"When you apply the product, you must work fast to spread it around your face because it slides off your face so quickly. I expected it to stick better. It does the job though, if you work fast. It has an oily feel to it, and lubricates the face well."
5,whats it worth,i would like to know what you sold this jersey for? i have same one want to know its worth.
3,A good addition,"--A usually funny and differently slanted approach not found elsewhere. I found this not sufficient for basic touring. It is short on some how-to and on pictures to identify/remind you where you are. Still, its light weight, half-inch skininess allowed me to carry it for its better writing style, and seemingly deeper, readable content."
5,Amazing,"I still hear this song get dropped a few times a month at the raves I go to. They never play enough of it though. It's in Dom & Roland's classic unmistakeable style, its got about a 2 mintues beginning portion, then explodes into the song all the way where the grinding buzzing bassline comes in with the ""punish me, me, me"" samples. A bit lighter and less frightening than his usual stuff, it's quite fun. And on the cd you get the extra 3rd track which is a great track too.Too bad all these D N B cd and vinyl singles are $10 imports, but its worth it"
1,low budget,"Not sure why I decided to buy this dvd, but I love hawaii and pretty girls so I figured why not. Upon watching, I discovered the production quality isn't very high, the models are ok, and the background music isn't good either. I can appreciate whoever put this video together but ultimately it's lower budget and not very well-made. You're better of with an SI swimsuit video or one from maxim. Pretty disappointed, sorry guys!"
2,Help,Can someone please let me know the length of these cables? Should be listed in the description but I didn't see it.Grass-E-Ass
2,Good deal for price,"Good deal for the price. If your looking for a lightweight vest to conceal your firearm, this is NOT the vest for you.."
3,"Nice vest, but in warm weather not recommended to wear....!","This is a good vest... it comes with even more pockets than advertised; however, in warm weather this will be really hot on you!!Maybe Im exaggerating, I live in SouthAmerica and here is really hot, so I regret having bought this because I feel really hot when wearing it!! It gets better to wear in fresh weather!!"
3,Product description INACCURATE,"After having to return a 12-piece Chicago Cutlery Centurion set because the Amazon picture was not accurate (not the same storage block), I ordered this 7-piece set. The description for the 7-piece set on this site, as of today, specifically says that it includes a bread knife. There is NO BREAD KNIFE. Instead, there is an 8"" slicer. This is not a packaging mix-up; the knives listed on the box are all included. Amazon simply has an outdated product description."
4,Works..sorta,"Well for the price this isn't bad. Super simple to sync with car.. instructions were very easy to understand. So the ""lock"" function works 95% of the time..the ""unlock"" only works 5% of the time which is the only downfall. But having the lock work is good enough for me"
4,Cute but VERY small - too small for us,"This is a cute little vest, but boy it is VERY SMALL!We bought this for our 5 year old twins that are on the thin side and weigh 35 lbs (within the weight range of the jacket). But when it arrived, we almost laughed. It is VERY SMALL. Looks like something you would buy for an infant, not for a preschooler. The tag hanging on the jacket says they come in 3 sizes:infant (0-30)child (30-50)but inside this jacket was printed: infant/child (0-50).Anyway, it is cute, but very small - I can see putting a young child in it, but not a 5 year old."
4,Sure Toddlers want to go kayaking!,"No one wants to drown their grandchild, so the only option is to get better quality flotation gear. I bought this for a 3 year old. . . no one will let me put him in peril yet, but likely it will still fit when they do!"
2,A great laugh,"Written by a total bible-thumper, it's a great laugh if you believe it. This book repeats some of the silliest rumors, like the ""priest with an erection"" rumor about The Little Mermaid-- long discredited. The section on Disney's secret homosexual agenda is especially silly. Fun for a laugh."
1,Only ill minds can find all this things in Disney.,"I really think it is silly to try to find this things in Disney movies. Hey, why should we think that because Disney talks to us about Olympus, he is against the Bible! That was just a story! Who is aware that Scar acts like a mannered character, probably homosexual... Please, be serious! As per the movies which are not cartoons, some are intended for adult audiences. And some are very good, even though the author of this crab book thinks they are offensive. Priest and Exotica are good movies, but then again, they are just movies, for instance! Well, all of the examples cannot be regarded to as things agains Disney. I really love Disney and hate this book. THat is."
2,"If you are looking for the bad, you WILL find it.","As both a Southern Baptist and a former Disney employee, I have conflicting views, but what lots of prayer and God's love has come to tell me is that when you wear rose colored glasses...you will see pink. Good, honest Christians will not take to heart most things in books like these because they are too busy finding ways to help their fellow man, witness, worship and tend to their own and their family's spirtual needs. I don't always agree with Disney, but they are far from a tool of the AntiChrist. Lighten up people!"
4,tough book to write,"Rubel Shelly is a detail man. This can be seen by reading this book. This is a very detailed book and well done for the difficulty of the title.Jesus has many names (Mighty Counselor, etc) and Rubel gives an explanation of these names. That is about it."
3,Difficult but interesting reading,One can see Russell's ideas in many later writings (uncredited--and that includes some scientists who appear to have gotten their ideas from Russell). But the reading requires concentration and some scientific background
2,Ok product,Do not see any improvements or changes with my hair since using the product I have very long blonde hair. It does smell great!
3,Not Made in Japan,"Do not expect the lens was made in Japan, it's a good filter just to protect scratches."
4,recommendable book,"This is an interesting and readable book, but mainly concentrated in the yearning & admiration of Northern Europeans for Italia et Graecia. I was expected from the title a more comprehensive survey-book on the mediterranean male/male love relationships ."
4,GOOD,GOOD NICE INTERESTING GOOD PRODUCT FILM MOVIE SHOW WORTH A FEW VIEWS AND MORE GOOD FOR KIDS AND FANS ALIKE OF THE SERIES
1,Cheap,"I purchased this filter and realized that you get what you pay for. As other people have said, use this as a lens protector then anything else. I shot some pictures that have a glare and others that turned out alright. I am looking forward to getting a new glass filter instead of a cheap plastic filter."
2,Fire the editor and do a re-write!,"Like others posting reviews, I can not fully enjoy any book that is jam-packed with mistakes. Blatant spelling mistakes repeated several times just chip away at an otherwise interesting compilation of facts about J.K. Rowling and the HP books and movies. The Multiple choice format could possibly be fun for a gathering of HP fans but was sometimes annoying when trying to flip forward and back between the answers. I'm rating it two stars for interesting content but horrible presentation."
2,Not what I expected.,"I guess I should have expected it with this title. But, I didn't learn much new or interesting. I felt it was pretty much a waste of money. Sorry."
3,"Excellent book, but...","It wasn't what I was looking for. If you want a quiz book to test your knowledge of the Harry Potter books, this is not your item. This book focuses on minutae of interest only to a Fandom Fan -- about the movies, stars, JKR, and the books to a lesser degree. It's DEFINITELY trivia of the highest degree, but not a good test of a devoted reader."
5,Awesome Info on GOF MOVIE 4!,"This book is amazing. The added information and details author Daniel Lawrence has uncovered about GOF Movie 4 is awesome for anyone who is a HP fan or sleuth. Author Daniel Lawrence is probaby recognized as the most knowledgable HP companion writer and now i know why. Each page is loaded with tons of details and insights into Potter characters and facts, especially GOF Movie 4! I loved the trivia challenge questions!If you need to know everything about Harry, this is the best companion book I have found to assist you. As most HP web sites highly endorse this book, I do too. Great book."
3,Linear Filter!!,"Please be aware, although this is a linear filter, it does not say so on the website. It will not work with an auto-focus camera. So get a circular polarizer (Cir-PL), which is more expensive."
5,So handy,I have 2 kids under 6. These covered bowls are so handy for at home and out and about. The only problem is I keep losing them!
4,"Great containers, great price, animals are printed on exterior of containers","I really like these containers namely for their size & being BPA free. I use them to pack little snacks,veggies/fruits (baby carrots, grapes, raspberries...) in my daughter's lunch. She is 6 and in Kindergarten, I didn't realize (or notice in the picture) that there are little animals printed on the exterior of the containers. She mentioned that they kind of looked like a baby cup. Once you put the food it, it's not as visible. Just an FYI, as this was not in the description of the product."
2,fell apart,"This filter fell apart on me after two uses (and I used it VERY delicately). Attempting to remove it, a piece of metal popped off the inner ring, spreading a kind of grease on my lens, now the filter can't be attached to the lens, very sad."
3,Hoya Circular Polarizing filter,I used this filter with sunlight. The effects was not upto my expectations. I got the product from supplier very quickly.I am happy with their service
2,Can't get it off...,"The filter is fine, but when I screw it onto a B&W UV filter it jams and I can't get it off. I must put both in the freezer for a few minutes in order to get them separated. The ambient temperature makes no difference. Tried to save a little money and now I regret it. Should have bought the B&W."
4,Good filter!!,"I always had a problem that the pictures that I took were flat. The sky does not look blue and grass was not green at all. I keep reading about the this problem on many websites, and the solution was - a circular polarizer filter. I found the best circular polarizer from Hoya on Amazon, and ordered the same.This weekend, I tried this filter and I really liked the results and the sky was bluer, and most of the colors are crisp. I will recommend this filter for instant results."
5,my boys like it,"my boys are 5 and 6 and they love the series.gff hgmjgym jhgjhgmv hvh jhg,jh jhg b j b"
5,Magic Tree House-The Knight at Dawn,Have you ever gone on a adventure? Well in the book The Knight at Dawn is about a boy and a girl Jack and Annie and they go on adventures. Jack and Annie look for a magic tree house and when they find the magic tree house they clime a latter that is connected to the tree house. Then they look for a book that is opened and they wish to go there. Then the tree house starts to spin... I n this book Jack and Annie go to a castle and get thorn in the dungeon. If you want to hear the rest you should read it your self.My favorite part was when Jack and Annie escaped out of the dungeon and into a river. It is my favorite part because when Jack lands in the water he freaks out. I think that is funny.I would recommend this book for second grad to 5th grade and you will always remember when you read it. NOW GO GET THE BOOK.
1,Possibly the worst textbook of all...,"Unless you are wanting to be completely confused and write poor HTML, don't buy this book. I have used the 2nd edition (same author) and a friend's 3rd edition. They have so many typo's in the code that some of it doesn't work. E.g., It doesn't always ""quote"" the attribute values in HTML coding tags as you are supposed to.3rd edition, Tutorial-4, Case-1, gives step-by-step instructions to create the example web page, but with code that does Not exist! What is this code: < td width=""200"" bgcolor=""back4.jpg"" > ?? Is it for the background color or an image? Which is it!? It can't be both!So in closing, this book is extremely poor and confusing. Please ask your school to quit buying this series of programming books.If you want to learn competant HTML quickly and learn it well, use the free online tutorials from www . w3schools . com. Because this group of people created HTML and there are sure to be no errors."
4,One Of My Favorite Girl Kiss-A$$ Film,"Zoe does an excellent job in this film. I love the action, and the fight scenes are realistic. This film did not receive the attention is so richly deserve. Which is too bad because it rings right up with my other favorite female action star, Angelina Jolie's Salt.I always like Zoe's work, however this film put her over the top. It was nice too see a woman of color play the lead in a fast-paced action flick, instead of the girlfriend, the best friend of the lead actress, or the woman in distress.Zoe keep up the new work. Amazon customers, give this film a chance. If you like action-flicks, you will not be disappointed.P.S. Little Colombiana was amazing too..."
2,Poorly written action flick,"I found myself losing interest in the story half way through. I let it play out while I did more important things on my laptop. Not terrible, but not very original or captivating either."
5,Action Packed!!!!,I really enjoyed this movie. It's action packed and keeps to on the edge. I really like the cast and the storyline. I truly can say this is a great movie. I recommend this to all.Colombiana (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]
3,I Am So Torn,"How do I rate this thing???Pros-Exciting - definitely action filled.-Saldana is physically built perfectly for this character.-The scenic shots are great in my opinion, even though the shots are from Mexico, France and the U.S.Cons-Everyone speaks English, when its clear they should be speaking Spanish-The plot is so ridiculous you comment out loud things like ""OH COME ON...REALLY?""-Saldana isn't given enough to work with script wise. They clearly wanted sexy shots, not oscar winning actingSome movies are so bad, you have to walk out/stop the dvd player before it's over. This is not one of them. You'll be able to stay until the end with no problem, but you'll be thinking ""THIS IS SO BAD"" the whole way. If you want to stay in on a cold winter night, order a pizza and rent a dvd with friends, this is the movie. If you're looking for a serious action film, this will make you mad."
1,"terrible film, one of the worst action films.","I just show half hour of it. The screenplay is for laughs, especially when the young heroine as a little girlstabs in the hand the bad guy who murder her parents. The whole film is a joke. Bad ugly actors and the wholething was to common and multi used cliche. Stay away."
5,AWESOME,AWESOME SICK MOVIE. Zoe Saldana is amazing and this was a great film. The power and courage exuded by Zoe was great
3,Violent...but riveting and unusual,"I liked this movie b/c it is not the norm...Hispanic female in an unconventional role and she kicks...__________!!!! It was like Girl w/ Dragon Tattoo (Norway) , Bourne, MI, and others of this genre all meshed together, but the unique twist of the female protagonist. I liked it. Not for those opposed to violence, so be warned."
3,Worth a dollar to rent for sure,"I'm kind of glad I didn't see this in theaters. It had great acting, locations and some fun action. However the movie had me furrowing my brow every time there was some ridiculous coincidence ie: the postman at the police station recognizes a flower. It doesn't do anything that other movies haven't done, but comparing this to man on fire is going too far. Man on fire didn't have me wondering how growing up with thug uncle gives you spy/assassin powers. It was cool but I was constantly taken out of the story by 'that couldn't/wouldn't ever happen' moments due to bad writing. It's worth a watch, but not more than once really. I'd have even rented it for a few dollars. Cast is great, writing is 'meh', 3 stars. They included a romantic side plot that went no where, I'm still trying to figure that one out. I'd say its on par with Aeon Flux, minus the sci-fi aspect."
3,"Okay, could have been much better","If you like action, this will entertain you for a couple hours. I didn't connect with the characters, it seemed rushed and glossy. I think there was a good idea, but the writers just didn't bring it together, something just seemed off/missing.On the good side, this movie didn't have any of you typical overly used one liners or comebacks. If it had, I'd given it a 1.5. I gave it 3 stars because it does entertain without making you look forward for it to be over.The action was creative, and as always Zoe is easy on the eyes.I can think of many worse ways to spend 2 hours."
4,Better than expected,"You never know what you will get in a movie about a 90 lb girl kicking around alot of large angry men and not even getting scratched. All in all, this movie was entertaining with good characters."
3,I Am Cuba,"The guy from NY is very right. On the other hand the Dr. has a very ""communist oriented"" thought. The Bay of Pigs was not a terrorist attack, and although I do agree with the fact that schools are not teaching with enough information on subjects like these, I do realized that the Dr. picked up the wrong books or he was told different otherwise. And my friend in London obviously was taken to the wrong part of La Habana. If you want to enjoy the black and white cinematography, you know very well that's going to be the G-spot.That is just my opinion!"
5,The Eye-Opener Movie That The Cuban-Americans need to watch,"This movie is a masterpiece. Ever since the first time I watched this movie I made it my favorite of all time. There's a great direction work by Kalatozishvili, excellent acting, and amazing camera shots. And last, but not least, the plot was a real eye-opener for me about what happened there, in Cuba, and then I understood how silly we all have been, just for letting the Cuban-American community to try to confuse us. I think that all the elements fit nicelly and that this movie has been really underrated, because I believe it should be considered as one of the great masterpieces of the cinematographic world"
1,Wait For A Criterion Release,"This is a review of the appalling packaging of Milestone's re-release of ""I Am Cuba"" only. Of course, the film itself is wonderful, and the new transfer and sound quality are a improvement, but not significantly enough to throw out the original DVD release in order to buy this frustrating package.As another reviewer noted, the three DVD's are encased in wafer-thin snapcases which will not hold the DVD's in place securely. Thus, during shipment, some or all--as has been my experience twice!--will become unattached and the playing surfaces will be very badly scratched. As the eye-catching box is huge, it begs the question as to why regular snapcases weren't used. They would fit.Anyway, if you do not need or want the two bonus DVD's--which are definitely worthwhile features for true ""I Am Cuba"" enthusiasts--save your money and wait for a Criterion Collection edition. Until then, hang on to your earlier Image/Milestone edition."
3,Visual Stunning Ridiculous Message,"""I Am Cuba"" is a stunningly photographed piece of pro-Castro propaganda. The film simple minded message US capitalist are evil and the Cuban revolution is good is explored in a series of episodes. The photography is amazing and its ironic how beautifull Havana looked then to the disater it has clearly become."
3,Heads-Up on this Item - It is not a Circular Polarizing Filter,"Luckily, before completing my order, I dug deeper into the technical description (down 2 levels) to discover this is a Linear Type. This isn't a problem if that is what you want. The Item Name and first level description is misleading."
3,Worked well but heavy,"I recently took the product to Europe and it worked great. It was, however, a bit bulky and fairly heavy."
1,Does NOT fit 04 Camry,"Despite Amazon's assurances to the contrary, this does not fit my 04 Camry SE - the plug is the wrong shape and the cable is actually about 6 inches too short to reach..."
5,Connects Blackberry to my 2005 Passat car radio,"My local VW dealer pulled the radio for me so I could access the back of it. Next I cut a small hole in the glove compartment to feed the cable to the back of the radio and presto, my Blackberry now feeds over 3,000 tunes to my car radio.It took about 30 minutes of fiddling but works like a charm."
5,VICON-C REVIEW,"Vicon-C was prescribed to me by my physician. Although the price is a bit high compared to other brands of vitamins, this one really works."
3,Sander,"I read the other reviews before buying this. I am a general contractor with over thirty years of experience. I bought this for working on my own home; didn't expect commercial results. It takes some getting used to and it isn't all that versatile in close quaters, lots of chatter if you move it just the wrong way. It doesn't have enough square inches to properly sand a seam, but then if you want that kind of machine you pay the big bucks and buy the Porter Cable. For what I paid it was worth the money, it will also sand floors which is a plus."
5,This rocks,"They are NOT copycats. The same person who produced S Club 7 and the S Club Juniors is the same person who made the American Juniors. His name is simon fuller. He created S Club 7 and S Club 8 and American Juniors. so they aren't copying the man owns those songs and is letting the 3 groups he created sing them. Whether you like it or not. He created the show S club juniors, american juniors canadian idol pop idol etc. So those are his songs and he created those groups. It's not the like the S club 7/8 own those songs. S Club 7/ 8 and the American Juniors were all formed by the same man. so shut your mouth. Other than that these kids are talented and the cd is worth buying"
1,Exploitation,"All I really have to say is that I think this is a disgusting display of exploitation. While these kids obviously have some singing talent, they are way too young to be used like this. They'll make a little bit of money off of this(and given the shrewdness of the industry, it will probably be very little), and then they'll be forgotten. This and all of those Kidz Bop records is just an attempt by people like the ones who run Jive records to draw a younger crowd into their pop world, thereby assuring themselves a new generation of consumers. I mean, why do you think all they do are cover songs? It's so that kids will move up to the older singers who recorded the originals."
3,FINALLY RELEASED AND WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT!,THIS CD PRETTY MUCH SUCKS! THERES ONLY THREE SONG THAT I LIKED AND THEYRE ALL REMAKES! LIKE HAVE YOU EVER. ORIGINALLY DONE BY S CLUB 7. AND THEY SOUND SO MUCH BETTER. AND LOVE AINT GONNA WAIT FOR YOU. ONCE AGAIN SCLUB 7 AND YES S CLUB SOUNDS BETTER. AND SUNDOWN. THE S CLUB 8 VERSION (THE ORIGINAL) IS ABOUT 100% BETTER. THE AMERICAN JUNIOR VERSION SOUND LIKE A WATER DOWN VERSION OF THE SONG!
2,"Far From a ""Complete Education"" in Physics","It is extremely misleading, in my opinion, to state on the cover of the book : ""A complete education without the tuition."" This book is far from a complete introduction to even the most general Physics I course. If you want a good introduction to physics without having to pay for a course, or even spend $100+ on a textbook, then I would recommend : Basic Physics : A Self-Teaching Guide--much more comprehensive. For a simpler approach to some of the fundamentals of physics, then I would highly recommend A Cartoon Guide to Physics."
4,Early Buddy Guy!,"The title of this CD is somewhat misleading in it's reference to the ""Best of Buddy Guy"" since ten of the eleven songs featured here were recorded between 1960 and 1966. The only exception is 'Talkin' 'Bout Women"" which was recorded in 1970. What you really get here are arguably some of the best songs which Buddy recorded for Chess in the early days of his career. While all of the numbers essentially feature Buddy's fiery guitar and strained vocals the last song ""Talkin' 'Bout Women"" features an early collaboration with Junior Wells were Buddy plays an acoustic guitar and Junior sings and plays his harp. If you are looking for a ""Best Of"" CD you are going to have to look elsewhere. Overall, a good historical reference on the early career of Buddy Guy and some pretty good covers of some Willie Dixon materal."
5,early days,"thus is a collection pf the early days of buddy guys blues days.this is all pre 1990,there are songs like let me love you baby and my time after awhile that where covered by tommy castro and stevie ray"
4,Speakers are working well,The only concern that I have is that the vendor is not listed on Infinity's site as an authorized internet vendor. The vendor indicates that they are.
4,Good but not Great,"Another fine recording made by Hahn since her predecessor of the Beethoven. As usual, Hahn makes everything seem easy, polishing her performance with more adroitness than ever. But also as usual, Hahn lacks enough emotion and intenstiy in areas, one part being the chord theme in the first movement. It sounded that Hahn was more concerned on intonation than making all the chords as one phrase and idea. In the third movement, Hahn did not portray her thoughts into her violin enough. This should be very different from the first two movements. This should have a ""Gypsy"" tone but Hahn played it as if it was the finale of the Mendelssohn. Overall, nice work!"
2,"Tepid Brahms, Odd Stravinsky","Brahms wrote the greatest romantic violin concerto. Szeryng and Monteux understood it. Perlman and Guilini understood it. But neither Hahn nor her conductor understand it. The Stravinsky, on the other hand, is very good for three of the four movements. However, the third movement drags as if Stravinsky's concerto needed a dreamy adagio. It doesn't, as Stern's recording with Stravinsky illustrates."
4,Bargain rubber lens hood for medium telephotos,Helps prevent lens flare and glare. $3.49 is a great bargain for this standard collapsible screw-on rubber lens hood designed for medium telephotos with a 72mm filter thread. It'll cost you twice as much anywhere else.
5,Excellent movie for all,"This is not your typical Disney fare. It is MUCH BETTER!! A wonderful story for children and adults about ""the book that turns darkness into light"". I recommend it for all. The fact that the story is historically true is all the more reason to love this film."
5,Great Movie.,"This is a great movie with beautiful artwork. Every frame in this movie is pretty. The story is alright, but that's not why I purchased this. If you like animated movies, then this movie is a very good addition to your collection. I also like how it comes with DVD and Blu-ray. I will probably watch it again after getting a bluray player."
1,More bombast from the moral majority,"I wish I had the rose coloured glasses that Mr. Parsons has glued to his head. Polyanna lives and breathes as we speak. To read him parroting the same industry lines that have been heard for 40 or 50 years is disappointing, but given the fact that major oil comapnies in collusion with the Detroit big three have funded his ""research"", we should not be so surprised.I would guess that big oil companies fleeing the myopic denial of a problem by the Global Climate Coalition is evidence that there is no problem at all."
4,What size is this listing?,Do we have to guess at the dimensions of this product? I cannot seem to find them listed here.It looks like the size is now listed.
4,Tough but packed,"This book is a collection of the writings of a 17th century Dutch theologian whose ideas set Calvinist predestination on its ear. Written in the scholastic style of the period, it is rough sledding for the modern reader, but demonstrates the thought of a man who was intensely committed to biblical Christianity, in contrast to the orthodox rationalism of his day."
2,Lavender & Lace,"This CD had romantic quitar music, very soothing, but not what I would call sensual. I returned it."
1,No Signal,"This is the second time I bought this model and it is the second time I am returning it. It NEVER received a signal where my old Emerson CKA1000 Atomic Clock Radio used to be (and received a signal just fine there). The old CKA1000 finally got Alzheimer's and finally died after about 5 years of dependable service. The CKA1100 is certainly not up to it's older sibling's performance, at least the atomic signal antenna engineering isn't.Some day, atomic clock manufacturers will invest more engineering efforts in their antenna technology so customers can put a clock ANYWHERE in their home without restricting it's placement near windows or outside. When people buy clocks they have a specific place they want them and nowhere else. This was the case for this clock and it unfortunately had to be returned.Unless you're using it outside or near an open window, skip this clock."
1,Product didn't work-,I understand that this might not be the fault of the seller but it doesn't work on either my computer or my wifes computer. I might as well throw it away.
4,Very sorry this product was discontinued,"Very good product for my long curly hair-just enough softening without weighing it down. I understand they changed their bottle and have a new product line with a higher price, maybe I'll try it."
4,A good first book on financial principles,"I read this book three years ago and though most of its content seems to be common sense. I was amazed at how little I actually knew about financial matters. I saw myself clearly in some of the characters, as I too was living beyond my means, and had no plan for retirement.The book's narrative style makes it very readable (and there are not many financial books that can make that claim). It will not tell you what to invest in, or how to make a quick million. What it will help you do is set a solid foundation for your future. I am happy to say that I have finally freed myself of high interest credit card debt, and am now beginning to invest in mutual funds. I owe a lot of my initial impetus to reading this book. The principles in this book should be taught in highschools around the country."
3,"I loved this book at first, but. . .","When I frst read this book several years ago, I loved it. However, I like to go over my library of personal finance books to get a little shot of encouragement when I need it or just for some info I might have forgotten. After going back to this book, I couldn't get through the silly story again. It just did not go down as well on the second helping. The story and the characters get old very fast. Skip this one and buy the automatic millionaire or the total money makeover instead."
2,"Interesting first half, trash the second","The beginning of this book, where the main character discribes her childhood in turn-of-the-century Jaffa, is very engaging. She slowly learns and spells out the family secrets that help her understand who her mother and grandmother, and of course who she herself is. The relationships and discriptions as related to the plague and riots were very well done.However, the book goes off on a sexual tangent after the girl leaves home. The sex obsesed, religion hating character that fills the second part of the book has little relationship to the first half. The only reason you will plow through this part is to learn the final secret of the grandmother.The religious dessecration is wholy unnecessary and very disturbing. There are parts of this book that left a very bad taste in my mouth, thus prompting me to write this review. I will never pick up another on of her books."
1,Only talking + No illustrations + Sketchy details.,"This volume 2 is bad. It covers children's common medical problems.The doctor just sits and talks non stop. He does show a summary table for each problem. Each of them is covered very briefly. It's better to read a book about this subject. It's because the book has illustrations and more details.I junked this DVD. Luckily for me, it cost me much less than the rental fee of a disc"
4,Kathy Smith - Timesaver Lift Weights to Lose Weight 2,"I really love this workout. It's easy to follow and is presented in 10-20 minute increments that allow you to fit the workout in to a busy schedule. My only complaint is that the DVD cover indicates that there is an ""exclusive 20 minute stability ball workout"" included when there is not. Unfortunately, I bought 2 stability balls to go with the 2 DVDs I bought (one for me and one for a friend) before I discovered this. I have sent 2 emails to customer service on the Kathy Smith website and have received no reply...very disappointing."
3,Less Than What I Expected,"I am a real fan of Kathy Smith. Her cuing is always clear and her movements are not too ""dancy"". In addition, she typically presents helpful and effective exercise education in her workouts. While this was true in this tape as well, I was a little disappointed in the quality of her routine. It appeared more personal and less scripted than most of her other routines, but the energy Kathy usually brings to her workouts (even the yoga workout tape) seemed to be missing in this one. It had a bit too much ""infomercial"" approach for my taste (a complaint I also have with some of the other popular workout names).That being said, there are helpful moves and good information in the workout, and I will continue to use it."
5,Six of the ten tracks are awsome!!!,This album has I think 4 songs that were Top 40 singles when they were released and a couple of others that should have been.Worth the bucks in my opinion.
5,Maturity is the goal,The author's use of tables and charts is very helpful as well as his thorough examination of the subject. I found fresh information for my personal research to guide my continued growth as a person.
3,Nice concept...,"I really like the concept of this dvd: 7 different daily practices for your week with options to add on for mornings when you have more time. However, Shiva is very difficult to follow. She will be telling you to do one thing, but when you look at the screen she is already on to the next pose. When you combine segments, they end up feeling disjointed. This is not really aimed at beginners, yet even advanced yogis could find themselves frustrated by the poor cueing. All that being said, Shiva is beautiful to watch, the music and setting are nice. She offers her own creative take on vinyasa flow...it's just not for me."
4,Matrix difficulties,"This is the first Shiva Rea DVD I've purchased and I enjoy the practice, I even share it with my yoga buddies on our weekly workout. We find the poses & speed of the workout to be intermediate level with a couple of advanced moves. We cannot get the 20 minutes matrix feature to fully activate and work on any of our machines. I'm writing the Mfg. to see if an exchange can be arranged. If that were turned on properly I would give this DVD workout 5 stars."
2,"OK Routines, Bad Cues","The routines I've done so far on this DVD are ok, and I like the way you can choose a pre-determined routine or build your own. BUT... The routine names make no sense (""fire"", ""earth"", ""water""...) so you pretty much have to find one that suits your preference by trial and error. Also the instruction frequently uses the sanskrit names for the poses, so unless you know them, you will find yourself constantly twisting your neck around from whatever pose you're in to see the screen so you know which pose to move into next. This kind of ruins the practice for me because I frequently don't know what to do and get frustrated at having to constantly look up instead of just flow through the poses. The cues are also not always in sync with what the instructor is doing so sometimes I feel like I'm falling behind.If you're very good at yoga and know the sanskrit names, you might really like this DVD, but otherwise I'd recommend finding one that's easier to follow."
3,Growing on me,"I have done this with the lesson sets that she created. As stated by someone else, she tends to move into the next before telling you to do it. This left me to wonder how the heck she got from A to B a number of times especially since she miraculously ends up at B. There is limited instructions. She usually tells you to go into chataranga or some other yoga speak pose without guidance on the proper way, or things to ensure to make sure you do the pose right. Once I got used to the different classes, it was easier to follow. But, I still need to watch her alot. I have done all of the matrix matches that she did. The matrix is a cool idea for someone that wants independence in designing their work out or just do a short work out, but there is a break between lessons since each lesson can stand on their own"
3,Not for Beginners,"Had heard good things about Shiva Rea so decided to try Vinyasa Flow to help work out some kinks and provide more flexibility. While I like her presentation and soothing voice this is NOT the DVD for quasi-beginners. I've done standard yoga and like Rodney Yee for relaxation, but if you're not familiar with Shiva's style this video may leave you wishing you'd picked something else. There's no prior instruction and she transitions through the poses so fast there is barely time to try and figure out what the previous move was. My doc even said 'no' to this video for me. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't have a user friendly return policy on DVD's so I'm out $20 and left with something I can't use."
4,Yoga for real,This video has several different classes and combinations of classes. It is a smooth and graceful flow yoga that really helps the body. She is amazing to watch. You can do 20 minutes or 120 and any where in between.
2,Not a good teacher,"The purpose of this DVD seems more to show how wonderful and beautiful Shiva Rea is, but not to teach yoga. It is hard to follow and, while the matrix format itself is great, it feels repetitive."
5,Hedonism Handbook,"An entertaining read containing a lot of very funny material but,on another level,a lot of good advice for maximizing the quality and quantity of pleasure we can draw into our life.A great gift for friends who need reminding to stop and smell the flowers.Abook to keep on the bedside table!"
1,Packing and Shipping items from Amazon,"I ordered this book and a Kindle on Sept 22, 2010. The book shipped on Sept 25, 2010. But it must be on a flat bottom boat from China! The Kindle, well they have been packing it for over three days now. I may possibly get it, this time, next year! I have never been so disgusted/disappointed with a company as I am with Amazon. This is the last order I will ever place with them!!!! I'm considering just returning both Items and be done with them."
1,Where is Dottie,I bought this thinking i would hear the outstanding voice of Dottie Rambo. I feel tricked. Dottie generally doe snot solo on this recording. I would almost this that they did not own the rights to sell her recordings. The songs feature Buck and reba. I loved the voice of Dottie and thought she would be the feature singer - but bot on this album.
1,Not 2 cups,I wish I had seen the review that said this is not really a 2 cup measuring cup. If I had I wouldn't have bought it. I needed a two cup measuring cup the shape of this one. I have a plastic one but it is getting worn from almost daily use and the marking are almost gone. But even if you fill it all the way to the brim it does not hold 2 cups and of course who wants a measuring cup that you have to fill all the way to the top to get the full measurement. Generally you want a little room left at the top when you have added the desired amount of whatever you are measuring so it doesn't spill if you have to carry it to the stove or wherever. If you truly want something that measures 2 cups don't get this item.I will never purchase a Dezine product again. If they think selling an item described as a two cup measuring cup when it doesn't hold two cups is acceptable then I can only imagine the lies they tell about their other products.
2,Markings come off,"The markings on my glass have almost completely disappeared. Granted I used it a lot and put it through the dishwasher almost daily, but after only about 3 months, the markings started to fade drastically. The one redeeming feature is that the glass is thick and sturdy."
4,Where's Gary Giddins?,"This a valuable book. How could it not be with more than 800 pages and contributions from such exemplary jazz writers as Gunther Schuler and Dan Morgenstern? But how much better a guide it would be if it also included articles by our best jazz critic, Gary Giddins. I strongly recommend Giddins's Weather Bird and Duke Ellington as supplements to this volume.Ben Sonnenberg, New York"
1,dónde está mi pedido,no me ha llegado mi pedido aún Tengo dos pedidos realizados con fecha de entrega del 12 y 18 de diciembre respectivamente Quiero saber dónde están mis solicitudes
5,A superb introduction for actors and audiences,"This book is a must for serious students of acting, for critics and for audience members who wish to understand the basics behind great acting. Focusing on late Stanislavsky theory - meaning less on the state of being than on the action of doing - Bruehl clearly sets out the actor's task in jargon-free prose and with a precision that makes the craft approachable to all. For too long, the craft of acting has been steeped in mystical hogwash, rather than acknowledged as a learnable trade. Granted, knowing the craft will not automatically make one a first-rate actor. That still takes talent. But Stanislavsky and others have found a means of teaching this craft and training future artists, and now Bruehl can be added to their lists."
5,"Great quality, price and delivery","I bought this wrist rest and another and love them both. Way cooler than the photo shows, very comfortable, and terrific price. Can't imagine life without these now."
1,"too much talking, not enough visual","I was hoping for a visual guide on how to DO first aid techniques that would be appropriate for middle school students. Instead, it is all lecture, or conversational with very little real examples."
1,Didn't meet expectations,"I ordered this scale for a blind senior citizen. The English speaking voice has a British accent and is difficult to understand. The scale wobbles when you stand on it making you feel unstable, especially for someone with impaired eyesight."
4,Gel Knee Pads,"These knee pads saved my knees. The only problem I had was that I had a hard time keeping them on my knees, they would work up off of my knees."
2,Poor kneepads,"These are not really very good. I bought them based on the reviews here, and I don't know what people are thinking. I don't install floors, but work a lot on my knees. My old pair of HD ones gave up so I got these.After wearing them for a half hour I was wanting to go dig the old ones out of the trash. Here is why they are lame1. Strap is too tight (short). I may be 10-15# overweight, but I am not obese, and not a body builder. However the straps only just fit, so there is not much Velcro overlap.2. Bunch up in back of the knees, yes all kneepads do this but these are as bad as any, and with only one strap they should be better. The strap is wide and made out of some padded stuff and this only makes it bunch up more.3. Rolly polly I could not stay on the pads. I was working on a low slope roof and I kept rolling off them. Like I said, this is not my first rodeo, so I am used to wearing kneepadsJust my 2 cents"
5,Knee Pads,I love these gel knee pads! I recently had a knee injury and was concerned about getting all my flower gardens planted. These are really comfortable and protected my injured knee Very well. Would highly recommend to anyone.
2,Undersized,"I made the mistake of thinking the print was as advertised 24x32, it is actually undersized. I bought poster frames to match the advertized dimensions and of course they don't fit. Art.com gets no more business from me."
3,Aldin 8530P Garbit 3 piece screw remover,"Tried removing old 3 inch deck screws but the screw remover bit wasn't able to grip/hold and turn the screw. The screws were in composite wood which is harder to remove than if the deck planks were wood. Tried another brand/design (craftsman), but had the same problem as with the Alden bits. I liked the design of this product, and feel confident they would work well with shorter & smaller screws. This was the first time I tried using the screw removers."
1,Non Grabbing .. Grabit?,"Have a couple stripped out 2"" wood screws in some hardwood furniture.. and my Lowe's no longer carries the Kobalt Tap outs I used to rely on.. so I tried one of these things..Package made it sound simple enough.. use the ""Burnishing"" end on the Screw first, to create a nice surface for the extractor end to grab into.. that seemed to workBut when I tried to get the extractor working.. it actually stripped the threads on ITS surface.. so the wood screw is a harder metal than this bit.... failAnd yup, I ran the whole process using the drill's reverse direction.Took that one back to Lowe's and just to make sure it wasn't just an odd fluke.. I bought their multi Bit pack.. and tried 2 different sizes... same results... NO luck.Would not recommend these."
5,Workhorse paper is customer choice,"This was the paper that was used in my photoshop class at a local community college. I now have customers, and I have prepared a print portfolio so that the artist could choose the paper that she liked best. For this portfolio I printed the same photo of one of the artist's paintings on my new Canon Pro 9000 Mark II on five different papers - Illford Smooth Pearl and four custom art papers from Canon. The customer choose the Illford print as the best representation of her work. Quite an endorsement for Illford Smooth Pearl!"
5,Perfect low gloss paper,"I have been using Epson's Ultra Premium Photo Paper Luster with my Epson 3800. While the low gloss is satisfactory, the weight of the Ilford paper is slightly higher. I find that with the Epson paper I get a slight ""waviness"" that isn't present with the Ilford. It's the perfect paper for the very slight amount of gloss I prefer to a matte paper.If only they made the same paper in a 17 x 22."
4,AB's Rule!,"I did not buy the book as I decided against getting an American Bulldog. No offense to AB devotees but I want a dog that does not require constant vigilance for fights at dog parks (even with lotza prior socialization), and a wariness whenever the dog (on or off a leash) approaches another canine. AB's guardian instincts outside the house are not for everyone."
5,Pyrex Accents 4-Piece Bakeware Set,This Bakeware Set is outstanding. I bought 2 sets as presents and my friends who received it were ecstatic about the bakeware.
1,"No Good, Thumbs Down","100% useless - I originally ordered this anchor for my size boat. When it arrived it looked very small but figured it was so high tech, it didn't need to be larger. Well it took forever to hookup and it was never a solid hook. I then re-ordered this one, which is the largest size available thinking it just needed to be larger and heavier. Horrible again. Save your money!!! My Specs: 23' boat, North Atlantic (NY), sand and rock bottom. Failed miserably on all bottoms. Couldn't even snag it in the rocks."
2,Fluid mechanics for mathematicians,I would not recommend this book for any introductory fluid mechanics course because there are a lot of derivation steps as well as background information assumed by the author.This is more of a mathematical approach to fluid mechanics as opposed to the more classical engineering approach.
5,Great product,"I love this hammer, no problems with it! Sturdy and great for the price. I have hammered at some tough rocks and it is still holding up well."
5,happy in missouri,"one of the best Tom Petty albums ,seen him in concert when this album was released around 1976 or 1978 have the album and cd but lost it had to buy another one i have most of his albums , seen him like 10 times in concert"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD SET!!!!!,This thing is a total rip-off. It has nothing to do with Nevermind. It is not an authorized release. One of the DVD's is about In Utero and the other is a complete waste. Nirvana does not appear and their music is not used. This DVD was previously released as a box set that I mistakenly bought. Now they slap the Nevermind 20th Anniversary packaging on the same terrible DVD's and sell this turd repackaged. I only wish I could give a zero star rating as it does not even merit getting one star.
3,Error in temperature range,"Though I have not yet purchased this (or any other) LPG detector, I noticed that the SafeTalert web site states the operating temperature range is not 32 degrees but minus 32 degrees. ""Operating Temperature -31F to + 150F (-35C to +66C)"". (...)"
3,"Good replacement, wrong model","The reason for three stars is because description stated, and picture showed, surface mount, but item came as flush mount. The original had been flush-mounted but we wanted to install the replacement in a new location that would require surface mount. Rather than return the new item we installed it in the original location. Installed easily and used crimp connectors for the 12-volt DC power. According to manufacturer and technical articles the gas alarm and carbon monoxide alarm should be replaced five years from the date stamped on the back. This one was over a year old when installed, but you can't really check it without uninstalling it enough to read backside."
2,Disappointed,"With the cover and description of this movie was 'hyped', because the movie was rated a 2 star......boring!"
2,PRETTY EMPTY HOLE,"This is another one of those scientifically inaccurate/implausible movies that tries to be soundly scientific but eventually caves in on its own silliness.Somehow, a black hole has shown up in the middle of St. Louis, and some kind of electrically charged entity hitchhiked a ride and is now threatening to decimate the city, and possibly the world.The movie's pretty lame in all categories with cheesy special effects and bad performances from Kristy Swanson, Judd Nelson and David Selby. It makes little if any sense and its resolution predictably unimpressive."
3,disappointed after washing,I was disappointed after using my knife for the first time then placing it in the dishwasher with the rest of the dishes and my steak knives. When I removed the knife the next morning I noted some rust spots on the blade. Good sharp knife but hand wash it and dry it immediately.
4,A Glimpse of the articles of a previous age,"Lynn Hunstburger has given all car enthusiasts and collectors a leg up by collecting and indexing many of the ornaments you are likely to find at swap meets, auctions or on eBay. I use it often in identifying U.S. hood ornaments at the San Diego (CA) Automotive Museum. The book would have rated five stars except for some errors and no page numbers. When identifying an ornament for someone I always have to add ""Regrettably there are no page numbers so I cannot be more specific in the location in the book other than BUICK or FORD or LINCOLN Section"". The errors in my 1994 edition (the NASH [broad winged]Flying Lady misidentified as a 1957 item when it was a 1951 item for one) can be forgiven; anyone who takes the time to do a research project this extensive can be expected to err occasionally. The errors will undoubtedly be corrected in the next edition. Thanks to Mr. Huntsburger for a an excellent piece of work."
5,great gift,My sis in law is on her feet all day working retail and really enjoys this when she gets home.
2,This was disappointing,"This was disappointing. I was excited that you could heat it up, but you can hardly feel the rollerball inside that is supposed to massage your foot. I think the only way you could put enough pressure on it to be effective would be if you were standing. I was looking for something to use under my desk at work, and this was definitely not it. Save your money."
5,AWESOME!!!!!,"This book is the greatest book ever written..........I not only give it 5 stars, but its 1 Billion stars...This book is highly interesting and very exciting. I would buy a 100 copies and give them as gifts to your friends or familly....I would even buy it for a complete stranger........also, Mrs. Herran is a great teacher!!"
2,not what I payed for,"I did not receive what I ordered. It was not a Honeywell product, but not worth returning since it was only $10 and change. Great scam by Amazon."
4,No problems,I ordered these filters for my humidifier. They fit & worked just as the filters did that came with my humidifier. Nothing special to report on these filtes.
4,Filter was not as pictured,"Ordered the older type of honeywell filter, (without the blue ""antibacterial layer"") because reviews of the modified filter were not good. The picture does not have the blue cover, however the filters I received did. Seems to be performing fine."
2,You'd better buy the original Honeywell HAC504,This competible HAC504 is thiner than the original Honeywell HAC504 so it is less efficient and wasting power. It is cheaper than the Honeywell brand but you will pay more power bill.
3,how to make them last,"The only way to make these filters last is to flip them everyday. We live in an area with the hardest water possible and the filters go hard in a month. I wash it weekly in detergent and cut off any any hard spots.However flipping really prolongs life,currently at 2 months and counting. The filter is still quiet soft and appears to have lots of life left."
2,Doesn't last long.,"The Honeywell HAC504 is a typical wick ""filter"" that gets full of mold and dirt in a matter of weeks. This replaces the Honeywell HAC529EX which had a UV treatment that killed mold, never got dirty and was $5 cheaper. I'm still on my original HAC529EX from 1997 and it's still humidifying our basement dungeon."
1,Horrible stick. Won't work for any purpose.,"It sucks. Four of the action buttons also function as a d-pad, making any game unplayable with this thing. I wouldn't use it if it were free; you're better on a normal dual shock controller."
5,Birdy Buddy,"My conure loves these snuggies. He snuggles next to one each night, then unties it and crawls under it during the day. Unfortunately, the product has been discontinued."
3,not a mariah fan,"bought this one for a friend on her b dayshe flipped out when she opened it , apparently it is a hard find"
3,Mariah,This is an older technology (DVD) and once one experiences Bluray it's all over for everything less. But I still love Mariah.
2,Not useful for improve your game,"Is not useful for improve your game since can be interesting for some mathematics who likes bridge game is not useful for bridge player in live game, you can not use your calculator machine in the table!!!!!Is a curiosity book, i dont recommend it for improve your level."
5,Great paper - good price!,"I have used this paper before. I rated it some time ago as the best photo paper for the price I have used. Excellent reproduction of colors. Heavy weight - better than the paper you get when you order enlargements online or at a store.The colors may not be exactly as you see them on your monitor, if you have not profiled your monitor. But they're close. Colors are epecially vibrant on this paper. And the Smooth Gloss Paper is less expensive than other Galerie papers."
4,It works for me,I've spent a good portion of my life in photography and related fields. i appreciate Ilford Galerie paper for delivering a high quality print from an inkjet printer comparable to color prints made by traditional methods and with relative ease and moderate expense.
5,She has done it again!,With each listening her albums all become more remarkable. This is no exception. A truly amazing singer/songwriter/performer. She covers the emotional spectrum. She has numerous other albums available from Canada.
5,Thoroughly enjoyable,"Although my understanding of french is limited, I thoroughly enjoyed this album from the first time I played it, and I haven't gotten tired of it after perhaps a dozen or more plays. Has a happy, pop music feel, but isn't boring like a lot of pop music. I'd say it's my favourite french album over the past year."
4,Amanda Pig and friend Lollipop have fun together!,"My kindergartner has recently discovered the Oliver and Amanda Pig books and loves them all. The stories are interesting and engage my daughter's attention. She also loves readers which are illustrated, and this book contains colorful and cute illustrations by Ann Schweninger. This book contains four charming stories centering on Amanda and her best friend Lollipop as they have playdates, a sleepover, etc. Young children will easily relate to these stories and the charming illustrations enhance the text. Beginning readers who have moved on from the level one readers will enjoy trying to read this book on their own or with some assistance. It also makes an excellent read aloud for younger children."
3,Emily and the Dark Angel,If you like Jo Beverly the book is worth the read. It is not up to her usual standards. This is a earlier book and she has definitely improved her writing game over the years. The character connections and the juicy passionate lovemaking was lacking in this book. It felt incomplete at the end but overall a good story.
5,Brilliant!,"I disagree. I thought the dialogue was excellent. I absolutely loved everything about this book from: the poignant love story of an embittered duke hurt by a woman he once loved and his twin brother and a beautiful french heroine you cannot help but cheer for. To the exquisite sexual tension between the h/h when they must team up to find the duke's wayward brother--also Olivia's scoundrel of a husband.The passion simmers just below the surface as the duke realizes his brother's wife is the one woman he can never live without.The love scenes are steamy and the emotions are palpable. At times, I found tears welling in my eyes because I could feel their pain. Very well done and a definite keeper. I highly recommend."
4,humanity at its finest,"This book really has little to do with Catholicism. What is does cover is compassion and love....in other words, humanity. Fr. Joe Devlin was a saint in the true sense of the word. Don't believe me? Read this book. If you ever wondered what the Vietnamese were thinking and feeling while the Vietcong took over their villages and killed their families, read this book. If you ever wondered what they thought of the American military, read this book. If you ever wondered just how much a human spirit can put up with without being broken, read this book. If you want to see the fight for freedom....the love of America....the desire to come here and be FREE....read this book."
1,Dissapointed,"Product was received damaged. I followed the directions on how to return by emailing the seller. All emails were returned undeliverable. I called the phone number and they were not taking calls, telling the caller to please email. I will continue trying but I just wanted to warn people that it has not been a pleasant purchasing experience."
5,More Than Just God's Soldier,"Father John Bannon was a Catholic priest who became the chaplain of the First Missouri Brigade in the Confederate Army. Like most chaplains, Catholic or Protestant, North or South, he ministered to his ""flock"" by providing spiritual sustenance and sacraments to his troops. But unique to Father Bannon was his passion also for the Confederate cause. In fact at the Battle of Champion Hill, he personally helped swab the bore of a cannon in a Missouri Battery in action against Union Troops when one of the artillerists was knocked out of action. His fearlessness under fire and willingness even to literally assist in combat endeared him to Confederate troops. Father Bannon's name is not well-known, which makes this one of a kind biography unique and a significant contribution to Civil War scholarship."
1,Item Pictured Not Item Received,"The Acme Siren Whistle ordered THREE TIMES and received & returned to Amazon THREE TIMES was not the item pictured. The whistle pictured was ALL metal and those received had a plastic neck (as per item being reviewed) and not the ALL METAL whistle I ordered and paid for. Upon my money being returned, I plan to contact the Acme Co. to order the proper whistle. I will also advise Acme that Amazon.com, as well as their provider companies, are doing an inferior job of representing Acme. Disappointedly, William M. Ray"
5,Favorite Yoga Video,"This has become my ""Go To"" yoga DVD when I travel or can't make it to a yoga class. I love Zuzana's calm and comforting instruction. She offers the perfect direction and guidance necessary at just the right time. She makes flow yoga fun!"
4,Great fun lite warm up/workout,"Best, most fun workout for my post ankle ligament tear recovery. Found Hemalaya on Fit TV & got frustrated when unable to suit their schedule/airings. Very glad to have at the ready whenever I can workout now!"
1,A totally limp experience,I bought the 2007 making of the Du Stade French Rugby Calendar and the making of the firefighter calendar together and you cannot compare the two.I suggest you get ALL the French making of Calendars before you waste your time on this.I am very disappointed in this dvd.
4,The Little Steamer That Could,"This humidifier is smaller than described, but it is effective at its job. I use it in a medium-size bedroom, where I find all the windows steamed up in the morning; the moisture even reaches adjoining rooms. If you set it on high for a couple of hours before bed and reduce it to low, the tank will easily last the night.This product is quiet and easy to clean since it is basically a water cooker and have no moving parts. My only gripe is that it will occasionally gurgle when water is being taken up, but I've gotten used to it."
4,"Great Performance, Small tank","Look, the thing is going to work as good as any other product priced over $80 or $90. But the small tank is disappointing: It is not going to last the whole night, Is that simple. In our case, I got it for my wife, and it is capable to keep our 12x16 master bedroom humidified without problem. It is not noisy, and quality wise is good. Did I said it has a small tank? I tried to ""engineer it"" to see if I could add an attachment or something, but really you can end breaking the container, so I wouldn't go there. If you don't mind only getting around 4 to 5 hours per tank, then this is perfect for you..."
4,Decided to Like It,"Indecision is a highly enjoyable book for all 20 somethings who still have no idea in hell what to do with their life.IT's sitting on the shelf next to ""ExtremelyLoud and Incredibly Close"""
3,Twenty-five novels in one,"It's a coming-of-age novel! It's an unrequited-love story! It's an incest story! It's a drug story! It's a corporate story! It's a September 11 story! It's a travelogue! It's a socialist manifesto! It's got a plot twist! In other words, there are way, WAY more things going on here that can be coherently contained within one slim novel. It starts out fairly tight, but thematic elements begin to pile up alarmingly and the plot structure unravels to such a degree that it almost seems the author decided, halfway through, that he actually wanted to write an entirely different book altogether... one completely incompatible with what he already had down on paper. That being said, it's frequently laugh-out-loud funny. For that alone I can't judge it too harshly."
2,A series losing steam,"When Joan Hess began writing the Maggody series, I found them hysterically funny. I hadn't read one in years when I recently picked up this book. The jokes seem stale, and the characters more two-dimensional than I used to find them. The stock characters are all there, they haven't changed a bit. Maybe, for me, that's the problem."
5,Towel or Yogitoes?,"I prefer the Yogitoes towel over a regular towel. It is a must for Bikram Yoga or Power Yoga. It is easy to clean, just throw it in the washer and dryer."
5,Perfect towel for Bikram Yoga!,"I love this HUGE yoga towel/mat. It covers lots of space & keeps my hands/feel off the gross carpet at some Bikram studios. Eash to wash, durable, and very well made. Very happy with this purchase!"
5,SLOW SHIPPING,"Although the genuine Shure N78S styluses were what I expected them to be and worked great, the shipping time was very, very S-L-O-W."
1,"Poor quality, then failed, and discharged my battery","Poorly mechanical design. The screw-in wire connectors are weak and sloppy, making it impossible to achieve reliable connections (I had to solder directly to them). After about 2 months, I noticed the charger had failed and my 12V marine battery had been discharged to 10.5V."
1,No breakdown/explanation of movements.,"I have used other beginning Tai Chi videos/DVDs--and I was still lost using this DVD! His movements are beautiful and fluid, but there was no breakdown or step-by-step explanation of how to execute the forms. My learning style is such that I need a sequential presentation of movement and a clear explanation of what body part is supposed to go where, and where in the body I would feel the work. This contains none of what I need as a kinesthetic learner. If you are able to watch and do, then this could work for you. If you need small bits of information at a time, then this will not be helpful. I passed mine on to a friend who practices karate."
2,not great for beginners,"maybe its just me but i found this extremely difficult to follow, i've never done tai chi before, i'm expecting right now and someone recommended it to me. the guy has a very soothing voice and the music in the background is relaxing but i had no idea where to put my foot or my arms, he just went through and sort of narrated what he was doing. i think if you have taken classes, and already have the fundamentals down, this could be very helpful. if you haven't, i can't say i'd recommend it."
1,Not enough explanation for beginners,"I give this DVD one star for Chen's wisdom and explanation of Tai Chi, in the bonus section and introduction. As someone who has never done Tai Chi before, I was excited to try this, and the price was right. But the explanations are just flat out missing! What am I supposed to do with my hands, other than mimic the instructor? Which foot gets moved, from the ball or the heel? Disappointing. I like a DVD where enough instruction is given that I feel comfortable not watching the screen after a few practices, I just go off of the audio cues. But with this, I am never going to get there. I was considering the Scott Cole series, and I should have stuck with that."
3,"It is a ""Wrist Strap""","It is a wrist strap but a nintendo strap still fits but different adjusting piece and dose not lock, and not white its gray, but for 0.35 can't really complain."
2,Poor readability,"This publication attempts, with good intentions, to provide a complete overview of Controller Area Network, but lacks the basics of good and comprehensible writing. The technical information on the CAN standard is mostly solid and provides some interesting details, but also contains a number of incosistencies and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Rather than concentrating on CAN alone, the author(s) decided to include sections on higher-layer protocols such as CANopen, DeviceNet and others, which are too detailed for a quick overview, yet by far not sufficient for someone who needs solid information. Also, the author(s) apparently did not invoke the process of proof-reading before publishing their work ("
3,Basic Information and not all in the WSJ,"The book is a light introduction to economics. As such, it is interesting and it does lead you to some of the more obscure corners of the WSJ online (for which even print subscribers must pay a subscription fee, plus another for Barron's online).A big problem, however, is that a majority of the interesting charts with historical data are drawn from sources other than the WSJ. In addition, these sources (such as the US Census Bureau) provide only the raw data, not the charts."
5,My favorite episode!,"The fact that there is no review applauding this episode bothers me. This is the episode that introduces us to all the Vulcan history which has become so well-known. ""Live long and prosper"", the Vulcan hand jesture and the famous music people like Eddie Murphy and ""the Cable Guy"" imitate are all from this episode. If you consider yourself a Star Trek fan in the slightest then you must own this episode."
2,Have read much better,"I've read the Left Behind series, and other escatological fiction books. Some good, some bad (though I disagree with the pre-trib theology, I can ""get past that"" for the sake of good entertainment). To say that it took me a few weeks to plow through this book is generous. I first had difficulty with the editing, misspellings, etc. Then, though the story progressed, I found myself thinking that though I can certainly imagine how difficult it must be to write a Biblical fiction novel, there are those who really need to have someone critiquing their work -- someone not related by family or friendship; I think Jon is one. I found many aspects of his book difficult to reconcile with Scripture. It wasn't a *bad* book, but I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone"
5,ri-DICK-ulously hilarious!,"I had a feeling that I would be amused, but I had no idea how hard I would laugh. This is the funniest movie that I have seen in years! What makes it so entertaining is that it's not just one type of humor. There are puns, there are bizarre visuals, there are... I couldn't finish that sentence because I remembered the huge amount of nudity. If you can understand it, the abundance of nudity is itself hilarious. Girls get naked for the most absurd reasons. I can see how a movie like this would upset a person who's dense. But if you've got good comprehension, expect to get a sore throat from laughing so much."
4,T-max 400 speed film,"This film is great. It is good for many situations and is very flexible. You can pretty much be safe with 400 speed film. It is an average film that will allow for low/bright light subject matter. It is good for outdoors. Good travel film, since you don't always know what the weather will be like. Have fun!"
2,Disappointing,"It gives some of the basic facts about the western cowboy though the cover and overall presentation is misleading. While the American cowboy remains at the center of the book, enough coverage is given to international cattlemen to technically make this book about cow herders of the world, and not about American cowboys per se.Had we wanted a book on cow herders of the world, we would have looked for one, but of course, we were looking for a book on American cowboys.Add to this the problem of the DK staff editorializing the book with many unnecessary opinions, and the book was very disappointing indeed. (Opinions on women being ""condemned"" to wear skirts, legal guns making the west more dangerous, and the oddest statement I've ever read, that cowboys wore their boots in the fashion that they did because of how proud they were of their small feet?. . . )Odd statements, and unnecessary and controversial statements aside, the book was worth keeping, though I wouldn not recommend it."
5,One of Hazel Scott's best--but a different sound that usual.,"For those familiar with Hazel Scott's lightning fast piano pyrotechnics, this album may be a suprise. On this album, the Juliard-trained pianist performs relaxing, delicate pieces accompanied by bass, and unamplified guitar--no drums. However, her great technique, jazz phrasing and unique improvization make this an album I have played over and over since I got it. Despite the slow tempo, several of the songs manage to swing nicely. As you can see from the title list, most of the songs are not well known.The remastering is wonderful--the 1956-57 recordings sound like they could have been made yesterday. The CD comes in a cardboard sleeve like a tiny LP, with the entire CD itself being a reproduction of the old Decca label. It is pricey, but worth it for fans of Hazel Scott."
1,Awful,"Mine smelled funky almost egg like, like it was an expires product, product stunk and didn't work at all, and I've used epilstop when the product first came out, that original product was fabulous, the batch I got was yellow not white lotion and didn't remove a single hair..."
5,A slice of Americana,Perfect. This DVD is the most perfect form of entertainment. Your jaw will be unhinged. Enjoy and be entertained fully.
2,not enough content,Don't know how 2 others gave it FIVE stars. For HALF the price get Ukulele Primer with DVD $10. This DVD just gave you the different chords and strumming (only 1 kind of strums). For beginners Hal Leonard DVD the best. Hal Leonard product always reliable!
5,Best band you've never heard,"Saw the group live in Ft Laudedale ,and thought they were good on first listening. I bought 3 of there cds Slap in the face,this cd and the singles.After a couple of plays have been totally won over by all tracks.Recommend buying the singles collection which is outstanding, every track 16 in all are absolutely fabulous.The other impressive thing is that they are all so different in style and pace.Do yourself a favour and give this group a listen i guarantee you won't be disappointed."
5,It's a MUST!,"Thanks to the help of a co-worker, I saw this movie. The music was FANTASTIC! The lead singer has a voice that is PURE blues! The music from this movie is just outta this world! You NEED this soundtrack to see what I mean!"
4,An enjoyable read,"I picked this book up in an airport while flying to a conference - and yes, I picked it up quite simply because as an academic myself I enjoy stories about academics... This one is a fun read, with the added benefit of giving me a little more knowledge about the Bront's life, which I found really interesting. The academic side of the novel wasn't always very convincing - I've never heard of a PhD student whose project is solely founded on the unlikely event that she find an unknown letter (where was this girl's advisor? what an un-finishable dissertation) - but I loved the raucous descriptions of Diana studies, and well, in general, it's an entertaining read, perfect if you have a few flights or want to curl up and read for fun after too much reading for work."
3,book review,"Up until the last chapter, this was a wonderful piece: great characterizations, great story, innovative..then, well, it went too far over the edge"
2,Doesn't seem to work very well,"I've known about this product for years and only recently decided to try it out. Well, it doesn't seem to get the dishes clean. There is a film and residual coloring on the dishes and the coffee mugs still have coffee film in them. I'll give them 2 stars for at least making a non phosphorus product, but I won't buy this again.Method makes a great biodegradable dishwashing soap and we're going to see if they make detergent as well."
1,doesn't clean well,"I love environmentally sound products/packaging & gave this a try. Unfortunately it leaves a film of dirt on plates, gritty deposits on other items & the stainless steel cutlery was badly marked. For a while I blamed our new dishwasher, but reverting to a previous DW powder confirmed that it is Planet that doesn't work. Cheaper than replacing the dishwasher again, but a shame to throw the rest of the product away. It also cakes up, even in dry conditions."
2,Disappointing,"Very disappointing results! At least half the dishwasher load needs to be soaked and washed again as coffee cups, dishes, cereal bowls and utensils have debris baked on. We must now wash all our dishes thoroughly BEFORE putting them in the dishwasher, just to use up the remainder of the box. Not environmentally friendly to use all this extra water, either."
1,a waste of money,"I like to try out environmentally friendly products to find the ones that work. This one doesn't make the grade. I used it once and threw out the rest of the box. It left a film and grit on my dishes. Anything with an edge or rim had grit on it. I have found that some dishwasher detergents are more effective than others, but I've never had such a poor result. I ended up rewashing things by hand."
1,Just doesn't work,"I needed to thoroughly rinse each glass/dish/utensil before putting it in the dishwasher, using more water than with other products, and then I would just end up wasting more water after running a load because I would have to rewash many of the dishes by hand."
1,poor washing results,We only bought one box. It just didn't work very well. Food residue film (from cream chesse for example) was a common problem. Our flatware had stains after washing in this. We won't buy it again.
1,Bad for the planet,"I have never felt compelled to write a product review before, but I must second the negative opinions expressed about this product. This ""detergent"" leaves a chalky film and undissolved particles on dishes. Resources and energy are wasted with extra wash cycles, rinses and hand washing to remove the residue. The company owes consumers at least an apology if not compensation for this product. Bottom line: Planet automatic dishwashing detergent will actually make dishes dirtier."
3,Could have been better.,"I would give Carnivores 2 a slightly lower quality rating than the original Carnivores. I can see now why original Carnivores is a better seller than Carnivores 2. The main problem with Carnivores 2 is that the dinosaurs are either too sensitive or too aggressive, more so than in Carnivores 1. The result of this is that either they can climb up steep cliffs giving the player hardly any protection places or else they run away too quickly at the slightest sight of the player. Luckily there's an edit file for modifying sensitivity in running away which helps improvement of play, but it doesn't do any good in lessening aggressiveness. Another fluke is the sun would glare in the eyes making it hard to see; Carnivores 1 didn't have this feature. The positive side of Carnivores 2 is that the 3D graphics are just as good as the original, and some cool new dinosaurs added. If you want to play this game successfully then just hunt the herbivores."
5,Great game.,"Ive always loved this game when I was a kid. I like the second one better, it has ""better graphics"" for being as old as it is."
1,What happened to this company?,"I purchased a new contractor's briefcase in January 2012 to replace the one I purchased back in 1999, which had finally started to show wear in the stitching. I was extremely happy with my previous briefcase; it lasted longer than I expected. Already, my new one has seams splitting in THREE places! I had to replace the strap with the one from my previous briefcase because it immediately started fraying. I doubt I will use my new one for more than a few months -- it just seems cheap and unreliable.With a ""quality"" product such as this I expected there would be some sort of replacement guarantee. In fact, Bucket Boss has almost no internet presence, and only a toll-free number. Calling the number allows you to leave a message, which is never answered (it has been a month since I called).Considering Bucket Boss' former quality, I'm very disappointed."
4,Compelling as well as historically correct,"This is Heather Graham's long-awaited fifth in her series about her native Florida in the early to mid 1800's and how she has intertwined her usual historical fastidiousness with a terrific story about the MacKenzie family. It was especially interesting to me as I live in Florida and I am a Civil War buff. She ties up loose ends well with several of the McKenzies, albeit a bit too ""quickly."" A terrific tie-in to Florida would have been (and may yet be if she decides on a sixth novel) would be the Battle of Olustee, the only major battle of the Civil War fought in Florida, which took place in February 1864. In closing, beginning with her usual not-yet-lovers' antagonism (a-la And One Wore Gray) and ending in the manner in which it did end, one would think and most certainly look forward to a continuation of the McKenzie family series."
1,Car Cover,I recieved this cover and it was a little bit bigger than a pillowcase. It wasn't what was shown in the picture.
2,"Foolishly, I kept hoping that a plot would reveal itself and it would get better","Yes, Tyler, it is sexual harrassment! And Hailey, you are really stupid, weak-willed and desperate to have fallen for a man who had no qualms about using his kid to scare up a date from you. The heroine was supposed to be this perfect looking woman but she never once noticed that all these guys staring at her with longing, Never Ever?! The hero was boorish and overly confident. I find it hard to believe that a 28-year-old virgin who has been so protective of her heart would sucuumb so easily to an arrogant jerk the first time she was alone with him. This book had so many shortcomings: no plot, unlikable and unrelateable hero and heroine, stupid, contrived villain. I tried to persevere in reading the entire book, but I gave up in the last chapter, just couldn't do it. I hated myself for reading this dribble."
2,Boring and old-fashioned,"I like Sandra's books. That's why I read all of them. But some don't get a re-read. And this is one of them. The hero manipulates the girl, and she is very soft and gets in love with him -I don't know why. He is very dominant and she is not attractive at all. It has some moments, but it is not worth losing one's time with this book."
1,trite and uninspiring,"I was truly disappointed with this book. I couldn't even finish it. I couldn't find much likable or interesting about her main characters; in fact, I was embarrassed for Hailey Ashton: What modern career woman would be overcome with passion for a man whose ""techniques"" border on rape and sexual harrassment! I kept skimming through to find some ""meat"" to the plot. Couldn't do it so didn't finish it."
1,Deplorable!,"""Othello"" is a play that will show you how unredeemable human beings can be. It'll make you question everyone, along with his or her motives and beliefs. It also shows you how men lusted after women in the late 16th century, but how women could not lust after men. The double standard was put to the test, and, as always, women lose this battle. Women may sell themselves as whores, and are ridiculed for it, but the men who use their services are overlooked. This is a foul play and I think Shakespeare held women without regard. Othello was a despicable man who had little self-esteem I do not recommend."
4,"Challenging, but good!!","The book was very good, but it was hard to understand the language. The story is alot like today's times. Desdemona's father did not believe in her chose of a husband, because of the race issue."
4,We'll miss it,"Almost the best slide film ever, surpassed only by its older and very missed brother: the late Kodachrome 25. Generations of photographer, amateurs and professionals alike, will get emotional thinking of it."
1,KODAK ARE A BUNCH OF CROOKS,I PURCHASED NUMEROUS KODAK PREPAID PROCESSING MAILERS BECAUSE I APPRECIATED THEIR HIGH QUALITY!!! KODAK DISCONTINUED PROCESSSING SERVICES AND HAS REFUSED TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THESE MAILERS. THESE MAILERS HAVE NO EXPIRATION DATES ON THEM!!! KODAK IS STILL IN BUSINESS!!!
1,Outdated Kodachrome 64 35mm film.,"I wanted to order a roll of 35mm Kodachrome 64 film to keep the color slides as a momento of a photographic icon and era gone by after about 73 years of being the world's flagship color film.I did receive some film and discovered it was over two years past its expiration date. I was not aware that any seller could sell anykind of film past the expiration date. I was invited to return the film to the supplier for a refund.It was quite disconcerting to discover the film I received isoutdated. Email communication with the seller about this has been goodHowever, I cannot give a high mark for selling outdated film."
4,great music... buy it.,"Justin Robertson builds on the good stuff of Instinct for Detection with a followup album that refuses to be categorized. Lots of funky tunes that owe more to bits of the past than the electronica flavour of the day... electronics, some guitars, funky beats, smooth lyrics coolly delivered, equals a great album and one that will sound good long after the current trend in dance music dies and is replaced by something else..."
3,Old UFO History,"Good read, but not curent by any means. There is some good history to be found in this book. Fair reading"
5,Cool Topic - Never Knew,This book sheds light on a subject that I was not very familiar with regarding underwater ufo's. It is very interesting and a great amount of material about underwater ufo's. I recommend this book. Good bedtime book to read.
5,My Kid Was Thrilled,What a gift fast service and just what he ask for...Definitely a place to reorder from... Wear great and a great look~
1,the only terrible griffith album,I am a great nanci fan. This album is so slick and overproduced that it is incredible that nanci ever released it. a pink sofa you should never buy.
2,who produced this?!,Nanci is one of my favorites. Her talant is unquestioned but whoever produced this album missed the mark by a huge margin. I think that the reverse gated snare drum is second in the mix only to her voice. It sounds like the producer was trying to go pop country with this album. I hate it. And I really like Nanci. The songs are great but unless you want to hear Nanci play with a bad rock n roll band avoid this one.
5,Great Reference,This is a great reference book. I gave it to my husband who is a vet tech. He keeps it at the clinic so everyone can use it.
2,Bad bad bad,"CHOOSE ONE SIZE HIGHER! I had to return these because they were too small. They need to list the dimensions. The circumference is fine at the joints, but not in the middle. Also, the term ""leggings"" means they ONLY cover your shins! These are not chaps not chinks. They keep your boots covered, did stay in place, and were cushioned, but I did not like them.You are also not able to see that they have velcro all down the side to open and wrap your legs. I can imagine that even if these are functional, they must be tight. The elastic at the bottom was a pain. Just get the real thing."
2,"Bought 2, 1 was a dud","Bought 2. 1 was a dud. Seem to be cheaply manufactured. Sturdy plastic and magnetic base are pluses, but having a dud out of the box soured my enthusiasm."
4,LED Road Flare,"I drilled two holes in the back and screwed to the back of my bike. I wanted to be seen better than the typical bike light. It works great, but the button is a little tricky. Sometimes when pushing it on, the light stays on, then push it again for the blinking mode. Sometimes the blinking mode comes on first... but that's minor."
4,Good knife,I love this knife! I use it whenever I have a chance to and I have yet to have a problem with it. It's not near as flimsy as previous knives I've used.
2,Caveat emptor,"The low price was nice, but the knife wasn't worth what I paid. It arrived dull and I have not been able to make it sharp. Never had this problem with more expensive knives from Henckels or Caphalon."
5,A necessity when stuffing poultry,"Before I started using the trussing needle, I used a regular needle and thread, and in desperate times, a steel lacing pin with the shortest tip bent to hook the twine and a pair of pliers to pull the steel lacer through the poultry. After both those experiences, I must say that cooking is much more fun when you don't have added angst from struggling with simple tasks because you don't have the proper tools. This trussing needle is just the right length to adjust for the size of the bird and the point is sharp so that is pierces through easily. To see what sort of recipes include this tool, take a look at the Super Natural Samgyetang recipe athttp://www.myepikorean.com/2008/01/samgyetang-korean-chicken-ginseng-soup.html"
1,Don't Buy Women's Supplex Ankle Pant - 1562,Women's Supplex Ankle Pant - 1562 This product is way to stift to do any working out in it. It does not let you move freely. I feels like its more girdle like. I will have to wear these pants under regular clothes when its cold. I bought them to workout in. I am very dissappointed! These are ok to wear under your clothes when its windy out . But don't think you can work out in them! I spin and do step and they added too much resistance while I was working out.
3,They run a bit big,"I got them before in size medium and small as well. I am 5'2 and weigh about 140 and the size medium is too big. They tend to slide down a bit and during workout/run that can be annoying. But small fit perfectly. While they are still the best leggings out there, they tend to be expensive for the value and I must agree with some of the rather negative reviews as well. One of my pair ripped on the seam. If I am going to pay $32 for a pair of leggings I expect them to last a while.Danskin Women's Supplex Capri"
3,i miss Hans Zimmer's score on this one,"i agree with other reviewers ! i bought this CD for the org/ score ! for Hans Zimmer's score ! i should have known better ! only ""badlands"" is on there ! i sure miss the beautiful backgroundscore on this CD !!Hans ! if you read this !? Do something about this !"
4,Good Road Music,"This CD features some nice tracks for roadtripping (which, of course, is the point, since it's from a movie about a road trip gone wild). The BB King song, ""Better Not Look Down"", remains my favorite, while Glen Frey's ""Part of Me, Part of You"" is both touching and toe-tapping. Marianne Faithful's rendition of ""The Ballad of Lucy Jordan"" did eventually grow on me. Faithful's voice took some getting used to, but the lyrics were penned by one of my favorite childhood poets, Shel Silverstein...hence my desire to listen to it more closely. Finally, Hans Zimmer's haunting ""Thunderbird"" was an appropriate ending to the CD, and I would have been disappointed had it not been included on the soundtrack. So to any potential buyers, this soundtrack will make for a fun listen on a long trip down American roads. You might even want to rent a vintage convertible to make the experience complete."
1,Mezzoforte,Cannot play the dvd here in the U.S. The cd music can be played and sounds great... but not being able to watch the video is a real bummer.
3,pretty good,This book is pretty good. There is a really long boring scene in this book which caused me to give it 3 stars. In some scences I not know what they were talking about. The major reason that I liked this book a little bit was because Darth Maul is in it. Darth Maul is the best.
2,Hmmm....,"This book was good, but very sad. Everyone exept Darth Maul dies. I like Darth Maul very much, but when you but him in this kind of atmosphere, he is really nasty. I don't like how he chops off everones head when he sees them. This is a good book for Darth Maul killer lovers. Personally, I think it should have a happy ending rather than in the last sentince it describes how the main charachter and jedi dies. This book haptens right before Episode I. Please vote YES for my review."
2,Repetitive And A Dull Ending,"First of all, this book isn't really much about Darth Maul himself. It's more about some people running from him. A lot of the scenes seemed the same throughout the book and, to me, the ending just kind of fizzled out. The first half of the book was alright, but the main point I'm trying to make is that it's nothing how you would expect and it just doesn't give details about Maul's life and personality that you would expect in a book about Maul himself. So, it will do no harm to just save some time and money and just skip this one."
2,Can Darth Maul say.... DOH!!!,"I gave this book two stars because I finished it. I was looking for more character development about Darth Maul. I think everyone who purchased this book is looking for that also. This book is more about some obscure padawan and a couple of non-force users running from Darth Maul over and over. The sad part is that the book really isn't about Darth Maul at all, he just happens to be in it. I would recommend Darth Bane Path of Destruction instead of this. This book really doesn't give you anymore insight into Darth Maul then you may already know."
2,painting show but not a course,"It is a bit disappointing for the price. Also, I have seen more detailed demonstrations on youtube. I expected a little more. There is 1 cd exclusively about what he sells and so on and 2 about painting demonstrations at a very slow pace. I do not like to be negative but if I had red few comments ; that would of helped. Try to have it used. At least at the half of this price or less. If you like to see someone painting this is o.k. but not a very academic course. Few good tips. Hard to manage on the delayed explanations."
1,No driver available for Windows 7,"I bought this piece of junk in April, 2011. I had to delay installation due to unforseen circumstance. When I installed it in my Windows 7 rig, I found that it didn't work. Belkin support gave me the bad news, no Windows 7 driver. No drivers for versions beyond Windows XP and 2000.This information does not appear on the product page or the details page on Amazon.com. My assessment on this transaction is that it's a real screw job."
1,it's good,"Now this is how art should be done. I love that a 13 year old can do what famous artists think they can do just because hey are famous. She has as much, if not more talent than an artist educated in Paris."
3,Fun Glow Sticks,"These were a bit of a gag gift for my boyfriend, who likes to keep glow sticks from events as long as possible. I thought perhaps if he had a stash then he might not need to store them in the freezer. Haven't gotten to use too many of them so far but he's enjoying them. I was worried about them getting broken in shipping but the tube they came in seems to have prevented that."
3,Does the job but some didn't work,Perfect for our nighttime dance party while camping. Some of the sticks weren't as vibrant as others and some just didn't work. But since the tube came with so many I didn't have an issue with anyone being left out.
3,Had a broken one or two and the whole tube was greasy,"These mostly worked but there was one or more that were broken and the glow liquid leaked out causing all of the sticks to be greasy mess, which would have been amplified by 15 kids running around the house. We shelved these and used the ""finger"" flashlights that we also purchased. They were a total hit and no kids even remembered that we had these glow sticks. They went to the freezer where the still sit today waiting to be played with."
4,glowsticks,I had purchased the glow sticks for part of a childrens party and they all had a fun time with them.What an easy and inexpensive way for children to enjoy themselves.
4,Pleased,"I ordered these braclets in place of Halloween candy to pass out. The price was right and it seemed better than having to worry about food allergies with the candy I chose. We didn't use all 100 but we used about 75 as a guess. We had one break and the orange ones didn't glow very bright, however, all of them glowed at least a little, the blue was very bright and so was yellow and green, our pack had no pink in it. I would buy these again, they were cheap and a great alternative to candy."
1,"Most didn't work, and those that did were weak.","I ordered these for my daughter's birthday party... and was so disappointed with the quality. I would say maybe 20 of the 100 actually glowed. And those 20 were so weak you could barely see that they were glowing. I had them next to a glow stick from the dollar store, and dollar store item was much better quality. The kids were so disappointed that their bracelets didn't glow."
5,Glowsticks,My wife got these for our daughter's school PTO. They sold all of them for fundraising. The kids loved them.
3,Well...,"I have mixed thoughts about this. Basically the ones that were glowing, and intact, remained both glowing and intact well into the next day. But the ones that broke, namely the pink ones, leaked glow in the dark fluid over my clothes because they somehow cracked and broke...Not cool."
1,My worst buy ever on Amazon,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. I cannot believe this item actually qualified for Amazon Prime. Here's why: the box is in English, but it has lots of grammatical errors. The product inside has the same quality as the covering page: only a few of the glowsticks actually worked (for example, none of the red ones would light up at all). One of the sticks broke open and the liquid sprayed out (I'm glad I was wearing my glasses, so it didn't end up in my eyes). I don't think this is safe for your kids (or anyone) to use, I wouldn't purchase again."
4,Excited...then slightly irritated...,"Received these the other day and I was happy to see the packaging was bulked up to protect the item; however I was slightly disappointed that 5 were already activated. I mean 5 out of 100 is nowhere near a total disaster, and the remaining will definitely bring joy to those who will be using them, but this is more just a gentle reminder to company to be just that little bit more careful. Having said all that…will be back when it comes time to get more…can never have too many glow sticks!"
2,DISAPPOINTED,"My little grandson loves this character, so I was prettyupset when the DVD stopped playing in the middleof an episode"
4,Wow Wow Wubzy,Who doesnt' love Wubzy? My kids love this show. If your child loves Wubzy then he/she will love this adventure. I know my kids were glued to the tv and watched all 8 episodes...I was able to get a lot of cleaning done while they were watching. I definitely reccomend this product!
2,Don't like the design,"Good construction, good quality and plenty of room but I really don't like the design:1. the top flips outward is not easy to use.2. the accessory compartment inside of the top is too small. the spare battery had to be squeezed in."
5,Great product,"I recommend it, its a good quality .. i bought an Audio Technica mic and it works very nice with the cable"
5,Good Quality Cord,Not much to say about a cord really. It looks and feels like good quality workmanship and when I used it on a mic it worked at expected.
3,Raw and ragged,"This is a loose collection of live Earle music circa 1991. The band is just going through the motions and Earle's voice is at its most ragged, but it still remains an interesting time capsule of where Earle's career was at the time and some of the songs really thrive in the live setting. A good summation of Earle's earlier work and glimpse of an artist close to the edge of self destruction. Probably not the best example of his ability but an intriguing look at an artist whose life has had more than a few ups and downs."
5,Live in Concert Hall & Oates,If you seen the Heart & Soul Tour.. you will like this DVD.. Includes their most identified hits...
2,Uninspired concert video a real disappointement!,"As a die-hard fan of the founders of Philadelphia Funk, I wastruly taken aback and almost embarrassed for them after I struggled to get through this blatently bland performance. Yes, I have seen their live concerts twice in the past and own practically every song they ever recorded. But, this concert is so uninspired I would have been better off to buy the MTV musicvideo instead. Back in the mid 80's, HBO did a Hall & Oats concert special which was fantastic. Does anyone know if it's available for purchase somewhere? That's the concert video to own. They did a good job performing Me and Mrs Jones, but everything else sounds flat, contrived and forced. Even the bandfailed to excite. There was simply little enthusiasm here to merit a favorable review. PS: Saw them in concert 6/24/05 in Phoenix. They were fantastic...great performance. However, thisvideo is still unworthy of praise."
5,Hurricane In A Box,"I live year-round on a boat in a mid-Atlantic marina without shade. During the summer, interior temps soar into the 90s for weeks at a time; my 12,000 btu central air conditioning can't keep the salon below 83 degrees ... and last year's electric bills were staggering.Then I installed two Vector fans and they've got to be one of the absolute best investments I ever made. Sure they're noisier than deluxe $90 ""marine"" 12v fans, but I've tried a handful of $70-$90 ""cabin fans"" and they're Pitiful compared to the Vector's performance. The Vectors really WORK, move LOTS of air and slash cooling costs, which makes noise a non-issue for me (the fan's ""noise"" helps block out even noisier neighbors, especially late-night on party weekends :-)Highly, highly recommended ... I'm purchasing four more for the helm."
1,don't waste your money,Got this fan today. Plugged it in. Tried all speeds. Put it back in the box. Will return it tomorrow. It moves a good amount of air but has a strange cycling/rhythmic rubbing noise that I can't get to go away. I wanted to use it at night but this odd noise would just irritate.
3,Sharp but flimsy,"The knives include a good mix and are incredibly sharp. However, they are very flimsy and I don't expect them to last very long"
5,Working now! Very easy to change.,"First time changing anything on my Honda CR-V. Hardest part was figuring out how to undo the clips on the plug. I didn't take off any brackets at all. Old sensor came out easy, new one in just as easy. I did use the rubber bushing on the old sensor to hold the new sensor wire in the clip. After unhooking the negative battery terminal, check engine light was off, and I drove 5 miles and it still did not come back on. We'll see how it does in the future, but I am very happy with this part, and saved at least $200 by buying it off of here and changing it myself. Recommend that anyone can do this if you can use a wrench/socket!"
5,Great Deal,This item fit perfectly on my Rsx base. It worked great and was delivered 2 days ahead of schedule. No need to spend 3 times the amount at the Stealership. Love Amazon
